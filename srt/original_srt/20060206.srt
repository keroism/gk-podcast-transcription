1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,033
Speaker 1: It's Monday February 6th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:17,758
Speaker 1: We talk about instant messaging messaging messaging.

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,085
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:25,122
Speaker 0: So we were in good old Rochester this past weekend Great.

5
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:32,421
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had a quite a fun weekend lined up and kind of got pissed on a little bit a Lot.

6
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:33,488
Speaker 0: Well, let's see.

7
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:34,272
Speaker 0: It started out great.

8
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:35,560
Speaker 0: You know, we're driving back to Rochester.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,059
Speaker 0: We're going with two of our friends in Scott's brand-new Mazda 3 gonna be a good time.

10
00:00:40,903 --> 00:00:43,478
Speaker 0: Scott gets a little pulled over along the way.

11
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:49,760
Speaker 0: Great gets a little 80 and a 65 speeding ticket that he may or may not fight in court.

12
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:50,678
Speaker 1: Great.

13
00:00:51,663 --> 00:01:01,053
Speaker 0: And then we get to Rochester to discover that the main event that we had driven to Rochester for Had been canceled suddenly that morning by the board of the club that was running it.

14
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:05,577
Speaker 1: another very sarcastic single word Great Yeah.

15
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:14,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, wasn't a total loss though because we ended up just going to millennium games Which is the best freaking gaming store in the eastern seaboard as far as we're concerned.

16
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:17,880
Speaker 1: Well, as far as we know, I haven't heard of a better one.

17
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:20,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, we haven't heard ever found a better gaming store than this place.

18
00:01:20,962 --> 00:01:28,349
Speaker 0: We bought between all of us over three hundred dollars worth of board games Woot which amounted to what like five games?

19
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:28,670
Speaker 0: Yeah.

20
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:32,731
Speaker 0: Well, no, we got five games and then between our friends They got I think two more games.

21
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:33,297
Speaker 1: What did they get?

22
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:35,268
Speaker 0: Pete one of them bought Illuminati.

23
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,577
Speaker 1: Oh, right, right, right.

24
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:38,270
Speaker 1: Yeah That was it.

25
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:40,407
Speaker 0: No, I don't remember.

26
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:41,573
Speaker 1: Oh, we got else bunny.

27
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:47,756
Speaker 0: We got Attica Citadel's through the desert and deck are and Stratego.

28
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:56,200
Speaker 0: Whoo Yeah, Stratego is a farm, but we'll talk about all that on a gaming day Tomorrow and probably the next week on Tuesday and the next week on Tuesday.

29
00:01:56,662 --> 00:02:00,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, but luckily we ran into all our friends and we pretty much salvaged the weekend as best we could.

30
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:02,760
Speaker 1: We salvaged a little bit man.

31
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,640
Speaker 1: It feels like mech warrior mercenaries and you blow up all the enemies and you pick up like a laser.

32
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,352
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I had a better time than you since one.

33
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:16,516
Speaker 0: I didn't fall asleep early Saturday night So I actually got to hang out with everyone.

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,800
Speaker 0: Mmm, yeah I mean there are about ten of us in a tiny apartment yelling and screaming and arguing philosophy and solipsism all that crap.

35
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:29,219
Speaker 0: Scott's asleep in the middle of the floor just kind of curled up with his coat over him like a blanket.

36
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,139
Speaker 1: That was cold and tired.

37
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:34,954
Speaker 0: We woke you up to give you wanton soup that you had ordered but forgotten about.

38
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:36,560
Speaker 1: I didn't forget about it.

39
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,587
Speaker 0: You seem to have forgotten about it.

40
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:39,419
Speaker 0: You didn't seem to know why we were waking you up.

41
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:41,065
Speaker 1: No, I I was.

42
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:49,738
Speaker 1: uh, I was semi awake like I was hearing some things here and there but you know Never put enough effort in to get up and then I knew food arrived.

43
00:02:49,859 --> 00:03:06,216
Speaker 0: So You know, I was just sleeping Whatever yeah, but at least anyway in the news Google did something that it's generated a lot of grousing from both sides and I think it was a good thing though But they delisted a spammer.

44
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:15,160
Speaker 1: essentially They did this all the time, but this is the first time they've done it Visibly because they've done it to other big companies but invisibly.

45
00:03:15,702 --> 00:03:18,451
Speaker 1: But now they did it visibly to a large important company.

46
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:21,927
Speaker 0: Not only that but they stood up and said yes, we did this We'll do it again.

47
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:29,544
Speaker 1: Well, it was a guy On his official Google worker on his blog said it It wasn't like a Google press.

48
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:34,597
Speaker 0: what happened was the German BMW site was doing something kind of shady.

49
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:43,951
Speaker 0: I Mean, yeah, everyone knows that Google uses page rank which is a complex trade secret Algorithm for determining how useful a website is based on what you're searching for

50
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:58,020
Speaker 1: and people try to reverse engineer and figure out how page rank Works so that they can make pages all around the internet to raise the page ranks of other pages So that they will show up on Google very high up when someone searches for something.

51
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:04,919
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of the basics are that linking to a page Will boost its page rank as long as the link comes from a useful page.

52
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:13,819
Speaker 0: Like there was a problem not too long ago where blogs were ruining Google because blogs all linked to each other in this kind of incestuous link pile of links.

53
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:19,793
Speaker 0: So what they did is they just decided that links between blogs don't count and that solved that.

54
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:23,249
Speaker 0: and they've done various things like that Over the years to tweak their page.

55
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:25,603
Speaker 1: sure if that's exactly what they did That's that's what they did.

56
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:29,940
Speaker 0: to a point links from blogs are not weighted as highly as other links anymore.

57
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:30,422
Speaker 0: Yeah,

58
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:47,259
Speaker 1: they also had a problem where people would go around to different blogs posting in the comments section where then you know, I would go to a hundred blogs and Comment on those in stories on those blogs and in those comments put links to my site and that would make my rank go up.

59
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:57,734
Speaker 1: But now this is the thing where you in the link you say rel equals no follow And that basically means Google completely ignores that link in terms of page ranking or anything.

60
00:04:57,895 --> 00:04:59,880
Speaker 0: Thus removing the incentive to spam blog.

61
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, so now all blogs automatic all good blogs automatically put in the little no follow thing.

62
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:09,198
Speaker 1: So there's no point in spamming the comments to raise your raise your page rank anymore.

63
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:22,960
Speaker 0: now We don't know exactly who did the BMW site but either they did it themselves Internally either knowingly or unknowingly or they hired what is called an SEO or a search engine optimizer.

64
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:26,252
Speaker 0: Now you might see spam from these people occasionally.

65
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:28,320
Speaker 0: you probably find them when you search on various search engines.

66
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,617
Speaker 0: SEOs are about a micrometer above spammers in terms of ethics and morals.

67
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,503
Speaker 1: now as far as I'm concerned They're on the same level.

68
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:41,760
Speaker 1: They're just internet scum people who are using the internet to scam the internet itself and make money.

69
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:47,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll charge you money and they'll Optimize in quotes your site to make it appear higher in Google

70
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:53,135
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and they'll do things to other sites like spam them to make your rank higher in Google

71
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:59,861
Speaker 0: or they'll run massive Networks of fake sites that all link to each other to have their own high page rank and then they'll link to you from that Network.

72
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:03,571
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm all sorts of things and looks like BMW dot-com.

73
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:07,914
Speaker 0: dot-de did something like that because they were doing a lot of shady things on their site.

74
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,681
Speaker 1: Specifically the one thing that you're really not allowed to do is you have a web page and the web page is a bunch of Text.

75
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:19,280
Speaker 1: but then you have some JavaScript that edits all the content on the page.

76
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,999
Speaker 1: So when you visit it, it looks like a normal web page.

77
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:29,657
Speaker 1: But if you actually look at the source code of the page There's a whole bunch of words in there like used car used car used car used car.

78
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:30,339
Speaker 1: that shouldn't be there.

79
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:38,963
Speaker 0: So when Google noticed this on the BMW German site instead of just quietly adjusting or ignoring it they De-listed them.

80
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:49,377
Speaker 0: they dropped their page rank to zero remove the cache and basically unless you search for the URL itself all of the BMW Germany site you can't find it in Google anymore period.

81
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,027
Speaker 1: yeah I mean you can get it by.

82
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:58,660
Speaker 1: I'm sure if you went to the thousandth thousandth thousandth page It might be there, but I wasn't about to click that far.

83
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,315
Speaker 1: I tried I got to like a few hundred pages down and I couldn't find it.

84
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:13,820
Speaker 0: so Page rank zero really sucks Yeah, so I guess the moral out here is don't use SEO's don't be a spamming jackass and follow the rules.

85
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:22,996
Speaker 1: Yeah, just if you're gonna make a web page for a reason just make it for that reason and don't try to grow up in The Google ranks, it's just who cares.

86
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:35,660
Speaker 0: now I saw on slash dot a lot of people especially web designers who are complaining about this and their main complaint Was that Google is quote dictating to me how to design my website.

87
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:40,420
Speaker 0: Because if you don't know Google one of the page rank things is it looks at the content of your site.

88
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:49,440
Speaker 0: It looks at your HTML that looks at your CSS It looks at all sorts of things and it has various weightings based on how often the contents updated how it's arranged etc.

89
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:57,495
Speaker 0: Now if you have a site that's made entirely in flash say There's no information for the Google spider to get so your page ranks going to be crap.

90
00:07:57,515 --> 00:07:58,539
Speaker 0: no to how good your site is.

91
00:07:58,922 --> 00:08:04,372
Speaker 0: Well if a lot of people link to it you're all right Yep But they won't find it based on the content and it'll be kind of weighed.

92
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:05,095
Speaker 0: how they will.

93
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:17,640
Speaker 1: it depends on the content of the Links linking to you like if I post a comment in my blog that says check out this awesome flash site Then and that adds it so that if someone searches for awesome flash site you you might show up true.

94
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:30,737
Speaker 0: But if someone's searching for content on your site that might not be linked to directly But would appear on the site and would otherwise be found by Google spiders and waited It'll be weighted less because as far as ghouls concerned your site doesn't have as much content as it wants to see.

95
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:38,320
Speaker 0: yeah, maybe And I really knows for your HTML your site will be ranked more poorly even if your content looks identical.

96
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:44,562
Speaker 1: Oh well Yeah, if you use poor HTML, and that's that's just what happens because it's harder for the the spider to read it the way It's written.

97
00:08:44,763 --> 00:08:47,256
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also harder for my web browser to read it so knock it off.

98
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:49,759
Speaker 1: Yeah Make web pages well.

99
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:56,729
Speaker 0: But basically all the people I saw complaining about this decision by Google We're doing so for really kind of spurious reasons.

100
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,655
Speaker 0: They really didn't have any good arguments there.

101
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:03,820
Speaker 1: No I mean So wait Google is dictating to you how to make your website well number one.

102
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:06,337
Speaker 1: You're still free to make whatever website you want.

103
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,101
Speaker 1: yeah What are you?

104
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,308
Speaker 1: you're trying to dictate to Google to rank you higher.

105
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:10,773
Speaker 0: Google isn't an ISP.

106
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:11,536
Speaker 0: Google isn't anything.

107
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:16,374
Speaker 0: Google is just a company That says we are going to present the internet to you in this way.

108
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:19,567
Speaker 0: if you like to see it in this way Please see it in this way.

109
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:21,657
Speaker 0: If not then please don't come to our website.

110
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:22,119
Speaker 0: We don't care.

111
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:25,552
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you know you don't have to do what Google says.

112
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:26,094
Speaker 1: what do you know?

113
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:27,540
Speaker 1: and if you want to give it if you?

114
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,559
Speaker 1: Want to go up in their page ranks well, then you know you have to be good and be good.

115
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,622
Speaker 1: anyway I mean what do you?

116
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:35,965
Speaker 1: I mean?

117
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:40,979
Speaker 1: this isn't like some computer system that is going around delisting people randomly.

118
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:49,900
Speaker 1: You know if you want to make a website that has different content, and then renders it all differently with JavaScript You can do that, and they probably won't do list you.

119
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:56,006
Speaker 1: This is like a very a person looking at it and saying whoa that's a spammer And they don't do it often.

120
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,319
Speaker 1: yep, so I wouldn't worry about it.

121
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:04,880
Speaker 0: I'm hoping in fact that this ushers in a new era of Google cracking down on shit websites that pretend to be real websites.

122
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:12,160
Speaker 1: I also think what it can do is if Google starts pushing people to obey certain web standards.

123
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:24,782
Speaker 1: Then perhaps like ie will become more useless in Firefox more useful because an ie won't render sites that are properly written to show up high in Google and Such and such.

124
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:25,785
Speaker 0: you know what?

125
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:30,098
Speaker 0: maybe the stupid experts exchange will finally disappear from Google.

126
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:30,680
Speaker 1: god damn you.

127
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:30,861
Speaker 1: X.

128
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,130
Speaker 0: I hate these so much.

129
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,640
Speaker 1: you know who beats experts exchange?

130
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:37,660
Speaker 0: How about those fake sites that just rip content from Wikipedia and put it in an HTML?

131
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,192
Speaker 0: So you'll find it, and then it's just a spam site when you go there.

132
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,580
Speaker 1: You know who beats experts exchange.

133
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:42,728
Speaker 1: bug me not.

134
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,937
Speaker 0: ah Bug me not yeah, but yeah bug me not.

135
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:53,820
Speaker 1: okay so This is guy who is an ice cream man an ice cream man.

136
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,036
Speaker 0: Eh as in he sells ice cream in a truck that goes ding ding ding ding ding.

137
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:57,177
Speaker 1: yeah.

138
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,060
Speaker 1: I remember when I was a kid the ice cream man would come down the street every day in the summer And we'd all run out to buy ice cream.

139
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,197
Speaker 0: Yeah, my parents always yell at me and tell me that it was a ripoff, but I don't know.

140
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:08,040
Speaker 0: it wasn't a ripoff.

141
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,608
Speaker 1: It was like a cone for a buck 25 cone.

142
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:10,934
Speaker 1: We don't?

143
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:19,740
Speaker 1: I always bought the WWF wrestler bar for it If I was gonna buy one of those I would get like the Mario with the bubblegum nose or something.

144
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,953
Speaker 0: No, it was all about either the Cookie Witch the WWF bar or Just a regular old cookie which the Cookie Witch is awesome.

145
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:28,520
Speaker 1: He had the greatest vanilla.

146
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,658
Speaker 1: I always got his vanilla on a cone and the cone was really good, too.

147
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:36,560
Speaker 1: Or I got the thing that was red white and blue on a stick, but of course the white tasted bad.

148
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:38,252
Speaker 1: There's only the red and the blue.

149
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:38,998
Speaker 1: that tasted good.

150
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:41,029
Speaker 1: So it was like red.

151
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:43,019
Speaker 1: you just cut the white off and hit the blue.

152
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:46,669
Speaker 1: But anyway, it was an ice cream man.

153
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:49,477
Speaker 1: Who is a pretty genius ice cream man?

154
00:11:49,517 --> 00:12:04,444
Speaker 1: according to me what he did is he's Pirated a whole bunch of PlayStation games a whole mess of them like wow That's a lot of PlayStation games, and he kept him in the back of his truck And he sold.

155
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,693
Speaker 1: so he was selling him and he sold him to kids.

156
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:08,580
Speaker 1: just burn CDs of games.

157
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:10,543
Speaker 1: They caught him.

158
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:14,858
Speaker 1: He had a whole bunch of games in the back of his truck, and now he's busted.

159
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,808
Speaker 0: now I wonder how they caught him.

160
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,678
Speaker 0: what kid would complain I?

161
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,109
Speaker 0: Don't know, but who could possibly have found out something?

162
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:27,431
Speaker 0: you know what someone didn't follow the rules of the playground Must not have been.

163
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:33,720
Speaker 1: maybe a parent maybe a Cops just saw him because they look out it for ice cream.

164
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,384
Speaker 1: Maybe like it.

165
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:37,280
Speaker 1: I know ice cream and go to like Little League games and stuff all the time.

166
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,179
Speaker 1: Maybe there was like a cop coach or something who knows.

167
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,460
Speaker 0: well I grew up in Detroit and more than once an ice cream man was busted for actually just selling drugs.

168
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:48,230
Speaker 0: Wow they drive around and they sell ice cream to kids.

169
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:53,892
Speaker 0: just fine, but if you gave the right code word They'd sell you drugs, but they accidentally sell drugs to.

170
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:56,060
Speaker 1: somebody said the code word by accident and then got busted.

171
00:12:56,743 --> 00:13:00,960
Speaker 0: No, I think the cops were just onto it anyway, and we're kind of keeping eyes out for him, okay?

172
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,317
Speaker 0: But it's just when a when an ice cream truck goes through a kiddie neighborhood and sells can't.

173
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:07,049
Speaker 1: oh well this guy Oh, he was in Britain.

174
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:18,717
Speaker 0: Maybe that's something to do with yeah You know goes to a kiddie neighborhood and sells ice cream and then goes to a ghetto And it's just like crazy looking middle-aged men standing around giving large sums of money to an ice cream man.

175
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:31,080
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway he had 4,000 DVDs CDs and games that were seized during a raid on On his business premises, so he didn't have all those in the truck.

176
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:35,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, so don't do that.

177
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,626
Speaker 0: But I think you just said he was cool.

178
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,834
Speaker 1: He is cool, but why not do it?

179
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:41,300
Speaker 0: just don't get caught I guess.

180
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:46,316
Speaker 1: But I mean seriously don't buy from the guy cuz you can totally download this stuff.

181
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:56,680
Speaker 0: There you go All right, so my thing of the day.

182
00:13:57,222 --> 00:14:00,658
Speaker 0: This is a little old, but that's just because we had the weekend lag here.

183
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,740
Speaker 0: But this here is a Super Mario Brothers one soundboard.

184
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:10,760
Speaker 0: It seems to have every single sound from the game, and it is quite fun amusing useful and interesting.

185
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,066
Speaker 1: I like it a lot.

186
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:12,809
Speaker 0: Yeah.

187
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,519
Speaker 0: We if we ever set up some more complex audio here Maybe we'll have it handy whenever we're doing the show.

188
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:20,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be cool.

189
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:26,645
Speaker 1: be like Dude, I made some mad money today Or Something like that.

190
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,313
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's all I got about that.

191
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:28,694
Speaker 0: It's cool.

192
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:29,136
Speaker 0: Check it out.

193
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,107
Speaker 1: hmm Well my thing we got.

194
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:39,153
Speaker 1: you might remember a while ago that some people made like Trailers for old movies, but they changed the themes.

195
00:14:39,273 --> 00:14:45,595
Speaker 1: so you like it was The Shining But it was a romantic comedy shining well.

196
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:51,212
Speaker 1: No that that's a feel-good movie But all the same whatever movies that we don't like.

197
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,000
Speaker 0: they turn West Side Story into a zombie thriller.

198
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:58,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, instead of a you know gang dancing singing thing.

199
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:08,650
Speaker 1: so some people decided to keep on keeping on with this little trend bit here and Usually when someone tries to copy something that's already done.

200
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:10,799
Speaker 1: They mess up, and it's not so good.

201
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:19,100
Speaker 1: But these people seem to have Kept the same level of quality and they've taken fight club and made a fight club trailer.

202
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a romantic comedy, and it's pretty good.

203
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:24,828
Speaker 1: All right, I liked it.

204
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,960
Speaker 1: You should watch it if you've seen fight club.

205
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:29,999
Speaker 1: Don't watch it if you haven't seen fight club because you'd be like what the fuck.

206
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, fight clubs fight club.

207
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:40,396
Speaker 0: for the any of you out there who haven't seen it is not really about fighting Although the fighting parts are kind of entertaining.

208
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:45,180
Speaker 0: yeah But it's one of those movies like the matrix where you get in to see it, and it's not at all what you expect.

209
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:46,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's exactly what it's.

210
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:48,075
Speaker 1: it came out around the same time.

211
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:48,940
Speaker 0: I think - yeah, I did.

212
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,227
Speaker 0: I actually didn't see it for a while.

213
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:51,594
Speaker 1: I didn't see fight club for a long.

214
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:52,840
Speaker 1: I saw matrix in the theaters.

215
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:55,050
Speaker 1: I didn't see fight club until way later.

216
00:15:55,071 --> 00:16:00,052
Speaker 1: I Think not to like 2,000 huh, though.

217
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:01,759
Speaker 0: I never saw the second matrix movie at all.

218
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:03,605
Speaker 1: You're not missing much.

219
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:09,004
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know if you cut the 20-minute Rave see now.

220
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:09,746
Speaker 1: It's not so bad.

221
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:12,517
Speaker 0: You know if you cut the key rape out of kagihime.

222
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:17,079
Speaker 1: It's not so bad Yeah, then it'll just be normal magic girl girl show which is pretty bad.

223
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:25,785
Speaker 0: So anyway, we decided since being science and technology day that we talk about instant messaging Especially since I just changed.

224
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:28,633
Speaker 0: I am clients today, so you're going with sigh all the way.

225
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:44,804
Speaker 0: well looking at version point one definitely 0.93 definitely not But basically instant messengers, you know AOL instant messenger ICQ MSN messenger jabber QQ Mm-hmm.

226
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:46,373
Speaker 0: yeah, none of you have ever heard of QQ.

227
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:47,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

228
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,335
Speaker 1: So let's start at the beginning here back in the ancient days when there was no real internet.

229
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:57,568
Speaker 1: It was dial up into Existing computer networks that were providing services.

230
00:16:57,588 --> 00:17:07,200
Speaker 1: You know to anyone dialed up into them such as the old prodigy BBS's CompuServe the original AOL that sort of thing.

231
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:10,000
Speaker 1: There really wasn't instant messaging.

232
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:13,089
Speaker 0: Yeah In fact the closest you got was on some BBS's.

233
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:17,819
Speaker 0: you could like message someone if they were online Like by sending them a short text string.

234
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,753
Speaker 1: Yeah, and on the old days and like Unix lands you could use like the chat program.

235
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:33,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, I talk you talk and whatever The Message windows had what's it called the message box check in the box guy, right?

236
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,579
Speaker 0: I never even knew what he was or ever used him in any way.

237
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:36,423
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was.

238
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:36,804
Speaker 1: basically.

239
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:46,920
Speaker 1: you could pop up messages and other people's computers if you had an old-school Windows for workgroup style LAN or like a novell whatever type whatever it was called.

240
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,889
Speaker 0: Now Scott and I both had very different early.

241
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:53,480
Speaker 0: I am experiences because we're not gonna cover the old old history.

242
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:59,138
Speaker 0: We're pretty much talking about the rise of AOL instant messenger and ICQ into what we have today.

243
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:04,656
Speaker 0: Yep That's when it really started anyway, and Scott was much more in the AOL instant messenger camp.

244
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:08,239
Speaker 0: I had ICQ though Yeah, but you seem to use AOL and like it more.

245
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:19,915
Speaker 0: Yeah And I started with ICQ and I actually never even touched AOL instant messenger other than trying it once and hating it Until I got to college and no one I knew at RIT used ICQ.

246
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:26,476
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Well, it all started because we used AOL the program, you know, the when AOL was.

247
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:27,880
Speaker 1: I think it was still is a program.

248
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:31,219
Speaker 1: I don't know why people still use it though, but I've never used or had AOL.

249
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:35,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, well AOL was like the only ISP we could get for a long time.

250
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:39,491
Speaker 1: Really the only ISP That was really like that would work.

251
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:41,380
Speaker 0: See I was on prodigy classic.

252
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:44,071
Speaker 1: We didn't we didn't have ISPs in the in that day.

253
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:47,484
Speaker 0: and then I switched from that to Wow Which money?

254
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:49,771
Speaker 0: it was the first one the first ISP.

255
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,840
Speaker 0: that was a flat rate monthly fee all you can access.

256
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:54,329
Speaker 0: It was like 20 bucks a month.

257
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:56,160
Speaker 0: It was fantastic and you know what?

258
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,045
Speaker 0: It was too good to be true.

259
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:59,160
Speaker 0: It went out of business about a year after it opened.

260
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:08,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had AOL with just 20 bucks a month for unlimited, but it Had some other ways of making money off of you, you know, cuz it was AOL.

261
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:09,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I was real.

262
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:12,195
Speaker 0: lucky me and my friend Ken we lived in.

263
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:17,773
Speaker 0: where we lived in sterling Michigan was actually way way back like 1996.

264
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:19,940
Speaker 0: They deployed cable modems as a test.

265
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:24,317
Speaker 0: So I've pretty much had broadband for most of my internet using life.

266
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:27,992
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, we had dial-up pretty much until I went to college.

267
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:28,574
Speaker 1: Wow.

268
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,120
Speaker 1: We had I had a 56 game modem.

269
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:33,927
Speaker 1: It worked well enough, but I didn't play 3d games online.

270
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:35,233
Speaker 1: but everything else was just fine.

271
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:39,399
Speaker 0: see before I got to college I remember thinking that a ping higher than 50 was terrible.

272
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:44,020
Speaker 0: Then I got to RIT and I remember thinking a ping higher than five was terrible.

273
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:54,732
Speaker 1: Actually, the 56 game modem was able to play like tribes to online pretty well because tribes to network code was written real Well, but yeah, that wasn't until I got back from college and we had DSL.

274
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:57,240
Speaker 0: Yeah back then games weren't so tolerant of latency.

275
00:19:57,693 --> 00:20:00,297
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean quake one and quake to quake one.

276
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:06,079
Speaker 0: literally What your lag time was was how long it took between when you clicked and when a rocket came out of the front of you?

277
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was terrible.

278
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:08,240
Speaker 1: anyway.

279
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:09,720
Speaker 1: Instant messaging.

280
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:17,682
Speaker 1: So AOL the program you chat rooms are the big thing because you know when I was a little kid high school middle school Whatever.

281
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:19,672
Speaker 1: Yeah going to chat rooms.

282
00:20:19,713 --> 00:20:20,658
Speaker 1: Talk to people.

283
00:20:20,778 --> 00:20:27,820
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah My first moniker on the internet for anyone who cares because you won't be able to find anything about me was origins.

284
00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:31,493
Speaker 0: I was origins on prodigy classic a fuck long time ago.

285
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:35,927
Speaker 1: I was taser 3-1-4-6-0 on AOL.

286
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:36,870
Speaker 0: Wow, you suck.

287
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:38,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, so so wait a minute.

288
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:38,616
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

289
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:39,940
Speaker 0: Where did you get that name?

290
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:46,566
Speaker 1: So there was his old DOS game, which I don't remember the name of the game But basically the way the game worked was.

291
00:20:46,606 --> 00:20:52,765
Speaker 1: you were in this car hover car thing that that also shot lasers or whatever And you would.

292
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:56,400
Speaker 1: you could go up down forward backward and rotate turn left and right.

293
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,779
Speaker 1: So it's kind of like a first-person driving game, but you didn't race.

294
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:13,280
Speaker 1: Imagine it was like an FPS but you could move up and down and But it was like but you're in a car You weren't shooting with your hand and you went around shooting other cars and it was an old DOS pixely thing.

295
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:15,971
Speaker 1: You couldn't type in a name in this game.

296
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:19,785
Speaker 1: We had to click on an existing nickname So I always click taser.

297
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:21,873
Speaker 0: Did you know what a taser was back then?

298
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:22,475
Speaker 1: Yes.

299
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:23,198
Speaker 1: Yes, they did.

300
00:21:23,218 --> 00:21:27,750
Speaker 1: Uh-huh But it was it afraid that's a cool name and then it was already name.

301
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:30,760
Speaker 1: also if you pick taser you also got to be green.

302
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,303
Speaker 1: That was key.

303
00:21:33,764 --> 00:21:37,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, we often have fights over who is going to be green in various German board games here, right?

304
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:40,070
Speaker 1: So Taser was my AOL name.

305
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:48,580
Speaker 1: now in AOL chat rooms If you double clicked on someone's name You would say you could like open up a little tiny chat with them and I never really thought of his instant messaging.

306
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,617
Speaker 1: It just thought as tiny chat with that person.

307
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:55,700
Speaker 1: But then they eventually made it so you could keep people on a buddy list.

308
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:57,366
Speaker 1: It wasn't really I am.

309
00:21:57,427 --> 00:22:02,447
Speaker 1: it was a buddy list first and you would put people on your buddy list And then he clicked on them.

310
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:10,060
Speaker 1: you would you know do a little messaging with them And then eventually they said you know what there are a lot of people who don't have AOL.

311
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:19,378
Speaker 1: they want to talk to AOL people and they made AOL instant messenger a separate program and It did all the things that aim inside of AOL did.

312
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:23,934
Speaker 0: Now I started in 1996 was the first time I ever used.

313
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:25,018
Speaker 0: real instant messaging.

314
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,100
Speaker 0: was ICQ when it was founded or it was built by Mirabilis company in Tel Aviv.

315
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:31,904
Speaker 1: Israelis made it.

316
00:22:32,246 --> 00:22:35,180
Speaker 0: Yep, and it was basically a standalone.

317
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:37,969
Speaker 0: I am thing but it was very.

318
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:41,400
Speaker 0: it was extremely fully featured and very light and generally very awesome.

319
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:43,816
Speaker 1: It was full of a ton of stuff.

320
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:49,960
Speaker 0: Yep It was very much not geared at people who didn't know a lot about the internet like you could check your email.

321
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:51,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can

322
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:54,406
Speaker 1: send SMS messages which I never figured out how to use

323
00:22:54,868 --> 00:23:10,640
Speaker 0: and the biggest thing about it was that it had it had the Stateful away messages where there are different types of away messages and you could program it to say if I'm in this kind of away Messages give me a message like give me a message without making a noise But if I'm in this away state don't give me anything and whatever.

324
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, AOL didn't have any.

325
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:14,572
Speaker 1: AOL still only has a way and not a way.

326
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:17,422
Speaker 1: it also didn't even have a way for a long Time.

327
00:23:17,683 --> 00:23:24,516
Speaker 0: it had two of my favorite features and these two alone are the reason that I used ICQ for most of my life until I got to college.

328
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:27,085
Speaker 0: one AOL instant messenger.

329
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,235
Speaker 0: you could only send a message to someone if you were both online.

330
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:35,902
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm ICQ if you were off it would just save your message in the server and give it to the person as soon as they got Online.

331
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:44,140
Speaker 1: well the logic of AOL was that if someone wasn't online You were that you were going to use aim to like talk to the person in a conversation just like a chat room.

332
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:54,679
Speaker 1: Yeah So that if you were gonna send them a message that you wanted them to get and they weren't available for a discussion You would send them an email because that's how it worked, you know in AOL the program.

333
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,886
Speaker 1: yeah, that was a logic in the instant messenger.

334
00:23:57,127 --> 00:24:05,080
Speaker 0: ICQ's logic was that it is a standalone communication medium and thus if you send a Message it would all you would always get there is guaranteed that the message would get there.

335
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,970
Speaker 0: So it was more like fast email instead of chatting.

336
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:10,840
Speaker 0: It was like it was instantaneous so you could just chat in the window.

337
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:16,917
Speaker 1: Yeah, you often chatted in the window, but it was a lot more like fast email and it was slightly geared away from.

338
00:24:16,937 --> 00:24:22,020
Speaker 1: you know Conversing unless you use the chat feature, which was a chat making a chat room.

339
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:29,340
Speaker 0: There was much easier to have a conversation though I got to say I had straight-up hour-long conversations with people just in the normal message.

340
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:31,831
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I did too because I did have ICQ.

341
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:40,077
Speaker 1: once I figured out you could run other Programs and minimize AOL and I ran ICQ when I talked to a whole bunch of people that you know people mostly people I didn't know.

342
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:42,567
Speaker 0: Yeah That was the one thing that talked to internet people.

343
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:45,156
Speaker 0: with it all of you out there today really miss.

344
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:46,220
Speaker 0: is that back?

345
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:56,179
Speaker 0: I don't want to sound like an old man, but back in our day when I am was a new thing Honestly, there were very few asshats on it because asshats couldn't figure out how to use it.

346
00:24:56,962 --> 00:25:00,752
Speaker 0: So especially more so ICQ than aim because every AOL user could use aim

347
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:08,500
Speaker 1: every AOL user was using aim and every non AOL user was using ICQ which included most of the world other than the u.s Yep

348
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,646
Speaker 0: Even so is basically

349
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,410
Speaker 1: most

350
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,078
Speaker 0: of the world uses ICQ or MSN.

351
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's basically on ICQ.

352
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:20,123
Speaker 1: in those early days was all the early internet adopters Worldwide.

353
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:26,879
Speaker 1: so most often your your odds of talking to like a British guy or an Israeli guy were pretty high.

354
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:37,620
Speaker 0: I mean, it was great because I honestly in high school I had no I mean I had friends in high school and whatever but I Really wasn't interested in most of the people that were near me physically in proximity.

355
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:40,833
Speaker 0: I however made a lot of interesting friends online.

356
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:41,677
Speaker 0: some of them I talked to.

357
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:47,440
Speaker 1: still to this day I didn't make friends online, but I did talk to random people about random stuff.

358
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:50,860
Speaker 0: Well, I did that and I kept talking to some of the same people over and over again.

359
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:59,213
Speaker 0: And like I have a friend in South Africa now just because I talked to him back in the day And I still talk to him occasionally Yeah, I never actually talked to anyone online.

360
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,080
Speaker 1: that much to be a friend with them.

361
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,200
Speaker 0: Well ICQ also made it really easy to find people to talk to.

362
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:06,381
Speaker 0: You could.

363
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:14,340
Speaker 0: they'd had a whole directory service built into it where you could put in information about yourself And you could say if you wanted to be searchable or not and people could just search for you.

364
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:15,569
Speaker 0: It was like a giant LDAP.

365
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:25,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember you could be online Or you could be free for chat and free for chat was like hey random people come talk to me And I did that you would just wait around and people would just come talk to you.

366
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:39,240
Speaker 1: and sometimes I would sit there just searching for like high school girls and People who like computers and people who are playing the same video game I was playing right now, and then trying to talk to them about it, and it worked a lot of the time

367
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:39,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, but

368
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:43,904
Speaker 1: sometimes I also remember sitting there for like 20 minutes not doing anything Just searching.

369
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:46,436
Speaker 0: see I always just had it on while I was doing other things.

370
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:47,280
Speaker 0: then someone would pop up.

371
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,820
Speaker 1: Hey, but like you I would add a whole bunch of buddies and then delete him because I never talked to him again.

372
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:54,534
Speaker 0: And yep, but think about what a different world is today.

373
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:58,660
Speaker 0: back in the day I was hoping for strangers to just say hi to me today.

374
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:05,100
Speaker 0: If I don't know immediately who you are when you talk to me you get deleted banned blocked within about three seconds.

375
00:27:05,342 --> 00:27:06,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I just don't want to deal with you.

376
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:09,198
Speaker 1: That was back in the day.

377
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:13,999
Speaker 0: Now the other feature of ICQ that I loved was invisible mode.

378
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:24,306
Speaker 0: You could put yourself in invisible mode and be online But no one could see that you were online unless you talk to them mm-hmm Or you could make a list of.

379
00:27:24,386 --> 00:27:31,940
Speaker 0: you could flag your some people in your buddy list as like ultra friends or whatever I forget Exactly, and they had the ability to see you when you were invisible.

380
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:36,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you could have like your inner circle of friends, then your outer circle of friends.

381
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:43,666
Speaker 1: That was good for when someone was annoying you But like right now or like you didn't want to talk to someone right now But you need to talk to someone else.

382
00:27:43,968 --> 00:27:53,278
Speaker 1: yep, then but you knew someone else is gonna bother you so you could be invisible and talk to the someone else and Then get a really online to get the other person to jump on and annoy you.

383
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:55,435
Speaker 0: yeah And aim never really implemented any of those things.

384
00:27:56,401 --> 00:28:01,960
Speaker 1: No, I mean, but I think aim really tried to keep it simple because most people who use it were a wellers.

385
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:10,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'll admit ICQ was not simple Yeah, and actually the interface of the normal ICQ program was never high quality.

386
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:16,333
Speaker 1: It was always blocky and There's even right-click and you get this gigantic context menu.

387
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:17,920
Speaker 0: you could edit that but you had to go edit it.

388
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,700
Speaker 1: It was a giant context menu with 90% of the options were just useless or crazy And they didn't make sense a lot of the time.

389
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you could customize it all but it took time.

390
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:26,280
Speaker 1: it took a lot.

391
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,631
Speaker 0: It was very much a Windows 3 1 style application.

392
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:32,180
Speaker 1: It was it still is the Windows 3 1 style.

393
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,403
Speaker 1: I think I haven't yet.

394
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:41,969
Speaker 0: well the thing is like most people in the world used ICQ and a lot of Americans use aim and then AOL bought ICQ.

395
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:42,713
Speaker 1: that was a lot.

396
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:43,839
Speaker 1: I was a while later though.

397
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did that.

398
00:28:45,264 --> 00:28:47,210
Speaker 1: by then there were a lot more competitors in the market.

399
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:53,047
Speaker 0: the only big competitors ever to really come out were yahoo messenger which not many people use to this day.

400
00:28:53,107 --> 00:29:05,200
Speaker 1: a lot of people are actually using yahoo messenger because it had these features like The webcam ness and the ability to do like the drawing chat where you can draw pictures on a shared canvas.

401
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:05,990
Speaker 0: Oh true.

402
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,699
Speaker 0: I forgot about that.

403
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:19,080
Speaker 1: yeah, yahoo added a bunch of those like happy little yahoo type things with like Java and whatever and A lot of people were using yahoo, you know when it came out to do those sorts of things with each other.

404
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:24,359
Speaker 1: Like I know people who would like they be AOL aim people, but they would have yahoo to do those other features.

405
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:26,817
Speaker 1: but MSN.

406
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,293
Speaker 1: Somehow MSN seems to have slowly built from no one uses that to.

407
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:33,236
Speaker 1: a bunch of people use it.

408
00:29:33,276 --> 00:29:33,958
Speaker 1: It's kind of scary.

409
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,989
Speaker 0: scarily enough India is where MSN is king.

410
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone uses MSN there.

411
00:29:40,102 --> 00:29:42,591
Speaker 1: It seems like more and more people using MSN here too.

412
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:57,560
Speaker 1: It's like the people use aim Seem to be the people who were AOL errs and then now that AOL is kind of dead The people who got internet for the first time after the age of AOL like since the age of cable modems.

413
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,826
Speaker 1: Those people are all MSN errs.

414
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:00,509
Speaker 1: Cuz what did they do?

415
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,420
Speaker 1: They turn on a computer and they have IE and MSN.

416
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,352
Speaker 1: They don't have aim.

417
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:06,398
Speaker 1: That's not on there.

418
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:22,532
Speaker 0: Now the thing about instant messaging networks and why it matters is that you can't talk to people on a different network Mm-hmm, so especially back in the day for us when there weren't these multi like trillion or GA You had to run the client of every network you connected to yep,

419
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:24,880
Speaker 1: and no one really wanted to run more clients.

420
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,970
Speaker 0: That was like yeah, especially back when RAM was scarce.

421
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:31,060
Speaker 1: Yeah running a wall and ICQ at the same time was about my limit.

422
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:35,196
Speaker 0: You would end up having to use whatever all your friends used.

423
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:35,598
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

424
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:44,939
Speaker 0: and when you move to college they're always the bitter wars where half the people used aim and half the people used ICQ and Eventually one half caved in and everyone used the same one.

425
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:48,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you just didn't make friends with people who used other.

426
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:49,380
Speaker 1: I am clients.

427
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:58,079
Speaker 1: I remember a couple times people like here's my MSN and then I never talked to them because they had an MSN and That was it and never met him again because I never talked to him.

428
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:04,600
Speaker 0: Of course There was that fanboy in line for the TMR concert at Otacon that we just gave made-up aim names to so we'd go away.

429
00:31:05,185 --> 00:31:10,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't ask me for my aim I'm not going to talk to you after I met you for five seconds at a con and you were annoying.

430
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,159
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

431
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:22,651
Speaker 0: I joined the dance dance revolution DDR maniacs forums a long time ago when I was trying to build a hard pad for DDR and Not even thinking I put my aim name in my profile.

432
00:31:22,952 --> 00:31:23,213
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

433
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:24,317
Speaker 0: to this day.

434
00:31:24,337 --> 00:31:29,640
Speaker 0: I Periodically get messages from punk kids asking me for help on making a DDR pad.

435
00:31:30,262 --> 00:31:39,037
Speaker 1: There's a point at which I had to set my a my g aim So that it would not accept messages from people not on my buddy list, but now that doesn't happen anymore.

436
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:39,558
Speaker 1: I'm alright.

437
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:49,576
Speaker 0: Yeah Now luckily Fairly recently as in within the last many years Multi protocol clients have come out and despite their best efforts.

438
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,519
Speaker 0: They can't keep them out.

439
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:59,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically people who don't know a lot about computers use one Instant messaging network and that's it because they just don't know how to use more.

440
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:04,160
Speaker 0: But the real the geeks out there connect to whatever I am networks they want.

441
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:06,820
Speaker 0: I have accounts on several of them and I just route them all through my gene.

442
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:16,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't use my ICQ anymore But for a while I had a jabber and ICQ and aim and IRC all running at the same time inside of gene.

443
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:17,202
Speaker 0: Yep.

444
00:32:17,263 --> 00:32:22,599
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is AOL and ICQ are the same now and ICQ number is the same as an AOL screen name.

445
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:28,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of you you can route to one through the other with some with some black magics and things.

446
00:32:28,802 --> 00:32:29,745
Speaker 0: It's not really black magic.

447
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:34,425
Speaker 0: if you have an AOL client and you add a number that happens to be an ICQ number It just adds the person.

448
00:32:34,445 --> 00:32:35,169
Speaker 0: does it really work?

449
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,431
Speaker 1: Yeah.

450
00:32:35,894 --> 00:32:36,940
Speaker 0: Wow and vice versa.

451
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,518
Speaker 1: I guess that's when they develop the Oscar which goes between right?

452
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,204
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, that was also the big thing.

453
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:44,751
Speaker 0: that AOL was screen name based.

454
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,256
Speaker 0: your screen name was unique.

455
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:47,058
Speaker 0: No matter what.

456
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:48,426
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm ICQ.

457
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:51,302
Speaker 0: you had a serial number and Your.

458
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:52,708
Speaker 0: you could pick whatever name you wanted.

459
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:54,837
Speaker 0: So there could be a million rims out there.

460
00:32:54,877 --> 00:32:55,420
Speaker 0: That's fine.

461
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:58,456
Speaker 0: Each rim had a different serial number and different user information.

462
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:04,834
Speaker 0: Yep, and I remember I had a. we had a five digit ICQ number that me and my brother shared.

463
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:11,957
Speaker 0: and the sad story is That later I got my own one and he got my own one and mine was one five.

464
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:16,653
Speaker 0: Oh three six one one, too Which is significantly longer than that awesome five digit number as was his.

465
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:21,699
Speaker 0: and then one day we saw on eBay The people were selling five and six digit numbers for a decent sum of money.

466
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:31,486
Speaker 0: And we remembered that we did not in fact know the password anymore and that the email account it had been pegged to was long Since gone sorrow.

467
00:33:31,506 --> 00:33:32,972
Speaker 0: Yeah, the account is dead.

468
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:34,417
Speaker 0: It's still out there.

469
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:35,140
Speaker 0: It's under the name.

470
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:38,148
Speaker 0: God I remember I could cry.

471
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:41,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, my old ICQ number was nine three five seven two seven seven six.

472
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:44,087
Speaker 0: Wow, it's funny how we still remember him.

473
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,840
Speaker 1: Well, actually the that wasn't my old ICQ number.

474
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,680
Speaker 1: That was the one that I got because you do you freeze to use aim for a while?

475
00:33:51,060 --> 00:34:00,799
Speaker 1: But yeah what I had before that as long as I could the one I had before that was was the same length and digits But it began with one and that was like years earlier.

476
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:05,976
Speaker 0: So, yeah, but now it doesn't matter just connect everything.

477
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:10,370
Speaker 0: yeah and Basically for us at least the wave of the future is Jabber.

478
00:34:11,013 --> 00:34:22,230
Speaker 1: Well Jabber has been around for a long time but now because aim seems to be crumbling a little bit and You know this big flux and I am networks everywhere.

479
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:22,630
Speaker 1: Yeah.

480
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,540
Speaker 0: Well, basically aims crumbling and there's no good alternative.

481
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like what can you use?

482
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,364
Speaker 1: MSN is poop Yahoo is boo.

483
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:34,572
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like the Yahoo clients and the Yahoo Network's kind of funky.

484
00:34:34,914 --> 00:34:43,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, everything is kind of poop and You know if you want I am to stick around and not fill up with all this kind of junk that happens on it.

485
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:47,496
Speaker 1: Jabber seems to be the way to go and Google's semi supporting it.

486
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:53,766
Speaker 0: So Now I best to describe Jabber because if you're technical at all You probably know how Jabber works at least on some level.

487
00:34:54,309 --> 00:35:02,160
Speaker 0: but to describe it in an entirely non-technical way with Jabber It's like email in that anyone can run a Jabber server anywhere.

488
00:35:02,582 --> 00:35:05,734
Speaker 0: We're running one on the front row crew comm servers right now for us.

489
00:35:06,056 --> 00:35:08,164
Speaker 1: No, don't tell them then Why not?

490
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:10,453
Speaker 1: They'll try to sign up to it then restrict it.

491
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:16,051
Speaker 0: I did great But basically we're running run now and anyone can run one.

492
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:28,028
Speaker 0: You can run run on your PC if you want tunnel the ports to the router whatever and Your name in Jabber is just whatever you want at like an email address Your server's address

493
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:32,470
Speaker 1: and if you don't want to set up a server I think Jabber org has a free server that anyone can

494
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:32,752
Speaker 0: use.

495
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:34,900
Speaker 0: Oh, there's dozens of free Jabber servers out there.

496
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you get Google Talk, it's basically just Jabber except it's whatever you want at gtalk Comm?

497
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:47,060
Speaker 0: I think yep, and there's a good chance that eventually gtalk Jabber for Google is going to open up.

498
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:50,839
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, but I think I read something where they opened it up.

499
00:35:51,746 --> 00:35:53,258
Speaker 1: But even if they didn't it doesn't matter.

500
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:57,999
Speaker 0: But the key thing is that everyone runs their own servers and the servers all talk to each other.

501
00:35:58,662 --> 00:36:06,706
Speaker 0: So there's no big bad company with its crazy EULA's in the way to bring things down or censor you or log Whatever you're saying or whatever evil they could do.

502
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:09,393
Speaker 1: and it's also free completely free.

503
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,918
Speaker 0: free as in speech and as in beer.

504
00:36:10,998 --> 00:36:15,420
Speaker 1: yep, and The way it works is so wide open in turn.

505
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:27,563
Speaker 1: You know like if you want to write a program that does something to aim You have to do all sorts of reverse engineering to figure out how aim works and all sorts of BS and Jabber It's just XML.

506
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:33,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, all it does is send plain XML over a standard TCP IP connection.

507
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:45,379
Speaker 0: So if you want to write programs that do awesome things with Jabber It's real easy like you could set it up where you could make your computer run a Jabber user And you could like ask it questions that would Google and get answers for you.

508
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:48,040
Speaker 1: Oh, you can make all kinds of crazy, or you could set it up.

509
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:54,453
Speaker 0: So if you taught you send a certain thing to it your Jabber guy It'll call someone's cell phone and leave a voicemail on it.

510
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,205
Speaker 1: mm-hmm almost anything Anything a computer can do.

511
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:10,040
Speaker 1: you basically can make it so that computer programs can talk to you via Jabber Or talk to each other via Jabber or that you can talk to computer programs via Jabber and tell them what to do.

512
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:13,454
Speaker 0: I always wanted to make a bot that would look through all.

513
00:37:13,495 --> 00:37:15,745
Speaker 0: I think someone else has this idea too and they were talking to me about it.

514
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:22,610
Speaker 0: that would look through all my logs of conversations I've had with people and Basically be a non interested rim bot.

515
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:24,176
Speaker 0: so I could set that on people.

516
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:25,140
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk to it them.

517
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,385
Speaker 1: I think someone already made that.

518
00:37:26,726 --> 00:37:28,373
Speaker 0: yeah, I should get it and see if it works.

519
00:37:28,895 --> 00:37:32,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jabber Also has other features like priority setting.

520
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:32,999
Speaker 1: yeah.

521
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:42,700
Speaker 0: So say like a lot of people will have either one AOL account And they log into it all over the place which causes all sorts of hell Mm-hmm or they'll have a bunch of AOL like I have my name.

522
00:37:43,403 --> 00:37:51,479
Speaker 0: then I have my secret name name that only a few people know and I use that one at work or when I'm on the road and It's kind of a pain in the ass to have two different names.

523
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:57,655
Speaker 0: Jabber you just had a priority so Messages will always go to the highest priority client.

524
00:37:58,438 --> 00:37:58,740
Speaker 0: That's all.

525
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:02,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can do whatever you want.

526
00:38:02,187 --> 00:38:04,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, you set a resource and a priority.

527
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:10,800
Speaker 1: so let's say I log in on my desktop I call the resource desktop, and I set a priority of I don't know zero.

528
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:20,220
Speaker 1: then I go To my laptop and I sign in and I set the resource to laptop and I said the priority to five.

529
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:27,780
Speaker 1: Now if someone sends a message to me at me calm whatever I am It'll go to the laptop because it has a higher priority.

530
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:30,495
Speaker 0: But if the laptop logs off it'll go to his main one instead.

531
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:35,480
Speaker 1: yep now Let's say someone sends a message to me at me calm slash desktop.

532
00:38:35,962 --> 00:38:40,879
Speaker 1: They can specifically say they want it to go to my desktop computer and not to my laptop where I am now.

533
00:38:41,643 --> 00:38:44,957
Speaker 1: And they can say different status messages for different places.

534
00:38:45,037 --> 00:38:52,480
Speaker 1: I could be like I'm away at my laptop, but I'm do not disturb on my desktop, and I'm here on my telephone.

535
00:38:53,521 --> 00:39:00,560
Speaker 0: Also handy-dandy many ways of encrypting things and It is really great jabber is like zombocom.

536
00:39:01,744 --> 00:39:02,730
Speaker 1: It can do anything.

537
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:14,197
Speaker 1: you can do anything Anything anything is possible, but the problem with jabber is That the only way to make things in jabber work is to use a proper jabber client.

538
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:19,656
Speaker 0: gee aim I love you, but why don't you support the freaking priorities in jabber?

539
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:20,660
Speaker 0: It's an integer.

540
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:24,555
Speaker 1: It doesn't support any of the features of jabber except talking to people.

541
00:39:24,877 --> 00:39:25,740
Speaker 1: jabber has this mountain.

542
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,209
Speaker 0: You can set your resource name.

543
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:28,697
Speaker 1: You can set your resource name.

544
00:39:28,738 --> 00:39:29,039
Speaker 1: That's it.

545
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,931
Speaker 1: It doesn't support any of the other important jabber features.

546
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:34,280
Speaker 0: takes me off because other than that gee aim is beautiful.

547
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:42,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, look GM supports more features in the closed and secret AOL than in the wide open public jabber protocol.

548
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:43,052
Speaker 1: come on.

549
00:39:44,702 --> 00:39:53,568
Speaker 1: But anyway if you use psi or Exodus or any of the other real jabber clients You can do all the things that jabber does But you don't need to.

550
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:59,915
Speaker 0: I mean if you aren't a power user And you're just using your regular AOL name and you just have one and you just kind of use it.

551
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:05,340
Speaker 0: however if you just use Gee aim or a trillion to connect to jabber you'll be just fine.

552
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,505
Speaker 0: You don't worry about all that.

553
00:40:06,766 --> 00:40:08,333
Speaker 1: you just message people back and forth.

554
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:09,397
Speaker 1: It's like normal.

555
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:13,312
Speaker 0: Yep I also like the fact that my name is now exactly what I want.

556
00:40:13,352 --> 00:40:15,320
Speaker 0: I'm rim at front row crew calm.

557
00:40:15,682 --> 00:40:22,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm all me as opposed to shazar 105 Or one five oh three six one one two.

558
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:24,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, that that's really cool.

559
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,499
Speaker 1: So a lot of people don't realize there's this.

560
00:40:30,702 --> 00:40:32,449
Speaker 1: I don't know what you want to call it controversy.

561
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,880
Speaker 0: Yeah disconnect schism, right?

562
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,193
Speaker 1: basically, what it is is every nerd in the world is intelligent.

563
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:39,639
Speaker 1: that's what makes the nerds.

564
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:45,160
Speaker 1: and When they type a message into their instant messenger, they want to send the message.

565
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:46,267
Speaker 1: They don't push enter.

566
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:48,199
Speaker 1: enter goes to the next line.

567
00:40:48,982 --> 00:40:54,020
Speaker 1: You know if they want to send the message they push control and enter at the same time.

568
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:56,963
Speaker 0: Well, basically where this started was ICQ.

569
00:40:57,284 --> 00:41:02,680
Speaker 0: by default was a text box and a send button and you typed your text and you had enter just made a new line.

570
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:07,880
Speaker 0: And when you were done typing your message, you either clicked on send or the shortcut control enter.

571
00:41:08,241 --> 00:41:12,052
Speaker 1: Yeah, now because that was ICQ wasn't really supposed to be a conversation.

572
00:41:12,132 --> 00:41:14,920
Speaker 1: You were actually sort of typing a semi email.

573
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:19,580
Speaker 1: So pushing enter to go to a new line made a lot more sense because they thought you're gonna write something big.

574
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:23,954
Speaker 0: So when I first switched to aim, I'd freaking send half messages to people left and right.

575
00:41:24,475 --> 00:41:26,463
Speaker 0: It's me off to no end Yep.

576
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:33,097
Speaker 1: Now the thing is when you want to send a message Control enter is the only way that makes sense.

577
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:38,800
Speaker 1: Because how else can you make a new line if you said enter to send the message?

578
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:41,559
Speaker 1: How do you send a message that is multiple lines long?

579
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:43,348
Speaker 0: You can set it so control enter.

580
00:41:43,388 --> 00:41:45,860
Speaker 1: it makes a carriage return but that makes no sense either.

581
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:46,908
Speaker 1: How can you type like that?

582
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:48,440
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of a good typing.

583
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:49,244
Speaker 0: It's hard to say.

584
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:51,959
Speaker 0: there's definitely a post hoc Proctor Hawk situation here.

585
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:57,054
Speaker 0: But in AOL enter sent the message and the way AOL was.

586
00:41:57,154 --> 00:41:59,220
Speaker 0: it seems that people sent very short messages.

587
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:03,579
Speaker 0: people would type a single sentence a single sentence and the single sentences would fly back and forth.

588
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,326
Speaker 0: and I've noticed that in AOL back in the day.

589
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:08,092
Speaker 0: and now people would type.

590
00:42:08,634 --> 00:42:13,080
Speaker 0: if they wanted to type a multi sentence message They type each sentence and send them one at a time.

591
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,836
Speaker 0: So you'll send someone three or four messages before they respond to you in ICQ.

592
00:42:17,896 --> 00:42:19,160
Speaker 0: I remember very specifically.

593
00:42:19,742 --> 00:42:23,015
Speaker 0: I would send like a paragraph to someone and then a minute later.

594
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:24,280
Speaker 0: They'd send a paragraph back to me.

595
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:34,188
Speaker 1: well, I think the reason I usually I usually send one sentence at a time when I'm gonna say a bunch of stuff is because Aim only has a certain limit of characters.

596
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,311
Speaker 1: You can send in one message.

597
00:42:35,532 --> 00:42:37,980
Speaker 0: Yes ICQ is message limit was much greater.

598
00:42:38,363 --> 00:42:39,734
Speaker 1: I don't think jabber has a limit.

599
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:40,380
Speaker 1: I had to go check.

600
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:46,019
Speaker 0: I found that it does at least through GA because when I send you a large message it automatically splits it into two or three.

601
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,224
Speaker 1: That might be GM.

602
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:49,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, or it might be our jabber server.

603
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:50,456
Speaker 1: I don't think it's the jabbers.

604
00:42:50,537 --> 00:42:51,300
Speaker 1: I'll go check it out.

605
00:42:51,581 --> 00:43:01,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, because sending large messages, you know, especially Sometimes you're having a conversation, but sometimes you're you're sending someone something That's not quite an email and not quite an.

606
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:05,079
Speaker 1: I am like you're sending them a link and a description of it.

607
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,140
Speaker 0: You're giving someone driving directions to somewhere.

608
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:20,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, like go left go right go left go right, you know, you type that, you know, whatever I mean I guess that the interesting thing I've noticed is that it used to be that instant messaging was definite was a lossy kind of.

609
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:25,458
Speaker 0: you know, you just talk to people whenever an email was like the the communication of record.

610
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:32,080
Speaker 0: Now to me email is lossy and I don't trust email to get anywhere and I don't trust that anyone gets an email I send.

611
00:43:32,922 --> 00:43:34,928
Speaker 1: Well, I trust that they'll get the email.

612
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:39,985
Speaker 1: the thing is I don't trust if they'll actually go and read it and email is sort Of like sending a letter.

613
00:43:40,105 --> 00:43:44,080
Speaker 1: It's like this old-fashioned thing and I am is what used to communicate with people.

614
00:43:44,281 --> 00:43:46,414
Speaker 0: I mean, honestly, I leave my computer on 24/7 all the time.

615
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:56,259
Speaker 0: my I am is always on and it's always been on since 1996 when I first got ICQ and I would just use it like email and like instant messaging all rolled into one.

616
00:43:56,821 --> 00:44:10,660
Speaker 1: Yep, I be I'm logged into aim or jabber most of the time during the day and night, you know sometimes it goes off a little bit maybe when I'm on my way to work or something, but Eventually, I'll have a cell phone that can log into jabber in some way and I'll be all set.

617
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:12,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can log into aim on my cell phone.

618
00:44:12,855 --> 00:44:13,559
Speaker 0: It's just not worth it.

619
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:23,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean well the blackberry can do it But it really sucks because what it does is convert every message into an email which is terrible on the blackberry interface, right?

620
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:31,519
Speaker 1: You know, I'm think I can pay money for a real client Which I might do someday in the future if the client is quality enough, but we'll see.

621
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:39,660
Speaker 0: Well at any rate, I think we've talked enough about that for now since we've got a good half-hour just on this Mm-hmm, but I think we're gonna do another show on this sometime.

622
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,960
Speaker 0: I think we'd like to cover the kind of culture of instant messaging.

623
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:52,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the smile all the smiley faces and crap you see today and where they came from and honestly There are different dialects of smiley and it's kind of interesting to see.

624
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:56,225
Speaker 0: like like to the types of smiley is the different types Of people tend to use.

625
00:44:56,305 --> 00:44:57,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get to that.

626
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:58,576
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that'll be another show.

627
00:44:58,596 --> 00:44:59,279
