00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,745

00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:24,352
Speaker 1: Uh-huh so can you guess why?

29
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:25,696

00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,626
Speaker 1: Oh Like what he?

32
00:01:29,686 --> 00:01:34,143
Speaker 0: maybe he was a crazy killer who went to guys playing tennis and murdered them by cutting No one's off.

33
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,271
Speaker 1: No one murdered anyone in salad days.

34
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,379
Speaker 1: That was just a series of horrific accidents.

35
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:42,641
Speaker 0: Maybe he was just really accident-prone, dude Quotes.

36
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:57,040
Speaker 1: dad David Samuel Sam peckinpah February 21st 1925 to December 28th 1984 was an American film director and screenwriter who achieved prominence following the release of the Western epic the wild bunch.

37
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:58,325
Speaker 0: No, I know them.

38
00:01:58,446 --> 00:02:01,680
Speaker 1: I heard of that movie blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

39
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:06,220
Speaker 1: He was given the nickname bloody Sam owing to the violence in his films.

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,380
Speaker 1: His characters are often loners or losers who desire to be honorable But are forced to compromise in order to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality.

41
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,386
Speaker 0: I should go see that movie.

42
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:21,000
Speaker 1: didn't you notice in the salad days sketch that they're like directed by Sam peckinpah?

43
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,025
Speaker 1: No, that's the joke.

44
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:25,655
Speaker 1: It's not just the horrific accident.

45
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:29,602
Speaker 1: violence, okay Learn something new every day.

46
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:30,924
Speaker 0: There you go every day.

47
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:31,785
Speaker 0: Sure.

48
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:33,888
Speaker 1: So, uh got some news here.

49
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:41,174
Speaker 1: I'm kind of Shocked and amazed that regular media was really not covering this at all.

50
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:46,291
Speaker 1: And I'm not talking about in that sense of Republicans and Fox News being like but Benghazi.

51
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:48,138
Speaker 1: why doesn't anyone care about Benghazi?

52
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,600
Speaker 1: Yeah Talking about actual news is you don't care about Benghazi?

53
00:02:52,002 --> 00:03:01,080
Speaker 1: So the American media has been going crazy about Ebola But they're not going crazy about it in terms of the humanitarian crisis in the countries where it is occurring.

54
00:03:01,763 --> 00:03:04,616
Speaker 1: They're going crazy about it in the sense of oh my god.

55
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:05,419
Speaker 1: What if it comes here?

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,659
Speaker 1: Of course, but what they're not talking about is what happened in Toledo the other day.

57
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:12,387
Speaker 1: Okay, you know what happened in Toledo.

58
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:15,800
Speaker 0: I really couldn't give any fewer shits.

59
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:23,424
Speaker 0: Well, you wouldn't give any shit about anything that ever happens in Toledo, Ohio Unless for some reason.

60
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:29,236
Speaker 0: Toledo, Ohio decided to clear war in New York or something in which case I would sign up and shoot them in the face.

61
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:33,860
Speaker 0: But other than that, I don't care if a new kid Toledo, Ohio.

62
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,223
Speaker 0: Well, I still wouldn't care.

63
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:37,329
Speaker 1: you are familiar with the Toledo war right.

64
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:43,300
Speaker 1: that was between Michigan and Ohio Over the rights to the Toledo disputed.

65
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:48,480
Speaker 0: That's why the only thing I'm concerned with is maybe they might start that shit up again only pointed in the wrong direction.

66
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:50,267
Speaker 0: They're pretty far away.

67
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:53,320
Speaker 1: wait, so you're saying in the war between Ohio and Michigan you're on Michigan side.

68
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:58,780
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying if they decided to you know, take the warlike ways to New York, I don't give a shit.

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,752
Speaker 1: How would they even get here?

70
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,429
Speaker 0: Listen, they have cars.

71
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,398
Speaker 0: All right, it's modern times.

72
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,119
Speaker 0: They're more cars than we have because we don't drive.

73
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:12,000
Speaker 1: I look this war is great because belligerent state of Ohio territory of Michigan casualties and losses.

74
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:17,610
Speaker 1: Ohio lost nobody and Michigan had zero dead and one wounded.

75
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,136
Speaker 1: I think like 14 shots were fired.

76
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,870
Speaker 0: I'll tell you they start that shit up with New York.

77
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,240
Speaker 0: Those numbers gonna be a lot higher.

78
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:27,400
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go volunteer gonna sign up to be one of the dough boys.

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,803
Speaker 0: It will not be good for you people from the state with two O's in the name heading over on the Erie Canal to do Some some battling.

80
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:36,631
Speaker 1: Yeah now so what happened in Toledo?

81
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:39,719
Speaker 1: because a lot of people don't seem to realize that anything happened.

82
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:45,585
Speaker 1: There was some news about a water crisis And that's most of what people heard.

83
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:49,540
Speaker 0: what actually happened was something usually that shits out in California, Arizona.

84
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:54,207
Speaker 0: Yes run out of water So they have water there.

85
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,960
Speaker 0: It's not a no water place like Arizona so you can read the details about it.

86
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:07,490
Speaker 1: but the irony of the fact that this occurred in a city that borders the Great Lakes it Really tells you how much of an actual crisis this was.

87
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,880
Speaker 0: how couldn't they just start drinking a Great Lake water?

88
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:11,948
Speaker 1: Yes, it's got.

89
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:13,280
Speaker 1: they do drink Great Lakes water.

90
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,600
Speaker 1: Here's what happened to Lido and the entire metropolitan region around it, which is about a half a million.

91
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,268
Speaker 0: This did not affect Cleveland Columbus.

92
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:20,770
Speaker 0: It's now.

93
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:28,760
Speaker 1: it affected Toledo in a surrounding so about 500,000 people give or take were affected so almost Nova up on the grand scale of the country.

94
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,206
Speaker 1: That's bigger than a lot of places.

95
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:34,696
Speaker 0: It's less than it's always like my neighborhood's worth.

96
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:35,879
Speaker 1: It's more than Seattle.

97
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:42,082
Speaker 1: So Toledo Declared.

98
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:52,000
Speaker 1: they announced that there was an emergency and that nobody should drink the water Touch the water brush their teeth with the water cook with the water bathe with the water.

99
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,495
Speaker 0: How could the whole Great Lake be poisoned?

100
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:55,280
Speaker 0: That's impossible.

101
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:58,680
Speaker 0: Now the sheer amount of poison is impossible.

102
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:03,719
Speaker 1: Actually, it's very easy for that to happen and it was just the area around the reservoir intake thingy.

103
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,493
Speaker 1: So the reservoir intake thingy is massive and it's out in the middle of Lake Erie.

104
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:13,500
Speaker 1: obviously Lake Erie Has been having for a long time now algal blooms.

105
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:15,828
Speaker 0: So you did algae in the water?

106
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:18,159
Speaker 0: Yes, doesn't the water treatment center clean that shit out?

107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,060
Speaker 1: Uh, it's supposed to but one because we don't have the water treatment center because we don't invest in civil infrastructure.

108
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,252
Speaker 1: Toledo's water treatment system kind of old kind of shitty.

109
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:30,420
Speaker 1: so it broke and the intakes are near to the surface.

110
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:37,816
Speaker 1: No, what happened was the algae had a huge bloom More so than has happened in recent memory at least since they started testing clogged.

111
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:38,780
Speaker 0: it clogged the shit up.

112
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:44,560
Speaker 1: No, so this toxin was just created in such quantity that it could not be removed from the water.

113
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,939
Speaker 1: It also is very difficult to test for this toxin.

114
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,582
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

115
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:49,906
Speaker 0: you drink the water if you die?

116
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:53,900
Speaker 1: No, this toxin causes cumulative liver damage from what I can gather.

117
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:55,268
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not like.

118
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:57,300
Speaker 1: you're not from drinking it from being exposed to it.

119
00:06:58,381 --> 00:07:00,660
Speaker 1: People who have had liver problems.

120
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,699
Speaker 1: It's really lakes hepatitis from being near lakes that were also near farms or pig farms.

121
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:13,678
Speaker 1: Because what happens is fertilizer runoff and phosphates get into the water in like ponds algae go.

122
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,969
Speaker 1: Oh fuck There's more food here than we've ever had.

123
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,236
Speaker 1: So algae explodes everywhere.

124
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:20,589
Speaker 1: Just algae everywhere Yeah, and then the algae makes poison.

125
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,880
Speaker 0: can't they just go out into the lake and spray all the algaes to kill them off?

126
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:28,079
Speaker 0: Yes by putting poison in the water sure, but there are people from Ohio so we don't care.

127
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:29,966
Speaker 1: So there's already poison in the water.

128
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:32,574
Speaker 1: the the result of this can't make it worse.

129
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:42,713
Speaker 1: usually when there's a water Emergency like that in the civilized modern industrialized world I mean there aren't and daughters make can't do something at the water treatment facility.

130
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:44,399
Speaker 0: insert some new equipment that takes care of.

131
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,385
Speaker 1: that would Take probably years to put in place Money even then.

132
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:50,770
Speaker 0: Oh, all right, Ohio doesn't have any.

133
00:07:51,091 --> 00:08:07,071
Speaker 1: also the problem is that Lake Erie being shallow being Warmer due to global warming and he's pretty happy right and being increasingly flooded with fertilizer runoff due to largely Unregulated farms and golf courses of living in farm places.

134
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:07,292
Speaker 0: Yeah.

135
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,821
Speaker 1: Yeah, but places that could regulate and choose not to Mm-hmm.

136
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:16,020
Speaker 1: It's basically a perfect storm of everything conservatives believe don't happen or matter.

137
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:18,613
Speaker 1: Actually poison the water supply of a city.

138
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:22,066
Speaker 1: for three days The water was toxic and unusable.

139
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:27,440
Speaker 1: the National Guard had to be mobilized water had to be trucked in every store ran out of water.

140
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,579
Speaker 1: It was a disaster and people likely would have died.

141
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:40,138
Speaker 1: They suddenly declared after a few days that the poison levels had dropped below the line And thus it was okay to drink the water again.

142
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:42,707
Speaker 1: This is far from over.

143
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,619
Speaker 1: this could happen again at any point.

144
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,860
Speaker 0: now I'm much more concerned of Ohio declaring war in New York to take our treasured water supply.

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,886
Speaker 1: Why would they not declare war on Michigan?

146
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:56,619
Speaker 1: because Ohio has one great lake the shittiest great lake.

147
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,352
Speaker 0: granted It's not even that great.

148
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,139
Speaker 0: It's just the good way.

149
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:01,047
Speaker 1: The thing is it's the great lake.

150
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:03,939
Speaker 1: Lake Erie is still better than any other fucking lake in the world.

151
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:07,805
Speaker 1: What Lake Champlain.

152
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:09,973
Speaker 1: Lake Champlain is like a hundredth the size of like.

153
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:11,980
Speaker 0: I'm thinking of lakes like on the other side of the planet.

154
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,873
Speaker 0: There aren't that many lakes that big and those are the ones I thought of ours actually sees.

155
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:19,404
Speaker 1: so Ohio is on the smallest and Shittiest of the Great Lakes.

156
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:29,740
Speaker 1: Michigan has access to Lake Superior, which is pretty fucking awesome in terms of water to drink Mmm, and you know the other great lakes up there like Lake Superior, but that's clearly yeah.

157
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,108
Speaker 1: It's also deep and fucking cold the middle of summer.

158
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,116
Speaker 1: go there like August 30th on a sunny hundred degree day.

159
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:41,079
Speaker 0: That water is 32.1 degrees thing is you're so proud of these fucking lakes.

160
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:44,631
Speaker 0: Any none of these lakes even hold a candle to a sea.

161
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:50,107
Speaker 1: a sea is just unbeatable unless you want to drink the water Black Sea Red Sea Mediterranean Sea.

162
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:52,132
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't drink any of those.

163
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:53,877
Speaker 1: go drink some of the Dead Sea.

164
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:54,900
Speaker 1: What's it called again?

165
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,704
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

166
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,055
Speaker 0: You don't drink it you floating in.

167
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:59,667
Speaker 1: it's a The point of this news.

168
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,598
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna go do the play-by-play.

169
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,025
Speaker 1: Read about it.

170
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:03,990
Speaker 1: go read what happened.

171
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,940
Speaker 1: the news didn't cover it at all outside of that area.

172
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:15,440
Speaker 1: But think about for a second what just happened in the United States of America one of the most Industrialized and advanced countries in the world one of the safest water supplies in the world.

173
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,005
Speaker 0: Well depending on which state you're in.

174
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:21,280
Speaker 1: but even the shittiest states have better water here than most of the rest of the world.

175
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:22,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, where there's dysentery and shit.

176
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:23,311
Speaker 1: Yes.

177
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:28,920
Speaker 1: I mean when I go to India I have to drink bottled water even in like major cities in luxury hotels.

178
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:30,105
Speaker 1: That's fucked up.

179
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:32,817
Speaker 0: actual luxury hotels not hotels that just use the word luxury.

180
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:33,480
Speaker 0: exactly.

181
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:42,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in America in a normal city, I mean Toledo is not the smallest city It's actually on the scale of cities in the country one of the bigger cities.

182
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:56,710
Speaker 1: The entire water supply was poisoned and we could do nothing about it But for the fact that the algae just happened to recede enough to where the toxin levels drop just low enough where we'd say it's Okay to drink is the only reason the people are done.

183
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,793
Speaker 0: It's just not as much poison.

184
00:10:58,034 --> 00:11:04,360
Speaker 1: had they had this not subsided It's not out of the realm but a staged evacuation of the city would have had to occur.

185
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:09,285
Speaker 0: No, I mean, there's probably enough water for like a few people to say that Yeah, but I mean they were trucking it.

186
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:13,800
Speaker 1: They emptied pretty much every source of bottled water within the region.

187
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,676
Speaker 0: Couldn't they just seal the intake and then make a big pipe to somewhere else from where?

188
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:19,820
Speaker 1: how long do you think that would take?

189
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,454
Speaker 1: This shit is not fast to do.

190
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:23,544
Speaker 0: Make a pipe we have.

191
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:26,800
Speaker 1: how many decades did it take Scott to make a new pipe to New York?

192
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:29,279
Speaker 1: Even when we spent a lot of money, it's not easy.

193
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:32,489
Speaker 0: Well, I mean if you put the pipe above ground said underground you have to

194
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:44,999
Speaker 1: just consider the fact that this happened in the year 2014 in a city in the United States of America and the news gave zero fucks about it Despite the fact that this is an unresolved issue.

195
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:47,327
Speaker 1: This is fucked.

196
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:48,170
Speaker 1: Mmm.

197
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:49,714
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's my news.

198
00:11:50,156 --> 00:12:01,006
Speaker 0: You got something less depressing Yeah, so tomorrow we are going to go see Angry video game nerd movie.

199
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,611
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah in New York City.

200
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:05,060
Speaker 0: I mean, it's already been screened a bunch of places.

201
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:13,020
Speaker 0: I think it's being screened at PAX amongst other locations Yeah, but I don't want to spend packs hours my New York hours, but we're gonna go see it tomorrow.

202
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,406
Speaker 0: He's finally finished it right?

203
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:16,972
Speaker 0: He didn't shit talk good on him.

204
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:18,296
Speaker 0: We'll let you know how.

205
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:30,619
Speaker 0: it is Kind of somewhat exciting not because I think it's gonna be the greatest movie ever, but it could be good but because It's like there's this dude who've been watching all this time.

206
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:35,072
Speaker 1: Someone on that level like made a thing that's big enough to be screened at Lincoln Center.

207
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:37,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, well Lincoln Center ish area, right?

208
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:40,859
Speaker 0: You know, how come we haven't done anything?

209
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,137
Speaker 0: You know higher than our level because he is attacked only one.

210
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:45,539
Speaker 1: we have it.

211
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:48,240
Speaker 1: We have like half as it Lee attacked like a hundred things.

212
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:51,150
Speaker 1: So true, we're slowly stepping up the game.

213
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,440
Speaker 0: Why don't we quit everything then and just attack only one?

214
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:54,403
Speaker 1: I've thought about that.

215
00:12:54,423 --> 00:13:01,972
Speaker 1: remember with the savings we've got now you me and Emily could move to like the equivalent of beacon and live For like two years with no income.

216
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:05,879
Speaker 0: I was thinking the other day I read this article about what it takes to win this field this yarn.

217
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,065
Speaker 0: I was like, you know what?

218
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:10,200
Speaker 0: I just quit my job and just make games in forever until I win.

219
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,390
Speaker 1: I'm bringing my prototype game to packs to play.

220
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:13,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're not gonna win this field.

221
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:17,071
Speaker 0: this now It's like I should just concentrate on doing like.

222
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:20,616
Speaker 0: I should pick one thing like that If not that and just do that and only that.

223
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:22,348
Speaker 0: yeah I get it my my.

224
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:29,820
Speaker 1: that like my longest term goal I have in my world is someday I want to be important enough in the games industry to give the a keynote at apex.

225
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:39,054
Speaker 0: Imagine if I want to spiel this yard, like I go Germany and they give me the little red Scott Reuben on it has the red pond on it.

226
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:42,448
Speaker 1: if I won one I would tattoo that trophy on my body.

227
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:44,395
Speaker 0: someone I would do that, but it's like I could.

228
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,940
Speaker 0: just I could die with no regret.

229
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:50,369
Speaker 0: It's like oh, all right, I'm good.

230
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:52,521
Speaker 1: Oh and there's a side news I know.

231
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:53,324
Speaker 0: think about this right.

232
00:13:53,545 --> 00:14:00,932
Speaker 0: the Dominion dude Donald back arena, whatever motherfuckers got to Yeah, Dominion and then Kingdom builders one also, right?

233
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:02,117
Speaker 1: Oh did it?

234
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:05,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it did Yeah, so I got a little funny news to that.

235
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:28,351
Speaker 1: This is this is one of those stories that may be apocryphal and Gawker linked to it and a FARC and I found this whole tree and as far as I can tell the nearest source I can Get is a single post on reddit, but supposedly guy was in line at a Burger King and Behind him was the shitty little kid who's having a tantrum about how he wants some fucking pie And he's really mad.

236
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:30,379
Speaker 1: his mom's like fine I'll buy you some pie.

237
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:35,232
Speaker 1: So he being two people ahead of that family asked how many pies they had.

238
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:36,074
Speaker 1: It was only 23.

239
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,337
Speaker 1: So we bought them all.

240
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,484
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's it Mm-hmm.

241
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:57,939
Speaker 1: I found that was funny and mostly I'm curious Whether or not this happened and I'm curious why all these different news sites today decided to like Cannibalize off of each other into this like ouroboros circle jerk and linked to this thing.

242
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:01,939
Speaker 1: Okay, it's like a circle where I think they all link to each other and there's no origin.

243
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:17,300
Speaker 1: maybe things of the day But when we were young during our salad days One thing that we did we fancied a game of Mario Tennis.

244
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:19,625
Speaker 1: Nah we were.

245
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:38,925
Speaker 1: we were coming out of Wegmans after buying our groceries and Next to in like in the area of the lottery machine that one time I put five bucks into and I won like 40 bucks The only time I ever put money in that thing and next to it were the vending machines that had like vampire teeth blood Really shitty candy.

246
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:39,467
Speaker 1: Mmm.

247
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,880
Speaker 1: and one day Scott notices something called homies.

248
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:44,640
Speaker 1: Go over and look a little action.

249
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:52,437
Speaker 0: Well, they're not action figures, but little figurines little little, you know Plastic dudes and they were like little thug dudes called homies and they had.

250
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:53,220
Speaker 0: they had a lot of character.

251
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:54,192
Speaker 0: They're actually pretty funny.

252
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,443
Speaker 0: You're cool For 50 cents.

253
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:57,306
Speaker 1: They were pretty quality.

254
00:15:57,346 --> 00:16:05,273
Speaker 0: So I used to actually get him at the burger place of the train and Bill Gray's had the best homie machine man.

255
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:07,623
Speaker 1: I remember a lot of weird late nights Like we'd.

256
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:13,940
Speaker 1: it'd be like 930 and we're hungry and we're like, yeah Let's just go to Bill Gray's and no one else ever went with us.

257
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,442
Speaker 1: It was just like.

258
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:16,930
Speaker 0: that place is never crowded, but I know huge.

259
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,732
Speaker 1: It was huge.

260
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:19,177
Speaker 1: The food was mediocre.

261
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,020
Speaker 0: It was okay food.

262
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,980
Speaker 1: They didn't have air hockey, but they had that other hockey.

263
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,120
Speaker 0: You could get a fried chicken sandwich there.

264
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:25,284
Speaker 0: That was slightly.

265
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:29,197
Speaker 0: that was better than you could get at a fast-food place and that wasn't widely available.

266
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:35,469
Speaker 1: in retrospect I can't figure out why we ever went there instead of J's The diner.

267
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:37,924
Speaker 1: Yeah Like why?

268
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,960
Speaker 1: why was it when it was the two of us steak on French bread?

269
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:42,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I guess there's.

270
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:45,099
Speaker 0: you know, I just sit with a weight, you know weight service and whatnot.

271
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:46,062
Speaker 1: true It was faster.

272
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:47,046
Speaker 1: give it that.

273
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:50,940
Speaker 0: the place I always wanted to go was that there was like there's a place called moonshine barbecue.

274
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:54,280
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that drive-thru barbecue is just a barbecue restaurant.

275
00:16:54,746 --> 00:17:01,840
Speaker 0: But then they opened up mine She moonshine barbecue Express across the street from millennium and that you can get the best barbecue sandwich there.

276
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:04,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that didn't last very long.

277
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,619
Speaker 0: I think I was the only one who went there and then it was gone.

278
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,647
Speaker 1: I remember what's that weird sandwich place in that weird.

279
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:09,190
Speaker 1: now whenever?

280
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,385
Speaker 0: yeah, whenever I see a similar sandwich other elsewhere I get it.

281
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:17,500
Speaker 1: thing is if I went over there as much as I like that place I go to a meals and get one of those like chicken cordon bleu meals.

282
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,989
Speaker 0: Why'd you go to the palace which is a?

283
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,859
Speaker 0: we could literally walk completely different kinds of food.

284
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,166
Speaker 1: The Bellas is a saw but meals is a chicken sandwich.

285
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:25,073
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I digress.

286
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:25,513
Speaker 1: so we.

287
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:27,260
Speaker 1: we kind of collected these homies.

288
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:28,851
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a bunch of them.

289
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:29,659
Speaker 0: I found them the other day.

290
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,980
Speaker 1: Yeah I remember I kept the one that was the cop in the car is like a toad.

291
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,363
Speaker 1: Oh, we had.

292
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:37,546
Speaker 0: we got some doubles right because you're buying these Randomly from a from a machine.

293
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:44,880
Speaker 1: I basically I had like three of this one guy with a long face We're in like like a basketball shirt had bad luck and I had two of the cop.

294

296
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:51,412
Speaker 1: So, uh, here's the documentary vice documentary.

297
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:55,076
Speaker 0: when we these things were useful It wasn't just like we were collecting stupid figures in college.

298
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:55,620
Speaker 0: for no reason.

299
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:58,832
Speaker 0: We played a lot of cheap ass games that just kill dr.

300
00:17:58,872 --> 00:17:59,996
Speaker 0: Lucky which ended up being killed.

301
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:00,357
Speaker 1: dr.

302
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:00,719
Speaker 1: Homie

303
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:05,207
Speaker 0: kill dr Homie cuz you need you got to supply your own pawns Yeah, so

304
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:17,192
Speaker 1: so yeah If you ever wanted to know what the story was with homies because they were actually way bigger than we realized at the time This is a documentary about the guy who was responsible for the homie Empire.

305
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,680
Speaker 1: Well, let me tell you this is fascinating.

306
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:21,500
Speaker 1: This is depressing.

307
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:23,447
Speaker 1: So fair warning.

308
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:31,057
Speaker 1: if you watch this you're gonna see the most stereotypical Staten Island guy with his voice and I fuck this shit fucking mother fuck shit.

309
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:34,665
Speaker 0: Fuck and It's my homies.

310
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:35,628
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

311
00:18:35,688 --> 00:18:36,269
Speaker 1: It's so sad.

312
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:37,613
Speaker 1: 30 fucking dollars.

313
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,435
Speaker 1: These are 12 bucks.

314
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:39,358
Speaker 1: My man.

315
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:40,020
Speaker 1: I'll see you later.

316
00:18:41,002 --> 00:18:45,000
Speaker 1: That guy sounds like what a lifetime of misery and cigarettes does to the human soul.

317
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:56,784
Speaker 0: Okay, so there's a question I've had for a long time and I knew that it's probably I definitely had an answer that I could Find on the internet, but I just never actually went through the effort of finding the answer on the internet Until just now I did.

318
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:02,120
Speaker 0: the question was if you know see the giant ass crane building a skyscraper or something.

319
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:04,320
Speaker 0: How do they build that crane?

320
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,566
Speaker 0: How do they get it up there?

321
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:09,188
Speaker 1: a lot of people's response to that question is duh And then they trail off.

322
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,970
Speaker 0: is they can't really figure it out Of course, and you think oh another crane.

323
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,300
Speaker 0: obviously use some small cranes to get started.

324
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:18,612
Speaker 0: But here's a video on YouTube showing how a tower crane works.

325
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:19,476
Speaker 0: I'm gonna spoil it.

326
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:20,540
Speaker 0: It's really fascinating.

327
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,900
Speaker 0: So they build a small piece of the tower just by building with other cranes.

328
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:32,446
Speaker 0: then they put the little control, you know room and all that stuff on top right and It's a crane.

329
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:36,952
Speaker 0: It's just really short on This the tower that the crane is on.

330
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:38,520
Speaker 0: there's a hydraulic lift.

331
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:44,220
Speaker 0: The hydraulic lift basically lifts the crane up one sections worth.

332
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:53,260
Speaker 0: Then the crane goes and uses the actual crane that is working to lift up a new section and it slides in.

333
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:55,707
Speaker 0: Then people screw it, you know, they attach it.

334
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:01,559
Speaker 0: then the hydraulic lift lifts the crane itself up one more section And that's how it works.

335
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:05,990
Speaker 0: So this led to a more fascinating question.

336
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:10,130
Speaker 0: as soon as I saw this video I was like, aha I get it That's amazing incredible.

337
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,200
Speaker 0: It's everything I expected.

338
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:13,700
Speaker 0: How do they take that fucking shit apart?

339
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:24,847
Speaker 0: You think they would just do the same thing in reverse But actually no, so here's a video also second thing of day Dismantling the world's largest tower crane.

340
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:25,188
Speaker 0: I don't know.

341
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:28,097
Speaker 1: is that is that representative of how they take apart all cranes?

342
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:29,040
Speaker 1: or is that one special?

343
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,947
Speaker 0: It's specifically tower cranes Not any other kind of crane.

344
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,875
Speaker 0: There are many cranes that are not tower cranes.

345
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:36,960
Speaker 0: This is a tower crane.

346
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:39,035
Speaker 0: This is how they take that one apart.

347
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:51,592
Speaker 1: All right In the meta moment the book club book is the mechanical for Liebowitz, I'm hoping Scott will read it as I I actually Opened up yesterday to where I was bookmarked and then immediately closed.

348
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:52,134
Speaker 0: they went to bed.

349
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:53,177
Speaker 0: That's great.

350
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:54,320
Speaker 0: without reading any words.

351
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:56,512
Speaker 1: We got a bunch of videos on the internet.

352
00:20:56,593 --> 00:20:57,820
Speaker 1: not gonna dwell on all that stuff.

353
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:02,780
Speaker 1: We were running a contest to win two four day badges to PAX Prime.

354
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:08,820
Speaker 0: Those other people have had at least one person has received their tickets in the mail already.

355
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,391
Speaker 1: So the deadline is fast approaching.

356
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:18,940
Speaker 0: when Scott receives them I'll probably give like one grace day and then pick a winner randomly from amongst the people who have tweeted properly.

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,964
Speaker 1: We'll link to the rules.

358
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:23,520
Speaker 1: But basically you have to tweet promotional stuff about us and gig nights.

359
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,458
Speaker 0: Yes, at least one person is tweeted incorrectly neglecting the PAX hashtag.

360
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,844
Speaker 1: Oh You got it.

361
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:31,511
Speaker 1: You better check and make sure it wasn't you.

362
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:33,740
Speaker 0: you can still tweet again and get it, right?

363
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,524
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

364
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:36,920
Speaker 1: We're going to do a search to find all the correct entries.

365
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,272
Speaker 0: Yes, some people actually tweeted but did not link to any geek nights content.

366
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:42,014
Speaker 0: You're all.

367
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,599
Speaker 0: your tweet will also not count.

368
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,060
Speaker 0: Ah So make sure you tweeted correctly.

369
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,811
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you know, I just even it.

370
00:21:48,952 --> 00:21:50,080
Speaker 0: I know some of you people too.

371
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:53,888
Speaker 0: I feel bad missing your entry But I gotta do what I got to do.

372
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:56,918
Speaker 0: if I'll be fair follow the rules or else your entry doesn't count.

373
00:21:56,998 --> 00:21:59,046
Speaker 0: more than one Entry isn't gonna count either.

374
00:21:59,066 --> 00:21:59,869
Speaker 0: You're just gonna get one

375
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:16,520
Speaker 1: now granted if if packs Announced or at least told panel like panelists and presenters and speakers if they had a badge ready for them or not Then we wouldn't even bother buying badges and giving them away like this meaning two more people could have just bought batches.

376
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:18,709
Speaker 1: Yep, but this is the world we live in.

377
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:21,038
Speaker 1: I'm not risking not going to a PAX.

378
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:21,580
Speaker 0: That's right.

379
00:22:22,162 --> 00:22:30,733
Speaker 1: So if you're going to be a PAX either because you win these badges or because you're awesome noon Monday how to win every game Monday.

380
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,138
Speaker 0: Are you say packs for day?

381
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:33,463
Speaker 0: Oh my god I always forget.

382
00:22:33,524 --> 00:22:36,196
Speaker 1: packs is four days until like the week before and I go oh fuck.

383
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:41,340
Speaker 1: and for me Packs is six days because I'm also gonna be a pack Sunday full day of packs.

384

385
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:55,859
Speaker 0: This is I only hope permanent packs can come about within our lifetime If we all just move to one place.

386
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:57,594
Speaker 0: Permanent packs packs.

387
00:22:57,614 --> 00:23:00,931
Speaker 1: Yeah packs New York It would you know what it should be like.

388
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:04,360
Speaker 0: you should be like one of those Just kick everyone out of white planes and make it pack.

389
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:10,140
Speaker 1: It'll be like the Greek gentlemen societies that they have everywhere like the societies for like particular ethnic groups that moved to New York.

390
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:12,288
Speaker 1: We need a big one of those that's just packs.

391
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:15,120
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's like a certain neighborhood just becomes the nerd neighborhood.

392
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,310
Speaker 1: Yep, and then there's a bunch of those facilities like where we had the first burning con.

393
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:20,357
Speaker 0: Mmm, which neighborhood should we take over?

394
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:23,279
Speaker 1: Uh, Well, obviously the Upper West Side.

395
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,389
Speaker 1: So Yes, if you're gonna be a packs dev let me know.

396
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,120
Speaker 1: maybe we can hang out go to some panels together.

397
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:39,520
Speaker 1: If you're gonna be at the pack sky high charity prepacks, whatever event we're gonna be there you can play some games.

398
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,555
Speaker 1: I hope you have a VIP because I don't know if we can bring non VIPs in the VIP room which we just paid money for.

399
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,867
Speaker 0: and Otherwise, that's it spending too much money lately.

400
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,071
Speaker 0: Anyone wants to send me money.

401
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:52,480
Speaker 0: I have a second packs badge.

402
00:23:52,862 --> 00:24:02,340
Speaker 1: The good news, however, is that Part of the reason we're spending all this money is that we bought some equipment that's going to let us Continue to make content for the internet in great.

403
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:08,055
Speaker 0: I don't think there is any Equipment we could possibly get that we do not already have that we would need for anything at this point.

404
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:11,167
Speaker 1: having people to do The work is all we need.

405
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:13,599
Speaker 1: Yep, if someone else would video this shit.

406
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:21,853
Speaker 1: So yeah We're gonna try to use this shit at packs and at other places and expect a lot of video Content to be coming out of us in the near future.

407
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:24,140
Speaker 1: Mmm, so salad?

408
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:26,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we want to do food episode.

409
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:31,599
Speaker 0: We always seem to like the food but we needed something more specific than just food which had rim wanted to do.

410
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, what once called fire.

411
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:36,380
Speaker 0: so to be fair, that's a great episode.

412
00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:43,214
Speaker 0: So yeah salad is a kind of food I eat a lot and make a lot So I guess we can talk for 30 minutes about it pretty easily.

413
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,340
Speaker 0: I'm a big fan of salads.

414
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,967
Speaker 1: I my whole life as a kid.

415
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:50,765
Speaker 1: we would have a salad as a pre dish Or a side dish pretty much every meal.

416
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:51,487
Speaker 0: that is true.

417
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:56,120
Speaker 1: What sickens me is that most people I know that is not the case.

418
00:24:56,922 --> 00:25:00,393
Speaker 1: How what the fuck family did you grow up in a family that I don't know?

419
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:02,660
Speaker 0: ate McDonald's every dinner some fat family.

420
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:08,167
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't give it a McDonald's when I went to McDonald's as a kid unless it was breakfast I usually got the salad.

421
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:16,620
Speaker 0: when I was a kid McDonald's did not have salad and I stopped going to McDonald's when I was still in single digits of age and then I guess they had salad after that.

422
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:26,026
Speaker 0: I think the last time I went to McDonald's or Burger King like for reals was when they had Thundercats toys.

423
00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:26,909
Speaker 0: Oh, that's how long 80s.

424
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:28,774
Speaker 1: I went to a McDonald's.

425
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:30,600
Speaker 0: That's not to say I didn't eat fast food.

426
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,865
Speaker 0: I went to many in Arby's.

427
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:34,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, we tried to go to that one army.

428
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:36,838
Speaker 0: It's not that many years ago We went to Wendy's near at RIT.

429
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:41,411
Speaker 0: Yeah But I did not go to McDonald's because Wendy's was right next to putt-putt.

430
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:47,919
Speaker 1: that had the DDR machine and they had $1 Chicken nuggets, let me tell you when you're poor you have no money at all.

431
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:49,223
Speaker 0: Nuggets.

432
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:52,639
Speaker 1: five orders of $1 nuggets was a pretty good deal.

433
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:56,271
Speaker 1: So, uh, let's get right to the point.

434
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:57,900
Speaker 1: What's your favorite kind of salad Scott?

443
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,400
Speaker 0: And when I go there, I usually order one of two salads one that they've taken off the menu, but you can still order.

444
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:33,900
Speaker 0: You're one of those people which is the Fiesta and the other one which is they don't make the Fiesta anymore.

445
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:34,504
Speaker 0: Well, they do.

446
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:38,739
Speaker 0: you just say I want the Fiesta and they make it for you But it's not on the printed menu on the wall anymore.

447
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,795
Speaker 0: Every single person who works there knows what it is someday.

448
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:42,760
Speaker 1: That will not be true.

449
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,191
Speaker 1: Maybe I too have lost a kingdom.

450
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:49,195
Speaker 0: if there's someone there teach it to them and Pat You know play it forward like if you're all right.

451
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:54,620
Speaker 1: RIT kids I know a lot of you listen go to while Java Wally's on campus and try to order a chaplain.

452
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:56,599
Speaker 1: That is the ultimate test.

453
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:58,692
Speaker 0: The other one that they have there.

454
00:26:58,732 --> 00:27:00,020
Speaker 0: I really like is the South Beach.

455
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:07,585
Speaker 0: So the South Beach is like fruit and nuts and raisins and gorgonzola cheese and this, you know It's sort of that kind of salads.

456
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:11,660
Speaker 0: They're a summary and the Fiesta is basically like Chipotle in salad form.

457
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:20,133
Speaker 0: It's some like crispy fried chicken all chopped up with you know lettuce and Like sour cream.

458
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:20,780
Speaker 1: What are those salad?

459
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:22,845
Speaker 0: Little tortillas.

460
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:29,980
Speaker 0: It's basically just an enchilada tomato onion all kinds of cheese Some Tex-Mex dressing on there.

461
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:40,379
Speaker 1: I realized when I grew up as a kid There was a default salad because I lived in Michigan in the Midwest and in the Midwest it seems like the default salad is basically the chef salad.

462
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:58,149
Speaker 1: So cubed ham, maybe some cubed turkey Maybe some cubed salami some cubed Monterey Jack some cubed cheddar, maybe some cubed and like Colby sometimes iceberg lettuce onions Tons of ranch dressing and maybe bacon bits.

463
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:04,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was basically just a. it's almost like if you it's like Making cereal with croutons and instead of milk.

464
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,200
Speaker 1: It's so croutons instead of cereal ranch dressing instead of milk.

465
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:09,640
Speaker 1: That's basically what these salads were.

466
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,507
Speaker 0: So the chef salad and the Cobb salad are actually my least favorite Salad.

467
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:15,633
Speaker 1: I was saving that for the end.

468
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:20,291
Speaker 0: that is my least favorite Salads because the chef salad contains those cubed ham.

469
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:21,997
Speaker 1: Oh my god that cubed ham is so good.

470
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,620
Speaker 0: not a fan of Really any to be fair.

471
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:31,889
Speaker 1: I'll give you that because if you don't like cubed ham if you don't like like pink boiled ham I can understand why you wouldn't like a chef.

472
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:39,120
Speaker 1: the Cobb salad has the hard-boiled egg, which also not a fan Oh, but the hard-boiled egg Which is not a salad usually.

473
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:43,998
Speaker 0: No the time of the Cobb salad has the egg and the chef salad has the ham neither of which I'm a big fan of.

474
00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:47,620
Speaker 0: so I tend to avoid those in the elementary school cafeteria.

475
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,322
Speaker 1: You could order.

476
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:54,820
Speaker 1: usually they have two options for dinner or dinner for lunch and it was always like the bullshit food in cafeterias.

477
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:01,100
Speaker 1: That's awful like their chicken nuggets or the awful hamburger and then the other option was pretty much always the chef salad.

478
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:06,359
Speaker 1: So I ate chef salad like every goddamn day, and that's also what I made at home.

479
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,044
Speaker 1: Scott's poking me for some reason.

480
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:10,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just decided to do that cuz I can.

481
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,040
Speaker 1: yeah, okay poking me with the microphone boom.

482
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:20,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, the extra microphone boom, but we don't need anymore because we bought those countryman microphones.

483
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,067
Speaker 0: boom We're not gonna use this for the podcast.

484
00:29:22,147 --> 00:29:25,603
Speaker 1: No, but I don't need this third boom anymore I guess not.

485
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:27,489
Speaker 1: we're using those for video no longer.

486
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:29,335
Speaker 1: We'll just gotta sit there for like an hour while I like.

487
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:33,605
Speaker 0: position the stereo mics anyway More salad action.

488
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:34,990
Speaker 0: so making a salad salad.

489
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,668
Speaker 0: I usually make it home is very similar to the salad My parents would make it home.

490
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:40,460
Speaker 1: Oh, so garden salad or Caesar salad?

491
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's usually garden.

492
00:29:41,604 --> 00:29:44,115
Speaker 0: ish right cuz basically once I got to high school.

493
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:45,159
Speaker 0: They told me to make this out.

494
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:50,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what we my dad doesn't like cucumber, but we had cucumber anyway, and he just wouldn't get any.

495
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:57,200
Speaker 0: yeah Amazingly some lettuce usually romaine iceberg something like that, okay, so lame-o lettuce standard lettuce.

496
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,511
Speaker 0: Yeah, chop it up nicely tear it up.

497
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:01,098
Speaker 0: you with your hands actually not supposed to cut it.

498
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:05,183
Speaker 1: I learned that from From.

499
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:06,169
Speaker 1: oh my god.

500
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,619
Speaker 1: What sitcom did I learn that from?

501
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,704
Speaker 0: Anyway, go on Seinfeld.

502
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:11,030
Speaker 1: I don't know way before that.

503
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,411
Speaker 0: okay.

504
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,656
Speaker 0: You tear lettuce with your hands.

505
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:13,138
Speaker 0: You don't cut it.

506
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,473
Speaker 1: Carrot Charles in charge really that there's an episode about that.

507
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:19,997
Speaker 0: apparently that guy's supposed to be a dick.

508
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:20,358
Speaker 0: I've heard.

509
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,729
Speaker 1: uh I don't I can't comment on that.

510
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:24,800
Speaker 0: I've heard rumors that the Charles charge.

511
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,171
Speaker 0: I heard rumors that I was named Scott.

512
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:28,216
Speaker 1: right Scott Bayo.

513
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:28,839
Speaker 0: is that the guy's name?

514
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,151
Speaker 1: Anyway, I want Charles anyway charge of your salad.

515
00:30:36,511 --> 00:30:39,338
Speaker 1: so yeah in that episode basically carrot lettuce.

516
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:53,674
Speaker 1: in that episode Every time he walks into the room onion cucumber they're making a salad and someone's always there either cutting lettuce with scissors or With a knife and every time he comes and he's like ah you got a tear it why?

517
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:55,800
Speaker 1: otherwise it'll go brown why?

518
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:58,680
Speaker 1: You're just supposed to know that yeah, but why does it go brown?

519
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,202
Speaker 1: I don't know.

520
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:02,080
Speaker 1: and this happens like every time he comes in someone's fucking up the salad.

521
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,392
Speaker 0: There is a time when you're not supposed to tear a lettuce with your hands.

522
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:09,140
Speaker 0: You know and that is a wedge salad.

523
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:10,600
Speaker 1: I like wedge salad.

524
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,019
Speaker 0: I gotta use a big knife and make a big wedge and that lettuce and then you can make a wedge salad.

525
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,935
Speaker 1: oh In the modern era people seem to agree that tearing the salad is pointless.

526
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:19,879
Speaker 0: why?

527
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:22,999
Speaker 1: uh That it's all a myth.

528
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:26,516
Speaker 1: Okay I'm doing some research here.

529
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:29,850
Speaker 0: So basically I depend on the kind of lettuce.

530
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:30,893
Speaker 1: That's what I think it is.

531
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:32,679
Speaker 1: I take this guy did an experiment.

532
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:39,000
Speaker 1: So I tear green leaf lettuce and red leaf lettuce unless I'm making a chopped salad.

533
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:42,200
Speaker 1: I don't actually as much as I really like.

534
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:50,229
Speaker 0: If you're doing the thing that the salad places do where you just chop everything up like crazy before putting it in the bowl doesn't matter And it doesn't matter whether you tore it or chopped it.

535
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:55,459
Speaker 1: when you make a chopped salad you put it in a bowl and actually Toss it With the dressing.

536
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:59,220
Speaker 0: No, I usually just put the dressing on and use my fork to just turn it over.

537
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:00,920
Speaker 0: No, I don't have a bowl.

538
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:06,101
Speaker 0: It's like I got that dirty a whole extra bowl just to toss the salad in and then poor it's worth it Mmm.

539
00:32:06,302 --> 00:32:14,528
Speaker 1: It's kind of like when you fry rice like if you if you put that effort in to quote every single grain of rice with a It is so worth all five flavors to come out.

540
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:15,271
Speaker 0: It'll be so golden.

541
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:16,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'll shed a manly tear.

542
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:19,004
Speaker 1: Oh In real life.

543
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:23,780
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter how you divide the leaves as long as you don't apply dressing before storing for a prolonged period.

544
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:27,352
Speaker 1: Obviously the lettuce is browning on the ribs before it doesn't the edges.

545
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:29,920
Speaker 1: the difference between cut and torn is no longer important.

546
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:31,398
Speaker 1: Wait, no longer.

547
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:33,408
Speaker 1: When is this important?

548
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:34,776
Speaker 1: All right, you talk.

549
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:42,200
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read this See a typical salad I make lettuce tomato cucumber carrot peppers onions croutons.

550
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,565
Speaker 0: What kind of peppers dressing?

551
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:45,011
Speaker 0: Oh any kind I can get right?

552
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:48,724
Speaker 0: So sometimes the red ones sometimes the green ones Sometimes the yellow and the orange.

553
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:51,012
Speaker 1: We're not using like poblanos or jalapenos though.

554
00:32:51,675 --> 00:32:53,120
Speaker 0: No, I mean those are in the Fiesta.

555
00:32:54,905 --> 00:33:03,560
Speaker 0: That is more like I don't like one of those like taco salad using some kind of bell pepper whichever one looks good at the Store, maybe I'll buy a package of like the trace colores peppers.

556
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,048
Speaker 1: All right, this guy argues the opposite.

557
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:07,060
Speaker 1: tearing lettuce is always worth the effort.

558
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,882
Speaker 0: Okay, why?

559
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,611
Speaker 1: uh, it takes a reasonably similar amount of time and the different.

560
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:12,473
Speaker 1: but what?

561
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:14,798
Speaker 1: what if you were planning on eating a god?

562
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,564
Speaker 1: Damn it you people.

563
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:18,270
Speaker 1: This is too complicated.

564
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,117
Speaker 0: I got to call the Culinary Institute.

565
00:33:20,218 --> 00:33:20,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do.

566
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,187
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I got to see what they learn in their class.

567
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:23,929
Speaker 1: We should pull.

568
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,740
Speaker 0: we should pull multiple chefs and get their opinion.

569
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:32,380
Speaker 0: I was always told by Like nine out of ten dentists to prove of this toothpaste.

570
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:36,439
Speaker 0: How many chefs out of how many say you should tell the right Ma's and Ma's?

571
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,887
Speaker 1: Told me to tear it as did Charles in charge.

572
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:40,693
Speaker 1: the internet seems to think that it doesn't matter.

573
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:41,536
Speaker 1: Okay.

574
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:42,860
Speaker 0: Anyway, whatever.

575
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,630
Speaker 0: So yeah What do you think of lettuce in a bag?

576
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:46,670
Speaker 0: I?

577
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,999
Speaker 1: Used to buy that when I didn't have a lot of time to cook but fuck that now.

578
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:57,037
Speaker 1: See now I always get all fresh everything and prepare the salad entirely from scratch.

579
00:33:57,257 --> 00:34:03,860
Speaker 0: when I was growing up My mom had mad Tupperware including this green bowl a special green bowl that you could put a head of lettuce in.

580
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, guess what?

581
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:05,268
Speaker 1: We got one of those.

582
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:11,357
Speaker 0: now if you bought lettuce that comes in head shape We got one and if you put lettuce in that bowl, it stayed good for so fucking long.

583
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:11,980
Speaker 0: It was amazing.

584
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:14,998
Speaker 0: that's like this incredible green Tupperware bowl that they don't make anymore.

585
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:25,120
Speaker 0: and Because I didn't have that bowl and whenever I bought some kind of lettuce It went bad pretty quick even though iceberg lettuce for a dollar is the cheapest even romaine lettuce, right?

586
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,159
Speaker 0: It's like buying it's the cheapest way even in like a escarole or something.

587
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,480
Speaker 0: But and had the bowls lettuce went bad so fast.

588
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Speaker 0: Okay These people bought lettuce in a bag to avoid, you know.

589
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,300
Speaker 0: So I'd spend less money and use more lettuce and be more efficient.

590
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:43,713
Speaker 0: But when it once I got out of college, I went on eBay.

591
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,518
Speaker 0: I bought that motherfucking bowl.

592
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:48,969
Speaker 0: Sadly, I as my no more bag lettuce for me.

593
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,760
Speaker 1: I really like iceberg lettuce, but which is you know the head?

594
00:34:53,081 --> 00:35:01,711
Speaker 1: Yeah, unlike like green leaf lettuce, like I can't put in a bowl like that cuz it's long big Yep, and lately I've been getting Batavian lettuce was just like this monster.

595
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:02,273
Speaker 1: Mmm.

596
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:02,955
Speaker 1: It's good.

597
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:04,680
Speaker 0: You can put other non head lettuce.

598
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,716
Speaker 0: I mean there are lettuces that are sort of head like like the escarole is sort of like a. you know It's a different shape, but it's still a head.

599
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:12,419
Speaker 0: true You can put a cabbage in there.

600
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:16,000
Speaker 1: But the problem is I can feed the rabbits because we have to feed the rabbits fresh greens.

601
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,020
Speaker 1: So we've alternate from the parsley and cilantro and lettuces and all these things.

602
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:25,620
Speaker 1: Uh Rabbits can't eat iceberg lettuce because it's got too much cellulose and we'll give them gas and get basically a hundred percent cellulose.

603
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,033
Speaker 0: It might as well be celery in leaf form and as a kid.

604
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:35,997
Speaker 1: I always had this perception that Iceberg lettuce was like the bad lettuce like iceberg.

605
00:35:36,097 --> 00:35:36,720
Speaker 0: It's not a bad.

606
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,700
Speaker 1: Let's just a general that no not bad like taste bad like not as good for you as other lettuces.

607
00:35:41,861 --> 00:35:43,653
Speaker 0: It's just as good for you as other lettuces.

608
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:46,686
Speaker 0: That's actually debatable But it's a generic lettuce.

609
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:46,927
Speaker 0: right?

610
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:49,314
Speaker 1: iceberg lettuce is the lettuce that you use to make a salad.

611
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:53,687
Speaker 1: that's primarily consisting of cheese and Meat and croutons and dressing.

612
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:57,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, is it like bears the most weight and it has the most water going on Like.

613
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:00,616
Speaker 0: I was never much better for sandwiches and other lettuces.

614
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:01,300
Speaker 1: That is true.

615
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:04,120
Speaker 0: It is the same as the kind of sandwich sandwich though, right?

616
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,722
Speaker 0: Some what?

617
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:08,919
Speaker 0: sometimes you make a sandwich and you want those those lettuces that are just like leaves.

618
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:16,651
Speaker 0: You know like I do that you know, it feels like you're eating a tree Kind of sandwich chunk of romaine just across the entire sandwich.

619
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:23,194
Speaker 0: in that case see I like doing that flavor wise But often it creates this surface for things just slide off of.

620
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,266
Speaker 1: ah, you're stacking incorrectly You didn't?

621
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:32,283
Speaker 0: you never worked at the Bellas But lettuce at the bottom things drip into it and then the romaine has this chute down the middle and all this lettuce goes on Top.

622
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,049
Speaker 0: No, this goes.

623
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:35,388
Speaker 1: lettuce goes at the very top It goes in the bottom.

624
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:36,458
Speaker 1: lettuce goes on the top.

625
00:36:36,518 --> 00:36:36,700
Speaker 0: bottom.

626
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:36,881
Speaker 0: You.

627
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:42,100
Speaker 0: basically you make a salad on your on top of the bread and then you put the meat and cheese on top of that.

628
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,747
Speaker 1: You don't know shit about making sandwich.

629
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:44,389
Speaker 0: I do know shit.

630
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:45,594
Speaker 1: We gotta do Sean sandwiches.

631
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:50,011
Speaker 0: Okay next Thursday Thursday is no longer whatever night.

632
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:52,040
Speaker 0: It's no longer the lounge now food night.

633
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:54,065
Speaker 1: But here's the difference.

634
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:56,873
Speaker 1: if I use iceberg lettuce may have done sandwiches already.

635
00:36:57,114 --> 00:37:03,395
Speaker 1: I'm gonna put some creamy ass Dressing on oh for sure if I use because it's watery dressing.

636
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:06,938
Speaker 1: It's already so watery I would never put oil and vinegar on that.

637
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,069
Speaker 0: oil Just slide right off like a friggin slip and slide.

638
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:13,240
Speaker 1: oil and vinegar is if the individual lettuces had care.

639
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:19,624
Speaker 0: Yeah oil and vinegar has got to go on a salad where the lettuce can actually like absorb some of that maybe An iceberg.

640
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:21,132
Speaker 0: it just nothing sticks to that.

641
00:37:21,213 --> 00:37:24,680
Speaker 0: It just goes if you put oil and vinegar You're gonna get a pool of oil and vinegar at the bottom of the bowl.

642
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:25,198
Speaker 0: You won't eat.

643
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,625
Speaker 1: well oil and vinegar is got to be used.

644
00:37:26,665 --> 00:37:41,312
Speaker 1: if the salad is an appetizer or not the main meal and if the salad consists primarily of greens that are themselves high quality It's got to be a salad that would taste good with no dressing Yep, because then the oil and vinegar is just an enhancement to that.

645
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:42,716
Speaker 1: Otherwise, perfect salad.

646
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:43,037
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

647
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:56,120
Speaker 1: But if I'm making a you know big ol like rim is hungry and this salad is dinner then the salad actually consists mostly of meat and the lettuce is basically just A vehicle to make me feel a little less bad about eating a bowl of me.

648
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,960
Speaker 0: I actually almost never put meat on a salad.

649
00:37:59,422 --> 00:38:05,548
Speaker 0: The only time I get me in the salad is like if it's like, you know Make that myself.

650
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:06,960
Speaker 0: I'll only get that at places.

651
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:10,380
Speaker 1: I'll make that a lot usually for dinner like if the salad is dinner.

652
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,898
Speaker 0: But I should do that like if I make a steak.

653
00:38:12,261 --> 00:38:17,240
Speaker 0: I should just make two steaks and then instead of just usually I'll use the leftover to make a sandwich.

654
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:19,791
Speaker 0: I should cut the leftover up and make a salad.

655
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,880
Speaker 0: I just don't think to do that, but that's a good idea.

656
00:38:22,442 --> 00:38:27,300
Speaker 1: So I also put I always get a little bit of like arugula or cilantro and arugula is real good.

657
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,030
Speaker 1: And arugula is great, but don't make the mistake of thinking.

658
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,013
Speaker 1: Hey, I like arugula.

659
00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:32,820
Speaker 1: I'll make a small side salad.

660
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,863
Speaker 1: This is 100% arugula.

661
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:34,445
Speaker 1: Wrong.

662
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,308
Speaker 0: Bad news.

663
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:37,796
Speaker 0: Notice, you know, it's okay to use 100% iceberg 100% romaine.

664
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,738
Speaker 0: Those other kinds of lettuces usually got to be mixed in.

665
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, like dandelion greens.

666
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:48,420
Speaker 1: if you put more than one big ol green of dandelion in your salad that thing tastes like bitter shit.

667
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:50,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I don't eat it at all because it's nasty.

668
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:50,969
Speaker 0: It's not food either.

669
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:52,414
Speaker 1: I don't know what your problem is with dandelion greens.

670
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:52,855
Speaker 1: It's not food.

671
00:38:53,056 --> 00:38:55,651
Speaker 0: Dandelion greens are delicious But then you just said it was bitter shit.

672
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:56,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, which one is it?

673
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,320
Speaker 1: So are most of the kinds of green vegetables that you saute.

674
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't eat that shit or saute it first, right?

675
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:05,184
Speaker 0: Especially Kale spinach.

676
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:06,448
Speaker 1: don't eat raw kale.

677
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:07,371
Speaker 1: you motherfuckers.

678
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:09,820
Speaker 0: people be kale's like this huge trending motherfucker.

679
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:11,486
Speaker 0: That shit is poison.

680
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:12,794
Speaker 0: Yo, so is spinach.

681
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:16,351
Speaker 0: unless you cook it It's loaded with this acid called oxalic acid.

682
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:17,274
Speaker 1: Spinach is not as bad.

683
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:18,560
Speaker 0: spinach is actually worse.

684
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:22,738
Speaker 1: Well, because people don't eat as much of it, you know, you don't make a whole salad with nothing but spinach.

685
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:23,944
Speaker 0: obviously The point is it tastes great.

686
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:35,186
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna deny that Kale and even worse spinach in their raw forms contain a ton of oxalic acid Which is just straight-up bad for you.

687
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:38,698
Speaker 0: the same way that like trans fat is bad for you, right?

688
00:39:38,758 --> 00:39:39,360
Speaker 0: It's just bad.

689
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,194
Speaker 0: There's nothing good about eating that acid.

690
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:41,739
Speaker 0: It's just bad.

691
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:49,887
Speaker 0: So if you want to eat kale or spinach, you should either eat a very small quantity of it raw like, okay There's a couple spinach leaves in your salad.

692
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:50,489
Speaker 0: No problem.

693
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:52,196
Speaker 0: You won't die big deal, right?

694
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:52,657
Speaker 0: I've eaten.

695
00:39:52,678 --> 00:39:53,300
Speaker 0: I eat red meat.

696
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:54,174
Speaker 0: That's bad for you, too.

697
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,300
Speaker 0: But don't eat a big huge pile of kale.

698
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:01,675
Speaker 0: I see salad put at these salad places that are 100% kale raw not good.

699
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,164
Speaker 1: Those people always get the same thing.

700
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:07,915
Speaker 1: They order like a kale and quinoa blend as possible salad.

701
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:09,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate quinoa.

702
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:10,664
Speaker 1: It's quinoa.

703
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:11,848
Speaker 0: I think it depends.

704
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:12,350
Speaker 1: You know what?

705
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:12,872
Speaker 1: You know what?

706
00:40:13,173 --> 00:40:13,515
Speaker 1: You know what?

707
00:40:13,535 --> 00:40:16,227
Speaker 1: I'm gonna call it for non quinoa Because I don't care.

708
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:16,891
Speaker 0: I don't care.

709
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:17,635
Speaker 0: It's bad.

710
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:18,500
Speaker 0: It doesn't taste good.

711
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:18,942
Speaker 1: It's.

712
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:21,714
Speaker 1: it's the kind of thing that people eat out of obligate.

713
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:23,220
Speaker 0: They like they like liking it.

714
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:26,960
Speaker 1: I should eat something healthy and I've noticed that with salads to a lot of people.

715
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:36,920
Speaker 1: I believe that this is healthy despite any evidence suggesting so I think a lot of people Would prefer to eat a salad comprised and mostly of ranch dressing and croutons.

716
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:40,780
Speaker 0: It's called a Caesar salad, but except that Caesar dressing.

717
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:52,200
Speaker 1: But they will eat oil and vinegar on a bland salad Because they they perceive that it's better for them or they don't want to be seen as the person eating the ridiculously fatty salad.

718
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:54,269
Speaker 0: I think they just believe it's better for them.

719
00:40:54,671 --> 00:41:00,271
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time if you don't like marketing works don't get that on your salad.

720
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,615
Speaker 1: if you like ranch dressing go for it.

721
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:02,999
Speaker 1: unless you're fat then don't.

722
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,105
Speaker 0: If you're fat, no get it.

723
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:05,506
Speaker 0: It's these.

724
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,193
Speaker 0: you're eating a salad and not McDonald's.

725
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:10,687
Speaker 1: I could construct a salad That's way worse for you than any hamburger.

726
00:41:10,727 --> 00:41:11,009
Speaker 0: Mr.

727
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:11,993
Speaker 0: Meat in every salad.

728
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:12,997
Speaker 0: You're putting a hamburger in your salad.

729
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,965
Speaker 0: That's where I grew up in the Midwest.

730
00:41:15,126 --> 00:41:15,467
Speaker 0: Yeah.

731
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:18,379
Speaker 0: No, my salads rarely contain meat.

732
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,560
Speaker 1: Actually, usually I'll do a lot of cheese and nuts and not meat because I've been cutting a lot of meat.

733
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,813
Speaker 0: I know it's also rarely contain cheese.

734
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,464
Speaker 1: Uh It's very rare.

735
00:41:28,484 --> 00:41:32,300
Speaker 1: I will not put cheese in my salad unless the salad is just an appetizer.

736
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,900
Speaker 1: Not even not an appetizer.

737
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:34,658
Speaker 0: I do enjoy cheese.

738
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:41,548
Speaker 0: So if it's just a side dish like I have the partition plate like when you go to a diner and there's like like Cheddar and whatever in the salad.

739
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:42,171
Speaker 0: That's real good.

740
00:41:42,191 --> 00:41:44,020
Speaker 0: I love that shit a cubed or shredded.

741
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:48,380
Speaker 0: I like the shredded because then you can sort of mix it up a lot more especially with a carrot shredded.

742
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:50,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

743
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,464
Speaker 1: I've noticed Emily doesn't like the same kind of salad I do like.

744
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:54,520
Speaker 1: I make really over-the-top salads.

745
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,393
Speaker 1: But the problem is I think I like croutons and sunflowers way more.

746
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,637
Speaker 0: you like croutons, huh?

747
00:41:59,657 --> 00:42:00,419
Speaker 0: You don't say yeah.

748
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,327
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, they're basically advanced crackers.

749
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:04,959
Speaker 0: I also like root does but only in salad.

750
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:05,240
Speaker 1: why?

751
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,951
Speaker 1: Why arbitrarily limit yourself join me?

752
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:14,511
Speaker 1: It's not an arbitrary limit It is the very definition of an arbitrary.

753
00:42:14,551 --> 00:42:17,520
Speaker 0: I just eat ketchup then it tastes great because that's the condiment.

754
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:18,505
Speaker 0: So are croutons.

755
00:42:18,525 --> 00:42:19,630
Speaker 0: They're a salad condiment.

756
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:21,640
Speaker 1: Uh, no, they're not because you can eat them on their own.

757
00:42:22,601 --> 00:42:24,248
Speaker 0: You you can eat ketchup on its own.

758
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:25,131
Speaker 1: You shouldn't.

759
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:27,280
Speaker 0: you shouldn't eat croutons on their own either.

760
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:31,660
Speaker 1: What about if you crumble up crackers into your salad suddenly you're not allowed to eat crack?

761
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:33,432
Speaker 0: That's only because you didn't have croutons.

762
00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:33,996
Speaker 0: cuz you suck.

763
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:37,842
Speaker 1: That is true Don't?

764
00:42:37,882 --> 00:42:41,460
Speaker 1: every times in my life when I was a kid I would like make a salad like in high school.

765
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,560
Speaker 1: I can come home didn't have any fucking crew time, but I'd make the salad first and I assume we have croutons.

766
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:51,606
Speaker 1: I reach in there's no croutons and you assume then I'm like going through the whole house looking for like anything crunchy to put in that salad.

767
00:42:51,626 --> 00:42:52,090
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

768
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:57,117
Speaker 1: I Really actually like the crunchily onions, but I never keep them around.

769
00:42:57,379 --> 00:43:01,240
Speaker 1: so Don't think we should really talk about.

770
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:05,412
Speaker 0: I was just thinking about those two seconds ago.

771
00:43:05,432 --> 00:43:06,134
Speaker 1: I love those things.

772
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:07,317
Speaker 0: gonna buy some on the way home.

773
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:08,060
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

774
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:10,500
Speaker 0: So I don't need hot dogs for dinner.

775
00:43:10,661 --> 00:43:15,719
Speaker 1: And I feel like we should not talk about the other branch of salads of potato salads.

776
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,100
Speaker 1: in the light.

777
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,469
Speaker 1: That's a separate show mean potato salad chicken salad.

778
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,200
Speaker 0: The other thing is I'm not really into a lot of those.

779
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:35,802
Speaker 1: I am increasingly into them and I've always always like potato salad because that goes if you go to a garden party in the Midwest plus someone's bringing a ranch dressing heavy chef salad and the same person usually brings Potatoes.

780
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:44,386
Speaker 0: the reason I don't like a lot of those is because most of them tend to just be a bunch of stuff all mixed up Basically drowned in mayonnaise.

781
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:46,373
Speaker 0: and I'm yeah, not big on man.

782
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:48,240
Speaker 0: I'm big on mayonnaise pasta salad.

783
00:43:48,401 --> 00:43:50,529
Speaker 0: I love pasta not big on pasta salad.

784
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,399
Speaker 1: I just made a pesto pasta salad with pine nuts the other day.

785
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:54,805
Speaker 0: Oh, I still could be good.

786
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:55,689
Speaker 0: It's not like a boy.

787
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:56,332
Speaker 0: It's not mayonnaise.

788
00:43:56,352 --> 00:43:58,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, make a pesto pasta salad sometime.

789
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,152
Speaker 0: That could be good right fucking amazing.

790
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:00,715
Speaker 0: It was great.

791
00:44:00,756 --> 00:44:01,460
Speaker 1: Here's the secret.

792
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,270
Speaker 1: But however much butter you think you're gonna use when you're less more.

793
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, just butter it up.

794
00:44:06,297 --> 00:44:07,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's great I don't like.

795
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:09,120
Speaker 0: but sometimes you get that pasta salad.

796
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,436
Speaker 0: It's like pasta and some vegetables and some potato bits all drowned in mayonnaise and the pot it's cold.

797
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:16,485
Speaker 0: now because they cook the pasta It's supposed to be cold.

798
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:18,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't not a big into that.

799
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:22,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, right I want the pasta at least be warm and drowned in something.

800
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,933
Speaker 0: That's not mayonnaise.

801
00:44:24,114 --> 00:44:25,257
Speaker 1: Sometimes I'll live dangerously.

802
00:44:25,297 --> 00:44:29,364
Speaker 1: instead of using hard-boiled eggs I'll use deviled eggs Not big into any.

803
00:44:29,745 --> 00:44:30,970
Speaker 1: I don't know what's up with you and eggs.

804
00:44:31,612 --> 00:44:32,235
Speaker 0: I like eggs.

805
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,640
Speaker 0: I just don't like weird.

806
00:44:34,142 --> 00:44:34,866
Speaker 1: So tomatoes.

807
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:36,493
Speaker 1: what tomato do you use?

808
00:44:36,513 --> 00:44:38,020
Speaker 0: Oh for a salad?

809
00:44:38,104 --> 00:44:42,655
Speaker 1: Yeah Depends on the salad because I used to not know better when I was young.

810
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:43,980
Speaker 1: and I just get the beefsteak tomatoes.

811
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,763
Speaker 1: No, what's that?

812
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,267
Speaker 0: That's for sandwiches lately.

813
00:44:46,288 --> 00:44:50,100
Speaker 1: I only I pretty much only use Zima's or like heirloom cherry tomatoes.

814
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,608
Speaker 0: Okay, so sometimes I'll you.

815
00:44:52,728 --> 00:44:55,317
Speaker 0: obviously if you have a tomato you grew yourself like a cherry tomato.

816
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:56,260
Speaker 0: That's a great ago.

817
00:44:56,721 --> 00:44:59,774
Speaker 0: Okay, any tomato you grew yourself just tastes better than any tomato.

818
00:44:59,794 --> 00:45:00,799
Speaker 0: you combine this for sure, right?

819
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:06,280
Speaker 0: There is a brand of tomato they have at the store that's expensive that actually tastes almost as good as backyard tomato.

820
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,269
Speaker 0: So you can buy that and just shell out the money.

821
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:08,731
Speaker 0: That's also.

822
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:10,820
Speaker 1: if you're doing that just buy any tomatoes.

823
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,306
Speaker 0: I think it's like a cherry tomato or a grape tomato or something like that but by the ones that are not red.

824
00:45:15,627 --> 00:45:24,478
Speaker 1: because though basically from what I've read read the The things that make tomatoes taste good and the same and the jeans that make tomatoes red.

825
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,400
Speaker 1: Nah, there's a there's like a negative alignment there.

826
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:31,316
Speaker 1: So if you breed tomatoes to look good, they don't taste good.

827
00:45:31,336 --> 00:45:41,657
Speaker 0: Yep Also, you know a plum tomatoes not bad because you can sort of cut it up nicely and the tomatoes on the vine are usually More expensive, but there's usually reason for that.

828
00:45:42,765 --> 00:45:43,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, then the grocery store.

829
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:50,096
Speaker 0: I found they're not as good and also those bends of the grocery store Like one grocery store near me has so many different kinds of tomatoes and they are all horrible.

830
00:45:50,157 --> 00:45:52,044
Speaker 0: and the other store You know has like.

831
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:56,200
Speaker 0: the thing is you tend to lean towards the tomatoes that are just sort of out in the open.

832
00:45:56,802 --> 00:45:59,592
Speaker 0: They always had the prepackaged ones and they're always sort of suspicious.

833
00:45:59,913 --> 00:46:01,660
Speaker 0: but actually those are usually really good.

834
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,746
Speaker 0: They just cost a lot more.

835
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:12,039
Speaker 1: I found if I'm making like a garden salad What I'll usually do is take moderately sized like holding my hand tomatoes and I'll cut them into like fifths wedges.

836
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:13,873
Speaker 1: I'll put the wedges just in the salad.

837
00:46:13,893 --> 00:46:14,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what you gotta do wedges.

838
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:17,893
Speaker 0: I also cut the wedges in half to make like mini pyramids.

839
00:46:18,034 --> 00:46:20,866
Speaker 1: No because I found if I do that Usually it's too mushy and watery.

840
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:23,960
Speaker 0: Well, that's not you got to get a tomato that has more structure to it.

841
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,333
Speaker 0: Not one that's all full of water, but usually the watery ones taste better.

842
00:46:27,513 --> 00:46:29,220
Speaker 0: No, the structurally ones taste better.

843
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,652
Speaker 1: But if I'm making a child, I like tomato.

844
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:31,600
Speaker 0: I like tomato flesh.

845
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:33,732
Speaker 0: I don't really like tomato water and seeds.

846
00:46:33,913 --> 00:46:43,519
Speaker 1: if I'm doing the chop toss salad What I'll do is not let this might seem like overkill, but it's worth it I'll get cherry tomatoes or the Zima tomatoes like the little ones the orange ones and I'll cut them all in half.

847
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,034
Speaker 1: That's a good idea because then you get the benefit of both worlds.

848
00:46:47,355 --> 00:46:53,700
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah Occasionally, I'll do celery but I find that celery doesn't add a lot to the salad.

849
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,786
Speaker 0: No, I don't buy celery.

850
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:57,160
Speaker 0: too often you all it's mostly cuz you have to buy so much celery.

851
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,662
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I never.

852
00:46:57,702 --> 00:46:59,631
Speaker 1: I use like two stalks of it and then the rest gets.

853
00:46:59,672 --> 00:47:02,529
Speaker 0: I'll have to just eat celery straight up to Finish it all I know.

854
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,860
Speaker 1: and I don't like eating celery straight up.

855
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:11,583
Speaker 0: I like it in like soup carrot pro tip instead of buying like the you know carrots in a bag or Baby care.

856
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:15,400
Speaker 1: why baby carrots are not baby carrots as regular carrots cut down to look like baby care.

857
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,820
Speaker 0: We know that God you all didn't I were you go to the actual vegetable section.

858
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,625
Speaker 0: You can buy the big motherfucking.

859
00:47:21,665 --> 00:47:22,247
Speaker 0: care careful.

860
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:22,668
Speaker 1: Careful.

861
00:47:22,728 --> 00:47:27,160
Speaker 1: The ain't the larger a carrot is the inside is usually kind of bitter.

862
00:47:27,321 --> 00:47:27,803
Speaker 0: I like that.

863
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:28,726
Speaker 0: I like the bigger.

864
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:32,501
Speaker 0: to me at least the big carrot tastes way better than any of the carrots They have.

865
00:47:33,064 --> 00:47:34,629
Speaker 1: I like to get the baby carrot.

866
00:47:34,649 --> 00:47:35,733
Speaker 1: That's actually a baby.

867
00:47:35,793 --> 00:47:37,580
Speaker 0: can I usually buy two big carrots?

868
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,745
Speaker 0: And I'll use one for salad.

869
00:47:38,765 --> 00:47:39,648
Speaker 0: just eat the other one.

870
00:47:39,668 --> 00:47:42,500
Speaker 1: Well, if I get a big carrot, I shred it into the salad.

871
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:47,939
Speaker 0: No, I just instead of cutting it I cut the carrot and even though it goes from small to big so it's hard to cut evenly.

872
00:47:47,979 --> 00:47:52,460
Speaker 0: now Technique where you rotate the carrot so all your carrot bits are equally sized.

873
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:54,420
Speaker 0: As long as do it right or what?

874
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:02,875
Speaker 1: I'll do is I'll get the moderately to bigger sized carrots And if I don't even I don't want to shred it What I can do is I can chop it pretty fine or I'll slice it is usually pretty good.

875
00:48:03,015 --> 00:48:04,561
Speaker 1: or if I really want to Go nuts.

876
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:09,139
Speaker 1: I'll take that carrot and put it on the mandolin and just make like nice thin long carrot strip

877
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,653
Speaker 0: something else You can do just take your peeler peel the carrot

878
00:48:11,794 --> 00:48:12,619
Speaker 1: and then keep peeling it

879
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,753
Speaker 0: And then once it's peeled go over to the salad bowl and peel peel peel.

880
00:48:16,773 --> 00:48:18,237
Speaker 0: Yeah Julianne.

881
00:48:18,518 --> 00:48:20,871
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I'm big fan of the carrots.

882
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:21,960
Speaker 1: I'll put those in almost everything.

883
00:48:22,342 --> 00:48:25,195
Speaker 1: I'm a big fan of the nuts to like sunflower and walnuts.

884
00:48:25,376 --> 00:48:26,199
Speaker 0: walnut is good.

885
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,029
Speaker 1: Sunflower seed maybe depends on the salad again.

886
00:48:30,249 --> 00:48:32,135
Speaker 0: Walnut is really like the ultimate salad nut.

887
00:48:32,155 --> 00:48:33,700
Speaker 0: It's also one of the best nuts period.

888
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:34,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

889
00:48:34,305 --> 00:48:35,800
Speaker 1: I just got new walnuts for salad.

890
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,325
Speaker 0: like you don't put a peanut in a salad.

891
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:42,060
Speaker 1: my thing lately I haven't especially when it's like cooler out is I like to make a?

892
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:45,039
Speaker 1: That's like a lot of different kinds of greens.

893
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:52,759
Speaker 1: Maybe no tomatoes at all really finely chopped peppers goat cheese oil and vinegar.

894
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:59,300
Speaker 0: The thing with that kind of salad is there's something psychological about having a lot of different colors in the salad.

895
00:48:59,441 --> 00:48:59,865
Speaker 0: I don't like.

896
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:04,829
Speaker 1: that's why I put ready a red Decio in the salad even though it doesn't add a lot of flavor.

897
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:11,015
Speaker 0: even if the salad as is amazing if it's like all green It's sort of like I can't.

898
00:49:11,096 --> 00:49:11,982
Speaker 0: it's hard to eat I like.

899
00:49:12,002 --> 00:49:19,780
Speaker 1: that's why I gotta eat the carrot the tomato, you know peppers that are different color I'm telling you get to get a radicchio and just cut a little bit of it into every salad.

900
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:20,683
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

901
00:49:20,703 --> 00:49:21,085
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

902
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:23,413
Speaker 1: I just went to Wikipedia and the fourth heading here is toxicity.

903
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:31,807
Speaker 0: Uh So don't eat right, that's that's if you use chicory in Coffee, we know the chicory is poison.

904
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:32,731
Speaker 1: I like chicory though.

905
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:33,695
Speaker 1: Okay.

906
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,526
Speaker 1: Yeah Blah-blah chicory farms, whatever.

907

Speaker 1: Yeah.

908
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:38,929
Speaker 1: Riccio is good in salads.

909
00:49:39,631 --> 00:49:39,752
Speaker 0: Mmm.

910
00:49:40,373 --> 00:49:42,980
Speaker 1: It's a little bitter but not as bitter as like dandelions.

911
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,007
Speaker 1: Alright, I kind of wanna make a salad now.

912
00:49:46,268 --> 00:49:46,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm hungry.

913
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,394

Speaker 0: Yeah.

916
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,245
Speaker 1: So, uh, I think if I had to pick a salad though That's my favorite as much.

917
00:49:56,265 --> 00:50:01,700
Speaker 1: I like as much as I appreciate and really enjoy the simple artistic salad.

918
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:10,939
Speaker 1: That's mostly the vegetables themselves with the right amount of oil and the right amount of the right kind of vinegar Maybe a little bit of lemon just sort of squeezed over it.

919
00:50:12,003 --> 00:50:16,640
Speaker 1: The salads that I enjoy the most are the ones that are just a big old fucking cob salad.

920
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,987
Speaker 1: That's mostly meat like.

921
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,200
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna pretend that it's not my favorite kind of salad.
