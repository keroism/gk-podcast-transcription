1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,080
Speaker 1: 

2
00:00:08,923 --> 00:00:10,388
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, March 31st, 2022.

3
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:10,670
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:14,536
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,263
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:24,020
Speaker 0: We are back from a long, unplanned hiatus to talk about James Bond, the mostly fictional spy.

7
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:26,700
Speaker 1: Mostly?

8
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:30,978
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:41,520
Speaker 0: So, yeah, we had a longer hiatus than we've really ever had on Geek Nights, except in extremely rare circumstances in these, what, 16-plus years.

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,130
Speaker 0: Do a bunch of random stuff, you know, like Friends came over.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,720
Speaker 0: We had some work stuff.

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,859
Speaker 0: Eventually, like, Scott had a hockey game, and then I had to go to London on a business trip, but we're finally back.

13
00:00:54,061 --> 00:01:08,700
Speaker 1: We might have actually been able to get in a few shows there, but nobody realized that at some point in history, I don't remember exactly when, the Geek Nights, Monday, Wednesday, Tuesday, Thursday offset was offset.

14
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:18,080
Speaker 0: I actually know the date it happened, because I had filled my work calendar with permanent recurring meetings to make sure no one ever tried to schedule me.

15
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:21,780
Speaker 1: I could scroll back on the calendar and figure out exactly when it was.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,344
Speaker 1: But we waited.

17
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:24,360
Speaker 0: I was curious if anyone would notice.

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:33,020
Speaker 1: Nobody ever noticed, but yeah, this should have been a Monday, Wednesday week if we had never fucked up, but we fucked up once, and it was now a Tuesday, Thursday week.

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,140
Speaker 1: So, if we hadn't made that one fuck up, maybe the break of Geek Nights episodes would have been shorter.

20
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:45,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe the whole reason we've never had long hiatus was because of the previous, original Geek Nights schedule.

21
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,599
Speaker 0: It just lined up with our lives, like the ebb and flow of wanting to see people and do things.

22
00:01:51,781 --> 00:02:00,740
Speaker 1: But yeah, a whole bunch of stuff happened on Geek Nights days, and since it's not our job, and we don't really care if we miss a show, no one's paying us to do this, we're not obligated.

23
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,419
Speaker 1: We just, and we don't have a lot of ideas, you know, okay, let's skip, fine, okay.

24
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:13,480
Speaker 1: But that doesn't mean we're dead, it just seems, you know, obviously we're not dead, we're here.

25
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,102
Speaker 0: Yep.

26
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,874
Speaker 0: Speaking of which, so in the news, guess who had COVID?

27
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,640
Speaker 0: That's why we didn't do a show on Tuesday.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:28,040
Speaker 0: I tested positive within hours of, well, basically within about 12 hours of landing back in the US after a week long trip in the UK.

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,900
Speaker 0: I am, as of now, basically completely recovered, but I'm still gonna isolate for another two weeks.

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:47,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the two things I gotta say about that is, number one, man, it must suck to spend, like, so many years of your life hiding inside only to go outside once and immediately get, it's like-

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,598
Speaker 0: Yep, I go out for the, like, alright, I'm gonna do this business trip, I'll wear a mask, like, the whole damn time.

32
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:56,880
Speaker 0: Yep, the slightest misstep, it immediately gets me, it immediately gets Emily.

33
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,260
Speaker 0: It's

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:19,120
Speaker 1: like, imagine going into the woods and you've got this manual that's, like, how to not get eaten by a bear, and you got your, you know, bear repellent, and you got, you know, all kinds of, you got every bear precaution in the universe, and you're out in the woods for years, never ever ever getting in trouble with a bear, and you let your guard down for, like, a second, and a bear eats you.

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,443
Speaker 0: Well, you know, that's how my bike got stolen in Beacon.

36
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:34,593
Speaker 0: You know, I used to bike, we used to bike to the train station in the morning, because parking spaces there were hella expensive, and one day, I forgot my bike lock, like, I had it somewhere else for some reason, and I thought, what are the odds?

37
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:38,877
Speaker 0: I kind of just jammed my bike into the pile of all the other bikes, bike was stolen that day.

38
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,880
Speaker 0: Granted, that was the bike I stole back.

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:58,175
Speaker 0: But, yeah, thankfully, because I had two vaccines and a booster, honestly, it felt like a really bad cold, but not even the worst cold I'd ever had, and 36 hours later, like, I'm feeling good enough to do a Geek Nights.

40
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:02,900
Speaker 0: Don't know if I'd feel like going, like, doing eight hours of work, but I can do an hour of podcasting.

41
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,455
Speaker 1: The other thing I gotta say is that you only got this because your work made you go to London.

42
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,360
Speaker 1: You wouldn't have been going to London if your work didn't make you go.

43
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,400
Speaker 1: I

44
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:42,140
Speaker 0: don't know, it is clear that if I had kept my previous levels of, like, isolation to the point that I was even avoiding things people we know were doing, like, where everyone has different levels, I probably could have kept avoiding it, but my worry is, going to the UK showed me something that, I guess, because I've been so careful and lived in New York City and, like, haven't really left New York City that much, like, we went way upstate to ski in the winter, and, yeah, like, I expected people to not give a shit about COVID, like, up in this rural area, but New York City, people are still treating it pretty carefully.

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,779
Speaker 1: Not as much now.

46
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,381
Speaker 0: Yeah, but still more so.

47
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:59,840
Speaker 0: When I got to the UK, I gotta tell you, so I land, come out of the airport, go to my hotel, every bar, and it's, like, morning, every restaurant, every bar all day, completely packed with maskless people, shoulder to shoulder.

48
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,440
Speaker 0: London was more crowded indoors and, like, more filled with spittle than I have ever seen it pre-COVID.

49
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,807
Speaker 0: It's like nobody, no one was wearing, not one person was wearing a mask.

50
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:19,496
Speaker 0: Even in New York, I still see the occasional person wearing a mask outside, and the majority of people wearing masks indoors.

51
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,879
Speaker 0: Our building still requires you to have a mask on to come in.

52
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:29,140
Speaker 1: So, what I gotta say to that is, since your work made you go, is this a workers' comp situation or what?

53
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,822
Speaker 0: It could be.

54
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:31,851
Speaker 0: I could think about exploring that.

55
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,680
Speaker 0: I have negative PCR.

56
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,611
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be a large claim, right?

57
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:37,040
Speaker 1: It would probably just be a small settlement.

58
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Speaker 0: Well, 'cause the problem is the damage to me that I can prove correctly.

59
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,219
Speaker 0: Very small.

60
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:43,490
Speaker 1: Very small.

61
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:44,079
Speaker 1: Not zero.

62
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:51,434
Speaker 0: But I do have a negative PCR test from every other day on the entire trip and a negative rapid test every day.

63
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:54,360
Speaker 0: I definitely caught it on the trip, guaranteed.

64
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:56,090
Speaker 1: Yeah.

65
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,736
Speaker 1: Well, you know.

66
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:57,936
Speaker 0: Yep.

67
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,738
Speaker 1: I'm the kind of person who would, like, you know, try to do the workers' comp just for the principle of the thing, like, you know.

68
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:06,620
Speaker 0: Yep.

69
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:24,140
Speaker 1: And also, you know, there's a lot of reports, like, hey, that even if you get, you know, I don't know how true all these things are, but I've seen a lot of comments and studies that are like, you know, hey, you got a COVID, but, you know, and you got over it and you feel fine, but actually, you know, it messed with your brain or it messed with you in some other way, you know, something like that.

70
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:24,701
Speaker 0: Yep.

71
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:31,335
Speaker 0: Well, even beyond that, so apparently now PCR tests basically won't work on me for 90 days is the line.

72
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,900
Speaker 0: Like, they'll just show positive even though I'm not anymore.

73
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,325
Speaker 0: So I am now exempt from being tested if I go anywhere.

74
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:44,233
Speaker 0: All I have to do is sign a thing saying I've had COVID confirmed and nobody gives a shit.

75
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:48,520
Speaker 0: I don't have to do any testing anywhere, which is interesting.

76
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:54,358
Speaker 0: But also, my immunity theoretically also only lasts 90 days.

77
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,162
Speaker 1: Yeah.

78
00:06:56,182 --> 00:07:00,600
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, they're letting people into, you know, that square garden without vaccine.

79
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,047
Speaker 0: I mean, the last hockey game I went to with you, you and I were wearing masks.

80
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:08,514
Speaker 0: That kid sitting to the front left of us was wearing a mask.

81
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:12,000
Speaker 0: And I think one other person was wearing a mask on the other side of the arena.

82
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,097
Speaker 1: There are still some people, but it's like the majority are not and they're not checking for vaccination anymore.

83
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:17,939
Speaker 1: They're just like, fuck it.

84
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,400
Speaker 0: Yep.

85
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:23,807
Speaker 0: So my worry is my real fear is that it's unavoidable.

86
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,310
Speaker 0: And that means that we have a society of just failed.

87
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,596
Speaker 1: because while I mean, we knew it was going to become endemic at some point.

88
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:35,040
Speaker 1: But is is this endemic or is this still a pandemic?

89
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,182
Speaker 1: I don't know how to tell.

90
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:49,920
Speaker 0: Even if like masking and other things that started to fall away, I feel like the thing we as a society, society should have doubled down on more than anything else are the vaccine mandates requiring the vaccine to go places because that is the big line between.

91
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,781
Speaker 1: I think we should.

92
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:51,983
Speaker 1: I still think you should hold.

93
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:53,646
Speaker 1: I'm not even joking about this.

94
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,669
Speaker 1: I think you should hold people down and jab them.

95
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,290
Speaker 1: Right.

96
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:57,352
Speaker 1: Too bad.

97
00:07:57,673 --> 00:07:58,855
Speaker 1: Unless unless you do.

98
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:02,140
Speaker 1: Obviously, the true medical exemptions, obviously.

99
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:09,816
Speaker 1: But the you know, the nut job who just is a denier, hold them down and jab them.

100
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,400
Speaker 1: I got no problems with that whatsoever.

101
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,506
Speaker 0: There is the the fear of the slippery slope of bodily autonomy.

102
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:20,537
Speaker 0: That's why the compromise usually is we won't force it on you, but you are now denied access to all public places.

103
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:22,340
Speaker 1: You're basically under house arrest.

104
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,903
Speaker 1: You know, we could talk about slippery slopes again.

105
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:26,223
Speaker 1: Right.

106
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:32,351
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, there's a constant thing in our society where it's like because of some principle.

107
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:32,811
Speaker 1: Right.

108
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,275
Speaker 1: It's like we don't want to go down a slippery slope.

109
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:39,539
Speaker 1: But it's like, OK, you're afraid of the next step on the slope, but you're OK with the first step.

110
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,784
Speaker 1: It's like, well, yeah, but I don't want to do the first step because I'm afraid of the second one.

111
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:45,205
Speaker 0: Just don't go down the second step.

112
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:46,946
Speaker 1: Just don't go down the fucking second step.

113
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:47,467
Speaker 1: Right.

114
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:48,087
Speaker 1: It's like.

115
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:52,371
Speaker 0: what if the anti-fascists start attacking people who aren't Nazis?

116
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:53,672
Speaker 0: Like it's in our name.

117
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:54,673
Speaker 0: That's that's like.

118
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:57,996
Speaker 0: the only thing anti-fascists are after is the fascists.

119
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:01,719
Speaker 0: If the fascists go away, they don't go after someone else.

120
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:02,600
Speaker 0: They go home.

121
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:11,749
Speaker 1: The point is society as a whole would be better if we would, you know, go down slippery slopes and just not slip on them.

122
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:12,910
Speaker 0: Right.

123
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:14,812
Speaker 1: Right.

124
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:16,614
Speaker 1: That there's good stuff down the slope.

125
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:17,635
Speaker 1: Just a little ways.

126
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:19,257
Speaker 1: Go down and grab it and come back up.

127
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,898
Speaker 1: Don't fuck up and fall down.

128
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:21,559
Speaker 1: Yeah.

129
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,420
Speaker 1: How hard is that?

130
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:32,340
Speaker 0: But the vaccine mandate seemed to be just the most ridiculous thing to go away, considering that that's the last major measure we have that society will tolerate.

131
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,785
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like, you know, I'm not an expert.

132
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,086
Speaker 1: Right.

133
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,012
Speaker 1: But it definitely should have been the last.

134
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:40,094
Speaker 1: That's the easiest thing.

135
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:41,056
Speaker 1: Right.

136
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,120
Speaker 1: Anyway.

137
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,703
Speaker 0: So, yeah, don't go out and get it.

138
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:50,029
Speaker 0: Obviously, like if you haven't gotten it yet, I highly advise you to try to keep avoiding it.

139
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:59,200
Speaker 0: But if you do get it, I guess for me personally, it was not as bad as I had feared.

140
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,742
Speaker 0: Mostly because I was vaccinated.

141
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:03,865
Speaker 1: Well, you might have permanent unseen damage.

142
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:04,326
Speaker 1: True.

143
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:10,013
Speaker 0: But also the benefits of vaccinated, healthy, young and lucky can be a factor.

144
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:15,540
Speaker 0: So do not rely on being all four of those things because nobody is all four of those things forever.

145
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:17,021
Speaker 1: Yep.

146
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:23,430
Speaker 1: In fact, you might be some of all four of those things and afterwards not be all of those things anymore.

147
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,234
Speaker 0: All right.

148
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:26,976
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

149
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:29,519
Speaker 1: What was my news?

150
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:29,960
Speaker 1: I forgot.

151
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,743
Speaker 0: You are Queens, LaGuardia.

152
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:35,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

153
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:39,010
Speaker 0: So the second worst airport to fly into in the greater New York City area.

154
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,951
Speaker 0: Yeah.

155
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:46,159
Speaker 1: So LaGuardia Airport, you know, which is infamously not a great airport, is actually super close to where I live.

156
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,200
Speaker 1: I could comfortably.

157
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,986
Speaker 0: I have walked home from flights that landed in LaGuardia more than once.

158
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:55,329
Speaker 1: It is possible to walk there.

159
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:57,332
Speaker 1: It is trivial for me to bike there.

160
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:58,273
Speaker 1: It's that close.

161
00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:03,940
Speaker 0: It is also not hard to walk out of that airport, walk down city streets and then get out of subway.

162
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:04,840
Speaker 1: Yep.

163
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:09,165
Speaker 1: JFK, though, is is a much better airport, but it's way out there.

164
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:09,646
Speaker 1: Right.

165
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:13,751
Speaker 1: I mean, not way out there, but like I got to use trains to get over there or buses or something.

166
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:14,171
Speaker 1: Right.

167
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:16,374
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you're not walking to JFK.

168
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:17,495
Speaker 1: I could bike to JFK.

169
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:18,736
Speaker 1: It takes a while.

170
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:19,217
Speaker 0: Yep.

171
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:19,778
Speaker 0: Right.

172
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:21,840
Speaker 1: And they're not doing that with luggage either.

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,801
Speaker 0: So what does that just carry?

174
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,503
Speaker 0: They have the Rollie behind you like.

175
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:26,463
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

176
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:31,247
Speaker 1: Despite being so close, LaGuardia is actually harder to get to.

177
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:31,987
Speaker 0: Right.

178
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:32,608
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

179
00:11:32,628 --> 00:11:42,936
Speaker 0: There's a bus that if you try to take this bus, my experiences with it are thusly you'll stand at a spot, a stop three or four hours before your flight because you're a New Yorker and you're paranoid.

180
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:43,936
Speaker 0: The bus comes.

181
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:44,697
Speaker 0: It's already full.

182
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:46,158
Speaker 0: The doors don't even open and it leaves.

183
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:48,820
Speaker 0: This will keep happening until you give up and call a cab.

184
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,746
Speaker 1: So, yeah, despite being physically much, much closer, it is much harder to get to its right.

185
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:56,747
Speaker 1: It's closer to Manhattan.

186
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:59,730
Speaker 1: It's it's like, you know, it's like it makes no sense.

187
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:08,840
Speaker 1: So our previous shitty governor wanted to build a train like a special train that goes to LaGuardia from the subway.

188
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,582
Speaker 1: Good idea on paper.

189
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:14,566
Speaker 1: But the route selected for this train was inane.

190
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,493
Speaker 1: It involved going way past the airport and then taking a train backwards.

191
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:26,960
Speaker 1: It would only be beneficial for someone from Long Island who could take the Long Island Railroad and then go to the airport easily.

192
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,143
Speaker 0: I remember when we saw that original map and all of New York collectively said, what?

193
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:32,264
Speaker 1: Right.

194
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:38,948
Speaker 1: Most of the people I was most of the people who go to the airport, over 50 percent are coming from Manhattan.

195
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:45,793
Speaker 1: So it makes sense to have the train going from Manhattan to the airport on the left, the west side, not the east side.

196
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:46,753
Speaker 1: Anyway.

197
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,035
Speaker 1: So that was the plan.

198
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,436
Speaker 1: We got a new governor, new governor.

199
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:52,277
Speaker 1: Not perfect.

200
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:53,598
Speaker 1: Got some problems.

201
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,840
Speaker 1: But still, I guess at least one.

202
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,901
Speaker 1: Point better than the previous governor.

203
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:01,743
Speaker 1: That's not hard, but maybe even two points better.

204
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:02,123
Speaker 1: Right.

205
00:13:02,544 --> 00:13:08,528
Speaker 1: Still got problems, but better and improvement by at least some measures as change plans.

206
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,631
Speaker 1: And they had the Port Authority of New York, New Jersey.

207
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:12,931
Speaker 1: Right.

208
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:14,192
Speaker 1: Who runs these things?

209
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,213
Speaker 1: because don't even get me into that.

210
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:18,495
Speaker 1: What the Port Authority is.

211
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:20,656
Speaker 0: There's a movie.

212
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,118
Speaker 0: There's an old movie that's obscure that talks about the Port Authority.

213
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,500
Speaker 0: You can find anyway called Nothing Lasts Forever.

214
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,721
Speaker 0: It's basically a documentary.

215
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,982
Speaker 1: So they had some public hearings.

216
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:30,483
Speaker 1: Right.

217
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:32,584
Speaker 1: Of, you know, what the fuck should we do?

218
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:33,144
Speaker 1: Right.

219
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:33,725
Speaker 1: We're not going to.

220
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:35,586
Speaker 1: you know, we're not doing the old plan.

221
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:38,868
Speaker 1: What should we do to make LaGuardia more accessible?

222
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:39,409
Speaker 1: Right.

223
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:40,930
Speaker 1: Transportation wise.

224
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:46,313
Speaker 1: So I had previously attended similar hearings for a city bike.

225
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:51,357
Speaker 1: I did one that was a city bike workshop, which is where should we put the city bike docks in your neighborhood?

226
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:56,020
Speaker 1: And that one, the format was you sit at a table in a circle.

227
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,040
Speaker 1: Right.

228
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,103
Speaker 1: With a group of random people that you happen to be at a table with and you discuss.

229
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:01,463
Speaker 1: Right.

230
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:06,947
Speaker 1: And there are many such tables within, you know, and there was a Department of Transportation employee at each table.

231
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,669
Speaker 1: And they they collated their data afterwards.

232
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:13,031
Speaker 0: My answer is put up in every corner, every every intersection, whole city.

233
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:20,156
Speaker 1: I did a one of those for the Crescent Street bike lane, which is now existing and now has a concrete barrier.

234
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:20,656
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

235
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:21,217
Speaker 0: So get this.

236
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:26,420
Speaker 0: When I landed from London, my cabbie, I fell asleep in the cab in my mouth, just like.

237
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:30,403
Speaker 0: And he wakes me up, he's like, Crescent Street is closed.

238
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:30,863
Speaker 0: I'm like, what?

239
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:31,323
Speaker 0: All of it?

240
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:32,284
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, all of it.

241
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:33,165
Speaker 0: How where do you live?

242
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:40,030
Speaker 0: And when I got when I finally got home, I saw they had blocked Crescent Street because they were currently craning in the new barriers.

243
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:40,930
Speaker 1: Yep.

244
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:42,391
Speaker 0: It's all there now.

245
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,192
Speaker 0: It's beautiful.

246
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:44,052
Speaker 1: Yep.

247
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:51,798
Speaker 0: So and I already saw a black car that it somehow wedged it at an intersection, wedged itself in and appeared to be stuck.

248
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:54,800
Speaker 1: So anyway, so that was the same format for that one.

249
00:14:55,261 --> 00:15:01,100
Speaker 1: Then I did a bus, a bus route one, and the bus route one was of the worst format.

250
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,820
Speaker 1: This was the sort of town hall format.

251
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,860
Speaker 0: I mean, the bus anything is always the worst format.

252
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:18,800
Speaker 1: Where they do a slide show for the MTA, does a slide show, and then people then form as the idea that, oh, we're talking about buses, we got to make the presentation way worse.

253
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,820
Speaker 1: And then townies line up for the mic.

254
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:22,244
Speaker 1: Right.

255
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:23,859
Speaker 1: And that was a bad time, that one.

256
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:27,380
Speaker 1: So the LaGuardia one, this is Port Authority.

257
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,200
Speaker 1: So we went to Department of Transportation.

258
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:30,290
Speaker 1: We went to MTA.

259
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,340
Speaker 1: Now we're at Port Authority.

260
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:40,640
Speaker 1: How does the Port Authority run the public, you know, workshop for how do we make LaGuardia less shitty to get to and from?

261
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:41,903
Speaker 1: And you know what?

262
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:46,380
Speaker 1: To their credit, this is the best format I ever seen.

263
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,760
Speaker 1: I think this format should be used for a lot more things.

264
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,800
Speaker 1: The way it worked is they rent, they had a ballroom at the local wedding venue type place.

265
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:59,720
Speaker 1: And on each side of the ballroom, it was like a science fair.

266
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:07,960
Speaker 1: There were basically a poster board on an easel and each poster board had a transportation option, right?

267
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,900
Speaker 1: Some sort of thing that could be built and an attendant, right?

268
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,620
Speaker 1: Someone who worked for the Port Authority, who was very knowledgeable and could answer questions and explain the thing that was on the poster board.

269
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:21,045
Speaker 1: Right.

270
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:22,260
Speaker 1: Like the kid at the science fair.

271
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:29,500
Speaker 1: And so what you would do is you would go in and at your leisure, you would walk around examining the boards and talking to the people.

272
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:37,220
Speaker 1: And then there was a long table full of laptops and you went up to them and you typed in whatever the fuck thing you wanted to type in.

273
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,639
Speaker 0: See, that's how you keep the crazy townie.

274
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,199
Speaker 0: The crazy townie can type their screed into this text box.

275
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,880
Speaker 1: The crazy towner, the crazy and you could submit the form as many times as you want.

276
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,720
Speaker 1: So the crazy townie can write 10 screeds and it's not bothering anyone else.

277
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:54,260
Speaker 1: And they can just read it or delete it afterwards.

278
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:54,921
Speaker 1: Right.

279
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:59,414
Speaker 1: And the normal people can type in what they're going to type in and then you can leave at your.

280
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:01,300
Speaker 1: you don't have to sit there and listen to anything.

281
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,740
Speaker 1: You know, so this is an excellent format.

282
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,440
Speaker 1: A lot of the people who were standing at the boards were extremely knowledgeable.

283
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,198
Speaker 1: I learned all kinds of things I didn't know.

284
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:14,720
Speaker 1: And the thing that I found the most encouraging was that, you know, they had so many options, right?

285
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:23,420
Speaker 1: Not only did they have the existing option that, you know, the previous governor wanted to do, they had different light rails, subway extensions.

286
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,421
Speaker 0: That's the big one.

287
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:33,720
Speaker 0: The fact that they included subway extensions because it is somebody to build a subway extension to New York compared to anything else is like it's orders of magnitude more money for reasons.

288
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,509
Speaker 1: Protected bus lanes, ferry ferry terminals, like so many options they had.

289
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:47,159
Speaker 1: underground, above ground, go along the Grand Central, go into the BQE.

290
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:50,692
Speaker 1: And they were like and not only that, but they were like.

291
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:52,320
Speaker 1: these options are not mutually exclusive.

292
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:56,100
Speaker 1: They're like we could do the ferry and the bus and the subway extension.

293
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,238
Speaker 1: They don't bump into each other.

294
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:57,800
Speaker 1: Right.

295
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:02,880
Speaker 0: Like, you know, imagine an airport with more than one way to get out of it.

296
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:04,600
Speaker 0: That's what most European airports are like.

297
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,173
Speaker 1: That wasn't a car.

298
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:05,480
Speaker 1: Yeah.

299
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,241
Speaker 1: Yeah.

300
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:12,754
Speaker 1: So most of my input was pretty much like, hey, none of these options that you.

301
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,560
Speaker 1: you have lots of options here, boat, train, bus.

302
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:16,286
Speaker 1: Right.

303
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:17,219
Speaker 1: All kinds of things.

304
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:24,340
Speaker 1: I don't see any bike or foot options on here, which again, for something that is so fucking close.

305
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:26,480
Speaker 1: I'm like, just put a city bike dock there.

306
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,024
Speaker 0: Come on.

307
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:28,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you know someone would use it.

308
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,259
Speaker 0: In fact, there were some flights where I would have used it.

309
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,540
Speaker 1: If you're doing a flight where all you got is a backpack, carry on, it's like, you know, I could totally city bike to LaGuardia and back.

310
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,422
Speaker 1: No problem.

311
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:48,699
Speaker 0: How liberating that liberating would that feel to land from a flight somewhere, walk out of the airport, get on a bike and just bike home?

312
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:49,723
Speaker 1: Yep.

313
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:53,060
Speaker 1: And in like 15 minutes to 20 minutes, maybe tops.

314
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:54,788
Speaker 0: Right.

315
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:57,119
Speaker 0: Probably about as long as it takes to take a cab out of there.

316
00:18:57,863 --> 00:18:58,164
Speaker 1: Yeah.

317
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,639
Speaker 1: So I say, you know, who knows what they're going to do?

318
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:04,360
Speaker 1: Are they going to choose what I said that they should choose?

319
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:04,883
Speaker 1: Who knows?

320
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:07,620
Speaker 1: But excellent format for workshop.

321
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:09,406
Speaker 1: Yeah.

322
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:10,098
Speaker 0: Yeah.

323
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:16,440
Speaker 0: I feel like the only way you could go better would be to let people type their screen.

324
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:34,840
Speaker 0: But if you could come up with questions about the proposals that let you do a conjoint analysis of the like mean preference of the group instead of people just trying to get their own idea out, like when you force people to choose of the 14 options, which you like better, 11 or 14, like force those kinds of decisions.

325
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:39,360
Speaker 0: You can tease out ideas that people, some of them were mutually exclusive, right?

326
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,501
Speaker 1: Like.

327
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,180
Speaker 1: there were two different subway extensions.

328
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,300
Speaker 1: One goes through Astoria, right?

329
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:43,520
Speaker 1: Like.

330
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:54,620
Speaker 1: and then one like a long dip Mars and another one goes north out past Astoria, like behind all the industrial shit, past the power plants and then takes a hook to the east.

331
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,001
Speaker 1: Right.

332
00:19:55,943 --> 00:20:03,660
Speaker 0: I was like having a line that came from Manhattan under the river and under Randall's Island all the way across and just intersecting the top of it.

333
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,520
Speaker 0: Mars, then just going all the way out into Queens.

334
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:07,339
Speaker 1: That wasn't one of the options.

335
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,400
Speaker 0: No, that that that wasn't even that was barely an option in the original subway.

336
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,040
Speaker 1: There was an option to improve the, you know, the buses that go, you know, over Randall's Island.

337
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:26,220
Speaker 0: So anything to make Randall's Island more accessible to people without cars, because that island is a treasure and the buses that go there are the worst.

338
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,350
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

339
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,630
Speaker 0: So we've talked about Dua Lipa on Geek Nights a few times.

340
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,650
Speaker 0: Fantastic performer, fantastic musician.

341
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:45,890
Speaker 0: And Dua Lipa has a song called Levitating.

342
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,350
Speaker 0: Scott made it his thing of the day a while ago.

343
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:48,837
Speaker 0: I think it was you.

344
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:49,630
Speaker 0: I think you called Dibz on it.

345
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,910
Speaker 0: The music video was the thing of the day, not the song.

346
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:53,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the song is great.

347
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,029
Speaker 0: The song has a music video.

348
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:01,010
Speaker 0: The song also has an official music video animated in the style of Sailor Moon.

349
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,330
Speaker 0: And it's just delightful.

350
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:15,190
Speaker 0: So some band or some label that represents a band is suing Dua Lipa, claiming that the song Levitating is, in fact, plagiarizing their song.

351
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,830
Speaker 0: And their song does sound superficially very similar to the song.

352
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:33,150
Speaker 0: So Adam Neely has done a very helpful video where he shows that thousands of songs are just as close to both of these songs as the people are suing and how this lawsuit is absolutely ridiculous.

353
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,269
Speaker 0: It's almost definitely guaranteed to fail.

354
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:40,070
Speaker 0: But if it succeeds, it destroys the concept of music copyright, basically.

355
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,850
Speaker 1: Well, it's already sort of been destroyed, right?

356
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:46,570
Speaker 1: So there's a huge issue going on in the music industry.

357
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,829
Speaker 1: It's been going on for a while.

358
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:56,530
Speaker 1: But basically, you can get money for free if you can get songwriting credits on a song.

359
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:56,870
Speaker 1: Right.

360
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:02,290
Speaker 1: So let's say, you know, Rim writes a song completely on his own.

361
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:04,850
Speaker 1: He's never listened to anyone else's music in his life.

362
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:07,130
Speaker 1: He's only listened to public domain classical music.

363
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,589
Speaker 1: He's never listened to anything else.

364
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:12,050
Speaker 0: Like when I was in IBM and I signed some stuff saying I'd never used real Java.

365
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:13,292
Speaker 1: Right.

366
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:17,750
Speaker 1: And he writes some song and it sounds like doo doo doo doo doo doo.

367
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,065
Speaker 1: Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

368
00:22:19,227 --> 00:22:19,470
Speaker 1: Right.

369
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:22,210
Speaker 1: Which is not a classical song.

370
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:23,135
Speaker 0: Right.

371
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:24,849
Speaker 0: No, but mine's got a little "ch" in it.

372
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:26,433
Speaker 1: Yeah.

373
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:30,069
Speaker 1: So Rim writes that song, literally legitimately, 100 percent on his own.

374
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:36,950
Speaker 1: You know, but then someone else comes along and is like, hey, I wrote that song, actually.

375
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,412
Speaker 1: Right.

376
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:38,148
Speaker 1: Listen to my song.

377
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:40,630
Speaker 0: And vanilla ice starts playing his song.

378
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,691
Speaker 1: Right.

379
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:48,670
Speaker 1: And then someone else comes along and says, I wrote, you know, it's like and there are only so many fucking songs that can be made.

380
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:49,291
Speaker 1: Right.

381
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:52,250
Speaker 1: And there's so many people using samples these days and all their songs.

382
00:22:52,751 --> 00:23:08,109
Speaker 1: So what ends up happening is rather than fight a protracted legal battle, which is just often, you know, not worth it, even if you win a lot of hit songs these days, the song writing credits get chopped up.

383
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:08,832
Speaker 1: Right.

384
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:19,989
Speaker 1: Not just the people, you know, you'll usually have a group of songwriters writing the song initially and then more and more names just get added on there with various percentages, just getting a piece.

385
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:20,552
Speaker 1: Right.

386
00:23:20,572 --> 00:23:21,509
Speaker 1: Everyone's got to get their piece.

387
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:29,314
Speaker 1: So when someone listens or performs to the song and royalties come in, the money is getting divided up.

388
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:34,270
Speaker 1: You know, these micro pennies from their Spotify streams are getting divided up amongst all these people.

389
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,913
Speaker 1: Right.

390
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:47,435
Speaker 1: So it's like if you write a song, even if you write it completely on your own, it's like if it sounds similar to something else, which it probably will, and that person is listening and litigious.

391
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:51,150
Speaker 1: or, you know, it's like there's free money in it for them.

392
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:55,830
Speaker 1: And this for you, you only have things to lose.

393
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,868
Speaker 1: You have nothing to gain.

394
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:01,970
Speaker 1: You're probably going to end up giving them a piece or fighting.

395
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:04,550
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's a tough choice.

396
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:09,532
Speaker 1: So this keeps happening because the incentives are all misaligned and the system is broken.

397
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:15,009
Speaker 0: And this one is really interesting because Adam does a really deep sort of musicological analysis of it.

398
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:18,790
Speaker 0: But then he also points out that this lawsuit does something weird.

399
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:33,350
Speaker 0: All the other lawsuits, all the ones you're probably more familiar with, they make at some point in their legal argument, a music theory argument like they actually bring out music theory and shows like notation and chord progressions.

400
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,530
Speaker 0: And they make this case that they are fundamentally the same song.

401
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:40,469
Speaker 0: But here, this lawsuit actually doesn't do that at all.

402
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:50,290
Speaker 0: And it seems to focus entirely on specific older songs that sound like this song without actually doing a musicological analysis.

403
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:59,570
Speaker 0: So his argument, at least, is that this is an even easier lawsuit for Dua Lipa to win because they can just point out even older songs that sound even more similar.

404
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,669
Speaker 0: There's prior art and the whole thing gets thrown out.

405
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,231
Speaker 1: Yeah.

406
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:06,170
Speaker 1: OK, so I just went to Rollingstone.com, you know, the music industry magazine.

407
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:08,750
Speaker 1: I did a search for songwriting credits.

408
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:09,392
Speaker 1: Right.

409
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:11,110
Speaker 1: So you're ready for listen to these headlines.

410
00:25:11,731 --> 00:25:16,372
Speaker 1: March twenty twenty two, Lizzo reaches settlement over Truth Hurts songwriting credits.

411
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:19,870
Speaker 1: March twenty twenty two, experts do a Dua Lipa one.

412
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,760
Speaker 1: March fourth, Post Malone skewers.

413
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,349
Speaker 1: musicians suing for Circles credit can't prove original contribution.

414
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,690
Speaker 1: February twenty eighteen, right.

415
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,830
Speaker 1: Frank Ocean's who's blonde producer over songwriting credits.

416
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:37,630
Speaker 1: Twenty fifteen, Paul McCartney talks, Nix McCartney, Lennon songwriting credit.

417
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,614
Speaker 1: Twenty nineteen, Rolling Stones finally give back bittersweet symphony songwriting credits.

418
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:45,270
Speaker 1: Twenty twenty one, which Natalie Hemby performed.

419
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:46,273
Speaker 1: Oh, that's different.

420
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:48,403
Speaker 1: OK, the point is this keeps.

421
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:49,327
Speaker 1: those are the.

422
00:25:49,427 --> 00:25:53,749
Speaker 1: obviously those have articles on Rolling Stone because those are, you know, the biggest of the bigs.

423
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,132
Speaker 1: Right.

424
00:25:54,212 --> 00:25:57,070
Speaker 1: But, you know, there's a lot.

425
00:25:57,371 --> 00:26:02,310
Speaker 1: Twenty twenty one, Noah Ford, you should be clarifies R. Kelly credit on Drake certified lover boy.

426
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:04,889
Speaker 1: It's like this, you know, goes on and on and on.

427
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:11,414
Speaker 1: This is what is happening in the music industry and has been happening for the past five to 10 years.

428
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:21,754
Speaker 0: And it seems like a big part of it is if these do go to trials, which they have in some cases, juries don't understand any of this and they sound kind of the same.

429
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:22,969
Speaker 0: So juries tend to say yes.

430
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:24,515
Speaker 1: Yes, there have been.

431
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:30,310
Speaker 1: I forget which case it was, was sort of like, you know, one of the Campbell's straw back ones.

432
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,130
Speaker 1: But there was like there was some big ones that, you know, went and set a bad precedent.

433
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:36,289
Speaker 1: And that's why people keep going after it.

434
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:36,852
Speaker 0: But yeah.

435
00:26:36,872 --> 00:26:46,829
Speaker 0: So her twenty twenty song, the people suing her saying it's their twenty seventeen song and their twenty seventeen song sounds like it's based heavily on songs from like going as far back as the thirties.

436
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,869
Speaker 0: So, yep.

437
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,307
Speaker 0: So anyway, what's your thing of the day?

438
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:53,590
Speaker 1: What the hell was my thing of the day?

439
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:53,991
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

440
00:26:54,072 --> 00:27:00,174
Speaker 1: So this video is from twenty fourteen, I think it's old, but it was new to me.

441
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:01,388
Speaker 1: So deal with it.

442
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:13,850
Speaker 1: So the University of Georgia, a warm place, relatively speaking, it is a you know, the University of Georgia is still an enormous university.

443
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:14,312
Speaker 1: Right.

444
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:17,910
Speaker 1: Big, you know, not like RIT, a small private university where we went.

445
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:18,173
Speaker 1: Right.

446
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:19,449
Speaker 1: It's like a huge, huge place.

447
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:21,049
Speaker 1: Lots of lots of students.

448
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:23,969
Speaker 1: So they did have an ice hockey team.

449
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:24,533
Speaker 1: Right.

450
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:25,569
Speaker 1: I think they still do.

451
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,870
Speaker 1: It's they're the Bulldogs.

452
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:29,069
Speaker 1: But I think that the ice hockey team is the ice dogs.

453
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:36,930
Speaker 1: So but they didn't have an arena, an ice hockey rink, at least not a permanent one that was on campus or anything.

454
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:37,491
Speaker 1: Right.

455
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:42,450
Speaker 1: But in twenty fourteen, I guess they wanted to play some home ice hockey games.

456
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:53,770
Speaker 1: So what they did is they got a portable ice rink from Ice America, which is a company that can set up an ice rink basically anywhere you pay them to if you can afford it.

457
00:27:54,851 --> 00:28:01,170
Speaker 1: And they set it up in the ballroom because they have an enormous fucking ballroom at their at their university.

458
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:01,632
Speaker 1: Right.

459
00:28:01,652 --> 00:28:06,350
Speaker 1: Like tremendous, really big enough to hold a full size ice rink and seats.

460
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:19,870
Speaker 1: And in this video, Ice America shows how they set up a portable ice rink indoors in just a big room with no right.

461
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,349
Speaker 1: It's like without making water fall through the ceiling to whatever's below.

462
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:25,915
Speaker 0: I mean, we did it.

463
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,530
Speaker 0: We did an episode water in the ceiling for a reason.

464
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:33,153
Speaker 0: I cannot imagine a more perfect storm of water in the ceiling than trying to make an ice rink like this.

465
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:36,750
Speaker 1: They get they get a full sized Zamboni in there.

466
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:38,730
Speaker 1: They get, you know, grandstands in there.

467
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,730
Speaker 1: Not that many seats, but enough seats.

468
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:41,152
Speaker 1: Right.

469
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:53,249
Speaker 1: It's like they get, you know, how many layers of ice and they set the whole thing up and like in a warm place, by the way, in, you know, 48 hours or whatever, you know, not it doesn't take them long to set it up.

470
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,110
Speaker 1: I don't know how long it takes to undo it, but it's pretty impressive.

471
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:07,789
Speaker 1: And if you have enough money and you need an ice rink and you want to put the ice rink somewhere that ice rinks shouldn't be, but you have enough room for it.

472
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:13,470
Speaker 1: I if Ice America still exists and you're in America, I think they're the ones to call.

473
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:22,466
Speaker 0: In the moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book that we are going to do an episode on for, let's say, two weeks from now.

474
00:29:23,393 --> 00:29:23,779
Speaker 0: Let's do it.

475
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:24,549
Speaker 0: The next Thursday show.

476
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,116
Speaker 0: So April 14th, you've had.

477
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:36,709
Speaker 1: you've had three months, which is, you know, if we weren't fucking up and spending two to three years, three months is a good amount of time to read a book that took me less than two weeks, maybe.

478
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:39,383
Speaker 0: So I'm near.

479
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:40,530
Speaker 0: I've read a bunch of it.

480
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,239
Speaker 0: I'll definitely finish.

481
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:42,010
Speaker 0: This is such a show.

482
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,830
Speaker 1: We didn't finish it, even though you took a. you went to London, all that.

483
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,468
Speaker 0: I was actually really busy on the trip and then I got sick.

484
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:49,433
Speaker 1: Yeah.

485
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:51,567
Speaker 1: Lick it, licking, licking people.

486
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,330
Speaker 0: I mean, I mean, the trip was a doorknob licking convention.

487
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:01,151
Speaker 0: So in retrospect, that might have that might have been more more excuses for workers come.

488
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:07,430
Speaker 0: You know, the worst thing was when I was like walking around, I was wearing a mask and I was the only person in London.

489
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:11,670
Speaker 0: I think every single person I interacted with had to say something about the mask.

490
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,510
Speaker 0: Like, oh, you Americans like everyone's like, oh, you're paranoid.

491
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,354
Speaker 0: Like an American.

492
00:30:15,374 --> 00:30:18,448
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I got sick from you dirty.

493
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,550
Speaker 0: So this book is very New York.

494
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:29,930
Speaker 0: I really Scott said this before, but I want to reiterate, I want to know what you think of this book if you don't know anything about New York City.

495
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:35,670
Speaker 1: Or even if you know things about New York, but you know, you're not you don't you're not.

496
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:44,289
Speaker 0: you know, you haven't spent a lot of time and even I thought of your Manhattan and then quote the outer boroughs until I moved here.

497
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:52,730
Speaker 0: Then I started to recognize, like Queens and Brooklyn are very different from each other and Staten Island is technically part of New York City.

498
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,469
Speaker 0: I kind of didn't know that when I was a kid.

499
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:05,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, most mass media doesn't usually deal with subject matter that the wide audience wouldn't know without like teaching it to them first.

500
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,050
Speaker 1: A superhero movie won't even assume, you know, the origin of the superhero.

501
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:09,671
Speaker 1: Right.

502
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:15,970
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they got to make sure that, you know, Batman's parents are dead and Spider-Man got bit and Superman's an alien.

503
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,415
Speaker 1: Right.

504
00:31:16,436 --> 00:31:16,601
Speaker 1: Right.

505
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:23,053
Speaker 1: But it's like if you go watch a movie about baseball, they don't teach you what baseball is.

506
00:31:23,073 --> 00:31:23,213
Speaker 1: Right.

507
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:25,204
Speaker 1: They assume, you know, what baseball is.

508
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:27,929
Speaker 1: if you're going to go watch fucking, I don't know, Bull Durham.

509
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:28,571
Speaker 1: Right.

510
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:37,108
Speaker 1: But this book, it's like it assumes, you know, what New York is just the way Bull Durham assumes, you know, what baseball is.

511
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:37,571
Speaker 1: Right.

512
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:45,150
Speaker 1: So, you know, if you don't know enough about New York, I'm still really curious how the book comes across.

513
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:49,730
Speaker 1: Some some of the listener have told me, but I want to hear from more of the listeners.

514
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:51,775
Speaker 0: So.

515
00:31:51,835 --> 00:32:01,710
Speaker 0: And the other thing I can say is that every character, like this whole book, every time a new character appears, they are absolutely fantastic without exception.

516
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,454
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

517
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:06,070
Speaker 0: Even the bad characters, when they actually show up, are great.

518
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:15,249
Speaker 1: Well, because it's like it's they're great and not that they're people you like the most, even though some of them you like the most or many of them.

519
00:32:15,712 --> 00:32:18,890
Speaker 1: But they are so exactly correct.

520
00:32:19,011 --> 00:32:20,729
Speaker 1: It's like, yep, that's that guy.

521
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:23,970
Speaker 1: That's exactly how that kind of guy is in the real world.

522
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:28,569
Speaker 0: When you meet Staten Island girl pretty early on, it's like, wow, wow.

523
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:33,430
Speaker 1: I've interacted with what Staten Island girl is like.

524
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, 100 percent.

525
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:34,870
Speaker 1: Right.

526
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,747
Speaker 1: I know that person.

527
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:39,329
Speaker 1: I'm not friends with that person, but I know I have met that person.

528
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:39,731
Speaker 1: Yup.

529
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:43,750
Speaker 0: I definitely I know a lot of Manny's in the work that I do.

530
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,613
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

531
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:51,190
Speaker 0: But it's so like without spoiling things, it's so self-aware.

532
00:32:52,052 --> 00:33:03,164
Speaker 0: Like, man, you know, Manny is a good guy in terms of like what the story is trying to do, but also a checkered past, shall we say, like not.

533
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:14,929
Speaker 0: not everything that Manny does is good and or that many did was good because that, you know, Manhattan's identity is about a lot of the cruelty that has been inflicted by Manhattan, not just about the cool parts of Manhattan.

534
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:16,033
Speaker 1: Yep.

535
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,570
Speaker 1: Anyway, anything else?

536
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,750
Speaker 1: Meadow packs is real soon and it's actually happening for real.

537
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:23,422
Speaker 1: I'm not going.

538
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:23,768
Speaker 0: Yep.

539
00:33:24,513 --> 00:33:27,430
Speaker 0: I will be there Thursday, April twenty first.

540
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:30,010
Speaker 0: That is long outside of my quarantine period.

541
00:33:30,753 --> 00:33:33,050
Speaker 0: Of course, I'll take negative tests before that or I'll just bail.

542
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:35,850
Speaker 0: But Thursday, April twenty first, seven p.m.

543
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:43,510
Speaker 0: Bumblebee Theater, a live and significantly updated version of Atari Game Design.

544
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,310
Speaker 0: I think it'll be fun if you're not there.

545
00:33:46,451 --> 00:33:48,908
Speaker 0: I'm going to video it, of course, just like I did for Unplugged.

546
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:52,530
Speaker 0: So do not go to PAX East just because I'm going to be there.

547
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:58,842
Speaker 0: I will definitely put that panel online before the end of PAX East, just like I did with PAX Unplugged.

548
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:05,710
Speaker 1: You know, I'm not holding out any hope for PAX West, but, you know, I might go.

549
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:06,371
Speaker 1: We'll see.

550
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:09,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I I'm like.

551
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,370
Speaker 0: I'm cautiously optimistic as I am about many things.

552
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,016
Speaker 0: We'll see what happens.

553
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:14,449
Speaker 1: I'm not setting any expectation.

554
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:14,753
Speaker 1: Right.

555
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:16,668
Speaker 1: I'll decide when the time comes.

556
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:20,984
Speaker 1: I would like to go, obviously, but I'm not going to.

557
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:24,889
Speaker 1: I'm not going to set myself up to be like disappointed by not going or anything like that.

558
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:39,648
Speaker 0: The exciting thing I'll just mention briefly is that PAX, once we're post covid and like we're going to PAX is like normal again, PAX has started to set up interesting panel adjacent, but not just panel like content types like I do.

559
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,630
Speaker 1: You know, assuming PAX survives or other conventions survive as well.

560
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:55,909
Speaker 1: I do think that, you know, many conventions have sadly died, but they're the conventions that live are definitely have been invigorated.

561
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,790
Speaker 1: You know, they're not selling out their tickets.

562
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:07,590
Speaker 1: So they're trying a lot harder content wise, you know, doing things that we thought they should have done a long time ago, experimenting, et cetera.

563
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:08,633
Speaker 1: And I like that.

564
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:14,396
Speaker 0: So, yeah, like if it wasn't covid times, we would have I feel like we would have done like this.

565
00:35:14,558 --> 00:35:16,270
Speaker 0: upcoming PAX East might have been one of those.

566
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,730
Speaker 0: We signed up to do too many things conventions.

567
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:28,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, even in the mid to late 2000s, we were trying to get conventions to try out, you know, things that conventions weren't already doing kinds of content.

568
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,789
Speaker 0: Otacon used to not mail its badges.

569
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:35,650
Speaker 0: They accused Scott of threatening them by telling them to mail the badges.

570
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:38,749
Speaker 0: And look where we are now.

571
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,049
Speaker 0: Everybody mails the badges.

572
00:35:42,512 --> 00:35:47,409
Speaker 0: The problem is, if PAX does all this stuff, we're running out of things we wanted that cons haven't done.

573
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:49,288
Speaker 0: We haven't come up with many new things.

574
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:55,350
Speaker 0: I guess the last one would be curated screenings at anime conventions.

575
00:35:56,291 --> 00:36:03,330
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, let's move on to the I can't believe never done a show on James Bond.

576
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,789
Speaker 0: Like I thought it felt like one of those things we just had to have done.

577
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:15,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's one of the major franchises of, you know, media entertainment in the, you know, the the English speaking world and even the rest of the world.

578
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:17,630
Speaker 0: And it's one that is still going.

579
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:23,549
Speaker 0: The reason we thought of it is I suggested, you know, on the flight home, I watched No Time to Die, the last Daniel.

580
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:24,676
Speaker 0: I guess spoilers.

581
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:26,809
Speaker 0: It's the last Daniel Craig, James Bond.

582
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:27,776
Speaker 1: Yep.

583
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:28,849
Speaker 0: But I watched it.

584
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:29,614
Speaker 0: It was OK.

585
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:32,090
Speaker 0: It was an above average Bond movie.

586
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:38,293
Speaker 0: It was the second best Daniel Craig movie, though I haven't seen Quantum of Solace or Spectre.

587
00:36:39,218 --> 00:36:41,270
Speaker 1: I only saw the first Daniel Craig one and that's it.

588
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:46,670
Speaker 0: The thing is, Casino Royale was great, except my only complaint about that as a bomb.

589
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:50,530
Speaker 0: I hardly remember it was that it kind of followed the book too closely.

590
00:36:50,790 --> 00:37:04,490
Speaker 0: And the book has a few like improbable events that happened, which depending like, I guess the Daniel Craig, James Bond felt too gritty and realistic for the somewhat unrealistic thing that happened in the last third of that movie.

591
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:09,150
Speaker 0: Anyway, but now like a Pierce Brosnan where he's just got magic.

592
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,310
Speaker 0: He's basically just a wizard.

593
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:11,710
Speaker 0: Like every James Bond is different.

594
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:13,150
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

595
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:26,953
Speaker 1: So, I mean, James Bond is pretty significant in my life media wise because, right, it was significant in my parents life, especially my mom is like a huge James Bond fan, like big time.

596
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:27,154
Speaker 1: Right.

597
00:37:27,174 --> 00:37:31,353
Speaker 1: It's like before like, you know, I guess my mom also like Star Wars a lot.

598
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:34,830
Speaker 1: But you got to remember, before Star Wars even fucking existed.

599
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:35,832
Speaker 1: Right.

600
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:41,093
Speaker 1: It's like she was going to see every James Bond movie in the movie theater as soon as it came out.

601
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:48,669
Speaker 0: And unlike, say, Indiana Jones or how by the time Star Wars existed, your parents had been through three bonds.

602
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:49,812
Speaker 1: Right.

603
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:50,535
Speaker 1: Exactly.

604
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:54,570
Speaker 1: It's like there were the James Bond movies kept coming.

605
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,217
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they were.

606
00:37:56,237 --> 00:38:00,829
Speaker 1: they were like this constant, always their thing, much easier to be a fan of back then.

607
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:01,091
Speaker 1: Yeah.

608
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:08,270
Speaker 0: Look, sixty two, sixty three, sixty four, five, seven, nine, seventy one, seventy three every year or year or maybe two years at most.

609
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:09,073
Speaker 1: Yeah.

610
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:14,770
Speaker 1: And it's like even when, you know, Star Wars comes and overshadows it, it's like, oh, got three Star Wars movies.

611
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,394
Speaker 1: Whoa.

612
00:38:15,435 --> 00:38:15,576
Speaker 1: Right.

613
00:38:15,616 --> 00:38:17,330
Speaker 1: It's like James Bond didn't stop.

614
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,349
Speaker 1: He just kept going.

615
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:19,113
Speaker 1: Right.

616
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:20,258
Speaker 1: There was there was a.

617
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:22,730
Speaker 0: there was a long pause after Timothy Dalton.

618
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:24,590
Speaker 0: It was a while before there was more bond.

619
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,910
Speaker 1: Remember between Timothy Dalton and Goldeneye was that was the break period.

620
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:30,176
Speaker 1: Yeah.

621
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:33,170
Speaker 1: But it's like for a long time it kept going.

622
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:36,070
Speaker 1: And then once it got started again, it kept going again.

623
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:36,472
Speaker 1: Right.

624
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:39,590
Speaker 1: So in it, you know, it's still going now.

625
00:38:39,691 --> 00:38:41,610
Speaker 1: We'll see when they start up again.

626
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,390
Speaker 1: But, yeah, it's like we had an ever present thing.

627
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:58,669
Speaker 1: And also, I think that, you know, it was introduced to, you know, we read a lot of stories from nerds who go about impressioning their kids the wrong way, trying to force their kids to like the same thing they like.

628
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:04,770
Speaker 1: You know, I've read some possibly false stories on, you know, various redheads.

629
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,674
Speaker 1: It could have been made up.

630
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:17,850
Speaker 1: But, you know, they're believable stories, at least where, you know, some parent names all their kids after Harry Potter characters and makes everyone watch Harry Potter and cosplays Harry Potter all the time.

631
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,594
Speaker 1: Right.

632
00:39:18,695 --> 00:39:20,849
Speaker 1: And it's like and the kids aren't into Harry Potter.

633
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:21,836
Speaker 1: It's like.

634
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,310
Speaker 1: that's not the healthy way to do it.

635
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:23,611
Speaker 1: Right.

636
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:29,333
Speaker 1: You know, but, you know, my mom, it's like she wasn't like sit down or watching James Bond.

637
00:39:29,373 --> 00:39:39,485
Speaker 1: She was like she really only did two things, which was a. You know, express to us that she was a big like, you know, she.

638
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:43,489
Speaker 1: she was not ashamed to let everyone know she fucking loved James Bond.

639
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:44,332
Speaker 1: Right.

640
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,886
Speaker 1: And to shoot watching his model was on TV.

641
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:49,853
Speaker 1: Right.

642
00:39:50,395 --> 00:39:53,630
Speaker 1: And wouldn't be upset if she would like make anyone watch.

643
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:55,502
Speaker 1: But it's like, why wouldn't you watch?

644
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:56,670
Speaker 1: the movies are actually fucking good.

645
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,255
Speaker 0: Some of them.

646
00:39:58,756 --> 00:40:06,529
Speaker 0: I mean, I think like my parents just put on Star Wars one day and about 20 minutes into it, suddenly my kid brain was like, wait a minute, this is really.

647
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:07,114
Speaker 0: this is cool.

648
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:08,549
Speaker 0: This is my favorite thing on Earth now.

649
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:11,710
Speaker 0: My parents didn't try to indoctrinate me into Star Wars.

650
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,890
Speaker 0: They just put it on and I happen to like it.

651
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:16,454
Speaker 1: Yeah.

652
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:19,410
Speaker 1: So James Bond itself started out as some books.

653
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,589
Speaker 1: Have you ever read a James Bond book?

654
00:40:20,913 --> 00:40:21,690
Speaker 0: Only Casino Royale.

655
00:40:22,472 --> 00:40:24,182
Speaker 1: I've never read any James Bond book, so I can't.

656
00:40:24,262 --> 00:40:28,539
Speaker 1: I can't tell you if they're good or not.

657
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,649
Speaker 0: Oh, which apparently is the weird one where like the licensing was different for that one compared to every other James Bond book.

658
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:35,082
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're all written by.

659
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:35,729
Speaker 1: what's his name?

660
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:37,183
Speaker 1: What's the guy's name?

661
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:37,790
Speaker 0: Fleming.

662
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:39,194
Speaker 1: Yeah, Fleming.

663
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:41,707
Speaker 1: But anyway, the movies.

664
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:42,975
Speaker 1: Right.

665
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:44,570
Speaker 1: They adapted the books and the movies.

666
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,048
Speaker 1: And that was what the broccoli is.

667
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,392
Speaker 1: Right.

668
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:48,270
Speaker 1: What a great last name, broccoli.

669
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:56,373
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the broccoli family estate has the movie like control of the movie biz part of it.

670
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:00,030
Speaker 1: But yeah, it started off, you know, black and white movies.

671
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:01,246
Speaker 1: The first one is a Dr.

672
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:01,913
Speaker 1: No.

673
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:02,280
Speaker 1: Right.

674
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:02,790
Speaker 1: With the rocket.

675
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:03,352
Speaker 0: Dr.

676
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:04,207
Speaker 0: No was the first one.

677
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,810
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty two with Sean Connery, the dragon playing James Bond.

678
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:10,351
Speaker 1: Right.

679
00:41:11,476 --> 00:41:14,210
Speaker 1: And then after Sean Connery stopped doing it late.

680
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:14,534
Speaker 1: Right.

681
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:15,709
Speaker 1: They switched to Roger Moore.

682
00:41:16,953 --> 00:41:18,570
Speaker 0: You already skipped someone.

683
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:20,021
Speaker 1: Oh, did I?

684
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:20,609
Speaker 1: Who did I miss?

685
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:21,674
Speaker 0: Lazenby.

686
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,189
Speaker 1: Oh, who cares about Lazenby?

687
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,810
Speaker 0: Because remember, he did one and then Sean Connery came back.

688
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:28,659
Speaker 1: But Lazenby was.

689
00:41:29,062 --> 00:41:29,849
Speaker 1: no one cares about him.

690
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:30,232
Speaker 0: Yeah.

691
00:41:30,776 --> 00:41:32,670
Speaker 1: So no one cares about Timothy Dalton either.

692
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:38,456
Speaker 0: You know, I care about Lazenby because for for whatever reason, that was the bond I saw first.

693
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:39,849
Speaker 0: I have this memory as a kid.

694
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:40,518
Speaker 0: So get this.

695
00:41:40,538 --> 00:41:41,469
Speaker 0: I had a memory as a kid.

696
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:42,796
Speaker 0: This movie was on.

697
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:46,733
Speaker 0: And as the spy stuff going on, it was on my grandparents gigantic projection TV.

698
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:51,370
Speaker 0: And all the adults were like talking about it disparagingly.

699
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:52,930
Speaker 0: And then I was like, what's this movie?

700
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,715
Speaker 0: It looks pretty cool.

701
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:55,930
Speaker 0: And all the adults were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

702
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,019
Speaker 0: You haven't seen any of these.

703
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,330
Speaker 0: And they made a big hoorah.

704
00:41:58,875 --> 00:41:59,501
Speaker 0: And they were.

705
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:00,450
Speaker 1: they were they were right.

706
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:03,130
Speaker 0: And they were like, no, we're going to we're going to watch.

707
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:09,303
Speaker 0: And they dug out and we watched Sean Connery, James Bond instead, because they didn't want that to be my first bond.

708
00:42:09,343 --> 00:42:09,930
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

709
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,209
Speaker 0: I was like five.

710
00:42:14,152 --> 00:42:14,252
Speaker 1: Yeah.

711
00:42:14,272 --> 00:42:18,549
Speaker 1: Anyway, so then you had Roger Moore, right, who was actually.

712
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,589
Speaker 0: I think it was Thunderball, if I really think about it.

713
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:21,748
Speaker 1: Well, that's like the best one.

714
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,190
Speaker 1: That's like anyway.

715
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:27,690
Speaker 1: And then you had Timothy Dalton, who no one cares.

716
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:35,208
Speaker 1: And then you had Pierce Brosnan, who, you know, I think if not for the video game, nobody would have cared.

717
00:42:36,331 --> 00:42:36,491
Speaker 0: He's.

718
00:42:36,692 --> 00:42:45,490
Speaker 0: it's weird because I already encounter people who are very nostalgic for the Pierce Brosnan era of Bond, even though I'll admit it is my least favorite era.

719
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:47,678
Speaker 0: But I don't count the one offs like.

720
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,610
Speaker 1: I mean, he's better than Lazenby and Dalton.

721
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,534
Speaker 1: But that's about it.

722
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,270
Speaker 0: I mean, Dalton got twice as many Bond movies as Lazenby.

723
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:55,786
Speaker 0: So sure.

724
00:42:57,832 --> 00:43:01,170
Speaker 0: But I did not like the Pierce Brosnan Bond at all.

725
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:05,950
Speaker 0: Like he was just he was a magic wizard man wielding magic wizard gadgets.

726
00:43:06,798 --> 00:43:07,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, like everything.

727
00:43:08,012 --> 00:43:11,209
Speaker 0: And then you had the super fake and the current guy until just now.

728
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:11,832
Speaker 0: Yeah.

729
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:17,350
Speaker 0: Daniel Craig, second or third favorite Bond, depending on how I'm feeling.

730
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,550
Speaker 1: I guess he's third after Brosnan and Connery.

731
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:35,190
Speaker 1: But that's the thing that makes the James Bond movies different from all the other sort of franchises, is that there's this that connection where it's like there's an actor who's playing Bond and a set of movies.

732
00:43:35,671 --> 00:43:35,933
Speaker 1: Right.

733
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:38,510
Speaker 1: And, you know, it doesn't matter who all the characters are.

734
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,089
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter what the plots are.

735
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:40,351
Speaker 1: Right.

736
00:43:40,391 --> 00:43:44,230
Speaker 1: It's like the set of movies where that actor was James Bond.

737
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:44,572
Speaker 1: Right.

738
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:48,211
Speaker 1: It's like I don't even know actors names, but I know all the James Bond actors names.

739
00:43:48,372 --> 00:43:48,593
Speaker 1: Right.

740
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:48,955
Speaker 1: It's like.

741
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:52,430
Speaker 1: it's like art are like a set.

742
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:52,771
Speaker 1: Right.

743
00:43:52,811 --> 00:44:05,418
Speaker 1: It's like you don't have fucking like, oh, the Star Wars where, you know, Hamill was Luke and then the Star Wars where Daniel Craig was Luke and the Star Wars where that doesn't look like.

744
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:06,410
Speaker 0: In fact, look what they're doing.

745
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:12,537
Speaker 0: They're using CG to make sure you still have the original player, like character and actor in a role.

746
00:44:12,557 --> 00:44:13,468
Speaker 0: Right.

747
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:17,950
Speaker 1: Whereas James Bond is like, you know, it's like it's unique in that way.

748
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:28,488
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you can think of where there's a character and the person who plays that character is sort of, you know, there's the there's the.

749
00:44:28,548 --> 00:44:29,552
Speaker 1: I don't know how to describe it.

750
00:44:29,572 --> 00:44:29,833
Speaker 1: There's

751
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:51,610
Speaker 0: this similar but distinct thing that you see, especially in some anime where like Lupin anime or I don't know it the where you have the same character mostly drawn the same way, but even played by the same voice actor, possibly, but radically reinterpreted by whoever's writing and directing each movie.

752
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,690
Speaker 1: I do think you see a little bit of it on, you know, on the theater.

753
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:57,212
Speaker 1: Right.

754
00:44:57,253 --> 00:44:58,230
Speaker 1: Stage Broadway.

755
00:44:58,451 --> 00:44:58,732
Speaker 1: Right.

756
00:44:58,752 --> 00:45:03,570
Speaker 1: Because you'll have you know, you'll have a play and it's an original cast.

757
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:04,194
Speaker 1: Right.

758
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:06,150
Speaker 1: So and so plays the main character.

759
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:06,592
Speaker 1: Right.

760
00:45:07,094 --> 00:45:12,196
Speaker 1: And then obviously the play has to be shown internationally in other languages and other places.

761
00:45:12,236 --> 00:45:14,450
Speaker 1: It goes on tour and you have a different cast.

762
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:15,692
Speaker 1: Right.

763
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:21,049
Speaker 1: The person that the famous person stops being the main character, someone else takes over on Broadway for the extended run.

764
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:27,089
Speaker 0: But they tend not to radically reinterpret the role unless the production itself is radically reinterpreting the role.

765
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:27,831
Speaker 1: Exactly.

766
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:34,270
Speaker 1: That's the difference is that when you do that with a with a play, it's still the same script, the same story.

767
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,033
Speaker 1: That's like this.

768
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:39,795
Speaker 1: It's like if they just made Thunderball over and over and over again with a different James Bond.

769
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:40,699
Speaker 1: But this it's like.

770
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:47,490
Speaker 1: it's, you know, the same character, the same universe with different stories, but the same, quote, universe.

771
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:55,490
Speaker 0: It's like the lazy Matsumoto verse in that you can't actually make a very clear, good connection between every single movie.

772
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:57,290
Speaker 0: That's 100, not every single movie.

773
00:45:57,451 --> 00:46:00,369
Speaker 1: But there are some that you can connect to.

774
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,890
Speaker 1: There are some that fit together.

775
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,171
Speaker 1: Yeah.

776
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:08,548
Speaker 0: Well, like all the Daniel Craig ones literally are just a progression, like they all just are sequels to each other.

777
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:10,433
Speaker 1: Exactly.

778
00:46:10,453 --> 00:46:16,610
Speaker 1: And there's there are like some that like involve, you know, Specter, like some Sean Connery ones and whatever that sort of go together a little bit.

779
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,470
Speaker 0: Well, they'll bring common elements together.

780
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:26,650
Speaker 0: Like they'll always be a money, like they'll always be these elements in the movies, but they might act very differently, be portrayed very differently, serve different roles.

781
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:35,789
Speaker 0: James Bond films always seem to try to do one twist in each movie that wasn't like what you expected from a previous movie to the point that you wait for.

782
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:37,450
Speaker 0: Like, where's the Bond twist?

783
00:46:41,336 --> 00:46:57,674
Speaker 1: But, yeah, so I guess, you know, what makes James Bond right, regardless of who the actor is, right, you know, and regardless of, you know, what flavor is being put on it, I think what makes it fun is that, you know, you get a little bit of everything no matter what.

784
00:46:57,735 --> 00:46:57,976
Speaker 1: Right.

785
00:46:58,057 --> 00:46:59,709
Speaker 1: It's like you get you get action.

786
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:04,890
Speaker 0: Usually there's a pretty big action scene in the first five minutes of the movie.

787
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:11,035
Speaker 1: Usually it's usually it's that the best action in the cold open movie is going to be the chase scene.

788
00:47:11,136 --> 00:47:11,378
Speaker 1: Right.

789
00:47:11,439 --> 00:47:12,710
Speaker 1: It always starts with action.

790
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:23,209
Speaker 0: That's why I was such a big fan of Daniel Craig, because when they brought him onto the scene, Casino Royale, first scene in media rez chase scene, almost like a James Bond movie is going to start with that.

791
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,256
Speaker 1: Almost right.

792
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:27,764
Speaker 1: And that the chase scenes are not all.

793
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:31,950
Speaker 1: there's plenty of car chases, no shortage, but there's not just car chases.

794
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:32,352
Speaker 1: Right.

795
00:47:32,773 --> 00:47:36,850
Speaker 1: You get, you know, the skiing chases are really incredible.

796
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:37,853
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

797
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:38,677
Speaker 1: Were they?

798
00:47:38,737 --> 00:47:39,522
Speaker 1: I don't even know they might.

799
00:47:39,562 --> 00:47:42,730
Speaker 1: were they the first some of the earliest slash best ski chases.

800
00:47:42,931 --> 00:47:43,092
Speaker 1: Right.

801
00:47:43,132 --> 00:47:48,130
Speaker 0: I mean, some of the best scenes in Inception were the ski chases because they were very Bond movie like.

802
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:49,255
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

803
00:47:49,335 --> 00:47:51,710
Speaker 1: Total, total Bond ski chases there.

804
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:52,312
Speaker 1: Right.

805
00:47:53,176 --> 00:47:56,570
Speaker 1: So different kinds of chases you got going on a lot of boats going on.

806
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:57,174
Speaker 1: Right.

807
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,210
Speaker 1: A lot of swimming and all kinds of stuff.

808
00:47:59,693 --> 00:47:59,894
Speaker 1: Right.

809
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:02,270
Speaker 1: I remember, you know, Live and Let Die.

810
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:02,833
Speaker 1: Right.

811
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:05,770
Speaker 1: Which is not a not a good one, but it's like my favorite one.

812
00:48:05,932 --> 00:48:07,249
Speaker 1: It has good aspects, at least.

813
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,947
Speaker 1: I can recognize first Roger Moore one.

814
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:10,592
Speaker 1: Right.

815
00:48:11,136 --> 00:48:12,810
Speaker 1: First time it was the first Roger Moore.

816
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:13,679
Speaker 1: One was Roger Moore.

817
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:23,330
Speaker 1: You know, even though I like Sean Connery better than Roger Moore, Live and Let Die is like, you know, because there's the campy chase scene.

818
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:23,892
Speaker 1: Right.

819
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:29,940
Speaker 1: We have the boats and the cars and the ridiculous, you know, racist Southern cop guy.

820
00:48:29,961 --> 00:48:30,042
Speaker 1: Yeah.

821
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:31,713
Speaker 1: And it's like.

822
00:48:32,134 --> 00:48:36,330
Speaker 1: it's like the three way chase between Bond, the cops and the bad guys.

823
00:48:36,571 --> 00:48:36,832
Speaker 1: Right.

824
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:41,213
Speaker 1: And it's got, you know, like the hovercraft going over the road to the other side.

825
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:54,688
Speaker 1: You know, it's like that's a really good, you know, that's almost I'd say that like in terms of, you know, comedy car chases and movies from Hollywood, it's like Blues Brothers one, Live and Let Die two.

826
00:48:55,372 --> 00:48:58,290
Speaker 0: I believe that maybe number three is obviously Blues Brothers.

827
00:48:58,391 --> 00:48:59,399
Speaker 1: Way ahead.

828
00:48:59,499 --> 00:49:00,789
Speaker 1: Number one, not even close.

829
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:03,932
Speaker 1: Yeah.

830
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:05,889
Speaker 1: So you get you get stuff like that.

831
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:09,050
Speaker 1: You get the comedy is always there in some aspects.

832
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,789
Speaker 0: That's something a lot of people like.

833
00:49:11,272 --> 00:49:14,610
Speaker 0: I don't like the Pierce Brosnan movies because they just they feel really fakie.

834
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,910
Speaker 0: But don't get me wrong.

835
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:19,870
Speaker 0: They are funny and I appreciate that.

836
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:28,013
Speaker 0: And some of the people who are mad about some later James Bond movies, they try to argue that, well, they're too funny or they're too like there's too much comedy injected.

837
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:35,771
Speaker 0: But there's always been comedy that comes from the people who complain about the politics in Star Trek, in these newer Star Trek's like, what were you watching?

838
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:49,190
Speaker 1: And then, you know, you have this mix going on where you sort of have the, you know, you know, serious spy stuff, right?

839
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:56,790
Speaker 0: Like, you know, try to stop, you know, Cold War stuff, you know, the plots are actually kind of stupid and fakie.

840
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:03,648
Speaker 0: There's always right, like megalomaniac, like exactly villain or this ridiculous magic weapon.

841
00:50:04,313 --> 00:50:05,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's something on the man.

842
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:16,910
Speaker 1: It's a mad scientist, science fiction villain mixed with the real world, you know, dictator, evil communists or whatever.

843
00:50:17,231 --> 00:50:17,854
Speaker 1: Right.

844
00:50:17,955 --> 00:50:21,290
Speaker 1: Autocrat, you know, villains like combined into one.

845
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:21,992
Speaker 1: Right.

846
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:29,370
Speaker 1: So it pulls the wacky mad scientist down a bit to where it's not just, you know, nonsense.

847
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:30,250
Speaker 1: Right.

848
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:40,950
Speaker 1: But it makes what would otherwise be like a really sort of uninteresting, boring, like a Tinker Tailor soldier's spy kind of spy thing.

849
00:50:41,312 --> 00:50:41,614
Speaker 1: Right.

850
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:43,788
Speaker 1: And makes it more fun.

851
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:51,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, because real spying would be more like, all right, he's dressed like a nerd and just quietly living in the city for a month writing things down.

852
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's exciting.

853
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:59,729
Speaker 1: And then on top of all that, you have these sort of Bond, you know, taglines.

854
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:01,182
Speaker 1: don't have a cow man stirred.

855
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:03,011
Speaker 1: Right.

856
00:51:03,332 --> 00:51:07,670
Speaker 1: You know, Q with a funny gadget and a car that shoots a missile.

857
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:08,132
Speaker 1: Right.

858
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:19,510
Speaker 1: The tropes and cliches, you know, that are, you know, they bring, you know, familiarity, nostalgia, fun, you know, whatever, to connect them all together.

859
00:51:19,711 --> 00:51:28,450
Speaker 0: Like if you've seen a few Bond movies and then you watch any random Bond movie, something in it will evoke specific memories from those other Bond movies.

860
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:34,210
Speaker 0: Pick any three and you'll find connections between them like, oh, yeah, they all had a Gatling gun in the headlights of his car.

861
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:35,237
Speaker 0: All three of them did.

862
00:51:35,278 --> 00:51:36,850
Speaker 0: Like, you'll always find something.

863
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:43,630
Speaker 1: If you made if you tried to make some other movie and you did any of those things, like you've had a car with an ejector seat, right?

864
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:47,809
Speaker 1: Someone's going to be like, that's a, you know, James Bond rip off right there.

865
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:48,392
Speaker 1: Yeah.

866
00:51:48,612 --> 00:52:06,050
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, there are movies with cars and ejector seats, but but, you know, you just can't help but think of James Bond when you see that, because even if they weren't the first to do it, it's like it's like they just have ownership over, you know, some of those those things like that in some way.

867
00:52:06,472 --> 00:52:13,070
Speaker 0: I think it's worth pointing out that one aspect of Bond films that I personally appreciate, even though there's such a tiny part.

868
00:52:14,112 --> 00:52:19,150
Speaker 0: I mean, the music is fine, like they have their motif that they use, but specifically the opening credits in Bond.

869
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:23,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's that's one of that's one of the nostalgia, you know, things, right.

870
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:27,690
Speaker 1: And they always they always open every James Bond movie.

871
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:30,190
Speaker 1: You know, you get the end media res action scene.

872
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:30,515
Speaker 1: Yeah.

873
00:52:31,046 --> 00:52:31,250
Speaker 1: Right.

874
00:52:31,692 --> 00:52:33,927
Speaker 1: And then it goes, you know, right.

875
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:38,549
Speaker 1: It comes across the thing right with the shoots, the screen, right.

876
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:52,364
Speaker 1: The blood comes down and then there's always the opening is always some sort of really artistic, you know, thing with lots of like silhouettes of naked people swimming and some song playing.

877
00:52:52,384 --> 00:52:52,485
Speaker 1: Right.

878
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,369
Speaker 1: It's always a song for the movie.

879
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,350
Speaker 1: The title of the song is the name of the movie.

880
00:52:57,032 --> 00:52:57,253
Speaker 1: Right.

881
00:52:57,536 --> 00:52:59,470
Speaker 1: One time, I think they got Madonna due to the song.

882
00:52:59,590 --> 00:52:59,912
Speaker 1: Right.

883
00:52:59,932 --> 00:53:03,550
Speaker 1: You know, it's always some big time song they pay to have made just for the movie.

884
00:53:04,331 --> 00:53:13,750
Speaker 0: I haven't seen some of the older bonds in a while, but I think the best opening sequence I can remember from any Bond movie is actually from Skyfall, even though Skyfall itself.

885
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,370
Speaker 0: the entire end of that movie is absolutely stupid.

886
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:22,370
Speaker 1: I mean, I can't remember which opening goes with which movies, so I can't really.

887
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:27,210
Speaker 0: It's not a particularly good song and a particularly good like the theme.

888
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:31,569
Speaker 0: It was a card theme that all the Daniel Craig movies have a similar sort of theming to them.

889
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:40,986
Speaker 1: But the point is, it's you know, if you want to talk about which just the songs alone again, live and let die is a song that you will listen to.

890
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:46,730
Speaker 1: No one's going to put on you only live twice, like just because they want to listen to that.

891
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:50,310
Speaker 0: I am confident there are people who just listen to someone.

892
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,073
Speaker 1: Well, right.

893
00:53:51,113 --> 00:53:54,190
Speaker 1: But, you know, live and let die is like it's like Paul McCartney wings.

894
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:54,572
Speaker 1: Right.

895
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:57,129
Speaker 1: It's like, you know.

896
00:54:00,473 --> 00:54:01,910
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I guess what else is there to say?

897
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,830
Speaker 1: Like some of the best ones, right?

898
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:07,570
Speaker 1: If I say not, you know, I already said my favorite one is live and let die.

899
00:54:07,691 --> 00:54:07,851
Speaker 1: Right.

900
00:54:07,972 --> 00:54:11,210
Speaker 1: Best ones are going to be, you know, Thunderball.

901
00:54:11,633 --> 00:54:12,459
Speaker 1: Is really up there.

902
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,567
Speaker 1: It's probably number one.

903
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:20,427
Speaker 0: Thunderball's got a lot of very pack, like specifically tense scenes, especially when I was young and I hadn't seen a lot of James Bond movies yet.

904
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,619
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

905
00:54:24,624 --> 00:54:25,750
Speaker 1: Let's let me look at a list of them.

906
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,995
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just found a list.

907
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:30,210
Speaker 1: I'm trying to remember which one is which and miss one.

908
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:30,710
Speaker 1: Right.

909
00:54:32,417 --> 00:54:35,890
Speaker 1: I could just go down the list of ones we've seen and briefly comment.

910
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:40,188
Speaker 0: I had not seen Moonraker until I played the N64 game.

911
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:42,650
Speaker 0: And there was the Moonraker laser.

912
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,490
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, I guess I should see that James Bond movie.

913
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:52,830
Speaker 1: Moonraker is fun for it's like if you're a kid, it's like super fun because it's all in space with lasers and Jaws and all that great stuff.

914
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:59,890
Speaker 1: I actually had like some collectible Moonraker cards, like trading cards, which had photos from the movie printed on them.

915
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,830
Speaker 1: But not really a great movie.

916
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:04,441
Speaker 1: Think about it.

917
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:09,190
Speaker 0: License to kill is the is the Timothy Dalton one I saw.

918
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,749
Speaker 0: I never saw the living daylights.

919
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:12,457
Speaker 1: That one has the best title.

920
00:55:13,742 --> 00:55:16,114
Speaker 1: license to kill is the best title because that's one of the sticks.

921
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:16,336
Speaker 1: Right.

922
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:17,610
Speaker 1: Sean Connery is a license to kill.

923
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,709
Speaker 1: That's how come you can just go around shooting bad guys and not worry about it.

924
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:23,030
Speaker 0: That was a fun thing about Casino Royale.

925
00:55:23,131 --> 00:55:26,007
Speaker 0: That opening scene is him just murdering a dude to get his 007 license.

926
00:55:27,152 --> 00:55:27,313
Speaker 1: Yeah.

927
00:55:28,018 --> 00:55:29,570
Speaker 1: I like you only live twice a lot.

928
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:29,811
Speaker 1: Right.

929
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:34,395
Speaker 1: Because the whole the whole shtick like, you know, James Bond fakes his death and it's like a whole.

930
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:36,630
Speaker 1: you know, the premise is really good.

931
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:38,197
Speaker 1: Right.

932
00:55:38,257 --> 00:55:39,430
Speaker 1: The man with the golden gun.

933
00:55:39,571 --> 00:55:40,053
Speaker 1: I don't know.

934
00:55:40,113 --> 00:55:43,369
Speaker 1: You know, it has that sort of Paradise Island thing going on.

935
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:43,991
Speaker 1: Right.

936
00:55:44,031 --> 00:55:46,945
Speaker 0: I worry it doesn't hold up that well as a movie like it.

937
00:55:46,985 --> 00:55:48,333
Speaker 0: just it's a little too slow.

938
00:55:48,615 --> 00:55:50,810
Speaker 1: It's like he's going after the man with three nipples.

939
00:55:51,171 --> 00:55:51,474
Speaker 1: Right.

940
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:53,428
Speaker 1: But it's like, again, that's just really fun.

941
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,550
Speaker 1: You know, shades of Goldfinger.

942
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:55,832
Speaker 1: Right.

943
00:55:56,235 --> 00:55:58,290
Speaker 1: Somehow the bad guy is involved with gold.

944
00:55:58,591 --> 00:55:58,812
Speaker 1: Right.

945
00:55:58,852 --> 00:55:59,495
Speaker 1: In some way.

946
00:55:59,716 --> 00:56:03,316
Speaker 0: Well, that's because there's these recurring stories, this recurring arcs.

947
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:04,410
Speaker 1: Yep.

948
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,766
Speaker 0: Like no time to die is all about.

949
00:56:06,786 --> 00:56:07,069
Speaker 0: Guess what?

950
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:07,555
Speaker 0: Specter.

951
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:08,870
Speaker 1: Yeah.

952
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:11,829
Speaker 0: And Blofeld and Blofeld and like all that nonsense is back.

953
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:14,252
Speaker 1: Yep.

954
00:56:14,573 --> 00:56:18,389
Speaker 1: I guess Octopussy has that whole like, you know, the island vibe going on.

955
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,095
Speaker 1: Yeah.

956
00:56:19,135 --> 00:56:19,748
Speaker 1: Setting right.

957
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:20,071
Speaker 1: That's.

958
00:56:20,091 --> 00:56:23,890
Speaker 1: the other thing is that the James Bond movies always have like a different international setting.

959
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:27,088
Speaker 1: There's a lot of traveling going on between locales.

960
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:28,655
Speaker 1: All right.

961
00:56:28,695 --> 00:56:29,588
Speaker 1: The Fabergé egg.

962
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:30,771
Speaker 1: Right.

963
00:56:31,094 --> 00:56:32,710
Speaker 1: James Bond is like super worldly.

964
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:35,081
Speaker 1: He's going all over the place to do his spy.

965
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:46,850
Speaker 1: different countries, you know, and you get to see architecture and, you know, the, you know, local markets and, you know, industrial places that you get to see just a lot of stuff in these movies.

966
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,790
Speaker 1: You know, you get some of the fun that you get by actually traveling the world.

967
00:56:52,312 --> 00:56:55,230
Speaker 1: You sort of feel that a little bit when you watch pretty much any one of these.

968
00:56:55,370 --> 00:57:00,450
Speaker 1: I don't think there are any that take place like strictly like in like London only.

969
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:02,130
Speaker 1: It's like he only goes to London.

970
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,497
Speaker 1: It's like go to the like.

971
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:04,262
Speaker 1: there's any.

972
00:57:04,302 --> 00:57:07,650
Speaker 1: you know, I can't remember if you actually I used to do any do any spying there.

973
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:08,950
Speaker 1: It's usually somewhere else.

974
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:09,091
Speaker 1: Yeah.

975
00:57:09,131 --> 00:57:11,550
Speaker 0: Bond wouldn't work as like a one room play.

976
00:57:12,271 --> 00:57:14,729
Speaker 0: Like no, no, no story they tell could work like that.

977
00:57:15,512 --> 00:57:17,810
Speaker 0: It's always like, oh, we figured out the problem in London.

978
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,586
Speaker 0: Now we've got to go to Jakarta to meet the guy to do the thing.

979
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:26,290
Speaker 1: I forget which one it was.

980
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:31,609
Speaker 1: Was it Tomorrow Never Dies or was it The World Is Not Enough that had...

981
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:32,585
Speaker 0: What happens in it?

982
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:40,770
Speaker 0: Because I watch most of the older ones, all the Roger Moore ones, I mostly watch on my grandparents giant projection TV when I was young.

983
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,530
Speaker 1: It was it was The World Is Not Enough.

984
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,670
Speaker 1: And all I could remember from The World Is Not Enough, 1999.

985
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's I don't think I saw that one.

986
00:57:47,871 --> 00:58:04,740
Speaker 1: All I remember from that is that Denise Richards, who is really hot, like, wow, there's always which is the other aspect of Bond movies that perhaps, you know, especially the older ones that does not hold up so well is Extreme Misogyny and Male Gaze.

987
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,279
Speaker 1: There's always several Bond ladies going on.

988
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:09,148
Speaker 1: Yeah.

989
00:58:09,168 --> 00:58:09,270
Speaker 1: Right.

990
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,740
Speaker 1: The fact that they're even called Bond ladies as if tells you everything.

991
00:58:13,441 --> 00:58:21,439
Speaker 0: So later Bond property, later Bond movies would try to either poke fun at that concept or invert it with varying degrees of success.

992
00:58:22,304 --> 00:58:24,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, not in 1999.

993
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,383
Speaker 1: They weren't.

994
00:58:24,464 --> 00:58:26,520
Speaker 0: No, but like no time to die.

995
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:39,968
Speaker 0: It was interesting because Bond meets a Bond woman at the point in a Bond movie where there would be that scene and she sits down and she takes off her wig and she starts undressing a little bit.

996
00:58:39,988 --> 00:58:41,100
Speaker 0: And he's like, you're moving fast.

997
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:43,359
Speaker 0: And she's like, well, this is how you normally do, don't you?

998
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,479
Speaker 0: Hi, I'm the 007 like they just inverted on him.

999
00:58:46,882 --> 00:58:49,080
Speaker 0: Then he meets another woman who he thinks is a Bond woman.

1000
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,420
Speaker 0: She's a CIA agent.

1001
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,620
Speaker 0: Every woman he meets is as skilled as him and is trying to trick him to do something.

1002
00:58:54,761 --> 00:59:02,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, there were examples of that in older movies where the, you know, the Bond woman wasn't just some like, you know, do nothing.

1003
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,645
Speaker 0: But you just said it was.

1004
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:04,749
Speaker 0: it was always a wasn't.

1005
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:08,134
Speaker 0: just like they'd have one exactly quality one.

1006
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:08,781
Speaker 0: Right.

1007
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:09,423
Speaker 1: There would be.

1008
00:59:09,604 --> 00:59:14,181
Speaker 1: there would be women who were capable spies, you know, on their own.

1009
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:14,462
Speaker 1: Right.

1010
00:59:14,543 --> 00:59:20,640
Speaker 1: Strong and active and CIA agents or, you know, other aid, you know, cooperating agents of some kind.

1011
00:59:21,042 --> 00:59:24,659
Speaker 1: But there was still a sexual element to it.

1012
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:25,182
Speaker 1: Right.

1013
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:27,431
Speaker 1: You know that it's like.

1014
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:31,299
Speaker 1: it's like, yeah, she's going to help me shoot some bad guys and then we're going to get it on.

1015
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:31,882
Speaker 1: Right.

1016
00:59:32,203 --> 00:59:38,339
Speaker 1: It was like, you know, or I'll be sad that she's dead and get it on with the one who's still alive at the end.

1017
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:38,681
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1018
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:46,560
Speaker 1: I mean, a lot of James Bond movies end with James Bond getting it on in a train or a boat as the camera pulls away.

1019
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:47,483
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1020
00:59:47,704 --> 00:59:49,008
Speaker 0: They also.

1021
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:53,739
Speaker 0: the first third has him get it on with the first Bond woman who then dies and drives him into the plot.

1022
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:54,821
Speaker 1: Yep.

1023
00:59:55,643 --> 01:00:04,920
Speaker 1: So, you know, that that element of save and bang the girl is is there and is probably, I guess, the least good part.

1024
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:12,360
Speaker 0: Well, you know, if you want to see what like if you remove this because James Bond movies, they weren't all great.

1025
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:16,300
Speaker 0: Like, I enjoy them, but a lot of them are not great movies.

1026
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,399
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I don't think, you know, even the you know, it's like, OK, I said Thunderball was the best one.

1027
01:00:20,823 --> 01:00:22,100
Speaker 1: Agree or disagree, whatever.

1028
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:22,401
Speaker 1: Right.

1029
01:00:22,421 --> 01:00:24,260
Speaker 0: It's not on my top ten movie list.

1030
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:31,340
Speaker 1: Thunderball deserves to win the best Oscar picture in the best picture Oscar in no year.

1031
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,697
Speaker 1: There is no year in which Thunderball is the best picture against any.

1032
01:00:37,021 --> 01:00:37,302
Speaker 1: Right.

1033
01:00:37,723 --> 01:00:45,700
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, so I feel like if you put that in theaters next to whatever was playing in eighteen ninety nine, you might have won an Oscar if there was an Oscar.

1034
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,880
Speaker 1: Find the year with like the shittiest movies you can find.

1035
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:55,679
Speaker 1: And I guarantee you that whatever won best picture that year that, OK, you know, it might not be that much better than Thunderball, but it's better.

1036
01:00:55,981 --> 01:01:05,013
Speaker 0: But for because they were they were consistent enough and somehow it became an IP that Americans in particular, but also internationally, it became known.

1037
01:01:05,936 --> 01:01:10,740
Speaker 0: not many not as many people remember the Flynn movies, which are basically knockoff bonds.

1038
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:19,564
Speaker 0: And imagine Bond without even this barest hint of self reflection and like adaptation to the times.

1039
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,359
Speaker 0: That's what the Flynn movies are like.

1040
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:30,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, there are plenty of, you know, action movies that focus on one dude who's a spy or agent or cop or.

1041
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:30,661
Speaker 1: Right.

1042
01:01:30,741 --> 01:01:36,955
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, and it's like, you know, like, you know what, you know, some of them continued.

1043
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:37,240
Speaker 1: Right.

1044
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,440
Speaker 1: How many diehards are there or how many lethal weapons are there?

1045
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:41,043
Speaker 1: Right.

1046
01:01:41,063 --> 01:01:42,512
Speaker 1: You know, I guess, you know, they're slightly.

1047
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,433
Speaker 1: they each have their slight differences.

1048
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:44,719
Speaker 1: Right.

1049
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:48,500
Speaker 1: But it's still like there's an action hero in a series.

1050
01:01:48,761 --> 01:01:48,941
Speaker 1: Right.

1051
01:01:50,144 --> 01:01:55,014
Speaker 1: But they weren't able to carry on for, oh, 60 to 40, 60 fucking years plus.

1052
01:01:58,021 --> 01:01:58,362
Speaker 1: Right.

1053
01:01:59,305 --> 01:02:03,699
Speaker 1: That's what as any movie series carried on that long, even close.

1054
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:06,544
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

1055
01:02:06,564 --> 01:02:16,815
Speaker 1: I mean, we could see with the explosion, I guess Star Wars is, I guess, like 10, 20, 10 to 20 years younger, but it has way less movies, way less.

1056
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:21,900
Speaker 1: James Bond is like three or four or five times as many movies as Star Wars does.

1057
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:22,759
Speaker 1: Star Wars is nine.

1058
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:23,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

1059
01:02:23,863 --> 01:02:40,020
Speaker 0: Now what we could see, it'll be really interesting to see if there start to be Bond TV shows or TV movies or streaming things instead of just pure traditional theatrical releases like every other company that owns a long running IP is doing.

1060
01:02:40,563 --> 01:02:42,500
Speaker 1: Well, there was James Bond Junior.

1061
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,259
Speaker 0: There was James Bond Junior.

1062
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:48,360
Speaker 1: And was there I think there's James Pond, I believe.

1063
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,380
Speaker 0: I mean, there's lots of parodies of James Bond.

1064
01:02:52,181 --> 01:02:55,680
Speaker 1: James Pond, underwater agent for the the Sega Genesis.

1065
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:02,600
Speaker 0: I know there were one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine James Bond movies before Star Wars was in theaters.

1066
01:03:02,942 --> 01:03:03,740
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.

1067
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:05,903
Speaker 1: There was.

1068
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:11,594
Speaker 1: I also wonder, right, you know, all these James Bond video games, you know, especially Goldeneye for N64.

1069
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:12,821
Speaker 1: Right.

1070
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:16,704
Speaker 0: But also I think, you know, I make fun of that game because, you know, I had a computer at the time.

1071
01:03:16,865 --> 01:03:30,120
Speaker 0: But if you ignore the fact that, yes, technically there were computer FPS is if you were lucky enough to have a computer back then for most people in that era, Goldeneye was possibly the greatest video game they had ever seen.

1072
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:38,082
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, but it's like if not for Goldeneye, would James Bond have carried on?

1073
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:42,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, because remember, Goldeneye would have been able to make it from the 90s to the 2020s.

1074
01:03:44,341 --> 01:03:51,460
Speaker 0: Well, Goldeneye, because also the movie remember Timothy Dalton might have killed James Bond like after license to kill.

1075
01:03:51,602 --> 01:03:52,740
Speaker 0: That was nineteen eighty nine.

1076
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,460
Speaker 0: Goldeneye was nineteen ninety five.

1077
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:58,540
Speaker 0: You can go read a Wikipedia article on why there weren't Bond movies during that period.

1078
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:00,832
Speaker 0: A lot of it had to do with Bond.

1079
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:02,100
Speaker 0: wasn't that popular anymore.

1080
01:04:02,742 --> 01:04:05,240
Speaker 0: And a lot of people were blaming Timothy Dalton or the writing.

1081
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,940
Speaker 0: There was a lot of debate as to what was going to happen to James Bond.

1082
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,559
Speaker 0: Pierce Brosnan and that franchise, like for whatever reason, nineteen ninety five was the year Bond exploded again.

1083
01:04:16,943 --> 01:04:19,460
Speaker 0: It could just as easily have been a flop and ended Bond.

1084
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:24,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially when you think about like the amazing movies that came out in nineteen ninety five.

1085
01:04:24,951 --> 01:04:25,600
Speaker 1: Right.

1086
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:27,898
Speaker 1: You know, you had.

1087
01:04:30,202 --> 01:04:33,180
Speaker 0: I got to make sure I don't say a nineteen ninety six or nineteen ninety seven movie.

1088
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,347
Speaker 1: No, I think it was not.

1089
01:04:34,407 --> 01:04:36,140
Speaker 1: I think it was ninety four were the good movies.

1090
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:36,241
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1091
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:37,380
Speaker 0: Scott is going to say ninety five.

1092
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,880
Speaker 0: You got Batman forever.

1093
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:39,624
Speaker 0: No, no.

1094
01:04:39,705 --> 01:04:41,020
Speaker 1: Ninety four was the Rangers.

1095
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:42,401
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1096
01:04:42,843 --> 01:04:45,400
Speaker 1: Oh, Johnny, I think it was ninety three and ninety four.

1097
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,450
Speaker 1: So I guess maybe that's what happened.

1098
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:51,039
Speaker 1: is that, you know, in ninety three, ninety four, all those good movies came out.

1099
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:51,723
Speaker 1: Right.

1100
01:04:52,245 --> 01:04:55,600
Speaker 1: And then, you know, people are, you know, big on movies.

1101
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,820
Speaker 0: And then in ninety five, there's less Ventura to the net.

1102
01:05:00,467 --> 01:05:01,320
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, twelve monkeys.

1103
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:06,200
Speaker 1: OK, it's not like every movie was good, you know, or bad.

1104
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,258
Speaker 0: Twelve Monkeys was good.

1105
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,065
Speaker 0: Billy Madison was good.

1106
01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:14,962
Speaker 0: by a very narrow definition of it's the second best Adam Sandler movie.

1107
01:05:16,408 --> 01:05:21,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but like ninety three and ninety four were like some of the biggest movie years ever.

1108
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:22,183
Speaker 0: Right.

1109
01:05:22,203 --> 01:05:24,719
Speaker 0: Tommy Boy, ninety five and a lot of movies that I remember.

1110
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:28,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, I made you say you were the right age then.

1111
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:36,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was an era when I was still going to the theater a lot and I had a lot of free time and I saw a lot of these movies in the theater.

1112
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:46,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess if ninety five had had weaker competition, seven, the Brady Bunch, Crimson Tide, The First Night, Waterworld.

1113
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:48,425
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe that.

1114
01:05:48,465 --> 01:05:52,020
Speaker 1: maybe it was timing that helped out to Goldeneye there a bit as well.

1115
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:52,583
Speaker 1: Who knows?

1116
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:54,479
Speaker 0: A lot of big blockbusters in that time.

1117
01:05:55,461 --> 01:05:59,840
Speaker 0: Also, there's a lot going on then, but also it was a reimagining of James Bond.

1118
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,413
Speaker 0: It turned him into a wizard, which at least worked like.

1119
01:06:03,453 --> 01:06:08,260
Speaker 0: that was an era when movie effects were getting better and they could pull off crazier effects.

1120
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:17,220
Speaker 0: You got to say as much as I don't like Pierce Brosnan Bond movies, the action scenes are a lot tighter than the Sean Connery action scenes.

1121
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:26,099
Speaker 0: If you watch a Sean Connery Bond movie on a modern 4K screen, like a Blu-ray of it, the effects don't look great.

1122
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:48,320
Speaker 1: Well, for the time, though, it's I think, you know, the James Bond movies in terms of Hollywood effects and production occupy this place where, you know, they're not at the absolute Star Wars pushing the boundaries of what can be done right with with cameras and, you know, technology, computers.

1123
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:48,882
Speaker 1: Right.

1124
01:06:49,284 --> 01:06:52,240
Speaker 1: But what they are is high, high budget.

1125
01:06:52,604 --> 01:06:53,960
Speaker 1: They always have a lot of money.

1126
01:06:54,141 --> 01:06:57,580
Speaker 0: They were doing the best they could do for that era for like that.

1127
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:04,000
Speaker 1: Showing you like the best of what can be done with the established right stuff.

1128
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:04,462
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1129
01:07:04,482 --> 01:07:08,780
Speaker 0: Like if you think a car, if you watch a Sean Connery car chase and you're like, that wasn't that great.

1130
01:07:08,841 --> 01:07:09,940
Speaker 0: I could see the rear projection.

1131
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:15,239
Speaker 0: Go watch any other car related scene from any movie released in that same year.

1132
01:07:17,484 --> 01:07:17,725
Speaker 1: Yep.

1133
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:19,652
Speaker 1: So, you know, that's it's like it's always.

1134
01:07:19,712 --> 01:07:26,438
Speaker 1: it's like a showcase of like, you know, not some, you know, push the the art form forward deal.

1135
01:07:27,361 --> 01:07:41,300
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, take the established right techniques that we and equipment and technology that you already have and just throw money at them, do it the best that it can be done by the book that's already been invented.

1136
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:41,882
Speaker 1: Right.

1137
01:07:41,902 --> 01:07:44,339
Speaker 1: So James Bond wouldn't do like a Tron.

1138
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:45,304
Speaker 1: Right.

1139
01:07:45,325 --> 01:07:45,920
Speaker 1: Right.

1140
01:07:46,522 --> 01:07:46,784
Speaker 1: C.G.

1141
01:07:46,845 --> 01:07:48,480
Speaker 1: before it's good ideal.

1142
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:57,820
Speaker 0: I guess the way it feels is if you watch original Star Wars movies, the lightsaber fights are like they work, but they're not great.

1143
01:07:58,663 --> 01:08:00,880
Speaker 0: Like just the way the actors move.

1144
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:01,644
Speaker 1: They were great.

1145
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:03,680
Speaker 1: If you watch them, then they were.

1146
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,180
Speaker 0: But they weren't even anything better.

1147
01:08:05,341 --> 01:08:10,160
Speaker 0: But they weren't even great by like sword fighting from contemporary movies standards.

1148
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,260
Speaker 1: What you know about sword fighting.

1149
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,483
Speaker 0: True, true.

1150
01:08:14,065 --> 01:08:18,654
Speaker 0: But like watch, I don't know, Obi Wan's fight with Darth Vader and then immediately watch.

1151
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:19,059
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1152
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:20,618
Speaker 1: That's like the weakest one.

1153
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,182
Speaker 0: It is.

1154
01:08:21,443 --> 01:08:24,100
Speaker 0: But then but but that's also the best Star Wars movie.

1155
01:08:26,362 --> 01:08:31,301
Speaker 0: So watch that and then watch, I don't know, Yoda fighting someone from a later Star Wars movie.

1156
01:08:31,823 --> 01:08:35,037
Speaker 0: And you can see a lot of differences and you can make a lot of comparisons.

1157
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:45,299
Speaker 0: and the just the cinematography science is not quite as tight in the old movie in terms of like how to make the action scene look actiony.

1158
01:08:45,884 --> 01:08:47,120
Speaker 0: But it's still a good scene.

1159
01:08:47,483 --> 01:08:49,660
Speaker 0: And that's what I would say about the old Sean Connery bonds.

1160
01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:58,620
Speaker 0: Like there's still even if you can see he's clearly driving in a fake car with the rear projection, the scene still like pulls you in.

1161
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:02,238
Speaker 0: You still like kind of forget that and start to be like, oh, shit.

1162
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:12,841
Speaker 0: When like he takes a sharp corner, the the the plausible like your body and your brain will agree that it is still a compelling scene despite seeing the seams around the edges.

1163
01:09:13,765 --> 01:09:16,819
Speaker 0: That is the most high compliment I can give to old Bond movies.

1164
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,078
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, consider this.

1165
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:19,321
Speaker 1: Right.

1166
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:21,515
Speaker 1: So Thunderball came out in sixty five.

1167
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:22,844
Speaker 1: Right.

1168
01:09:23,185 --> 01:09:24,819
Speaker 1: And he's got the scene with the jet pack.

1169
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:25,202
Speaker 1: Right.

1170
01:09:25,282 --> 01:09:28,559
Speaker 1: And it's like by today's standards, it's you know, it's OK.

1171
01:09:28,962 --> 01:09:31,200
Speaker 1: I can see what you did, how you made the jet pack happen.

1172
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:34,100
Speaker 0: I mean, the rocket here was in nineteen ninety one.

1173
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,580
Speaker 0: And that jet pack scene does not look that much better.

1174
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:37,721
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.

1175
01:09:37,944 --> 01:09:41,080
Speaker 1: But also look at other movies from nineteen sixty five.

1176
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:41,402
Speaker 1: Right.

1177
01:09:41,462 --> 01:09:42,460
Speaker 1: Like sci fi movies.

1178
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:42,921
Speaker 1: Like what?

1179
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:46,600
Speaker 1: I've never seen any of these that I just googled up.

1180
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:47,180
Speaker 1: Right.

1181
01:09:47,301 --> 01:09:54,247
Speaker 1: But, you know, Nightcrawler from outer space, I guess, you know, it's like crack of the world.

1182
01:09:54,309 --> 01:09:55,319
Speaker 1: I even know what that's about.

1183
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,400
Speaker 1: Voyage to the prehistoric planet.

1184
01:09:57,581 --> 01:10:00,980
Speaker 1: It's like those are probably even more hackneyed looking.

1185
01:10:01,343 --> 01:10:03,020
Speaker 0: Hey, Frankenstein meets the space monster.

1186
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:14,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to hazard a guess and say that those are not pulling off the, you know, the dude in a dude in a costume or whatever thing, you know, very well.

1187
01:10:16,525 --> 01:10:16,565
Speaker 0: So.

1188
01:10:16,585 --> 01:10:24,619
Speaker 0: But yeah, what I guess I actually of all the James Bonds, I have enjoyed watching the Daniel Craig ones that I watched, which is only three of them.

1189
01:10:25,363 --> 01:10:30,323
Speaker 0: And now after the show, I have this weird urge to go back and watch some older Bond movies.

1190
01:10:30,343 --> 01:10:36,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like, you know, it would not be a waste of time, even if some of these, you know, are not the greatest.

1191
01:10:36,342 --> 01:10:36,566
Speaker 1: Right.

1192
01:10:36,606 --> 01:10:37,480
Speaker 1: Like Timothy Dalton.

1193
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:38,022
Speaker 1: Right.

1194
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:40,000
Speaker 0: Some of these I just have like Timothy Dalton.

1195
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:44,220
Speaker 0: I remember this long scene with a helicopter and literally nothing else.

1196
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:48,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like it's really, you know, well, I said none of these are Oscar winners.

1197
01:10:49,142 --> 01:10:49,954
Speaker 1: Maybe some of them are.

1198
01:10:49,994 --> 01:10:50,319
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1199
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,680
Speaker 1: But I feel like it's not a waste of time to watch all of them.

1200
01:10:54,740 --> 01:11:01,081
Speaker 1: Really, you know, maybe maybe I'll go back and catch up on, you know, whatever I want.

1201
01:11:01,162 --> 01:11:01,684
Speaker 0: You know what?

1202
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:05,884
Speaker 0: You could get away with watching the first one that each actor made because.

1203
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:09,399
Speaker 0: They tend to be pretty similar.

1204
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:14,079
Speaker 0: Like the Sean Connery Bond movies didn't change that much from beginning to end.

1205
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:18,958
Speaker 0: From what I remember, I have not seen Dr.

1206
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:19,541
Speaker 0: No.

1207
01:11:21,207 --> 01:11:24,959
Speaker 0: Since I watched it on a TV at my grandma's house.

1208
01:11:26,541 --> 01:11:27,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dr.

1209
01:11:27,084 --> 01:11:28,390
Speaker 1: No, you know, is one of those.

1210
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:31,236
Speaker 1: it's, you know, it's more mad scientisty if you couldn't tell by the title.

1211
01:11:31,298 --> 01:11:31,440
Speaker 1: Right.

1212
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,579
Speaker 1: It's, you know, it's with that the rocket at the end.

1213
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:37,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like that's that's, you know, that for a kid, at least that makes it real exciting.

1214
01:11:37,905 --> 01:11:40,320
Speaker 1: You know, the same way that Moonraker is exciting for a kid.

1215
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,482
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1216
01:11:42,324 --> 01:11:50,580
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, yeah, James Bond, I think, you know, you know, it's a unique, you know, other big media property.

1217
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,419
Speaker 1: I think it's unique in a lot of ways.

1218
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:55,640
Speaker 1: It has positive and redeeming aspects.

1219
01:11:55,862 --> 01:11:57,920
Speaker 1: It has bad aspects.

1220
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:02,077
Speaker 1: But I guess, you know, whether we want it to or not, it's going to.

1221
01:12:02,138 --> 01:12:06,441
Speaker 1: they're going to keep making it as long as people keep putting money behind it and people keep going to see it.

1222
01:12:07,164 --> 01:12:11,642
Speaker 1: And I think the only thing that could really kill it is if, you know, newer is interest.

1223
01:12:11,822 --> 01:12:16,959
Speaker 1: Oh, if older generations die and newer generations don't pick up on it.

1224
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:32,497
Speaker 1: You know, I guess if you didn't have a mom who is a super James Bond fan putting it on all the time and you happen to also like it or if you haven't seen any, you probably I would recommend that you do.

1225
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,321
Speaker 1: It's it's.

1226
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:39,262
Speaker 1: you know, it's not as worth your time as watching legendary movies of, you know, the greatest.

1227
01:12:39,403 --> 01:12:46,820
Speaker 1: But, you know, your life is, you know, it's short, but it's long enough that you've got time to watch some James Bond.

1228
01:12:51,943 --> 01:12:54,080

Speaker 0: I think we have enough in the hopper, though we'll have forgotten, as is Geek Nights tradition, every possible opening bit, every possible anecdote, whatever you just got from this episode.

1242
01:14:06,793 --> 01:14:07,199
Speaker 0: That was it.

1243

1244
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,634
Speaker 0: But for now, I leave you simply with...

01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:41,258
Speaker 1: Who's the friendly little bee playing oh so happily, buzzing here and buzzing there, easy buzzing everywhere, Maya loves and Maya cares, Maya gives and Maya shares, Maya likes to play around, but she'll never let you down, Maya the Bee.

1246
01:14:45,760 --> 01:15:03,951
Speaker 0: Maya, Maya the Bee, see her flying through the air, buzzing here and buzzing there, saying catch me if you dare, busy buzzing everywhere, Maya the Bee, Maya the Bee.
