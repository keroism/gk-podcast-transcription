1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,545
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Tuesday, May 4th.

2
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:12,327
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:14,611
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:20,279
Speaker 1: We talk about the dorfs or Dwarves in the vernacular.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,637
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:29,959
Speaker 1: It's gonna be a board game week on Friday.

7
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:34,174
Speaker 1: We got the nerd NYC game night as always and on Wednesday There's a muse games game night.

8
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:35,338
Speaker 0: Oh snap.

9
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:36,522
Speaker 0: It's too many board games.

10
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:37,486
Speaker 1: I'm going to both though.

11
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:38,630
Speaker 0: Are you this time?

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think I can go on Wednesday.

13
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,848
Speaker 0: Just because it would require you know with bicycling.

14
00:00:42,888 --> 00:00:46,389
Speaker 1: It's like You could take the subway and that cost money.

15
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:50,137
Speaker 0: Down there is that this is like the dilemma here.

16
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:54,027
Speaker 0: right if I get the unlimited subway card it costs like 80 bucks.

17
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:58,079
Speaker 0: Yep, but Basically, I'm free to just take the subway whatever.

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,925
Speaker 0: I don't have to think about it right like.

19
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:02,796
Speaker 0: but now I'm riding the bike.

20
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:08,138
Speaker 0: so the bike means that I can take the subway Less times per month.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,918
Speaker 0: I guess 32 times per month would make the $80 Infinite card worth it.

22
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:20,889
Speaker 0: if you go less than 32 trips Less than 32 swipes actually then the $80 unlimited card is not worth it.

23
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:27,030
Speaker 0: Do you really care about the odd two or three dollars randomly, but the thing is it's a lot of two or three dollars.

24
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:31,488
Speaker 0: But no think about it, right So I'm still saving money.

25
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:37,950
Speaker 0: But because I didn't ride my bike today because there's a 30% chance of rain it cost me like wait wait wait wait.

26
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,861
Speaker 1: 30% chance is not that likely.

27
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,090
Speaker 0: the clouds are all bleh in the morning.

28
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:47,029
Speaker 0: It was beautiful all day, but not when I was going to work.

29
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,499
Speaker 0: So it cost me seven dollars, so it's like fuck.

30
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:51,703
Speaker 0: so now you know.

31
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:52,466
Speaker 0: on the one hand.

32
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:53,610
Speaker 0: I am saving money.

33
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:02,006
Speaker 0: I am spending less than $80 per month on MetroCard, but at the same time I'm like conscious of X every trip.

34
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:04,309
Speaker 0: I take like Another trip.

35
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:06,138
Speaker 1: See I get the unlimited.

36
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:08,009
Speaker 0: I could just not take that trip and save some money.

37
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,769
Speaker 1: I rollerblade one way every day.

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,486
Speaker 1: So I'm already using half as many swipes as I would but I get the unlimited anyway because it's just.

39
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,853
Speaker 1: I don't have to worry About it.

40
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:17,283
Speaker 1: I'm just always subway.

41
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:20,594
Speaker 1: I use the subway egregiously Outrageously.

42
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:21,947
Speaker 1: I use it when I shouldn't even use it.

43
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,170
Speaker 1: like one day I was running and I was like a subway time and I took the subway home.

44
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,200
Speaker 0: huh I Would if I had limited fact.

45
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,470
Speaker 1: the other day it rained.

46
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:37,889
Speaker 1: I was in Bryant Park getting lunch So I just went into that subway station and took the subway the seven from Bryant Park to Grand Central to get back to work.

47
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:47,123
Speaker 0: Hey, why not, but you know the thing is it's like I'm trying to save some monies here, so If I start if I get the unlimited, I'm not saving Jack.

48
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,742
Speaker 1: I Can't feel like the difference is that much money between unlimited or not.

49
00:02:52,842 --> 00:03:01,073
Speaker 0: well if I bike right eight out of the 12 months of the year yeah eight times 40 bucks is $320.

50
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:06,796
Speaker 1: but then you have to subtract every time it rains and every time you do anything in the city no It's it's cuz I'm.

51
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,803
Speaker 0: that's taking into account basically.

52
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:11,875
Speaker 0: I'm not saying 80 times You know eight months.

53
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,684
Speaker 0: I'm saying 40 times eight months.

54
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:19,142
Speaker 0: see I'm basically assuming I'm still gonna pay 40 bucks a month on MetroCard, so I'm saving like $320.

55
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:24,504
Speaker 1: well as fascinating as that is I did finally beat my magic clash of heroes.

56
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,550
Speaker 0: Oh you actually beat it.

57
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, after I got to that boss that I couldn't beat I stopped playing.

58
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:34,108
Speaker 1: Every boss was pretty much trivial except the last one because the last one I had to fucking level up for.

59
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:35,960
Speaker 0: yeah No, but there was the necromancy one.

60
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,290
Speaker 0: were you supposed to use a certain item?

61
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:37,894
Speaker 0: I didn't use.

62
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:38,882
Speaker 1: you don't have to use an item.

63
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:39,910
Speaker 1: She was piece of there.

64
00:03:40,192 --> 00:03:41,604
Speaker 1: There was basically nothing to that battle.

65
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:43,397
Speaker 1: just kill her I didn't.

66
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,530
Speaker 1: or if you're a wuss use the spider cloak.

67
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,036
Speaker 0: And yeah, that's what I didn't know.

68
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:47,899
Speaker 0: to use the spider cloak.

69
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,565
Speaker 1: it seemed kind of obvious though.

70
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:50,870
Speaker 1: It's a crazily overpowered.

71
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,223
Speaker 1: It's like if you're playing Mario right and in world 8 right before Bowser.

72
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:56,727
Speaker 1: you have the option of like.

73
00:03:56,748 --> 00:04:02,410
Speaker 1: it says you could have Normal fire flower or you can have a fucking hammer suit that we brought in from the future.

74
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:03,497
Speaker 1: Pick one.

75
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,290
Speaker 1: they're both equal in cost.

76
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,710
Speaker 0: I think the reason I didn't pick it was cuz what it gives you like twice double damage.

77
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:14,250
Speaker 1: But it gives you plus 90% or plus a hundred percent or some crazy amount to all your guys.

78
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,909
Speaker 1: But it also makes your health starting health like way low right and then one vampire brings that all the way back up.

79
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:19,793
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't you?

80
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:20,276
Speaker 0: that's the thing.

81
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:21,562
Speaker 0: is I messed up without that.

82
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:21,882
Speaker 1: think of it.

83
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:22,103
Speaker 1: No.

84
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:23,250
Speaker 0: I don't use the vampires.

85
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:25,782
Speaker 0: I use the skeletons and the zombies one.

86
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:26,325
Speaker 1: You're stupid.

87
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:28,994
Speaker 1: You should be using the vampire To the vampire.

88
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,460
Speaker 1: Scott is with the ghost.

89
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,066
Speaker 1: It's a special guy not a normal guy.

90
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:32,608
Speaker 0: Oh is it?

91
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,350
Speaker 0: yeah I don't think I was using him at all.

92
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,029
Speaker 0: I was using like this mobbie in the and the zombies a normal guy the Draco Litch.

93
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,649
Speaker 1: But that's one of the double wide guys.

94
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:43,196
Speaker 1: What about your single wide guy?

95
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,424
Speaker 1: the only other option was the ghost and the ghost sucks.

96
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:46,347
Speaker 0: I don't know.

97
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:49,160
Speaker 1: I don't think you put much thought into that game.

98
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,290
Speaker 0: I play it was a long time ago.

99
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,164
Speaker 1: You didn't get to the awesome demon level which is pretty much the best level.

100
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:58,514
Speaker 1: that the most fun is to be had there I don't know.

101
00:04:58,554 --> 00:04:59,540
Speaker 0: I like the Connecticut level.

102
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one was okay.

103
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:03,750
Speaker 1: It wasn't that much going on though, and I didn't really like using the Knights.

104
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,760
Speaker 0: The thing is is way too many goddamn video games right now.

105
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:09,630
Speaker 0: It is not cool that to give me so many video games.

106
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:10,937
Speaker 0: Right, it's like pie cross.

107
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:12,384
Speaker 0: 3d came out for the DS.

108
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,168
Speaker 0: It's like I'll fuck you.

109
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:17,082
Speaker 1: So you're just playing a variant of Sudoku Sudoku effectively.

110
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:18,427
Speaker 0: now pie cross is far.

111
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,230
Speaker 0: Is it a game?

112
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:22,210
Speaker 1: Pie cross is it a competitive game?

113
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,056
Speaker 0: It's a puzzle just a puzzle.

114
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:26,383
Speaker 0: if you have a timer on it, then it becomes a game.

115
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:28,489
Speaker 1: So why not just play Sudoku?

116
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,278
Speaker 1: Because there's an algorithm in fact Scott.

117
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:33,943
Speaker 1: I have an algorithm that solves pie cross.

118
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:34,846
Speaker 1: It's called Photoshop.

119
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:42,917
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe Google image search I type in fire flower and bam But there's also.

120
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:46,710
Speaker 0: I didn't buy that by the way, but I probably will eventually.

121
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:50,845
Speaker 0: Also, right, I still have freaking the Edgeworth game that I haven't played at all.

122
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:52,190
Speaker 0: All right, it's just sitting there.

123
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:53,100
Speaker 1: I didn't even buy it.

124
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:58,804
Speaker 0: Yeah I still haven't played New Mario Brothers, which I haven't bought either from how long ago.

125
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:00,330
Speaker 0: It's probably still 50 bucks, isn't it?

126
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,330
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is one that games only worth playing if we have four crew people here to play.

127
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:07,308
Speaker 1: That's right, and we've got three right now.

128
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:07,990
Speaker 0: Yep.

129
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:14,530
Speaker 0: So then you know the Street Fighter which I actually am playing and the thing the reason I am playing that is because you got Nice crew going on.

130
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,000
Speaker 0: It's like if I go home tonight and turn it on like you.

131
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:19,250
Speaker 0: there's like a whole bunch of Xbox friends are gonna be on.

132
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,079
Speaker 0: We're getting a little endless game going on.

133
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:32,189
Speaker 1: I got to say to that you assholes I I was just gonna wait for it to come out on the fucking PC and have my little media PC with steam and whatever and just play it there with my windows.

134
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:35,630
Speaker 1: and Now, I think I gotta buy a stupid Xbox.

135
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:39,312
Speaker 1: I was just gonna wait like three or four years and get the next Xbox There.

136
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:39,895
Speaker 0: isn't that there?

137
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:43,373
Speaker 0: I think people you have to realize that you know The reason.

138
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:47,898
Speaker 0: part of the reason I bought an Xbox is that we realize It's not gonna be like before.

139
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,870
Speaker 0: there's not gonna be new consoles for quite a few years.

140
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:52,190
Speaker 0: These are gonna live a lot.

141
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,378
Speaker 1: But the thing is what bothers me is that there's no reason.

142
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:57,830
Speaker 1: my PC is more powerful than an Xbox and it's running Windows.

143
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:06,088
Speaker 1: There is no reason but the fact that they didn't do it that Xbox Live isn't just the same on Windows and I can't just play Every Xbox game on my Windows PC.

144
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:14,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it bothers me that I basically have to buy and if I buy a stupid Xbox I still got to make a freaking PC for the living room.

145
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,835
Speaker 0: Yep, I have both.

146
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:19,749
Speaker 0: and then you got to pay 50 bucks to get Xbox Live Gold at 50 bucks a year.

147
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:27,910
Speaker 0: if you want to play online Yep, I might do it anyway though because I gotta say then if you want a joystick you gotta pay a hundred bucks.

148
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:29,400
Speaker 1: I mean, I love fighting.

149
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,244
Speaker 0: or you can get the non good joystick I was never that or you can get the gamepad with six buttons.

150
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:34,210
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna get the mad cat.

151
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:41,224
Speaker 1: If I'm going I'm going all out But I don't foresee a Bushido blade coming on the horizon.

152
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:42,790
Speaker 1: No, so I can't wait for that.

153
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,310
Speaker 1: I can't wait for my glory day to return.

154
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,367
Speaker 0: Yes, you've got a problem as people have been practicing this game already for weeks, you know came out last week.

155
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:53,179
Speaker 0: You're behind Yeah But how long is it gonna take you to get all that stuff set up?

156
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,480
Speaker 0: our

157
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:59,350
Speaker 1: group community is gonna be much more fun to Play than say the Smash Brothers community because one online play

158
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:17,610
Speaker 0: The best thing is they have this endless mode and the way endless mode works is you get I think eight maybe ten people and they all join and Basically, everyone starts off You know lined up in the order in which you joined the top the two first people in the list fight Well, everyone else watches and then the loser goes to the bottom and the next person fights and loser goes.

159
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:19,764
Speaker 0: So it's like standing in the arcade.

160
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:20,710
Speaker 0: It's so awesome.

161
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:29,078
Speaker 0: And so basically you sit around and you just use your Xbox headsets and you just chat it up with everyone You know discussing what's going on like oh shit.

162
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:30,502
Speaker 0: He's a super Oh snap.

163
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:34,049
Speaker 0: Oh you cheap using that whatever, you know Everyone's chatting it up.

164
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:46,083
Speaker 0: You got like 10 people talking, you know voice chat and like a little conference while you watch people play Street Fighter and then every once in a while you play Street Fighter and if you win you just Keep playing Street Fighter as long as you keep winning just like the arcade.

165
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:46,887
Speaker 0: It's still awesome.

166
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:47,670
Speaker 1: I work today.

167
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,649
Speaker 1: I was I was reading that thread and I was thinking you know what god damn it and I almost just bought an Xbox right there.

168
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:53,795
Speaker 0: You better.

169
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:54,197
Speaker 0: I see.

170
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:56,770
Speaker 0: thing is if you want to get in quick you're better off going to the store and getting one.

171
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:57,796
Speaker 0: It's the same price.

172
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,030
Speaker 0: Oh, no, actually Amazon price is a big discount, don't they?

173
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,355
Speaker 1: It's hard to say because I gotta.

174
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,881
Speaker 1: I gotta compare because Best Buy.

175
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:05,250
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and I pre-ordered Starcraft 2.

176
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:05,612
Speaker 0: So I get.

177
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,944
Speaker 0: I'm supposed to get a beta key sometime this week.

178
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:09,070
Speaker 1: You're already fucked everyone.

179
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,836
Speaker 1: I know workers who like Starcraft.

180
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:14,530
Speaker 1: They've been playing some pirated ass leaked copy for the last month.

181
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,519
Speaker 0: I'm already fuck cuz I just suck ass.

182
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:21,624
Speaker 0: but you know, whatever you got to practice the turn-based - and it's - is gonna come out eventually, right?

183
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:23,913
Speaker 0: Yeah So what it?

184
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:24,657
Speaker 0: what's the fuck?

185
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:27,490
Speaker 1: see my pro at least NS2 is definitely a ways out.

186
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,636
Speaker 1: I mean you play that alpha.

187
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,225
Speaker 1: I played that not even an alpha.

188
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:34,745
Speaker 1: That was a pre alpha Yeah, and one and then I slept his death sitting there.

189
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:35,830
Speaker 0: that you know, I'm tweaking.

190
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:43,330
Speaker 1: Yeah well I was poking at that because I sadly my plan was to use it for a secret project at Paxi or Pax West Pax Prime.

191
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:48,170
Speaker 1: we can't divulge that yet, but For various reasons I have pushed that back.

192
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,839
Speaker 1: So I have a whole year now to do.

193
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:53,617
Speaker 1: the thing I was going to do with sleep is death You know for the next Pax East.

194
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,189
Speaker 1: so that's basically at the bottom of the hopper right now.

195
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, but looking at so many goddamn games.

196
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,309
Speaker 1: Yeah project Dorf Civ 5 is coming.

197
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:02,730
Speaker 1: We're fucked.

198
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,675
Speaker 0: Fuck me, right that one.

199
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:08,184
Speaker 1: The worst part is all the games that we're gonna play.

200
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:10,230
Speaker 1: It's not like they're all out right now.

201
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:12,197
Speaker 1: It's that not only are enough.

202
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,410
Speaker 0: coming out faster than I can play them is the problem.

203
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:21,050
Speaker 0: It's like, you know Street Fighter can I could just play only that and ignore all other games for quite some time?

204
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,234
Speaker 0: Cuz there's a lot to do.

205
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:25,725
Speaker 1: Luckily Team Fortress 2 is just beyond hope.

206
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:27,230
Speaker 1: It's not have no son situation now.

207
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,204
Speaker 1: So don't have to worry about that.

208
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:28,650
Speaker 0: What?

209
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:30,534
Speaker 0: Why?

210
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:31,700
Speaker 0: why is this news now?

211
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,530
Speaker 0: We discussed that I think years ago.

212
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,781
Speaker 1: I didn't say it was news, but here's something.

213
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:37,410
Speaker 0: imagine if I even bring it up.

214
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,841
Speaker 1: imagine if you would quit World of Warcraft because you realize it was just a grind.

215
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:45,110
Speaker 1: and then like two years went by and One day you saw your account.

216
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:53,350
Speaker 1: You're like Let's go see what's going on in that grindy coffee bean game and you logged in and they had literally and you saw like an update flash.

217
00:10:53,511 --> 00:11:03,410
Speaker 1: it was like there there's been an update since you last played and Here's the new interface and it was literally just a physical wheel you had to buy and spin to grind out levels.

218
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:08,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is the equivalent of going back to play Team Fortress 2. now that game is dead.

219
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:09,233
Speaker 1: I have no son.

220
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:12,363
Speaker 1: The worst part is it is so crazy.

221
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,510
Speaker 1: There are more people playing that than playing Counter-Strike.

222
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:17,488
Speaker 1: Yep What does this world come to?

223
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,962
Speaker 0: People who don't play no skill games except right.

224
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:22,650
Speaker 0: we thought all people don't like games of skill.

225
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,515
Speaker 0: Well, there's three fighters three fighters.

226
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:27,825
Speaker 0: So that's way more a game of skill than like even Counter-Strike.

227
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:34,043
Speaker 1: I think here's one reason why Fighting games are a game that still exists in what few arcades they are.

228
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:36,010
Speaker 1: We're in that Mott Street Chinatown arcade.

229
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:37,013
Speaker 1: What was it?

230
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:46,588
Speaker 1: a hundred fighting games and Azen standing there playing them for there was a line of people waiting Outside that arcade for the fucking open so they could go in and play Street Fighter all day.

231
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:50,120
Speaker 1: Yep There's no such thing as that for FPS is.

232
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:52,170
Speaker 1: so you already lose that avenue of getting into it.

233
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,740
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and to the consoles on the console.

234
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:58,990
Speaker 1: You can still have a hardcore fighting game like Street Fighter.

235
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,185
Speaker 1: You can't have a hardcore FPS.

236
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:01,970
Speaker 1: It is absolutely.

237
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:19,718
Speaker 1: If we could somehow make a hardcore console FPS, which is impossible Or I think what would do it is if every game that was available on the Xbox was also available on any like Windows 7 PC or maybe Windows 7 Gaming Edition, you know some bullshit.

238
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,669
Speaker 0: be like Team Fortress 2 where you have a mouse, but it's really just.

239
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:23,738
Speaker 0: you know an analog stick.

240
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:31,070
Speaker 1: but if The Xbox stuff were on the PC it would be possible to make a game aimed at those PC people.

241
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:34,141
Speaker 1: That was the straight-up hardcore and people would see.

242
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:42,250
Speaker 0: but any FPS game the aim situation it totally You know, they won't make a game with precise quake aim because then you'll be unplayable on a console.

243
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:48,427
Speaker 1: So I think the moral here is we need Capcom to find like John Romero's corpse and reanimate it.

244
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:53,590
Speaker 1: I don't think he's actually dead Far from it, but imagine if Capcom just made a new hardcore FPS.

245
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:57,578
Speaker 0: Capcom doesn't know how to make an FPS for shit I know but they know they know.

246
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,669
Speaker 1: it said the people who know what to do.

247
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:01,688
Speaker 1: Well, you should get the people who can do it.

248
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,789
Speaker 0: What you do is you get the Capcom art team to work with valve on an FPS.

249
00:13:06,512 --> 00:13:09,483
Speaker 0: Oh, no way, but valve made Team Fortress 2 but valve also made good.

250
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:11,230
Speaker 1: FPS is the worst part is valve?

251
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,289
Speaker 1: No, they know how to make a good FPS, but they also know how to make an FPS that makes money.

252
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:25,374
Speaker 1: And if you know how to do both It's like if I know magic missile and fireball and I can cast them an equal number of times What am I gonna cast?

253
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:32,190
Speaker 0: Anyway, I guess unless I'm fighting a ghost too many goddamn games coming out I got another one in my news to discuss.

254
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:39,010
Speaker 1: So speaking of games and speaking of Street Fighter, but this may be news to some of you.

255
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,070
Speaker 1: I would hope that you all know about this, but I'd heard about it.

256
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,114
Speaker 1: I didn't know what it was until I finally Like.

257
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:46,829
Speaker 1: it was everywhere and I just looked at this stupid article and watch the trailers.

258
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:50,201
Speaker 1: Street Fighter legacy is not a game.

259
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:52,470
Speaker 1: It's a movie based on Street Fighter.

260
00:13:52,610 --> 00:14:01,695
Speaker 0: oh, we don't have enough of those being made by Joey Ansa who is a for real Hollywood guy and We don't have any of those.

261
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,919
Speaker 0: we've never seen this before.

262
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:12,810
Speaker 1: so before you doubters doubt and before you haters hate You need to check out these trailers because I've never seen a trailer for a video game movie in any capacity.

263
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,229
Speaker 0: I've never seen a trailer that looks as good as the one for kassan.

264
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:19,357
Speaker 1: God I remember that.

265
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:20,965
Speaker 0: All right, I win that argument.

266
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:25,830
Speaker 1: All right, so I think this guy knows what's up.

267
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,878
Speaker 1: There's a lot of crazy like surprising.

268
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:29,525
Speaker 1: Hollywood talent is behind this.

269
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:30,630
Speaker 1: It's a short film.

270
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,245
Speaker 1: It is coming out Thursday as in two days from now in real movie theaters.

271
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:36,750
Speaker 1: No on the internet for free

272
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:37,310
Speaker 0: Okay

273
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:51,553
Speaker 1: And I'm going to quote for you exactly what the guy who made this had to say because this gives me hope Just like when the guy who made bionic commando Rearmed said his little thing about what he liked about bionic commando and we all knew what was up and we knew that he knew What was up?

274
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:55,850
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm quote as an actor filmmaker and a fan.

275
00:14:56,592 --> 00:15:02,490
Speaker 1: I've been repeatedly disappointed by the many diluted unfaithful and outright butchered movie adaptations of fighting video games.

276
00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:24,714
Speaker 1: It was clear to me that given the way the movie industry worked We would never see a super faithful darker toned more adult themed or just plain good incarnation of Street Fighter unless a diehard fan director or filmmaking team with a game can and knowledge Filmmaking know-how and the connection stepped up to the plate and made it happen Mm-hmm.

277
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:27,570
Speaker 1: So basically it's kind of a robert-coups situation.

278
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:39,230
Speaker 1: You've got someone who's brilliant in one realm like already professional already knows what's up But is also a fan of like a real fan of some other thing that does not have talent like that in the realm.

279
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:45,430
Speaker 1: And when you combine those two magic happens, so I'm about I withhold judgment until Thursday.

280
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:55,483
Speaker 1: I'm almost willing to call this guy the Robert coup of making Street Fighter movies happen And he got the director of top gear to help him do this.

281
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:59,619
Speaker 1: Owen Trevor, okay, yeah Seriously watching these trailers.

282
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,548
Speaker 1: I'm I'm legitimately excited.

283
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:05,910
Speaker 0: Okay, so you're ready for another game to eat up your time?

284
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,052
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah But there's like a Tecmo Bowl on.

285
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:12,819
Speaker 0: don't eat on the 360 like it's Tecmo Bowl retro or something remake.

286
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:13,680
Speaker 0: and there's also.

287
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:19,014
Speaker 1: You listeners might not realize it but I actually really really like football games.

288
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:21,320
Speaker 0: football games are the best not recent football.

289
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, not Madden anything, you know.

290
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,553
Speaker 1: remember Madden on the we quarterback club.

291
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:27,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, anything like that is good.

292
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:31,219
Speaker 0: Here's another game to eat up your time here.

293
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:37,758
Speaker 0: So apparently they're coming out with a game called Castlevania harmony of despair, which is HD, right?

294
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:39,184
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah That's right.

295
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,817
Speaker 0: Might and Magic Clash of Heroes is gonna be on the 360 also.

296
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:42,380
Speaker 0: There's another game.

297
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,172
Speaker 0: Every turn Dave Riley was like what game should I play?

298
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:48,200
Speaker 1: and I was like might magic clash of heroes.

299
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,272
Speaker 1: He was like, yeah, I'll just wait for it to come out on the Xbox.

300
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:53,540
Speaker 0: Castlevania HD harmony of despair.

301
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:55,230
Speaker 0: I always love how they do that like DS.

302
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,598
Speaker 0: They did Donna sorrow, right?

303
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,451
Speaker 1: Well portrait of ruin didn't really do much PR yeah, but what did what that stand for?

304
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:03,275
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

305
00:17:03,295 --> 00:17:04,240
Speaker 0: It's just the funny joke.

306
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,659
Speaker 1: They do you know what it stood for not as good.

307
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,290
Speaker 0: So there's a rumor that went out and it's looking.

308
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:16,358
Speaker 0: there was like a leaked document that was then Unleaked or whatever, but basically the rumor is and it's pretty good.

309
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,020
Speaker 0: rumor Is that this is gonna be a Castlevania just like the DS ones and the GBA ones?

310
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:46,813
Speaker 0: But it's going to be a six players simultaneous co-op multiplayer Metroidvania game and apparently there are screenshots indicating that the Aria of sorrow character a la card The portrait of ruin character the order of ecclesia character the port another portrait of ruin character will all be Playable, so like six different characters from the you know, GBA and DS series,

311
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:49,600
Speaker 1: but all I want is Simon and Trevor

312
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,127
Speaker 0: Altogether some.

313
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:56,240
Speaker 0: well, you know, they didn't say they're not in there But yeah, but I can't trust that it's gonna be an Xbox live arcade game.

314
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,776
Speaker 0: Well, I guess all these Castlevania.

315
00:17:57,937 --> 00:18:02,460
Speaker 0: basically It's like, you know symphony tonight where everyone's playing at once and that is like the best thing ever.

316
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:06,897
Speaker 0: So, you know if there's that's Konami, that's not even Capcom.

317
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:10,952
Speaker 0: So quite surprising Box tonight just tonight.

318
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,322
Speaker 1: Yeah I'll just go and get one.

319
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:14,243
Speaker 1: Damn it.

320
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:16,926
Speaker 0: All right.

321
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:24,362
Speaker 0: I just bought a friggin gaming PC - yeah, I Just bought a new laptop, but I'm not using that to play games only to mail.

322
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:28,281
Speaker 0: I might but you know, oh, yeah By the way, like Linux team we want to talk about that.

323
00:18:28,301 --> 00:18:30,150
Speaker 0: Oh Mac and Linux team.

324
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,070
Speaker 0: I mean we talked about Mac's team, but now there's screenshots of Linux team.

325
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,715
Speaker 1: Well here predictions about that.

326
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:36,441
Speaker 1: the fact I mean we they.

327
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:37,786
Speaker 1: it's been talked about that.

328
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:42,182
Speaker 1: this was happening for a long time But the news is kind of just that it's actually happening.

329
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:44,110
Speaker 1: Yeah any more than we expected.

330
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's something that I should have predicted because it was sort of obvious that you know people don't realize this.

331
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:58,050
Speaker 0: But the old steam client right which is pretty much the one that was around a couple weeks ago Until they just switched it just now Use was heavily integrated with Internet Explorer.

332
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,545
Speaker 0: Like if you open up steam the store that you were looking at was actually just steam powered.

333
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:03,870
Speaker 0: calm and it was used.

334
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,760
Speaker 0: You know Internet Explorer was built into it.

335
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,294
Speaker 0: So they what they did is they recently Upgraded the steam client.

336
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:13,750
Speaker 0: So it's now based on the webkit browser, which is what's in Safari and Chrome not Firefox.

337
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,670
Speaker 0: and So now, you know, so it's like, huh?

338
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:21,488
Speaker 0: Okay, they finally made it better and you think the reason they would do that is just cuz IE sucks, but it's like.

339
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:30,423
Speaker 0: no Obviously the reason to do that is that you can get the steam client to run on something besides Windows But if you use IE you can't you you know, that wouldn't be enough.

340
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:35,146
Speaker 1: what I expected perfectly Honestly, even when this was all like announced for real and not just a rumor.

341
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:41,210
Speaker 1: I Expected them to make it available and only a handful of games would get ported.

342
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, like they would sell Linux games or they would sell Mac games in the Mac one.

343
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,910
Speaker 0: But you know and me the thing is it looks like they're actually to port the valve games and not only that.

344
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,170
Speaker 0: But it's like if you legitimately own them, then you legitimately get them, you know, I bought half-life 2.

345
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,730
Speaker 0: So they port half-life 2 to Linux and I install steam on Linux.

346
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:02,509
Speaker 0: I download it again just like you know, I always don't to pay for it.

347
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,229
Speaker 1: now What's interesting is think about this.

348
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:10,030
Speaker 1: Imagine, you know four years from now, let's say if steam just works on all three major OS's.

349
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,101
Speaker 1: well, maybe all two major OS's and you can choose which one.

350
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:28,490
Speaker 1: I'm leaving out based on your personal preference, but That really kind of side swipes if Microsoft in the long run is trying to make but when the Xbox Windows gaming platform their thing because steam would kind of work on everything and gamers trust steam a lot.

351
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:44,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it just really encourages Like people especially people making small indie games or whatever, you know Like, you know if steam runs on Mac and Linux and encourages you if you're making a game to sell on the steam to also make sure your Game works on Mac and Linux.

352
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that you can get you know more sales.

353
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,687
Speaker 0: And of course, you know, they're gonna have all the statistics about how many installs are out there with.

354
00:20:51,049 --> 00:21:07,490
Speaker 0: you know OS X and Linux, but I think it's gonna be a slight chicken and egg situation where you know, okay People are still only using the windows team So no one's gonna make games for the you know Mac and Linux team unless it's gonna be enough extra sales to be worth it.

355
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,370
Speaker 1: But valve is obviously going to push this by porting all their game.

356
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,340
Speaker 0: Yes, so that might right.

357
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,450
Speaker 0: if this you know, there's some people out there It's it's like a slight crack in the eggshell of the chicken eggs problem, right?

358
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:47,298
Speaker 0: You know some people who are currently using windows just for gaming, you know might go Aha, I finally have steam on a win Apple or I finally have steam on Linux and they'll switch and that slight switch Will upset the numbers a little bit and then it will slowly move and slowly move and maybe eventually Right X years down the line, you know, there'll be some sort of you know miracle where there's just enough games That run on not windows that you know all the gamers won't have any reason to use them.

359
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:54,424
Speaker 0: and if the performance gets better on OS X and Linux than it is on Windows then you're gonna see some crazy shit happen.

360
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:55,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see about that.

361
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that made the big problem.

362
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,229
Speaker 0: that was direct direct X rather than steam.

363
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:04,984
Speaker 1: I don't foresee anyone making a cross-platform equivalent of DirectX anytime soon.

364
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:05,887
Speaker 0: No, it's not gonna happen.

365
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:06,670
Speaker 0: It's called OpenGL.

366
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:16,705
Speaker 0: It's not really the equivalent things of the day.

367
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:20,110
Speaker 1: It's been all over the place, but it's surprisingly high quality.

368
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:21,830
Speaker 1: There's the Super Mario crossover.

369
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:32,330
Speaker 1: basically, you can play Mario 1 as far as I can tell much of if not all of the way through it as Samus Characters every level - yeah.

370
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,981
Speaker 1: but the best part about this is people have done this a million times over.

371
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:38,409
Speaker 1: it wouldn't be notable if someone had.

372
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:43,771
Speaker 1: you can Play the first level of Mario 1 as spider-man from the Atari 2600.

373
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:50,190
Speaker 1: Every character pretty much controls exactly like the character like exactly like they did in the game.

374
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:56,270
Speaker 0: They're from well except for some changes like little things like double jump in Simon Belmont and link can jump.

375
00:22:56,872 --> 00:23:08,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, granny it's weird that they did Zelda 1 link because Zelda 2 link actually would have worked really really well Yeah, but I think if you know It's interesting to use all the one link because it's like Zelda 2 link is so similar to like Belmont or yep.

376
00:23:10,832 --> 00:23:16,199
Speaker 1: It's so surprisingly well executed that It's well worth checking out.

377
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,132
Speaker 1: do not pass this up All right.

378
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:23,310
Speaker 0: Well, you know Street Fighter isn't pretty much the focus lately in terms of video games.

379
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:27,021
Speaker 0: So I have for you a simple YouTube video not anything very exciting.

380
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,070
Speaker 0: It is the world record Street Fighter 4 combo.

381
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,299
Speaker 1: Oh, man, Scott showed this to me.

382
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,105
Speaker 1: It's pretty crazy.

383
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,437
Speaker 0: Yeah I've seen some crazy combos.

384
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,807
Speaker 0: This is the craziest combo and it is a world record.

385
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:39,489
Speaker 0: So there you go.

386
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,410
Speaker 1: I don't know if I could deal with that combo if it was put before me.

387
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:43,996
Speaker 0: I definitely could not deal with it.

388
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:48,717
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean the last time I had a combo like that was God I was like high school.

389
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,328
Speaker 0: I've never had a combo like that.

390
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:59,490
Speaker 1: So Dwarves Which have vaguely Scottish accents most of the time but not always.

391
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:10,128
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we we've talked about dwarf fortress on the show quite a bit and at PAX I mean as you recall the losing should be fun panel basically starts and ends with dwarf fortress.

392
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:13,177
Speaker 0: Yep So, you know we were.

393
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:17,890
Speaker 0: you know after our last burning wheel campaign ended we tried to start up some new stuff.

394
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:20,369
Speaker 0: You know, some people are trying to do some burning dark Sun.

395
00:24:21,215 --> 00:24:23,329
Speaker 0: Some other people are trying some other action.

396
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:30,302
Speaker 0: But you know, I was looking for an idea of something that would actually Sail right from the forum.

397
00:24:30,424 --> 00:24:33,596
Speaker 1: No is Water is poison.

398
00:24:33,616 --> 00:24:35,083
Speaker 0: Who always he has all the ideas.

399
00:24:35,827 --> 00:24:44,050
Speaker 0: So anyway You know, he's like, hey, I got an idea burning wheel dwarf fortress and I'm like, oh shit people would actually play that.

400
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,917
Speaker 1: Well, didn't he present it more like here?

401
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:47,482
Speaker 1: cuz the way you presented it to me was.

402
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:50,229
Speaker 1: so check out this idea for a burning wheel scenario.

403
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:55,927
Speaker 1: Seven dwarves go out to form a fortress strike the earth.

404
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:58,360
Speaker 0: Yeah And it was perfect.

405
00:24:58,642 --> 00:24:59,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's too perfect.

406
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:00,990
Speaker 0: It's supposed to be six doors.

407
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:09,045
Speaker 0: But and it was weird cuz like I thought it was six and then we ended up with four and I'm like Oh, it's not six like I wanted but you know what four is gonna be very manageable.

408
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:14,107
Speaker 1: and then Phil and she came Like seven people and I'm like fuck and Steve it was perfect though.

409
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,364
Speaker 0: Yeah Absolutely, it's still a few two more people that I can handle.

410
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:19,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get better.

411
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,589
Speaker 1: You haven't DM too much in recent history.

412
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:24,656
Speaker 1: I mean your last foray into that was the kobolds.

413
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:25,618
Speaker 1: ate my baby games.

414
00:25:25,638 --> 00:25:28,067
Speaker 0: that count I Would count it.

415
00:25:28,712 --> 00:25:29,235
Speaker 0: I don't think that.

416
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:35,224
Speaker 0: the thing is I blame partially the players in that game who are not The players who tried to do cool stuff and everything they did.

417
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:36,190
Speaker 1: you said now that wouldn't work.

418
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,657
Speaker 0: That's not how this game would play.

419
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:38,802
Speaker 0: kobolds ate my baby works.

420
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:40,610
Speaker 1: So how does kobolds eat my baby work?

421
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,715
Speaker 0: It's a retarded game.

422
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:43,745
Speaker 0: You're just supposed to go around and try to get the.

423
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:47,430
Speaker 0: it's like playing zombies Basically, you're not really supposed to try to roleplay it up.

424
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

425
00:25:52,235 --> 00:25:55,716
Speaker 1: so You got nothing to say captain game master.

426
00:25:55,916 --> 00:26:00,490
Speaker 1: We played burning dwarf fortress, which is the inevitable conclusion of any game of dwarf fortress.

427
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:01,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

428
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:10,730
Speaker 0: I was wondering, you know, you think on paper that it would work really well and then We played it and for the most part it actually did work really well just like we thought it would.

429
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:16,390
Speaker 0: You know, the thing is I had to try to find a balance between the burning wheelness and the dwarf fortress ness.

430
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,791
Speaker 0: It's like.

431
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:18,096
Speaker 0: should I make them like?

432
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,982
Speaker 0: count all the resources they have?

433
00:26:20,063 --> 00:26:25,430
Speaker 1: no to a degree we should though I mean, yeah, it's like like I've cut some really nice limestone.

434
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:27,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you got to remember that kind of stuff.

435
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,633
Speaker 0: But you know, it's like okay Am I gonna have?

436
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:33,609
Speaker 0: you know, should we count like how many you know?

437
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:37,468
Speaker 0: Barrels of nog or should it should it just be you had?

438
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,957
Speaker 0: all right, the nog is good this year.

439
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:48,308
Speaker 1: actually what I was thinking is the way to go about that is to have a Resources stat for each major thing or maybe just a resources stat.

440
00:26:48,428 --> 00:26:50,739
Speaker 1: overall That is the end.

441
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:53,070
Speaker 1: the character that has this stat is the fortress.

442
00:26:53,753 --> 00:27:00,628
Speaker 1: hmm, so like you do things to basically level up the stats for food and wealth and

443
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:11,550
Speaker 0: Dwarves, I think it's best to just basically keep it as a you know In the in the rules, right if you have zero resources someone supposed to give you a loan of a temporary res point.

444
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:16,350
Speaker 0: So I think that having like a good is sort of like having a temporary res point, right?

445
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:23,010
Speaker 0: So if you make something that's you know, a perishable or disposable good is something you're gonna trade away.

446
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:36,500
Speaker 1: They just made the big this big pile of temporary resource points that could be used Because half the fun of burning we about burning wheel of dwarf fortress is the minutia and the other half is watching everyone eventually Dive some horrible situation.

447
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,707
Speaker 0: that part worked really well.

448
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:42,949
Speaker 1: god How could we fail such a low obstacle after having rolled so many dice?

449
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:43,828
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean it was nice.

450
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:47,185
Speaker 0: It was kind of hard for me because I was like trying to gauge the obstacles.

451
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:49,677
Speaker 0: and the thing is, you know You're not five life paths.

452
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:50,119
Speaker 0: You're four.

453
00:27:50,219 --> 00:27:52,129
Speaker 0: So you're not that powerful, but you're pretty powerful.

454
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:58,277
Speaker 1: well, and you're between four and five is the difference between like Artificer and master of art.

455
00:27:58,317 --> 00:27:59,020
Speaker 1: Yeah.

456
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,610
Speaker 0: I mean if I didn't give you four you wouldn't be able to do anything, right?

457
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:07,170
Speaker 0: so I had to give you four and You know, you've got all kinds of forks and Arthas and things.

458
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,279
Speaker 0: You're just getting shit done that you wanted to get done.

459
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,890
Speaker 1: Nobody took my favorite trait though remarkable flatulence.

460
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:17,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, I couldn't really justify higher obstacles and a lot of these mundane tasks, you know.

461
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:19,569
Speaker 0: But I needed you to fail for awesomeness to happen.

462
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:27,890
Speaker 1: Well, no I think the point is no matter what you do if you keep introducing things success We'll just raise the bar for failure.

463
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:32,590
Speaker 1: Like the more you succeed the more catastrophic failure will be in the long run.

464
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:38,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I need to get you to do stuff that's you know harder such that you know There actually will be a failure.

465
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,465
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we failed immediately.

466
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,013
Speaker 0: Yeah Person failed.

467
00:28:43,073 --> 00:28:45,282
Speaker 0: I felt like everyone else is just succeeding way too much.

468
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:50,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, and at the same time It's like I got engaged what the correct obstacles should be.

469
00:28:50,288 --> 00:28:50,469
Speaker 0: better.

470
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,930
Speaker 0: It's actually like the hardest part of GMing burning wheel is figuring out like what the obstacle should be.

471
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:56,469
Speaker 0: It's tough and having it be correct.

472
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,918
Speaker 1: It is tough with the front row crew because people tend to.

473
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:05,763
Speaker 1: our burning wheel games are very specific in that a certain certain Sets of the crew like myself or Scott Johnson.

474
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:07,510
Speaker 1: We're in that both in the same camp.

475
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:19,008
Speaker 1: We'll play very straightforward Earnest characters who strive for what they want in a very direct way and tend to not be just backstabbing assholes and then people like Pete.

476
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:29,329
Speaker 1: and Pete Always play the character who's good on the surface But then does like some crazy like as soon as getting Scott's like alright on the game.

477
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:32,002
Speaker 1: master You've accomplished your great task.

478
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:32,909
Speaker 1: What do you do now?

479
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,945
Speaker 1: And Pete's the kind of person will say something like I just try to stab the king right here.

480
00:29:37,347 --> 00:29:38,090
Speaker 1: Let's see what happens.

481
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:39,496
Speaker 1: I just go for it.

482
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:40,240
Speaker 1: I got that belief.

483
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,405
Speaker 0: That's good.

484
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:42,390
Speaker 0: I need more of that.

485
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,337
Speaker 0: I wish you would do that.

486
00:29:43,357 --> 00:29:45,753
Speaker 1: He's brought a little bit I don't know.

487
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:51,329
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna work really well for this game because we don't want just our fortress We want some of the burning wheel shtick.

488
00:29:51,972 --> 00:30:04,627
Speaker 1: But he's basically bringing in the outside world by trying to affect the outside world from the fortress which will work though because it's gonna bring Consequences from the outside world back in something that real dwarf fortress really doesn't do.

489
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:07,256
Speaker 0: it Does it a little bit but not very much.

490
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:11,530
Speaker 1: most it does is that if one of your dwarfs wanders way out and leads something?

491
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:17,690
Speaker 1: Back it'll cause chaos, but you're not gonna have like a caravan of traders or like dwarf refugees coming in.

492
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,730
Speaker 0: Do you have dwarf refugees and caravans and traders coming in all the time?

493
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:28,252
Speaker 1: You didn't let me finish who themselves because they went out from the fortress or came in in a certain route lead monsters to the Fortress.

494
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:29,476
Speaker 0: Yes, that happens all the time.

495
00:30:29,516 --> 00:30:31,101
Speaker 0: When does that happen all the time?

496
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,227
Speaker 0: Uh-huh that happens in door fortress.

497
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:37,165
Speaker 0: So You don't know anything about door fortress cuz I've never played it.

498
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:37,627
Speaker 1: I can't.

499
00:30:37,707 --> 00:30:38,210
Speaker 0: it's impossible.

500
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:40,303
Speaker 0: So why are you saying things about you don't know.

501
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:41,290
Speaker 1: have you ever had that happen?

502
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:44,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you had a monster follow a refugee in who wouldn't have otherwise come.

503
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:51,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if there's a monster just like out in the you know in the distance, you know And the monster is basically when they see something they want to eat.

504
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:52,490
Speaker 0: They'll follow it, right?

505
00:30:52,650 --> 00:31:02,950
Speaker 1: So if like but so it's just like a monster following but not more strange far-reaching consequences Like a far-off civilization finds out about the fortress because you gave something to a caravan.

506
00:31:04,111 --> 00:31:07,990
Speaker 0: No, but you know caravans show up and then they might be followed by something if it's out there.

507
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:19,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird because the real door fortress as Complexity as it is at the same time seems to almost belie itself by An extremely restricting simplicity of action.

508
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,594
Speaker 0: No, that's you know It's it's a lot of.

509
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:28,850
Speaker 0: it's a lot of just separate systems that all interact with each other in interesting ways.

510
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:50,485
Speaker 0: And because there's so many systems and each system, you know while ranging in Complexity is actually fairly detailed or perhaps overly detailed in some instances, you know Very interesting things just sort of happen like that, you know Like there's a monster system monsters will follow things that they can eat, you know And try to eat more things if it's a big monster.

511
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:58,270
Speaker 0: and at the same time There's another system every X months every X seasons traders will appear and look go head towards your trade depot.

512
00:31:58,713 --> 00:32:01,390
Speaker 0: So if these two systems working together, right?

513
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,990
Speaker 0: Monster traders chasing to the trade depot monster in the trade depot monster in your fortress?

514
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:18,967
Speaker 1: Oh, no, of course It is still interesting about how by Abstracting all of that and adding just a tiny bit of human intelligence not even that much You basically accomplish the same stories by just using burning wheel to do it.

515
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:21,110
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean part of the things though.

516
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,207
Speaker 0: Is that like a lot of this stuff in?

517
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,296
Speaker 0: Dwarf or just that makes no sense.

518
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:29,190
Speaker 0: you start to realize how little sense it makes when you start playing her burning wheel.

519
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:34,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like the rate at which they excavate and the ease in which they excavate, you know, it's like.

520
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:37,253
Speaker 0: no not really That's not gonna happen.

521
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:42,789
Speaker 0: You're not gonna dig like gigantic tunnels that are really complex so quickly it that just doesn't go.

522
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:51,283
Speaker 1: Yeah of course what we haven't done in the burning wheel game that I think you really need to do more is really because Burning wheel has very specific rules about how long it takes for things to get done.

523
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:58,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hard to figure that out Yeah, but you just kind of wing it and give people turns or something because excavating a cave is like a week-long endeavor.

524
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:05,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, yep It's you know, it's like how do I know how long excavating a cave takes?

525
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,969
Speaker 1: Well, just wing it, you know, it takes say it takes a week.

526
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:11,282
Speaker 0: Well, you know, maybe it takes a day cuz you're awesome dwarves.

527
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:13,150
Speaker 1: Well, do you want it to take a day instead?

528
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,616
Speaker 0: I don't know how long I want it today.

529
00:33:14,656 --> 00:33:17,330
Speaker 1: Well, you should decide that before you DM a game of dwarf archers.

530
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:18,966
Speaker 0: It's not easy.

531
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:24,984
Speaker 0: What I think because the thing is the right answer right you think in D&D right.

532
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:29,077
Speaker 0: the right answer to that question would be Well, how long does it take to excavate?

533
00:33:29,357 --> 00:33:33,430
Speaker 0: but the right answer in burning wheel is not how long it actually takes to excavate.

534
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:39,490
Speaker 0: The answer is what length of time would provide the best story, you know, that is the correct answer.

535
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:42,467
Speaker 0: So, I don't know what the you know, which length of time?

536
00:33:42,628 --> 00:33:44,279
Speaker 1: of course That's in standard burning wheel.

537
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:52,550
Speaker 1: with a game like to our fortress word We're bridging the gap between just a role-playing game where we want interesting immersion story to happen and a simulator.

538
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,334
Speaker 1: I mean, we're still we're.

539
00:33:53,455 --> 00:34:01,669
Speaker 1: also there's certain elements of us who want to play Sim dwarf and we want mechanical effects of the mechanical actions that we take.

540
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:06,870
Speaker 0: But then we got to start like doing all sorts of Excel spreadsheets and shit, but you don't have to do a lot.

541
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:14,484
Speaker 1: That's why I think a really elegant way to do that is to have stats for the fortress that can be called upon like dice Pools, I hate making up rules, but they're so easy.

542
00:34:14,504 --> 00:34:15,268
Speaker 1: I already made them up.

543
00:34:15,308 --> 00:34:15,750
Speaker 1: They're done.

544
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:19,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I hate like just throwing in rules that like haven't been tested yet.

545
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,750
Speaker 1: Just wait, I mean we've learned with games like power grid that half the time it just works out anyway.

546
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:30,135
Speaker 0: You know cuz you knows what kind of weird things gonna happen that I won't be able to like undo and then someone's gonna make Trouble.

547
00:34:30,317 --> 00:34:30,781
Speaker 0: who cares?

548
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:31,610
Speaker 1: that'll be awesome.

549
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,842
Speaker 1: I mean, what are we gonna do?

550
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,369
Speaker 1: what I?

551
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,681
Speaker 1: Accidentally get a bunch of mithril and then because of a bug in Scott's brain.

552
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:39,206
Speaker 1: I forge an awesome sword.

553
00:34:39,408 --> 00:34:41,871
Speaker 0: That's no good Can't let that have.

554
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:44,821
Speaker 1: you have the power to patch those bugs quickly and easily.

555
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:47,550
Speaker 1: a dragon eats my sword a dragon eats me.

556
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:49,661
Speaker 0: No, then we're going back to D&D land.

557
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:54,215
Speaker 0: I got to stay in burning wheel and But Then you need to use the rules.

558
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:56,184
Speaker 1: you can't just use what you're bringing to the table.

559
00:34:56,204 --> 00:34:57,550
Speaker 1: you gotta have rules to do it all.

560
00:34:58,053 --> 00:34:58,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other problem.

561
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:07,151
Speaker 0: Is that you know people are so Like arguing like if I come in and I'll be like look the OBS is five people like oh fuck you the OBS should be Three.

562
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:12,454
Speaker 1: it's not that people people people that was one person who will go on who go unnamed You know.

563
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:15,567
Speaker 1: and it's like 90% of the arguments came from 10% of the dwarves.

564
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:21,190
Speaker 0: I'm just saying you know it's hard to You know if people are gonna be fighting with me.

565
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,793
Speaker 0: It's like look.

566
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:24,023
Speaker 0: I don't really want to you know be doing that.

567
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:25,710
Speaker 0: the other thing there is your D&D G.

568
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:49,949
Speaker 1: you're forgetting a very important aspect of burning wheel game mastering even any game mastering is that you've got to Even if you just make up an obstacle off the top your head based on nothing if you say For then immediately everyone in the room and the meta level knows you just fucking made that up And you didn't have any basis for it, and they feel a little bit cheated Because they feel like all right.

569
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:58,200
Speaker 1: He made up an obstacle so it didn't really matter what my skill was because he probably made it up by looking at my skill And then deciding what percent chance he wanted me of succeeding or something like that.

570
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:05,128
Speaker 1: so they feel subconsciously like advancement won't matter Or that you're just arbitrarily setting them up to succeed or fail or something like that.

571
00:36:06,191 --> 00:36:09,747
Speaker 1: You've got to always sound like you had it written down like you knew.

572
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:16,510
Speaker 1: someone's like What's the obstacle for me to dig a 10 foot by 10 foot square into the side of this basalt?

573
00:36:17,013 --> 00:36:19,750
Speaker 1: Like wall and you got to look at them and say five.

574
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,295
Speaker 0: I think the other problem.

575
00:36:21,335 --> 00:36:25,470
Speaker 1: you say four plus one abs because of and just say some gibberish.

576
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,179
Speaker 0: I think the other problem right is it a lot of times.

577
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:31,290
Speaker 0: It'll be like it won't just be a boolean situation, right?

578
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,550
Speaker 0: It'll be a. how well do you want to do with situations?

579
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,998
Speaker 0: He knows, but it's not an open-ended test right.

580
00:36:36,058 --> 00:36:37,061
Speaker 0: so it's like okay.

581
00:36:37,523 --> 00:36:39,610
Speaker 0: You know you want to do what you know?

582
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,910
Speaker 0: You want to climb the tree, okay?

583
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,108
Speaker 0: Well do you want to climb the tree?

584
00:36:42,692 --> 00:36:51,953
Speaker 0: Like you know without hurting yourself at all and get all the way to the top quickly or do you want to get the top of the jar you making a mistake though burning wheel handles that already with the you Know working quickly.

585
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:58,896
Speaker 1: options if you and so if someone wants to do something they say I want to dig a cave this long I want to climb a tree or whatever.

586
00:36:58,936 --> 00:37:05,949
Speaker 1: I think what you should do is just say OBS whatever and By the degree of their failure decide how dire the consequences are if they fail

587
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like and

588
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:10,730
Speaker 1: otherwise pretty much give them whatever they wanted if they succeed yeah

589
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,855
Speaker 0: But it's like I'm sort of you know.

590
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:16,790
Speaker 0: it's like if I give someone options like you know you want to do it better Don't get my desire.

591
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:21,238
Speaker 0: And if you want to do it less good Then the OBS is lower than what they do.

592
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:25,112
Speaker 0: is they just pick the OBS that they want to succeed at and not really you Know.

593
00:37:25,394 --> 00:37:26,583
Speaker 1: now vote that the way around.

594
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:29,144
Speaker 1: that is very simple Arthur and beliefs.

595
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:37,849
Speaker 1: if The way I do it is anytime I give someone an obstacle at least when I run like the sword Which is the only burning wheel I've run in recent memory at all or ever.

596
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:40,959
Speaker 1: If they write they I give them an obstacle.

597
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:53,562
Speaker 1: if they balk at it at all I say well And I give them a lower obstacle that is in direct conflict with one of their beliefs or instincts And there is never a third option if they want a third option.

598
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:53,984
Speaker 1: That's it.

599
00:37:54,526 --> 00:37:55,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that's part of it.

600
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,450
Speaker 0: It's like you know these sort of like degrees of success on a lot of things.

601
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,739
Speaker 0: It's like they didn't really care as long as they got.

602
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:02,522
Speaker 0: you know something.

603
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:07,702
Speaker 1: let's remember burning wheel gives you the option to of They'll succeed in the basic way no matter what.

604
00:38:08,023 --> 00:38:13,710
Speaker 1: if they want to succeed and excel They have to beat the obstacle or they have to give themselves obstacle penalties.

605
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:23,007
Speaker 1: You know depending on the skill like with my masoning and all that if I want to make a crazy awesome wall There's rules for that saying ad-ops too, and then the wall is this much better.

606
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:30,630
Speaker 0: Yep The other thing is that because everyone's dwarves is like all these like extra exception rules that we often forget.

607
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:31,948
Speaker 1: Scott forgets.

608
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:35,782
Speaker 0: Many people forgot many rules quite oft.

609
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:37,108
Speaker 0: You know that many.

610
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,232
Speaker 1: It's pretty much.

611
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:42,088
Speaker 1: There's a speed cap on dwarves and dwarves are bearded mm-hmm.

612
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:44,316
Speaker 0: There's a lot more rules than that.

613
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:46,243
Speaker 0: There's like dwarven tools.

614
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,226
Speaker 0: Give you plus one.

615
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:48,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I booked Yeah.

616
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:59,690
Speaker 0: But also like if you want to make something that is dwarven Quality then the OBS is like plus two and if you want to make something where the OBS to make it is higher than

617
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,475
Speaker 1: Three then

618
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:05,430
Speaker 0: you need a workshop, and then to make a workshop you need and it's like this whole.

619
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:11,540
Speaker 0: There's a lot of like all these little things to remember that are sort of outside The default rules and you're not you know.

620
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,705
Speaker 0: it's hard to remember everything.

621
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,730
Speaker 1: if I were you I would have made it.

622
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,525
Speaker 1: I would have made a burning dwarf DGM sheet before I started with all I did.

623
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,536
Speaker 0: I studied it But I didn't remember every see.

624
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:23,014
Speaker 0: I would have printed it out and some of the things are hiding in the book in places I didn't notice.

625
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:25,210
Speaker 1: there's something visceral about having a DM sheet.

626
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:30,009
Speaker 1: I've always I have trouble doing any sort of game mastering without some sort of screen in front of me.

627
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:36,059
Speaker 1: in D&D that screen was just so I could lie about die rolls, but Yeah, I don't need to lie about any die rolls.

628
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,345
Speaker 0: I just roll right out on the table.

629
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:37,989
Speaker 0: as you can see it.

630
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:39,186
Speaker 1: It's interesting.

631
00:39:39,226 --> 00:39:39,348
Speaker 1: how?

632
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,361
Speaker 1: The the flow of our game basically went straight along to.

633
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:45,870
Speaker 1: we arrived and everyone bickers just burning wheel.

634
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:46,513
Speaker 1: And what do you do?

635
00:39:46,754 --> 00:39:48,561
Speaker 1: have a duel of wits immediately no matter what.

636
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:50,389
Speaker 1: and then?

637
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:57,790
Speaker 1: Adversary adversity forced us to oh shit We got to get our act together or we're all gonna die and then we succeeded at something.

638
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:58,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing is it.

639
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:04,014
Speaker 0: now that I've got like everyone's you know I sort of figured out all the characters I can totally just like.

640
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:10,150
Speaker 0: I'm gonna come in and just gonna bring like multiple simultaneous horrible conflicts right like boom.

641
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:11,769
Speaker 0: I'm gonna come out with it like that.

642
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,736
Speaker 0: Yeah What are just gonna be like off fuck?

643
00:40:14,057 --> 00:40:21,933
Speaker 1: one option to whenever you give someone a role where they might fail is to let them Succeed straight up, but not in time Mmm.

644
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:26,749
Speaker 1: You know you succeed in excavating the hole, but so-and-so already starved to death.

645
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:28,161
Speaker 0: Planning product.

646
00:40:28,221 --> 00:40:29,189
Speaker 0: you have someone died.

647
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:31,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you get my drift.

648
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:40,630
Speaker 1: Yeah But what I want from you out there the listeners is that we're trying this grand experiment of striking the earth with burning dwarves in a wheel of fortresses.

649
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:41,992
Speaker 1: We're gonna.

650
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:45,484
Speaker 1: Did you post our game report in the secret forum or the public forum?

651
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:46,046
Speaker 0: I don't know.

652
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:47,290
Speaker 1: we should post it.

653
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,990
Speaker 1: I think we'll make a thread about it in the public forum.

654
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:52,701
Speaker 1: I want all of you to form burning wheel dwarf fortress games.

655
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:54,246
Speaker 1: just use the straight-up rules.

656
00:40:54,587 --> 00:40:59,704
Speaker 0: it just works and I yeah all you have to do is you know you just take the burning wheel rules.

657
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:10,024
Speaker 0: you make every character You know dwarfs, and then you just say all right everyone you go out into the middle of nowhere and to start a fortress Go and you just use the burning wheel.

658
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:10,730
Speaker 0: rules straight up.

659
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,797
Speaker 0: You don't even really think about dwarf fortress that much.

660
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:17,174
Speaker 1: you see all those crazy stories like bronze murder people talk about like the epic Fortress game.

661
00:41:17,757 --> 00:41:25,342
Speaker 1: if you are unable or unwilling to play dwarf fortress You can basically have the exact same thing by using burning wheel and your friends brains.

662
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:28,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know I want to hear your stories.

663
00:41:30,712 --> 00:41:32,920
Speaker 0: I'm sure people will tell you their stories now.

664
00:41:33,322 --> 00:41:35,210
Speaker 1: on a completely unrelated dwarf tack.

665
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:48,603
Speaker 1: We we were talking about dwarf fortress and some Scott was complaining about how his dwarf fortress game that he was playing Was really really really laggy like Unduly laggy even with the the admittedly bad code of dwarf fortress.

666
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:50,849
Speaker 1: like it was just way too laggy.

667
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:57,210
Speaker 1: and Someone made some comment like oh, there's probably a city of undead stuff living under you that tends to slow the game down.

668
00:41:57,571 --> 00:42:03,274
Speaker 1: Nope, no no city of undead, but even if it were I think I said something like well That's just really bad coding.

669
00:42:03,796 --> 00:42:06,484
Speaker 1: nothing should slow down the dwarves like nothing.

670
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:14,730
Speaker 1: meta should slow down your dwarves The dwarves making decisions or like making your hallways too narrow or something like that shouldn't slow down the game.

671
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,310
Speaker 0: The game is just really poorly coded.

672
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,370
Speaker 0: We've discussed this even when we had the creator of the dwarf fortress on the show.

673
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,309
Speaker 0: We asked him like why don't you open source this so people can fix it up?

674
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:24,914
Speaker 0: You know and he just won't.

675
00:42:25,316 --> 00:42:28,327
Speaker 1: and yep, but the conversation went in a direction.

676
00:42:28,548 --> 00:42:29,431
Speaker 1: and finally we're like.

677
00:42:30,153 --> 00:42:39,928
Speaker 1: you know what we always say things like this and our motto is usually put up or shut up or Put up and get and then trick someone else to continue putting up and then shut up.

678
00:42:41,113 --> 00:42:46,210
Speaker 1: But someone suggested it and the discussion happened, and we now have a geek nights coding Club.

679
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,354
Speaker 1: We'll see how long this goes.

680
00:42:47,455 --> 00:42:56,884
Speaker 1: but a bunch of listeners you and you know Scott kind of laid the groundwork are trying to Make a dwarf fortress like game completely open source MIT license.

681
00:42:56,984 --> 00:42:58,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is it's like.

682
00:42:59,971 --> 00:43:01,215
Speaker 0: This is one of those situations.

683
00:43:01,255 --> 00:43:02,941
Speaker 0: I think that's like dude, bro, right.

684
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,549
Speaker 0: It's where flame war begets work.

685
00:43:06,399 --> 00:43:06,868
Speaker 0: You know it.

686
00:43:07,532 --> 00:43:14,808
Speaker 0: I think this is really sort of like the rule and perhaps the solution on the internet right is if you see some flame War or you know typical internet in this.

687
00:43:15,451 --> 00:43:17,899
Speaker 0: Basically your choices should be right.

688
00:43:18,481 --> 00:43:23,678
Speaker 0: if you care about whatever this flame war is Then you have to do right.

689
00:43:23,738 --> 00:43:30,377
Speaker 0: you have to do some creativity or some work and that wins the flame war like you know Making dude, bro that wins right.

690
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:37,060
Speaker 0: or you know if you're arguing with someone in an open source project somewhere, and they say The colonel should use this scheduler.

691
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,648
Speaker 0: Oh the colonel should use this scheduler.

692
00:43:39,412 --> 00:43:42,990
Speaker 0: Whoever writes the code, and it works is probably gonna win right?

693
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,738
Speaker 0: so this is yet another instance of.

694
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:53,289
Speaker 0: we were saying look dwarf fortress is coded like shit and Someone in the forum was trying to say it wasn't and I don't know why they thought it wasn't because it is.

695
00:43:53,851 --> 00:44:01,097
Speaker 0: It's pretty obvious to bring anyone who knows anything about software that the code of dwarf fortress is probably like the worst in the universe And it was coded properly.

696
00:44:01,117 --> 00:44:07,489
Speaker 0: it probably runs so fast you couldn't even see the dwarves moving around Like you know really sim C to 2000 on cheetah mode on a modern PC.

697
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:12,410
Speaker 0: And it's like and it's like a thousand years fast by in like a second because it's so fast.

698
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:16,222
Speaker 0: That's probably how fast again dwarf fortress would run if it was coded properly.

699
00:44:16,262 --> 00:44:20,937
Speaker 0: so we just started Kind of making it kind of sorta.

700
00:44:21,037 --> 00:44:25,010
Speaker 1: yep the working title is still project door if we haven't decided what dwarf stands for yet.

701
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:26,729
Speaker 0: No, no it doesn't have to stand for anything.

702
00:44:27,472 --> 00:44:30,241
Speaker 0: But you know it's not like we're trying to compete with dwarf fortress right?

703
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:32,569
Speaker 0: we're primarily you know we're sort of.

704
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:37,830
Speaker 0: you know We're trying to learn different algorithms because you know dwarf fortress actually is a pretty good.

705
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,690
Speaker 0: It has so many different systems the water flowing system.

706
00:44:42,252 --> 00:44:46,950
Speaker 0: You know the the dwarves moving around system the dwarven AI system.

707
00:44:47,471 --> 00:44:50,820
Speaker 0: You know animals moving around caves caving in.

708
00:44:51,161 --> 00:44:52,263
Speaker 0: you know all sorts of.

709
00:44:52,364 --> 00:44:58,538
Speaker 0: you know making things out of different materials terrain Generation also weather.

710
00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:00,805
Speaker 0: it's got so much stuff going on right.

711
00:45:00,845 --> 00:45:06,070
Speaker 0: all these different systems are actually You know make for really interesting algorithms that need to be written.

712
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:22,877
Speaker 0: You know pathfinding and rendering and all sorts of stuff, so if you want to learn different computer science stuff You know making a dwarf fortress like game is a good opportunity to learn all these sort of different fundamental and not so fundamental Algorithms and computer science techniques.

713
00:45:23,338 --> 00:45:31,349
Speaker 1: so even if this project doesn't go anywhere a lot of the listeners gonna learn a lot about coding And like so even right now I mean a lot of them have learned about git at least a little bit.

714
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:35,110
Speaker 0: That's the thing is I made a how-to to set up the Python environment.

715
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:40,608
Speaker 0: I made some screencasts there on YouTube, but I got to make some git how-tos because people don't know how to use it.

716
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:43,299
Speaker 1: really I'm not even I mean even at work.

717
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,010
Speaker 1: We still I use subversion for everything.

718
00:45:45,171 --> 00:45:48,630
Speaker 0: No, so bad you can use git to talk to subversion, then you don't need subversion.

719
00:45:49,024 --> 00:45:55,710
Speaker 0: Yep If you know if the other person refuses to make a git repository you can just use the git client and then with subversion anyway.

720
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:56,816
Speaker 1: but I mean for now.

721
00:45:57,218 --> 00:46:08,310
Speaker 1: at best I see this being a a Long-term project of becoming eventually a generic fantasy world emulator I don't know if it'll even be a fantasy world, but you know or just a world out an object emulator.

722
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:12,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I'm thinking like maybe we should just make an engine and then you could make the game.

723
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:13,150
Speaker 0: it like you know.

724
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,718
Speaker 0: Take the NS2 path.

725
00:46:14,778 --> 00:46:17,270
Speaker 0: if you make an engine into the game is written in Lua or something.

726
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:17,491
Speaker 0: You know.

727
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:18,274
Speaker 0: the game is separate.

728
00:46:18,616 --> 00:46:23,437
Speaker 0: so then people can make all sorts of dwarf fortress style ish games You know of their choosing.

729
00:46:23,497 --> 00:46:26,734
Speaker 0: maybe elf castle yeah, maybe have like you know some plugins You know.

730
00:46:26,754 --> 00:46:28,429
Speaker 0: so people can make a plugins for it.

731
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:29,192
Speaker 0: You know like.

732
00:46:29,212 --> 00:46:31,017
Speaker 0: oh, you know here's a weather plug-in.

733
00:46:31,077 --> 00:46:35,949
Speaker 0: Here's a I don't know a. cars driving around on roads plug-in.

734
00:46:36,413 --> 00:46:37,929
Speaker 0: Here's a. here's a train plug-in.

735
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:38,592
Speaker 0: I'm mostly

736
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:54,950
Speaker 1: interested in the procedural content generation side of it like the idea that you have Area like areas of a world you know maybe theoretically an infinite world or a large world that are Unexplored and does not computed or computed like abstracted from the point beyond which you've ever experienced them.

737
00:46:55,572 --> 00:47:08,492
Speaker 1: But then once you as a once a human sees or interacts with directly any part that was unexplored it is procedurally generated and then from that point forward is persistent and Part of the world.

738
00:47:08,854 --> 00:47:11,141
Speaker 1: so the world only grows as a human has seen it.

739
00:47:11,181 --> 00:47:16,825
Speaker 1: because until a human sees something there is no reason To actually simulate anything beyond that boundary.

740
00:47:17,207 --> 00:47:24,990
Speaker 1: you might as well Just abstract it and remember everything you've abstracted so that can be made consistent with whatever is quote unquote discovered behind it.

741
00:47:25,616 --> 00:47:26,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right so get on that.

742
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:30,262
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm saying like that because the whole point of my losing should be fun.

743
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:35,742
Speaker 1: the first time I ran into Pax was the whole idea That procedural content generation is the holy grail right now.

744
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:37,629
Speaker 1: That'll change everything like it'll.

745
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:44,774
Speaker 0: just it'll That love FPS game that was procedural and that totally did not work out, so yeah Well because it wasn't.

746
00:47:45,337 --> 00:47:48,534
Speaker 1: it didn't do everything well enough and in the right directions Mmm.

747
00:47:48,956 --> 00:47:50,484
Speaker 0: You even play it did you know?

748
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:51,630
Speaker 0: so what do you know about it?

749
00:47:51,891 --> 00:47:52,534
Speaker 1: Clearly it didn't.

750
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:53,037
Speaker 1: you didn't like.

751
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:56,567
Speaker 0: you seem to like to make a lot of claims about things you'd have been played And don't have you played it?

752
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:57,774
Speaker 0: I played the outfit.

753
00:47:57,814 --> 00:48:00,924
Speaker 1: it procedurally generate an entire world procedure.

754
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:02,630
Speaker 0: you generated the game the entire game map.

755
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:04,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, and was it any fun to play on?

756
00:48:05,078 --> 00:48:06,062
Speaker 1: is anyone talking about it?

757
00:48:06,102 --> 00:48:08,510
Speaker 0: still it wasn't fun for many reasons.

758
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now it's probably gone.

759
00:48:10,618 --> 00:48:10,819
Speaker 0: No.

760
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:16,810
Speaker 1: It's around well gone as in no one plays it, but the hardcore elite I don't think anyone plays it then it's not around.

761
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,658
Speaker 1: That's like a tree falling in the woods by itself.

762
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,829
Speaker 1: if an xbox is alone in the woods turned on With one guy playing by himself is he really even there?

763
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:27,553
Speaker 0: maybe It depends.

764
00:48:27,573 --> 00:48:28,636
Speaker 0: is he online I mean.

765
00:48:29,278 --> 00:48:35,667
Speaker 1: so we've basically stricken the earth in two completely opposite directions And they both involve dwarves in some capacity.

766
00:48:35,688 --> 00:48:45,539
Speaker 0: yeah I just want people to remember that we know when there is internet arguing you should either counter with making something or Just don't and then the internet will be fixed.

767
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,325
Speaker 0: so we can fix the whole internet.

768
00:48:47,345 --> 00:48:50,980
Speaker 1: people and if you want to Help us out with this project dwarf thing.

769
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:51,823
Speaker 1: We'll send a link.

770
00:48:51,864 --> 00:48:52,667
Speaker 1: Just you know join in.

771
00:48:52,728 --> 00:48:53,210
Speaker 1: it's totally free.

772
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,376
Speaker 1: It's open as MIT.

773
00:48:54,698 --> 00:49:01,709
Speaker 1: if you think as long as your code doesn't suck And you know what if you're if you realize the world dumbasses you can just fork it and go nuts.

774
00:49:02,252 --> 00:49:03,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, do whatever.

775
00:49:03,518 --> 00:49:05,206
Speaker 1: God forking a project this early.

776
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:08,909
Speaker 1: It's kind of That's like forking hello world.

777
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:17,940
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

778
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,855
