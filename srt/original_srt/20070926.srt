1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,285
Speaker 0: Well, if you couldn't tell from the lack of music, it's not a normal episode of geek nights Which means it's that time again.

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,935
Speaker 1: You're not even putting the music in the specials anymore.

3
00:00:09,296 --> 00:00:11,042
Speaker 0: I've never put music in the special I don't know.

4
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:14,860
Speaker 1: I don't listen to the specials because they're not so specials have never had music in them.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,267
Speaker 0: They're just we start talking.

6
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:20,909
Speaker 1: No, okay, then take that Specials take that internet fair.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,495
Speaker 0: But yeah, I'm out of town.

8
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:28,900
Speaker 0: So this Episode was actually recorded last night and there probably won't be a show tomorrow night.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,517
Speaker 0: Let's Scott and Emily decide to figure out how to use my computer to record something.

10
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:33,542
Speaker 1: if I did I would just.

11
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:39,739
Speaker 1: it would just be low audio quality and I would just push record and then Stop and then make an mp3 with no editing.

12
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:42,018
Speaker 1: So that that's what it would be.

13
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:45,100
Speaker 0: But yeah, I know we have a lot of new listeners coming in periodically.

14
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:50,640
Speaker 0: But if you've never listened to geek nights before you might want to check out any other episode before you listen to this one.

15
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:51,900
Speaker 0: This is what we call a special.

16
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:56,400
Speaker 0: Special is code on geek nights for we were too lazy to make a real show.

17
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:04,355
Speaker 1: So we made a show that takes a quarter the effort in half the time unlike specials on television Which means they put in more effort more time and more money to try to get new listeners.

18
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:08,440
Speaker 1: This is laziness to keep existing listeners.

19
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:17,260
Speaker 0: I mean we could have a very special geek nights But that would mean like Scott locked himself in a refrigerator in a dump yard and almost died and then we all learned something.

20
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:19,839
Speaker 0: All right, like that episode of punky Brewster.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,107
Speaker 1: I never watched punky Brewster ever.

22
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:24,880
Speaker 1: I've heard of it and I know it's some show but that's all I know.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,896
Speaker 0: You don't know about the tonight on a very special name of show.

24
00:01:29,117 --> 00:01:29,960
Speaker 1: I do know about that.

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,490
Speaker 0: Yes, cuz punky Brewster I believe started that.

26
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,700
Speaker 1: Oh punky Brewster's live-action show.

27
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:36,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never.

28
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,234
Speaker 1: I didn't know anything about.

29
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:39,300
Speaker 0: it was a live-action show.

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,680
Speaker 1: I never knew anything about it at all other than there was a show called punky Brewster that I never watched.

31
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:44,717
Speaker 0: I used to watch it as a kid.

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,591
Speaker 1: Well, it was on for 1984 to 86 and then again in 87 and 88 with some syndication.

33
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:54,393
Speaker 0: I watched a lot of reruns on channel 9.

34
00:01:54,393 --> 00:02:00,740
Speaker 0: I was watching elf I think during those times You know as a kid, I'd say that I watched some good stuff and some bad stuff.

35
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,806
Speaker 0: I mean I watched he-man.

36
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,677
Speaker 0: but now I know that he-man was terrible.

37
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:07,460
Speaker 1: Yeah Not I'm glad I watched it when I was a kid because when I was a kid was awesome.

38
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:11,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think the worst show I watched as a kid was small wonder.

39
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:12,420
Speaker 1: I don't know what that is.

40
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:14,027
Speaker 0: It's not good.

41
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:14,811
Speaker 0: All right.

42
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:16,500
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'll take your word for it.

43
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:30,631
Speaker 0: So instead of doing you know, it's a special if we can do whatever we want But it is anime manga comic night and it just so happens that over the last weekend We got an email from a listener that Scott wanted to talk about it right away But we decided to wait until the night where it was topical.

44
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:33,984
Speaker 0: and now that we're doing a special it seems like the perfect day To broach this topic.

45
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:34,265
Speaker 0: Well,

46
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:45,340
Speaker 1: not only is this pretty like the specifics of this email very topical But I have a rant that has been building up inside of me and I've been letting loose little by little

47
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:55,853
Speaker 0: Mostly because unlike me Scott hangs out on the comic geek speak forums and they're cool people and he hangs out there But I think he disagrees with 75% of the opinions posited there.

48
00:02:55,934 --> 00:03:01,314
Speaker 0: perhaps but like I Wager that he is that guy in those forums.

49
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:05,129
Speaker 0: I mean, you know probably yeah I'm definitely that you all know that there's that guy in our forums.

50
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,076
Speaker 0: I think you know exactly who that guy is.

51
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,879
Speaker 0: Well, uh Anyway, everyone's thinking am I that guy?

52
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:20,060
Speaker 1: But anyway, this is rant that's been building and this doesn't target that rant directly But it is encompassed by my rant and therefore is an excuse for me to let loose.

53
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:23,420
Speaker 0: I'm going to read this email in its entirety before we come in.

54
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,409
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a special and we're only doing one geek back.

55
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,872
Speaker 1: So why not?

56
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:26,274
Speaker 1: Yeah.

57
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:27,560
Speaker 0: Now the email is from Kate.

58
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:31,356
Speaker 0: You know in radio, it's like Kate from Iowa, but I have no idea where Kate's.

59
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,868
Speaker 1: from the internet Kate what don't manage you from Kate?

60
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:38,036
Speaker 0: It doesn't say at something at us dot something.

61
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:39,420
Speaker 0: I imagine it's in America.

62
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:51,240
Speaker 0: Anyway While I applaud the idea of not buying bootlegs and not pirating after something is licensed The real thing hurting anime DVD sales is people not buying DVDs.

63
00:03:53,082 --> 00:04:03,771
Speaker 0: The quote/unquote rule of fan subs is if you enjoyed watching the show You should buy it not if you loved it not if it changed your life But if you just liked it and were entertained.

64
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:07,855
Speaker 0: no matter what the u.s Anime industry is not like the Japanese industry.

65
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:11,913
Speaker 0: the u.s Doesn't get to rely on advertisers for their revenue for the most part.

66
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:13,680
Speaker 0: They have to rely on us the fans.

67
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:18,720
Speaker 0: So while renting anime is all well and good to see if you like the show shouldn't the same rules apply?

68
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:22,071
Speaker 0: Because otherwise while it might not make people feel bad.

69
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:24,520
Speaker 0: It is just as hurtful to the industry.

70
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:29,780
Speaker 0: I feel like I just wish into a what's-it-pepper box voice, then I just keep going is it?

71
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,990
Speaker 0: And Since most DVDs are well-priced even cheap.

72
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,772
Speaker 0: It's not too hard.

73
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:36,556
Speaker 0: I also hear complaints.

74
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:37,860
Speaker 0: You spelled here wrong.

75
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:47,838
Speaker 0: Kate I'm sorry about the price of US anime DVDs, but if you really think about it $30 is a good price for four or five episodes.

76
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember paying $30 for just two episodes of cowboy bebop on VHS.

77
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:55,178
Speaker 0: I also remember those times.

78
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:56,080
Speaker 0: those were dark days.

79
00:04:57,025 --> 00:05:00,000
Speaker 0: Now I'm not saying that is right, but anime is the niche market.

80
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:05,380
Speaker 0: So it seems ludicrous to expect the same price on a DVD of the latest spider-man movie on DVD.

81
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:10,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, what I'm getting at is that we all need to buy more anime period Kate.

82
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:18,520
Speaker 1: Alright Kate I got like I could have stopped it like ten different places in your email and said how dumb you are.

83
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:20,366
Speaker 0: Not so much dumb.

84
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:23,080
Speaker 1: No, no, yeah, but how you are wrong.

85
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:27,097
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get my words in edgewise cuz I think once Scott gets going he's not gonna stop.

86
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:29,207
Speaker 1: maybe Let me try to dig up this email.

87
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:31,699
Speaker 1: I shut my laptop so I can go back into it.

88
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,360
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I do find it funny.

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,166
Speaker 0: I mean I got to make fun of any email I read.

90
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:39,020
Speaker 0: but the real thing hurting anime DVD sales is people not buying DVDs.

91
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,280
Speaker 0: That is a beautiful example of the kind of marketing speak that I used to hear at IBM at like business meetings.

92
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,920
Speaker 1: The real problem is like people have made frames.

93
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:54,080
Speaker 0: They would say a long sentence that basically said sales are down because people aren't buying our products.

94
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,926
Speaker 0: Wow, yeah, that would that was.

95
00:05:57,047 --> 00:06:00,840
Speaker 0: that was beautiful and transcendent, but let's ignore fan subs.

96
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:03,159
Speaker 0: We're not gonna talk about fan subs at all.

97
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:09,100
Speaker 0: Let's just talk about either you're pirating something illegally or you were watching it legally.

98
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:13,439
Speaker 0: So anime is available in the US on DVD and I can purchase it.

99
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:18,680
Speaker 0: It is perfectly legal for me to rent it and that has been upheld in courts time and time and time again.

100
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,535
Speaker 0: The rental industry is perfectly legal.

101
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:29,148
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And also the copies I am renting were purchased by the company that is renting them out And they have the full legal right to do that.

102
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:31,015
Speaker 0: It was paid for and it is done.

103
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:44,086
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm If it is available legally at that whatever price or whatever means then I don't think anyone can be morally impinged upon by Purchasing it or consuming it in that way.

104
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,692
Speaker 0: I mean just straight up.

105
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:48,120
Speaker 0: I can't make the argument more directly than that.

106
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,800
Speaker 0: Watching it in Netflix or watching it on Blockbuster is identical to purchasing it as far as I'm concerned.

107
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:58,073
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not make sense to me?

108
00:06:58,636 --> 00:07:08,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, and The real issue I mean aside from that just one renting it still generates revenue because if something's rented a lot Netflix in those places have to buy more copies of it.

109
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,800
Speaker 0: and I know for a fact that anime fans ruin DVDs.

110
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:16,055
Speaker 1: I can't tell you how many times we got scratch DVDs from Netflix and we send them back.

111
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:23,740
Speaker 1: and I must assume that if the Demand for that DVD remains the same because anime fans keep renting it and scratching it that Netflix is buying more copies.

112
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,386
Speaker 0: So but it's only people.

113
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:27,735
Speaker 1: you're hurting the anime industry because you're not scratching.

114
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:28,699
Speaker 1: your Netflix is enough.

115
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:31,500
Speaker 1: That's your Netflix is more to help the anime industry.

116
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:37,275
Speaker 0: But I mean that issue aside if someone has the choice of getting something illegal or getting it legally.

117
00:07:37,636 --> 00:07:38,658
Speaker 0: getting it legally wins.

118
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:51,380
Speaker 0: if Someone has two means of getting something legally say buying it at full Manufacturers suggested retail price from the company directly or Buying it super cheap used from deep discount DVD.

119
00:07:52,221 --> 00:08:01,991
Speaker 1: There's no difference between those two options or getting it in like a box for ten bucks at a convention years Later or renting it from Netflix or borrowing it from a friend.

120
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:03,976
Speaker 0: or I watch cowboy bebop.

121
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:05,140
Speaker 0: I'm done with it here.

122
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:10,100
Speaker 0: Take my DVDs I don't need them and then you watch it and then you give them to someone else to watch them and we just pass them.

123
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,589
Speaker 0: Now notice not copying not ripping but just giving.

124
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:15,855
Speaker 0: yeah trading or selling used.

125
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:17,059
Speaker 1: what's wrong with that?

126
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:24,946
Speaker 1: this part This Kate seems to think that if you watch something and you like it you are somehow Obligated to spend money on it.

127
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:27,774
Speaker 1: Even if you wouldn't have spent let's like here.

128
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:35,600
Speaker 1: Let's pretend there's an anime a right anime a comes out and I watch the fan subs, but it wasn't that great.

129
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,591
Speaker 1: But I watched him anyway.

130
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:42,236
Speaker 1: cuz I was bored Kate seems to think I should go and buy the DVDs, even if I'm never gonna watch the show again now.

131
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,295
Speaker 1: Let's pretend that that same show came out and for whatever reason I wasn't bored.

132
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:48,800
Speaker 1: So I never watched the fan subs.

133
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,873
Speaker 1: I still wouldn't have bought the DVDs ever.

134
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:57,916
Speaker 1: There is no situation Where I would have bought the DVDs not like the fan subs prevented me from buying the DVDs.

135
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:02,900
Speaker 1: if I was gonna buy it I was gonna buy it and the fan subs aren't gonna change whether I was gonna buy it or not.

136
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:08,959
Speaker 1: So just cuz I like something I'm not under any obligation to spend money on it.

137
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:13,669
Speaker 1: If I'm gonna spend money on it I'm gonna and if I'm not I'm not.

138
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:20,443
Speaker 1: and you're not gonna say oh you're guilty cuz you didn't spend money You're not guilty.

139
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:24,394
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean before we get into the deeper issues here it is there's.

140
00:09:24,495 --> 00:09:37,380
Speaker 0: I just think of it this way Practically from a purely practical rational standpoint ignore morals or anything else Even though I think the moral argument is clear in this case as well because you are purchasing it legally or watching it legally

141
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:40,045
Speaker 1: Well from a law and morals and I say but

142
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:47,149
Speaker 0: even then from a purely rational perspective Say I wanted to watch a show So I rent it all and I watch it all.

143
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:51,879
Speaker 0: if the show wasn't that good and I door I just don't feel like I'm ever gonna watch it again.

144
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:59,700
Speaker 0: What purpose does purchasing a physical meet a good that had to be manufactured and then letting it take up space in my house serve?

145
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:12,113
Speaker 0: What if I do buy all the anime that I liked just to support people but then I just sell that anime on eBay or I just give it away or I throw it away a Waste plastic and paper and your money.

146
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:13,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, it wastes energy.

147
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:17,880
Speaker 0: There's no point to buying something I've already seen unless I want to show it to someone else or watch it again.

148
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,485
Speaker 0: And honestly a lot of anime.

149
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:20,528
Speaker 0: if I want to watch it again.

150
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,554
Speaker 0: I'll just Netflix it again.

151
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:24,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's sadly enough.

152
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:37,660
Speaker 1: Now the deeper issue a deeper issue is this It seems to think it seems to me that what Kate is asking people to do is Basically treat the anime company like a charity.

153
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,888
Speaker 1: Well, the anime company is in need that you.

154
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:51,980
Speaker 1: they do something we like and therefore out of the good of our hearts Even if we don't want the product they're selling we should give them our money just because we like them so much.

155
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:54,007
Speaker 0: Now it's not just anime.

156
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:56,416
Speaker 0: I mean I want to touch on the really deeper issue here.

157
00:10:56,477 --> 00:11:03,970
Speaker 0: Yep in particularly anime manga Science-fiction fandom this seems comics

158
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:18,470
Speaker 1: any niche geeky market Mostly the niche geeky markets where there is a professional industry of some sort, you know, like indie comic books or Small toy companies that make cool statues

159
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:24,011
Speaker 0: there seems to be in the in this whole market a culture of You should support

160
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,240
Speaker 1: even like indie music.

161
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:32,300
Speaker 0: Yep You should support the scene and support the industry even if you don't actually like the individual things in the industry.

162
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,819
Speaker 0: You know, hey palladium is going out of business.

163
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:39,820
Speaker 0: Everyone who cares about gaming should purchase palladium books to keep them from going out of business.

164
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:43,258
Speaker 0: Hey indie comic artist X isn't doing so.

165
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:47,297
Speaker 0: well Buy his comics even if you don't like him just to support him.

166
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:50,107
Speaker 1: or hey Indie comic artist has a new comic.

167
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:56,634
Speaker 1: you like you should buy the monthly issues that are full of ads instead of the trade that You actually want or else the trade might never come about.

168
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,760
Speaker 0: I think that's the worst thing.

169
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:12,412
Speaker 0: That's the worst one that bothers me more than anything in the world is when some comic fan tells me that by not purchasing these gigantic poorly printed annoying hard to store Expensive monthlies or weeklies or whatever.

170
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:13,820
Speaker 0: that is a pain in the ass.

171
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:23,340
Speaker 0: I just want to throw them away when I'm done with them and waiting for the you know Rational format the book the bound book that has the entire story in it with no ads.

172
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:25,989
Speaker 1: That by waiting less money for more pages.

173
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:29,300
Speaker 0: I am somehow the reason that the comic industry is not doing well.

174
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:43,060
Speaker 0: maybe The fact that the reason the way they're making money is by having to sell the product that no one wants and people the people Who buy that product buy it out of charity as opposed to out of actual desire is the actual problem.

175
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:54,913
Speaker 1: Yes, the main point here is that you should never under any circumstance blame the Consumer for the failure of the business.

176
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:59,211
Speaker 1: if a business is not making money It is not the consumers fault.

177
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:04,371
Speaker 1: in a capitalist society 110% of the time it is the business's fault.

178
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:09,749
Speaker 1: if a TV needs money because no one's buying DVDs It's a TV's fault for selling DVDs shittily.

179
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:16,130
Speaker 1: if some indie comic artist doesn't make money because I don't buy the money Monthly's that's his fault for being stupid and printing monthly's.

180
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,214
Speaker 1: that he lost money on it.

181
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:23,112
Speaker 1: if some guy Makes like some fan film and that he doesn't make his money back.

182
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:31,120
Speaker 1: if palladium books is going out of business It's because they're making a product no one wants or selling it improperly or failing to market it properly.

183
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:33,271
Speaker 1: Well, it's not my fault for not buying it.

184
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:35,019
Speaker 1: This is not a fucking charity.

185
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,783
Speaker 1: Businesses are not charity.

186
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:37,846
Speaker 1: if I'm gonna give to charity.

187
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:40,252
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give to poor starving kids in Africa.

188
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:45,608
Speaker 1: palladium books or ATV films Marvel Comics are not charities.

189
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:46,732
Speaker 1: They are businesses.

190
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,634
Speaker 1: if they don't have money.

191
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:48,617
Speaker 1: It's their fault.

192
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:50,228
Speaker 1: if they go out of business I don't give a shit.

193
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:51,279
Speaker 1: It's not my problem.

194
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,856
Speaker 0: Damn, I knew you had your aunt and I saw it coming But I actually had to turn you down because the compressor didn't know what to do.

195
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:04,653
Speaker 1: Ah, man Don't tell me that we should support someone.

196
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:07,911
Speaker 1: if someone can't support themselves That's their fault.

197
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,507
Speaker 1: if they want my money They should make something I want.

198
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:13,600
Speaker 1: I mean I am a person who pays money for things I want.

199
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:15,377
Speaker 0: I mean just the anime right?

200
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:15,640
Speaker 0: All right.

201
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,583
Speaker 0: So I want a Netflix stuff.

202
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:20,378
Speaker 0: the reason I Netflix most anime is because most anime is not that great.

203
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:21,843
Speaker 0: and you know Hey, that was cool.

204
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:28,378
Speaker 0: I like I didn't mind seeing that but I wasn't willing to pay more than practically nothing to see it like.

205
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:30,526
Speaker 0: There's a lot of anime that i'll buy.

206
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:35,289
Speaker 0: if the price is right pretty much once it gets to five dollars the dvd or less I'll buy almost anything.

207
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:36,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we bought freaking what?

208
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,953
Speaker 0: Grappler bocce god, well that was special.

209
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,720
Speaker 0: those ended up being pretty much free.

210
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,840
Speaker 1: I know I know but i'm saying like we bought like ko beast at a convention for cheap.

211
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:51,240
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have paid full price for ko beast but it's worth it to me to pay 10 bucks for it.

212
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's what i'm gonna pay plus.

213
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you make the point that Thirty dollars for four or five episodes of something is a good price.

214
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,339
Speaker 0: The thing is that was a good price eight years ago.

215
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,768
Speaker 0: Nowadays, I mean look at in america how dvds are sold.

216
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:10,222
Speaker 0: you buy the whole season of like csi or whatever for like 20 or 30 Bucks.

217
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:13,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could buy a season of futurama for less than 30 bucks.

218
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,540
Speaker 1: Why would I buy four episodes of an anime for 30 bucks?

219
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,480
Speaker 0: And the thing the other thing is, you know, why would I even buy the individuals?

220
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:28,596
Speaker 1: I should buy the box set the thin pack even which takes up less space in my house Precious space in my house because you know what rent costs a lot more than dvds plus.

221
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,379
Speaker 0: It's a fine line.

222
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:30,487
Speaker 0: I mean Where.

223
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:31,800
Speaker 0: what's the point at which it's not?

224
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,000
Speaker 0: Okay, I mean like I said before all right buying the the dvds as they come out every month for full price?

225
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:39,560
Speaker 0: What if I buy those dvds on sale?

226
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,228
Speaker 0: What if I buy those dvds used?

227
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,800
Speaker 0: what if I buy those dvds from a reseller?

228
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,165
Speaker 0: What's the point at which it's not if my friends lend them to me?

229
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:49,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, is lending.

230
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:53,819
Speaker 0: Okay legally it is Any anything legal shows it to me?

231
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:55,608
Speaker 0: What if an anime club runs a marathon?

232
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:57,960
Speaker 0: should anime clubs not run marathons of whole shows?

233
00:15:58,243 --> 00:15:59,839
Speaker 0: Because that prevents people from buying the show?

234
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:03,960
Speaker 1: Oh, no, even though the anime company gave them permission to have the marathon.

235
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:08,231
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I I don't think I have much to say.

236
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:10,980
Speaker 0: we've been repeating ourselves because I think the argument is pretty straightforward.

237
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:19,440
Speaker 1: Yes, basically all I want to do is all these people, you know, you you you're a geek You enjoy some niche product like an indie comic book, right?

238
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,002
Speaker 1: And it's.

239
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:28,595
Speaker 1: it would be sad for you to see that go because you know you like it And you will only get it as long as the person who makes it is making money.

240
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:30,060
Speaker 0: like example firefly.

241
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:32,689
Speaker 0: A lot of firefly fans, but that's a good example.

242
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:34,074
Speaker 1: I didn't think of because I don't like it.

243
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:35,780
Speaker 0: I loved firefly.

244
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:39,340
Speaker 0: I did not like it was just like amazing and to this day.

245
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,980
Speaker 0: I look back on it with such nostalgia and i've seen the whole thing like five times and i've watched the commentaries twice.

246
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:46,311
Speaker 0: Yep, it's great.

247
00:16:46,392 --> 00:16:49,569
Speaker 0: I loved it but We have a friend.

248
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:55,133
Speaker 0: Let's say his name is uh Jot, sonson, ha ha so good thing.

249
00:16:55,174 --> 00:17:08,460
Speaker 0: There are many people who share his name But people like him bought things About firefly that were not good like the firefly prequel to the movie comic which was absolute shit.

250
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:22,906
Speaker 0: And a lot of these people bought multiple copies of it and they bought multiple box sets of the dvds not for any practical reason but to somehow try to boost sales and like Support it and support firefly.

251
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:26,599
Speaker 1: coming back like some of them would buy two one to keep and one to lend to friends.

252
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,285
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

253
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:28,919
Speaker 0: No, there were people who bought three.

254
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,839
Speaker 0: There were one to keep one to lend to friends and one to support joss weeden.

255
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,020
Speaker 1: There are people who went to see the movie in the theaters multiple times or would buy extra tickets and only use one of them.

256
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,600
Speaker 0: You know sadly while I like the movie it wasn't I mean it was a good movie.

257
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,315
Speaker 0: It was a solid movie, but it wasn't super great.

258
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,710
Speaker 0: It wasn't as good as the show It tried to do too much with it, but there are people.

259
00:17:47,891 --> 00:18:04,530
Speaker 1: these people are buying products That they don't actually want the product or they're buying products They want but they're buying extras of it that they don't need or want or have room for simply because they want more of it and they they feel it.

260
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:08,706
Speaker 1: they're basically giving to charity and It's okay to give to charity.

261
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:15,380
Speaker 1: There is nothing wrong with giving to charity if you feel That your dollars are best spent, you know.

262
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:23,334
Speaker 1: If you let's say you're a mill you're bill gates and you love firefly and you you know If he spent all his money, he could have kept firefly afloat very easily.

263
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,036
Speaker 1: He's bill gates.

264
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,013
Speaker 1: if he did that That would have been an act of charity.

265
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:27,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't get me wrong.

266
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,313
Speaker 0: We're not saying you people out there can't support an industry.

267
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:36,980
Speaker 0: We're saying don't ever Ever get mad at anyone else for not doing the same thing.

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,325
Speaker 1: You're exactly what i'm saying.

269
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:45,874
Speaker 1: if bill gates decides to save firefly or support an indie comic artist That's fine And actually you could commend him for doing that.

270
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:51,660
Speaker 1: if you think that's you know A good way to spend his money would of course actually bill gates spends his money in a much better way.

271
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,598
Speaker 1: You know curing malaria, but uh who needs to give charity to curing malaria?

272
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:55,739
Speaker 1: when

273
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,245
Speaker 0: you know a starving

274
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,595
Speaker 1: indie comic writer in new york, I would

275
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:13,422
Speaker 0: put forth a Relatively substantial amount of money if I could see more firefly Like like if it was a fact that if say ten thousand firefly fans each gave a thousand dollars There'd be another season I might.

276
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:15,590
Speaker 0: it might be worth a thousand dollars to me.

277
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can if you want give to charity.

278
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:19,523
Speaker 1: It is charity.

279
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,971
Speaker 1: Don't fool yourself and there's nothing wrong with that.

280
00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:24,419
Speaker 1: It's perfectly fine if you love something that much.

281
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:36,171
Speaker 1: But the problem I have is when people go around and tell other people that they're bad or they're wrong or they Have an obligation because they like something to also give to charity.

282
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:39,480
Speaker 1: No one is ever obligated to give to charity nobody.

283
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,660
Speaker 1: I mean, it's nice to do so but you can't tell someone they're bad for not doing it.

284
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,300
Speaker 1: I guess you could tell someone they're bad if they stole from charity.

285
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:50,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be bad If you went into like the united way and just walked out with 20 bucks.

286
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,225
Speaker 0: But then I mean like what's the if you?

287
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:54,072
Speaker 0: if someone is saying that what's the line?

288
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:56,420
Speaker 0: you didn't donate five thousand dollars to whatever?

289
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,000
Speaker 0: You didn't give your kidney to some random person you're breathing air.

290
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,465
Speaker 0: Someone else could be using that that that xbox you bought that those plastic I mean, what's the line?

291
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:12,999
Speaker 1: and it's even worse when they're talking about charity to For-profit companies usually, you know companies that are trying to make money.

292
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:19,970
Speaker 1: You know if an anime is failing because it doesn't have good enough marketing That doesn't mean we should buy more dvs.

293
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,940
Speaker 1: It means maybe adv should get better marketing.

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,133
Speaker 1: It means maybe funimation should learn how to sell their dvds.

295
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:26,940
Speaker 1: Maybe bandai visuals should lower their prices.

296
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:29,260
Speaker 1: It's not my fault that they're not making money.

297
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:30,003
Speaker 1: It's their fault.

298
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:34,440
Speaker 1: and don't try to blame me because then i'll yell at you for on a special episode of geek nights.

299
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:38,351
Speaker 0: Now one last thing before we end this and aside from everything else.

300
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,319
Speaker 0: We've said there's one more reason why the argument really doesn't work.

301
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:48,869
Speaker 0: The anime industry in the us as far as anyone can determine Makes jack and shit off of dvd sales.

302
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:57,135
Speaker 0: the primary market is in merchandise Like plushy tachikomas or plushy cactuars, which I spent 40 on.

303
00:20:57,175 --> 00:20:58,057
Speaker 0: Yeah for one.

304
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:04,700
Speaker 1: Well, someone might be making the argument that they would make money off dvds if you guys just buy them dude.

305
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,660
Speaker 0: But no the the all the money is in marketing.

306
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:13,640
Speaker 0: That's why a lot of shows that are really good Don't make a lot of money because a lot of those shows aren't very marketable.

307
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,437
Speaker 0: I mean how much gankotsuo merchandise could is there out there?

308
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:20,210
Speaker 0: Not so much But how much bleach merchandise is there?

309
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,160
Speaker 0: how much full metal alchemist merchandise was there?

310
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,720
Speaker 0: Some shows are more marketable in that arena than others and those shows are the ones that tend to make piles and piles of money.

311
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to talk about where vis's money is coming from or funimation's money is coming from It's from naruto merchandise.

312
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:36,630
Speaker 1: It ain't from naruto dvds.

313
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,134
Speaker 1: Well naruto manga makes money.

314
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:40,200
Speaker 0: Well, plus I mean a show like naruto.

315
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,979
Speaker 0: That's a show that's pretty much designed to be watched on tv.

316
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:44,842
Speaker 0: You're.

317
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:51,300
Speaker 0: no I don't think anyone is reasonably expected to purchase The dvds of a show that goes on that long because you're never going to watch it again.

318
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:54,460
Speaker 0: It's something like it like says I saw it even though that's not out in here.

319
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:07,120
Speaker 0: Imagine a show that goes on for years and years and years or like the simpsons You know 13 14 20 40 seasons as it just keeps going Other than buying like the seasons that you care about because you want to show them again.

320
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:11,416
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone is reasonably expected to purchase the entirety of the simpsons.

321
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:12,360
Speaker 0: You saw it on tv.

322
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:14,099
Speaker 0: You got your enjoyment out of it.

323
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:22,078
Speaker 0: I think you've got better things to do with your life than watch all those episodes again or track down The one episode from season 13 that you missed and buy it.

324
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:28,373
Speaker 1: though I would like to own all the simpsons dvds I would like to own because then I could watch any simpsons episode at any time.

325
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:31,309
Speaker 0: I wanted to but I don't really have A need to.

326
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,922
Speaker 0: you know much of a pain in the ass That would be.

327
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:43,820
Speaker 0: i'd rather have but I would pay a lot of money to have a thing on my computer Where I can search through simpsons episodes scripts by words and find the exact episodes I want and then watch them.

328
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:44,759
Speaker 1: Give it five years.

329
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:46,920
Speaker 0: I would pay a lot of money for that.

330
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,406
Speaker 1: You just sell hard drives at the store.

331
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:58,029
Speaker 0: that if every episode of the simpsons on them and you can search through all the episodes And they're all you know how much I look forward to the day when all this drm bullshit is behind us Where I can buy movies on usb sticks.

332
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:00,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, you just I would just buy movies download.

333
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:04,840
Speaker 1: It'd be kind of like steam where there's a list of every movie i've ever bought and they just click and they play.

334
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,840
Speaker 1: Oh, i'd be willing to pay but I can also download them in a non-drm format.

335
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:14,400
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna pay a dollar a song which is the reason I don't use itunes a dollar a song forget it.

336
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Speaker 0: But even with I mean if there were no drm and it was like five to ten cents a song I would spend thousands of dollars on music.

337
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,042
Speaker 0: There was.

338
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:26,896
Speaker 1: there was a study that said that the sweet spot for music prices online is five cents.

339
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:34,372
Speaker 1: if it was five cents I would just go online and like type in the name of like The doors and click buy everything they've ever done.

340
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,140
Speaker 1: beatles buy everything they've ever done.

341
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,563
Speaker 1: Let's have them.

342
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,047
Speaker 1: buy everything.

343
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:38,820
Speaker 1: even though I own some cds same with anime.

344
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:48,800
Speaker 0: Like if I see a box set of a show that I kind of liked for 40 bucks or less I'll probably just buy it because it's so cheap and if nothing else i'll give it away as a prize on geek nights.

345
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:50,004
Speaker 1: So this is just but.

346
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:57,919
Speaker 0: but if I give a show away as a prize that i've already seen Aren't I hurting the industry because that person didn't buy those dvds?

347
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:09,060
Speaker 1: I think this just proves that if your only customers are rim and scott that yet again You can't blame us for not buying it's their fault for not making the price the correct price determined by capitalism.

348
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:15,390
Speaker 1: I watch so much lower now that netflix is make more money from people like us And that's it.

349
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:15,893
Speaker 0: All right.

350
00:24:16,094 --> 00:24:16,717
Speaker 0: I think we're done.

351
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:20,620
Speaker 0: Yep So once again, this was not a normal episode of geek nights.

352
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,789
Speaker 0: This was in fact a geek night special.

353
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:31,600
Speaker 0: if you're a new listener, and I know there are a lot of you Listen to any episode that does not have the special tag or in is in the special category.

354
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:34,580
Speaker 0: You'll get a much more sense of what our show is about.

355
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:41,025
Speaker 1: It's not just scott ranting and me laughing while he rants and if you don't support geek nights with charitable donations You're a bad person.

356
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:42,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, send us five bucks.

357
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,456
Speaker 0: So we're not doing the show anymore.

358
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:44,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, just kidding.
