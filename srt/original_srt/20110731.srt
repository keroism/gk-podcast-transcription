1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,823
Speaker 1: And it's the Geek Nights Book Club for July 2011.

2
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:13,265
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:13,927
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,432
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:16,899
Speaker 0: Did you say Geek Nights twice?

6
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:17,541
Speaker 1: I did.

7
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:18,405
Speaker 0: You gotta work on that.

8
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:19,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a new show.

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,839
Speaker 0: So like we said- It's not a new show, it's an old show.

10
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,446
Speaker 1: Cut off of Geek Nights.

11
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:28,083
Speaker 1: So the new book, the next book, will be announced right now.

12
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:30,591
Speaker 0: Before we even say what the current book is?

13
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:31,133
Speaker 1: I guess.

14
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:35,105
Speaker 1: This is the book club review of Isaac Asimov's Foundation.

15
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:35,828
Speaker 0: Yup.

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,172
Speaker 1: Chosen by Scott.

17
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:38,960
Speaker 1: Neither one of us had read it.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,032
Speaker 1: Kind of a big glaring hole in our knowledge of science fiction.

19
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:45,103
Speaker 0: Well, it's because we read Hyperion- Hyperion.

20
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:46,488
Speaker 0: Hyperspace.

21
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:47,732
Speaker 0: Was that the last book club?

22
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:48,756
Speaker 1: I believe so.

23
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:49,098
Speaker 0: Yeah.

24
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:55,808
Speaker 0: We read Hyperspace and it was like, you know, he mentioned Foundation a whole bunch and it's an incredibly famous, important sci-fi book.

25
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:56,833
Speaker 0: and I'm like, "Well, we're nerds.

26
00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:57,778
Speaker 0: Geek Nights.

27
00:00:57,818 --> 00:00:59,226
Speaker 0: How could we not have read that

28
00:00:59,266 --> 00:00:59,467
Speaker 0: book?".

29
00:00:59,487 --> 00:00:59,950
Speaker 0: So I'm like, "Well-".

30
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,880
Speaker 1: I believe you were like, "I've actually never read

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,443
Speaker 1: Foundation.".

32
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:05,173
Speaker 1: And I paused and I was like, "Yeah, I haven't

33
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:05,435
Speaker 1: either.".

34
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:08,306
Speaker 0: I read it partly before, but I didn't remember shit.

35
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:10,556
Speaker 0: So I was like, "That's going to be the book club

36
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:10,777
Speaker 0: book.".

37
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:11,240
Speaker 0: So it was.

38
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,753
Speaker 0: And what do we- we'll talk about that in a minute.

39
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,945
Speaker 0: What are we going to do in August of 2011?

40
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,613
Speaker 0: Because now book club is now monthly.

41
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:21,169
Speaker 1: For August of 2011, this is my book chosen, recommended by Emily.

42
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:22,154
Speaker 1: I have not actually read it.

43
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:23,280
Speaker 0: So it's really Emily's choice.

44
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:26,455
Speaker 1: But I will recommend it among many recommendations I've received.

45
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:30,291
Speaker 1: Some of you recommend some stupid ass crap, just so you know.

46
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,586
Speaker 1: But The Ear, The Eye, and The Arm by Nancy Farmer.

47
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:35,248
Speaker 1: Have you ever heard of it?

48
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:35,850
Speaker 0: No.

49
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,327
Speaker 1: It's a science fiction about three detectives named The Ear, The Eye, and The Arm.

50
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,073
Speaker 0: It's sounding more familiar.

51
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:44,060
Speaker 1: Set in Zimbabwe.

52
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,722
Speaker 1: Alrighty.

53
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:45,524
Speaker 1: In the future.

54
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:47,912
Speaker 1: And I don't want to say much more about it.

55
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:48,454
Speaker 0: I'm guessing.

56
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:50,139
Speaker 0: The Eye, he sees the clues.

57
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,026
Speaker 0: The Ear, he does the eavesdropping.

58
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,679
Speaker 0: And The Arm, he muscles people into confessing.

59
00:01:55,779 --> 00:02:07,161
Speaker 1: Well, to quote a review of it, with its blend of high-tech futurism and authentic African tribal folklore, Nancy Farmer's Newbery Honor book is an exciting selection for recorded fiction.

60
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:09,511
Speaker 0: Isn't the Newbery Medal for kids books?

61
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:11,358
Speaker 1: It is a young adult book.

62
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:11,940
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

63
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,667
Speaker 1: But it's also apparently good.

64
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:15,473
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's bad, but you know.

65
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:21,435
Speaker 1: I mean, I think what sold me on it was that how much African-styled science fiction do we get?

66
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:24,588
Speaker 1: that is well known to fans of science fiction?

67
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:25,351
Speaker 0: I've never heard of any.

68
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:26,336
Speaker 1: Exactly.

69
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:29,029
Speaker 1: So I want to try something that has a unique take on everything.

70
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,991
Speaker 1: Like it kind of takes everything from an angle that we might not be as science fiction readers used to.

71
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,099
Speaker 1: It also came very highly recommended.

72
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:36,702
Speaker 0: Okay.

73
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:41,116
Speaker 1: So we have read Isaac Asimov's Foundation, and you all have read it too.

74
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:43,024
Speaker 0: Only the first one.

75
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:50,134
Speaker 0: It seems like there's the trilogy, which is like foundation, second foundation, and then I don't know what the third one's called, but it's foundation something.

76
00:02:50,595 --> 00:03:00,333
Speaker 0: But then there's even more foundations after that that are like, you know, but I think the three books are the like the core ones, but we only read the first one.

77
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:11,074
Speaker 1: The important thing to remember here is that you have read foundation because if you have not, you should read foundation first because we're going to talk about foundation assuming you have read it.

78
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:11,556
Speaker 0: Yeah.

79
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:12,741
Speaker 1: That's how book clubs work.

80
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:15,995
Speaker 1: If you want to be in the club, you got to read the book.

81
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:17,421
Speaker 0: Read a book.

82
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:20,213
Speaker 0: Maybe we should make that the theme song for this for this show.

83
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:24,186
Speaker 1: That would be some fair use possibly until we get sued.

84
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:24,668
Speaker 0: Maybe.

85
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,734
Speaker 0: Anyway, so foundation.

86
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:30,390
Speaker 0: So I really didn't know much about foundation cause I completely forgot.

87
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,617
Speaker 1: I knew the gist of it.

88
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:36,190
Speaker 0: I knew it was sci-fi and it was about some galactic civilization.

89
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,337
Speaker 1: I knew that it was laying a foundation.

90
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:42,957
Speaker 1: No, that it was like, seriously, I knew it was about galactic civilization.

91
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:51,070
Speaker 1: I knew it was sci-fi laying some sort of foundation for a future civilization, like some sort of like making a vault, like a library of Alexandria.

92
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,838
Speaker 1: That is all I knew about this book.

93
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:53,944
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't even know that.

94
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:05,362
Speaker 0: But anyway, so what it really is, is it's like, it's all, it's a collection of short stories and I think where they actually published as all these separate short stories in like a periodical and then later collected into the novels.

95
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,567
Speaker 1: No, I don't know actually.

96
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not a hundred percent sure.

97
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:10,968
Speaker 0: I didn't research it very well, but I just read the book.

98
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:11,852
Speaker 0: I didn't research it.

99
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:12,977
Speaker 0: Um, we are best.

100
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:13,901
Speaker 0: Yes, we are best.

101
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:20,367
Speaker 0: But basically what it is, this story, there was a galactic empire, a huge galaxy spanning empire.

102
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:21,873
Speaker 1: Well, when the book starts, there still is.

103
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:22,636
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

104
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:23,118
Speaker 0: There was.

105
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:27,034
Speaker 0: And this was like the great galactic empire, basically Rome.

106
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:29,964
Speaker 0: In fact, it is Rome, right?

107
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:32,994
Speaker 0: It owns almost- It's pretty obviously allegory to Rome.

108
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:39,236
Speaker 1: The things that happen and the way this thing falls apart are basically why and how Rome fell apart.

109
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it falls apart like Rome.

110
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:44,900
Speaker 1: You know, I thought we were assuming that people have already read the book.

111
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:45,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, I am.

112
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:46,791
Speaker 1: So you're explaining it.

113
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:47,794
Speaker 0: Yeah.

114
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,255
Speaker 0: Yeah.

115
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:49,378
Speaker 1: All right.

116
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:54,114
Speaker 0: Just, you know, because- You can keep explaining the book that you all just read.

117
00:04:54,154 --> 00:05:01,188
Speaker 0: If you went to a book club at, you know, a bookstore, you would still, you know, quickly cursorily go over the, you know, the plot.

118
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,057
Speaker 1: I don't know if you were or if they just be like, so what did you think?

119
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:04,605
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe.

120
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,048
Speaker 0: I don't know.

121
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,404
Speaker 0: But then I feel like I also want to extend the episode at the same time.

122
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:10,492
Speaker 0: And also, you know, someone's listening who didn't read.

123
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:11,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, fuck you.

124
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:19,720
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the galactic civilization falls apart, but this is incredibly far in the future, right?

125
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:23,253
Speaker 0: You know, you can travel faster than light and all this stuff.

126
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:30,019
Speaker 0: So one guy is really smart and he can actually use math and psychology to predict the future of civilization.

127
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,306
Speaker 1: It's not that he's really smart.

128
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:36,046
Speaker 1: It's that he has this field of study that itself- He's also really smart.

129
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:40,545
Speaker 1: Anyone who understands the field of study can, you know, basically tell us a civilization.

130
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:41,027
Speaker 1: Yeah.

131
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:42,354
Speaker 1: They can't do it to a person.

132
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:42,978
Speaker 0: Statistically.

133
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:45,673
Speaker 0: You can't get the details right, but he can get the big picture right.

134
00:05:45,994 --> 00:05:52,563
Speaker 1: So what do you do if, you know, you figure out that your entire world, as you know it, is going to collapse in a foreseeable span of time?

135
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,070
Speaker 0: He knows a dark age is coming.

136
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,701
Speaker 0: So what he does- But never mind, it's the rocket fuel equation.

137
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:01,941
Speaker 1: So doing something about it alters what's going to happen.

138
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:02,383
Speaker 0: Right.

139
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:04,410
Speaker 0: So he pretty much does everything he can.

140
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,512
Speaker 0: He figures out that he can't avoid the dark age, but he figures out a way to shorten the dark age.

141
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:22,343
Speaker 0: And as you read all these short stories that each take place a few decades after each other with different characters, you know, throughout this, you know, as the history unfolds, it's like it's a history, but it's not.

142
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:23,066
Speaker 0: It's the future.

143
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:26,660
Speaker 0: It's the present is unfolding before your eyes.

144
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:31,040
Speaker 0: After this guy comes up with his plan, you get to see his plan and you don't know what the plan is.

145
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,918
Speaker 0: You just get to see it happen and you can sort of predict what it's going to be.

146
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,112
Speaker 0: But, you know, there are some surprises here and there.

147
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:38,754
Speaker 0: Right.

148
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:43,335
Speaker 1: So I will just put forth on the record, I don't think we need to bother explaining the plot.

149
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,998
Speaker 0: All right, fine.

150
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,110
Speaker 1: We'll see what the listener has to say about that.

151
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,451
Speaker 0: Sure.

152
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,097
Speaker 0: We're done explaining the plot.

153
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:49,803
Speaker 0: So what did you think?

154
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:54,643
Speaker 1: I was pleasantly surprised, just as I always am when I read classic sci fi I have not read before.

155
00:06:55,085 --> 00:07:05,178
Speaker 1: Every time I decide to read a classic sci fi that I have not already read, I expect it to be very overwrought and very like stilted.

156
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,250
Speaker 1: And it is never the case that that is what I actually end up reading.

157
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:11,279
Speaker 1: It flowed very much like a real book.

158
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it was good.

159
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:13,487
Speaker 1: It was enjoyable.

160
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,400
Speaker 1: I'm going to keep reading until I hear it gets really bad later.

161
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:16,922
Speaker 0: Really?

162
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:19,754
Speaker 1: I heard once the beast appears.

163
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:20,296
Speaker 1: It sucks.

164
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:22,084
Speaker 1: Like it's just not worth reading beyond that point.

165
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:22,465
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

166
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:22,807
Speaker 0: Okay.

167
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:26,522
Speaker 0: I expected it to be awesome, but I actually started reading.

168
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,814
Speaker 0: I didn't feel awesome until I got a few pages in that it felt awesome.

169
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:34,653
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that Asimov in this book does something very particular.

170
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:39,976
Speaker 1: Every age, because you know, it's split into ages, like the psycho historians, the encyclopedists, the mayors.

171
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:40,739
Speaker 0: Right, right.

172
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,075
Speaker 1: That there's always one guy or a small group of people who know what's up.

173
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:45,437
Speaker 1: Exactly.

174
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:46,763
Speaker 1: They have a shit eating grin.

175
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:52,248
Speaker 1: You can see it in your mind's eye whole time you're reading the shittest eating his grin a human has ever had.

176
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,595
Speaker 0: It's like the torchbearer, right?

177
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:56,330
Speaker 0: It's like Harry Seldon lit this torch and he passed it on through the ears.

178
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,977
Speaker 0: And there's always one guy carrying it.

179
00:07:57,998 --> 00:07:59,465
Speaker 0: And you know who that guy is immediately.

180
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:04,570
Speaker 1: And even if like it wasn't obvious from the story, it's the one guy where you don't know what he's thinking.

181
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,332
Speaker 0: Always a guy.

182
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:07,540
Speaker 1: Are there any girls in this?

183
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,322
Speaker 1: Not yet.

184
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,606
Speaker 1: There's that one courtesan.

185
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:10,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

186
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,030
Speaker 1: Yep.

187
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:15,448
Speaker 1: And she, well, they, uh, they foist off some jewelry on her and she's done.

188
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:15,809
Speaker 1: Yeah.

189
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,056
Speaker 0: Good job as a mom.

190
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,140
Speaker 1: Way to progress.

191
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,243
Speaker 1: women's science fiction.

192
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:20,925
Speaker 1: Yeah.

193
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,277
Speaker 0: I'm sure, you know, I guess it's all, I guess it is shortly after Rome.

194
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:25,381
Speaker 0: So women don't have rights.

195
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:25,862
Speaker 0: I don't know.

196
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:26,826
Speaker 1: Yeah.

197
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:32,869
Speaker 1: But, uh, I said he has this shit eating grin character in every age and every other character.

198
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,717
Speaker 1: Like, you know what they're trying to accomplish.

199
00:08:34,738 --> 00:08:35,823
Speaker 1: You get inside their heads.

200
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:40,238
Speaker 1: The main character always just like the other guy will say, Oh, this is why your plan will fail.

201
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:46,854
Speaker 1: Or you don't even have a well see.

202
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:50,428
Speaker 0: And the thing is like, you're always rooting for the guy who knows what's up.

203
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:50,931
Speaker 0: Of course.

204
00:08:50,951 --> 00:09:04,362
Speaker 0: Because the guy, and you know, he's always going to win because he's always kind of a jerk because you just like, you begin to believe right after that first chapter where, or the first age where Seldon appears for the first crisis.

205
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:05,466
Speaker 0: And it was like, you were right.

206
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:05,968
Speaker 1: Yep.

207
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:08,902
Speaker 0: From that, you just become a believer in it, right?

208
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:16,318
Speaker 0: It's like, even though, you know, in the book, there's like the fake religion they invent to get people to believe in Seldon, which reminded me very much of last exile.

209
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:16,840
Speaker 0: Yeah.

210
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,372
Speaker 0: Like it's almost the exact same thing almost, but it's like, now you act, the reader believe in Harry Seldon that, you know, he's almost like this godlike figure.

211
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:25,798
Speaker 0: His plan is for real,

212
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:40,796
Speaker 1: which is interesting because that's part of the reason why I think I identify so much with the like salver harden in the encyclopedist, the people who are the smart ones with the shit eating grins, because you having seen how everything played out from this objective standpoint as the reader,

213
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:41,901
Speaker 0: you

214
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:44,532
Speaker 1: believe it and you know that that guy is going to win.

215
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:47,830
Speaker 1: So when he smiles and nods, you're smiling and nodding right along with him.

216
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:52,269
Speaker 0: I do think it's in the first book, at least they didn't, your belief wasn't, uh, challenged.

217
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,125
Speaker 0: I wonder if in the future books, your belief will be challenged, right?

218
00:09:55,166 --> 00:10:01,770
Speaker 0: Because it was like, they talk about, ah, Seldon had 95% certainty on this, but all his methods were statistical.

219
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:11,762
Speaker 0: We know that as we get further out, his, you know, the power of his plan will decrease and statistically, it's more likely that something will go wrong.

220
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:12,263
Speaker 1: Yep.

221
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:14,693
Speaker 0: But I kind of want to see that happen.

222
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:17,729
Speaker 0: And then I want to see it go wrong and then go right again.

223
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:22,821
Speaker 1: The errors of this book kind of follow errors of human history.

224
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:27,073
Speaker 1: We control the population with just religion.

225
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:31,547
Speaker 1: Well, well first commerce first it's government and busy work.

226
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:32,008
Speaker 0: Yeah.

227
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:33,072
Speaker 1: Then it's religion.

228
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:34,457
Speaker 1: Then it's commerce.

229
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:35,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

230
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:42,535
Speaker 0: Actually in between there's, there's, there's the nice progression, but it's, it's sort of like, they don't say it, but it's so obvious that it's like, how do we get through a dark age?

231
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:54,638
Speaker 0: We'll just force the progression of human history that already happened one step at a time as quickly as possible to get people, the whole society built back up to be, you know, modern again.

232
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:56,665
Speaker 0: But you know, it's sort of like.

233
00:10:56,685 --> 00:11:00,621
Speaker 0: he's saying at first he says he wants the encyclopedia, but that's just the cover story.

234
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:09,504
Speaker 0: Then he says the goal of the plan is to bring back the empire, but it's like, when you really think about it, it's like, no, the goal of the plan isn't to bring back the empire, right?

235
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,697
Speaker 0: Even though it hasn't happened because we're only in the first book.

236
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:14,111
Speaker 1: The empire would fail again for the same reason, right?

237
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,556
Speaker 0: The empire is a monarchy.

238
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:27,204
Speaker 0: The goal is to bring back a galactic civilization that is not a monarchy or an emperor or anything, but is, you know, a democratic, you know, amazing, maybe democratic, maybe not, but you know, something awesome.

239
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:28,150
Speaker 0: That's not an emperor.

240
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:28,872
Speaker 0: Yeah.

241
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:30,016
Speaker 0: That's the general idea.

242
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:33,889
Speaker 1: I did like the emperor because he wasn't that bad.

243
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,017
Speaker 0: Well, he was, he wasn't like Nicholas the second.

244
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:38,467
Speaker 1: He was just, I don't know.

245
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:52,577
Speaker 1: He had a fun, like the way he was described in the, the level of disparity between the nobles and the ruling classes and the rest of the people in the empire was pretty like, I also like how the empire still exists, right?

246
00:11:52,657 --> 00:12:03,181
Speaker 0: It's like, that was great at the end of the, you know, it's like, you didn't really think about it, but then once, you know, at the, towards the end, you learn the empire still exists and it's like, Oh, well obviously it would, you know, it's like, it didn't

247
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:03,743
Speaker 1: get until the 1400s,

248
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,039
Speaker 0: didn't get destroyed completely.

249
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,647
Speaker 0: It was spread across so many worlds.

250
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,172
Speaker 0: It was like a raid, a billion, right?

251
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:12,497
Speaker 0: You couldn't take the whole thing out.

252
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:13,079
Speaker 0: It just weakened.

253
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:20,530
Speaker 0: So it lost its hold over outer territories and it was no longer a galaxy spanning ultra strong civilization.

254
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:23,543
Speaker 0: It just lost so much influence, but it still existed.

255
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:27,043
Speaker 0: You know, the capital planet was still, you know, it's like no one attacked it and conquered it.

256
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:39,336
Speaker 1: But I really like, like when the traders are trying to figure out, well, the one traders trying to figure out what's going on with the planet that somehow has nucleix and he sees the Imperial insignia on the guns, he's like, Oh shit.

257
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:52,221
Speaker 0: That's another thing is that it, there's a lot of nerd sort of fantasy fulfillment things that are happening for, you know, like what if I went to a primitive place with my advanced technologies, that would be so awesome.

258
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:53,124
Speaker 0: Right?

259
00:12:53,184 --> 00:13:03,600
Speaker 0: So it's like, well, what happens if, you know, one sort of planet splits off and maintains the high level of knowledge and the other places in the world descend into a dark age.

260
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:10,988
Speaker 1: I mean, I love this feeling that one trader ship could probably wipe out the majority of the space navies in the known universe.

261
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,470
Speaker 0: Yeah.

262
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:17,198
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you like to always talk about how people in the dark ages saw shit that was leftover from the previous age.

263
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:18,966
Speaker 1: Precursor technology just gets me going.

264
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:21,316
Speaker 0: And we're like, how the fuck was this made?

265
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:21,457
Speaker 0: Right?

266
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:22,602
Speaker 0: Well, think of La Calama, right?

267
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:23,748
Speaker 0: There's the elder glass.

268
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:26,280
Speaker 0: Well, imagine, you know, it's one thing for their.

269
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,657
Speaker 0: it's like, Oh, in the past they knew how to make elder glass and no one knows how to make it anymore.

270
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:33,977
Speaker 0: Well, what if there was another place in the same time where they still knew how to make?

271
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:35,805
Speaker 0: it is just not in your place.

272
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:36,568
Speaker 0: So that's what it's like.

273
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:40,084
Speaker 0: And then suddenly one day people who know how to make elder glass show up.

274
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:41,811
Speaker 0: It's like, Oh, that's so awesome.

275
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,199
Speaker 1: They're like, what are you doing with our shit?

276
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,566
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's good stuff.

277
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,515
Speaker 0: It just makes, it's a lot of stuff to make nerds happy.

278
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:57,698
Speaker 1: The smart jerk that everyone is mad at and opposing wins epically every time.

279
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,910
Speaker 0: And people always, they always seem to be able to avoid military force.

280
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,174
Speaker 0: usually, right?

281
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:04,901
Speaker 0: Because what's the phrase in the book?

282
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:09,320
Speaker 1: It's like violence is the last resort of a week, like weak minds or something.

283
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:09,963
Speaker 1: I forget the quote.

284
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:10,366
Speaker 0: Yeah.

285
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:15,492
Speaker 0: And it's like the, you know, they're so smart that they can always avoid war and they don't avoid war with like a Gandhi strategy.

286
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:26,232
Speaker 0: They avoid war with like a clever plan strategy and you get the same sort of thing going on as you do with like sanctuary where like they find some clever way out of it to stay in the game.

287
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:29,305
Speaker 0: I think the biggest, but it's like, it's so Epic though.

288
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:36,111
Speaker 0: Cause in sanctuary, it's like two guys find a way to stay in the game and this, an entire civilization finds a way to stay in the game.

289
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:45,444
Speaker 1: But I like how the way they stay in the game is not the sort of like proper way you'd expect with some like very intricate and good guy way of doing it.

290
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:48,275
Speaker 1: And they, they just fucking like lie to people get like that.

291
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:51,710
Speaker 1: Remember they give the guy the transmuter that's going to just stop working.

292
00:14:52,231 --> 00:14:52,431
Speaker 0: Yeah.

293
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:55,022
Speaker 1: They just, they do like the pirate way.

294
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,030
Speaker 1: It's almost the Harlock way of saving the day.

295
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:06,129
Speaker 0: The other thing about it that's pretty interesting is the whole thing about, you know, uh, Seldon is psychologist and they don't let any psychologist survive.

296
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:09,139
Speaker 0: So they purposefully make that knowledge lost.

297
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:16,911
Speaker 1: So it's like, it's like, it eliminates the rocket fuel equation where the amount of fuel you need in a rocket depends upon how much fuel you have in the rocket.

298
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:17,554
Speaker 0: Yeah.

299
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:18,820
Speaker 1: Just with psycho history.

300
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:30,730
Speaker 1: I mean, if someone knew like, what if, you know, the Prince of nothing, what if it's kept like someone like Nair who kind of knows tell us his game can cock everything up because he can affect it in ways much greater than people who don't know.

301
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,824
Speaker 0: So it's like they, they using a particular technology, right.

302
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:37,013
Speaker 0: To get to, to achieve a certain goal.

303
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:45,069
Speaker 0: But if someone understands that technology, if they under, they have the gnosis or whatever, they can see right through it and begin to work it the same way they worked it.

304
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:54,302
Speaker 0: Because they want their stuff to be able to their plan to work for centuries and set for thousands of years, it's going to take, I think he said a thousand years, right?

305
00:15:54,764 --> 00:16:00,165
Speaker 0: That he needs there not to be anyone to do with his knowledge that could cock it up.

306
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:02,553
Speaker 0: So that way, basically he's, it's like building a robot.

307
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:06,629
Speaker 0: That's like Astro boy, but nobody knows how to make an Astro boy.

308
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,880
Speaker 0: Cause it's like, you know, you send an Astro boy into the past.

309
00:16:09,162 --> 00:16:14,945
Speaker 0: And as long as there's no roboticists in the past, then nobody can do anything to Astro boy.

310
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:16,952
Speaker 0: So he's basically omnipotent because he's in the past.

311
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:24,687
Speaker 0: So that's basically eliminate all psychological knowledge, but at the same time in this sort of society, psychological power is unassailable for that.

312
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,071
Speaker 0: I have a moral question for you.

313
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:36,525
Speaker 1: If you are the mayor, let's say of terminus and a group of people start working diligently to rediscover psycho history and figure it all out.

314
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:37,329
Speaker 1: Do you stop them?

315
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:47,421
Speaker 0: Well, if they succeed, then that means that the original psycho history of Seldon either a intended that or B failed, which you can't do anything about.

316
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:51,655
Speaker 1: or maybe C by that logic, you can say that about anything.

317
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:57,582
Speaker 1: that if anything happens, either it was right or it was wrong and things would have progressed the way they progressed anyway.

318
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:58,909
Speaker 1: So why even bother?

319
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:04,512
Speaker 0: But the only, there is a way though, to tell if Seldon, if it's going the right way opens, right?

320
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:06,800
Speaker 0: When the crisis happens, that is a good way to tell.

321
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:22,154
Speaker 0: Another great way to tell is if things are generally trending away from a dark age, if something causes a trend towards a dark age, you know, to less intelligence, less intellect, then you know that it's going the wrong way and it's not working.

322
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:33,750
Speaker 0: every time, every step, every time there's a crisis, things trend up trending away from the dark age and towards Renaissance and enlightenment seem to have figured out early on.

323
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:46,977
Speaker 1: internal and external crisis were designed to coincide like that because I think that's really what he's after Harry Seldon in the end that you, if the galactic empire reforms or anything like it, then it would stagnate again.

324
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:50,150
Speaker 1: And if it was just the encyclopedist again, it would stagnate.

325
00:17:50,632 --> 00:18:02,313
Speaker 1: the external crisis forces the rest of the world to be dealt with, to eventually, you know, spread the knowledge and overcome the internal crisis forces everything to constantly be changing up inside.

326
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:03,478
Speaker 1: so we can never stagnate.

327
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:06,050
Speaker 1: Like both are necessary or it wouldn't work.

328
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:06,990
Speaker 0: Yeah.

329
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:09,586
Speaker 0: They had to, they had to both evolve themselves.

330
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:12,143
Speaker 0: They can't, they, you know, they couldn't just stay in encyclopedia mode forever.

331
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:13,150
Speaker 0: That wouldn't have worked, right?

332
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,522
Speaker 1: That's like a bacteria that cysts and never un-cysts.

333
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:17,010
Speaker 1: It's not a bacteria anymore.

334
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:17,491
Speaker 1: And

335
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:39,190
Speaker 0: it needs to spread and it also, you know, so it's like he's basically forced it into this evolutionary pattern, you know, where the society acts in a Darwinian as a whole, you know, not within society, but as a whole, the society is like an organism that is evolving, but not using Darwinian, you know, uh, you know, like, uh, you know, to like, let's kill all the weak people.

336
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,873
Speaker 0: They don't do that.

337
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:45,617
Speaker 1: I really enjoyed when they first, like the vault opens the first time and they go inside, you know, the few people.

338
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:46,602
Speaker 0: Yeah.

339
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:53,310
Speaker 1: And the fact that they look around and they see way more chairs than there are them and they wonder if they already did something wrong.

340
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:54,233
Speaker 0: All right.

341
00:18:55,258 --> 00:19:04,570
Speaker 1: I also, I think my favorite moment when I really have to consider it is when they use religion to punk wenis, wenis, the prince on, on a Korean.

342
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:06,276
Speaker 1: I love all that.

343
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:08,470
Speaker 0: Like that prince is like, I'll do whatever I want.

344
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,421
Speaker 0: Where they get like the glowing clothes and shit.

345
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:16,990
Speaker 1: And then he just like turns off his glowing cloak and turns off his throne and turns off all the nuclear power.

346
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:17,672
Speaker 0: Yeah.

347
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:30,766
Speaker 0: It's the, it's, you know, it's the old significantly advanced technologies into, you know, into, uh, inseparable from magic and it's like, well, yeah, but here's the thing is it's not inseparable from magic because they understand the technology.

348
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:37,135
Speaker 0: The other guy doesn't say the guy thinks it's magic, but you know, it's not, I know it's sort of like, it's almost like a superhero power fantasy.

349
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:46,150
Speaker 0: It's like you have a planet of super powered nerds that are superheroes because they have advanced technology and all the moron planets are basically bad guys.

350
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:55,390
Speaker 1: My worry is that foundation is fun and good, but I don't think it's necessarily provocative as science fiction.

351
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,602
Speaker 0: Well, maybe it was in its day, right?

352
00:19:57,622 --> 00:19:59,050
Speaker 0: This is like seventies, right?

353
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:10,122
Speaker 1: I mean more in terms of, if you look at it, the, the fundamental answer to like the question is asking is how do you like prevent dark ages going forward?

354
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,070
Speaker 1: Like what can you do if crisis is coming?

355
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,589
Speaker 0: Too bad psycho history isn't real.

356
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:15,735
Speaker 1: Well, maybe it is.

357
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:29,369
Speaker 1: I mean, sociology, we can pretty accurately predict how mobs of people will act in certain situations, but we don't, we can't do that yet, but that set, you know, some many years in the future, like 10,000 years beyond where we are now.

358
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:42,455
Speaker 0: But there's still, I think is, that's another thing I noticed about the book I want to comment on is how many, you know, it's, it's supposed to be the future, but how much of it is still so eighties and seventies, right?

359
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:49,844
Speaker 0: Cause it's like the talking about nucleix, like nuclear power is the shit and it's like, yeah, no, but look at what nucleix are portrayed as.

360
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:52,233
Speaker 1: they're not reactors the way we know them.

361
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,832
Speaker 1: They're more like the kind of nanotechnological manipulation in our science fiction.

362
00:20:56,852 --> 00:21:04,184
Speaker 1: The point is when, you know, a lot of this stuff and I think they're called nucleix because that's, it sounds like it puts it on a parallel path.

363
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:07,580
Speaker 1: It's not like nuclear power as they knew in the eighties, seventies, sixties, fifties.

364
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:08,385
Speaker 0: Yeah.

365
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:11,637
Speaker 0: But it, you know, the point, it's still a lot of this stuff.

366
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:15,850
Speaker 1: If it sounds eighties to you, that means Asimov was a genius.

367
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:18,156
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it was published in 1951.

368
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:18,798
Speaker 1: What?

369
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,741
Speaker 1: Okay.

370
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:22,690
Speaker 0: Well, they had nuclear power in 51.

371
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,817
Speaker 0: I guess I had the year, I had the year completely wrong.

372
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:32,528
Speaker 0: But the point is, is that a lot of this stuff you could tell was like a sign of, you know, the times it was written.

373
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:37,611
Speaker 0: Like some of the technologies were advanced and some of the technologies were the same as when the book was written.

374
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:38,353
Speaker 1: What was the same?

375
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,425
Speaker 1: The screens were all like flat screens.

376
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,814
Speaker 0: I didn't even see them talking about screens.

377
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:47,530
Speaker 0: There were, there were screens, but it's like, you know, they still had books.

378
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:49,236
Speaker 0: They didn't have internet.

379
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:56,929
Speaker 0: We still have books, you know, they would still use, you know, it's, it's, we have books now, but we wouldn't have books thousands of years from now.

380
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,477
Speaker 0: Books are starting to go away already.

381
00:21:58,638 --> 00:22:01,352
Speaker 1: Maybe they kept books because, you know, the, everything was collapsing.

382
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:02,779
Speaker 0: That happens with a lot of sci-fis.

383
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,517
Speaker 0: Like you always think of some things to advance and some things don't.

384
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:13,988
Speaker 1: Well, like look at, we just watched Total Recall not that long ago and how everyone has gigantic walkie talkies and there's gigantic CRTs everywhere.

385
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:14,369
Speaker 0: Yeah.

386
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,364
Speaker 0: But except for the, in his house, there's like the great flat screen.

387
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:21,404
Speaker 1: And the fact that they're always like, it's weird how they're always using video phones.

388
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:24,114
Speaker 1: Something that to this day isn't anything that anyone wants.

389
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,139
Speaker 0: We have FaceTime, but no one wants it.

390
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:45,938
Speaker 1: But you know, I guess, I guess my point when I say it's not that provocative is, you know, it's a great, and it brings forth a lot of interesting ideas, but the core ideas, the way they resolve their problems are really just a superhero fixes everything every time.

391
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,021
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's true.

392
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:49,569
Speaker 1: One awesome nerd saves the day.

393
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:52,721
Speaker 0: But it's not so much about the fact that an awesome nerd saves the day.

394
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:55,271
Speaker 0: It's what does the nerd do to save the day?

395
00:22:55,532 --> 00:22:57,279
Speaker 0: Cause he doesn't do anything magical.

396
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:58,665
Speaker 0: It is technology, right?

397
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:00,493
Speaker 0: And it's always like, what is he going to do?

398
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:01,880
Speaker 0: And sometimes you know what he's going to do.

399
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:08,729
Speaker 0: You know, as soon as it's about traitors that he's going to switch from religion to, you know, uh, mercantilism, right?

400
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:10,115
Speaker 0: You just know that's, what's going to happen.

401
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:19,960
Speaker 0: But in like the, the earlier ones, he didn't know a hundred percent what he was going to do, you know, when he's like going to be married, he's going out, you know, it's like, I guess it's just that.

402
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,734
Speaker 1: the, the problems that are present, like the fundamental question is interesting.

403
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:35,750
Speaker 1: The individual problems presented are more interesting from an illumination of our current problems than they are as a future looking like, how do we change things perspective?

404
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:46,286
Speaker 1: They're more like, if you read this from the perspective of understanding where religion and where everything we had up to this point came from, it's very provocative.

405
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:48,975
Speaker 1: If you read it future looking, not so much.

406
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:50,801
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

407
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:51,102
Speaker 0: Still.

408
00:23:51,202 --> 00:23:51,825
Speaker 0: It's fun.

409
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:52,627
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

410
00:23:52,667 --> 00:24:01,791
Speaker 0: You can tell, I guess if it was for the fifties, a lot of the, you know, it's like, it's almost like we've heard this story so many times before, but it's like, well, maybe this was the one of the earliest instances of this story.

411
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:02,574
Speaker 1: Right.

412
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:06,890
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, you realize 1951 was when the book compiling all of them was published.

413
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,154
Speaker 0: Ah, so it was short stories.

414
00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:09,835
Speaker 0: Yeah.

415
00:24:10,036 --> 00:24:12,421
Speaker 0: So, man, that's real old.

416
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:12,942
Speaker 0: Yeah.

417
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:13,523
Speaker 0: Old.

418
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:18,597
Speaker 0: Um, yeah, I definitely, I'm going to read the, uh, the rest of them.

419
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:23,704
Speaker 0: At least I've got the next two to make the trilogy and I'll see if I go beyond that, you know, cause I don't know what this is.

420
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:26,517
Speaker 1: I'll read up until the beast and then I'll make my decision from there.

421
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:27,441
Speaker 0: The beast.

422
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:29,430
Speaker 1: Watch the beast is just like a woman.

423
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:32,613
Speaker 0: Oh God.

424
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:36,770
Speaker 0: We got, we definitely, the book definitely has negative points for the no women situation.

425
00:24:37,652 --> 00:24:38,555
Speaker 0: Yeah.

426
00:24:39,218 --> 00:24:40,061
Speaker 0: It's like, really?

427
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,470
Speaker 0: The galactic empire is only a man.

428
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:45,737
Speaker 1: So we're curious, what are your thoughts?

429
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,892
Speaker 1: I mean, this is a book club, so this was just our short take.

430
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:55,364
Speaker 0: I think now that the book club is its own show that doesn't have news, maybe we should, you know, take some comments on the future books.

431
00:24:55,385 --> 00:24:57,152
Speaker 0: So what's your, what's the book again, rim?

432
00:24:57,172 --> 00:24:58,719
Speaker 0: I, the eye, the ear and the arm.

433
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,004
Speaker 1: This is one of those titles.

434
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:04,121
Speaker 1: That's a lot like nine somethings, nine somethings, nine somethings.

435
00:25:04,362 --> 00:25:05,847
Speaker 0: You forget the, forget the order.

436
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:07,935
Speaker 1: It's the ear, the eye and the arm.

437
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:08,418
Speaker 0: All right.

438
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:16,172
Speaker 0: So if you read the ear, the eye and the arm, send in your comments to eat nights at front row crew.com or post them in the forum or post them in the forum.

439
00:25:16,273 --> 00:25:20,593
Speaker 0: And then we will, you may perhaps read some on the next book club episode, which would be in a month.

440
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:21,035
Speaker 0: Yes.

441
00:25:21,377 --> 00:25:21,759
Speaker 0: One month.

442
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,614
Speaker 0: We're going to do it towards the end of every month as its own episode.

443
00:25:24,634 --> 00:25:26,666
Speaker 0: It won't be a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.

444
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:27,330
Speaker 0: It'd be its own thing.

445
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,242
Speaker 1: But for foundation, I still want to hear your thoughts.

446
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:30,892
Speaker 1: I want to hear if you enjoyed it as much as we did.

447
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:32,741
Speaker 0: We won't talk about it on the show though.

448
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:45,738
Speaker 1: If you agree with our assessments of it and all that, if you have any interesting insights, we obviously skipped over a kind of textbook analysis of it because that's, you can read articles if you want to get like some professor talking about their thoughts.

449
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:49,217
Speaker 1: I just want to talk about our personal, like, what I got out of this.

450
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,638
Speaker 0: It's like I could have researched the book and talked more about that, but it's like, you can read Wikipedia too.

451
00:25:53,658 --> 00:25:57,074
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, we're not the only ones who know how to read Wikipedia.

452
00:25:57,415 --> 00:26:04,364
Speaker 1: I doubt many books we review in the book club will have startling insights from rim and Scott hitherto unknown to the world.

453
00:26:04,525 --> 00:26:04,806
Speaker 0: Yeah.

454
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:12,819
Speaker 0: It's like I kind of, you know, most of the reason for the book club is just to get you to read, you know, and the show is just sort of like, you know, entertainment to encourage.

455
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,497
Speaker 0: It's like, here is an entertainment that you can enjoy more if you read the book.

456
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:18,727
Speaker 0: So that's encouraging you to read the book.

457
00:26:18,747 --> 00:26:20,571
Speaker 0: You know, everything else is just icing.

458
00:26:26,957 --> 00:26:29,520
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

459
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,175
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and brand.

460
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:33,536
Speaker 1: Okay.

461
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:39,658
Speaker 0: For the logos, be sure to visit our website@frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

462
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,571
Speaker 1: Remember geek nights is not one, but four different shows.

463
00:26:42,712 --> 00:26:47,352
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.
