1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,028
Speaker 1: It's Thursday June 21st.

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,011
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:16,680
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:30,082
Speaker 0: spoilers Let's do this Man today.

5
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:36,220
Speaker 1: I was looking at the Dell website a new egg, and I'm getting real close to just buying a gigantic monitor.

6
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:38,205
Speaker 0: Yeah, you kind of need one.

7
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:40,051
Speaker 0: you had that shitty 19-inch CRT is great.

8
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:40,653
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sucks.

9
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:40,894
Speaker 1: It's fine.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,707
Speaker 0: And yeah many years.

11
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:49,800
Speaker 1: the only reason I'm really getting rid of it is that I can't have it and my microphone.

12
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:51,646
Speaker 0: It still sucks.

13
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:55,205
Speaker 0: It's fine, and oh if it's so fine Why aren't you using it right now?

14
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:57,860
Speaker 1: like I just said I can't have it and my microphone.

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,746
Speaker 0: Yeah, it in your microphone for a long time before yeah And you know what it totally sucked.

16
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:05,623
Speaker 1: cuz I had to keep the microphone like several feet away from it or else I got that honey.

17
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:08,617
Speaker 0: Well that crappy crappy crappy LCD using right now.

18
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:11,488
Speaker 1: Oh god This thing is is not the business.

19
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:14,699
Speaker 0: It's still better than that 19-inch CRT that you not really.

20
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,868
Speaker 1: yeah I really I'd prefer the CRT right now.

21
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, your eyes are broken.

22
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:19,057
Speaker 0: What do you know?

23
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:19,740
Speaker 1: well plus once?

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,760
Speaker 1: I realized that according to the stress test I can get a couple thousand frames per second in half-life 2 with everything turned up.

25
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:31,134
Speaker 1: so uh I Think I'm gonna go with the gigantic high-resolution widescreen monitor.

26
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:41,860
Speaker 0: the thing that I've noticed though Especially with my 22 inch at work is that most of the monitors that are over 20 inches It's kind of stupid to get them because what happens is you know you have a height.

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,164
Speaker 0: They do have a higher resolution.

28
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:49,023
Speaker 0: like the 20 inch can go to like 1600 by 1200 right and the 22 inch can go 1680 by 1050 80 pixels over 2 inches.

29
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:58,352
Speaker 0: I mean it's not it's 2 inches diagonally But that's the pixels on the 22 inch monitor or bigger.

30
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:02,967
Speaker 0: thus the image is lower quality Like if you look at the monitor on my laptop.

31
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:07,746
Speaker 0: It's a 10.6 inch screen, but it's 1280 by 768.

32
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:16,825
Speaker 1: It's not that it's lower quality It's that the viewing radius of how far away you can be and still see a good picture is increased I guess.

33
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:18,294
Speaker 0: but do I really that logic?

34
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:19,279
Speaker 1: Why do you ever have a TV?

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,832
Speaker 1: That's what if you had a one inch by one inch screen?

36
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:23,400
Speaker 1: There was like a million by a million pixels.

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,122
Speaker 1: That's not good.

38
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:24,924
Speaker 0: Well.

39
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:28,112
Speaker 0: No, but the the point is how a monitor.

40
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:30,258
Speaker 0: you're sitting pretty close to it so bigger.

41
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:32,317
Speaker 0: close I'm pretty close.

42
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:39,460
Speaker 1: I'm probably gonna go with a 22 inch widescreen with the 1680 by whatever resolution And I have it at work and the pixels are too big.

43
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:40,245
Speaker 1: I don't know.

44
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,399
Speaker 1: I've used them at work too, and they don't doesn't bother me at all.

45
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:51,360
Speaker 0: Yeah I definitely have seen the 20 inches and with the same or slightly lower resolution the image quality is far sharper and far superior.

46
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:55,976
Speaker 1: To me the image quality is the same partly because I sit slightly further away from my monitor than you do.

47
00:02:55,996 --> 00:03:01,698
Speaker 0: I Just put the monitor on the desk, and then I sit at depending on where the desk is not where the monitor is.

48
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,920
Speaker 0: hmm Yeah, I also don't really have a need to be that far away from my monitor.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,060
Speaker 0: It's like I'm not going across the room to watch a video or something.

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,301
Speaker 0: That's.

51
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:13,439
Speaker 0: that's why TVs should be big because you sit across the room.

52
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:25,500
Speaker 0: But then again TVs also need some high resolution or else you get the syndrome like where we have the Mac plugged into our TV You can't read the text of them making it huge because there's not enough pixels to render the fonts properly.

53
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:30,258
Speaker 1: I'd argue more vehemently, but I'm eating some habanero cheddar cheese, and it's pretty awesome.

54
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:34,948
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway What kind of news actions going on?

55
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:35,129
Speaker 1: Oh?

56
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,420
Speaker 1: I thought you're gonna tell everyone we're going to mocha one last chance.

57
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,324
Speaker 0: Oh right right.

58
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:39,188
Speaker 0: so tomorrow this way.

59
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,956
Speaker 1: I could eat more cheese not tomorrow.

60
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:54,566
Speaker 0: Saturday Saturday June 23rd 2007 we are going to go to the Museum of comic and cartoon art arts Festival and that is not a redundant.

61
00:03:54,646 --> 00:04:01,420
Speaker 0: art like I said yesterday is an arts festival at the Museum of comic and cartoon art And it's pretty awesome.

62
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:15,188
Speaker 0: You know we always kind of rag on comic conventions because they're full of nerds buying you know super ultra old Crappy Silver Age books for like $50 like those two guys Interviewed at the Philly wizard world and they were.

63
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,493
Speaker 1: I was like what kind of comics you like?

64
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,908
Speaker 1: and the one guy said oh I only read Silver Age, whatever.

65
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:22,460
Speaker 1: and the other guys like yes, there's nothing else worth reading.

66
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:32,423
Speaker 0: Yeah So we don't like those kind of places because a lot of plus the the attitude of collecting as opposed to Enjoying art is not so About that.

67
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:33,606
Speaker 1: listen to last night's episode.

68
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:38,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the mocha everything is totally turned upside down.

69
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:45,091
Speaker 0: first of all it is much more heavily populated with the indie comics than the superhero underwear perfect comics.

70
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:54,377
Speaker 0: and second of all It's it's like just like a big artists alley you go up to a table And if there's a comic there whoever makes that comic is sitting at that table like 99% of the time.

71
00:04:55,402 --> 00:05:02,860
Speaker 0: you know you're not like going up to a Dealers room where someone some retailer you don't want to talk to is selling the comic that you want.

72
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:08,169
Speaker 0: it's just an artist alley pretty much and Everyone there is sort of on an even playing field.

73
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:28,699
Speaker 0: you've got big-name people or relatively big-name people You know who like what Eisner awards and have so published their comics widely around the world in many languages sold thousands and thousands of copies and right next to them is some punk kid who Xeroxed his frickin Comic at Kinko's this morning, and he's stapling it together as you're standing there, and he's like hey, how you doing?

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,183
Speaker 0: Read my comic.

75
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:33,697
Speaker 1: I'm sure our regular listeners wanted to hear you say exactly what you said yesterday.

76
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:34,320
Speaker 1: all over again.

77
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:48,420
Speaker 0: That's fine because there are some people who didn't listen today And there's not much else to say about the convention other than if you like comics And you are anywhere within striking distance of New York City you have no reason not to go on Saturday unless you're doing something Saturday, man

78
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,532
Speaker 1: I recently remembered when I picked up that prison comics last year And I just remembered how funny that thing was

79
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:57,449
Speaker 0: that that was a great comic And we will get many more like it and then talk about.

80
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:00,540
Speaker 1: you know what I like more than killing, but nothing stab.

81
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:11,420
Speaker 1: So in the news this is kind of big news partly because of the hilarity just provided us for up the Pirate Bay That upstanding bastion of freedom on the internet.

82
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:14,560
Speaker 1: They have decided that they're going to law well going to launch.

83
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:25,760
Speaker 1: They already did launch a new site called Bay IMG Bay image And what it is according to them is a censorship free image hosting website where anyone in the world can anonymously?

84
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:28,739
Speaker 1: Upload any image and tag it and it'll be there forever.

85
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:32,284
Speaker 0: See this is really awesome But it's also really bad.

86
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:37,600
Speaker 0: the reason it's awesome is because all those people who want to like put their avatar in a forum.

87
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:50,252
Speaker 0: Or they want to link to an image But they don't want a hot link to someone else's server or they do hot link to someone else's server, and they get some bad image or They use stupid image shack, and then they go over the bandwidth limit.

88
00:06:50,673 --> 00:06:52,620
Speaker 0: all this stupid shit is now over with.

89
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:53,664
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

90
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,350
Speaker 1: I don't think that's really the intent of this.

91
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,900
Speaker 0: I know, but that it does solve that problem.

92
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,686
Speaker 1: Regardless I doubt it does.

93
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:03,760
Speaker 1: I'll bet there will be some sort of hot linking prevention in the future to keep the bandwidth from exploding.

94
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:04,984
Speaker 0: Then what's the point?

95
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:17,480
Speaker 1: the point is to upload things that aren't censored that whatever you put up There is gonna stay up there, so if you put up a picture of Muhammad and sure enough There's a tag Muhammad, and it is nothing but derogatory pictures of Muhammad

96
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:25,626
Speaker 0: Well, I think the problem with that is that of course it's all gonna be nasty nasty prong that no one wants to see Except the people putting it there.

97
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:34,135
Speaker 1: well the thing is I looked at it, and I decided all right I'm flipping through the slash comments and someone links to it and what they link to is the Digimon tag.

98
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:35,680
Speaker 1: now the Digimon tag.

99
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:36,365
Speaker 1: This is.

100
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:40,026
Speaker 1: these are the first images I saw on This Pirate Bay thing.

101
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:43,958
Speaker 1: it was nothing, but Digimon pornography.

102
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:50,400
Speaker 1: in fact It was all Digimon pornography of one specific animal from Digimon.

103
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:53,695
Speaker 0: Well, I mean one specific Digimon one specific Digimon.

104
00:07:54,338 --> 00:08:00,419
Speaker 0: ah I went to the Pokemons, and there was like a Pidgeo doing something, and it wasn't pretty well.

105
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:10,089
Speaker 1: So of course I immediately noticed the lolcat tag, and I've realized that I I love lolcats And sometimes I forget how much I love lolcats.

106
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,641
Speaker 0: Lolcats are awesome with their Monorails.

107
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:17,793
Speaker 1: the thing is I like the idea of a repository in the world.

108
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:26,679
Speaker 1: you can anonymously put pictures or Information or anything out there for the whole world to see with no possible chance of anyone getting back to you anyone punishing you.

109
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:31,380
Speaker 1: This could be a great thing for oppressed people like people in China or Albion.

110
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:34,370
Speaker 0: People in China are gonna be able to get to this site.

111
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,220
Speaker 1: Let me tell you yeah, but still I like the idea of it.

112
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:49,640
Speaker 1: The problem is it's already full of spam and porn and I'll bet within a few more weeks The child porn that is going to be attempted to be uploaded by it will in and of itself bandwidth wise bring it down

113
00:08:50,202 --> 00:09:05,160
Speaker 0: most likely, but I think that what they should have done is they as Being an uncensored image thing is kind of while I admire that and a sort of agree that it needs to exist It's gonna be really difficult to filter out bad images.

114
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:18,160
Speaker 0: It's not like filtering out bad text which you can actually do programmatically like someone in order to filter out bad images Like child porn and any other illegal images because I think what they say that anything illegal in Sweden would be taken off.

115
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,211
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a free-for-all.

116
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,120
Speaker 1: I found this kind of funny.

117
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:26,904
Speaker 1: They said oh, this is gonna be an uncensored repository of images, but don't upload anything That's illegal in Sweden.

118
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:27,907
Speaker 1: are we gonna take it down.

119
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:31,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, they gotta have some freaking army of people looking at stuff and taking it.

120
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:40,243
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be easy but I think they should have just tried to solve the image shack problem because that's a problem that is still plaguing the internet and No one solved.

121
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:50,260
Speaker 0: I mean we they jump straight to the YouTube solving the problem for videos and Libs didn't solve the problem for audios, I guess but no one remembered to solve the problem for images.

122
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:53,392
Speaker 1: You realize that in terms of avatars linking to images.

123
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:55,500
Speaker 1: There are a lot of solutions.

124
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:58,914
Speaker 1: Most of them work really well and people who don't most of them kind of suck.

125
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:06,431
Speaker 1: people like oh Frickin bandwidth limits and they only suck because people try to use them for things They were not intended for.

126
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:11,199
Speaker 1: if you want to host I mean there are ways to host images that cost trivial amounts of money.

127
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,373
Speaker 0: See what it needs to be free.

128
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:22,360
Speaker 1: YouTube is free And if the way to host images is not free But Scott there's money in YouTube because there are ways to generate advertising revenue from something like YouTube.

129
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:28,420
Speaker 1: There's no way to generate advertising revenue from a site that serves nothing but hotlinked images.

130
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,736
Speaker 0: Does the bay image seem to be making money from advertising revenue?

131
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,686
Speaker 0: hell no So they don't.

132
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:35,274
Speaker 1: they're not gonna allow hot linking.

133
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:38,359
Speaker 1: if they do all right now I'm certain they're gonna stop that right quick.

134
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,617
Speaker 1: The reason YouTube works is that?

135
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:42,205
Speaker 1: Wally can show you the thing.

136
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:46,299
Speaker 1: it can also show you the related things or the ads and you want to go to YouTube.

137
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:47,360
Speaker 1: people Go to YouTube.

138
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,491
Speaker 1: No one's gonna go to a site that hosts a million twelve-year-old.

139
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:52,553
Speaker 1: to put the reason you.

140
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:58,618
Speaker 0: the reason YouTube got so big is Because people can embed the youtubes in their own page.

141
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:02,620
Speaker 1: yes But still with the link back to YouTube and people have a reason to go to YouTube.

142
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:05,590
Speaker 1: No one would ever go to a site that hosted people's avatars.

143
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:06,875
Speaker 1: There's no reason to.

144
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:08,400
Speaker 1: it's nothing but stupid avatars.

145
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:10,539
Speaker 1: There's no way to make money off of that ever.

146
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,248
Speaker 0: It's not about making money that the Pirate Bay.

147
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:14,654
Speaker 0: were they making money on the Pirate Bay?

148
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,937
Speaker 1: because if they don't allow hot linking this Thing will be okay.

149
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:17,845
Speaker 1: they could.

150
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:25,460
Speaker 0: they couldn't afford I don't think to see that without the Hot-linking and you know using it as an image host for images to post elsewhere on the internet.

151
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:27,040
Speaker 0: I have no use for this site.

152
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,571
Speaker 0: I can just go to Google Images to find an image if I want one.

153
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,640
Speaker 1: this is so you can go and browse around it.

154
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,400
Speaker 1: Besides I think this is in the end kind of a dumb idea, and it's gonna fail just for technical limitations.

155
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:42,440
Speaker 1: But there's no reason to give free good hot linkable image hosting on the internet because there's nobody needs that.

156
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:43,891
Speaker 1: But there's no way you can make money.

157
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:44,678
Speaker 1: No one's gonna do it.

158
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,282
Speaker 0: Why?

159
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:47,895
Speaker 0: there's no good reason to make a Pirate Bay torrent tracker.

160
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,740
Speaker 0: There's no way to make money.

161
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:56,757
Speaker 1: Oh because the Pirate Bay torrent tracker Generates far less bandwidth than an image hosting site would in the end.

162
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,240
Speaker 0: well It's regardless.

163
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:09,697
Speaker 0: I think that while this is cool to look at maybe once if it's not useful as a place to host Images to use elsewhere on the internet which rim seems to say it isn't because it shouldn't be.

164
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:10,500
Speaker 1: that's not the purpose.

165
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,699
Speaker 1: They very clearly the purpose was to have an uncensored place where people can upload images.

166
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,863
Speaker 1: well Have them up there.

167
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:22,260
Speaker 0: I think that's interesting and I applaud them, but I have no use for it, and I really don't care.

168
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I didn't say it had a use.

169
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:25,860
Speaker 1: it failed already.

170
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:30,462
Speaker 1: But your idea is completely contrary to what anyone cares about with this I think.

171
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:35,360
Speaker 0: but I think that's what would make it successful because if it was what I say it should be successful.

172
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,648
Speaker 1: How they couldn't afford that no one can.

173
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:39,072
Speaker 0: I don't see why they couldn't.

174
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,898
Speaker 0: they seem to be able to affording the Pirate Bay.

175
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:50,888
Speaker 1: the Pirate Bay is probably less bandwidth, and if you tried to host all the FARC images that get up there Or someone's forum avatar that gets seen a billion times Uh-huh, whatever.

176
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,559
Speaker 0: We'll see in the end.

177
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:56,891
Speaker 0: Meh, I'm not gonna go here really if the if it's not you.

178
00:12:56,911 --> 00:13:02,066
Speaker 1: I went there once and I saw Pokemon porn and Digimon porn And it was somewhat inescapable.

179
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:07,158
Speaker 1: in seeing that I I'm not gonna go back because I can go to a site like FARC to see locads.

180
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:13,095
Speaker 0: Well, I just tested it and hot linking totally works, so now this site is useful.

181
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:14,520
Speaker 1: I doubt is gonna stay that way.

182
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:15,310
Speaker 1: That's just my guess.

183
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,648
Speaker 0: well I think that that is how it's gonna stay.

184
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,180
Speaker 0: because what's the point of image hosting if it says image?

185
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,360
Speaker 0: Hosting if it's just an image gallery on their site?

186
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,368
Speaker 0: That's not the same as image hosting.

187
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:32,300
Speaker 0: you see what I'm saying hosting is when you host my image And I use it elsewhere.

188
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:38,382
Speaker 0: So I have a feeling that it is gonna be hot linking and now image shack and all those people better run for cover because They're screwed.

189
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:45,349
Speaker 1: because they made a big point about saying that it's uncensored and it's all tagged Both because I don't see that.

190
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,656
Speaker 1: I just don't see it sticking around.

191
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:51,392
Speaker 1: I don't see it being Available or able to deal with the bandwidth over time.

192
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:55,647
Speaker 0: if they're able to deal with the Pirate Bay I think they can deal with some images.

193
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:56,349
Speaker 1: We'll see.

194
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,316
Speaker 0: they was they wouldn't do it, and they there goes.

195
00:13:58,356 --> 00:13:59,640
Speaker 0: those guys know technology.

196
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:02,028
Speaker 0: They wouldn't do it and allow the hot linking.

197
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:05,620
Speaker 1: Scott you realize they also allow image files up to a hundred megabytes.

198
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:07,018
Speaker 1: We'll see how long this lasts.

199
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:12,321
Speaker 0: I guess we will see how long it lasts that that a hundred megabyte image file that got Plus.

200
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:14,691
Speaker 0: it'll be popular and FARC would screw them over.

201
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,820
Speaker 1: plus the fact that you know they say it's uncensored.

202
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,010
Speaker 1: But that's absolutely not true according to the other things.

203
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,040
Speaker 1: They said I just really don't trust this to be useful at all.

204
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:38,739
Speaker 0: Yeah So basically my prediction if it doesn't work as a thing that beats out image shack and equivalents No one will care about it for very long And if it does then it will just replace all those things and but very few people actually go to the site.

205
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:39,985
Speaker 0: because What do you want?

206
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:42,380
Speaker 0: to just browse random images for this Google image search?

207
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:49,920
Speaker 1: I point out that 4chan is extremely popular, and it's nothing but variously pornographic images and people browsing them and comment.

208
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,300
Speaker 0: Yes, but it comes up in sort of like this time-based way as opposed to this just tag cloud.

209
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,292
Speaker 1: That's a big mess, but for those people the tag clouds even better.

210
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,236
Speaker 1: They click on lolcat.

211
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:00,060
Speaker 1: They see their lolcat.

212
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:01,304
Speaker 1: They click on Digimon.

213
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:03,552
Speaker 1: they see their Digimon form the Digimon form.

214
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:10,834
Speaker 1: they might they might have trouble hosting elsewhere, but they can't Comment on it, so I don't think anything that's ever been posted to.

215
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:14,567
Speaker 0: 4chan actually counts as a comment But it gets replied to with another image.

216
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:16,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time.

217
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:18,080
Speaker 1: They're almost entirely unrelated.

218
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:27,417
Speaker 0: I think what's gonna happen is all the images that you see on 4chan will be hosted on the bay image and linked into the 4chan In which case it just becomes 4chan without the comments, which I don't know.

219
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:27,778
Speaker 1: what that is.

220
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:33,055
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is either, but well I guess it also has a different community than 4chan.

221
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:36,555
Speaker 0: it has the entire Internets as opposed to the 4chan internets.

222
00:15:36,897 --> 00:15:41,635
Speaker 1: one thing that got me I was surprised that I saw the wet like the link on slash down, and it wasn't.

223
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:44,184
Speaker 1: oh, they're gonna do this It's oh, it's already up.

224
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:46,050
Speaker 0: Yeah that really got me.

225
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:46,492
Speaker 0: It was like.

226
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:47,756
Speaker 0: Oh, they couldn't do it.

227
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,161
Speaker 0: Oh it exists there It is.

228
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,753
Speaker 1: yeah, I just I don't think it's gonna last.

229
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,380
Speaker 1: I think something bad is gonna happen to it.

230
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,741
Speaker 1: I do

231
00:15:53,782 --> 00:16:06,300
Speaker 0: think Steve Jobs got it right though, and you know he decided to start announcing Apple products Like right before they came out and announcing the iPhone way before it came out was a bad move But I guess he had to because he needed the FCC approval and all that jazz

232
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,682
Speaker 1: I don't know.

233
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:14,656
Speaker 1: What could have been interesting is if they just put the FCC thing in and Just refuse to say anything at all about the iPhone.

234
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:28,438
Speaker 1: despite that That would be okay I guess cuz then basically without doing anything there would have been a Constant on not underground, but internet PR machine just working itself into a frenzy Waiting for him to acknowledge their their PR machine seems to be working just fine.

235
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:33,600
Speaker 1: anyway iPhone's gonna do just fine despite the fact that I think it's kind of silly.

236
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:39,146
Speaker 0: Regardless if I was a company of any sort I would announce things as They were ready and not before.

237
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,493
Speaker 0: cuz I've learned that mistake already.

238
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,836
Speaker 0: like a couple times the geek nights like yeah We're gonna have a DVD.

239
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:53,070
Speaker 0: Yeah From now on I'm only going to announce things if I'm holding if I'm ready to just push the button and make them go And that's the way it's gonna be right.

240
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,600
Speaker 1: so what do you got for me in the news on this lazy Thursday?

241
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,708
Speaker 1: Where I really want to continue playing Counter-Strike source.

242
00:16:58,989 --> 00:16:59,671
Speaker 0: Yeah, well.

243
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:02,359
Speaker 0: I've always said you know stuff about.

244
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,327
Speaker 0: So you know the soldiers in Iraq.

245
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,536
Speaker 0: if they disagree with the Iraq war what should they do?

246
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:08,078
Speaker 0: bla bla bla right?

247
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,046
Speaker 0: Well one guy in the army somewhere Now they even get a fig.

248
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:15,473
Speaker 0: I can not even bother reading his name here.

249
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:27,240
Speaker 0: basically he said Yeah, he went to his superior officer, and he said yeah I'm against the war and I'm no longer gonna play a combat role, and I'm no longer gonna protect corporate representatives.

250
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,686
Speaker 0: Whatever he means by that all right.

251
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:32,019
Speaker 1: I hate to say it, but this guy already sounds a little bit nutty.

252
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:33,494
Speaker 0: That's not a little bit nutty.

253
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,400
Speaker 0: But while I'm sort of on his side like yeah, I don't want to fight in that war either.

254
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,087
Speaker 0: You know I can.

255
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:42,914
Speaker 0: I can see where you're coming from.

256
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:46,087
Speaker 0: you already Volunteered before.

257
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:54,030
Speaker 0: you can't be forced into the US Army, so You changed your mind Kind of can't do that.

258
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,940
Speaker 1: I want to join the army and go to college.

259
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,225
Speaker 1: You know if there's a war you got a fight.

260
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:59,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever there won't be a war and then there is.

261
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:01,284
Speaker 0: I didn't agree to This.

262
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:03,304
Speaker 0: yes, you did Tough shit.

263
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:16,969
Speaker 1: I'm generally of the mind that outside of extreme cases like if Genocide is about to occur or you're ordered to do something that is clearly Immoral and illegal like a boo grieve type stuff.

264
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,175
Speaker 1: Yeah in any other situation.

265
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:31,572
Speaker 1: I really don't think that members of the military of a sovereign nation should take it upon themselves to voice political or social opinion or Refuse officer are refused legal orders.

266
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:32,214
Speaker 0: Yes, they.

267
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:32,415
Speaker 0: so

268
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:53,760
Speaker 1: while at that point That's what happened to Rome when the military starts becoming politicized, and I think one of the Biggest things that has made America not collapse over the last several hundred years well two or three hundred years give or take is That the military is by and large just done whatever it's been ordered even if what it was ordered to do Maybe say in the case of Iraq was stupid.

269
00:18:54,522 --> 00:19:09,363
Speaker 0: Yeah, so as much as I'm against the Iraq war and I gotta feel bad for someone fighting it who doesn't want to be This guy's going to the military jail most likely and that's where he belongs and the court-martial Is in his future.

270
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:12,373
Speaker 1: I can't say that I have that much sympathy for him sadly.

271
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:21,060
Speaker 0: No, but at the same time People are basically saying, you know, he's taking an incredible risk blah blah blah, but other people get it already.

272
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,683
Speaker 1: He's not new.

273
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,935
Speaker 1: a lot of people have done this since the Iraq war started.

274
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:24,337
Speaker 0: He's like.

275
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:26,204
Speaker 0: they're like, oh no He's gonna be court-martialed.

276
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:31,620
Speaker 0: and then all they say is let's make sure that they don't do anything illegal against him.

277
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:38,107
Speaker 0: You know make sure they only give him what he deserves according to the military law and they don't you know secretly Kill him or something.

278
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're gonna secretly kill him.

279
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:40,457
Speaker 1: They'd get away with that.

280
00:19:40,477 --> 00:19:41,120

281
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,190

282
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,356
Speaker 1: we all know what's going on in that prison.

283
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:54,916
Speaker 0: Oh See ya, I just thought it was interesting that you know people don't really notice when this happens so much.

284
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,100
Speaker 0: and well here it happens.

Speaker 0: All right, so you begin praise Jesus.

294
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:30,223
Speaker 1: you won't be saved without Jesus.

295
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:33,313
Speaker 1: you have to start believing in Jesus to be saved.

296
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,419
Speaker 0: Jesus will always be there for you.

297
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:39,614
Speaker 0: Would it would it be so awful if we pushed her out when the doors open?

298
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:44,470
Speaker 1: no, Jesus will save her The next one.

299
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:47,846
Speaker 0: I think so, all right Paper beats rock BAM.

00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,950
Speaker 0: Your rock is blowed up.

301
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:50,374
Speaker 1: BAM doesn't blow up.

302
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:51,679
Speaker 1: BAM makes it spicy.

303
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,350
Speaker 1: now I got a spicy rock.

304
00:20:53,391 --> 00:20:54,257
Speaker 1: You can't defeat that.

305
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,224
Speaker 0: So what this?

306
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:58,408
Speaker 0: where these are from is?

307
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:01,056
Speaker 0: there's a website called overheard in New York.

308
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:05,271
Speaker 0: calm and Basically what people do is they write there.

309
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:10,480
Speaker 0: they write down things that they supposedly overheard people saying in New York.

310
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:17,609
Speaker 0: So if you're sitting in a restaurant and someone near you has a funny conversation that you happen to overhear You type it into this website and there it is.

311
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:23,370
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure not all of these are true But regardless of that, I'm sure some of them are.

312
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:29,197
Speaker 0: in fact, probably the majority are and this page I'm linking to you has the most popular ones.

313
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:32,613
Speaker 0: and If you like the two things we just acted out.

315
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,029

Speaker 0: Man I would totally hit that dude.

320
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:54,717

00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:04,055
Speaker 0: Mother.

326
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:07,908
Speaker 0: The mother says Don't you ever do that again and then slaps the kid.

327
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,520
Speaker 0: and then the kid calmly says well, are you happy with yourself?

328
00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:20,980
Speaker 0: That happened in Union Square Supposedly and oh the title is the Buddha was a tough kid to raise.

329
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:21,792
Speaker 0: *laughter*.

00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,359
Speaker 1: That's the win.

331
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:30,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you want some I don't know good 10-20 minutes of humor depending on how fast you read and how long you laugh.

332
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,625
Speaker 0: Check this page out.

333
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:35,660
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day is all over dig and it's in the forum and I think it's pretty good.

334
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,460
Speaker 1: I just want to link to it because when I actually got around to watching it I really liked the little song and dance in the middle.

335
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:50,378
Speaker 0: I did also like the song and dance and it was like one part of me was like I like that song and I like that dance but damn that's horrible.

336
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,483
Speaker 1: Yeah I think the word we're looking for is macabre Perhaps perhaps.

337
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:57,128
Speaker 0: I don't know if it really counts as macabre.

338
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,315
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty macabre all things considered.

339
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:02,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's definitely It's really a macabre.

340
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:07,817
Speaker 0: Let's go look up what macabre actually means while you describe this video.

341
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:15,716
Speaker 1: All right Well, I don't want to spoil it because you'll figure out what's going on pretty handily, but it's an awesome awesome Incredibly, okay.

342
00:23:17,102 --> 00:23:26,190
Speaker 0: Um, okay just to show that how rim correct how correct you are The I'm gonna read the three definitions of macabre.

343
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,671
Speaker 0: Are you ready?

344
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:27,233
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

345
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:31,126
Speaker 0: number one gruesome and horrifying Ghastly horrible.

346
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:32,833
Speaker 0: All right, it is those things.

347
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:41,200
Speaker 0: Yeah - of Pertaining to dealing with or representing death, especially is grimmer or uglier aspect.

348
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:43,787
Speaker 0: I know you ready for number three.

349
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:54,379
Speaker 0: I'm ready of or suggesting I can't of or suggestive of the allegorical dance of death.

350
00:23:57,701 --> 00:24:00,572
Speaker 0: And that is exactly what this video is.

351
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,017
Speaker 0: it is macabre definition.

352
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:05,652
Speaker 0: number three Suggestive of the allegorical dance of death.

353
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:10,176
Speaker 1: now I defy you Despite I mean this doesn't say a lot.

354
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:13,099
Speaker 1: I mean the I guess the moral of this.

355
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:17,535
Speaker 1: Well defense of what kind of person you are because you might think the moral is damn dead.

356
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:18,880
Speaker 1: people dancing is awesome.

357
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:20,646
Speaker 0: No, that's not what the moral is.

358
00:24:20,987 --> 00:24:24,540
Speaker 1: Or maybe the moral is you know what it's worth any sacrifice for art?

359
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:25,804
Speaker 0: No, that's not.

360
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:27,932
Speaker 0: what the more not just watch it.

361
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:28,816
Speaker 1: I really like it.

362
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:38,699
Speaker 1: The animation is amazing Yeah and I defy you to watch it and not at least You'll be bobbing your head and kind of dancing with a guy or at least half in your foot I guarantee it.

363
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

364
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:41,576
Speaker 0: the message though.

365
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:51,565
Speaker 0: Is that You you know You don't these people they send people off to war as if they're trying to create a work of art with people's lives And that's that's probably not good.

366
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:53,753
Speaker 0: and that's not good something like that.

367
00:24:53,853 --> 00:24:54,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

368
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:55,740
Speaker 1: All right.

369
00:24:55,861 --> 00:25:00,480
Speaker 1: So without further ado she was actually a man Rims gay.

370
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:07,940
Speaker 0: That's not a spoiler It's not the point Charlie wins the chocolate factory at the end of this episode.

371
00:25:08,362 --> 00:25:09,486
Speaker 0: We played the same closer.

372
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:10,349
Speaker 0: We plan every episode.

373
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,777
Speaker 1: James Bond gets the girl in the end.

374
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:13,520
Speaker 0: Sometimes he doesn't.

375
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,309
Speaker 1: I think he almost always does.

376
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:16,396
Speaker 1: Oh depends.

377
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:17,080
Speaker 0: All right, not in the end.

378
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,120
Speaker 1: How about just James Bond gets the girl at some point at some point?

379
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,170
Speaker 1: He gets the girl like ten times private Ryan.

380
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:25,277
Speaker 1: He uh, he makes it to the end.

381
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:26,060
Speaker 0: Oh, does he?

382
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:28,607
Speaker 1: It wasn't worth saying okay.

383
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:31,516
Speaker 0: Well, I thought it was about saving private Ryan, right?

384
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:32,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they win.

385
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,691
Speaker 0: Oh it but isn't like a guy they're going to find and then save.

386
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:36,173
Speaker 0: Yeah.

387
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they find him.

388
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:40,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay I thought he was one of those things that look for a guy.

389
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,023
Speaker 0: Oh, not really there.

390
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:44,594
Speaker 1: Jesus gets whipped the shit out of but then he comes back.

391
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:45,978
Speaker 0: We know that one.

392
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:50,530
Speaker 0: Yeah So a lot of people especially certainly greatest people.

393
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, Rosebud was a slide.

Speaker 1: they especially in the model at O'Hare is a bitch.

398
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:17,166
Speaker 0: in the modern times of the Internet's Spoilers have become more and more of an issue and a lot of people have different opinions on to how Spoilers should be dealt with.

399
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:22,828
Speaker 0: a lot of people say, you know, ah, you know There's a satchel limitations on these things.

400
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:26,459
Speaker 0: if it's older than like a few years and you didn't see it already tough shit.

401
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:30,692
Speaker 0: and other People say oh, you should never spoil anything for everybody you ass.

402
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:33,200
Speaker 0: and other people say and who cares?

403
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,447
Speaker 0: It's your own damn fault.

404
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,857
Speaker 0: You should have been listening.

405
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:45,439
Speaker 1: Whatever I really have mixed feelings about it because on one hand it would Sudden me greatly if someone who had not seen cowboy bebop had the end ruin for them before they saw it.

406
00:26:45,861 --> 00:26:48,693
Speaker 1: Like that would bother me and it really bothers me when people spoil.

407
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,717
Speaker 1: things like that are in my presence Not just anime, but anything like that.

408
00:26:52,221 --> 00:26:59,668
Speaker 1: But at the same time when those people were running around all over the internet spoiling the Harry Potter book before it came out That was awesome.

409
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:07,980
Speaker 1: I couldn't help but laugh hysterically every time I ran into someone in counter-strike named OMG Snape or Dumbledore dies.

410
00:27:08,382 --> 00:27:09,267
Speaker 0: Is that what is that?

411
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,654
Speaker 1: or Snape kills Dumbledore?

412
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:11,398
Speaker 0: That's what it was.

413
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:15,060
Speaker 0: Yeah I remember on that day someone was playing counter-strike with that name.

414
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:19,179
Speaker 1: Remember very specifically, you know what multiple people were playing with that name that day?

415
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,824
Speaker 1: I think there were servers.

416
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:27,543
Speaker 0: people are making user new accounts on sites like slash dot and Fark with that is the username It was.

417
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:32,057
Speaker 1: and while it might have been just as horrible as a spoiler for some reason.

418
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:37,820
Speaker 1: I found it hilarious Maybe because I don't care about Harry Potter maybe or maybe because people took it so seriously.

419
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:44,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think generally the but my personal spoiler policy, right?

420
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,470
Speaker 0: Is that I'm not gonna go spoiling something on purpose?

421
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,794
Speaker 0: because what what's the point?

422
00:27:48,854 --> 00:27:54,327
Speaker 0: Well, except for all the things we just spoiled Well, I mean, you know something You know that at like actively like.

423
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:57,337

424
00:27:57,397 --> 00:27:58,340
Speaker 1: are we spoiled something for?

00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,102
Speaker 1: Someone just now.

426
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:08,994

427
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:13,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, even remember anyone, dude I don't even remember a point at which it was spoiled.

428
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:16,740
Speaker 0: It's just like I always knew like I always knew my name was Scott.

429
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:24,697
Speaker 1: Well, I do remember the wonderful story Greg told us back in the day about how they came out of the.

430
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:37,649
Speaker 1: it was that I think was the second episode of Star Wars like the new episodes yeah, and they're walking out and there's the line of people going in to see the second showing like the one right after the midnight showing and He just says kind of loudly man.

431
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:38,916
Speaker 1: I can't believe they killed Yoda.

432
00:28:38,937 --> 00:28:39,520
Speaker 1: That was crap.

433
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,827
Speaker 0: This is this was Star Wars Episode 2.

434
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:46,441
Speaker 0: So if you're smart you realize Yoda dies in episode 6.

435
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:49,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, so how could he possibly die in episode?

436
00:28:49,413 --> 00:28:51,100
Speaker 1: So he says this, you know, I can't believe they killed Yoda.

437
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,702
Speaker 1: That's crap.

438
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,872
Speaker 1: and some guy in the lines like way to go asshole.

439
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:57,180
Speaker 1: and then he stops and realizes what he's just said.

440
00:28:57,381 --> 00:29:03,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just got eggs his head while the crowd starts flat pointing and laughing pointing laughing Laughing.

441
00:29:03,902 --> 00:29:16,460
Speaker 1: is the awesome that that is perhaps the best kind of spoiler in the world because you get all of the shock and the humor of a spoiler Plus the humiliation of an idiot plus you didn't actually spoil anything.

442
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:28,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, my feeling though more recently is that you know, okay a spoiler can potentially ruin someone's Potential experience of a work of art like six cents.

443
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:32,440
Speaker 0: six cents can the movie can provide like how long is it?

444
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,278
Speaker 0: Like a couple hours.

445
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:42,239
Speaker 0: Well, unless you're smart unless you're smart But it could potentially provide a couple hours of pretty awesome entertainment with a with a very enjoyable shock at the end.

446
00:29:42,901 --> 00:29:48,435
Speaker 0: But if someone tells you right what the shock at the end is then you are.

447
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:53,913
Speaker 0: you basically lost all this potential Enjoyment you could have might have gained while watching this movie.

448
00:29:53,973 --> 00:29:57,967
Speaker 0: and now basically like six cents I believe is a movie that you cannot watch more than once.

449
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:00,696
Speaker 0: it's basically not in no circumstance.

450
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:05,194
Speaker 0: watching it a second time Would be any even close to as enjoyable as the first time.

451
00:30:05,314 --> 00:30:06,619
Speaker 1: see I could actually disagree there.

452
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:13,759
Speaker 1: Yeah because here's why when you watch through it the first time a lot of weird things happen and you might not remember them too clearly.

453
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:19,080
Speaker 1: like If you didn't figure it out you get to the end and suddenly you figure it out the way they handle.

454
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:39,513
Speaker 1: Thus the spoiler at the end of that throughout the movie to make sure that it makes sense is Actually pretty ingenious at a lot of times and if you watch the movie again Or if you just figured it out and knew what was going on the whole time It's almost a different movie just because you're watching How like you you can't imagine how you didn't pick it up before.

455
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:40,116
Speaker 0: Yeah, baby.

456
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,220
Speaker 0: It's a different movie.

457
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:51,140
Speaker 0: See, it's sort of like this this thing this sort of non-physical Like enjoy like specific enjoyment of a specific thing you could have attained has just been taken away from you.

458
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,746
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like an opportunity.

459
00:30:52,786 --> 00:31:01,948
Speaker 0: cost has been snatched from your future and you can no law You know unless someone brainwashes you or you lose your memory You're pretty much never gonna get it.

460
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:05,078
Speaker 1: But at the same time too as I talked about last night.

461
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:15,138
Speaker 1: I Spoiled neon Genesis Evangelion one of my favorite anime ever Entirely on my own by myself because I was an idiot long before I watched the show.

462
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:15,559
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

463
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:22,680
Speaker 1: So as a result, I watched the whole show Knowing how it ended and I saw it a lot differently as a result.

464
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,420
Speaker 1: But I can't say that the way I saw it in the end actually hindered my enjoyment of it.

465
00:31:27,661 --> 00:31:30,780
Speaker 1: But then again that might just be because of the direction Ava goes.

466
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:46,140
Speaker 0: Well, that's what I. that's what the point I'm getting at Is that if your work of art, you know because any kind of work of art can have a spoiler, you know If your work of art Can it's possible for someone to not be able to enjoy it fully or in a certain way?

467
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,870
Speaker 0: Because they know a certain piece of information.

468
00:31:49,352 --> 00:31:51,080
Speaker 0: What does that say about your work of art?

469
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,480
Speaker 0: It's only enjoyable for someone who doesn't know a certain piece of information.

470
00:31:54,804 --> 00:32:06,860
Speaker 1: But at the same time I debate There's also the idea like you could spoil the end of cowboy bebop and all that takes away is the shock of all the things That go on but it still doesn't take away the journey or the experience.

471
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:07,825
Speaker 0: That's why I can't be.

472
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:10,559
Speaker 0: bop is still watchable like 10,000 times and it doesn't suck.

473
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:11,403
Speaker 1: But I can't.

474
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:15,400
Speaker 1: I can't think of too many things where the spoiler in and of itself entirely ruins it.

475
00:32:15,781 --> 00:32:17,487
Speaker 0: There are some that ruin it.

476
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:19,234
Speaker 0: Maybe not entirely.

477
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:21,000
Speaker 1: the only war I can do one complete.

478
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:23,275
Speaker 1: I can think of one that would be the usual suspects.

479
00:32:23,436 --> 00:32:27,451
Speaker 0: Yeah Kind of I really like watching the usual suspects like a hundred times.

480
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:30,281
Speaker 0: I didn't figure that one out even why that was kind of Weird.

481
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:33,116
Speaker 0: it was like the one movie rim had never seen and I was like, oh my god.

482
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:36,229
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, I can watch that like a hundred times.

483
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:48,212
Speaker 1: our group has this problem where if there's it's not really a problem but whenever there's certain movies that each one of us has kind of up our bot like a stick and they're just always they're Bothering us if there's anyone in the world who hasn't seen these movies.

484
00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:49,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's so you haven't seen that.

485
00:32:49,918 --> 00:32:50,500
Speaker 0: sit down right now.

486
00:32:50,601 --> 00:33:02,498
Speaker 1: So like I have my list and Scott has his list everyone We know as their list and pretty much if anyone in the room admits to have never not seen one of the movies on Anyone's list someone's on their way to blockbuster already, even though we hate blockbuster.

487
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:05,695
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but it's the only place to get a movie on short notice.

488
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:06,579
Speaker 0: Well pirates Bay?

489
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:12,500
Speaker 0: Well, I guess blockbuster can even be faster than pirates.

490
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,775
Speaker 1: I think the real problem here is that it's you can't make spoilers.

491
00:33:16,815 --> 00:33:20,936
Speaker 1: go away because think about it They I think about all the things you a spoiler does.

492
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:27,436
Speaker 1: it's basically You can really color someone's perception of something and it takes zero effort on your part.

493
00:33:27,516 --> 00:33:32,395
Speaker 1: and yet it has this huge effect on a Person especially depending on the person in the movie and on the internet.

494
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:33,740
Speaker 0: It's also not necessarily movies.

495
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,888
Speaker 0: It could be video games comics novels.

496
00:33:35,988 --> 00:33:37,393
Speaker 1: She's an esper.

497
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:45,463
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott Johnson our friend Scott Johnson famously ruined Probably the.

498
00:33:45,543 --> 00:33:48,395
Speaker 1: I just wrote fantasy say yeah, we just spoiled it too, but you know what?

499
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:49,560
Speaker 1: statute of limitations?

500
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:50,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess.

501
00:33:50,986 --> 00:34:00,224
Speaker 1: but this was a while ago and even then I still felt statute of limitations but at the same time I'd always kind of avoided talking about the end of that game because I knew people hadn't played it and I kind of wanted him to.

502
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:08,130
Speaker 1: and Scott Johnson just out of the blue is like well at the end blah blah blah when she's an esper and blah blah blah and She's an esper is like the middle of the game.

503
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:11,609
Speaker 1: It's a little bit past the middle Yeah, but it's not like the the end.

504
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,041
Speaker 0: and that's not the big thing at the end, you know It's.

505
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:15,389
Speaker 1: I think it's more of a spoiler than the.

506
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,400
Speaker 0: it is more of a spoiler than the end itself.

507
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,906
Speaker 1: It's just whatever Final Fantasy.

508
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:20,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

509
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:33,413
Speaker 1: It's not like there wasn't enough foreshadowing for that But I just remember it turned out there was one person in the crew who had not played the game at that time and She turns around and flips ever living hell out on Scott.

510
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:34,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was good times.

511
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:42,420
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah, but basically my policy on spoilers is that you know, I'm not gonna go out of my way to spoil something.

512
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:47,120
Speaker 0: But if I feel that, you know, this is something that everyone's seen I'm kind of come.

513
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,478
Speaker 0: It's like if I'm comfortable just saying it in public.

514
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:56,159
Speaker 0: good I'm comfortable just saying it like I'm comfortable walking around the street going Darth Vader's Luke's father or Rosebud was the sled.

515
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:57,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not a problem.

516
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:59,918
Speaker 0: But saying other stuff is a problem.

517
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:02,489
Speaker 1: for a second I thought you were gonna spoil something big just to be funny.

518
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:04,035
Speaker 0: No, I wasn't because it's not.

519
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:05,060
Speaker 0: I'm not comfortable saying it.

520
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,593
Speaker 0: nah, and that's the point.

521
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:16,880
Speaker 0: and When I'm just in you know a new situation or just in general I'll follow my own personal guide and if that happens to conflict with yours as just the tough shit.

522
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:22,992
Speaker 1: But see the problem, but I was trying to allude to is that on the internet It takes no effort and yet you get all this result.

523
00:35:23,052 --> 00:35:33,940
Speaker 1: It's a great way to grief people Especially people who might not take it so well and there's really absolutely no way to protect yourself from it Other than to watch as much media as you can as fast as possible.

524
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:43,418
Speaker 0: See so what I do on the internet is you know on the internet if you're commenting You're usually in a forum or on a blog or something and I tend to do the when in Rome.

525
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:47,869
Speaker 0: on the internet You know depending on where I am I do what people in that place do.

526
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:50,900
Speaker 0: so on FARC people spoil whatever they don't care.

527
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:56,139
Speaker 1: So I do the same thing and actually there was a big uproar about the Harry Potter things on FARC.

528
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:06,087
Speaker 1: Well, but total Farkers were mad that pretty much every single story submitted for a day and a half was just Dumbledore dies Dumbledore dies snake Dumbledore.

529
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:07,271
Speaker 0: That's good stuff.

530
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:10,580
Speaker 1: But the thing is they're also a lot of fake spoilers, which has made it even more hilarious.

531
00:36:10,943 --> 00:36:12,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we'll talk about that in a second.

532
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:20,442
Speaker 0: But also like on a forum like people tend to do the put the word spoiler in your you know Topic.

533
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:32,888
Speaker 0: if you started the topic and you're making a comment use the hidden text and you know I do that, you know, cuz that's just whatever the people there do I'll do what they do and that way, you know No one can blame me for anything because that

534
00:36:32,908 --> 00:36:34,112
Speaker 1: really seems following the rules.

535
00:36:34,213 --> 00:36:37,468
Speaker 1: spoilers as far as I handle them it's any other.

536
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:41,208
Speaker 1: it's another matter of social etiquette and It seemed it generally.

537
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:47,356
Speaker 1: it's very crass to me or very Uncultured when especially at an anime club or an anime con.

538
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,240
Speaker 1: It's just a good example.

539
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:49,159
Speaker 0: That's a really bad.

540
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:56,940
Speaker 1: You can always tell the fanboys and the generally annoying people from the cool people Because the annoying people walk over and say like out of the blue.

541
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,410
Speaker 1: It's like they almost like they're not trying to spoil things.

542
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,080
Speaker 0: There's like they assume that you're because they're such nerds.

543
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:07,880
Speaker 0: They seem to assume that like you've seen what they've seen that you're watching like episodes as there are they come up like man.

544
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,380
Speaker 1: It was great when so-and-so died or God.

545
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:25,460
Speaker 1: I remember when I saw someone taking a picture of a cosplayer and then some other cosplayer walks up wearing another costume and both characters that they were cosplaying as Happened to have been killed in their respective animes and the guy says the other man, isn't it great?

546
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:31,720
Speaker 1: We're both playing characters who totally got killed in the middle of the anime and like ten people turned around and glared at them.

547
00:37:31,922 --> 00:37:41,363
Speaker 0: It was great Good times, but yeah, one thing that there are things you can do when you accidentally spoil something for somebody to Recuperate.

548
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,148
Speaker 1: well depending on the crowd.

549
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:44,211
Speaker 0: It does depend on the crowd.

550
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:49,944
Speaker 0: My favorite method though that I have to share with you is the doubt Creation method.

551
00:37:50,004 --> 00:38:00,858
Speaker 0: for example, I will tell rim a character X dies What or does character Y die as or does every character die?

552
00:38:00,898 --> 00:38:02,703
Speaker 0: See I Probably in.

553
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:08,484
Speaker 0: rim knows now that in all likelihood character X dies because of the way it might you know The way I said it.

554
00:38:08,564 --> 00:38:09,410
Speaker 0: it's kind of obvious.

555
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,054
Speaker 0: In fact, it's 99% obvious.

556
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:25,660
Speaker 0: But by saying those other things rim or someone who wanted to at least depending on rim wanted to or not He could in his mind Justify at least a small amount of doubt as to whether I actually just spoiled it for him or not.

557
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:34,480
Speaker 0: So while watching whatever it is I just spoiled or reading it He could keep in his mind the slight question of is it gonna be character X or Y?

558
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,699
Speaker 0: He'll probably be like I was probably X. Scott totally spoiled it for me.

559
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:40,093
Speaker 0: And then when he gets to it and it is X it like yup.

560
00:38:40,114 --> 00:38:41,160
Speaker 0: Scott totally spoiled it for me.

561
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:47,891
Speaker 0: but that small amount of doubt leaves a small possibility of Getting the original experience.

562
00:38:48,113 --> 00:38:50,584
Speaker 0: if you want it badly enough You can sort of you.

563
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:56,383
Speaker 0: you can grab on to that and create more doubt in your mind that it wasn't actually Spoiled for you.

564
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:57,869
Speaker 1: now, that's the immediate cover-up.

565
00:38:57,909 --> 00:39:00,499
Speaker 1: Let's say that you just for whatever reason tend to spoil things.

566
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,680
Speaker 1: often You're just not careful about it or you're worried about doing it in the future.

567
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:12,539
Speaker 1: You can inoculate everyone, you know against it by just kind of randomly always making jokes and falsely spoiling things all the time.

568
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:14,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many people like.

569
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:17,617
Speaker 1: they'll spoil anime randomly to kind of like yeah, everyone dies at the end of that.

570
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,388
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, they kill everyone.

571
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,819
Speaker 1: Yeah main character dies.

572
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:26,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, so like whenever you watch a new show be like I heard about this show and main character dies.

573
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:27,846
Speaker 0: Well, I heard about this show.

574
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:28,850
Speaker 0: No one dies at all.

575
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,460
Speaker 0: But yeah, the whole world explodes and they'll fly off into space.

576
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:33,891
Speaker 0: Yep, or yeah, I heard about this show.

577
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:35,900
Speaker 0: the second character gets syphilis.

578
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:38,870
Speaker 1: Now the funny thing is that the the everybody dies.

579
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,593
Speaker 1: cliche at least.

580
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:41,780
Speaker 1: anime came from the fact that there's a fairly killer.

581
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:43,268
Speaker 1: You know well-known.

582
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:45,459
Speaker 1: I anime a couple anime but one in particular.

583
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:45,680
Speaker 1: where?

584
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:49,840
Speaker 0: Everyone actually does die and quite a few anime where everyone dies.

585
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,739
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, at least almost everyone dies.

586
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:59,251
Speaker 1: But if you if you tell someone that especially someone who hasn't seen anime or just in general They just don't even assume that that's a possibility.

587
00:39:59,452 --> 00:40:01,440
Speaker 1: How many movies are there where everyone dies?

588
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:09,360
Speaker 1: I mean even in Doctor Strangelove at least a few people survived.

589
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:17,948
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it depends what you mean by everyone because this the everyone dies where the entire world and all humanity is gone Right, and then there's the everyone dies.

590
00:40:17,968 --> 00:40:18,249
Speaker 0: We're like.

591
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,814
Speaker 0: all the named characters die.

592
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:28,271
Speaker 0: So like Romeo and Juliet It's actually kind of fair to say everyone dies in a way, you know, but Benvolio doesn't die though No, but he's not everyone.

593
00:40:28,412 --> 00:40:31,403
Speaker 1: Yeah He's not everyone.

594
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:32,987
Speaker 1: he's a semi-major character.

595
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:34,592
Speaker 0: you get my point though.

596
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:35,956
Speaker 1: Yeah Mercutio dies though.

597
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:37,520
Speaker 1: Maybe he doesn't even.

598
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:43,431
Speaker 1: You see what I did there.

599
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:46,385
Speaker 0: I see what you did there Actually, it's funny.

600
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:49,560
Speaker 1: Yeah part of the reason we thought about this was on the way to work.

601
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:58,100
Speaker 1: I was listening to movies you should see and they spoiled something in seven when they were reviewing seven Which was a good review because seven is still a great movie and I really like it.

602
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:02,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, seven is definitely a movie that's hard to spoil Not really.

603
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:06,360
Speaker 0: Ah, like you could tell what happens at the end, but it doesn't really ruin them experience.

604
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:07,712
Speaker 1: Oh, no, that's not what they spoiled.

605
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:08,700
Speaker 1: what they spoiled?

606
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:12,000
Speaker 1: Well, they kind of spoiled that but they spoiled one.

607
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:20,111
Speaker 1: There's a shock scene in during one of the murders Investigations, ah, I think you know which one I'm talking about I know what you talk about and they ruined it.

608
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:22,763
Speaker 1: and then they basically said oh, we'll bleep it out later Don't worry about it.

609
00:41:22,823 --> 00:41:25,895
Speaker 1: And I guess they forgot to ha ha so it's still in there.

610
00:41:25,915 --> 00:41:29,066
Speaker 0: Oh Fun time.

611
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:30,940
Speaker 1: yeah, luckily I've seen that movie twice.

612
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:32,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think.

613
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:42,820
Speaker 0: generally though what it all comes down to is if you're gonna Spoil things you need to like give a warning, you know That's all and then it's up to people whether they want to listen or not.

614
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,180
Speaker 0: And if they listen and they get it spoiled then it's their fault and you don't have to feel like you did anything bad.

615
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:55,315
Speaker 0: And that's what we do on the podcast and that's what I do in regular life Like oh is everyone I'll be like, hey has everyone here seen this?

616
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:56,440
Speaker 0: Okay, let's talk about it.

617
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,104
Speaker 1: Yep, and you know what?

618
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:58,653
Speaker 1: That's just basic social etiquette.

619
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:02,856
Speaker 0: Yeah but yeah spoiling is becoming a big problem.

620
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:11,593
Speaker 0: because Well to see more people are seeing more media and they're communicating with more people at once in a more public and more difficult to avoid.

621
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:20,502
Speaker 0: fashion and Information travels faster and more widely and et gets home, you know, yeah, it Marty McFly gets back to 1985.

622
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:38,080
Speaker 0: It's really hard to see all forms of art and experience them before Information about those works of art gets to your brain and on the internet It's getting to the point where there's no way to be careful other than not going to any websites.

623
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:45,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it even comes to things like not even works of art, but for example Like knowing the out.

624
00:42:45,123 --> 00:42:50,076
Speaker 0: like I we don't have television here and it's not possible to watch sporting events live.

625
00:42:50,216 --> 00:42:51,600
Speaker 0: very often Gandalf dies.

626
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:52,892
Speaker 0: yeah, so

627
00:42:53,194 --> 00:42:53,558
Speaker 1: when I

628
00:42:54,921 --> 00:43:06,660
Speaker 0: When a sports event happens, right and I want to watch that sports event perhaps, you know on a delayed video or something like that You know Like watch a Formula One race the next day on the train and I don't want to know who won.

629
00:43:07,182 --> 00:43:15,850
Speaker 0: I basically can't read the news or else I'll find out who won and I have to sort of not Take in any information watch it and then read the news.

630
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,076
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's kind of sucky.

631
00:43:18,437 --> 00:43:20,185
Speaker 0: It's really prohibitive I guess.

632
00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:22,000
Speaker 1: luckily this is kind of sad.

633
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,720
Speaker 1: But I think back and all the like all the media that I really would have cared about a spoiler.

634
00:43:27,243 --> 00:43:32,539
Speaker 1: I mean there are some things a lot of anime in a few movies that if someone has spoiled them I would have been incredibly angry.

635
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:38,360
Speaker 1: But I haven't seen anything in recent memory where having a spoiler or not having a spoiler would have mattered to me.

636
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:40,675
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I feel like I'm immune.

637
00:43:41,058 --> 00:43:45,822
Speaker 0: also I can't remember a time where something was spoiled for me like.

638
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:57,157
Speaker 0: I don't remember a single one I can and but also at the same time a lot of things have been spoiled like by myself because like the foreshadowing just tells me what to expect.

639
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:07,280
Speaker 1: and then You know and I see it you were the one bitching at me when we were watching Gundam seed because I kept predicting what was gonna happen based on the opening animation and I was always right.

640
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:11,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know you were right, but I also knew you were right cuz I had seen it.

641
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:18,040
Speaker 1: Yeah But the fact that you know the opener to that anime spoils all the plot except for one thing.

642
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,420
Speaker 0: But I was trying to do is I was trying to create the doubt to sort of prevent you from spoiling for you.

643
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:29,119
Speaker 1: Ah, but see much like my arguments in a lot of philosophical realms I cannot abide in cognitive dissonance.

644
00:44:29,602 --> 00:44:36,272
Speaker 1: So if I know something there is nothing in the world that can get me Even if I want to to pretend that I don't know it.

645
00:44:36,894 --> 00:44:38,220
Speaker 0: Well, that's just your problem.

646
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:41,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was actually I'm reading but I watch Gundam seed.

647
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:50,754
Speaker 0: I knew just as well as you did what all those openers alluding to but I purposefully said and it's just an opener They don't have to make the show the same as the ocean.

648
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:51,820
Speaker 1: I don't have that ability.

649
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,362
Speaker 1: It's funny cuz.

650
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:56,936
Speaker 0: actually it is true though that they could make the show different from the opener.

651
00:44:57,077 --> 00:45:00,137
Speaker 1: that never happens It could I don't think it's ever happened.

652
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:01,594
Speaker 0: I think.

653
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:05,151
Speaker 0: Oh Tana No, no, cuz you know horses.

654
00:45:06,115 --> 00:45:06,959
Speaker 0: Um horses.

655
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:13,275
Speaker 1: I win All right, so in shoujo kakumei Utena, which is one of my favorite anime series ever.

656
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:16,265
Speaker 1: Don't don't The movie's crap.

657
00:45:16,808 --> 00:45:30,379
Speaker 1: I just got to say that whenever I bring up this show But in the opener pretty much everything you see in the opener happens throughout the show and at the end of the opener there's the scene of the two main characters on armored horses wearing armor like flying up into the sky.

658
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:34,300
Speaker 1: and We had a friend whose name was dammit Dwayne.

659
00:45:34,944 --> 00:45:46,119
Speaker 1: Dammit Dwayne dammit Dwayne Dwayne like to smoke the pot a little bit to the watch to the point that None of his pot dealer friends would sell him pot because they thought he should stop smoking it.

660
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,443
Speaker 0: He had some problems.

661
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:51,856
Speaker 0: for anyone who says, you know marijuana doesn't hurt you marijuana blah marijuana this right?

662
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:53,020
Speaker 0: You're probably right.

663
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,771
Speaker 0: You know marijuana is probably not as bad as that smoking anything else.

664
00:45:56,912 --> 00:46:02,229
Speaker 1: I think the difference is benefits one joint per Week versus one joint per.

665
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:05,480
Speaker 1: yeah, I don't know if you mean oak marijuana in quantity.

666
00:46:05,621 --> 00:46:06,765
Speaker 0: I don't care what you say.

667
00:46:06,785 --> 00:46:09,615
Speaker 0: You will turn into a complete useless dumb.

668
00:46:09,656 --> 00:46:10,820
Speaker 1: It'll turn into dammit Dwayne.

669
00:46:10,961 --> 00:46:11,704
Speaker 1: Yeah who provide?

670
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:17,279
Speaker 1: he was the best dungeon master in the world for 20 minutes And then it all went downhill from there.

671
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,755
Speaker 1: But actually we heard he stopped smoking pot and he made something of himself.

672
00:46:22,056 --> 00:46:23,040
Speaker 0: We'll see how true that is.

673
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,586
Speaker 1: Yeah, how are we gonna find out?

674
00:46:24,606 --> 00:46:25,389
Speaker 1: I don't know.

675
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:26,494
Speaker 1: There's no way to find out.

676
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,940
Speaker 1: I've cut ties to all those people.

677
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:28,758
Speaker 0: I don't really care.

678
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:40,554
Speaker 1: But anyway This kid was convinced that that scene in the opener where they get on the horses and fly into the sky Was gonna be in the movie because he'd seen the whole show and it wasn't in the show.

679
00:46:40,975 --> 00:46:44,819
Speaker 1: and he knew because he's so much Smarter than everyone else that that's what was gonna happen in the movie.

680
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:51,136
Speaker 1: and He was so devastated when he saw the movie and that wasn't there like he cried.

681
00:46:51,457 --> 00:46:52,060
Speaker 1: He just lost it.

682
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:02,139
Speaker 0: That's not what I would cry over yeah, but that's what I figured the naked cars would have more of an effect But I don't know what kind of effect that was.

683
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:07,440
Speaker 1: Cuz at that point when the naked cars come on screen, you can't think what the hell you just kind of roll with it.

684
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,809
Speaker 1: At that point it was the weed crying.

685
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:12,807
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, so that's what we got to say about spoilers.

686
00:47:12,827 --> 00:47:16,417
Speaker 0: got anything else, uh, not particularly spoilers are on the internet.

687
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:32,601
Speaker 0: beware if a work of art can be spoiled so horribly that you know, there's no more enjoyment in it just because you know something then I Personally think that that work of art is inferior to say watchmen which can be spoiled but is enjoyable no matter how much you know About it.

688
00:47:33,003 --> 00:47:37,237
Speaker 1: I don't know if watchmen were if what happens in watchmen had been spoiled for me.

689
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:39,125
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it would suck I do not deny.

690
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:41,780
Speaker 0: but what I'm saying is that watchmen is superior.

691
00:47:42,143 --> 00:47:49,540
Speaker 0: Let's say there was a work of art It was spoiled right and now you could not enjoy it period or you enjoyed it significantly less.

692
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,949
Speaker 0: Watchmen in even if you know the spoiler.

693
00:47:53,170 --> 00:48:02,370
Speaker 0: sure that decreases the enjoyment of the first reading But it's still stupidly enjoyable every time and thus gets respect Whereas something else would get less respect.

694
00:48:02,873 --> 00:48:08,175
Speaker 1: and for a final spoiler I'm about to go play a bunch of counter-strike source because I kind of like it.

695
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:16,021
Speaker 0: now that I've finally played it I'm gonna go read that giant like 600 page gunsmith cats omnibus volume 2.

696
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:16,965
Speaker 1: So I'm holding out on that.

697
00:48:16,985 --> 00:48:17,969
Speaker 1: I got other things to read.

698
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:22,444
Speaker 0: Well, I also got gunsmith cats burst volume 1.

699
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:23,278
Speaker 0: It's kind of scary.

700
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:32,751
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

701
