1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:08,920
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:12,240
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, March 14th, 2012.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,761
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:13,523
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:15,289
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,891
Speaker 1: Tonight, the order of the stick.

7
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:24,234
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:33,580
Speaker 1: So, uh, this morning, I had a pleasant surprise.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,567
Speaker 1: I woke up, and who should be at my door?

10
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:38,011
Speaker 1: but BK?

11
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:41,099
Speaker 0: Uh, that's not a surprise.

12
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:41,821
Speaker 0: I checked the weather.

13
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:46,260
Speaker 0: I knew that there was smooth sailing, so the pirates would definitely be in town.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,901
Speaker 1: But I woke up late, so I thought, eh, maybe I shouldn't, uh, you know, my bike's not even ready.

15
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:51,082
Speaker 0: Why me?

16
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:53,053
Speaker 0: BK shows up at your door, you get on his boat.

17
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:54,440
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, what the fuck?

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,815
Speaker 0: If you don't do that, you're stuck at, like, the beginning of the game.

19
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:57,520
Speaker 0: You can't get anywhere.

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,778
Speaker 0: 'Cause my boat- Where you gonna get in life if you don't ride the pirate ship?

21
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:01,703
Speaker 1: My boat wasn't ready.

22
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:06,027
Speaker 0: You're never gonna get, you're never gonna see the Silver Sword shop, even if you had a thousand coins to buy.

23
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:08,016
Speaker 1: I actually, it took me a while.

24
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:11,872
Speaker 1: I had to, like, pump my tires up and do greasing and all this stuff to my bike.

25
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:13,177
Speaker 1: I did that in advance.

26
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:13,980
Speaker 1: I did not.

27
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,687
Speaker 0: 'Cause I checked the forecast.

28
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,936
Speaker 1: Ah, but I was busy burning characters.

29
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:18,980
Speaker 0: As a good sailor should.

30
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:27,706
Speaker 1: So we'll see, it's biking season, and, uh, Scott and I are actually in the, uh, like, New York Five Borough tour thing.

31
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,212
Speaker 0: It's not a race, it's a tour.

32
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:31,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, but people do- Like, little kids are in it and shit.

33
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,898
Speaker 1: Yeah, but people do treat it as a race, but they put those people in a group by themselves.

34
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:36,768
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's some people who can try to race.

35
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,100
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go as fast as I can, I'm gonna try to set a time.

36
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:40,504
Speaker 1: It's only, like, 40 miles.

37
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:41,647
Speaker 0: Like, it's not even that far.

38
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:43,492
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna go and go.

39
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:46,520
Speaker 1: I am gonna try to get a time lapse of the whole thing with the GoPro.

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,086
Speaker 0: Uh, I should try to do the same thing.

41
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:49,613
Speaker 1: Actually, you know what I'll do tomorrow morning?

42
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:50,900
Speaker 1: I'll get a time lapse of my commute.

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,589
Speaker 0: I'd do the same thing, but how are you gonna attach your GoPro to your bike?

44
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:57,800
Speaker 1: Uh, I have a thing that mounts it to my handlebars.

45
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,064
Speaker 0: You got these special extra handlebar mounts?

46
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like, it was like eight bucks.

47
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:06,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I noticed is I bought it and then they didn't come with that handlebar mount and I was like, "What the

48
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:06,980
Speaker 0: fuck?".

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,982
Speaker 1: Oh, so you bought it too?

50
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:11,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, "None of these fucking things will go on

51
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,871
Speaker 0: handlebars.".

52
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:15,639
Speaker 0: And they go on Amazon and I type it in and I'm like, "Oh, you make me buy an extra fucking thing, you piece of

53
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:15,739
Speaker 0: shit.".

54
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,214
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, like, I wanna try a time lapse with the handlebar and then a time lapse on the helmet to see which one, like, works better.

55
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:23,440
Speaker 0: The thing is, I don't even need to do a time lapse, I can just do a full lapse.

56
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,782
Speaker 1: I could do that too.

57
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:29,550
Speaker 1: But, who's gonna watch 25 minutes of me biking through Williamsburg?

58
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,553
Speaker 0: No, in post you speed it up, fast forward.

59
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:32,956
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what happens when you speed it up?

60
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:35,480
Speaker 1: It drops frames, so why even bother taking them?

61
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:36,502
Speaker 0: Why not?

62
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:43,797
Speaker 0: You can adjust in post and get it exactly the right length you want it to be, as opposed to pre-setting the length.

63
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:44,920
Speaker 0: and who knows what'll happen.

64
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,709
Speaker 1: Alright, you try that and I'm gonna do it the way I know, editing video.

65
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,237
Speaker 1: But with our powers combined now, we can do the 3D thing.

66
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,200
Speaker 1: once they release that.

67
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:54,983
Speaker 0: Uh, it's gonna be dumb.

68
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:58,310
Speaker 1: Well, it'll do real 3D, just do we wanna do real 3D or not?

69
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,071
Speaker 1: Do we need to?

70
00:02:59,091 --> 00:02:59,673
Speaker 1: No, it's dumb.

71
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:01,597
Speaker 1: How is it dumb?

72
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,220
Speaker 1: What if you wanna do, like, mocap or something?

73
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,602
Speaker 0: Nobody can watch it.

74
00:03:04,922 --> 00:03:06,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, they can, actually YouTube supports 3D.

75
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:10,830
Speaker 0: Nobody has the glasses in the shit to watch it.

76
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,474
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, the sad thing is, you forget because you're old.

77
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:17,900
Speaker 0: Except for when you go to PAX at the Nvidia booth and they have the little demo machine, no one has that shit.

78
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,967
Speaker 1: No, Scott, you forget because you're old, but punk kids who are into PC gaming seem to all have that.

79
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,670
Speaker 0: So an audience of like 10 dudes has that shit.

80
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,111
Speaker 1: Yeah.

81
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:32,820
Speaker 0: So it's worth it, we're gonna make a special video just for those 10 dudes who bought the crazy Nvidia goggles and have the right video card.

82
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,424
Speaker 1: We'll make one particular 3D video or two.

83
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:37,307
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, you know what it is?

84
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:38,389
Speaker 0: It's me giving you the finger.

85
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:39,691
Speaker 1: I just wanna try it out.

86
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,274
Speaker 0: 3D finger!

87
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,960
Speaker 0: I also wanna try stuff like, uh- You don't even have the goggles, you don't even know if it works!

88
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,994
Speaker 1: I also wanna try stuff like doing two cameras in the same event, like a lot of snowboarders putting one on their helmet and one on the snowboard looking back up at them.

89
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:53,915
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, that's necessary.

90
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,440
Speaker 1: So we can do stuff like that, we can, uh, lend and lease.

91
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,723
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, we're biking to work because it's warm out.

92
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:10,478
Speaker 1: And cons are coming up, so in the news, our friend Daryl Surratt is going, not to PAX, and not to Anime Boston- How could you not go to PAX?

93
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:11,940
Speaker 0: Nerd card revoked.

94
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,309
Speaker 1: And not to Anime Boston, where he is a fixture, but he's going to Sakura Con.

95
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,654
Speaker 0: Well, he's never been to Seattle, I mean, you know, trip to Seattle, not bad.

96
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,818
Speaker 1: But he could go to Seattle for PAX!

97
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,440
Speaker 0: That's when he should be going.

98
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,449
Speaker 1: Because I love Daryl, and we're super into anime, Daryl's super into anime, but Daryl is also super into gaming.

99
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,220
Speaker 1: But, uh, I do forgive him a little because the reason he's going is to see Kawajiri Yoshiaki.

100
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,281
Speaker 0: Well, that's his jam.

101
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:45,865
Speaker 1: That is his jam to a degree that I cannot fault him.

102
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:53,414
Speaker 1: Though, I would not skip PAX if Lincoln, Kennedy, Imhotep, and Jesus.

103
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:55,396
Speaker 0: Why would I skip PAX for any of those guys?

104
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,560
Speaker 0: I wouldn't even skip frickin' like Zenkai Con for any of those guys.

105
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,301
Speaker 1: I can't think of, really?

106
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:01,542
Speaker 1: You wouldn't defeat Imhotep?

107
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:02,963
Speaker 0: No?

108
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:03,564
Speaker 1: Why not?

109
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,965
Speaker 0: What would I say to Imhotep?

110
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:06,706
Speaker 1: How'd you build the fuckin' pyramids?

111
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:07,727
Speaker 0: And what would he say?

112
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:10,970
Speaker 1: I don't know, whatever he, however he fixed the pyramids.

113
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:19,857
Speaker 1: He wouldn't understand what I was saying to him, and he would probably say- Clearly, if there's a convention where they're all there, there's a moderator on the panel who speaks ancient Egyptian.

114
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:23,580
Speaker 0: Who on earth, currently living, speaks fluent ancient Egyptian?

115
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,221
Speaker 1: Imhotep.

116
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:28,686
Speaker 1: In this case, we've got Imhotep.

117
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,749
Speaker 0: And also speaks another human language.

118
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:37,535
Speaker 1: So I'm assuming that if they were able to fly Imhotep out, they have someone who can translate.

119
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:39,618
Speaker 1: Because otherwise, how did they convince him to come to the con?

120
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:41,340
Speaker 0: They did, and the museum just fuckin' kidnapped him.

121
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,622
Speaker 1: So, anyway.

122
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:46,224
Speaker 1: Besides, Jesus is fictional.

123
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,727
Speaker 1: You didn't harp on that, you harp on-.

124
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:56,340
Speaker 1: So, Kalajiri, if you didn't know, and you should know, you know, we haven't done a lot of anime shows lately, and when we have, we've just reviewed shows.

125
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,884
Speaker 1: But, uh, he is famous for anime that you shouldn't watch, but you probably should watch.

126
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:12,231
Speaker 1: Like, I don't know, Wicked City, or maybe Demon City, Cyber City Oedo, Vampire Hunter D, the new one, not the old one.

127
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:15,012
Speaker 1: Well, recently, I don't know if he did anything on the old one.

128
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:17,794
Speaker 1: I actually don't know much about the old one, now that I think about it.

129
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:20,036
Speaker 1: I feel bad about that, and wrong.

130
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:23,878
Speaker 1: But anyway, this is Daryl's jam, so I can see why he's going, but-

131
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:39,740
Speaker 0: It would cost him money to go to PAX, but this is free Seattle trip, so, you know, as I say, cost nothing, go to convention for your jam, or, I'd still go to PAX, but even if it cost all the money.

132
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:44,700
Speaker 1: You can tell there's not so much anime news lately.

133
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,503
Speaker 0: No, so, I'm gonna do a geek bite, because there's no news.

134
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:54,149
Speaker 0: So, I was trying to think of what comics I read recently, and really, I haven't read that many comics recently, although I've still been buying plenty of them.

135
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,433
Speaker 0: Mostly because I've been watching Running Man, but now that it's done, I'm reading again.

136
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:05,200
Speaker 0: So, anyway, I read Princess Knight by Tezuka, which is famous Tezuka shoujo manga.

137
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,542
Speaker 1: I have not read it yet, though I know the end.

138
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,604
Speaker 0: Did you know- I know how it ends.

139
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:10,805
Speaker 0: It's not a surprise.

140
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:11,125
Speaker 0: Yeah.

141
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,267
Speaker 0: Did you know it's only two volumes?

142
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:17,671
Speaker 1: Oh, uh, let me borrow it, like, now.

143
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:19,312
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's only two volumes, that's it.

144
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:20,133
Speaker 0: One, two, done.

145
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:21,394
Speaker 1: I guess I kind of had this impression.

146
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:22,114
Speaker 1: there was a lot of it.

147
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:27,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had a feeling- I also thought that it was a big, long manga, like Astro Boy with a bunch of volumes, but it's not.

148
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,780
Speaker 0: It's only two volumes, and that's it.

149
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,681
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

150
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:49,135
Speaker 0: Like, it's got a lot of cool stuff, it's got some cool characters, the pirate guy is the best, there's an awesome pirate, and also there's an evil witch, but the evil witch's daughter is actually kind of awesome, because there's this whole thing going on where, like, the evil witch wants the daughter to be an evil witch, but the daughter's like, "Eh, whatever, I don't really want to be an evil witch.

151
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:54,179
Speaker 0: Hey, my mom's making me do this evil witch shit, but come on, let's go and have fun or do whatever,".

152
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,900
Speaker 0: you know, she's pretty cool and awesome.

153
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:12,840
Speaker 0: The thing is, but it's not the best ever, it's not the best Tezuka, at least, not in my eyes, because the plot goes and goes and goes, and it's going a good direction, and then it sort of meanders a bit, like he doesn't know where to take it, and then he wraps it up.

154
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,942
Speaker 0: And that doesn't know where to take it.

155
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:21,591
Speaker 0: kind of wishy-washy part, about 70-80% of the way through is kind of, "Eh, what's going on here, alright,".

156
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:28,780
Speaker 0: you know, this kind of cool stuff, but it doesn't really, it's not in the same, it sort of gets you out of the flow that you had going with the beginning parts.

157
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,340
Speaker 0: But yeah, Princess Knight is Tezuka, it's excellent, and because it's only two volumes, you should buy that shit.

158
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,698
Speaker 0: So I suppose I will read it.

159
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,480
Speaker 0: It's also historically significant.

160
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:41,099
Speaker 1: And it'll give us a Wednesday show.

161
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:42,419
Speaker 0: Maybe.

162
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:42,940
Speaker 0: Maybe.

163
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:51,220
Speaker 0: If that's not redundant with the Geek Fight I just did, which was barely much of a Geek Fight at all, I just, you know, since it's only two volumes, what do you want me to say about it?

164
00:08:51,480 --> 00:09:01,840
Speaker 0: It's a story about this girl who, when she's born, right, God and all the angels, right, God's standing up there, and all the angels are like, "Alright, make sure you give the boy hearts to the boys and the girl hearts to the

165
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,040
Speaker 0: girls.".

166
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,219
Speaker 0: The angels are distributing the hearts.

167
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,820
Speaker 0: And one of them, by some circumstance, gets a boy heart and a girl heart.

168
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:10,280
Speaker 0: But it's a girl, but it has both hearts.

169
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,200
Speaker 0: So she's total badass, right?

170
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,680
Speaker 1: Because girls can't be badasses.

171
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,460
Speaker 0: Well, it's sort of sexist, and it's also not at the same time, right?

172
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:27,359
Speaker 0: Because on the one hand, it's like, "Okay, the boy heart makes you courageous and awesome at fighting and stuff like that, and the girl heart makes you pretty and beautiful and

173
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:27,700
Speaker 0: sweet.".

174
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,935
Speaker 0: And it's sort of like, "Alright, that part is

175
00:09:28,955 --> 00:09:29,239
Speaker 0: sexist.".

176
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,296
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it's like, "Well, they're both in this girl, so it's still giving you this girl who's also badass and kind of

177
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:36,597
Speaker 0: whatever.".

178
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:46,860
Speaker 0: But anyway, so she's like the princess, but totally pretending to be the prince so that she can be the king or whatever eventually.

179
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,500
Speaker 0: And of course, people try to find this out and uncover the secret so that other people can be the king instead, and all this sort of stuff.

180
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:03,500
Speaker 0: And then she meets boys, but then she's switching between being in a costume, dressing as a girl and dressing as a guy, and going in disguises.

181
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:13,300
Speaker 0: The guy she likes hates her when he thinks it's the prince, but is madly in love with her and thinks it's this beautiful girl who went to the dance, Cinderella-style.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,240
Speaker 0: That kind of stuff's going on, so that's what it's about.

183
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:18,478
Speaker 1: That's how that is.

184
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:29,299
Speaker 0: The angel, because he fucked up and gave two hearts to one person, he's coming down trying to correct the mistake, but it's like, "Well, you don't really want the mistake

185
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:29,720
Speaker 0: corrected.".

186
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of situations where she loses one heart and now she's all girly and she can't really fight, but then she has to fight because she's dressed as the prince and a guy shows up with a sword.

187
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:45,734
Speaker 0: And then maybe the heart switches back the other way, and now she's not girly anymore, so the guy wants to get with her, but she's like, "Whatever.

188
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:47,558
Speaker 0: I've got a boy heart now.

189
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:48,099
Speaker 0: I don't want

190
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:48,239
Speaker 0: you.".

191
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,159
Speaker 1: I feel like this would be very different if it was, instead of hearts, it was genitalia.

192
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:54,062
Speaker 0: Yeah.

193
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,460
Speaker 0: Pretty sure she has the girl genitalia the whole time.

194
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:58,100
Speaker 0: Pretty sure?

195
00:10:58,361 --> 00:10:59,185
Speaker 0: Yeah.

196
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:01,939
Speaker 0: There's a lot of Rose of Versailles going on.

197
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,633
Speaker 1: So, things of the day.

198
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,557
Speaker 1: This is pretty great.

199
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:24,530
Speaker 1: Way greater than you would expect a video like this to be, and all I want to say is it's funny right away, but if you wait for it, it is amazing.

200
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,543
Speaker 0: Yeah, just watch this whole video and just don't get bored and try to fast-forward or anything like that.

201
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,887
Speaker 0: Just wait for the payoff.

202
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:32,090
Speaker 0: Trust me, there is a payoff.

203
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,432
Speaker 1: Well, I'll bet you some money.

204
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:38,519
Speaker 1: I will bet you all that it is impossible to not start laughing.

205
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,150
Speaker 1: There is no way you can watch this video and make it past the 40-second mark without laughing out loud at least a little bit.

206
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,700
Speaker 0: Unless you're a dupe.

207
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:50,730
Speaker 1: What?

208
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,801
Speaker 0: I just tried to combine doofus and derp, so maybe a derpus.

209
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:56,703
Speaker 0: I don't know what I said.

210
00:11:57,564 --> 00:11:58,086
Speaker 0: It's recorded.

211
00:11:58,106 --> 00:11:58,827
Speaker 0: You can go hear what I said.

212
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,168
Speaker 0: Some new word.

213
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,977
Speaker 1: When I was a really little kid, I remember I was mad at my little brother.

214
00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:04,678
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

215
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:06,922
Speaker 1: I have no idea what I was mad about.

216
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:11,610
Speaker 1: So, I wanted to call him a scumbucket, but I kind of also wanted to call him a scum-sucker.

217
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:19,390
Speaker 1: And I said scumbucker, which sounded like scum-fucker, and I got sent to my room for saying fuck.

218
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:23,140
Speaker 0: So, in first grade, I don't know if I told this story, right?

219
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,590
Speaker 0: You know, I knew some bad words, but I didn't know all the bad words.

220
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:32,110
Speaker 1: Every kid had a repertoire, like you collected them, like you had this little folder of bad words in the brain.

221
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,315
Speaker 0: Didn't know all the bad words, though, right?

222
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:40,330
Speaker 0: So, you know, sitting in the back of the room, having a discussion about bad words with some of the kids.

223
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,708
Speaker 1: When children share gnosis.

224
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:44,340
Speaker 0: Alright, and this kid's like, "Hey, you know that bad word?

225
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,830
Speaker 0: It's like itch, but there's a B in front of

226
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:46,930
Speaker 0: it.".

227
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,536
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Bitch?

228
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:48,061
Speaker 0: That's not even a

229
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:48,424
Speaker 0: word."

230
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:50,112
Speaker 0: Right?

231
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:53,082
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Well, there's also, there's another one.

232
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:53,604
Speaker 0: It's duck.

233
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:54,809
Speaker 0: You replace the D with an

234
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:54,849
Speaker 0: F.".

235
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:55,893
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Fuck?

236
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:58,282
Speaker 0: Fuck is absolutely not a word.

237
00:12:58,302 --> 00:12:59,848
Speaker 0: There is no way that that's a

238
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:00,189
Speaker 0: word.".

239
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,583
Speaker 1: Wait, so what bad words did you know?

240
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:03,650
Speaker 1: Like pee-pee and doo-doo?

241
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:04,815
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

242
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:07,310
Speaker 0: All I knew is that I didn't believe that those were real words.

243
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:09,878
Speaker 0: So then, you know, the teacher's like, "What are you

244
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:10,199
Speaker 0: saying?".

245
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:13,750
Speaker 0: I'm like, you know, the teacher thought I was just trying to get away with saying the words.

246
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,274
Speaker 0: But I was like, "No, really.

247
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,318
Speaker 0: Fuck is not a word.

248
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,883
Speaker 0: There is no way that that's a word.

249
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:18,305
Speaker 0: It's not in the

250
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:18,907
Speaker 0: dictionary.".

251
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,113
Speaker 0: I actually went and got the dictionary.

252
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,216
Speaker 0: I was like, "Look, it's not in here.

253
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:24,161
Speaker 0: It's not a word.

254
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:26,286
Speaker 0: Fuck is not a word.

255
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:26,527
Speaker 0: This is

256
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:27,008
Speaker 0: bullshit.".

257
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,550
Speaker 1: I'm glad that our society is rapidly getting past that.

258
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,396
Speaker 0: Yeah, no kidding.

259
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:33,790
Speaker 0: Anyway.

260
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:42,990
Speaker 1: And of course, in the meta moment, we are going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo and Anime Boston, but mostly the Penny Arcade Expo.

261
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,594
Speaker 0: Do we even have to say this?

262
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:48,528
Speaker 0: We're going to be at every Penny Arcade Expo that ever happens, ever, unless we are dead.

263
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,848
Speaker 1: Unless we die or it ends.

264
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,384
Speaker 0: Or unless somehow we are banned from it or something like that weird crazy happens.

265
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:56,330
Speaker 0: or there is something even more important.

266
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,072
Speaker 1: You know what?

267
00:13:57,093 --> 00:14:02,029
Speaker 1: I posit that we could not get banned because after that late show, they did not ban us.

268
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:03,574
Speaker 0: Something could happen.

269
00:14:03,614 --> 00:14:08,670
Speaker 0: For example, I could be offered a free trip into outer space that happens to be on the same day as PAX.

270
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,204
Speaker 1: Would you take outer space over PAX Prime?

271
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,530
Speaker 1: Not East, but Prime.

272
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,096
Speaker 1: So the line is space.

273
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,240
Speaker 0: I mean, it would take a lot, but it's possible, right?

274
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,486
Speaker 0: There are things that...

275
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,153
Speaker 1: Alright, so here's the question.

276
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:26,609
Speaker 1: Would you at least contact the space guy and say, "Hey, can you wait a

277
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:26,809
Speaker 1: week?"?

278
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,156
Speaker 0: I would ask, sure.

279
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,570
Speaker 0: But you know, launches, they tend not to move.

280
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:43,530
Speaker 0: Or maybe I get a horrible disease and I'm not dead yet, but if I don't get this treatment instead of PAX and the treatment's only available somewhere far away from PAX, then I'll die.

281
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,309
Speaker 0: But if I get the treatment, I'll live.

282
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:54,890
Speaker 1: That is a nice game theory conundrum there because you'd miss one PAX, but get more than one PAX worth compared to dying.

283
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:00,005
Speaker 0: Of course, even with the treatment, if I wasn't going to live to the next PAX, I'd just go to the PAX and die.

284
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,550
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously.

285
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,608
Speaker 1: Scott was the one who famously said in our forum, "I would skip my own wedding for

286
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:05,850
Speaker 1: PAX.".

287
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:12,110
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, if the person wasn't okay with that, I wouldn't be marrying them, right?

288
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,216
Speaker 1: But yes, we will be there.

289
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:17,230
Speaker 1: We are doing a Let's Play money-making game.

290
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:29,530
Speaker 1: We are doing the Geek Nights tabletop workshop, where over the course of two hours we will teach the entire audience in the tabletop workshop room, which is a classroom with tons of seats and tables in the audience.

291
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,480
Speaker 1: We're going to teach Agricola and Carcassonne and a third secret game.

292
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:35,684
Speaker 1: Spot it.

293
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:36,746
Speaker 1: Probably.

294
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,190
Speaker 1: I haven't decided yet.

295
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,609
Speaker 0: Oh, let's play the trigger game before I go.

296
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,051
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

297
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,930
Speaker 1: We will also be doing a whole bunch of other stuff at PAX along with all of our friends.

298
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:47,880
Speaker 1: We will have a schedule of the good stuff to go to.

299
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:51,390
Speaker 1: Meaning, our stuff, Luke Crane's stuff, Jared Sorensen's stuff.

300
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,450
Speaker 0: The stuff that we approve of and is done by our friends.

301
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,910
Speaker 1: Yep, Lorian Green's screening of Going Cardboard, which I haven't watched yet.

302
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,486
Speaker 1: Which we're in.

303
00:15:58,251 --> 00:15:58,657
Speaker 1: I have it.

304
00:15:58,739 --> 00:15:59,390
Speaker 1: It's sitting right here.

305
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,029
Speaker 0: It is a documentary about board games and we are in it.

306
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,698
Speaker 1: So is Rainer Canizia.

307
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:05,387
Speaker 1: Therefore, we are...

308
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,821
Speaker 0: We probably shouldn't be featured in it as much as we are, but we are.

309
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:11,330
Speaker 0: And two of the special features are mostly us.

310
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:15,870
Speaker 1: You know, I didn't think it'd be this early in my life where I was a special feature on a DVD.

311
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:16,654
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,150
Speaker 1: Move the GloW to the menu item to open the special feature of the DVD.

313
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:24,679
Speaker 0: I guess to at least put us down a notch.

314
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,870
Speaker 0: It's not a DVD they sell in Best Buy, right?

315
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,166
Speaker 0: Yet.

316
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:27,868
Speaker 0: Yeah.

317
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:29,735
Speaker 1: Best Buy.

318
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,950
Speaker 1: I haven't been inside of a Best Buy in years.

319
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,750
Speaker 0: I've been to some of the Manhattan ones while waiting to do something because I happen to be.

320
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,274
Speaker 0: I was like, "I'm standing on the street.

321
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:43,085
Speaker 0: I have to be somewhere in 15 minutes, but where I have to be is right next to me.

322
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:44,389
Speaker 0: What am I going to do for 15

323
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,629
Speaker 0: minutes?".

324
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:46,199
Speaker 0: There's a Best Buy here.

325
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:47,790
Speaker 0: And there's nothing else here.

326
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,869
Speaker 0: Alright, let's go inside.

327
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:49,790
Speaker 0: So yeah.

328
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,030
Speaker 0: And let's walk out without buying anything.

329
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,737
Speaker 1: Anyway, we will be at PAX and Anime Boston.

330
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,205
Speaker 1: Anime Boston, we're doing one, two, or three panels.

331
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:57,750
Speaker 1: I gotta check my scheduling and all that.

332
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:05,369
Speaker 1: But anyway, the book club book, which we'll do a show on announcing shortly, will be The Hunger Games because everyone's making a big ruckus about it.

333
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:15,230
Speaker 1: I read enough to realize that it's not... I started reading it thinking it was going to be a bad book and I was going to make fun of all my friends for recommending some kid's book.

334
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,584
Speaker 1: But now, it's pretty good.

335
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,150
Speaker 1: Pretty 1984.

336
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,949
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll still end up making fun of it.

337
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:19,527
Speaker 0: You may.

338
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,848
Speaker 0: It could be a Firefly situation.

339
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,051
Speaker 1: But it was pretty good.

340
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,743
Speaker 1: I don't think you'll dislike it.

341
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,609
Speaker 1: Unless you want to dislike it.

342
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:28,698
Speaker 0: I don't, you know.

343
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:29,749
Speaker 0: I just go into it.

344
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,688
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

345
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:35,301
Speaker 1: All that aside, this Friday, there's a NerdNYC board game night.

346
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:37,810
Speaker 1: We've missed several between me going to India and conventions.

347
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,389
Speaker 0: I went to the last one.

348
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:39,670
Speaker 1: I've missed several.

349
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,324
Speaker 0: Well, I missed... They had some bonus ones lately.

350
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:43,430
Speaker 0: Like, there was one on a Tuesday.

351
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:45,750
Speaker 1: I would have gone, except I had stuff to do.

352
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,742
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did not go to any bonus ones.

353
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:48,789
Speaker 0: I only went to regular ones.

354
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:51,350
Speaker 1: Trouble is, it's bike season.

355
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,994
Speaker 0: Yep.

356
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,546
Speaker 0: Also...

357
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,450
Speaker 1: I can't leave my bike at the NerdNYC night unless I ride my shitty bike to work.

358
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,421
Speaker 0: I just ride my bike home, then go to NerdNYC?

359
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,010
Speaker 0: Or not ride my bike that day.

360
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,195
Speaker 1: Ah, but I want to ride my bike.

361
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:04,630
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to ride my shitty bike to work on Friday morning if it doesn't rain.

362
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:10,470
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, you should also remember, the internets exist, and we are on the internets.

363
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:33,490
Speaker 0: So if you Facebook, Google+, Twitter, iTunes, websites, anything like that, you can follow, subscribe, join, grab... whatever, us, and get our stuffs, and hook up with us in a social way, and follow our shit, and you'll be notified about all our goings on, internet-wise.

364
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:35,169
Speaker 1: Most of them are pretty good.

365
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:36,735
Speaker 1: Yeah.

366
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:37,328
Speaker 1: Most of them.

367
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:37,782
Speaker 0: Most.

368
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:47,163
Speaker 1: So, way back around 2003, which was a decade ago, almost, we discovered, and...

369
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:55,410
Speaker 0: had already died, but there were some other ones.

370
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,850
Speaker 1: I think that might have been before, when it came back and died again, though.

371
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:01,769
Speaker 0: No, because it was all freshman year.

372
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:05,330
Speaker 1: No, it was sophomore year, some of it, because we were in Colony.

373
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,720
Speaker 1: I will look it up, old man, with your Alzheimer's.

374
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,430
Speaker 1: Introduce Order of the Stick while I look this up and prove your Alzheimer's.

375
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,410
Speaker 0: So, you know, we played the D&Ds in those days, because you didn't know better, and there was no better in those days.

376
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,736
Speaker 1: I know, we had not yet met Luke Crane.

377
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:31,729
Speaker 1: I knew the alternatives to D&D were, like, Shadowrun, Palladium Books, Call of Cthulhu, White Wolf, Legend of the Five Rings, Rifts, 7C, and older versions of Dungeons and Dragons.

378
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,609
Speaker 1: I said Legend of the Five Rings.

379
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:34,874
Speaker 0: Oh.

380
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:38,770
Speaker 0: The thing is, you said Legend of the Five Rings, I said L5R, so it didn't match up.

381
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,049
Speaker 1: I remember D20, there was a bunch of D20 stuff, like Star Wars D20, Cthulhu D20.

382
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:45,130
Speaker 0: Right, anyway.

383
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:45,970
Speaker 1: Old paranoia.

384
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,673
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, paranoia, true.

385
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:58,805
Speaker 0: Okay, so anyway, we played D&D, and, you know, D&D jokes are funny, like jokes about rolling D20s, and, you know, casting Magic Missile at the Darkness, and all those types of jokes.

386
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:00,030
Speaker 0: They were good jokes.

387
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:08,730
Speaker 1: I mean, very often- Very often you would say something like, "Guess he didn't make his saving throw against flatulence," or whatever the issue was.

388
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,659
Speaker 0: Jesus saves, and takes half damage.

389
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:12,642
Speaker 0: Classic.

390
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:18,674
Speaker 1: Alright, so- The Boys of Guter Science was dead in 2003.

391
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:19,108
Speaker 0: I told you.

392
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:31,310
Speaker 1: But it went through summer of 2002, where we were not in fact freshmen at RIT, and where we were in fact living in colony.

393
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:33,338
Speaker 0: Oh, whatever.

394
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,558
Speaker 1: Anyway, so- So you were all- you're an old man, you're wrong.

395
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:41,015
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read these VVOCSs while you- That's a good idea.

396
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:42,642
Speaker 0: Not you too, Tribes 2.

397
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,250
Speaker 0: Alright, anyway.

398
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:47,410
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I remember every one of these strips.

399
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,259
Speaker 0: Of course you do.

400
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:48,949
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't you?

401
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,110
Speaker 0: So, in the webcomic heyday, right, one of our friends discovered this webcomic called Order of the Stig.

402
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:04,950
Speaker 0: So he told us about it, we started reading it, and it was basically- it started out as just this party of adventurers, you know, pretty typical, the big fighter leader guy, but he was also smart, so he wasn't so stereotypical.

403
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,218
Speaker 0: The thiefy girl, all rogue you like.

404
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,967
Speaker 0: The stupid bard, as opposed to the spoonie bard.

405
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:11,769
Speaker 0: Well, he's also spoonie.

406
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:21,448
Speaker 0: You know, the really stereotypical Thor dwarf cleric guy, and the evil hobbit kind of guy.

407
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:22,530
Speaker 0: Halfling, whatever.

408
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,870
Speaker 0: Oh, and then the elf wizard, who is sort of androgynous.

409
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, they made a big deal- that was like one of the running gags was, "Well, is it a man or a

410
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:31,270
Speaker 1: woman?".

411
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:33,050
Speaker 0: They haven't really answered that either.

412
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:34,108
Speaker 1: It's obviously a man.

413
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,250
Speaker 0: And the spouse is also androgynous.

414
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,170
Speaker 1: Obviously a woman.

415
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:38,745
Speaker 0: Anyway, well, former spouse.

416
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:39,290
Speaker 0: Oh, spoilers.

417
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:44,784
Speaker 0: Anyway, so they're adventuring, not really for any particular reason.

418
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:46,290
Speaker 0: so much, at least not that I can remember.

419
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:55,609
Speaker 0: And basically the whole comic just starts out with this sort of, you know, not the greatest artwork, you know, pretty much circle heads, and I almost could draw it if I put enough effort into it.

420
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:59,054
Speaker 0: And making all the D&D jokes in the world.

421
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:09,367
Speaker 1: Jokes about flumps, jokes about- Jokes about the conversion from second ed to third ed.

422
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:10,689
Speaker 0: Oh my.

423
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:23,230
Speaker 0: Second one- So pretty much when we got to RIT is when third ed came out, so this, you know- Fail listen check joke, singing to tell a guy to jump over the pit, and then singing to bluff- Jump, jump, jump over the pit.

424
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,670
Speaker 1: Bluff, bluff, bluff the stupid ogre.

425
00:22:25,652 --> 00:22:27,289
Speaker 0: Bluff, bluff, bluff the stupid ogre.

426
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,869
Speaker 0: You got the banjo the clown, you know, deity jokes.

427
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,610
Speaker 1: My favorite spell in all of newer D&D, Expeditious Retreat.

428
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,167
Speaker 0: Ah, I forgot about that one until just now.

429
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:37,590
Speaker 0: Excellent.

430
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,350
Speaker 0: It's a good spell.

431
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:39,112
Speaker 0: It is.

432
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:42,190
Speaker 0: So, telling D&D jokes pretty much with web comics.

433
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,330
Speaker 0: But then, as time went on, you know, of course it starts out with boring dungeoning.

434
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,829
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, not boring dungeoning, just silly dungeoning.

435
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,530
Speaker 0: And, you know, there's an awesome bad guy, Zykon the Lich.

436
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:59,169
Speaker 0: Can't do better than the Lich, especially since he's awesome with his skull head and his phylactery and his robes and his- Ah yeah, Zykon is the best.

437
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,430
Speaker 0: So, you know, they're fighting the Zykon or whatever.

438
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,864
Speaker 0: And then, over time, he's like, "Well, we sort of finished this dungeon.

439
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:08,329
Speaker 0: Let's start to build a plot

440
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:08,570
Speaker 0: here.".

441
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,349
Speaker 0: And he starts to build up this plot going on.

442
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:15,030
Speaker 0: And he just kept going with it and getting it bigger and bigger and bigger.

443
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:18,470
Speaker 0: And it rolled up into something kind of epic and awesome.

444
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:25,290
Speaker 0: And he managed to somehow continue to tell D&D jokes while also keeping the plot going.

445
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,810
Speaker 0: While also having the strong characters.

446
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:35,150
Speaker 0: So then, in addition to the D&D jokes, it also has its own humor, just character humor.

447
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:41,270
Speaker 0: And I didn't realize how popular it was until he just kickstarted for like a zillion dollars.

448
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's one of those things where you're not gonna see a lot of- like, people don't cosplay that much as it.

449
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:51,350
Speaker 0: I've never really- I've never seen or ordered this to cosplay in my life, but now I'm cosplaying Zykon.

450
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,270
Speaker 1: I don't see mashups, you know, it's one of those things that's just solidly popular.

451
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:59,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, you never see, like, a thread in the forum about it or anything like that, right?

452
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:07,510
Speaker 0: But- Rich Berlew never- he never did, like, the kind of publicity stuff- He would have long hiatuses where he wouldn't put out too many comics that frequently.

453
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,010
Speaker 0: You know, I met him once, he was kinda shy, whatever.

454
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,450
Speaker 1: Like, in the whole webcomic boom, he always felt very tangential to it.

455
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,950
Speaker 1: Like, he was making a solid comic, but he wasn't involved in all the drama of the webcomic world.

456
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:26,930
Speaker 0: He wasn't one of the major webcomics, like Penny Arcade and PVP and, you know, even the ones that people hate so much.

457
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:34,990
Speaker 0: Like, Control Delete or, you know, Questionable Content or Aqua- you know, all the big- you know, Mega Tokyo, all the big webcomics.

458
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,330
Speaker 0: The ones that come out swinging and, you know, the ones that people think of, good or bad, right?

459
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,540
Speaker 0: He was just sorta like, "Successful webcomic.

460
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:42,584
Speaker 0: People read it.

461
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:43,428
Speaker 0: It's off to the

462
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:43,810
Speaker 0: side.".

463
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:50,730
Speaker 0: You know, but it's not one that comes to mind when you talk- you know, if you're gonna do a documentary on webcomics, now you'd put him in there.

464
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,010
Speaker 0: But if you were making this documentary, like, three years ago, maybe you wouldn't put him in there, you know?

465
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,570
Speaker 0: You'd have to, like, go hunting around, maybe, or be really in the know.

466
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:00,890
Speaker 0: But I guess not, because I guess it's really popular.

467
00:25:02,491 --> 00:25:08,730
Speaker 0: So, in addition to the webcomic that he did- he's still doing- he also, you know, printed the whole webcomic in books.

468
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,830
Speaker 0: And he even printed up, like, whole books of stuff that isn't online.

469
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:19,790
Speaker 0: Like, these prequel books, like, volume minus one, volume minus two, volume D. Like, they're not on the internets, as far as I know.

470
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,930
Speaker 0: I mean, they might be pirated on the internets, but they're not, you know, on his website, you know, except for the purchase link.

471
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:26,698
Speaker 0: Which is a pretty interesting thing.

472
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,630
Speaker 0: Like, if Penny Arcade did that, how awesome would that be?

473
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,950
Speaker 0: Like, hey, he has, like, 50 Penny Arcade strips in a book that aren't on the internets.

474
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,442
Speaker 0: I'd be like, "Oh my god, pre-order all the

475
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:36,607
Speaker 0: copies!".

476
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:39,216
Speaker 0: Anyway.

477
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:42,930
Speaker 0: So yeah, so he Kickstarted, because, you know, he didn't really have that much money from this, I guess.

478
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:46,830
Speaker 0: You know, other than the book sales, you know, which I think were steady.

479
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,750
Speaker 0: But he sort of sold out of all the books, and he wanted to keep them all in print, so that anyone who wanted one could get them.

480
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,950
Speaker 0: Because only a few of them were in print.

481
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:59,070
Speaker 0: So he put the Kickstarter out there, and somehow the Kickstarter *usploded* a bajillion dollars.

482
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,280
Speaker 1: Now, it's very telling that this is a comic that grew out of, basically, making fun of D&D.

483
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:12,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, D&D jokes only get you so far.

484
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,790
Speaker 0: It's like, how many times can you tell the same joke about, you know, saving throws or Mage Hand?

485
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:22,210
Speaker 1: But the fact that those jokes are still there, in this plot, I still enjoy it.

486
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,890
Speaker 1: And I know a lot of people who never played a lot of D&D who found this comic hilarious.

487
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:35,850
Speaker 0: Well, he does a good job of making the jokes still be D&D roleplaying jokes, without having them to be so specific to any particular rule system that you won't get them, right?

488
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:41,990
Speaker 0: So it's like, you can still get them even if you just understand the general idea of D&D, and sort of like the basics.

489
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,270
Speaker 0: You know?

490
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:51,910
Speaker 0: That, hey, bard sings songs, and, you know, when a bard sings a song, it has a magical power that influences people and helps them.

491
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,332
Speaker 0: You know, gives them boosts.

492
00:26:53,393 --> 00:27:00,310
Speaker 0: You don't need to know the specific rule that, like, bard's song gives +1 to your skill roll, whatever it is.

493
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:01,690
Speaker 0: Anyway.

494
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,889
Speaker 1: So, uh, I mean, what else, what can I say, really?

495
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:10,505
Speaker 0: Uh, I guess we can talk about some of the awesome stuff that's in it.

496
00:27:10,827 --> 00:27:11,389
Speaker 0: Particulars.

497
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,069
Speaker 1: Well, you just want to talk about Zykon.

498
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:14,889
Speaker 0: Uh, I was about to talk about Zykon.

499
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we'll try to- Let's talk about someone besides Zykon.

500
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,230
Speaker 1: We'll try to not spoil a lot, because, really, you should read this.

501
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,060
Speaker 1: If you're at all into comics, forget webcomics.

502
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,670
Speaker 1: This is just a comic that happens to be on the web.

503
00:27:28,677 --> 00:27:31,450
Speaker 0: Uh, let's see, what part of this deck can we talk about?

504
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,919
Speaker 1: I guess we could spoil.

505
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,250
Speaker 1: Go past the spoiler line.

506
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,411
Speaker 0: I don't know.

507
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:36,012
Speaker 0: Whatever.

508
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:44,490
Speaker 0: So, the basic idea is that, you know, at least the characters believe, and the reader believes, there's some sort of impending doom, right, against the world.

509
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:52,130
Speaker 0: That in the olden days, the really strong magic dudes, sort of, you know, there was a horrible monster that sort of ruined, you know, that was going to destroy the whole world.

510
00:27:52,751 --> 00:27:59,230
Speaker 0: And the, uh, the really powerful historical dudes from the way past managed to seal it up, right?

511
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:06,490
Speaker 0: And they're like, for these, they're like these gates into the other dimension that it could come through, but the gates are sealed, so the world is safe, right?

512
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:27,750
Speaker 0: But, that first dungeon they were in, in the whole story, and also some of the subsequent places, were at these gates, and, you know, Zykon and whoever wants these items of power, because everyone has different beliefs about exactly what the deal is, like, you know, some horrible spell you can cast at the gate to get powerful, or do evil, or whatever, or maybe do good.

513
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,697
Speaker 0: So, it's like the good guys want to keep the gates sealed, and the bad guys want to open it.

514
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:37,909
Speaker 0: It's actually kind of similar to Golden Sun, where like the towers, where at first it's like the good guys are like, "No, we can't let the bad guys fuck with the

515
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:38,250
Speaker 0: towers.".

516
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,785
Speaker 0: And then it's like, "Alright, let's just go fuck with all the towers now, and see what

517
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,066
Speaker 0: happens.".

518
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,634
Speaker 0: Yeah.

519
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:49,084
Speaker 0: But, you know, they don't want to let, you know, the evil thing get in and destroy the whole world.

520
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:51,630
Speaker 0: They want to keep, you know, the thing sealed out and whatever.

521
00:28:51,870 --> 00:29:02,107
Speaker 0: And in the course of doing this, they travel all over the world, and characters sort out their personal dramas, and you discover all sorts of, you know, "Oh, that was really that!

522
00:29:02,328 --> 00:29:02,488
Speaker 0: Oh,

523
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:03,129
Speaker 0: snap!".

524
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:03,830
Speaker 1: kind of stuff.

525
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,200
Speaker 1: Well, I think what really what I like about the comic is that, one, it's clever.

526
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,630
Speaker 1: Like, it's cleverly written, the writing's good, the dialogue's good, the characters are good.

527
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:24,970
Speaker 1: But specifically, the characters are very deeply fleshed out, and actually react in interesting enough ways to where I'll actually put up with similar jokes being repeated, just because the characters themselves are kind of existing in this space and progressing through their shit.

528
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has that strong character thing I like.

529
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:32,969
Speaker 0: You know, like a lot of animes and stuff, or, you know, like superhero comics, it's like, "Okay, you have this guy, and who is

530
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:33,089
Speaker 0: he?".

531
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:35,085
Speaker 0: We talked about this a lot in DC 52, right?

532
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Legion of Superheroes.

533
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:38,160
Speaker 1: They're just a bunch of stereotypes.

534
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,857
Speaker 0: Well, there were two guys that weren't stereotypes.

535
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:44,550
Speaker 0: The really smart guy, the brainiac guy, and then the other guy, right?

536
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,167
Speaker 0: And everyone else was just a costume that said something, and didn't have any character to them.

537
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,030
Speaker 0: They didn't have a personality.

538
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:56,010
Speaker 0: All the order to stick characters, even side characters, and villains, and all kinds, they all have personalities.

539
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:05,710
Speaker 0: And the thing is, he's not afraid to change the personalities either, and the thing is, he doesn't so much change them, but he has this clever- Evolve them.

540
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,994
Speaker 0: Right, he'll evolve them or reveal them.

541
00:30:08,054 --> 00:30:11,040
Speaker 0: It's like, "Okay, this guy hasn't really had a personality.

542
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:15,849
Speaker 0: Let's do a reveal, like, oh, he's actually been up to something this whole

543
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:16,470
Speaker 0: time!".

544
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:25,110
Speaker 0: So now you can retroactively apply that personality so it all makes sense, as opposed to the character didn't suddenly, you know, change their mind.

545
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:34,010
Speaker 0: It's just, they were acting that way because, and now they're acting, you know, and now since they're revealed to the reader, you know, now you get to see them acting the way they really act.

546
00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:37,761
Speaker 0: And the character has suddenly changed, even though plot-wise they didn't change.

547
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,590
Speaker 0: You're just being able to see the character, whereas before it was hidden.

548
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:57,989
Speaker 1: Now the final thing that really, I think, draws me to the comic is that, and I don't know if it's a side effect of Berloo's storytelling, or just a side effect of the fact that this is a story built in a world that follows Dungeons & Dragons rules directly, and specifically, and explicitly, but-

549
00:30:59,034 --> 00:30:59,949
Speaker 0: We didn't do things of the day.

550
00:31:00,332 --> 00:31:01,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.

551
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:02,208
Speaker 0: I didn't.

552
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,318
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess you didn't.

553
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,289
Speaker 1: Oh well, you missed it.

554
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:04,761
Speaker 0: Oh well.

555
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:11,369
Speaker 0: So- I'm sitting here looking at my thing of the day and I'm like, I didn't talk about this.

556
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,419
Speaker 0: Okay, so this thing of the day is actually, is actually a really good thing of the day.

557
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:29,619
Speaker 0: So it's a shame if I would have had to skip it, but I guess we'll just throw it in here for LOLs.

558
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,433
Speaker 0: So, Where the Wild Things Are, it's a book.

559
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:33,540
Speaker 0: It's a good book.

560
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,157
Speaker 1: Great book.

561
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:34,678
Speaker 1: Good.

562
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,880
Speaker 1: There's an animated version.

563
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,440
Speaker 0: Yep, there's a live action movie, which I haven't seen.

564
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, I heard it was good.

565
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:40,075
Speaker 0: I don't know.

566
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:44,055
Speaker 0: But anyway, here is on YouTube a reading of the book.

567
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:45,440
Speaker 0: It's about 10 minutes long.

568
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:48,680
Speaker 0: It is read by Christopher Walken.

569
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:53,760
Speaker 0: And because it's a short book, he sort of has to elaborate and he describes all the pictures and all kinds of stuff.

570
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:58,440
Speaker 0: And while he's reading it, of course the YouTube video is showing you the pages.

571
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,511
Speaker 0: And that's about it.

572
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:02,980
Speaker 0: It's the awesomest.

573
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,860
Speaker 1: You don't want to say?

574
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,310
Speaker 0: It's Christopher Walken reading.

575
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,639
Speaker 0: The Wild Things Are.

576
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,120
Speaker 1: Christopher Walken.

577
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,119
Speaker 0: There's not really much else into it.

578
00:32:11,122 --> 00:32:12,279
Speaker 0: That's all you need.

579
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:15,680
Speaker 0: And he keeps calling Max a jerk.

580
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,266
Speaker 0: He's like,

581
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:16,530
Speaker 0: "What?".

582
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:18,905
Speaker 0: And he's like, "What's he doing?

583
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:21,397
Speaker 0: beating that beast over the head with his king

584
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:21,678
Speaker 0: stick?".

585
00:32:22,829 --> 00:32:23,020
Speaker 0: Anyway.

586
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:38,420
Speaker 1: So anyway, but because the world is so kind of deeply entwined in these very specific rules, the writing is such that every tiny little detail is perfectly cross-referenced with every other detail.

587
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,120
Speaker 1: Superhero Comics has got nothing on the continuity of the Order of the Stick.

588
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:42,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

589
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:43,960
Speaker 0: It has extreme continuity.

590
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,860
Speaker 0: And the thing is, it's not just character continuity.

591
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,548
Speaker 1: External continuity.

592
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:48,580
Speaker 1: He'll mention a spell.

593
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:54,000
Speaker 1: And you bet that if you look, the characters are the right level based on everything going on.

594
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,100
Speaker 1: And the thing is, he's got so many aspects, right?

595
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,568
Speaker 0: The political realm is covered.

596
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:00,555
Speaker 0: He's got the fantasy history.

597
00:33:00,956 --> 00:33:02,100
Speaker 0: The lore is covered.

598
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,140
Speaker 0: He's even got shit with the kind of weird breaking the fourth wall shit.

599
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:09,640
Speaker 1: Summon plot element.

600
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:15,839
Speaker 0: Right, the girlfriend who's a fairy from another plane who comes with the lawyers ends up being legit.

601
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:23,080
Speaker 0: Even the cockroaches, which are sort of like the old guys of The Muppet Show, are actually part of the plot for reals.

602
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:32,620
Speaker 0: And it's like every little thing, even stuff that seems like it's only there for jokes or props or whatever, is actually for reals and it counts and it's always there.

603
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,466
Speaker 1: There is a thing that happens.

604
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:36,834
Speaker 1: Remember, there's a girdle of gender changing that they find.

605
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:41,079
Speaker 0: I bet someone's wearing it right now and you don't even know.

606
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:47,900
Speaker 1: In the first ten strips and it comes back way later than you'd expect out of nowhere.

607
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,637
Speaker 0: But the thing is, if you've read the whole comic, when it comes out you're just like, "Oh yeah, the girdle of gender

608
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:53,879
Speaker 0: changes.".

609
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,320
Speaker 1: The best way I'd put it, in a Guy Ritchie movie, the number of bullets that people fire matters.

610
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:04,820
Speaker 1: In the order of the stick, the number of seventh level spells that someone casts matters.

611
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,275
Speaker 1: And it's weird.

612
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,610
Speaker 0: It's like some guy would be like, "Oh, I didn't memorize that today.

613
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,058
Speaker 0: I actually used all my spells

614
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:11,380
Speaker 0: already.".

615
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,139
Speaker 0: And if you go back and check, yeah he did.

616
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:19,800
Speaker 1: And it's weird because I don't like that sort of thing in certain kinds of stories.

617
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:26,920
Speaker 1: But I think it's because this is a story that's also kind of making light of Dungeons and Dragons and fitting inside of these rules.

618
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,340
Speaker 1: Like characters living in a world where they know the rules of the world.

619
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing is because you've been in that world with those rules, you can really identify with them.

620
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,137
Speaker 0: When they're sitting there being like, "How do we tell this person about this horrible thing that

621
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:38,418
Speaker 0: happened?".

622
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,980
Speaker 0: Well, you can't use sending because that doesn't work because then I need to have something that belongs to them or some shit.

623
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,250
Speaker 0: Do you have anything?

624
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,239
Speaker 0: I don't know.

625
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:50,280
Speaker 0: It's that same problem solving, the same exact discussions.

626
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,250
Speaker 1: Alright, I can only send 25 words.

627
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,577
Speaker 1: Well, I can cast it three times.

628
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:54,018
Speaker 0: Let's go.

629
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,658
Speaker 0: These are the same discussions that you have out of character when you're playing D&D.

630
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,120
Speaker 0: Only these are the characters having them in character, but they're the exact same discussion.

631
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:05,370
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Oh my god, that's

632
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:05,813
Speaker 0: awesome.".

633
00:35:07,662 --> 00:35:08,366
Speaker 1: It's a great comic.

634
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:08,949
Speaker 1: You should read it.

635
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,840
Speaker 1: It's all online free.

636
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,607
Speaker 0: Even if you don't like D&D.

637
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:14,660
Speaker 0: Well, not all online except for the volumes that aren't online.

638
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,222
Speaker 1: Except for those.

639
00:35:15,262 --> 00:35:20,060
Speaker 1: But the main story, you don't need to read Superman, Special Edition, and X Factor.

640
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,340
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

641
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,116
Speaker 1: But it's all online and the art is simple.

642
00:35:24,177 --> 00:35:24,560
Speaker 1: It sticks.

643
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:27,110
Speaker 0: It's not just sticks.

644
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,580
Speaker 0: It's squares and circles and triangles.

645
00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:31,778
Speaker 1: The art really serves the kind of story that it is.

646
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,420
Speaker 1: And two, despite its simplicity, it actually gets noticeably better as the story goes on.

647
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can actually see even though it's still the same character designs, the same circles and sticks, he gets better at it.

648
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,027
Speaker 0: He adds in the shading and the coloring.

649
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:48,240
Speaker 0: The actual graphical quality improves.

650
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,237
Speaker 0: And in fact, he does a lot of stuff that's sort of artistically experimental.

651
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,740
Speaker 0: Like there's the crayon comics and stuff like that.

652
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:03,540
Speaker 0: So it's not just some poorly done sprite crapo stick comic.

653
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:05,368
Speaker 0: It's actually good.

654
00:36:05,388 --> 00:36:08,060
Speaker 0: The same way the XKCD is good, despite it just being sticks.

655
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,598
Speaker 1: Now what's interesting is, for me personally, we found this comic right away.

656
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,884
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

657
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:13,708
Speaker 1: It tells how old I am.

658
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:16,020
Speaker 1: I do not remember how I found it.

659
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,219
Speaker 0: Pretty sure someone else found it and just told us to read it.

660
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:20,069
Speaker 1: I don't know how I found Penny Arcade.

661
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,100
Speaker 1: I couldn't tell you how I found real life.

662
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,999
Speaker 1: I found Megatokyo because Slashdot linked to it.

663
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,446
Speaker 0: That is correct.

664
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:27,840
Speaker 0: I found Megatokyo because Slashdot linked to it.

665
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,360
Speaker 1: And then we all read Megatokyo religiously and talked about it after every update for a while.

666
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,618
Speaker 0: Even though it really made no sense.

667
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,960
Speaker 1: That was the early days of webcomics being a big thing.

668
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:41,970
Speaker 1: But we found Order of the Stick and I know we found it right away because I remember thinking, "Hey, this is pretty

669
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:42,235
Speaker 1: good.".

670
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,880
Speaker 1: And I hit back to the beginning and there were only like eight or nine strips.

671
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,894
Speaker 1: And then I was up to the current time.

672
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,100
Speaker 0: I definitely started reading it while they were in that first dungeon.

673
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,819
Speaker 0: So I've been reading it for a long time, which means I'm better than you.

674
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:04,600
Speaker 1: But I remember there was a time like a year and a half ago, where for whatever reason I kind of stopped reading all my webcomics.

675
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:05,557
Speaker 1: All of them?

676
00:37:05,883 --> 00:37:07,480
Speaker 1: As in the only ones I was still reading.

677
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,700
Speaker 0: I wake up and read them every morning.

678
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,300
Speaker 1: It was Penny Arcade and, you know, like the super car.

679
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,554
Speaker 1: And I kind of forgot about Order of the Stick and Dr.

680
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:15,380
Speaker 1: McNinja for a while.

681
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:16,689
Speaker 0: Whoa, if I forget about Dr.

682
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:17,719
Speaker 0: McNinja, what the fuck?

683
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,293
Speaker 1: And then I corrected the Dr.

684
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:19,940
Speaker 1: McNinja problem.

685
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,776
Speaker 1: Like one day I was like, "Oh shit, Dr.

686
00:37:21,796 --> 00:37:22,200
Speaker 1: McNinja!".

687
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,620
Speaker 1: And I read all the strips I'd missed.

688
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,557
Speaker 1: So like four months ago, I was like, "Oh right, Order of the

689
00:37:27,618 --> 00:37:27,960
Speaker 1: Stick!".

690
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:32,200
Speaker 1: And I went back and until I found the point where I'd stopped reading.

691
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:34,239
Speaker 1: And I just started reading again.

692
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:35,819
Speaker 1: And the next thing I knew, I was all caught up.

693
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,200
Speaker 1: And that was like hitting a brick wall.

694
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:41,533
Speaker 1: Now like every morning I check, like, "Did he update?

695
00:37:41,674 --> 00:37:42,257
Speaker 1: Did he update?

696
00:37:42,277 --> 00:37:42,318
Speaker 1: Oh

697
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:42,720
Speaker 1: shit!".

698
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,859
Speaker 0: He's been updating more now that he doesn't need to worry about monies.

699
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, also the plots pick it up in a big way.

700
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:50,160
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, something exciting is going to happen real soon.

701
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:50,939
Speaker 1: Yes, Icon!

702
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,920
Speaker 0: So it's a good time to get on this ball, right?

703
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,120
Speaker 0: While the, you know, the rising tide.

704
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:03,659
Speaker 1: Yep, and unlike some webcomics where maybe you don't want to go back to the very beginning and read, this is one where you do.

705
00:38:03,944 --> 00:38:04,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, you definitely do.

706
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,960
Speaker 1: If you haven't read it, just literally start at number one and go.

707
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,800
Speaker 1: There's no reason to skip the beginning, it's great.

708
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,420
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

709
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,540
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
