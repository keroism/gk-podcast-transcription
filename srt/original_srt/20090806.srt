1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,287
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, August 6th.

2
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:12,110
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:12,933
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:25,878
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, Kineticon 2009, where we ran every panel in panel 5.

5
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:26,900
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,248
Speaker 1: So, about five seconds ago, we recorded the third take of the opening to this episode, and I failed at it.

7
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:40,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we got nothing.

8
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:46,035
Speaker 1: Previously, I also failed at it, and before that, we combinedly failed at it.

9
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:47,903
Speaker 0: There's nothing going on.

10
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:48,485
Speaker 1: I did.

11
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:50,073
Speaker 1: I'm not saving it for an outtake.

12
00:00:50,153 --> 00:00:50,756
Speaker 1: It's just gone.

13
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:51,439
Speaker 1: I deleted it.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,407
Speaker 1: I destroyed information.

15
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:55,296
Speaker 0: It's a convention recovery week.

16
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:56,300
Speaker 0: We're going to work.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:56,882
Speaker 0: We're coming home.

18
00:00:56,902 --> 00:00:57,606
Speaker 0: We're going to bed.

19
00:00:57,626 --> 00:00:58,812
Speaker 0: There is nothing.

20
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:02,573
Speaker 1: Well, I got one thing, though, because, you know, my car has been busted for, like, ever.

21
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:13,655
Speaker 1: So, I was, like, biking to work and staying in Emily's apartment because it's closer to the train, and I could walk down there, because it's, like, two and a half miles to the train station from here, and, you know, my bike got stolen.

22
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:19,275
Speaker 1: So, I'm walking back from the train station yesterday, and it takes, like, you know, 20 minutes to walk home.

23
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:20,701
Speaker 1: And along the way...

24
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:21,807
Speaker 0: I thought you rollerbladed.

25
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,575
Speaker 1: Well, no, yesterday, I walked.

26
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:25,223
Speaker 1: Today, I rollerbladed.

27
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:25,765
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

28
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:39,794
Speaker 1: So, yesterday, you know, I'm walking and all I can think in my head... You know, I see a kid riding by on his bike and I just hear da-da-ra-da-ra-da da... the Pee Weez big adventure theme just in my head.

29
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:42,308
Speaker 1: I'm, like, scoping every kid out, like, "Is that my bike?

30
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,153
Speaker 1: Is that my bike?

31
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:43,777
Speaker 1: Where's my bike?

32
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:44,280
Speaker 1: Son of a bitch.

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,143
Speaker 1: my bike somewhere.

34
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:48,212
Speaker 1: But you know, no bike, no car.

35
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,600
Speaker 1: I had to resort to the rollerblades.

36
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,016
Speaker 1: Let me tell you once again, New York as a state hates rollerblades.

37
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:56,723
Speaker 1: It just hates everything about them.

38
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,109
Speaker 1: All the sidewalks suck.

39
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,476
Speaker 1: There's nowhere to rollerblade.

40
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:01,607
Speaker 1: There's like gravel and grit and everything all over the roads.

41
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:02,814
Speaker 1: There's these hills everywhere.

42
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:08,508
Speaker 1: Rollerblading at night in the dark in New York is possibly the worst thing in the world.

43
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,888
Speaker 1: It's a, you know, you can rollerblade like anywhere.

44
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:18,099
Speaker 1: The sidewalk is like perfectly stray.

45
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,465
Speaker 0: You go to that cool park.

46
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:21,454
Speaker 0: That was all parkour ish that we were in.

47
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:22,780
Speaker 1: Man, you know what's cool?

48
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,670
Speaker 0: I learned more right attached to the convention center.

49
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:35,573
Speaker 1: I learned about freestyle walking and freestyle running, which is like baby parkour, but it's basically just walk quickly on weird stuff and in weird places and more and more.

50
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:40,191
Speaker 1: I want the culture of Seattle to appear here because I think parkour is awesome.

51
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,060
Speaker 1: And here we don't even have punk skate kids.

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,771
Speaker 1: The skate park has been abandoned for two years.

53
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,924
Speaker 1: It's just been this flat, empty, like fenced off area.

54
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:48,266
Speaker 0: Really?

55
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:51,904
Speaker 0: Cause I saw some skater kids sitting at the old high school like the other day.

56
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:57,570
Speaker 1: There's skater kids about, but there's nowhere to skateboard except the skate park, but the skate park is just flat now.

57
00:02:58,494 --> 00:02:58,836
Speaker 1: Really?

58
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:02,494
Speaker 1: I don't know if Beacon ran out of money or what, but there's no more skate park as far as I can see.

59
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:03,338
Speaker 0: That's weird.

60
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:03,901
Speaker 0: It's there.

61
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:05,349
Speaker 0: Like you have a ramp.

62
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,460
Speaker 0: All you need is a swimming pool without any water in it.

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:07,861
Speaker 0: Really?

64
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:08,122
Speaker 0: Yeah.

65
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:08,845
Speaker 1: You need some bumps.

66
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:12,600
Speaker 1: You need like a bumper too, and a rail and a half pipe.

67
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:14,445
Speaker 0: They're not expensive.

68
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:15,972
Speaker 0: They're real cheap.

69
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:16,354
Speaker 1: I don't know.

70
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:16,716
Speaker 1: Maybe.

71
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:24,877
Speaker 1: I don't know why beacon doesn't have them there anymore, but I feel like the thing you can do to make any town in the world better is give punk kids a place to hang out and hurt themselves.

72
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:27,142
Speaker 0: That's not drugs.

73
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:27,363
Speaker 1: Yeah.

74
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:30,933
Speaker 1: Cause if there's nothing to do, it's either Mario or drugs.

75
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:31,655
Speaker 0: Yep.

76
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,868
Speaker 0: If kids are out, the kids don't do drugs outside.

77
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:35,873
Speaker 0: They do drugs inside.

78
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,160
Speaker 0: So you make outside fun.

79
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,963
Speaker 0: They won't do drugs.

80
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:38,505
Speaker 1: They want to go.

81
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:42,037
Speaker 1: We, so give them a kid and you want to go.

82
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,085
Speaker 0: We, but you ain't got drugs.

83
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:44,527
Speaker 0: All right.

84
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:46,617
Speaker 1: So anyway, uh, you know, it's Thursday.

85
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:52,740
Speaker 1: It's always the fast and lose geek nights and we're doing a convention review, which is interesting.

86
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:58,767
Speaker 1: And I came up with this idea completely in a self-serving way because, Hey, it's hard to come up with Thursday show ideas.

87
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:00,716
Speaker 0: There is the day we should qualify that.

88
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:08,108
Speaker 1: it's easy to come up with Thursday show ideas, but here's how the, uh, Thursday afternoon conversation goes, Hey Scott, let's do a show on blah.

89
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,674
Speaker 1: I'm not feeling it.

90
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,100
Speaker 1: How about a show on blah?

91
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,771
Speaker 1: Well, I got like five minutes of shit to say about that.

92
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:14,937
Speaker 1: What do you want to do?

93
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:15,660
Speaker 1: I don't know.

94
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,423
Speaker 0: There's nothing to do Thursday.

95
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:22,417
Speaker 1: And then you're like, how about we do a show on fire?

96
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,545
Speaker 1: Like we already did part one of that.

97
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:29,222
Speaker 0: There's nothing to do Thursday shows, except everything, except nothing.

98
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:33,418
Speaker 0: Everything just doesn't want to admit that there are no Thursday shows.

99
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:34,603
Speaker 1: I got plenty of ideas.

100
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:37,436
Speaker 0: And so we made the book club just to fill up Thursday shows.

101
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:37,758
Speaker 0: Yeah.

102
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,847
Speaker 1: So how far are you on a Steppenwolf there, Scott?

103
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,313
Speaker 0: I'm reading comic books instead.

104
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:43,763
Speaker 0: How far are you on, uh, any comic book?

105
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,071
Speaker 1: I'm about halfway through contract with God.

106
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:47,296
Speaker 1: I just read Crenshon.

107
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:51,249
Speaker 1: I just read, I just finished reading Orion and black magic.

108
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:52,052
Speaker 0: Yeah.

109
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:52,513
Speaker 0: Good choice.

110
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:52,935
Speaker 0: Yes.

111
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:53,778
Speaker 1: Great stuff.

112
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:54,440
Speaker 0: Anyway.

113
00:04:55,381 --> 00:05:00,979
Speaker 0: And, uh, so we're like, Hey, you know, kinetic con isn't an anime con or a gaming con.

114
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,785
Speaker 0: It's an everything con.

115
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:06,136
Speaker 1: Connecticut Connecticut in Hartford, Connecticut, really?

116
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:11,799
Speaker 0: Like it says right on the cover of the book, everything, but the kitchen sink, the con stands out for me.

117
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,220
Speaker 1: And every year it's weird how I would always be kind of unexcited about Connecticut and go before it.

118
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,035
Speaker 1: I'd always think of it as this con like, yeah, that's like the con we go to.

119
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:24,531
Speaker 1: Well, after all the other cards, this is where we test all our stuff.

120
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:33,628
Speaker 1: But then I'm at Connecticut and suddenly I realized, Oh man, this is the con where everything cool happens because there's no restriction of just being about anime.

121
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,938
Speaker 1: Daryl Surratt can't complain about Connecticut.

122
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,102
Speaker 0: No, he can't.

123
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:38,187
Speaker 0: It's an everything con.

124
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,697
Speaker 0: Everything geeky is allowed at Connecticut.

125
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:42,366
Speaker 0: They even have like belly dancing and shit.

126
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:43,713
Speaker 1: It's good belly dancing too.

127
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:44,557
Speaker 0: It's pretty awesome.

128
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,650
Speaker 1: I wonder if it's the same person who was at the other con.

129
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,204
Speaker 0: I don't know if they were at another con, but it's the same person who's been at Connecticut multiple times.

130
00:05:50,345 --> 00:06:00,897
Speaker 1: One thing I've seen, you know, I used to lot of belly dancing at those kinds and it was the same person doing it everywhere.

131
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:01,178
Speaker 1: Yep.

132
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:08,602
Speaker 0: So doing our, uh, Thursday show as the Connecticut is like this great move because we kill off a Thursday show.

133
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:11,577
Speaker 0: We can do the Connecticut show while it's still fresh in our mind.

134
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,297
Speaker 1: More importantly, I want more people to go to Connecticut because it's a pretty big con.

135
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:22,040
Speaker 1: There's like six, 7,000 people, but I think a lot more people would go if they realize that it's not an anime con.

136
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,251
Speaker 0: The thing is it felt like less people than last year.

137
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:26,362
Speaker 0: I don't know what the actual numbers were comparable.

138
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:29,053
Speaker 1: It was a little over 6,000 comparable comparable.

139
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:30,700
Speaker 1: They were, they're able to be compared.

140
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,148
Speaker 1: So comparable anyway.

141
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:39,212
Speaker 0: Uh, so yeah, that's what we're gonna do today, but, uh, do you want to do news and things of the day or do you want to skip it or what?

142
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:40,580
Speaker 1: I got some things to talk about.

143
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,222
Speaker 1: All right.

144
00:06:41,323 --> 00:06:42,248
Speaker 1: This is real interesting.

145
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,961
Speaker 1: You know, I have a vested interest in New York City in general.

146
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:45,804
Speaker 1: You know, I worked there.

147
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:47,872
Speaker 1: I'd like to live there someday.

148
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:50,884
Speaker 1: It kind of, it is the center of the world.

149
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,190
Speaker 1: It is the center of the economy.

150
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,222
Speaker 1: It's the center of basically my entire professional career in life.

151
00:06:56,546 --> 00:07:05,720
Speaker 1: And it has some problems in that it already has like this gigantic mass transit system where you go to Seattle, you go to DC and they have like these baby mass transit systems.

152
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:17,268
Speaker 1: Like I don't, it was our friend Adam who pointed this out to me, you know, he, he was in New York, he had a friend who was in New York and you moved to DC and he had this friend visit him in DC and the guy was like, yeah, how do I get to your house?

153
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:20,460
Speaker 1: He's like, take the red line, like four stops.

154
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,506
Speaker 1: He's like, what do you mean red line?

155
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:22,311
Speaker 1: That's complicated.

156
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:24,343
Speaker 1: Uh, how am I going to figure it out when I get there?

157
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,493
Speaker 1: And the guy's like, you lived in New York city, right?

158
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:27,137
Speaker 1: Yeah.

159
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,014
Speaker 1: Well, imagine if the New York city subway map was drawn in crayon for fourth graders.

160
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:33,480
Speaker 0: That's the Metro.

161
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:39,419
Speaker 1: So New York already has like this giant transit system, but it's already at capacity.

162
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,286
Speaker 1: Like I can't get on the sixth train.

163
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:42,189
Speaker 1: It's just too crowded.

164
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:48,559
Speaker 1: And people in New York state and New York city don't want to spend more money on it because no one likes to pay taxes.

165
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,337
Speaker 1: And they're trying to figure out ways to make the transit system better.

166
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:56,297
Speaker 1: And they're making all these improvements, but Mary Bloomberg to his credit, just put out there.

167
00:07:56,338 --> 00:08:03,765
Speaker 1: This one of those crazy ideas where you hear it and you think that's crazy, but then you think about it and you realize that's just crazy enough to work.

168
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,335
Speaker 1: Let me tell you a tale of the M 42 bus.

169
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:08,618
Speaker 0: Oh God.

170
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:11,287
Speaker 1: It's the only way to get across town in midtown.

171
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:17,148
Speaker 1: If you want to go across blocks, there's basically no way you can walk, take the shuttle to time square.

172
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:20,340
Speaker 0: Basically Manhattan is very tall, but it's not very wide.

173
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:24,680
Speaker 0: It only takes so many minutes to walk all the way across from the East to the West.

174
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,085
Speaker 1: But it still, it takes a while.

175
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:29,340
Speaker 0: It does take a while, but it doesn't take that long.

176
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,054
Speaker 1: It takes like 20 minutes to walk across depending on where you are.

177
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:33,717
Speaker 0: That's about right.

178
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,597
Speaker 0: If you just keep walking and don't stop and dilly dally or get anything in your way, whatever.

179
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:43,604
Speaker 1: But if I have to go to like the Javits for an anime con or a comic con or something, it's pretty much always going to be raining.

180
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:44,729
Speaker 0: Dad sucks.

181
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,368
Speaker 1: So I ended up taking a cab and is miserable, but there's basically no way to get across town.

182
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:50,520
Speaker 1: and they're not going to extend the seven line forever.

183
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,483
Speaker 1: They're going to someday.

184
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:55,179
Speaker 0: And there's like the S, which doesn't take you very far at all.

185
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,144
Speaker 0: It's like, why would I take the S?

186
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:56,928
Speaker 0: I can walk that far.

187
00:08:56,948 --> 00:09:03,498
Speaker 1: It's so short, but there is the infamous M 42 bus that goes back and forth on 42nd street, which is like the crosstown route.

188
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:04,763
Speaker 0: It also goes to Javits, right?

189
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:05,265
Speaker 1: It does.

190
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:09,862
Speaker 1: And let me tell you, um, I walk faster than that bus, even when there's no traffic.

191
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,432
Speaker 0: There's so much traffic, right?

192
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,339
Speaker 0: That's like, that's the reason I don't do buses.

193
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,679
Speaker 0: Cause the point of using mass transit is I don't want to be in the traffic, right?

194
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:23,301
Speaker 0: It's like, if I'm going to be in the traffic, I'll just fricking drive my tiny car and pass by everyone else.

195
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:28,079
Speaker 0: Uh, so if I'm going to get in a bus, right, it better pass by all the traffic.

196
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:31,294
Speaker 0: So the better, like a bus lane or something, no one else can get into at all.

197
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:31,997
Speaker 1: Seattle has that.

198
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:41,210
Speaker 1: It's pretty good, but yeah, it basically, my ideas with mass transit are that we need absolutely radical, very expensive taxpayer funded initiatives for mass transit.

199
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:46,613
Speaker 1: And the ox, the actual solution, in my opinion, you also have to just Dick over easily.

200
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:51,093
Speaker 0: If you want mass transit to succeed, you have to make it Dick over the non mass transit.

201
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,762
Speaker 0: Be like, Oh, well, yeah, we're just not good.

202
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:54,872
Speaker 0: We're going to have one less driving lane on this road.

203
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:55,777
Speaker 0: Fuck you cars.

204
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:56,782
Speaker 0: That's how you gotta be.

205
00:09:56,802 --> 00:09:57,908
Speaker 0: If you want mass transit to work.

206
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:09,838
Speaker 1: So my crazy idea, you know, the thing I think should happen is we need like every 10 blocks and crosstown back and forth, constantly moving trolley that you just say every five, you just walk up and you just kind of hop on.

207
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:13,132
Speaker 1: It goes like 30 miles an hour, 15 miles an hour, something nice and slow.

208
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:17,349
Speaker 1: Maybe it slows down in certain loading areas, but it's just free.

209
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,296
Speaker 1: It just goes as a robot.

210
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:20,843
Speaker 1: So it doesn't run over little kids or something.

211
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:24,825
Speaker 0: They should just have a, you know, like at the airport where they had a conveyor belts to go back and forth.

212
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:28,179
Speaker 1: How are things that go perpendicular to it going to get over it?

213
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,393
Speaker 1: If it's a conveyor belt, it has to stop for the perpendicular things.

214
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:35,162
Speaker 0: It'll just, the whole thing will stop.

215
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:36,567
Speaker 1: Yeah.

216
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,213
Speaker 1: So when does it stop?

217
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:38,976
Speaker 1: It's a conveyor belt.

218
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:39,578
Speaker 1: It just stops.

219
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:40,662
Speaker 1: All the bad people fall over.

220
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:42,270
Speaker 0: It synchronizes the traffic lights.

221
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:44,843
Speaker 0: So when the cars are going north and south, it stops.

222
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:46,954
Speaker 0: And then when the cars are going east and west, it moves.

223
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,164
Speaker 1: Uh, anyway, you know, crazy ideas like that.

224
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:50,148
Speaker 1: Just do something crazy.

225
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:54,143
Speaker 1: But mayor Bloomberg, he put forth a similarly crazy idea.

226
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,331
Speaker 1: We've got these buses and they suck.

227
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,498
Speaker 1: Why don't we just make them?

228
00:10:58,598 --> 00:10:59,682
Speaker 1: Why don't we just make them free?

229
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:01,429
Speaker 1: Just drive them all the time.

230
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:02,513
Speaker 1: Anyone can get gone.

231
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:03,317
Speaker 1: Anyone can get off.

232
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:06,090
Speaker 1: You have to wait and collect fares.

233
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:07,276
Speaker 1: It'll make them move faster.

234
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:08,903
Speaker 1: It'll be more efficient, less overhead.

235
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:14,162
Speaker 1: And if it takes any congestion off of any of the other stuff, we'll basically make money on it.

236
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:18,837
Speaker 1: And people are mad about this and I don't understand why.

237
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:20,542
Speaker 0: Why would you be mad about it?

238
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:22,750
Speaker 1: Because it might cost more initially.

239
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,313
Speaker 1: I don't know.

240
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:29,630
Speaker 1: It seems like people just ravel about mass transit because they feel like mass transit has to be profitable.

241
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:35,929
Speaker 1: They think of mass than we get out of it directly.

242
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:42,920
Speaker 1: It's a waste of money because they don't understand all the kind of secondary and tertiary benefits that they can't see that actually in the end are a net profit.

243
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,877
Speaker 0: But the problem is that the government is run like a business, right?

244
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:53,155
Speaker 0: In that, you know, you have to, you know, the, the, the checkbook has to be in the black.

245
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:59,082
Speaker 1: And while, you know, you shouldn't spend, well, except it's not in the black and it's never been in the black, right?

246
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:02,816
Speaker 0: First of all, you shouldn't spend more than you've taxed.

247
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:03,760
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

248
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:04,441
Speaker 0: Right.

249
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:05,244
Speaker 1: Not necessarily.

250
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:06,689
Speaker 0: However, right.

251
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:16,342
Speaker 0: Just because an individual thing that you are spending money on isn't bringing a, you know, a return on investment in cash back into the government coffers.

252
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:22,044
Speaker 0: If it's, you know, it's, it's the government's job is not to, you know, be profitable.

253
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:24,235
Speaker 0: I mean, you're basically take tax money, spend it.

254
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:27,589
Speaker 0: You don't have to make the money back as long as you tax it.

255
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,657
Speaker 1: The government really has one job.

256
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:31,806
Speaker 1: And that is to make sure that Mad Max doesn't happen.

257
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:32,208
Speaker 1: Right.

258
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:32,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

259
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,037
Speaker 1: That's basically what it does.

260
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:35,204
Speaker 1: But, you know, I digress.

261
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:36,452
Speaker 1: We don't want to talk about this forever.

262
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:37,580
Speaker 1: You want to hear about Connecticut?

263
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,283
Speaker 1: That's why you're here.

264
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:42,602
Speaker 1: Anyway, I bring this up because I suggested not that long ago show about mass transit.

265
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,370
Speaker 1: Scott was like, I have nothing to say about that.

266
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:45,897
Speaker 0: What's there to say?

267
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:46,560
Speaker 0: It sucks.

268
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,485
Speaker 0: It's never gonna be fixed.

269
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:47,828
Speaker 0: Clearly.

270
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,700
Speaker 1: We had a lot to say, and I think it will be fixed someday.

271
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:51,165
Speaker 0: I don't think it'll ever be fixed.

272
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:51,566
Speaker 0: OK.

273
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:51,968
Speaker 0: Never.

274
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:52,469
Speaker 0: Anyway.

275
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:53,232
Speaker 0: Anyway.

276
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:57,770
Speaker 0: So there's just an overflow of tech news relative to other news is right.

277
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,985
Speaker 0: There's not so much gaming news, but there will be after PAX, I guarantee it.

278
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,986
Speaker 0: And there's not so much anime news because we already used it all in the San Diego and the Otakons.

279
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:07,753
Speaker 0: But there's a ton of tech news.

280
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:11,328
Speaker 0: And we don't have enough to you know, if we only did it on Monday, we wouldn't get to it all.

281
00:13:11,348 --> 00:13:14,098
Speaker 0: So I want to do this one real quick today.

282
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:15,824
Speaker 0: Google or yesterday, I don't remember.

283
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:22,666
Speaker 0: recently Google bought this company, right, called on to I'm pretty sure that's what their name is.

284
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:24,516
Speaker 0: And they basically make video codecs.

285
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:24,999
Speaker 0: That's what they do.

286
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:36,034
Speaker 0: And the thing behind this is it relates to something we talked about previously on the show, HTML, but the HTML five video codecs is the Ogg Theora.

287
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:36,335
Speaker 0: Right.

288
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:45,110
Speaker 0: The open source video codec was actually basically what happened is this company, the onto company, made a bunch of different codecs and they kept making new versions of it.

289
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:50,171
Speaker 0: One of their old versions, I think, like version two or version five or three, I forget what number.

290
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,242
Speaker 0: they're already on numbers 18.

291
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:55,288
Speaker 0: They're already on version nine.

292
00:13:55,489 --> 00:14:00,062
Speaker 0: So an old version of their of their codec was open sourced, right?

293
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:01,687
Speaker 0: Unconditionally.

294
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,956
Speaker 0: And that was what was the foundation for Ogg Theora.

295
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:05,358
Speaker 0: Right.

296
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:12,358
Speaker 0: And one of the big arguments against Ogg Theora is that it's just not quality enough compared to like H.264.

297
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,533
Speaker 0: But it is open source, which means and there's no it's you know, it's.

298
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:20,210
Speaker 0: but there's still some questions of like patent encumbrance.

299
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,759
Speaker 0: I don't know where those questions are coming from.

300
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:27,440
Speaker 0: So basically Google, you know, this is a big battle of H.264 versus, you know, Ogg Theora.

301
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,500
Speaker 0: If Google is going to buy this company, well, they already did buy this company.

302
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,591
Speaker 1: Clearly they have some sort of plan.

303
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:33,752
Speaker 0: Yeah.

304
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:45,499
Speaker 0: Basically what they're going to do is they're going to remove, you know, most likely they're going to remove all patent encumbrance from Ogg and from the newer codecs from this onto company, at least insofar as that can be done.

305
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:49,333
Speaker 1: because patent it's yeah, there's always some regardless.

306
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:50,517
Speaker 1: I mean, Twitter just got sued.

307
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:55,682
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're going to yeah, they're going to, you know, get rid of all those sorts of problems with their Google monies.

308
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:56,022
Speaker 0: Right.

309
00:14:56,423 --> 00:15:00,311
Speaker 0: And they're going to, you know, open source this better codec.

310
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:01,013
Speaker 0: Right.

311
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:17,234
Speaker 0: And so basically all the browse, you know, they're going to be like, all right, look, you people, we may, we got this new codec, you know, it's bigger and better and better than your Ogg Theoras and it's open source and it's not in comfort.

312
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:17,555
Speaker 0: All right.

313
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:18,840
Speaker 0: So now you got no complaints.

314
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,812
Speaker 0: It's basically the, you know, there were all these arguments against H.264 and all these arguments against Ogg Theora.

315
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:27,467
Speaker 0: Well, it's like, they're going to say, here, we just bought this one.

316
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:29,456
Speaker 0: This doesn't have any of those complaints.

317
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:30,400
Speaker 0: Everyone fucking use it.

318
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,195
Speaker 0: If anyone says no, then they're going to be like, well, why not?

319
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:35,179
Speaker 0: You know, fuck you.

320
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:38,588
Speaker 0: Look, you got no complaints against this.

321
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,202
Speaker 0: So it's going to be interesting to see what complaints people have against it.

322
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:52,316
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

323
00:15:52,696 --> 00:16:08,501
Speaker 1: So at Connecticut, we, the one time we really got to get out of the room and go anywhere other than panel five, uh, uh, uh, uh, panel five, but somehow it doesn't quite have the same energy when you're not in the room and there's a crowd there.

324
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,029
Speaker 0: This goes to likes disco panels.

325
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,660
Speaker 1: We need a disco panel, something fierce about disco.

326
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,890
Speaker 1: I know a little bit about disco enough to do a panel.

327
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,722
Speaker 1: I think I could put together a panel on disco.

328
00:16:20,842 --> 00:16:26,203
Speaker 0: If you got a book about disco and read it, then you could do a panel of Wikipedia plus YouTube equals disco panel.

329
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:27,125
Speaker 1: It's not that hard.

330
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:39,702
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, so we went to super art fight and I got to see two of the three fights because then I had to go do stuff before I saw all three fights.

331
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:41,207
Speaker 1: Well, I can say one thing.

332
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:49,393
Speaker 1: The first fight, uh, our friend Yuko of Johnny wander fame, uh, competed and won, even though to be fair, it was a Yuko crowd.

333
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:52,724
Speaker 0: It was a, it seems like the art fight really did.

334
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:55,134
Speaker 0: The crowd did matter a lot, you know?

335
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:58,727
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is it, the whole thing is it's not the quality of the art necessarily.

336
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:06,819
Speaker 1: It's who grandstands for the crowd the most and the best, but when the ref brought out the yellow flag, that was when I lost it.

337
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:11,180
Speaker 1: But we, you know, beforehand there's these six panels and two artists have to draw stuff.

338
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,911
Speaker 1: And every few minutes they change this spinner.

339
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:17,325
Speaker 1: And then the artists are given more things to incorporate into the drawing.

340
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:21,701
Speaker 1: So ahead of time, we bought sight unseen for $20.

341
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:24,732
Speaker 1: The lower left panel, which is where you go with standing.

342
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:28,464
Speaker 1: And ahead of time, we yelled at her other than use a splash attack.

343
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:38,032
Speaker 1: You go to make our panel proud and lo and behold, our panel has super macho man, Randy Savage attorney at law.

344
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:45,031
Speaker 1: I would like to note the tank briefcase and behind him is Bruce Campbell in a Bill Cosby sweater.

345
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:45,533
Speaker 1: Yep.

346
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:54,026
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day is that, and if you look online, you can probably find some sort of picture of all six panels together, but super art fight.

347
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:59,833
Speaker 1: If you ever see it, because it is done live, not just at fan conventions, but out in the real world, you should check it out.

348
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:02,264
Speaker 0: I guess we don't need to talk about that during the show then.

349
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:02,847
Speaker 1: No, we don't.

350
00:18:02,988 --> 00:18:03,751
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

351
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:04,514
Speaker 1: Is it awesome?

352
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:05,780
Speaker 1: Super art fight for the win.

353
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,140
Speaker 1: Yep.

354
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:09,170
Speaker 0: So, uh, what was my thing of the day?

355
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:15,753
Speaker 0: I guess on Kotaku, there was actually an article that wasn't just like a reprint of a press release.

356
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:17,580
Speaker 0: It was written by this guy in Japan.

357
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:21,252
Speaker 0: And he was talking about the Pokemon stamp rally.

358
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,015
Speaker 0: Do you know about this?

359
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:23,882
Speaker 1: I know nothing about this.

360
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,669
Speaker 0: Apparently it's been going on for 10 years.

361
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:30,225
Speaker 0: And the way it works right is they send out to all the kiddies, right?

362
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:34,139
Speaker 0: This little book that has spots for six stamps in it, right?

363
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,125
Speaker 1: Wait, do you have to go find these stamps?

364
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:43,005
Speaker 0: There are 95 train stations on the Japan, you know, basically the Japan train lines, right?

365
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:44,710
Speaker 0: That have stamps.

366
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:50,146
Speaker 0: So the way it works is you go and you get six stamps in your little book, right?

367
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:53,440
Speaker 0: By going to six train stations, any six train stations that have stamps.

368
00:18:53,881 --> 00:19:00,345
Speaker 0: And at these train stations is basically a guy there guarding the stamp and you walk up in line, you know, it's all kids, right?

369
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:01,873
Speaker 0: They walk up all polite in line.

370
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:05,128
Speaker 0: They walk up, he stamps your book and you go, right?

371
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:10,434
Speaker 1: Oh man, kids need some sort of yuck as a conspiracy where they knock that over, grab the stamp and run, right?

372
00:19:10,454 --> 00:19:12,363
Speaker 0: They have guards with all these stamps on tables.

373
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:13,729
Speaker 0: They've been doing this for 10 years.

374
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:15,618
Speaker 1: The kids are just not good enough.

375
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:16,382
Speaker 1: They need to pull a heist.

376
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,592
Speaker 0: So I don't think anyone's ever stolen the stamp.

377
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:25,642
Speaker 0: Anyway, you get six stamps and then you bring your little six stamp book to one of like the major stations like Tokyo or, you know, whatever.

378
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:29,414
Speaker 0: Then they give you an exchange for your six stamp book.

379
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,484
Speaker 0: They give you the 95 stamp book.

380
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:36,538
Speaker 0: They give you a Pikachu visor and some other stuff, right?

381
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:37,039
Speaker 0: Ooh.

382
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:46,400
Speaker 0: Then you go around getting all 95 stamps from all 95 train stations on the Japan train line.

383
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,752
Speaker 1: So, uh, the question is what do you get at the end of that Mewtwo?

384
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:52,502
Speaker 0: If you get all 95 stamps, right?

385
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:59,639
Speaker 0: Of all the 95 different Pokemans, then you have a chance to win various prizes.

386
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,240
Speaker 1: Like what?

387
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,274
Speaker 0: Basically crap like a stuffed Pokemon or this is so close.

388
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:16,505
Speaker 1: They need to just make the definitive Pokemon MMO that is on every platform and goes forever and have Pokemon in the real world with transponders hit as you can go.

389
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:27,745
Speaker 0: Regardless, this article was not, was, you know, it discussed the Pokemon stamp rally, but what it really discussed was like the mentality, the kleptomaniac mentality of like Japanese people.

390
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:31,380
Speaker 0: And it got into all this, you know, really, really interesting stuff.

391
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,825
Speaker 0: Like if one thing that was really interesting, he talked about was how, you know, in the U S we could rent video games, right?

392
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:44,572
Speaker 0: But, uh, in Japan, you know, they Nintendo and people actually put up a big fights that you couldn't rent video games in Japan.

393
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:53,790
Speaker 0: So what happened was in Japan, since there was no video game rental, the used video game market appeared much, much sooner than, you know, it did here, right?

394
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,949
Speaker 0: So we were pretty much buying games, beating them, selling them real quick and buy new ones.

395
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:58,250
Speaker 0: Right.

396
00:20:59,013 --> 00:20:59,675
Speaker 0: And, uh, anyone.

397
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:04,196
Speaker 0: then eventually, you know, market appeared for people who were just waiting by the used copies for cheap.

398
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:06,103
Speaker 0: And of course, Nintendo didn't like that.

399
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:12,482
Speaker 0: So, uh, what they did is they started making games, you know, that were long.

400
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:15,331
Speaker 0: And that's why you get like the JRPG.

401
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:16,675
Speaker 0: That's just incredibly long.

402
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:21,317
Speaker 0: And, you know, you see, you're not going to buy it and then return it used right away.

403
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:24,911
Speaker 0: It's going to be a longer before someone can get a used copy.

404
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:29,449
Speaker 0: greater chance that used copy buyers just going to buy the, you know, the full version with fans.

405
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:36,496
Speaker 1: I mean, you got, I go to like a GameStop or something and they'll have those brand new long games in the U S and GameStop.

406
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:39,187
Speaker 0: People steal games from one GameStop and sell them back to another one.

407
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:39,408
Speaker 0: Yeah.

408
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:40,534
Speaker 1: But that's, I digress.

409
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:41,016
Speaker 1: Yeah.

410
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:44,331
Speaker 0: But the point is this article is really, really fascinating and you should read it.

411
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:49,090
Speaker 1: I have one more minor thing of the day and it's relevant and pertinent and timely.

412
00:21:49,753 --> 00:21:49,974
Speaker 1: uncle.

413
00:21:49,994 --> 00:21:51,319
Speaker 1: Yo, was that Connecticut?

414
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:52,303
Speaker 1: Many of you saw his show.

415
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:54,933
Speaker 1: His show was basically standing room only Carl Custer.

416
00:21:55,676 --> 00:22:01,472
Speaker 1: He is doing his first for real comedy show out in the real world.

417
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,700
Speaker 0: As in not as a convention is not at a real world, right?

418
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:05,183
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

419
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:06,228
Speaker 1: It's a cloister.

420
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:08,439
Speaker 1: It's like this private walled garden.

421
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:16,632
Speaker 1: I mean, it is, it's a very different crowd that you get at like Oticon or Connecticut, then you get at like some place somewhere.

422
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:20,666
Speaker 0: Well, not if you, you know, tell all your friends to show up from conventions.

423
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:23,196
Speaker 1: It depends because normal people will be there too.

424
00:22:23,237 --> 00:22:35,854
Speaker 1: But this Saturday, August 8th at 7 PM at the drama lounge in the lower East village of New York city on 85th Avenue a between fifth and sixth street, uncle Joe will be there and 85 Avenue a not 85th.

425
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,450
Speaker 1: I was reading, I didn't know where it was way north.

426
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:46,238
Speaker 1: I saw this sentence and I read it as quickly as I could while I was doing other stuff and preparing for the rest of the show.

427
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:46,640
Speaker 1: Yep.

428
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:48,514
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's a link to it in our forums.

429
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,320
Speaker 1: There's link on the website.

430
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:50,907
Speaker 1: There's a pretty good chance.

431
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:51,811
Speaker 1: A lot of us will be there.

432
00:22:51,852 --> 00:22:52,857
Speaker 0: Scott won't go.

433
00:22:52,897 --> 00:22:56,009
Speaker 1: If I wasn't going to Connecticut, but Scott's going to Connecticut for something.

434
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:56,451
Speaker 0: Yep.

435
00:22:57,515 --> 00:22:57,856
Speaker 0: All right.

436
00:22:57,896 --> 00:23:00,785
Speaker 0: So Connecticut, oh shit.

437
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:02,491
Speaker 1: Connecticut, 2000.

438
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:04,940
Speaker 0: Talk about every single panel we did individually.

439
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,385
Speaker 1: I want to mention everything.

440
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,348
Speaker 1: I'll mention this.

441
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,260
Speaker 1: This was a very special Connecticut for us.

442
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,928
Speaker 1: a little bit of meta perspective here.

443
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:17,755
Speaker 1: We've been going to Connecticut for a number of years and very rapidly, our Connecticut experience has changed.

444
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:23,720
Speaker 1: The first year we went, we were just fans and we walked into the anime club like summit, how to run an anime club panel.

445
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,015
Speaker 1: The panel was kind of poorly run and was giving basically illegal advice.

446
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:31,465
Speaker 1: So we stood up and we're like, no, that's not how it is.

447
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:32,570
Speaker 1: And we ran the rest of the panel.

448
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:40,202
Speaker 1: We then kind of trashed Connecticut on geek nights and the con chair and the vice counter emailed us and said, yeah, you know what?

449
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:41,469
Speaker 1: All your complaints were justified.

450
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:42,755
Speaker 1: Put up or shut up.

451
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:43,439
Speaker 1: You want to fix it?

452
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:44,242
Speaker 1: And we were like, hells yeah.

453
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:45,769
Speaker 1: And the next year we did like seven panels.

454
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:53,380
Speaker 0: And every year we've done, you know, I have four Connecticut badges, so I don't, I don't really remember the sequence of events.

455
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:55,768
Speaker 0: I think we did seven panels last year.

456
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,639
Speaker 0: So the year before that, maybe we only did like two.

457
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,348
Speaker 1: No, we did more panels that year.

458
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:05,774
Speaker 1: And then we did fewer panels the next year because those panels killed us because we weren't good at doing that many panels.

459
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:06,658
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

460
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,633
Speaker 0: I need, I should save the con books, but I keep throwing them all over.

461
00:24:09,653 --> 00:24:10,437
Speaker 0: I remember pretty well.

462
00:24:10,537 --> 00:24:14,378
Speaker 1: And I have, you know, records of all the cons we go to and records of all the panels we've ever done.

463
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:18,220
Speaker 1: So I can show you a list of every single panel we've ever done at every con ever.

464
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:22,820
Speaker 1: Anyway, so we did all these things and every year, you know, we kind of escalated.

465
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,688
Speaker 1: this year was the penultimate escalation we did.

466
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:32,181
Speaker 1: Well, we produced or sponsored 37 panels at Connecticut.

467
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:36,752
Speaker 1: of those panels, 23 were 100% us and six more were mostly us.

468
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:36,892
Speaker 1: Yeah.

469
00:24:36,912 --> 00:24:45,056
Speaker 0: What, what percentage of those 23 were bullshit and which ones were real?

470
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:51,582
Speaker 1: I would say, I would say, you know, all told going through the schedule again, only four of the panels we ran were bullshit.

471
00:24:51,862 --> 00:24:55,092
Speaker 0: So 19 real panels that were just us.

472
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:58,846
Speaker 0: How many of the, how many of the real panels are basically just show videos?

473
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:01,639
Speaker 1: Don't do anything now that, well, what do you mean by that?

474
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,354
Speaker 1: I mean, is the craziest anime deaths any less of a panel than bite-sized anime.

475
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:10,953
Speaker 0: bite-sized anime was mostly a sit there, don't say much, just show videos panel.

476
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:16,478
Speaker 0: So is anime as crazy as deaths, anime as crazy as deaths requires you to actually describe in great detail.

477
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:19,751
Speaker 0: The deaths, this bite-sized anime doesn't require as much.

478
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:22,302
Speaker 1: You really need to describe the anime as crazy as death.

479
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:24,292
Speaker 1: When you've just shown someone getting killed.

480
00:25:24,312 --> 00:25:27,447
Speaker 0: People don't know what it was from, and it's not in the proper context.

481
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:30,120
Speaker 0: They don't know who's dying and why it was bite-sized anime.

482
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,250
Speaker 1: We talked a lot about Damaic Adobe or two.

483
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,642
Speaker 0: We talked enough about Damaic Adobe with Detroit metal.

484
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:37,518
Speaker 1: We said all there was to say, I don't know why you're so down in these panels.

485
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:44,040
Speaker 0: That was like, I just want to get a real count of, you know, how many panels were super for real panel.

486
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,186
Speaker 1: Well, what do you mean super for real?

487
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:47,719
Speaker 0: What's like, we actually had to talk for the whole time.

488
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,773
Speaker 1: So do we want to call that something different from a panel then?

489
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:56,436
Speaker 1: Because a panel is a panel as opposed to a showing, which is no commentary, just to show accurate picture.

490
00:25:56,877 --> 00:25:59,244
Speaker 0: We sponsored how much effort we exerted.

491
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:07,183
Speaker 1: We exerted a lot of effort, 37 panels that we scheduled and put Friday.

492
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:17,183
Speaker 0: Since we were the only ones who took the day off and went there Friday and everyone else showed up Friday night or Saturday, we pretty much sat in one room, running panels all day, doing nothing else.

493
00:26:17,223 --> 00:26:19,475
Speaker 0: I didn't even leave the room for a long period of time.

494
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,103
Speaker 0: I didn't go to the dealer's room.

495
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:22,510
Speaker 0: I didn't go to the artist's alley.

496
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:23,916
Speaker 0: I didn't go to any of the panels.

497
00:26:24,198 --> 00:26:25,404
Speaker 0: I didn't play any games.

498
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,520
Speaker 1: I went to many of those things because I barely even got to eat any food.

499
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:30,912
Speaker 1: I was able to walk around and take care of stuff.

500
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:40,573
Speaker 1: So I went and helped someone set up in the dealer's room and I saw the dealer's room and I went to the, like, I basically went everywhere in the con, but we basically were in panel five running panels from like 9 a.m.

501
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:41,897
Speaker 1: until midnight.

502
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,423
Speaker 0: Uh, it was pretty rough.

503
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:49,563
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna, I'm gonna read all the titles quickly once just to get a scale of this.

504
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:51,514
Speaker 1: Good morning, Kineticon bite-sized anime.

505
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:52,197
Speaker 1: Losing should be fun.

506
00:26:52,217 --> 00:26:59,502
Speaker 1: Beyond Dungeons Dragons, the Beyond Dungeons Dragons QA conceptual game design action castle, which was actually not run by us.

507
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:03,356
Speaker 1: Kineticon lives, Roving the Mecha Attack by Uncle Yo, not run by us.

508
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:09,064
Speaker 1: Beyond County Land, Comics for the Margarita, Tales from the Anime Club, Anime Openers, Leiji Matsumoto's, Galaxy Express, 3-9-9.

509
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,190
Speaker 0: Some notable things.

510
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,092
Speaker 1: Well, I guess 3-9.

511
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:13,957
Speaker 1: Some notable things from that.

512
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:14,018
Speaker 1: 3-9-9.

513
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:16,385
Speaker 0: Yes, notables.

514
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,895
Speaker 0: I just, I don't care about the chronological order.

515
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:21,143
Speaker 0: I just, I just try to remember, keep that all in my head.

516
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:25,079
Speaker 1: Well, I gotta say this bite-sized anime was pretty popular.

517
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,460
Speaker 1: One, because there wasn't much else going on at the time, but two, I've learned something.

518
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:38,351
Speaker 1: No one out there has seen Dameka Dobutsu or Detroit Metal City or Gog Manga or any of this stuff, but everyone loves all of these shows.

519
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:47,980
Speaker 1: The only mistake we made in this panel was that we showed Gog Manga Biore, Detroit Metal City and Dameka Dobutsu before we showed Zenryoku Usagi.

520
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,765
Speaker 0: Because Zenryoku Usagi first.

521
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:51,812
Speaker 1: Well, Zenryoku Usagi is awesome.

522
00:27:52,274 --> 00:27:56,727
Speaker 1: It is not quite as crazily awesome as Dameka Dobutsu.

523
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:01,738
Speaker 1: But I got to say, people really liked Gog Manga Biore.

524
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:05,897
Speaker 1: That show is like, but it's a show where people, people don't get it at first.

525
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:07,646
Speaker 1: Like you could see the audience and they're watching.

526
00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:09,738
Speaker 1: And for the first two minutes, they just don't get it.

527
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:11,303
Speaker 1: They're like, eh, what's this?

528
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:11,965
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

529
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:12,708
Speaker 1: What's going on?

530
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:20,417
Speaker 1: But then like the three punch joke at the end with the kid and the sticker and the peeling, the sticker, and then that they're done.

531
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:21,060
Speaker 0: Yep.

532
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,142
Speaker 0: So first of all, Beyond Candyland, this is something to talk about because it's a brand new panel.

533
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:30,773
Speaker 0: We basically practiced it at at Kineticon.

534
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:33,923
Speaker 0: It is four packs, four packs in like a month.

535
00:28:34,104 --> 00:28:34,365
Speaker 0: Right.

536
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:36,933
Speaker 1: So not even it is exactly a day weekend.

537
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:37,214
Speaker 0: Right.

538
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:43,177
Speaker 0: So we practiced it at Kineticon and I basically slapped it together real quick, like a week or two ago.

539
00:28:43,197 --> 00:28:45,946
Speaker 0: And we just did it and we didn't prepare that much.

540
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:50,260
Speaker 0: But it was actually way, way, way better than I anticipated.

541
00:28:50,602 --> 00:28:53,153
Speaker 0: Like it doesn't need that much more polished for packs.

542
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:54,117
Speaker 0: It's like ready to go.

543
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:57,818
Speaker 1: It's definitely a panel that writes itself because the first half is kind of tough to figure out.

544
00:28:57,838 --> 00:29:06,316
Speaker 1: You know, we, we debated as Scott was throwing together the slideshow before Kineticon, like, you know, two days before Kineticon, like, you know, should we talk about this than this?

545
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,120
Speaker 1: What's the idea?

546
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:08,506
Speaker 1: Should we bring up game theory?

547
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:13,347
Speaker 0: I just got to reorder a few slides that are sort of out of order and this panel be pretty great.

548
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:24,995
Speaker 1: after that, like after we get all the theory and like stuff out the whole second half of the panel, once Scott figured out the order of board games to talk about, it is just like it was gold before we even gave it.

549
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:28,929
Speaker 1: Like, it's just so easy to talk about Puerto Rico and Tigers and Euphrates.

550
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:29,390
Speaker 0: Yep.

551
00:29:29,491 --> 00:29:36,197
Speaker 0: So if you're going to packs or any other convention, this is a brand new panel, which means it's going to be a whole year before it expires.

552
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:45,004
Speaker 0: So if you go to see us, you know, anytime in like two thou, you know, between, uh, you know, before Kineticon 2010, I can list.

553
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:55,139
Speaker 1: if you're going to go to either Penny Arcade Expo or the New York Comic Con or Anime Boston, we'll probably run into Anime Boston too, but we're going to run it at a lot of places.

554
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:55,801
Speaker 0: Yep.

555
00:29:55,861 --> 00:30:00,099
Speaker 0: So look forwards to Beyond Candyland, an awesome panel about awesome board games.

556
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:01,665
Speaker 0: that has nothing to do with anime.

557
00:30:01,725 --> 00:30:03,091
Speaker 0: Sorry, Anime Boston.

558
00:30:03,312 --> 00:30:04,536
Speaker 0: I hope we'll see what happens.

559
00:30:04,797 --> 00:30:05,038
Speaker 1: Yeah.

560
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:10,516
Speaker 1: The thing is Beyond D&D was like our biggest panel at both Anime Boston and at Otakon.

561
00:30:10,656 --> 00:30:11,900
Speaker 0: I know it's sad.

562
00:30:12,262 --> 00:30:12,403
Speaker 1: Yeah.

563
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,380
Speaker 1: But we ran that again and we actually did a Q and a, and that worked pretty well.

564
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:25,593
Speaker 1: I definitely have to point out action castle because we got Lou Crane and Jared Sorensen to come to Kineticon, which it was, it was remarkably difficult.

565
00:30:25,613 --> 00:30:27,862
Speaker 0: Like I was a miracle that we got them to show up.

566
00:30:27,983 --> 00:30:41,252
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm glad, you know, I thank them for coming and staying as long as they stayed and doing what they did, but, you know, just to be perfectly honest, you know, Jared basically showed up, did his thing real quick and then he was gone.

567
00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:41,593
Speaker 1: Yep.

568
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,700
Speaker 1: But to his credit, he showed up.

569
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,853
Speaker 1: Basically I gave him a schedule that was a half hour off.

570
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:50,250
Speaker 0: That was because rim's fault, because that's why I didn't say he showed up late.

571
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,064
Speaker 0: Cause rim messed that up telling him the wrong time to show up.

572
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:57,770
Speaker 1: Well, because the schedule, the Kineticon schedule, you know, since we're in charge of this next year, we're going to rework how it looks.

573
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:04,980
Speaker 1: But basically I gave everyone the schedule exactly a half hour off and Jared was incommunicado completely just off the face of the earth.

574
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:06,044
Speaker 1: Luke didn't even know where he was.

575
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:11,826
Speaker 1: And exactly the second I had told him to show up, he'd like, he just appears in the room.

576
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:20,760
Speaker 1: So for the first half of conceptual game design, I had to make up the conceptual game design panel because Scott, uh, Scott couldn't deliver.

577
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,070
Speaker 1: Scott couldn't come up with a panel on the fly.

578
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:26,843
Speaker 0: I wasn't going to steal someone else's panel and I was tired and I didn't give a shit.

579
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:29,649
Speaker 0: Plus, you know, you left me hanging in the morning.

580
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:37,651
Speaker 0: You're it was a lot more than 10 minutes actually.

581
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:40,261
Speaker 1: Cause I have the tweets that were going out and the text messages.

582
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:41,125
Speaker 1: I know the minute.

583
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,008
Speaker 1: I was back in that room.

584
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:45,179
Speaker 1: I can go look, but beyond, beyond.

585
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:47,371
Speaker 1: good morning, Kineticon, how hard is good morning?

586
00:31:47,391 --> 00:31:49,803
Speaker 1: Kineticon you say good morning, Kineticon that you sit there.

587
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:51,411
Speaker 0: I basically did the whole thing.

588
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:54,064
Speaker 0: And then you showed up and repeated everything I had already done.

589
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:54,326
Speaker 0: Yeah.

590
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:54,809
Speaker 1: And you know what?

591
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,956
Speaker 1: The crowd seemed to really like that.

592
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:57,222
Speaker 1: Anyway, they did.

593
00:31:57,302 --> 00:32:02,963
Speaker 1: But I think I came up with a pretty good 10 minute conceptual game design panel and crowd liked it.

594
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:07,600
Speaker 0: I believe Scott got anything better than sitting there doing nothing.

595
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,853
Speaker 0: I could have gotten up and just did the elephant dance.

596
00:32:09,873 --> 00:32:10,739
Speaker 0: They would have loved that too.

597
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,259
Speaker 1: So, uh, well they, I don't think they could have told her it was an elephant dance.

598
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:17,307
Speaker 0: It depends on the crowd anyway.

599
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:18,009
Speaker 1: Anyway.

600
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,692
Speaker 1: So yeah.

601
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:18,993
Speaker 0: Yeah.

602
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:23,274
Speaker 0: We ran action castle and he ran it just like he ran it at packs and it was totally awesome.

603
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:31,153
Speaker 1: One thing I can say though, like people didn't know what to expect and the whole con people are asking us ahead of time, like what is, what is people kept asking us?

604
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:32,137
Speaker 0: What's action castle.

605
00:32:32,177 --> 00:32:32,960
Speaker 0: What's crab people.

606
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,844
Speaker 0: What's action castle.

607
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:34,347
Speaker 0: What's crab.

608
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:36,137
Speaker 1: Let me tell you, we learned something.

609
00:32:36,197 --> 00:32:39,110
Speaker 1: If you make a description like that, people will show up.

610
00:32:39,492 --> 00:32:54,917
Speaker 1: And as long as you can deliver something that lives up to the description, even if it does not match the description, your goal, but action castle, by the end of it, like the crowd was so like crazy about it, that the whole con, it was like this joke and people around the count instead of butt, scotch.

611
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,364
Speaker 1: Ah, but scotch out.

612
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,520
Speaker 1: It was, it takes a long time.

613
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:10,697
Speaker 1: Action castle is going to be like a big event at Connecticut next year.

614
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:12,320
Speaker 0: We got to get Jared roped.

615
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:20,281
Speaker 0: We got to like, I don't know, maybe we have to like, uh, what do we have to do to get these people to like stay and keep doing stuff the way we got scheduled in for more things for one and two.

616
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:28,672
Speaker 1: Now we know the trouble, the peril, the melancholy of Jim bowls, because think about what he has to wrangle at Otacon in terms of guests.

617
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:29,235
Speaker 0: I know.

618
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:31,626
Speaker 1: Imagine the Connecticut and guest relations people.

619
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:36,888
Speaker 1: They have to deal with people like Vic and Chris, you know, why are people so unfreaking reliable?

620
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:39,139
Speaker 0: Someone tells you to show up a time you show up.

621
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:40,003
Speaker 1: How was the unravel?

622
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:41,491
Speaker 1: He showed up at exactly that time.

623
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,301
Speaker 1: And we did not schedule him for anything else.

624
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,647
Speaker 1: So he did not show up any other time.

625
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:51,382
Speaker 0: He was not obligated to, it was not obligated to, but it's like, you know, if he would have ran some, you know, he could have sold a whole bunch of games.

626
00:33:51,442 --> 00:33:54,275
Speaker 0: If he would have just run some demos, but he didn't want to.

627
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:56,004
Speaker 1: And we did not obligate him to, I did not.

628
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,130
Speaker 1: I've learned something.

629
00:33:57,532 --> 00:34:00,486
Speaker 1: I learned something very important because this is how all the other people do it.

630
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:10,165
Speaker 1: If you give someone an itinerary, they will show up to everything in that itinerary, unless they get drunk and wander off like an unnamed voice actor at Katsu con a few years ago.

631
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:14,100
Speaker 0: Well, we're going to have to give everyone strict itineraries.

632
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,036
Speaker 1: The thing is, I point out, everyone showed up to their itineraries perfectly.

633
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:21,929
Speaker 1: That's true, but you know, I don't know what you're complaining about.

634
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,280
Speaker 1: Jared ran action castle and it was epic.

635
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,603
Speaker 0: It was epic.

636
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:29,239
Speaker 0: There's no, no complaint we can have about his running of action castle.

637
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:31,246
Speaker 0: It just, you know, it would have been nice to chat.

638
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:34,862
Speaker 1: Well, from what I hear, he had some business to take care of.

639
00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:35,806
Speaker 1: that was somewhat personal.

640
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:36,550
Speaker 1: So I can't get into that.

641
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:42,976
Speaker 1: He had, he had a good reason to not be around for the rest of the con, but Luke Crane was around the creator of burning wheel.

642
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:48,159
Speaker 1: And the one thing I want to say about that, that's kind of meta is that I could see it in his eyes.

643
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:59,223
Speaker 0: It's very different to be at a con like kinetic con as opposed to a gaming con because most of the cons he goes through the tiny gaming cons though, the Uber cons, the decks, cons, you know, all that sort of thing.

644
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,689
Speaker 1: Like packs, which is packs.

645
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:09,903
Speaker 1: It's something special, but he basically, one of our friends texted me and he's like, Luke went into the rave and I'm like, I wonder how that's going to turn out.

646
00:35:10,284 --> 00:35:20,199
Speaker 1: So he walks out of the raise rave and on record, the first words that were out of his mouth were basically there are girls at this convention and there's music.

647
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how pretty much every convention I go to it.

648
00:35:24,033 --> 00:35:30,831
Speaker 1: I think he had this revelation that cons like this are very, very different and they take a long time.

649
00:35:30,892 --> 00:35:38,691
Speaker 0: And this convention was, you and you know, only half of it was anime maybe.

650
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:39,072
Speaker 0: Yeah.

651
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:42,803
Speaker 0: So I wonder what he would do it in a full anime convention.

652
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:47,399
Speaker 1: Luckily uncle yo showed up on Friday because you know, he does con stuff.

653
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:51,920
Speaker 1: So surviving the Mecca attack was standing room only and it was just, it was absolutely fantastic.

654
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,667
Speaker 0: Uncle yo, he just keeps improving though.

655
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:54,350
Speaker 0: His skills.

656
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,228
Speaker 0: every time it's like just every time we see him at a con, he's doing his thing.

657
00:35:58,248 --> 00:35:59,897
Speaker 0: He's just getting better and better and better.

658
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:07,855
Speaker 0: I wandered into the end of surviving the Mecca and he's, he's proved if you work, if you want something and you'd keep doing it and keep doing it, you just get better at it.

659
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:11,371
Speaker 0: I know he's going to reach his 10,000 hours of practice and you better watch out.

660
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:11,793
Speaker 1: Yes.

661
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:13,400
Speaker 1: Is the pendulate method of success.

662
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:13,881
Speaker 1: And you know what?

663
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:16,148
Speaker 1: It's pretty much proven at this point.

664
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:21,504
Speaker 0: I mean, bill Gates, us pendulate pendulate uncle.

665
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:26,222
Speaker 1: yo, if you want to be like any of these people, all you have to do is ruin the early half of your life.

666
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,997
Speaker 0: Just keep doing something a whole bunch and you'll get good at it.

667
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:30,559
Speaker 0: Naturally.

668
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,690
Speaker 1: Well, you also actually have to want it.

669
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,981
Speaker 1: If you don't want it, you're not going to pull up that pigeon, man.

670
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:37,590
Speaker 0: I walked by a pigeon today near the post office.

671
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:40,300
Speaker 0: It was the fattest, slowest pigeon.

672
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:42,446
Speaker 0: I was like, Oh, fuck you.

673
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,410
Speaker 0: I could have had you.

674
00:36:43,431 --> 00:36:46,344
Speaker 0: I'm going to, the only reason I don't do it is I don't have gloves.

675
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:48,599
Speaker 0: I swear to God, I'm going to get some fucking gloves from home Depot.

676
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:51,074
Speaker 0: I'm going to pick up so many fricking pigeons, but here's the thing.

677
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:52,923
Speaker 0: I'm going to put them in sack too.

678
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:54,388
Speaker 0: They're not this big sack.

679
00:36:54,428 --> 00:36:55,773
Speaker 0: It's just flopping around like a cartoon.

680
00:36:55,793 --> 00:37:04,293
Speaker 1: That's the analogy to everyone who says they're going to do a web comic or says they're going to make an e-commerce video of all these pigeons in a sack.

681
00:37:04,313 --> 00:37:07,204
Speaker 0: Then I'm going to go in the park and dump them out on somebody.

682
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:17,318
Speaker 1: For those of you who are unaware very briefly, because I know we have a lot of new listeners from Connecticut and explaining these sort of things takes a long time.

683
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:18,743
Speaker 0: Last time we use that joke.

684
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:19,426
Speaker 1: Are you kidding?

685
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,213
Speaker 1: I don't think you understand.

686
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:23,061
Speaker 0: It's not, it's not really a holding up.

687
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:23,763
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

688
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:24,767
Speaker 1: I keep making the joke.

689
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,899
Speaker 1: Anyway, pendulate and teller, you know, pen and teller.

690
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,501
Speaker 1: They're trying to do this magic trick where they have to like grab a dove and they did well in a park.

691
00:37:33,581 --> 00:37:35,329
Speaker 1: They were doing doves in central park.

692
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:36,836
Speaker 1: They had specially trained doves.

693
00:37:36,957 --> 00:37:39,066
Speaker 0: No, I'm pretty sure it was a pigeon in central park.

694
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:42,020
Speaker 1: You clearly do not remember the story as you tend to not remember.

695
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:49,428
Speaker 1: So they had to do a bit where they had to grab doves, which are basically just tame, pretty looking pigeons in terms of demeanor.

696
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:54,425
Speaker 1: So they're trying to do this and they can't, like they can't grab them.

697
00:37:54,465 --> 00:37:58,869
Speaker 1: Like they're like, they're having all this trouble and they're getting frustrated with these trained birds.

698
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:04,257
Speaker 1: and pen just wanders away and he's sitting in the park and he's frustrated and sees his pigeon and he's thinking about it.

699
00:38:04,277 --> 00:38:04,860
Speaker 1: He's like, you know what?

700
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,324
Speaker 1: I want that pigeon.

701
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:07,008
Speaker 1: I just, I want it.

702
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:07,490
Speaker 1: I want it.

703
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:07,973
Speaker 1: I want it.

704
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:08,415
Speaker 1: I want it.

705
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:08,877
Speaker 1: I want it.

706
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:09,319
Speaker 1: I want it.

707
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,025
Speaker 1: And he just went and grabbed it.

708
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,579
Speaker 1: And he realized suddenly that you just have to want it.

709
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,893
Speaker 1: And up until that point, he did not want the bird in his hand.

710
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:22,185
Speaker 1: He did not actually fully with his heart and viscerally want it.

711
00:38:22,788 --> 00:38:23,792
Speaker 1: So he didn't, he couldn't pick it up.

712
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:25,078
Speaker 1: He didn't have the guts.

713
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,134
Speaker 1: He didn't have the girl in the gun, but if he wanted it, he fucking wanted it.

714
00:38:29,154 --> 00:38:31,965
Speaker 0: So you put your hands towards a pigeon, right?

715
00:38:32,025 --> 00:38:33,130
Speaker 0: Even if it's clean, it's like.

716
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,753
Speaker 0: you hesitate.

717
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:34,376
Speaker 0: You're like, Ew.

718
00:38:34,677 --> 00:38:36,204
Speaker 0: And you think about holding it in your hand.

719
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:37,068
Speaker 0: It's like, Ew.

720
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:43,490
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, it's, you don't really want to hold it, but if you want to hold it, nothing is stopping you.

721
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:45,697
Speaker 0: That's why lion eats man.

722
00:38:45,777 --> 00:38:49,788
Speaker 0: Cause lion wants to eat man, but man doesn't want to eat lion.

723
00:38:52,474 --> 00:38:56,493
Speaker 0: So if you wanted to eat the lion and you are, you know, strong, you're ambitious enough.

724
00:38:56,553 --> 00:38:57,400
Speaker 0: You could probably take it out.

725
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,295
Speaker 0: You'd get on that lion's back, bite him in the throat, rip his whatnot.

726
00:39:02,436 --> 00:39:04,042
Speaker 1: Not everybody can be good.

727
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:13,853
Speaker 1: No, but yeah, some people, but anyway, I want it to the end of uncle, uncle Joe and George surviving the Mecca attack because we had beyond candy land next.

728
00:39:14,355 --> 00:39:15,280
Speaker 1: And I caught this bit.

729
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:20,360
Speaker 1: that was basically, do you understand how much it costs to run an Atano circus?

730
00:39:21,561 --> 00:39:22,887
Speaker 1: Here's the cost of one missile.

731
00:39:23,249 --> 00:39:25,520
Speaker 1: And I had this idea and I hope they incorporate it too.

732
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:33,348
Speaker 1: They need a video of like Mac, like some sort of Atano circus show and just have the digital counter in the bottom of how much it costs.

733
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:35,293
Speaker 0: That'd be good.

734
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:36,116
Speaker 0: Very good.

735
00:39:36,136 --> 00:39:38,324
Speaker 0: Takes a lot of video editing skills though.

736
00:39:38,685 --> 00:39:42,742
Speaker 1: And we tried out another panel late at night and I'm real pleased with this panel.

737
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:50,900
Speaker 1: I just have to tweak it and, you know, replace the crab people versions of like the YouTube videos with DVD rips, but anime openers and closers from around the world.

738
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,026
Speaker 0: We need a few more foreign ones.

739
00:39:53,347 --> 00:39:55,574
Speaker 0: We did a lot of Japan, America comparisons.

740
00:39:55,835 --> 00:40:00,432
Speaker 0: We only did a handful of a European and otherwise comparison.

741
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:01,215
Speaker 1: I had quite a few of.

742
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:09,026
Speaker 1: the problem is there aren't that many except for shown in fighting shows that remember an anime only has its own to get some Hokuto Ken from around the world.

743
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:11,134
Speaker 0: You are shocked.

744
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:11,937
Speaker 1: There's not that much.

745
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:12,599
Speaker 1: I was looking around.

746
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:21,650
Speaker 1: Most people didn't dub it or I can't get it because remember for stuff that's weird like that, I'm basically reliant on YouTube and possibly better.

747
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:23,958
Speaker 1: And luckily I met some people.

748
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:31,649
Speaker 1: One guy showed me this opener to something and he's going to send me a copy of it to incorporate into the panel, but I had some good stuff.

749
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:36,047
Speaker 0: I found that good, a DuckTales thing and Chinese Ava was a good new highlight.

750
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:36,670
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

751
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,293
Speaker 1: Chinese Ava.

752
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,668
Speaker 1: I got to try to find a better copy, but I searched for days and that's the best I could find.

753
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:41,330
Speaker 1: Damn.

754
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:48,916
Speaker 1: People were very surprised by Fox bot Escaflowne because no one expected that actually.

755
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:49,959
Speaker 0: what was scary about that?

756
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:50,300
Speaker 0: panels.

757
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,661
Speaker 0: We kept showing like the horrible openers and people actually sort of wanted to watch some of them.

758
00:40:55,701 --> 00:40:59,174
Speaker 0: Like we, we, we put on, you know, got to go, got to go one piece.

759
00:40:59,696 --> 00:41:03,292
Speaker 0: And Luke Crane was actually like, Hey, when we stopped it, like he wanted to see the rest of it.

760
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:08,778
Speaker 1: Well, I, cause Luke Crane is one of those people who grew up on, you know, the star blazers equivalent.

761
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:12,612
Speaker 0: So he, he basically, he grew up on Bandai Robot Champs.

762
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:15,244
Speaker 1: He's one of those people who probably, and I see this a lot.

763
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:20,309
Speaker 1: They kind of got into anime back then, but then they fall out of it because there was no more anime like that available.

764
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:20,871
Speaker 0: Yep.

765
00:41:21,414 --> 00:41:25,031
Speaker 1: And I feel like people like that could get back into watching those old Mecca openers.

766
00:41:25,071 --> 00:41:26,136
Speaker 0: He's like, I own that one.

767
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:27,040
Speaker 0: I'm like, Oh shit.

768
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:27,962
Speaker 1: Yeah.

769
00:41:29,165 --> 00:41:30,609
Speaker 0: Like a grand dizer in your basement.

770
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,071
Speaker 0: Yep.

771
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:35,162
Speaker 1: And he's, you know, I knew lion on the chest shoots a laser.

772
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:36,306
Speaker 1: I did not know.

773
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,617
Speaker 1: Lion's eyes also shoot laser, different laser.

774
00:41:39,658 --> 00:41:41,403
Speaker 1: The two lasers can also combine.

775
00:41:41,663 --> 00:41:42,004
Speaker 0: Wow.

776
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:42,786
Speaker 0: Yeah.

777
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,691
Speaker 1: All right.

778
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:46,115
Speaker 1: All right.

779
00:41:46,135 --> 00:41:47,879
Speaker 1: Kineticon live was kind of a BS panel.

780
00:41:47,899 --> 00:41:50,731
Speaker 1: We threw that into just to, you know, kill an hour.

781
00:41:51,293 --> 00:41:52,880
Speaker 0: We're actually going to put that up as an episode.

782
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,748
Speaker 1: I probably will because you know what?

783
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,185
Speaker 1: The crowd, there was a pretty experimental or supplemental feeders.

784
00:41:58,245 --> 00:42:03,348
Speaker 1: I'm going to put everything I recorded in the experimental feed, mostly on edited, but people see an idea.

785
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:07,947
Speaker 1: One thing I noticed are so-called BS panels where we were to basically sit there and kind of make up a panel.

786
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:13,007
Speaker 1: as we went, we'd have between 40 and 80 people in the room and they seem to really like it.

787
00:42:13,088 --> 00:42:13,891
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird.

788
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:15,719
Speaker 0: People pretty much liked it.

789
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:16,000
Speaker 0: Basically.

790
00:42:16,562 --> 00:42:19,294
Speaker 0: It felt like a lot of this stuff we did at Kineticon.

791
00:42:19,334 --> 00:42:23,010
Speaker 0: It's like we just reuse the same materials over and over again, sort of remix them.

792
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:29,120
Speaker 0: You know, we tell the same joke like five times a day, but the crowd was always slightly different with only a few people that had been there.

793
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:35,769
Speaker 1: But it works really well because one, like a comedy routine, you know, you make the joke and then you build on it periodically throughout the routine.

794
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:38,983
Speaker 1: And then you end on the original joke and bring it full circle.

795
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,130
Speaker 0: Yes, but that's not what we did.

796
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:45,195
Speaker 0: What we did was tell the exact same joke pretty much like three times a day to three different groups of people.

797
00:42:45,215 --> 00:42:45,436
Speaker 0: But it'd

798
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:46,119
Speaker 1: be interesting, but

799
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,727
Speaker 0: luckily the group had such a small

800
00:42:47,848 --> 00:42:48,290
Speaker 1: overlap

801
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:50,822
Speaker 0: that there weren't too many people complaining that, you

802
00:42:50,842 --> 00:42:59,057
Speaker 1: know, I heard that the few people who were there because, you know, we'd use the joke in a different context or we'd reference an anecdote, but we wouldn't fully explain it.

803
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:06,364
Speaker 1: But you'd see, like there was that one kind of front row gang in the lower, like right half of the panel room that was there like all day.

804
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:09,519
Speaker 1: And they would like not at each other and be like, yeah, yeah.

805
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:12,029
Speaker 1: Whenever we referenced an anecdote from a previous panel.

806
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:12,692
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

807
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:13,354
Speaker 0: Yeah.

808
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:19,984
Speaker 0: Plus anyone who's going to come to our panels that frequently, like someone who was there all day, those are the kind of people who are like our big fans.

809
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:25,264
Speaker 0: And we could just sit up there going boobity boobity boobity, but they just be like, whee.

810
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:29,416
Speaker 0: So whatever, you know, they'll take whatever we're going to say anyway.

811
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:33,609
Speaker 0: Any other exciting panels we ran on Friday?

812
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:46,813
Speaker 1: Well, we also tried out losing should be fun, which is the much more difficult to write panel for packs because I very much sold it to a lot of people and it's more of a conceptual panel.

813
00:43:46,894 --> 00:43:49,382
Speaker 0: It just needs a little bit more polished, like a double pot.

814
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:53,399
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, I realize I rewrote it and I think it's almost done.

815
00:43:53,419 --> 00:43:55,911
Speaker 1: I just have to get the pictures to fill in the new slideshow.

816
00:43:55,991 --> 00:44:02,052
Speaker 1: But what I realized about losing should be fun is that it's primarily theory and explanation.

817
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,379
Speaker 1: And it doesn't have the fallback of.

818
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,270
Speaker 1: here are 10 great games and why they're great.

819
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,996
Speaker 1: Yeah, because there aren't games.

820
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:10,081
Speaker 0: Beyond DND has the.

821
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:13,376
Speaker 0: here are the indie RPGs you should play and Beyond Candyland has.

822
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:14,220
Speaker 0: here are board games.

823
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,655
Speaker 1: Losing should be fun has UFO 5440 and Dwarf Fortress.

824
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:22,833
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know, we should get some natural selection in there and, you know, some other games.

825
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:23,436
Speaker 1: They're in there.

826
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:27,789
Speaker 1: Mostly I need, you know, I basically need to add more.

827
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:31,018
Speaker 0: You get a video of turtling and NS to put in there.

828
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:33,087
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah, we could try to get that.

829
00:44:33,127 --> 00:44:34,695
Speaker 1: We got time like an audio list.

830
00:44:34,776 --> 00:44:35,600
Speaker 0: video of turtling.

831
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,452
Speaker 1: The audio might be good too, though, because you'll get that same guy.

832
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:39,055
Speaker 1: Yeah.

833
00:44:39,216 --> 00:44:39,558
Speaker 1: Yeah.

834
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:39,900
Speaker 1: Get him.

835
00:44:40,502 --> 00:44:42,491
Speaker 0: If he's playing, that's definitely the video to keep.

836
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:43,918
Speaker 1: I got to contact that guy.

837
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:44,922
Speaker 1: I alien commander.

838
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:45,444
Speaker 0: Yeah.

839
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:46,668
Speaker 0: Alien commander.

840
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:48,053
Speaker 0: Do LSD once in your life.

841
00:44:48,093 --> 00:44:48,474
Speaker 1: Yeah.

842
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:53,775
Speaker 1: If anyone out there knows alien commander in natural selection, it's not a big community.

843
00:44:53,835 --> 00:44:54,980
Speaker 1: Someone knows him personally.

844
00:44:55,941 --> 00:44:56,302
Speaker 1: Yeah.

845
00:44:56,383 --> 00:44:56,805
Speaker 1: Let us know.

846
00:44:56,845 --> 00:44:57,889
Speaker 1: I want to get him on the show.

847
00:44:57,909 --> 00:44:58,411
Speaker 1: Yeah.

848
00:44:58,732 --> 00:44:59,556
Speaker 1: I want to ask him.

849
00:44:59,736 --> 00:45:02,707
Speaker 0: Speaking of which at unknown worlds is going to have a booth.

850
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:04,034
Speaker 0: We're going to get to meet the flare.

851
00:45:04,054 --> 00:45:05,240
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

852
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,302
Speaker 0: We got to add it.

853
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:06,965
Speaker 0: All right.

854
00:45:06,985 --> 00:45:08,952
Speaker 0: More likely he's going to get to meet us.

855
00:45:09,514 --> 00:45:09,754
Speaker 0: All right.

856
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:11,340
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

857
00:45:12,604 --> 00:45:13,408
Speaker 0: You know what I'm going to do?

858
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,945
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask if we can get a press badge in addition to our special guest badge.

859
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:18,790
Speaker 0: Good idea.

860
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,985
Speaker 1: Because the press bet and the special guest badge, it's kind of like paranoia.

861
00:45:22,005 --> 00:45:28,449
Speaker 1: It gets you into weird places, but it's weird to try to interview someone with that badge.

862
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,920
Speaker 1: Interviewing someone who has the same badge, you do kind of weird.

863
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:32,924
Speaker 0: Very weird.

864
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:34,532
Speaker 1: We got to get a different badge.

865
00:45:34,552 --> 00:45:37,146
Speaker 0: They're going to have exhibitor professional type badges probably.

866
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:39,297
Speaker 0: That's weird because we industry badge.

867
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:42,552
Speaker 1: I don't know what they know because a lot of the guests had the same badge we had last year.

868
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:43,638
Speaker 0: Oh, well, yeah.

869
00:45:43,698 --> 00:45:53,635
Speaker 0: Get, I mean, you know, uh, like, uh, yeah, the bad, the badge we had last year was what, like special, it was special, like presenters presenters, something like that.

870
00:45:53,696 --> 00:45:53,937
Speaker 0: Yeah.

871
00:45:54,037 --> 00:45:54,559
Speaker 1: It was blue.

872
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:54,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

873
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,496
Speaker 0: That was the same badge that like, you know, MC Frontalot had or whatever.

874
00:45:57,677 --> 00:45:57,958
Speaker 0: Right.

875
00:45:57,999 --> 00:46:00,069
Speaker 0: You know, it's the someone's doing events badge.

876
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:00,693
Speaker 0: That's what we had.

877
00:46:00,773 --> 00:46:03,966
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's, that's a good badge to have anyway.

878
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:11,795
Speaker 1: Uh, one other, you know, outside of panel five, this, this con review is very meta as opposed to our, you know, normally a convention review.

879
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:14,469
Speaker 1: We talk a lot about, you know, all the events at the con.

880
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:15,715
Speaker 1: We went to this, we did this.

881
00:46:15,735 --> 00:46:16,540
Speaker 0: We didn't go to much.

882
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:17,745
Speaker 1: We didn't go to anything.

883
00:46:17,805 --> 00:46:22,705
Speaker 1: And also it's a miracle that we played two board games because we're basically staff at Connecticut.

884
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:31,135
Speaker 1: At this point, our Connecticut reviews, uh, hopefully you'll find this stuff interesting, are very inside baseball, what it's like

885
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:33,846
Speaker 0: when the back looking out instead of the outlook and in, which is

886
00:46:33,906 --> 00:46:46,116
Speaker 1: one of those things that we always really, really like to see because the first time we sat in like an artist's alley or like talk to dealers for real, it's weird how any fan convention has like these 10 different perspectives.

887
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:50,517
Speaker 1: And depending on who you are and what badge you have, it is a completely different experience.

888
00:46:50,537 --> 00:46:51,120
Speaker 1: to go to the con.

889
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,501
Speaker 0: Yep.

890
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:57,572
Speaker 0: I think it's actually good for us to do the review like this from the back to the front, because, you know, there's a million con review podcasts.

891
00:46:57,592 --> 00:46:58,215
Speaker 0: We've done them.

892
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,907
Speaker 0: Our fellow friendly podcasters have done a hundred of them.

893
00:47:00,947 --> 00:47:01,209
Speaker 0: Right.

894
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,459
Speaker 0: And they're all sort of very similar.

895
00:47:03,479 --> 00:47:05,527
Speaker 0: You know, this, we went to these panels, they were good.

896
00:47:05,547 --> 00:47:06,651
Speaker 0: They were bad, right.

897
00:47:07,635 --> 00:47:11,171
Speaker 0: Doing one for the back to the front, I think is a lot rarer thing.

898
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:15,629
Speaker 0: You're not going to hear a lot of these out in the podcasting world or just in the world in general.

899
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:15,931
Speaker 0: Right.

900
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:25,349
Speaker 0: Reviews of something from the back looking out, you don't hear like, you know, it's like a book review by the author, you know, or the editor of the book review by the author.

901
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,154
Speaker 1: This book's fucking awesome.

902
00:47:27,355 --> 00:47:27,615
Speaker 0: Right.

903
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:29,522
Speaker 0: But the thing is, right.

904
00:47:29,582 --> 00:47:33,284
Speaker 0: Imagine if there were like a hundred authors of the book, it wasn't, it was like an anthology.

905
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:37,161
Speaker 0: And one guy reviewed the whole thing, you know, his part, you know, he'll talk about.

906
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:42,568
Speaker 0: And the other thing is that I think people know and they trust us and that we're very honest, even about our own shit.

907
00:47:42,588 --> 00:47:46,166
Speaker 0: You know, we'll tell you when we do something that sucks, we'll be like, yeah, our shit suck there.

908
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:46,869
Speaker 1: We'll get to that.

909
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:57,025
Speaker 0: We had a couple of suckiness around, but what can, you know, considering the quantity versus the proportion of suck, we did pretty damn good.

910
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:57,487
Speaker 0: I think.

911
00:47:57,607 --> 00:47:58,190
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

912
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,274
Speaker 0: I mean, could you do better?

913
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:05,736
Speaker 0: If you can do better, if you think you can do better, you'll get your chance next, Connecticut.

914
00:48:05,937 --> 00:48:12,560
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that at the end, but very briefly, Scott and I are now the heads of panels and workshops for Connecticut.

915
00:48:13,161 --> 00:48:14,726
Speaker 1: It is us 100%.

916
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:15,930
Speaker 1: The buck stops with us.

917
00:48:16,231 --> 00:48:17,756
Speaker 1: Panels are our responsibility.

918
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:22,172
Speaker 1: So stay tuned to the end because we're already working on next Connecticut schedule.

919
00:48:22,453 --> 00:48:23,999
Speaker 1: I've already lined up some panels.

920
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:24,682
Speaker 1: Good God.

921
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:25,445
Speaker 1: Yep.

922
00:48:25,465 --> 00:48:27,453
Speaker 0: We're going to be already lined up my own panel.

923
00:48:27,674 --> 00:48:31,731
Speaker 1: I lined up, I lined up some external panels and you're, you guys are going to be surprised.

924
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:40,571
Speaker 0: I'm thinking maybe like if, you know, since we're running, we're both running the panels that like if we both did a panel, it actually might be sort of troublesome if we're needed.

925
00:48:40,993 --> 00:48:42,901
Speaker 0: Maybe we should do like some individual panels.

926
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:45,851
Speaker 1: There will be very few panels at Connecticut.

927
00:48:45,871 --> 00:48:54,084
Speaker 1: Sadly, for many of you who are fans of us that are both me and Scott, because that's kind of like putting the president and the vice president in the same room at the same time.

928
00:48:54,526 --> 00:48:55,007
Speaker 1: Very bad.

929
00:48:55,028 --> 00:48:55,329
Speaker 1: Yeah.

930
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:02,702
Speaker 1: So, but regardless, we'll talk about that at the end because that's the least interesting part to people who went to this Connecticut and want to care about it.

931
00:49:03,826 --> 00:49:13,628
Speaker 1: One thing I do want to point out to our last panel of the night, we were originally going to talk about and then show the galaxy express three nines movie, which is one of the greatest animated movies ever made.

932
00:49:13,648 --> 00:49:14,392
Speaker 1: There's this whole scene.

933
00:49:14,412 --> 00:49:15,719
Speaker 0: When do you want to watch it?

934
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:16,564
Speaker 0: You want to watch it tomorrow?

935
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:18,192
Speaker 0: Maybe tacos.

936
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:18,593
Speaker 1: Yeah.

937
00:49:18,634 --> 00:49:19,920
Speaker 1: Either that, or I kind of want to show her cause.

938
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,471
Speaker 1: I have that box set the first episode of Tyler.

939
00:49:22,531 --> 00:49:23,315
Speaker 0: You can watch that too.

940
00:49:23,495 --> 00:49:23,957
Speaker 0: Yeah.

941
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:24,379
Speaker 0: It's a good one.

942
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,380
Speaker 0: But we, yeah, rim bought the box set box set of irresponsible captain Tyler in the dealer's room.

943
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:30,406
Speaker 1: So excited about this.

944
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:31,714
Speaker 1: That's like my favorite anime ever.

945
00:49:31,754 --> 00:49:34,045
Speaker 1: I, you know, I talk about anime a lot.

946
00:49:34,086 --> 00:49:45,240
Speaker 1: I'm an anime fan, irresponsible captain Tyler, unlike any other anime or even media that I have read or seen it influenced my life pretty directly.

947
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:53,744
Speaker 1: And when I was young and I saw this show, I very seriously kind of based my life and my worldview on this anime.

948
00:49:54,566 --> 00:49:56,672
Speaker 0: I, uh, what did I, I bought?

949
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,200
Speaker 0: dread the Jenga RPG in the dealer's room.

950
00:49:59,440 --> 00:49:59,702
Speaker 0: Yeah.

951
00:49:59,722 --> 00:50:02,497
Speaker 1: I ordered Jenga on Amazon because we don't already order it.

952
00:50:02,597 --> 00:50:03,039
Speaker 1: I ordered it.

953
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:03,621
Speaker 0: You click the button.

954
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,830
Speaker 1: I clicked the button.

955
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,374
Speaker 1: I needed some other stuff.

956
00:50:09,116 --> 00:50:15,238
Speaker 0: Uh, also I bought, uh, when I bought that I got for free, uh, trade of, uh, omega the unknown classic.

957
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:15,960
Speaker 0: We'll see how that is.

958
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,156
Speaker 1: It was funny because you got this copy for free of that at the con.

959
00:50:20,176 --> 00:50:24,337
Speaker 0: And then we walk over to another booth, other booth that was on all these cheap old Marvel trades.

960
00:50:24,357 --> 00:50:26,547
Speaker 0: It's like a hundred copies of it just stacked up.

961
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:34,160
Speaker 0: They were like, they were like, the thing is, it'll be good because I planned, you know, I had planned for a while to buy the newer remake of omega, the unknown.

962
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,668
Speaker 0: That's supposed to be really fricking awesome.

963
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:40,732
Speaker 0: And now I'll get the background info, even if the background info is really bad old Marvel comics.

964
00:50:41,595 --> 00:50:43,322
Speaker 0: Uh, what else I get in the dealer's room there?

965
00:50:43,342 --> 00:50:45,511
Speaker 1: We got something that was quite a digression.

966
00:50:45,893 --> 00:50:46,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

967
00:50:46,636 --> 00:50:56,516
Speaker 1: I just while we were thinking of it, we talked about, we did comics for the manga reader, which is always an easy to run popular panel, which was cool because there were like half the people in the room.

968
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:59,327
Speaker 1: They were like, yeah, we read comics and manga.

969
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:04,568
Speaker 1: We know the score, but they didn't read most of the things we brought up and they were taking notes.

970
00:51:04,588 --> 00:51:06,376
Speaker 1: In fact, a lot of people were taking notes.

971
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:07,582
Speaker 0: It was actually strange.

972
00:51:07,602 --> 00:51:15,895
Speaker 0: Like you go to other cons and I see like, uh, when you were doing beyond D and D there are a few people taking notes at Otacon beyond D and D at Connecticut.

973
00:51:15,915 --> 00:51:18,024
Speaker 0: It seemed like everyone was taking notes.

974
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:22,182
Speaker 0: Like there's just so much note taking all of our panels, like an anime you should see.

975
00:51:22,403 --> 00:51:32,006
Speaker 1: There was this one cool guy in the back and he sat there and every anime we brought up that he had clearly not seen, he wrote it down and I could see him like putting different numbers of stars next to them.

976
00:51:32,307 --> 00:51:32,829
Speaker 0: Really?

977
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:33,311
Speaker 0: Yeah.

978
00:51:33,954 --> 00:51:36,222
Speaker 1: Let me tell you, princess two, two seems to have, you've got a circle.

979
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:39,235
Speaker 0: Oh, we brought up a circle means don't watch.

980
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,224
Speaker 0: Maybe put a line through a Ghostbusters style.

981
00:51:41,425 --> 00:51:45,063
Speaker 1: I don't know, but we showed princess two, two, and we'll, we'll get to that Saturday.

982
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:52,172
Speaker 1: We're going, but anyway, to get back on track, uh, comics for the manga reader, we talked about black sad, which is super hard to get.

983
00:51:52,232 --> 00:51:53,920
Speaker 1: It's this amazing French comic.

984
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,100
Speaker 1: So walking around the dealer's room, Emily sees in the distance and says, is that black sad?

985
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,603
Speaker 1: And I'm like, no way.

986
00:52:00,623 --> 00:52:13,146
Speaker 1: So we walk over and sure enough, amidst this sea, this veritable ocean of furry pornography is a single mint condition copy of the second volume of black sad in English for 20 bucks teaching.

987
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:15,275
Speaker 1: I bought that thing like faster.

988
00:52:15,395 --> 00:52:17,564
Speaker 1: Like I almost killed the dealer, just jumping over him to get it.

989
00:52:18,086 --> 00:52:21,440
Speaker 0: Some things we saw in the dealer's room, but did not buy.

990
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:22,041
Speaker 0: Let's see.

991
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:26,213
Speaker 0: Oh, there was, um, uh, carcass own the catapults.

992
00:52:26,354 --> 00:52:27,076
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

993
00:52:27,196 --> 00:52:28,520
Speaker 0: Which is a new word.

994
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,503
Speaker 1: No, we see it.

995
00:52:29,663 --> 00:52:33,215
Speaker 0: I knew carcass own expansion that has a working catapult.

996
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:34,841
Speaker 0: I guess you fling meeples with it.

997
00:52:35,102 --> 00:52:37,291
Speaker 0: Oh, it's just, it's, that's gotta be bad.

998
00:52:37,351 --> 00:52:39,943
Speaker 0: But the guy at the booth was like, yeah, I stopped with that one.

999
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:43,460
Speaker 1: We were laughing at it and the guy comes over and he was clearly the guy working.

1000
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:43,901
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1001
00:52:43,921 --> 00:52:44,906
Speaker 0: The guy who's booth it was.

1002
00:52:44,946 --> 00:52:46,614
Speaker 0: And he was just like, yeah, yeah.

1003
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:50,629
Speaker 1: Since we've digressed the other cool thing, we saw two cool things in the dealer's room.

1004
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:56,874
Speaker 1: One way back at the Jersey shore, we saw, you know, you can make a crystal with like a 3d image inside of it.

1005
00:52:57,456 --> 00:53:04,001
Speaker 1: And we wondered how it was made, but we didn't do any research, but I posited that very soon it was going to be fairly easy to do.

1006
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:09,460
Speaker 1: And we're going to see these things entering into geeky, geeky crafty realms at Connecticut.

1007
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,980
Speaker 1: And there was someone who was clearly started doing this and we asked him, how do you do it?

1008
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,988
Speaker 1: And we learned how to make those things.

1009
00:53:16,048 --> 00:53:18,900
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, you get a crystal and you get three lasers.

1010
00:53:19,561 --> 00:53:28,120
Speaker 0: And if the lasers all hit each other in the same spot, it basically makes a bubble in the crystal because it's hot enough, but it's not hot enough if you only have one or two lasers.

1011
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:34,204
Speaker 0: So this is a machine with three lasers and you program it and it makes art with little bubbles inside of a crystal.

1012
00:53:34,886 --> 00:53:35,449
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

1013
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:35,950
Speaker 1: Yep.

1014
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:40,725
Speaker 1: And the other thing we saw was these people who made custom vampire fangs.

1015
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:47,754
Speaker 1: And while that sounds creepy, they're super high quality and they make them like for you, for your teeth, like perfectly right there.

1016
00:53:48,217 --> 00:53:49,523
Speaker 1: They, they were pretty hardcore.

1017
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:49,805
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1018
00:53:49,825 --> 00:53:50,751
Speaker 0: They were totally awesome.

1019
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,757
Speaker 1: They were pretty cheap too.

1020
00:53:51,817 --> 00:53:54,475
Speaker 0: I was basically, they just, yeah, they just had people just freaking lining up.

1021
00:53:54,515 --> 00:53:55,963
Speaker 0: Basically they were making them constantly.

1022
00:53:55,983 --> 00:54:04,155
Speaker 0: The only reason I did not even after the dealer's room closed, they were still making them like in the gaming room, a minor fuck you to those guys.

1023
00:54:04,215 --> 00:54:07,067
Speaker 1: That room smelled like acrylic for like eight hours.

1024
00:54:07,348 --> 00:54:07,589
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1025
00:54:07,649 --> 00:54:08,874
Speaker 0: That's why we had to leave that room.

1026
00:54:09,015 --> 00:54:09,215
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1027
00:54:09,276 --> 00:54:15,467
Speaker 1: But that aside, the only reason I didn't get them was that I could not sit still long enough, you know, because we ran panel five for the whole con.

1028
00:54:15,768 --> 00:54:15,969
Speaker 1: Yep.

1029
00:54:17,073 --> 00:54:24,509
Speaker 0: Even though I'm not a creepy vampire person, like having a pair of vampire fangs, I mean, the, one of the people there was like, yeah, these have lasted me like 12 years.

1030
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:26,238
Speaker 0: I'm like, well shit, you know, who knows?

1031
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:27,483
Speaker 0: And I'll need some fangs.

1032
00:54:27,623 --> 00:54:28,506
Speaker 1: What did we realize?

1033
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:35,309
Speaker 1: Well, Scott's a biter, so definitely, but you can put just one in and now you have the cute anime single thing.

1034
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:35,791
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1035
00:54:36,112 --> 00:54:39,748
Speaker 0: Basically all it is is a cap that goes over your pointy tooth and makes it even pointy.

1036
00:54:39,789 --> 00:54:43,085
Speaker 1: And the guy's like, yeah, you know, don't eat anything or bite anything.

1037
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:44,291
Speaker 0: Obviously don't bite yourself.

1038
00:54:44,412 --> 00:54:49,911
Speaker 1: Don't fall asleep with them on and you're going to wake up with a missing fang and a painful, uh, anyway.

1039
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:50,172
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1040
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,499
Speaker 1: So move back to my original point.

1041
00:54:53,402 --> 00:54:55,951
Speaker 1: Leiji Masumoto's galaxy express three nines.

1042
00:54:56,313 --> 00:55:00,227
Speaker 1: The schedule got compressed, which worked to our favor, but we couldn't show the whole movie.

1043
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:08,753
Speaker 1: So instead we demoed, we basically tried out what we are proposing to do at Otacon next year, which was MC showings of anime.

1044
00:55:08,793 --> 00:55:13,232
Speaker 1: So Scott and mostly Scott, because at this point it was all Scott, I was done.

1045
00:55:13,273 --> 00:55:15,444
Speaker 1: I sat in the audience and almost like galaxy express.

1046
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:16,067
Speaker 0: That's my deal.

1047
00:55:16,247 --> 00:55:18,999
Speaker 1: It is, but not that it is not everyone's deal.

1048
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:20,003
Speaker 1: You just don't realize it yet.

1049
00:55:20,565 --> 00:55:22,151
Speaker 1: Scott gave a good, you know, 15 minute.

1050
00:55:22,412 --> 00:55:24,380
Speaker 1: Here's the deal with this described.

1051
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,694
Speaker 0: It was not as good as I could have done it cause it was midnight ish.

1052
00:55:27,935 --> 00:55:30,928
Speaker 1: And then we showed to this crowd who had pretty much never seen it.

1053
00:55:30,988 --> 00:55:36,148
Speaker 1: The first episode of galaxy express three nines and it went over really well.

1054
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:40,970
Speaker 1: I think almost everyone in that room is going to watch all of the show or at least most of it on crunchy roll.

1055
00:55:41,974 --> 00:55:44,023
Speaker 0: Hopefully they'll skip some of the bad episodes.

1056
00:55:44,866 --> 00:55:45,991
Speaker 1: Thing is they don't get that bad.

1057
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:47,075
Speaker 1: They never get to that.

1058
00:55:47,115 --> 00:55:48,802
Speaker 0: There are, there are silly episodes.

1059
00:55:48,942 --> 00:55:52,012
Speaker 1: I never get to the Island episode, uh, extent.

1060
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:56,650
Speaker 0: There is some, I guess not, but you know, there's some that could be considered Island episodes.

1061
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:57,032
Speaker 0: Anyway.

1062
00:55:57,715 --> 00:56:00,006
Speaker 0: Uh, we also, the enemy used to see showing actually.

1063
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,694
Speaker 0: I really, that was totally awesome.

1064
00:56:01,754 --> 00:56:02,638
Speaker 0: Like it was Saturday.

1065
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:02,940
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1066
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:03,963
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

1067
00:56:03,983 --> 00:56:04,746
Speaker 0: Then we'll, we'll wait.

1068
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:06,071
Speaker 0: All right.

1069
00:56:06,392 --> 00:56:06,653
Speaker 0: All right.

1070
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:07,376
Speaker 0: Ready for Saturday.

1071
00:56:07,396 --> 00:56:10,734
Speaker 0: So I mean, you should see it was just as awesome as it always is.

1072
00:56:10,774 --> 00:56:11,760
Speaker 0: You got a whole bunch of people.

1073
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,092
Speaker 0: He told him the enemy, you should see same panel as always.

1074
00:56:14,253 --> 00:56:22,942
Speaker 1: What's credit is always, there are people who have been to this panel three times and they come every time because they just enjoy it.

1075
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,334
Speaker 0: And I don't know what's so enjoyable about it.

1076
00:56:25,354 --> 00:56:25,997
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1077
00:56:26,057 --> 00:56:27,322
Speaker 1: I could see it being enjoyable.

1078
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:28,407
Speaker 1: I mean, we're funny.

1079
00:56:28,447 --> 00:56:30,435
Speaker 0: Watch this moron moron.

1080
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:31,680
Speaker 0: I can't believe you haven't watched this.

1081
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,810
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you call yourself an anime fan.

1082
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:34,976
Speaker 0: You haven't watched this yet.

1083
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:37,992
Speaker 0: We said the same exact things to watch as we told you to watch the last time.

1084
00:56:38,273 --> 00:56:39,500
Speaker 0: Why have you still not watched them?

1085
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,101
Speaker 1: I think they always forget that they can just go to the website and download the slides and see the list.

1086
00:56:44,342 --> 00:56:49,184
Speaker 1: So they keep coming back after they've seen like the things they wrote down to watch more of the things that they wrote down.

1087
00:56:50,428 --> 00:57:04,223
Speaker 0: Anyway, afterwards, uh, we did this, we re did, we originally scheduled it for two hours and I sort of wish we had had the two hours, but we had an anime music showing, which is basically the idea was, Hey, we told you what to see, but now you have no excuse.

1088
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:08,382
Speaker 0: If you sit right there and don't move your ass at all, we're just going to show them to you.

1089
00:57:08,643 --> 00:57:08,904
Speaker 0: Right.

1090
00:57:09,064 --> 00:57:13,704
Speaker 0: Then you got no excuses for not watching this crap, but being short, you know, we only had an hour.

1091
00:57:14,407 --> 00:57:17,379
Speaker 1: and the scary thing is we had to turn people away because the room was full.

1092
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:28,158
Speaker 1: for no, you know, animation see a panel's worth of people lined up to see, see the anime you should see, but only a few of them could get in because the room was already full from anime.

1093
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:30,810
Speaker 0: You should say, yeah, we got to put that in bigger room next year.

1094
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:31,132
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1095
00:57:31,292 --> 00:57:33,341
Speaker 1: But as a result, you know, we was cut short.

1096
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:33,984
Speaker 1: The room was full.

1097
00:57:34,627 --> 00:57:38,543
Speaker 1: We basically showed a bunch of short things first, which I had planned to show anyway.

1098
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:41,395
Speaker 1: And then one episode of something and it, it worked so well.

1099
00:57:41,436 --> 00:57:42,801
Speaker 1: We showed the daikon anime.

1100
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:42,942
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1101
00:57:42,962 --> 00:57:46,457
Speaker 0: I mean, think about almost despite the daikon animations, right.

1102
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:57,371
Speaker 0: Being such this incredibly important stuff on a very small, small percentage of, you know, uh, American anime fans know what they are, have seen them, understand them, et cetera.

1103
00:57:57,411 --> 00:57:57,652
Speaker 0: Right.

1104
00:57:57,973 --> 00:58:03,413
Speaker 0: So I explained the daikon animations and then showed three and four, both of them.

1105
00:58:03,553 --> 00:58:03,814
Speaker 0: Right.

1106
00:58:03,955 --> 00:58:07,989
Speaker 0: Of course, if you don't know, there are only two of them, three and four, there's no one or two.

1107
00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:21,446
Speaker 0: Um, and you know, because I had explained this, you know, so intently to people like look at this 1982 nerds in a basement drawing on cells, right?

1108
00:58:21,506 --> 00:58:23,813
Speaker 0: No computers, no nothing.

1109
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:27,426
Speaker 0: They brought this to a convention and showed it to everyone at the convention.

1110
00:58:27,446 --> 00:58:35,380
Speaker 1: And I was like, uh, nevermind the whole story about how now studio madhouse does the same thing for those same people who made that eventually made Ava.

1111
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,967
Speaker 0: What are you doing with your life?

1112
00:58:37,007 --> 00:58:38,514
Speaker 0: Sitting as anime con losers.

1113
00:58:38,574 --> 00:58:38,775
Speaker 0: Right.

1114
00:58:39,137 --> 00:58:43,434
Speaker 0: And then I showed it to him and I showed him the other one and of course they were blown away.

1115
00:58:43,455 --> 00:58:43,776
Speaker 1: Right.

1116
00:58:43,796 --> 00:58:46,490
Speaker 0: Like they were, they were like clapping and I'm like, what the fuck?

1117
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,782
Speaker 0: No one who made this is here to this day is my name.

1118
00:58:48,822 --> 00:58:49,224
Speaker 0: He did.

1119
00:58:49,264 --> 00:58:49,746
Speaker 0: I know.

1120
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:50,107
Speaker 0: No.

1121
00:58:50,188 --> 00:58:54,705
Speaker 1: So stop clapping because people clap after showing because it's the expression of, you know what?

1122
00:58:55,047 --> 00:58:56,011
Speaker 1: That was crazy.

1123
00:58:56,191 --> 00:58:56,493
Speaker 1: Awesome.

1124
00:58:56,553 --> 00:58:58,260
Speaker 1: And I have to express how awesome it was.

1125
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:06,185
Speaker 1: But the thing is, uh, after we showed that we showed on your mark, which no one had fricking seen.

1126
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:10,217
Speaker 1: And I saw a couple of people in the audience crying at the end of it.

1127
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:11,582
Speaker 0: Well, that's what it's supposed to do.

1128
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:12,948
Speaker 1: I cried the first time I saw it.

1129
00:59:13,068 --> 00:59:14,153
Speaker 0: Miyazaki is the master.

1130
00:59:14,313 --> 00:59:14,956
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

1131
00:59:14,976 --> 00:59:15,398
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1132
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:17,186
Speaker 1: I learned there's another version of that.

1133
00:59:17,326 --> 00:59:19,376
Speaker 1: That is also for reals to a different song.

1134
00:59:19,516 --> 00:59:19,998
Speaker 1: Really?

1135
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:20,099
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1136
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,442
Speaker 0: I did not know that.

1137
00:59:21,482 --> 00:59:24,712
Speaker 1: I learned a bunch of stuff about on your mark.

1138
00:59:26,578 --> 00:59:27,240
Speaker 1: Beyond what I knew.

1139
00:59:29,802 --> 00:59:33,657
Speaker 1: Now then we did this because this is how we found out about magnetic Rose.

1140
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:37,574
Speaker 1: And also while I would normally be hesitant to do this sort of thing,

1141
00:59:37,614 --> 00:59:40,488
Speaker 0: I would have just showed magnetic Rose if we had some fricking time, but there

1142
00:59:40,568 --> 00:59:49,782
Speaker 1: is, there happens to be four magnetic Rose, like Kevin Caldwell anime music video that expresses how amazing magnetic Rose is as well as can be expressed.

1143
00:59:50,564 --> 00:59:56,644
Speaker 1: So we showed that after explaining, you know, this is just an AMV and good God, people love that.

1144
00:59:56,684 --> 00:59:56,864
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1145
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:58,009
Speaker 0: Oh man, we should have used.

1146
00:59:58,029 --> 00:59:58,551
Speaker 0: Oh no.

1147
00:59:58,652 --> 01:00:00,841
Speaker 0: At that panel instead of the other one.

1148
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:14,146
Speaker 1: Well, my plan for Otacon, if we get the room is to show, do you know, either Friday or Saturday at a kind of early good time anime, you should see for like an hour and a half and go into more depth on into two hours.

1149
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:14,749
Speaker 1: All right.

1150
01:00:14,769 --> 01:00:16,015
Speaker 1: Two hours of animation scene.

1151
01:00:16,035 --> 01:00:16,980
Speaker 1: We'll start with the basics.

1152
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,787
Speaker 1: You go all the way through the obscure and everything.

1153
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:25,915
Speaker 1: And then I want the next like six hours in that room to be just showings and commentary.

1154
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,866
Speaker 1: showings and commentary to introduce people to every great anime.

1155
01:00:29,147 --> 01:00:33,907
Speaker 0: But anyway, we also showed the first episode of princess due to, and let me tell you, I think it worked.

1156
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:37,363
Speaker 0: I think people realize that that was a real show and not two, two.

1157
01:00:38,046 --> 01:00:39,854
Speaker 1: I still, you know, we talked about this in other reviews.

1158
01:00:40,215 --> 01:00:44,311
Speaker 1: I think we personally have caused this huge resurgence in princess.

1159
01:00:44,332 --> 01:00:47,002
Speaker 1: two, two, because you know, we keep an every animation.

1160
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:51,038
Speaker 1: See, it is like the poster child of don't deny an anime.

1161
01:00:51,058 --> 01:00:54,633
Speaker 1: If you don't know what it's really about, two two is awesome and you'll like it.

1162
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,219
Speaker 1: Don't be turned off by the fact you do.

1163
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:59,215
Speaker 0: We should watch all the fancy Lala and then start pushing that.

1164
01:00:59,396 --> 01:01:00,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should.

1165
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:08,331
Speaker 1: The dinosaurs, dinosaurs, the sad episode where she draws the pet and oh my God, we should do princess to do first fancy Lala.

1166
01:01:08,412 --> 01:01:09,918
Speaker 0: dinosaurs versus dancing.

1167
01:01:09,938 --> 01:01:15,260
Speaker 1: You know, if we keep doing this, then someday we're going to get to a point to where people trust us so much.

1168
01:01:15,961 --> 01:01:19,515
Speaker 1: That's the point where we're like space sailor photon starlight.

1169
01:01:19,595 --> 01:01:21,182
Speaker 1: Odeon is like the best fucking show ever.

1170
01:01:21,202 --> 01:01:24,134
Speaker 0: showed Odeon at the con in one of the showing rooms.

1171
01:01:24,355 --> 01:01:25,460
Speaker 0: I don't know who went to see it.

1172
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,684
Speaker 1: We told people not to.

1173
01:01:26,704 --> 01:01:34,635
Speaker 1: We told some people to, okay, but princess to, to, you know, obviously the people in the audience, you know, some people were dubious.

1174
01:01:35,097 --> 01:01:40,903
Speaker 1: They were kind of less dubious now because a lot of people who had seen the panel before clapped and cheered and told them all to watch.

1175
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:44,199
Speaker 0: It's basically, that's why you showed princess two to last, right?

1176
01:01:44,219 --> 01:01:50,291
Speaker 0: It's like, we show them the daikon and they're just, and the, and the, you know, on your mark and they're just overcome with emotion at this amazingness.

1177
01:01:50,351 --> 01:01:50,612
Speaker 0: Right?

1178
01:01:50,994 --> 01:01:52,842
Speaker 0: So it's like, okay, I've showed you this amazingness.

1179
01:01:52,862 --> 01:01:54,489
Speaker 0: You trust me now, right?

1180
01:01:54,730 --> 01:02:00,070
Speaker 0: You trust me enough to sit your ass and watch this princess due to, you know, even though it's called princess tutu.

1181
01:02:00,271 --> 01:02:09,203
Speaker 1: during the opener of princess to do the look on their faces, people in their crowd were like, ah, you sure guys, when she makes that pile of flowers at the end, God damn.

1182
01:02:11,168 --> 01:02:11,529
Speaker 0: Anyway.

1183
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:13,012
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

1184
01:02:13,393 --> 01:02:15,839
Speaker 0: So, uh, what else did we do on Saturday?

1185
01:02:15,979 --> 01:02:20,156
Speaker 0: We did, we actually got away and were able to do things on Saturday besides just panels.

1186
01:02:20,217 --> 01:02:31,720
Speaker 1: Well, because you see for the first time ever, you know, geek nights is at front row crew.com because the front row crew is the group and geek nights is just the headlining front lining thing of the front row.

1187
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,101
Speaker 0: Yes.

1188
01:02:32,161 --> 01:02:33,909
Speaker 0: I'm actually doing a lot of work on the website.

1189
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:34,974
Speaker 0: I made a big progress.

1190
01:02:35,497 --> 01:02:44,472
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, I'm working on it on the train, but expect in the next two years to see this gigantic growing of all the other front row crew stuff.

1191
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:44,954
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1192
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:46,579
Speaker 0: I mean, we've always planned to do it.

1193
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,309
Speaker 0: It's just, you know, it takes a long time.

1194
01:02:48,329 --> 01:02:49,214
Speaker 0: We want to do it right.

1195
01:02:49,275 --> 01:02:54,760
Speaker 0: We don't want to, you know, he rushed into geek nights just to keep something up sort of like the same strategy GDGT had.

1196
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,297
Speaker 0: Remember they, they, and now they quit and gadget and they said, all right, GDGT.

1197
01:02:58,598 --> 01:03:07,933
Speaker 0: And they started doing a podcast, you know, which is basically the continuation of the old and gadget podcast, but it took them like a while to actually get GDGT the site up.

1198
01:03:08,435 --> 01:03:14,881
Speaker 0: So it's all taken us, uh, significantly longer, you know, it's been like, you know, four or five years, but even so stuff's coming.

1199
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:19,036
Speaker 0: Scott's box is now on a regular schedule route, you know, once a month.

1200
01:03:19,116 --> 01:03:23,874
Speaker 0: And, uh, I gotta, I'm going to do the last episode of Scott's got robot maybe next week.

1201
01:03:23,954 --> 01:03:24,396
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1202
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:36,643
Speaker 1: You know, so yeah, it's, it's going good here, but as a result, we got together several members of the front row crew and there was a large block where they presented panels and we went to get some fricking food.

1203
01:03:36,663 --> 01:03:37,446
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1204
01:03:37,506 --> 01:03:40,035
Speaker 0: I ended up getting a, I ate the con food once.

1205
01:03:40,075 --> 01:03:43,287
Speaker 0: the con food last year was actually really good this year.

1206
01:03:43,629 --> 01:03:44,231
Speaker 0: Not so good.

1207
01:03:44,292 --> 01:03:46,784
Speaker 1: Luckily that tavern nearby, like no one seems to know about it.

1208
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:48,174
Speaker 1: You can just go there and get lunch, like right away.

1209
01:03:48,194 --> 01:03:50,727
Speaker 0: You could see it when you walk out the front door of the convention center.

1210
01:03:51,069 --> 01:03:51,270
Speaker 1: Yup.

1211
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:56,975
Speaker 1: Despite being a brew pub though, or not, you know, nominally a tavern, pretty weak selection of beer.

1212
01:03:57,035 --> 01:03:59,044
Speaker 1: I had to suffice for the table wine, which was okay.

1213
01:03:59,365 --> 01:04:03,259
Speaker 0: It was pretty much just an average, you know, normal pub place.

1214
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:04,143
Speaker 0: It wasn't anything special.

1215
01:04:04,183 --> 01:04:09,789
Speaker 1: That was like the only time we got to get outside of this fricking room and walk around and that there's anywhere to walk to.

1216
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:13,342
Speaker 0: At least they had, we got the awesome breakfast twice.

1217
01:04:13,463 --> 01:04:14,467
Speaker 1: It was sad though.

1218
01:04:14,668 --> 01:04:16,436
Speaker 0: It was still there that we ran anime.

1219
01:04:16,456 --> 01:04:17,461
Speaker 1: You should see, see the anime.

1220
01:04:17,481 --> 01:04:17,944
Speaker 1: You should see it.

1221
01:04:17,964 --> 01:04:19,854
Speaker 1: It was like crazy, crazy crowded.

1222
01:04:19,935 --> 01:04:24,292
Speaker 1: Like people were sitting on the floor crowding in fire Marshall problem right after that.

1223
01:04:24,312 --> 01:04:27,021
Speaker 1: No, your creators learn about the directors.

1224
01:04:27,423 --> 01:04:28,827
Speaker 1: They're like 20 people in the room.

1225
01:04:29,048 --> 01:04:29,589
Speaker 1: Everyone leaves.

1226
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:30,332
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1227
01:04:31,857 --> 01:04:33,784
Speaker 1: But then we had Emily doing living in Japan.

1228
01:04:34,065 --> 01:04:37,200
Speaker 0: We had, I didn't see it, but I'm sure it was, we didn't get to see any of this.

1229
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,187
Speaker 1: We had independent game development with Alex.

1230
01:04:39,569 --> 01:04:41,075
Speaker 1: We had geekology.

1231
01:04:41,115 --> 01:04:43,785
Speaker 0: We're just presented a research that was real popular here.

1232
01:04:43,825 --> 01:04:45,993
Speaker 1: That was crazy popular law.

1233
01:04:46,074 --> 01:04:49,630
Speaker 1: And it was noted in the panel feedback session by two different people as being awesome.

1234
01:04:49,892 --> 01:04:50,133
Speaker 1: All right.

1235
01:04:50,294 --> 01:05:00,240
Speaker 1: How to be a good game master with Pete and Wyatt and you know, all the, all those, all the game masters and gamers in the front row crew, Kendo, the way of the sword with Katsunori Masashita, who is basically a kendo badass.

1236
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:10,894
Speaker 1: And then the Connecticut match game, which was scheduled originally for two hours, plus a half hour of setup, various main things made it be scheduled for an hour.

1237
01:05:11,215 --> 01:05:14,685
Speaker 1: And we did not prepare any guests and we had planned to cancel it.

1238
01:05:15,867 --> 01:05:18,192
Speaker 1: A lot of people showed up.

1239
01:05:18,533 --> 01:05:19,034
Speaker 0: Of course.

1240
01:05:19,595 --> 01:05:25,574
Speaker 1: So we, uh, we winged it and it seemed to go over really, really, really well.

1241
01:05:25,614 --> 01:05:32,455
Speaker 0: Luckily we put together a good panels, uncle, yo, me, uh, Emily Conrad and Scott Johnson.

1242
01:05:32,575 --> 01:05:32,976
Speaker 1: It was.

1243
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:40,426
Speaker 1: And for contestants, so we got a pretty good contestant from the audience and we got Laura to be the ringer because Laura knows her anime.

1244
01:05:40,446 --> 01:05:43,578
Speaker 1: So I could count on Laura to give the funny anime answer.

1245
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:44,140
Speaker 0: Yep.

1246
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,116
Speaker 0: She also scored a whole bunch of points because she knew what was going on.

1247
01:05:48,136 --> 01:05:50,144
Speaker 0: Did the contestants score any points at all?

1248
01:05:50,224 --> 01:05:50,465
Speaker 0: Never.

1249
01:05:50,485 --> 01:05:52,493
Speaker 0: Oh, so sad.

1250
01:05:52,653 --> 01:05:53,195
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

1251
01:05:53,275 --> 01:05:57,128
Speaker 1: I gave, we gave the contestant the, uh, prize, if you can call it that anyway.

1252
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:57,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1253
01:05:58,513 --> 01:06:00,499
Speaker 1: It was a most dangerous prize.

1254
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:04,355
Speaker 0: You know, that's the one thing is after I saw that our schedule got changed.

1255
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:08,516
Speaker 0: I thought going into kinetic con, we would, at least we would cancel two or three things.

1256
01:06:08,557 --> 01:06:10,446
Speaker 0: I thought we might've canceled the galaxy express.

1257
01:06:11,089 --> 01:06:12,275
Speaker 0: We would cancel the match game.

1258
01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:16,053
Speaker 0: I thought we would cancel the crab people and the Saturday night hangout.

1259
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:17,680
Speaker 1: We plan to cancel a lot of these things.

1260
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,470
Speaker 0: Well, the Saturday night hangout was sort of canceled.

1261
01:06:19,692 --> 01:06:22,646
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, it was canceled in that we just left.

1262
01:06:22,806 --> 01:06:22,927
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1263
01:06:22,947 --> 01:06:23,710
Speaker 0: We just went to bed.

1264
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:24,171
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1265
01:06:24,332 --> 01:06:24,553
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1266
01:06:24,593 --> 01:06:26,380
Speaker 0: Well actually, no, we went and played games.

1267
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,042
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

1268
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:30,232
Speaker 0: But yeah, no, we didn't cancel anything.

1269
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:35,975
Speaker 0: It just, it all, we ran all those events and they actually turned out a lot better than you would expect.

1270
01:06:36,055 --> 01:06:37,482
Speaker 0: Just throwing some shit together.

1271
01:06:37,502 --> 01:06:41,460
Speaker 1: Oh, uncle yo did his, uh, standup, uh, Saturday night right after the match game.

1272
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:42,746
Speaker 0: Very popular, big line.

1273
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:43,189
Speaker 1: Super awesome.

1274
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:46,968
Speaker 1: A lot of people looked like they had to be turned away because no one left the room from the match game.

1275
01:06:47,188 --> 01:06:47,469
Speaker 0: I know.

1276
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:47,710
Speaker 0: Right.

1277
01:06:49,015 --> 01:06:50,943
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, but Saturday was just totally cool.

1278
01:06:51,124 --> 01:06:52,750
Speaker 0: Uh, what did I do on Saturday?

1279
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:53,614
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

1280
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:54,377
Speaker 0: We did panels.

1281
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:56,507
Speaker 1: We ate, we did the super art flight.

1282
01:06:56,527 --> 01:06:56,889
Speaker 0: All right.

1283
01:06:56,909 --> 01:06:57,372
Speaker 0: That's right.

1284
01:06:57,412 --> 01:07:01,879
Speaker 0: While, while everyone else is running panels, we did the super art fight, which you already talked about and things of the day.

1285
01:07:02,121 --> 01:07:03,226
Speaker 0: We went to the dealer's room.

1286
01:07:03,266 --> 01:07:04,432
Speaker 0: I went to the artist's alley.

1287
01:07:04,492 --> 01:07:05,960
Speaker 0: I looked around the gaming area.

1288
01:07:06,641 --> 01:07:07,966
Speaker 0: We went to eat lunch.

1289
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,170
Speaker 0: We did all that sort of stuff.

1290
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:11,358
Speaker 1: So, um, I got plus.

1291
01:07:11,378 --> 01:07:15,739
Speaker 1: Saturday night, like we, we gamed all night hanging out with Luke Crane and Phil and the rest of the crew.

1292
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:16,141
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1293
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:19,217
Speaker 0: We played a trans Europa, which is a game we will talk about in the future.

1294
01:07:19,238 --> 01:07:20,584
Speaker 0: Maybe we get a chance to play it again.

1295
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:21,327
Speaker 0: Nice.

1296
01:07:21,488 --> 01:07:24,320
Speaker 0: You know, simple to learn, difficult to master kind of game.

1297
01:07:24,822 --> 01:07:25,807
Speaker 1: Oh, we were also hanging out.

1298
01:07:25,867 --> 01:07:34,640
Speaker 1: I'll give a shout out to people at the end of this episode, but we got to hang out with the awesome staffer, the panel staffer from our room, who I forget your name, dude, but you were totally awesome.

1299
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:35,241
Speaker 0: Yup.

1300
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:40,020
Speaker 0: There was also awesome dude who asked me for a copy of galaxy express three nine, the movie.

1301
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:48,440
Speaker 0: I mailed him a DVD today that has that the second movie, the sanctuary manga, and also all of DMC.

1302
01:07:48,781 --> 01:07:49,764
Speaker 1: Oh man.

01:07:49,804 --> 01:07:50,386
Speaker 0: Which he wanted.

01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,871
Speaker 0: So that guy's awesome.

1305
01:07:51,912 --> 01:07:52,775
Speaker 0: I sent him his DVD.

1306
01:07:52,975 --> 01:07:53,256
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1307
01:07:53,296 --> 01:08:01,668
Speaker 1: Speaking of which DMC crazy popular, but you know, we showed it on Friday, like early in the morning and we showed it again on Saturday, early in the morning.

1308
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:07,409
Speaker 1: And the first, basically we had to pull the, well, anyone in this room be offended by this.

1309
01:08:07,952 --> 01:08:12,088
Speaker 1: And there was on Saturday, there was this kid clearly there for one day, like with his mom.

1310
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:14,155
Speaker 1: And he's kind of young.

1311
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:15,340
Speaker 1: He was like middle school.

1312
01:08:15,882 --> 01:08:21,185
Speaker 1: And we're like, well, anyone be offended by very, very strong language, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1313
01:08:21,205 --> 01:08:23,192
Speaker 1: And the kids looking real nervous.

1314
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:26,341
Speaker 1: And he looks at his mom and his mom's like, yeah, whatever.

1315
01:08:26,362 --> 01:08:33,359
Speaker 1: And then he's like, and they both laughed heartily at Detroit metal city.

1316
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,504
Speaker 0: It's the legend of Krauser.

1317
01:08:36,524 --> 01:08:36,925
Speaker 0: All right.

01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:44,169
Speaker 1: So let's see what else went down at the CT con convention went down, but we didn't get to see any of that.

1319
01:08:44,609 --> 01:08:44,992
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1320
01:08:45,774 --> 01:08:49,209
Speaker 0: Uh, what of the convention did I see besides the super art fight?

1321
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:49,871
Speaker 1: We'll get to that.

1322
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:54,268
Speaker 1: I saw some cool stuff, but, uh, Sunday, Sunday was the death day, Sunday, Sunday.

1323
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:57,801
Speaker 1: We, I was, I was so like, I was just, I was done on Sunday.

1324
01:08:57,841 --> 01:08:59,269
Speaker 0: I was actually kind of okay on Sunday.

1325
01:08:59,288 --> 01:09:00,897
Speaker 0: Cause I got an okay sleep on Saturday.

1326
01:09:01,258 --> 01:09:02,804
Speaker 1: I got like five hours of sleep.

1327
01:09:02,823 --> 01:09:04,188
Speaker 1: Cause we stayed up until like two.

1328
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:05,191
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1329
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:09,408
Speaker 1: But we had to be back at the con at eight for good morning, Connecticut.

1330
01:09:09,428 --> 01:09:10,594
Speaker 1: Hey, we had to check out of the hotel.

1331
01:09:10,734 --> 01:09:11,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was all right.

1332
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,001
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1333
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:13,791
Speaker 0: Checking out of the hotel was a little bit rough.

1334
01:09:13,831 --> 01:09:14,978
Speaker 0: And then I left the present.

1335
01:09:15,018 --> 01:09:16,163
Speaker 0: I bought a presentation clicker.

1336
01:09:16,205 --> 01:09:17,049
Speaker 0: That was totally awesome.

1337
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,000
Speaker 0: And it totally sweet and worth every penny.

1338
01:09:19,381 --> 01:09:23,640
Speaker 0: I almost left it in the hotel room, but luckily I also forgot to leave my key in the hotel room.

1339
01:09:23,981 --> 01:09:28,636
Speaker 0: So I was able to go back up and get it, but the elevators, oh man, it sucked.

1340
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:34,180
Speaker 0: I ended up actually getting off on like the ninth floor from the 19th floor and then taking the stairs from there.

1341
01:09:34,581 --> 01:09:40,444
Speaker 0: And then I met someone in the elevator who knew me and, you know, we walked down the stairs and it was kind of crazy.

1342
01:09:40,606 --> 01:09:42,395
Speaker 1: We had something special scheduled on it.

1343
01:09:42,415 --> 01:09:44,082
Speaker 1: Well, we had a couple of things on Sunday.

1344
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:54,640
Speaker 1: Sunday was the, for anyone who wants to know, you know, how do you pull off dealing with situations or on the fly coming up with, you know, managing a panel or entertaining your crowd.

1345
01:09:55,301 --> 01:10:00,443
Speaker 1: Sunday was the day because we pulled everything off without a hitch, but, uh, good morning, whatever.

1346
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:01,927
Speaker 1: Crab people.

1347
01:10:02,068 --> 01:10:05,117
Speaker 1: We scheduled this in the book because we had nothing.

1348
01:10:05,138 --> 01:10:06,342
Speaker 1: We had no idea what to put here.

1349
01:10:06,362 --> 01:10:11,782
Speaker 1: So we scheduled it and we figured at some point during the con, we would come up with an idea.

1350
01:10:11,802 --> 01:10:12,926
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1351
01:10:12,986 --> 01:10:20,498
Speaker 0: So we went in to the crab people panel and of course, no matter what we were going to talk about what crab people is, and we talked about the South park episode of crab.

1352
01:10:20,518 --> 01:10:24,013
Speaker 1: There were a lot of people there, scary number of people, right?

1353
01:10:24,315 --> 01:10:29,602
Speaker 0: So we described to them, you know, what crab people is, you know, and how it's sort of a placeholder for when you don't know what else to put there.

1354
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:33,800
Speaker 0: And sometimes if you don't ever come up with a replacement, it's just crab people.

1355
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,508
Speaker 0: And that's why there's crab people in South park.

1356
01:10:35,668 --> 01:10:37,598
Speaker 1: So we do this for a couple of minutes.

1357
01:10:37,698 --> 01:10:41,452
Speaker 1: And then sure enough, cat low, who already had a panel prepared.

1358
01:10:41,472 --> 01:10:42,717
Speaker 1: Uh, no means no.

1359
01:10:42,757 --> 01:10:45,687
Speaker 1: When she ran at Otacon ran her panel and everyone loved it.

1360
01:10:45,989 --> 01:10:46,189
Speaker 0: Yep.

1361
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:46,852
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

1362
01:10:47,454 --> 01:10:49,542
Speaker 1: And, uh, I think what I want to do is a great filler.

1363
01:10:50,505 --> 01:10:53,495
Speaker 1: anywhere we ever are in charge of panels or in any capacity.

1364
01:10:53,515 --> 01:11:01,488
Speaker 1: I want to always schedule a crab people on Sunday, just always, I want it to be like this kind of semi inside joke shtick because cons have that stuff.

1365
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:06,490
Speaker 1: There'll always be the crab people and people will know that when you go to that panel, there are crab people.

1366
01:11:07,193 --> 01:11:11,088
Speaker 0: Maybe like we should have like crazy surprises at the panel.

1367
01:11:11,389 --> 01:11:13,478
Speaker 0: Like if we're head of panels, like Connecticut, right?

1368
01:11:13,518 --> 01:11:17,917
Speaker 0: Maybe crab people should be like one of the big guests panels, like secret XKCD panel.

1369
01:11:18,078 --> 01:11:18,299
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1370
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:21,070
Speaker 0: Like, Oh, by the way, random Monroe is at the convention.

1371
01:11:21,392 --> 01:11:22,777
Speaker 0: I didn't even see him or talk to him.

1372
01:11:22,938 --> 01:11:24,424
Speaker 0: I did see him at MOCA.

1373
01:11:24,505 --> 01:11:30,069
Speaker 1: One point I'm in our room and you know, the room's kind of full and I see this crazy line outside the door.

1374
01:11:30,109 --> 01:11:31,636
Speaker 0: And all the time there was a crazy line.

1375
01:11:31,696 --> 01:11:32,520
Speaker 0: It was for animal Monroe.

1376
01:11:32,882 --> 01:11:36,259
Speaker 0: every time, both times, two times because everything else that was a big line.

1377
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:40,896
Speaker 0: It was either super art fight, which we saw or for us or something in our room.

1378
01:11:40,937 --> 01:11:43,226
Speaker 1: Like I say one thing we couldn't have super art fight.

1379
01:11:43,246 --> 01:11:50,253
Speaker 1: We would not have been able to see it except that we kind of know the people who do it and we know the artists and such.

1380
01:11:50,614 --> 01:11:57,061
Speaker 1: So, and you know, as we're walking toward art fight, the art fight people like, Hey, you guys geek guides, you got to go to art fight.

1381
01:11:57,081 --> 01:11:58,227
Speaker 1: We're like, we're on our way.

1382
01:11:58,247 --> 01:11:59,333
Speaker 1: And they're like, Oh man, cool.

1383
01:11:59,394 --> 01:11:59,716
Speaker 1: Okay.

1384
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:04,319
Speaker 0: And then we get to it and those people waiting to go into super art fight, but there's still a panel in there.

1385
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:05,123
Speaker 0: That's not over yet.

1386
01:12:05,505 --> 01:12:07,996
Speaker 0: So we just walk in and sit in the front row for the panel.

1387
01:12:08,016 --> 01:12:08,760
Speaker 0: That's not over yet.

1388
01:12:09,221 --> 01:12:13,621
Speaker 0: Well, well, well, and then that panel leaves and we're sitting in the front row for super art fight.

1389
01:12:13,822 --> 01:12:17,780
Speaker 1: We walk up to the door and one of the super art fight guys goes, Hey, it's you guys.

1390
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,865
Speaker 1: And he kind of points us in.

1391
01:12:18,905 --> 01:12:21,760
Speaker 1: So we walked in to the other panel and just sat in the front row.

1392
01:12:22,202 --> 01:12:22,926
Speaker 0: I just walked right in.

1393
01:12:22,946 --> 01:12:23,791
Speaker 0: I didn't even see that guy.

1394
01:12:24,253 --> 01:12:26,705
Speaker 1: That guy waved to say, and I had talked to him a little bit, whatever.

1395
01:12:26,765 --> 01:12:27,247
Speaker 0: It's all good.

1396
01:12:27,508 --> 01:12:29,075
Speaker 0: Super art fight rocks the shizzy.

1397
01:12:29,497 --> 01:12:30,039
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

1398
01:12:30,099 --> 01:12:39,275
Speaker 1: And I cannot say a hundred percent because it's not my department, but super art fight is almost definitely going to be at Connecticut next year, probably in main event.

1399
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:39,978
Speaker 0: I hope so.

1400
01:12:40,038 --> 01:12:44,200
Speaker 0: And I hope we can get super art fight, you know, to all sorts of other conventions that we can influence.

1401
01:12:45,081 --> 01:12:45,502
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

1402
01:12:45,683 --> 01:12:49,034
Speaker 0: Maybe even just, you know, like just in New York randomly.

1403
01:12:49,175 --> 01:12:53,089
Speaker 1: My goal is to get them at PAX East and to get Gabe to be a contestant.

1404
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:54,033
Speaker 1: Fuck yes.

1405
01:12:54,254 --> 01:12:56,281
Speaker 1: That would be like the biggest fucking thing.

1406
01:12:56,301 --> 01:12:58,507
Speaker 0: Gabe versus Kurtz.

1407
01:12:59,128 --> 01:13:00,111
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

1408
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:02,396
Speaker 0: You know, you know, it'd be awesome though.

1409
01:13:02,757 --> 01:13:06,772
Speaker 0: If we could get like, we can get like, uh, it would basically be like Gabe versus everyone.

1410
01:13:06,812 --> 01:13:07,073
Speaker 0: Right.

1411
01:13:07,354 --> 01:13:09,262
Speaker 0: So that we can tag out.

1412
01:13:09,483 --> 01:13:12,996
Speaker 0: We should have like, no, he should just have to fight three people.

1413
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:13,257
Speaker 0: Right.

1414
01:13:13,297 --> 01:13:15,949
Speaker 0: And here's, here's the three people I think Gabe should have to fight.

1415
01:13:15,969 --> 01:13:16,310
Speaker 0: You're ready.

1416
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:16,672
Speaker 0: All right.

1417
01:13:17,094 --> 01:13:19,263
Speaker 0: Scott Kurtz, the guy.

1418
01:13:19,303 --> 01:13:21,873
Speaker 0: Cause you know, they're so, you know, enemies, right.

1419
01:13:22,515 --> 01:13:24,543
Speaker 0: He should have to fight, uh, David Peterson.

1420
01:13:24,724 --> 01:13:25,929
Speaker 0: Cause he couldn't possibly win.

1421
01:13:25,949 --> 01:13:27,275
Speaker 0: We got it.

1422
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,400
Speaker 0: We have someone who can beat him.

1423
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:29,141
Speaker 0: Right.

1424
01:13:29,744 --> 01:13:34,260
Speaker 0: And the third person that he should have to fight is you don't remember the guy's name.

1425
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,405
Speaker 1: Are you thinking about who I'm thinking about?

1426
01:13:35,425 --> 01:13:40,123
Speaker 0: Oh, it's the guy that like gave, like Gabe was inspired by silver or something.

1427
01:13:40,563 --> 01:13:42,307
Speaker 0: The guy who did the Kim possible, whatever.

1428
01:13:42,327 --> 01:13:49,002
Speaker 0: Oh, cause it's like, that's a duel.

1429
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:50,550
Speaker 1: And he never said why exactly.

1430
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:51,012
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1431
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:56,160
Speaker 0: I wish I could remember what that guy's name was, but those are the three people that should fight gate gave in the super art fight.

1432
01:13:58,021 --> 01:14:01,015
Speaker 1: I like the idea of having an all-star cast that can tag team in and out.

1433
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:01,297
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1434
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:05,075
Speaker 0: Oh, one thing that was, uh, you know, the tag, you know, I was watching the tag battle.

1435
01:14:05,135 --> 01:14:07,306
Speaker 0: The tag battle actually was, didn't work out so well.

1436
01:14:07,326 --> 01:14:08,893
Speaker 0: I liked the non tag battles better.

1437
01:14:08,913 --> 01:14:11,686
Speaker 1: Well, you'd have to change up the rules of the tag battle.

1438
01:14:11,706 --> 01:14:14,156
Speaker 0: It can't just be a little out of control basically.

1439
01:14:14,197 --> 01:14:15,442
Speaker 0: And it lost sort of the structure.

1440
01:14:15,462 --> 01:14:20,140
Speaker 0: that sort of kept it, uh, kept it nice, even though some funny, crazy things did happen.

1441
01:14:20,601 --> 01:14:31,603
Speaker 1: I think, you know, the tag battle and all those people get involved, the results on the, on the tag battle, you realize has to be two V two and there's rules about if you tag someone in, you can't tag back.

1442
01:14:32,126 --> 01:14:32,427
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1443
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:33,471
Speaker 0: Stuff like that.

1444
01:14:33,531 --> 01:14:33,893
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1445
01:14:34,134 --> 01:14:35,017
Speaker 0: But that's not how they did it.

1446
01:14:35,057 --> 01:14:39,600
Speaker 0: It was basically just got out of control and there were just too many people doing arts and whatever, but it was cool.

1447
01:14:40,182 --> 01:14:44,200
Speaker 0: Uh, one thing though, there was the dude from Columbia, uh, what's his name?

1448
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:44,921
Speaker 0: Cypher.

1449
01:14:44,941 --> 01:14:45,444
Speaker 0: Right.

1450
01:14:45,464 --> 01:14:46,307
Speaker 0: I think was his name.

1451
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:47,773
Speaker 1: That guy was my favorite.

1452
01:14:47,873 --> 01:14:48,857
Speaker 1: My favorite non-Yuko.

1453
01:14:48,998 --> 01:14:49,219
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1454
01:14:49,259 --> 01:14:52,226
Speaker 0: I mean, Scott Johnson, our Scott Johnson, right.

1455
01:14:52,327 --> 01:14:58,824
Speaker 0: Said that that guy from Columbia is usually on a podcast with the extra life.

1456
01:14:59,085 --> 01:14:59,928
Speaker 0: Scott Johnson.

1457
01:14:59,988 --> 01:15:00,269
Speaker 0: Right.

1458
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:02,056
Speaker 1: So we got to get all three of them together.

1459
01:15:02,257 --> 01:15:02,438
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1460
01:15:02,478 --> 01:15:07,358
Speaker 0: So the best was, it was, uh, it was Cypher versus what Garth Graham, I think is the guy's name.

1461
01:15:07,398 --> 01:15:07,880
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

1462
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:13,380
Speaker 0: When he drew that, so Cypher started drawing zombies and Garth Graham started drawing gears.

1463
01:15:13,761 --> 01:15:17,234
Speaker 0: and then Garth goes over to put some gears on the zombies.

1464
01:15:17,455 --> 01:15:20,024
Speaker 0: So he goes over and puts a zombie bite in the gear.

1465
01:15:20,124 --> 01:15:25,099
Speaker 0: And that's when people were like, super our fight for the win.

1466
01:15:25,159 --> 01:15:27,107
Speaker 1: That gear butter was the second best thing.

1467
01:15:27,328 --> 01:15:28,875
Speaker 0: that gear bite and zombie man.

1468
01:15:29,136 --> 01:15:33,470
Speaker 1: Ah, it was pretty much the gear biter, the Bruce Campbell in a Cosby sweater macho man thing.

1469
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:36,358
Speaker 0: And a steampunk Pikachu.

1470
01:15:36,378 --> 01:15:40,008
Speaker 1: I don't as Dapper and top Haddish as steampunk.

1471
01:15:40,088 --> 01:15:41,433
Speaker 1: Pikachu was Pokemon.

1472
01:15:41,613 --> 01:15:43,640
Speaker 1: The horny unicorn behind Billy Mays.

1473
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:44,825
Speaker 0: I didn't like the horny unicorn.

1474
01:15:44,845 --> 01:15:45,589
Speaker 0: I like the steam poker.

1475
01:15:45,609 --> 01:15:48,484
Speaker 1: The horny unicorn got points when it became a clown.

1476
01:15:48,805 --> 01:15:48,946
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1477
01:15:49,248 --> 01:15:51,460
Speaker 0: I should go to the super art flight website and put some stuff in there.

1478
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:52,361
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1479
01:15:52,662 --> 01:15:54,026
Speaker 0: I just put in messenger Z.

1480
01:15:54,046 --> 01:15:57,676
Speaker 1: I was very, I saved the day twice.

1481
01:15:57,796 --> 01:16:02,609
Speaker 1: I'm so happy because you go did not know who super macho man Randy Savage was.

1482
01:16:02,629 --> 01:16:05,096
Speaker 1: Oh, but I had the pre.

1483
01:16:05,116 --> 01:16:09,696
Speaker 0: I was like G I S and I was like, I held it up and she's having to slim Jim.

1484
01:16:09,776 --> 01:16:10,319
Speaker 1: And she looks at it.

1485
01:16:10,339 --> 01:16:11,263
Speaker 1: She's like, Oh, that guy.

1486
01:16:11,303 --> 01:16:12,065
Speaker 1: And then it was game.

1487
01:16:12,908 --> 01:16:13,691
Speaker 1: Next art fight.

1488
01:16:14,113 --> 01:16:16,100
Speaker 1: Dude didn't know who a pagoda was.

1489
01:16:16,421 --> 01:16:17,243
Speaker 1: I pull up a picture.

1490
01:16:17,565 --> 01:16:21,960
Speaker 1: He looks at it for like two seconds and he draws a perfect a pagoda.

1491
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:22,602
Speaker 0: Pretty good.

1492
01:16:22,783 --> 01:16:23,507
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

1493
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,010
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1494
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:25,720
Speaker 0: That's what you have when you have artist skills.

1495
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:26,401
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1496
01:16:26,703 --> 01:16:27,948
Speaker 0: I mean, someone shows me a hello.

1497
01:16:27,968 --> 01:16:30,439
Speaker 0: It shows me a picture of a programming language.

1498
01:16:30,459 --> 01:16:31,865
Speaker 0: I'll do a hello world Tyco.

1499
01:16:31,885 --> 01:16:38,069
Speaker 1: I know you don't listen to our show, but remember when they did that comic way about how like Photoshop heroes.

1500
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:38,751
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1501
01:16:38,911 --> 01:16:40,115
Speaker 1: That is what art fight is.

1502
01:16:40,215 --> 01:16:40,576
Speaker 1: It is.

1503
01:16:40,617 --> 01:16:41,700
Speaker 1: It is Photoshop heroes.

1504
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:44,090
Speaker 0: We should find some way to bring super art fight online.

1505
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:46,381
Speaker 1: Oh, you could do that with some sort of real time.

1506
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:46,843
Speaker 1: Oh, cocky.

1507
01:16:46,863 --> 01:16:48,089
Speaker 1: But it loses the magic.

1508
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:56,807
Speaker 1: It does lose the magic of when the referee threw the yellow card at Yuko when she accidentally switched hands for a second to color something during the left-handed round.

1509
01:16:56,947 --> 01:16:58,231
Speaker 0: Yep.

1510
01:16:58,251 --> 01:16:59,154
Speaker 1: Uh, yellow card.

1511
01:17:00,277 --> 01:17:02,766
Speaker 1: Anyway, enough about super art fight as awesome as it is.

1512
01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:08,006
Speaker 1: Um, after crab people, Emily did becoming an animator, which I watched like 20 minutes of.

1513
01:17:08,067 --> 01:17:08,990
Speaker 0: I didn't watch any of it.

1514
01:17:09,894 --> 01:17:10,155
Speaker 0: It is

1515
01:17:10,175 --> 01:17:22,048
Speaker 1: really cool because I didn't get to see a lot of the front row crew panels to see, you know, we do like these panels on tech or anime, you know, things we really know a lot about and we're really, we had this Japanese professor come up to us after all of our panels.

1516
01:17:22,329 --> 01:17:22,631
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

1517
01:17:22,651 --> 01:17:23,334
Speaker 0: What was her name?

1518
01:17:23,434 --> 01:17:25,102
Speaker 1: I forget her name, but I have her business card.

1519
01:17:25,122 --> 01:17:26,064
Speaker 1: We're going to be talking.

1520
01:17:26,145 --> 01:17:26,967
Speaker 1: I want to do stuff with her.

1521
01:17:26,987 --> 01:17:27,569
Speaker 1: Cause she's cool.

1522
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:27,850
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1523
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:37,520
Speaker 0: She was coming over to study like, you know, fandom of anime and manga among the U S peoples.

1524
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,066
Speaker 0: Like she was seriously studying it.

1525
01:17:39,086 --> 01:17:42,823
Speaker 0: She was asking us all these great questions and it was, it was just totally awesome.

1526
01:17:42,843 --> 01:17:44,832
Speaker 0: And we definitely got to do a lot more stuff with her.

1527
01:17:45,274 --> 01:17:52,124
Speaker 1: But like, she was amazed at how much we know about anime, which is sad in a way because we are rank amateurs compared to the majesty of Daryl.

1528
01:17:52,144 --> 01:17:52,546
Speaker 1: So right.

1529
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,028
Speaker 0: I know.

1530
01:17:53,089 --> 01:17:53,269
Speaker 0: Right.

1531
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:59,030
Speaker 0: And she was like, wow, you know, more than Japanese people know about anime, just fucked up in a way.

1532
01:17:59,351 --> 01:18:04,730
Speaker 1: But so, you know, all this professionalism, I lost my train of thought, but I'm getting it back very slow.

1533
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:15,150
Speaker 1: So seeing Emily do this panel and animation was like going to a lecture on animation because she is an expert at animation in the way that we were experts at like computer stuff.

1534
01:18:15,752 --> 01:18:15,953
Speaker 0: Yep.

1535
01:18:16,556 --> 01:18:20,792
Speaker 1: And it was like the same, you know, professional slides, professional jargon and explanation.

1536
01:18:20,832 --> 01:18:21,394
Speaker 1: It was just great.

1537
01:18:22,217 --> 01:18:26,574
Speaker 1: And Katsu did ask the Kendo master, you know, the Q and a for Kendo getting into it.

1538
01:18:26,675 --> 01:18:32,622
Speaker 1: We had Scott Johnson and I believe other people, I didn't see the panel talk about, you know, actually what it takes to go from.

1539
01:18:32,642 --> 01:18:35,433
Speaker 1: I go to anime cons to, I run anime.

1540
01:18:35,453 --> 01:18:36,297
Speaker 0: Is that what he talked about?

1541
01:18:36,317 --> 01:18:37,483
Speaker 0: I'm still not sure what he talked about.

1542
01:18:37,503 --> 01:18:41,806
Speaker 1: That's what he talked about because he went from going to anime cons to running anime cards, much like us.

1543
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:45,840
Speaker 1: Moet anthropomorphism ton was very popular.

1544
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:46,945
Speaker 0: That was part of that panel.

1545
01:18:46,965 --> 01:18:51,712
Speaker 1: That was Emily and Katsu talking about all that Moet and throw good tons there.

1546
01:18:52,392 --> 01:19:00,004
Speaker 1: So the action castle reprise Jared was gone and as a result, yeah, see, there you go.

1547
01:19:00,044 --> 01:19:02,357
Speaker 0: We scheduled him for something that he didn't show for him.

1548
01:19:02,498 --> 01:19:03,221
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's true.

1549
01:19:03,241 --> 01:19:03,402
Speaker 1: Okay.

1550
01:19:03,863 --> 01:19:07,034
Speaker 1: And a character building character burning workshop.

1551
01:19:07,615 --> 01:19:13,232
Speaker 1: Now we had nothing planned for either of these and we did not have Jared to run action castle.

1552
01:19:13,974 --> 01:19:16,382
Speaker 1: We cannot run action castle.

1553
01:19:16,442 --> 01:19:20,662
Speaker 0: I mean, my, I did a daring dungeon, but I did it for people who had never played action castle.

1554
01:19:20,943 --> 01:19:27,345
Speaker 0: So they didn't realize how poor facsimile it was, but now I've actually seen a seeing action castle again and studying it.

1555
01:19:27,868 --> 01:19:30,720
Speaker 0: I think I can, you know, apparently they also have a jungle adventure.

1556
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,171
Speaker 1: I can tell you one thing about making an action castle.

1557
01:19:33,372 --> 01:19:33,915
Speaker 0: I can make it.

1558
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:41,251
Speaker 0: I feel that I can do an action castle now because there was the acting component of it that I was not incorporating and such well to memorize and you have to memorize.

1559
01:19:41,351 --> 01:19:46,916
Speaker 0: I'm going to memorize it no matter what I'm going to make and think it was action castles a lot simpler than I remember it being.

1560
01:19:47,338 --> 01:19:50,496
Speaker 0: My daring dungeon was really complicated and I think that was part of the problem.

1561
01:19:50,516 --> 01:19:55,238
Speaker 0: I'm going to come up with a much simpler one and you'll see I'm going to, it's going to be my own thing.

1562
01:19:55,258 --> 01:19:56,665
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'll do daring dungeon though.

1563
01:19:56,686 --> 01:19:58,294
Speaker 0: I might make a space adventure.

1564
01:19:58,314 --> 01:20:00,785
Speaker 1: I still want to make bastard castle and sinking ship.

1565
01:20:01,107 --> 01:20:02,091
Speaker 0: No sinking ship.

1566
01:20:02,633 --> 01:20:09,551
Speaker 1: Those are my two, but the one thing I can say about making an action castle, it takes a long time.

1567
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:14,283
Speaker 1: So a million people showed up to this and we had nothing.

1568
01:20:14,323 --> 01:20:20,302
Speaker 1: So we decided to try out something that we had talked about, but we weren't sure if it was feasible.

1569
01:20:20,363 --> 01:20:25,443
Speaker 1: Like we talk about this a lot and we wanted to run it at a con, but we never worked out the logistics.

1570
01:20:25,764 --> 01:20:33,370
Speaker 1: We never figured out, like we never did the analysis of can this work on a stage and I gave it a 50 50 shot if it was feasible at all.

1571
01:20:33,791 --> 01:20:36,862
Speaker 1: So we've ran a burning wheel demo for the audience.

1572
01:20:37,323 --> 01:20:43,346
Speaker 1: We basically had two people who do burning wheel and two people who had never played burning wheel in their lives.

1573
01:20:43,647 --> 01:20:45,255
Speaker 1: One of whom had never even heard of burning wheel.

1574
01:20:45,536 --> 01:20:45,878
Speaker 0: Yep.

1575
01:20:46,059 --> 01:20:47,103
Speaker 0: Awesome staff guy.

1576
01:20:47,123 --> 01:20:49,410
Speaker 0: Uh, Phil, me and rim.

1577
01:20:49,731 --> 01:20:52,198
Speaker 0: Now Alex was GM and Alex did a real good job.

1578
01:20:52,279 --> 01:20:53,967
Speaker 1: Luke crane would have done it, but he had to leave.

1579
01:20:54,007 --> 01:20:55,174
Speaker 1: He couldn't stick around for Sunday.

1580
01:20:55,194 --> 01:20:56,120
Speaker 0: He left Saturday night.

1581
01:20:56,642 --> 01:21:01,739
Speaker 1: We kind of just tried running this for a crowd and let me tell you, the crowd loved it.

1582
01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:05,052
Speaker 1: It'll take almost nothing to turn this into a real event.

1583
01:21:05,454 --> 01:21:06,619
Speaker 0: I did a really good job too.

1584
01:21:06,759 --> 01:21:15,412
Speaker 1: Well, well to a degree, Scott had like all these plans to win as the elf, but I was the rat, which was a big fucking mistake for all you other people.

1585
01:21:15,452 --> 01:21:25,343
Speaker 1: Because as Lou crane told me, the rat is the most difficult character in the sword to play, but the rat's the easiest as far as I'm concerned.

1586
01:21:25,704 --> 01:21:31,525
Speaker 1: There is a almost surefire way to win as the red, unless the other people are privy to the knowledge.

1587
01:21:32,027 --> 01:21:35,520
Speaker 1: So I basically got Scott, the elf and the dwarf to kill each other.

1588
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,283
Speaker 0: It was so crazy.

1589
01:21:36,303 --> 01:21:38,593
Speaker 0: Cause I basically said I went all out, right?

1590
01:21:38,713 --> 01:21:42,550
Speaker 0: I was like, I just used everything in my power to fucking get that sword right first.

1591
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:45,663
Speaker 0: I use my persona point to pay the rat and it fucking worked.

1592
01:21:45,844 --> 01:21:47,030
Speaker 1: Not big mistake.

1593
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:51,834
Speaker 1: You fucked up right there because as soon as you pay me, I don't care one shit about you anymore.

1594
01:21:51,854 --> 01:21:52,860
Speaker 1: I already have the money in hand.

1595
01:21:53,081 --> 01:21:55,188
Speaker 0: No, my mistake wasn't paying the rat.

1596
01:21:55,308 --> 01:22:00,667
Speaker 0: It was that when I, afterwards in my duel with the dwarf, I appealed to the rat.

1597
01:22:00,727 --> 01:22:03,036
Speaker 0: I should have appealed to the human, right?

1598
01:22:03,197 --> 01:22:13,298
Speaker 0: I could've done, I could've gotten the human to help me out and demolish the, uh, the dwarf even more, you know, and the fact that the dwarf did some damage to my body of argument meant I had to compromise.

1599
01:22:13,338 --> 01:22:28,978
Speaker 0: If I could've just demolished him completely, like I was going to, thanks to his, you know, uh, failed in sight, which gave me plus 11 D. then, uh, you know, it would have been a much better outcome because he wouldn't have been able to, you know, I wouldn't be able to get the sword.

1600
01:22:29,018 --> 01:22:32,214
Speaker 0: And as soon as I get the sword, I just stabbed the human and get the fuck out.

1601
01:22:32,395 --> 01:22:38,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no, you got stabbed in the kidney and then, but then all of circles.

1602
01:22:38,094 --> 01:22:38,977
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

1603
01:22:38,997 --> 01:22:42,871
Speaker 0: I think that there's something about the sword that if you try circles, it just always works.

1604
01:22:43,493 --> 01:22:48,835
Speaker 1: So you see circles up his brother, his brother, the swordsman and the dwarf and that guy stab each other.

1605
01:22:48,855 --> 01:22:50,763
Speaker 1: And then me and the human just take the sword and leave.

1606
01:22:50,783 --> 01:22:53,616
Speaker 0: These guys got that fucking dwarf that piece of shit.

1607
01:22:54,198 --> 01:22:55,944
Speaker 1: You guys are laying there bleeding to death.

1608
01:22:55,984 --> 01:22:57,769
Speaker 1: Just, ah, fuck you.

1609
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:58,632
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

1610
01:22:58,993 --> 01:22:59,655
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

1611
01:22:59,815 --> 01:23:00,136
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1612
01:23:00,978 --> 01:23:10,100
Speaker 1: But we pulled it off and we now know it is perfectly feasible to run a live demo of the sword in front of a crowd.

1613
01:23:10,281 --> 01:23:17,802
Speaker 1: All we need are slides of character sheets and volleys to put up on the projectors and microphones.

1614
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:18,545
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1615
01:23:18,605 --> 01:23:22,157
Speaker 1: Microphones and some either a webcam or something.

1616
01:23:22,217 --> 01:23:25,711
Speaker 1: I'd like to have a top down view of the die rolls for the crowd.

1617
01:23:25,912 --> 01:23:26,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be good.

1618
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:27,800
Speaker 1: Other than that, it's set.

1619
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,870
Speaker 1: So we're going to run this at some bigger con in the future.

1620
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,618
Speaker 0: Hopefully maybe Pax East.

1621
01:23:31,658 --> 01:23:33,225
Speaker 0: We'll see require some logistics.

1622
01:23:33,586 --> 01:23:33,767
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1623
01:23:33,827 --> 01:23:36,939
Speaker 1: But if we have like Lou Crane at Pax East, we can do it.

1624
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:37,742
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

1625
01:23:38,243 --> 01:23:46,493
Speaker 1: So after that was the character burning workshop, which they put a character building workshop in the top level schedule.

1626
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,742
Speaker 1: But it was the real description in the rest of the schedule.

1627
01:23:49,405 --> 01:23:53,382
Speaker 1: I felt bad for these like eight cosplay people who came expecting something very different.

1628
01:23:54,165 --> 01:23:54,426
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1629
01:23:54,646 --> 01:23:56,733
Speaker 0: But actually, you know, it was sort of haphazard.

1630
01:23:57,135 --> 01:23:59,706
Speaker 0: But like as it went on, it actually started to work.

1631
01:23:59,726 --> 01:23:59,967
Speaker 0: I was.

1632
01:24:00,108 --> 01:24:00,932
Speaker 0: I was very surprised.

1633
01:24:00,992 --> 01:24:01,294
Speaker 1: Another.

1634
01:24:01,394 --> 01:24:03,424
Speaker 1: We're not sure if this was really feasible event.

1635
01:24:03,444 --> 01:24:04,086
Speaker 1: Let's try it.

1636
01:24:04,307 --> 01:24:05,491
Speaker 1: And we had Luke or not Luke.

1637
01:24:05,511 --> 01:24:08,643
Speaker 1: We had Pete and Wyatt and I sat up there with them.

1638
01:24:09,305 --> 01:24:13,379
Speaker 1: And I think what made it, in my opinion, was me being awesome and being awesome.

1639
01:24:14,361 --> 01:24:17,960
Speaker 1: Because, you see, I had the laptop and I was losing my voice, you know, finally on Sunday.

1640
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,814
Speaker 1: Radio voice can only hold out for so long, yelling for like 40 hours straight.

1641
01:24:22,396 --> 01:24:25,127
Speaker 1: So I put the laptop up on the projector, opened up like Abby Ward.

1642
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:29,586
Speaker 1: And as we as a group, you know, with the audience created this character.

1643
01:24:30,129 --> 01:24:32,280
Speaker 1: By the way, I'm going to post the character online when I get a chance.

1644
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:34,329
Speaker 1: We had a really awesome character from nothing.

1645
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:35,434
Speaker 0: Pretty good character.

1646
01:24:35,555 --> 01:24:36,680
Speaker 0: That's how life paths work.

1647
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:42,807
Speaker 1: Like by the end of this, everyone who wasn't interested in burning wheel was basically like they were going to go buy the books as soon as they got home.

1648
01:24:43,972 --> 01:24:48,210
Speaker 0: But we made this character with the is actually Luke Crane told me there was.

1649
01:24:48,571 --> 01:24:52,386
Speaker 0: the thing is there's some game sellers, you know, in the Connecticut dealers room.

1650
01:24:52,968 --> 01:24:56,360
Speaker 0: And, you know, they have indie RPGs, some of them, quite a few of them.

1651
01:24:56,380 --> 01:25:04,410
Speaker 0: In fact, one guy who had burning wheels sold all his copies, went to get more for Saturday and then went to get more for Sunday.

1652
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:06,540
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, you know, he sold them all every day.

1653
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:08,967
Speaker 1: So I'm very happy about that.

1654
01:25:08,987 --> 01:25:09,568
Speaker 0: That's good.

1655
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:14,907
Speaker 1: But what I did is I did a style of humor that I've never really done at conventions.

1656
01:25:15,129 --> 01:25:26,060
Speaker 1: I'm shooting my own horn a little bit here, but I think it's justified because I had people laughing their asses off while Pete and Wyatt are trying to serious business Lee kind of run this character burning workshop and get the crowd into it.

1657
01:25:26,901 --> 01:25:31,075
Speaker 1: All I did was type stuff on the on the screen while they talked.

1658
01:25:31,657 --> 01:25:38,520
Speaker 1: And let me tell you, it is very easy to get people to laugh by typing the word prostitute periodically throughout.

1659
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:47,400
Speaker 0: Maybe we should do some sort of high concept panel where it's two screens, two projectors, two laptops, and we're just typing or maybe we just bring up a Google Wave and we type.

1660
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:55,546
Speaker 1: I like the idea of some sort of iron, some sort of panel where you have people who have to do a panel kind of on the fly.

1661
01:25:56,007 --> 01:25:59,600
Speaker 1: But in the meantime, there is running commentary on two projectors.

1662
01:25:59,881 --> 01:26:06,288
Speaker 1: that is just text in a file from like me and Scott, Sadler and Waldorf, something like that.

1663
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:09,679
Speaker 1: But anyway, we also it worked really well.

1664
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:15,883
Speaker 1: You know, we got the crowd into it and we had them kind of think about a character just by following the rules of burning wheel.

1665
01:26:15,903 --> 01:26:18,271
Speaker 1: We made this bad ass character in about an hour.

1666
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:19,857
Speaker 0: All right.

1667
01:26:19,998 --> 01:26:25,363
Speaker 0: So other notable things from Connecticut, there were these two people who really wanted to play burning wheel real bad.

1668
01:26:25,423 --> 01:26:27,454
Speaker 0: And a lot of people did get to play burning wheel.

1669
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:31,830
Speaker 0: I think he said he ran like five swords, if not more, you know.

1670
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:34,037
Speaker 1: And that was just Luke, not counting Alex.

1671
01:26:34,157 --> 01:26:37,695
Speaker 0: Alex ran some, and then they gave burning wheel stickers to everyone who played.

1672
01:26:37,715 --> 01:26:39,204
Speaker 0: And I saw a lot of stickers around.

1673
01:26:39,244 --> 01:26:40,471
Speaker 0: So a lot of people got to play.

1674
01:26:40,492 --> 01:26:45,637
Speaker 0: That's a brilliant idea, because one everyone we're doing that we got to get stickers before the next, before packs.

1675
01:26:45,778 --> 01:26:46,783
Speaker 1: This is so brilliant.

1676
01:26:46,823 --> 01:26:48,592
Speaker 1: And conventions need to do this in a big way.

1677
01:26:48,633 --> 01:26:50,201
Speaker 1: But we are going to capitalize on it first.

1678
01:26:50,562 --> 01:26:52,410
Speaker 0: Get a gigantic stick in a row.

1679
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:54,096
Speaker 0: Say she's making you guys pins or something.

1680
01:26:54,116 --> 01:26:54,839
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

1681
01:26:55,482 --> 01:26:55,823
Speaker 1: Yes.

1682
01:26:56,184 --> 01:26:56,586
Speaker 1: Yes.

1683
01:26:56,827 --> 01:27:02,992
Speaker 1: But what Luke would do is if you played in a demo of burning wheel, you got a burning wheel sticker and you stuck it on your badge.

1684
01:27:03,374 --> 01:27:04,460
Speaker 1: Now, think about what this does.

1685
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:12,370
Speaker 1: One, it prevents multiple people from getting multiple demos, different DMS and taking up time to it reminds people.

1686
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:12,892
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

1687
01:27:12,912 --> 01:27:14,478
Speaker 1: Burning wheel and any role playing games.

1688
01:27:14,538 --> 01:27:15,583
Speaker 1: And then they'll go buy it when they get home.

1689
01:27:16,487 --> 01:27:19,681
Speaker 1: Three, you're walking around the con and people say, hey, what's that sticker?

1690
01:27:20,203 --> 01:27:25,841
Speaker 1: And one thing I found is that much like with Princess Tutu, much like the Pokemon stamp rally.

1691
01:27:26,162 --> 01:27:27,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also Princess Tutu.

1692
01:27:28,088 --> 01:27:35,594
Speaker 1: When we get people excited about something, if someone else asks them about that thing, the excitedness transfers over.

1693
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:37,040
Speaker 1: Hey, man, what's the sticker?

1694
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,663
Speaker 1: Well, you don't know about burning wheel.

1695
01:27:39,906 --> 01:27:41,429
Speaker 0: I can burn away a bitch.

1696
01:27:42,372 --> 01:27:43,655
Speaker 0: All right.

1697
01:27:44,817 --> 01:27:47,044
Speaker 1: But three, three things.

1698
01:27:47,706 --> 01:27:53,404
Speaker 1: What it does is if I have the sticker and I see someone else with the sticker, you want to get the stick?

1699
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:54,328
Speaker 1: No, no.

1700
01:27:54,549 --> 01:27:55,252
Speaker 1: I have the sticker.

1701
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:55,996
Speaker 1: He has the sticker.

1702
01:27:56,257 --> 01:27:57,141
Speaker 1: We don't know each other.

1703
01:27:57,221 --> 01:27:58,406
Speaker 1: We're just at this car.

1704
01:27:58,426 --> 01:28:03,706
Speaker 1: Oh, that suddenly two people who are into indie role playing games find each other and become friends.

1705
01:28:04,007 --> 01:28:04,268
Speaker 0: Yep.

1706
01:28:05,272 --> 01:28:05,754
Speaker 0: It's all good.

1707
01:28:05,774 --> 01:28:08,364
Speaker 0: So there are these two people, though, who wanted to play.

1708
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:15,796
Speaker 0: And like, you know, usually when this sort of happens at conventions, you see someone and you like you want to do something, but you can't schedule it.

1709
01:28:15,856 --> 01:28:16,138
Speaker 0: Right.

1710
01:28:16,278 --> 01:28:17,665
Speaker 0: So it's like they really wanted to play.

1711
01:28:17,685 --> 01:28:20,317
Speaker 0: So I promised them, all right, we'll play Sunday, I swear.

1712
01:28:20,337 --> 01:28:20,458
Speaker 0: Right.

1713
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:25,803
Speaker 0: So, you know, Luke Crane had already left by the time and, you know, such and such just like, we're going to do it.

1714
01:28:26,124 --> 01:28:27,813
Speaker 0: I'm not going to let you leave without playing.

1715
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:34,063
Speaker 0: And we tried real hard and like they just disappeared and we didn't see them again, even though we like waited for them and tried to find.

1716
01:28:34,183 --> 01:28:39,928
Speaker 1: I tweeted just in case I tried to get him to come if they were still around to Action Castle because we were going to run.

1717
01:28:39,989 --> 01:28:41,898
Speaker 0: I think they left at noonish or something.

1718
01:28:41,959 --> 01:28:42,240
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1719
01:28:43,364 --> 01:28:46,818
Speaker 0: They just disappeared and we couldn't make it happen, even though we tried real hard.

1720
01:28:46,879 --> 01:28:47,882
Speaker 0: So email.

1721
01:28:47,983 --> 01:28:54,305
Speaker 0: normally it's like I would blame myself because I promised that I was trying to make it happen for those people.

1722
01:28:54,386 --> 01:28:55,330
Speaker 0: But you know what?

1723
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:55,993
Speaker 0: They disappeared.

1724
01:28:56,053 --> 01:28:57,400
Speaker 0: I waited by the RPG room.

1725
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:58,063
Speaker 0: They didn't show up.

1726
01:28:58,244 --> 01:28:58,947
Speaker 0: So you know what?

1727
01:28:58,967 --> 01:28:59,550
Speaker 0: I'm going to blame them.

1728
01:28:59,651 --> 01:29:00,053
Speaker 1: It's tough.

1729
01:29:00,475 --> 01:29:01,822
Speaker 1: Email us and I'm sure we'll see you.

1730
01:29:01,842 --> 01:29:03,330
Speaker 0: We'll see you at another convention.

1731
01:29:03,411 --> 01:29:12,288
Speaker 0: And if I do see you at another convention, I'll pretty much just drop, you know, and if nothing else, I'll just drop everything immediately unless it's I'm on a panel.

1732
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:17,268
Speaker 0: And I will personally run it for you if I have to, because, you know, that's how it goes.

1733
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:26,828
Speaker 1: So we put a panel feedback session in and because our schedule was shifted a little bit by the time it conflicted with the real feedback session, which is not intentional.

1734
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:27,753
Speaker 1: But that was fine.

1735
01:29:27,873 --> 01:29:34,824
Speaker 1: A lot of people came to the panel feedback session, gave a lot of feedback, and it was the first time to listen to any nasty masquerade feedbacks.

1736
01:29:35,106 --> 01:29:40,110
Speaker 1: It is the first time I have been able to be on the feedback session as opposed to being at the feedback session.

1737
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:42,162
Speaker 0: I think I'm real good at being on the feedback panel.

1738
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:42,745
Speaker 1: I think so, too.

1739
01:29:42,786 --> 01:29:43,288
Speaker 1: And you know what?

1740
01:29:43,851 --> 01:29:44,616
Speaker 1: It was real fun.

1741
01:29:44,676 --> 01:29:50,000
Speaker 1: But at the same time, you know, that vibe at Otacon like there's a certain vibe at the feedback session of the people on stage.

1742
01:29:50,881 --> 01:29:55,435
Speaker 1: And I suddenly had that vibe in me like it was weird.

1743
01:29:55,475 --> 01:29:58,828
Speaker 0: how suddenly it really because I sort of noticed a different vibe, right?

1744
01:29:58,868 --> 01:30:04,352
Speaker 0: Because it was like I was thinking about the Otacon vibe, you know, the way that people are up on the feedback panel being like.

1745
01:30:04,372 --> 01:30:08,254
Speaker 0: But I was just like, you know, shooting the shit, being totally honest with people.

1746
01:30:08,314 --> 01:30:11,770
Speaker 0: I was like a guy was like, hey, how come, you know, there's not more 18 plus stuff.

1747
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:14,402
Speaker 0: I'm like, first, regardless of legalities, right.

1748
01:30:14,422 --> 01:30:19,063
Speaker 0: We don't want the newspaper to say tomorrow, you know, Connecticut and showing porn to kids.

1749
01:30:19,143 --> 01:30:19,444
Speaker 0: Right.

1750
01:30:19,605 --> 01:30:26,872
Speaker 0: So I was just, you know, and I felt it was I was being a lot more open with the people and, you know, less talking down to him.

1751
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:34,746
Speaker 1: One thing that worked really well was we did the thing that we tell Otacon to do they never do is we had the projector showing all the feedback that had already been given.

1752
01:30:34,766 --> 01:30:39,387
Speaker 1: And before we let people give feedback, we told them about the things we already knew about.

1753
01:30:39,769 --> 01:30:48,888
Speaker 0: Like every time someone gave feedback about something, rim typed it into the word processor and that was up on the projector so everyone could see everything that had been talked about.

1754
01:30:49,169 --> 01:30:52,281
Speaker 0: And when we were done, we had a document that contained all the feedback.

1755
01:30:52,562 --> 01:30:53,444
Speaker 0: How convenient.

1756
01:30:54,988 --> 01:30:57,033
Speaker 0: So obvious, yet no one does it except us.

1757
01:30:57,915 --> 01:30:58,095
Speaker 1: Yep.

1758
01:30:58,476 --> 01:31:01,345
Speaker 1: But after that, you know, everything went smooth.

1759
01:31:01,406 --> 01:31:02,872
Speaker 1: We packed up all our stuff.

1760
01:31:03,314 --> 01:31:05,203
Speaker 1: We had somehow survived the whole apocalypse.

1761
01:31:05,423 --> 01:31:09,360
Speaker 1: We went out and got an awesome dinner in the town next door where there's actually food.

1762
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:09,681
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1763
01:31:09,741 --> 01:31:11,413
Speaker 0: People don't understand Hartford, Connecticut.

1764
01:31:11,434 --> 01:31:13,444
Speaker 0: Hartford, Connecticut is the capital of Connecticut.

1765
01:31:13,485 --> 01:31:13,645
Speaker 0: Right.

1766
01:31:13,705 --> 01:31:20,570
Speaker 0: As East Hartford, which is the ghetto and it has West Hartford, which is basically also the city proper.

1767
01:31:20,771 --> 01:31:20,992
Speaker 0: Right.

1768
01:31:21,052 --> 01:31:29,323
Speaker 0: Downtown Hartford is all these big office buildings, but there's nothing under like in New York City, the bottom of an office building has stuff.

1769
01:31:29,605 --> 01:31:29,866
Speaker 0: Right.

1770
01:31:29,886 --> 01:31:35,190
Speaker 0: It's like if you walk down the street, there'll be clothing stores and delis and all sorts of stuff.

1771
01:31:35,271 --> 01:31:35,532
Speaker 0: Right.

1772
01:31:36,094 --> 01:31:43,632
Speaker 0: If you walk down the street in Hartford, it's just concrete and the entrance to the big office building and concrete and the entrance to an office building.

1773
01:31:43,652 --> 01:31:44,014
Speaker 0: And that's it.

1774
01:31:44,034 --> 01:31:46,325
Speaker 0: It's just office buildings and government buildings.

1775
01:31:46,345 --> 01:31:48,313
Speaker 0: There's no stuff on the street.

1776
01:31:48,635 --> 01:31:53,961
Speaker 0: I mean, even the Empire State Building, it's like, you know, frigging comic book stores in it and shit and restaurants and all who knows what else.

1777
01:31:54,001 --> 01:31:54,242
Speaker 0: Right.

1778
01:31:54,764 --> 01:31:58,334
Speaker 0: But, you know, the in Hartford, nothing.

1779
01:31:58,695 --> 01:32:10,173
Speaker 0: So the way Hartford works is you have all these office buildings and all these people work in and all those people live either in East Hartford and to get to or in West Hartford, the rich ass suburbs.

1780
01:32:10,433 --> 01:32:25,551
Speaker 0: So, of course, on our way out of Connecticut, right, we go to West Hartford, where all the rich people live, where all the nice restaurants are to get dinner because there is nowhere to eat in Hartford because all the office buildings go all the way to the ground and there's nothing in them.

1781
01:32:26,293 --> 01:32:28,703
Speaker 0: So lots of fancy restaurants going over there.

1782
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:32,699
Speaker 0: But the Maggie Moo's was closed and we were not able to get cake ice cream.

1783
01:32:33,781 --> 01:32:36,032
Speaker 1: Luckily, cake ice cream is now in the grocery store.

1784
01:32:36,212 --> 01:32:39,105
Speaker 0: Actually, I bought banana split ice cream when the show was over.

1785
01:32:39,125 --> 01:32:39,768
Speaker 0: I'm going to eat some.

1786
01:32:40,732 --> 01:32:47,777
Speaker 1: But all things considered, we basically packed panels nonstop in a panel five for the entirety of Connecticut without issue.

1787
01:32:48,038 --> 01:32:55,586
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think, though, next year, Connecticut, I think we should have, you know, maybe like one or two fewer panel rooms bigger.

1788
01:32:55,807 --> 01:32:58,800
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe we'll just combine two of the small ones into one more big one.

1789
01:32:59,161 --> 01:33:01,774
Speaker 0: You know, that way we'll have one of their five rooms, I think six rooms.

1790
01:33:02,196 --> 01:33:04,767
Speaker 1: There were five panel rooms and three workshop rooms.

1791
01:33:04,828 --> 01:33:08,061
Speaker 1: I think what I want, I'm thinking four panel rooms and two workshop.

1792
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:13,478
Speaker 1: I want one big panel room for smaller panel rooms and then two workshops.

1793
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:16,611
Speaker 0: I'm thinking of maybe a big a medium and two smalls.

1794
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:17,696
Speaker 1: We might not be able to do that.

1795
01:33:17,736 --> 01:33:18,560
Speaker 1: It depends on the it does.

1796
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:20,809
Speaker 0: We got to look at the layout of the building.

1797
01:33:20,889 --> 01:33:23,842
Speaker 0: But, you know, yes, four or five instead of six, maybe.

1798
01:33:23,922 --> 01:33:26,331
Speaker 0: And then two workshops instead of three.

1799
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:28,359
Speaker 0: You know, I think I think it'll work out.

1800
01:33:28,539 --> 01:33:37,580
Speaker 1: But suffice it to say, one, I got to give huge props and thanks to everyone in the front row crew who gave panels and every one of everyone related to the front row crew who gave panels.

1801
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,249
Speaker 1: We really couldn't have done this without you guys.

1802
01:33:39,269 --> 01:33:43,451
Speaker 0: Yeah, we thank the Luke cranes and the Jared's and the Connecticut people, Emily

1803
01:33:43,471 --> 01:33:48,256
Speaker 1: and Luke and Alex and Pete and White and Scott and Laura and all the people on the crew, Uncle Yo, everyone who did all those panels

1804
01:33:48,337 --> 01:33:53,013
Speaker 0: and the staff guy and the tech guy and who helped us out in the room.

1805
01:33:53,033 --> 01:33:57,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Connecticut staff were pretty much pretty awesome and bad as the whole time.

1806
01:33:57,369 --> 01:34:00,462
Speaker 0: Yeah, Nury, even though she was mostly in the deals room.

1807
01:34:00,542 --> 01:34:00,743
Speaker 1: Yep.

1808
01:34:01,085 --> 01:34:01,366
Speaker 1: We had.

1809
01:34:01,526 --> 01:34:05,301
Speaker 1: we've had a whole bunch of cool listeners like your Lord Yupo was hanging out in the room.

1810
01:34:05,342 --> 01:34:09,796
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the listeners who came and made the room look more full.

1811
01:34:09,816 --> 01:34:13,371
Speaker 1: I forget a lot of your names, which is why I didn't say any more names.

1812
01:34:13,412 --> 01:34:15,623
Speaker 0: The strange people who asked us to sign things.

1813
01:34:15,663 --> 01:34:16,687
Speaker 0: You are very strange.

1814
01:34:17,069 --> 01:34:17,692
Speaker 1: I think it's cool.

1815
01:34:17,872 --> 01:34:18,937
Speaker 1: People seem to like the posters.

1816
01:34:19,339 --> 01:34:22,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that's about a Connecticut.

1817
01:34:22,789 --> 01:34:24,997
Speaker 0: It's the everything gone next year.

1818
01:34:25,037 --> 01:34:25,720
Speaker 0: We're in charge.

1819
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,308
Speaker 0: We're going to try to make awesome happen.

1820
01:34:27,932 --> 01:34:32,653
Speaker 0: You know, we had to do is you have to basically get as much money as we can to basically bring people in.

1821
01:34:32,713 --> 01:34:39,745
Speaker 0: That way we could, you know, pretty much my plan for Connecticut next year, panels and workshops wise, because we could bring in like the crew.

1822
01:34:40,087 --> 01:34:40,348
Speaker 0: Right.

1823
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:43,040
Speaker 0: And then maybe we could bring in like, you know, Ninja Consultants or something.

1824
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,087
Speaker 0: We could do mad panels like a ton.

1825
01:34:45,408 --> 01:34:48,599
Speaker 1: I basically want to split panel programming three ways.

1826
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:54,076
Speaker 1: One third anime and comics, you know, including web comics and also manga.

1827
01:34:54,256 --> 01:34:56,605
Speaker 1: This is not counting web comic and guest panels.

1828
01:34:56,645 --> 01:35:00,682
Speaker 0: That's kind of a separate one gaming video gaming tabletop board game role playing game.

1829
01:35:00,763 --> 01:35:02,651
Speaker 1: and one third just cool geeky stuff.

1830
01:35:02,691 --> 01:35:07,250
Speaker 1: Like I've got someone lined up who might be able to do a really cool interactive robotics workshop.

1831
01:35:07,471 --> 01:35:07,953
Speaker 0: Very nice.

1832
01:35:08,796 --> 01:35:14,014
Speaker 1: We've got someone who could probably do some really cool parkour workshops, parkour workshop.

1833
01:35:14,034 --> 01:35:15,940
Speaker 0: You can't do that in the con, really?

1834
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:18,064
Speaker 0: Well, you could do it in the ballroom.

1835
01:35:18,124 --> 01:35:20,309
Speaker 1: You can do a parkour workshop of demonstration.

1836
01:35:20,329 --> 01:35:28,760
Speaker 1: That's center outside of Connecticut with no relation to Connecticut whatsoever.

1837
01:35:29,161 --> 01:35:30,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's where they hurt themselves.

1838
01:35:31,049 --> 01:35:31,190
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1839
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:37,137
Speaker 0: I mean, I think, you know, we're going to schedule like we should schedule all sorts of like activities like that in the ballroom.

1840
01:35:37,539 --> 01:35:40,494
Speaker 0: And then, you know, maybe we could have like, you know, one less panel room.

1841
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:45,796
Speaker 1: that, you know, bigger panel room instead that like belly dancing needs to be in the ballroom where there's stuff for it.

1842
01:35:45,877 --> 01:35:46,620
Speaker 1: And there was.

1843
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:49,091
Speaker 0: there were things scheduled in the ballroom like DuckDuckGoose.

1844
01:35:49,413 --> 01:35:49,574
Speaker 1: Yep.

1845
01:35:49,614 --> 01:35:54,837
Speaker 0: But basically, I don't know why they had that there, but we, yes, we're going to schedule a kendo over there.

1846
01:35:54,857 --> 01:35:57,469
Speaker 1: We're going to schedule as much cool stuff as we can over there.

1847
01:35:57,529 --> 01:36:02,911
Speaker 1: And I know we can get away with a lot of this because people can already get away with like the Bafa tournament.

1848
01:36:03,493 --> 01:36:07,731
Speaker 0: So we, as they can do the Bafa tournament, we can do kendo in the ballroom.

1849
01:36:07,771 --> 01:36:10,845
Speaker 1: We're going to sign whatever forms we need to sign to make all this awesome stuff happen.

1850
01:36:10,906 --> 01:36:13,698
Speaker 1: And Connecticut is going to be amazing next year.

1851
01:36:13,718 --> 01:36:15,346
Speaker 0: That's something that Otacon doesn't do right.

1852
01:36:15,446 --> 01:36:21,809
Speaker 0: Otacon is the rave, but basically during the day before the rave happens, like that is basically autograph lineup area.

1853
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:22,290
Speaker 0: Right.

1854
01:36:23,173 --> 01:36:35,397
Speaker 0: They could run actual like panels there, like, you know, like any demonstration that requires anything physical, you know, like a belly dancing or a pair of teaching or a kendo or something, something.

1855
01:36:35,698 --> 01:36:40,360
Speaker 1: Or they could just do like packs and have the one panel room that's kind of open and just have open panels in there.

1856
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:40,761
Speaker 0: Yep.

1857
01:36:41,364 --> 01:36:41,665
Speaker 0: That's cool.

1858
01:36:41,685 --> 01:36:42,468
Speaker 0: All right.

1859
01:36:42,508 --> 01:36:47,111
Speaker 1: We've gone on long enough and we talk mostly about ourselves, but that's all we did at Connecticut.

1860
01:36:47,131 --> 01:36:51,800
Speaker 0: If you want a review of Connecticut, I'm sure there might've been someone else there who's going to podcast.

1861
01:36:52,080 --> 01:37:03,688
Speaker 1: I basically just from now on other convention reviews will be more like in traditional ones, but from this day forth, Connecticut counter views are going to be us talking about ourselves and about Connecticut and about the backend.

1862
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:05,195
Speaker 1: That's it.

1863
01:37:05,315 --> 01:37:10,580
Speaker 1: We're never going to do anything at Connecticut ever again, except run like panels and programming and all that business.

1864
01:37:11,002 --> 01:37:11,182
Speaker 0: Yep.

1865
01:37:12,046 --> 01:37:13,392
Speaker 0: So you had, there, you have it.

1866
01:37:13,653 --> 01:37:15,080
Speaker 0: I'm going to go eat some ice cream.

1867
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:21,850
Speaker 1: If you think you have what it takes to be a panelist at Connecticut, cause let me tell you the bar is being raised.

1868
01:37:22,251 --> 01:37:22,412
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1869
01:37:22,452 --> 01:37:27,677
Speaker 0: You got, I mean, you know, I can understand, you know, there's some kids out there, you know, they're inspired by us to run some panels.

1870
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:27,959
Speaker 0: Right.

1871
01:37:28,019 --> 01:37:30,729
Speaker 0: But listen, you have to be good, right.

1872
01:37:30,749 --> 01:37:32,275
Speaker 0: To run a panel, right?

1873
01:37:32,315 --> 01:37:41,273
Speaker 0: Like prove if you got to, if we don't know who you are and you don't have a panel resume already, you're going to have to prove to us somehow that you can be here to run a good panel.

1874
01:37:41,393 --> 01:37:43,903
Speaker 1: Now point several people have done this in the past.

1875
01:37:43,943 --> 01:37:45,630
Speaker 1: So it's not like we're asking too much.

1876
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:47,296
Speaker 1: Just basically be awesome.

1877
01:37:47,517 --> 01:37:54,550
Speaker 0: There's a recording of, you know, doing a panel, like just turn your webcam on, record yourself, given the panel, you know, put it on YouTube.

1878
01:37:54,611 --> 01:37:57,506
Speaker 0: I don't, I'm not going to watch the whole thing, but I just need to watch like a few minutes.

1879
01:37:57,526 --> 01:37:59,537
Speaker 0: I'll be like, aha, this person knows how to present.

1880
01:37:59,678 --> 01:37:59,960
Speaker 0: All right.

1881
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,130
Speaker 0: You know, or show me your panel resume.

1882
01:38:03,191 --> 01:38:06,362
Speaker 0: Show me, look, I've done panels at my middle of nowhere con.

1883
01:38:06,884 --> 01:38:11,500
Speaker 0: Oh, also, uh, speaking of middle of nowhere con, one of our listeners from Kansas was there.

1884
01:38:11,801 --> 01:38:16,003
Speaker 0: He came all that way, even though I was like, whoa, dude, why'd you come all this way for a little Connecticut?

1885
01:38:16,024 --> 01:38:20,963
Speaker 0: But he looked like he had a good time and he saved my ass with an iPod charging cable.

1886
01:38:21,003 --> 01:38:23,452
Speaker 1: So mad, uh, that guy, that guy was pretty cool.

1887
01:38:23,573 --> 01:38:24,376
Speaker 0: That guy's awesome.

1888
01:38:25,018 --> 01:38:28,614
Speaker 1: Apparently trogdor was there, but he didn't go to, he didn't speak off at Pete's.

1889
01:38:28,695 --> 01:38:29,780
Speaker 1: Pete's, uh, metal panel.

1890
01:38:30,701 --> 01:38:32,631
Speaker 1: By the way, Pete's metal panel was awesome.

1891
01:38:32,651 --> 01:38:35,624
Speaker 1: The only thing it lacked was that Pete does not know how to make a playlist.

1892
01:38:36,667 --> 01:38:37,008
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1893
01:38:37,249 --> 01:38:39,275
Speaker 0: He's a little polished.

1894
01:38:39,295 --> 01:38:40,358
Speaker 0: His content is all right.

1895
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:40,679
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1896
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:42,686
Speaker 1: The thing is Pete's metal panel.

1897
01:38:43,108 --> 01:38:46,179
Speaker 1: Pete got punked at one point by none other than Luke Crane.

1898
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:48,207
Speaker 1: I want to bring this up.

1899
01:38:48,468 --> 01:38:49,513
Speaker 0: You know, Pete's metal.

1900
01:38:49,633 --> 01:38:50,658
Speaker 0: Luke Crane is more metal.

1901
01:38:50,798 --> 01:38:51,240
Speaker 0: I'm telling you.

1902
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,384
Speaker 1: He's pretty fucking metal.

1903
01:38:52,404 --> 01:38:53,187
Speaker 0: He's really metal.

1904
01:38:53,588 --> 01:39:00,598
Speaker 1: Luke Crane, you know, Pete had this amazing chart that was very like, it was actually, it was actually like, it wasn't just like a joke.

1905
01:39:00,658 --> 01:39:03,051
Speaker 0: It was actually legitimate chart that he actually started explaining.

1906
01:39:03,353 --> 01:39:04,037
Speaker 0: I was like, really?

1907
01:39:04,137 --> 01:39:04,600
Speaker 0: You're serious?

1908
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:06,728
Speaker 0: It's not just like putting up there for a joke.

1909
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:09,540
Speaker 1: It was on the surface a joke, but in reality not.

1910
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:18,149
Speaker 1: But he made the mistake of not considering anthrax when he showed the hip hop influence turning into anthrax turning into shitty nu metal.

1911
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:20,337
Speaker 0: Let's relaunch bastard and do a show on it.

1912
01:39:20,378 --> 01:39:30,962
Speaker 1: Oh my God, bastard is like, but Luke Crane raises his hand very politely and points out, I will paraphrase here.

1913
01:39:31,484 --> 01:39:32,767
Speaker 1: Pete, fuck you.

1914
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:34,452
Speaker 1: Anthrax is awesome.

1915
01:39:34,612 --> 01:39:37,340
Speaker 1: And all Pete could say was, you know what?

1916
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:38,782
Speaker 1: I fucked up.

1917
01:39:38,822 --> 01:39:39,223
Speaker 1: You're right.

1918
01:39:39,845 --> 01:39:40,808
Speaker 1: Anthrax is awesome.

1919
01:39:41,912 --> 01:39:45,663
Speaker 1: He needs like, you know, shitty nu metal in the corner of the slide.

1920
01:39:45,964 --> 01:39:48,250
Speaker 1: And then in parentheses, accept anthrax.

1921
01:39:49,855 --> 01:39:50,457
Speaker 1: Then we're cool.

1922
01:39:50,938 --> 01:39:51,259
Speaker 0: All right.

1923
01:39:51,299 --> 01:39:53,307
Speaker 0: So I think we're done with the show.

1924
01:39:53,327 --> 01:39:53,689
