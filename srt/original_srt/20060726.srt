1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,957
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday July 26th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:18,940
Speaker 0: tonight We give you an overview of all that is slayers that classic fantasy comedy franchise.

3
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,137
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:29,220
Speaker 0: If I sound slightly weird today It's because the novocaine from when I went to the dentist earlier hasn't quite worn off and part of my mouth feels kind of weird.

5
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:32,549
Speaker 1: So who had zero cavities when they went to the dentist?

6
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,985
Speaker 0: actually Scott the thing is my cavity Grim.

7
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,179
Speaker 0: the funny thing is this this cavity.

8
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:48,160
Speaker 0: I basically for the last like six or seven years every dentist I've had has always said I want to keep an eye on this one tooth.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,418
Speaker 0: it looks like it's gonna get a cavity soon, but they kept saying that and it never got a cavity.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,360
Speaker 0: and Finally my latest dentist I went in and he said the same thing and I said you're sure it's not a cavity.

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,705
Speaker 0: He said it's real close.

12
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:01,568
Speaker 0: It's hard to tell.

13
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:03,936
Speaker 0: and I said, you know what just fill it in.

14
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:04,938
Speaker 0: So he filled it in.

15
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:07,940
Speaker 1: You see I've had two different.

16
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:11,634
Speaker 1: I've noticed two different ways that dentist can tell if it's a cavity or not.

17
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,905
Speaker 0: the first he did the x-ray because he couldn't tell From looking at it.

18
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:16,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's the x-ray which is the easiest way.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,160
Speaker 1: You just freakin look which is almost the same as looking at it.

20
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:29,755
Speaker 1: but yeah the the other way is they have this little sonar device that they can use and they hope they put it on your tooth and They push a button and a number shows up on this little LCD screen.

21
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:30,096
Speaker 1: Really?

22
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:31,220
Speaker 0: I've never seen anything like that.

23
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:38,209
Speaker 1: They used it on me once and if it beeps and the number goes over a certain I guess I don't know what the limit is like 70 or 80.

24
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:38,851
Speaker 1: I don't know.

25
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:40,980
Speaker 1: then it's a cavity that needs filling.

26
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:46,985
Speaker 0: I remember when I was a kid the way the dentist seemed to do it was he'd scrape metal over my teeth and anytime it Stuck somewhere.

27
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,199
Speaker 0: He'd examine that area more closely and look for a cavity.

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,734
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but the thing was I had my teeth sealed.

29
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:55,980
Speaker 0: we talked about this in the dentistry episode.

30
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,038
Speaker 0: I got sealants back there.

31
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:02,680
Speaker 0: The cavity is right at the edge of the sealant and it looks like because the sealant so old that it had retracted.

32
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:08,009
Speaker 0: So there was a hole there And there's no way you can brush a hole in your tooth.

33
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:09,693
Speaker 1: I see you have an excuse.

34
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:10,055
Speaker 1: Mr.

35
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:10,596
Speaker 1: Brush.

36
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:11,799
Speaker 1: Yeah brush a lot.

37
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:15,695
Speaker 0: However, however, I don't have an excuse for like the other four cavities.

38
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:16,900
Speaker 0: I got like nine years ago.

39
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, I still have only had two and the first one was when I was 21.

40
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:27,070
Speaker 0: So I've got a grand total of Seven But two of those are technically sealants.

41
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:34,460
Speaker 0: Anyway, I have two other Leading bits that I would like to talk about because today wasn't a very interesting day.

42
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:49,812
Speaker 0: We made BLT's for dinner and they were awesome, but mmm inexplicably Somehow despite the fact that Scott and I probably eat more bread in our household than any other household near us You know, it's the bottom of the food pyramid.

43
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,540
Speaker 1: You're supposed to eat more bread than anything else.

44
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what about Atkins?

45
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,336
Speaker 1: Oh, it's bullshit.

46
00:02:55,356 --> 00:03:08,348
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, so I now make lunches at work because there's a fridge and I wanted to save some money and also because the food near my work is A lot more expensive than the food near IBM used to be.

47
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:11,439
Speaker 0: so I took my loaf of bread from home to work.

48
00:03:12,162 --> 00:03:20,146
Speaker 0: Scott also took his loaf of bread from home to work and when we went to make BLT's we had no Bread no B.

49
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,512
Speaker 1: It was just gonna be an LT.

50
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:22,757
Speaker 0: Well, the B stands for bacon.

51
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,048
Speaker 0: All right You know, you know what?

52
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:31,675
Speaker 0: I'd make plenty of bacon I'd make fun of you But I was about to say the exact same thing and the only reason I didn't say it?

53
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:35,158
Speaker 0: because you said it first and my brain Figured out what was wrong with that statement before?

54
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:42,606
Speaker 1: so so we were gonna make some BB LT's and Well, well a to be BLT.

55
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,250
Speaker 0: So I lost our to be.

56
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:47,820
Speaker 0: I made a bblc instead with some cucumber because we didn't have any tomato.

57
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:52,440
Speaker 1: Either I had one piece of tomato on each because you stole it from the salad.

58
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:52,922
Speaker 0: I made.

59
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:56,259
Speaker 1: that's right and the tomatoes on the plant on the back porch aren't ready yet.

60
00:03:56,782 --> 00:04:00,519
Speaker 0: So I ran to the local key food to get some bread.

61
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:04,811
Speaker 0: now I don't want to rip on mom-and-pop chains or anything.

62
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:07,079
Speaker 1: So key food isn't a mom-and-pop chain.

63
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:10,040
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I didn't realize that until I saw one in New York City.

64
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:11,218
Speaker 0: I didn't know it was a chain.

65
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:19,613
Speaker 0: But people who visited us asked us why we don't go to the local grocery store and why we drive You know 15 minutes away to bigger grocery stores.

66
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:21,360
Speaker 1: key food sucks.

67
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,740
Speaker 0: Every time we've gone there something horrible has happened.

68
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:29,399
Speaker 0: I mean the first time we ever went to this key food.

69
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:34,280
Speaker 0: They didn't have a price on something that I wanted to buy and then they didn't know what to do.

70
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:42,500
Speaker 0: So they were like, well, we can't sell it to you even though you know It was out in a display and it was a thing I needed to barbecue and I was only buying stuff to barbecue.

71
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,040
Speaker 0: So I basically said well if you can't sell me that I don't need any of this stuff.

72
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,956
Speaker 0: And they got really mad and they just they couldn't deal with this situation.

73
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,060
Speaker 0: They could have named a price.

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,965
Speaker 0: I probably just paid it.

75
00:04:52,829 --> 00:05:06,820
Speaker 0: then we went a couple weeks later and Someone in the parking lot rammed a shopping cart into Scott's old car like straight up and they yeah, I remember no They backed up and they jammed a parking shopping cart into the back of your car.

76
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:08,933
Speaker 0: And then we talked about how much we hated the key food.

77
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:12,379
Speaker 1: I Remember that particular incident, but okay, you really don't remember that.

78
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,192
Speaker 0: No, it scratched the hell up out of your bag bumper and everything that remember.

79
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:18,600
Speaker 0: you bitched about it for like a day did?

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,142
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

81
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:19,745
Speaker 0: Yes, you did.

82
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:20,669
Speaker 1: I think you're making it up.

83
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:22,516
Speaker 0: No, I'm really not doesn't matter.

84
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,420
Speaker 1: That was an old shit guy.

85
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,291
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

86
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,967
Speaker 0: it was the old tempo Anyway, and food sucks every time.

87
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,540
Speaker 1: I didn't even have all the different like grocery products that we need.

88
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:35,878
Speaker 0: so today I go there to buy bread and I see oh I'll buy some Kaiser rolls and they're in these bags.

89
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:40,526
Speaker 0: and I look and the bag is buzzing and Look and there's a fly in it.

90
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,358
Speaker 0: and then I look closer and there's a million baby flies in it, too.

91
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:47,659
Speaker 0: And I know there's probably maggots in there as well.

92
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:57,970
Speaker 0: And I I just stared at it in disbelief Went and found some bread that there's no way the key food could have tainted Bought it and I'm never going back to that place.

93
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,098
Speaker 1: No matter what bread from a commercial bakery.

94
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:02,734
Speaker 0: Yes I am never going back to that grocery store.

95
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:06,504
Speaker 1: Good God Uh Key food.

96
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,875
Speaker 1: and in Queens, New York key food is like the grocery store.

97
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,360
Speaker 1: There isn't any other choice.

98
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,844
Speaker 0: Really, I drive past two key foods when I go between my office and Yonkers and one of the hospitals I work at in the Bronx.

99
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:19,133
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like this supermarket, but it's not super.

100
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:22,320
Speaker 0: It's just a regular market Yeah, but it's not good.

101
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:29,347
Speaker 0: Like usually when I think of a market I think of like those small specialty markets that have higher prices But higher quality specialty goods.

102
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:31,798
Speaker 1: No, those are like the ultra small market.

103
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,064
Speaker 1: Yeah That's a small market.

104
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:35,629
Speaker 1: we go to a large market.

105
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:36,492
Speaker 1: this is just a market.

106
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:38,740
Speaker 0: but I got another quick story today.

107
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:39,900
Speaker 0: You know all these balloons.

108
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:53,411
Speaker 0: So as you all know I work in hospitals and today I had to go to a neurological intensive care unit which was one Exactly the way you see these sorts of things in movies.

109
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,340
Speaker 0: It was really kind of cool to be in there though.

110
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:56,084
Speaker 1: Hey weren't there?

111
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:59,220
Speaker 1: isn't that where they put brain-dead people and all sorts of things?

112
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,320
Speaker 0: It was people who had a lot like head injuries and all sorts of stuffs and final injuries.

113
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:07,394
Speaker 0: I felt bad because at one time I wanted to be professional because this is.

114
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:13,548
Speaker 0: I'm sent here to meet with these very well-known Very skilled doctors like this.

115
00:07:13,628 --> 00:07:15,695
Speaker 0: nobody knows like these doctors are.

116
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:24,520
Speaker 0: I guess they're not famous But within the community of the specific things they do they're fairly well known for their research and they're really knowledgeable really smart dudes.

117
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:31,740
Speaker 0: They're also really a lot older than me and Even though I'm a technology Professional like this is my job and I do this sort of thing all the time.

118
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:38,754
Speaker 0: When I walked into this room and I was standing around there's all these Doctors who save lives every day and they all introduce themselves like hi.

119
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:40,320
Speaker 0: I am doctor blah blah blah blah PhD.

120
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:48,484
Speaker 0: Hi, I'm doctor blah blah blah specialist and blah and I'm like, hey, I'm the computer guy And you know what.

121
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:53,760
Speaker 1: you might not know anything about neurological whatnot, but I'm sure they don't know jack about computers.

122
00:07:54,002 --> 00:08:03,880
Speaker 0: no, they don't but you know what I. It's weird, but I don't begrudge them not knowing about computers at all because they know that they're so smart.

123
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,360
Speaker 1: They should just be able to figure out the basics of compute.

124
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,982
Speaker 1: You know, like.

125
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:15,986
Speaker 1: they don't have to be experts like we are but they have to know more than the average person just by their Shear, you know Minimal level of intelligence.

126
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:18,113
Speaker 0: It seems that they from what I gather.

127
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,200
Speaker 0: I don't think they even have time to use computers.

128
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,187
Speaker 1: Wow, the how do they do doctoring?

129
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,440
Speaker 0: because they do the doctoring and other people take care of all the paperwork.

130
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:51,699
Speaker 0: But there they were really smart dudes and it was just weird to be in this in this place Which is a foreign and somewhat frightening sad place full of very injured people Talking to a bunch of extremely highly paid extremely well-educated intelligent men, and I'm just the computer, dude I'm dressed in like a silk black shirt and I got my little locus klein pin and they're all in Business suits with lab coats over them and it was fun

131
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:53,543
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:54,347
Speaker 1: What did they say?

133
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,620
Speaker 0: a bunch of stuff that no one cares about?

134
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:02,635
Speaker 0: I'd have to tell you the details of my job, which is actually not that interesting and probably very tedious.

135
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:03,799
Speaker 1: Did they say anything doctory?

136
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,011
Speaker 0: Actually before they started the thing talking to me.

137
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:17,280
Speaker 0: They were in the middle of a conversation and I Barely unders like now I know how a lot of our friends who aren't so technological as us feel When they're sitting in the room.

138
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:31,074
Speaker 0: well like me and Scott and Alex and James are talking about this stuff because I was standing there politely waiting for them to be finished and I understood all of the individual words they said but combined they meant almost nothing to me.

139
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:31,936
Speaker 0: Haha.

140
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:32,799
Speaker 1: It's another.

141
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:36,798
Speaker 0: it's like Okay, yeah, I'm done with that.

142
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:39,069
Speaker 0: That story doesn't actually go anywhere.

143
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:40,234
Speaker 0: I just thought it was interesting.

144
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:41,640
Speaker 1: You know what I got today.

145
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,480
Speaker 1: I did more work today than I've done any day in the past many months.

146
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:47,734
Speaker 0: You know what going to that meeting was the only work.

147
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:53,272
Speaker 0: I really did today Because all the work I've got to do was canceled or delayed or something.

148
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:53,753
Speaker 0: I got nothing.

149
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,117
Speaker 1: Yeah Wow.

150
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:57,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, just wow All right.

151
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:07,280
Speaker 1: Anyway, you got some anime news, I believe All right, the Fullmetal Alchemist movie which the verdict is sort of out on whether it's actually worth watching or not.

152
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:13,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, we haven't seen it yet So we can't make an opinion, but I have not heard anyone say anything positive about it.

153
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, you think like with some anime movies.

154
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,160
Speaker 1: Everyone's all excited about it.

155
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,166
Speaker 1: You know the heat talking about it and I was.

156
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:28,116
Speaker 1: I was really before the movie came out people were saying ooh a Fullmetal Alchemist movie but it was emphasis on the Fullmetal Alchemist like hooray Fullmetal Alchemist.

157
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:34,294
Speaker 1: we like that a lot and There wasn't so much, you know after the movie came out people going.

158
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:35,558
Speaker 1: Oh, you got to see this movie.

159
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,528
Speaker 1: It's so great It just kind of people stop talking.

160
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:47,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone who saw it basically told us The point is is that Funimation Films is putting it out in movie theaters in the US.

161
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:58,427
Speaker 1: We don't know what theaters but we do know that the show times are Friday August 25th at 930 at night Saturday August 26 at 2 p.m.

162
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:03,840
Speaker 1: And Saturday August 26 at 930 p.m There's gonna be basically three showings.

163
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:06,431
Speaker 1: Hopefully there's a theater near you.

164
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:07,719
Speaker 1: if you want to go see it.

165
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:11,352
Speaker 0: Well, hopefully it'll be in New York City cuz I'll probably head down there and see it.

166
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:13,440
Speaker 1: Maybe it depends how much it is.

167
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:15,324
Speaker 0: It's New York City.

168
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:16,468
Speaker 0: It'll be like 15 bucks.

169
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,311
Speaker 0: Like every movie is.

170
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:18,958
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's worth 15 bucks.

171
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,704
Speaker 1: 15 bucks I could buy the damn DVD.

172
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:22,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it is.

173
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,680
Speaker 0: I mean apple seed was really worth seeing in the theater.

174
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,049
Speaker 0: I mean that was really cool and ghost in the shell innocence was Absolutely worth seeing in the theater.

175
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,000
Speaker 0: That movie was just a spectacle of animation.

176
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:34,347
Speaker 0: I don't know about the FMA movie in terms.

177
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:34,909
Speaker 0: I mean it doesn't.

178
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,700
Speaker 0: it's not like FMA was particularly pretty or well drawn.

179
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,959
Speaker 0: It was actually very generic in the way it was drawn.

180
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:45,238
Speaker 1: Well, the the trailer for the movie makes it look a lot better.

181
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:45,961
Speaker 0: true It does.

182
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:47,768
Speaker 1: the movie was a much higher production value.

183
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:48,451
Speaker 1: Of course.

184
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:58,139
Speaker 0: The new Funimation trailer is kind of like Yeah, like trailers I'd seen before made me more excited and then that trailer made me less excited.

185
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:02,830
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, once we see the movie we'll review it.

186
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,990
Speaker 0: we've had it on our computer for a long time But we never actually watched it.

187
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:15,139
Speaker 0: and then we finally said alright tonight's the night We're going to watch it and then we learned that the subtitle track was broken and then I fixed it But it was then and watched it since then.

188
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:21,837
Speaker 0: Yeah We like we the the spark of let's watch it came and then we failed at watching it and then the spark died and I don't Think it's coming back.

189
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:25,600
Speaker 0: But anyway instead of a second news now you'll all groan.

190
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,036
Speaker 0: I have a geek back and the verdict seems to be that most of you don't like the geek back so much.

191
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:32,411
Speaker 0: or you want him at the end of the Show or something or you want him if it doesn't.

192
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,599
Speaker 0: take away from the news, but one.

193
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,747
Speaker 0: There wasn't so much anime news that we would talk about.

194
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:41,924
Speaker 0: interestingly - there wasn't enough news in the real world that we're ready to talk about.

195
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:42,453
Speaker 0: yet today.

196
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:47,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are some big news is but I think they're gonna wait till tomorrow and next Monday.

197
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:56,519
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz I guess I've gotten to the point where I kind of want to save news that are worthwhile and Especially until everyone out there who listens knows something about it or at least has heard of it.

198
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:02,838
Speaker 0: that way We don't have to spend so much time explaining what the news is and we can spend more time talking about the ramifications And or arguing with each other.

199
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:08,360
Speaker 0: But before I do this geek back, I'd like to say that we may have gotten our first hate mail.

200
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:19,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone did send us something that is kind of like a hate mail But it it's weird because one he accused us of being homosexuals awesome And - he makes some pretty.

201
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:24,863
Speaker 0: I guess I don't want to say valid but definitely Understandable criticisms.

202
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:27,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I replied and started a little conversation.

203
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:32,653
Speaker 1: Just to you know, add some meat to the email and we'll get to it tomorrow.

204
00:13:32,874 --> 00:13:37,824
Speaker 0: Yes, we will but suffice to say It's gonna be fun Mm-hmm.

205
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,920
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's actually a hate mail or not.

206
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:46,324
Speaker 0: I'm still not absolutely sure if he's kidding or what but he did say that it was more of an Irritation mail.

207
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:53,169
Speaker 1: like a hate mail is usually when someone hates you this guy is sort of Irritated with us, but he still is a fan of our show.

208
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,220
Speaker 0: So yeah, well, he didn't actually sign his email either.

209
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, he did what like an uppercase I or a lowercase L.

210
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's his is like screen name or whatever.

211
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:03,447
Speaker 0: That's not a screen name.

212
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:05,054
Speaker 0: one character is not a screen name.

213
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:06,640
Speaker 1: Well, you can see it in his email address.

214
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, but still okay, whatever.

215
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:16,838
Speaker 0: Anyway, this is an old geek back We got a while ago and it's also kind of a news because anime Expo happened and we did weeks

216
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,520
Speaker 1: and weeks ago

217
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:28,600
Speaker 0: and we didn't really talk about it so much and we got a feedback from one of our listeners Colin who was actually there and He gave us pretty much his short rundown of what anime Expo was to him.

218
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, meanwhile comic-con just finished, you know, which is also on the west coast and we haven't talked about that really either.

219
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,340
Speaker 0: So we'll talk about that after Otakon.

220
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,275
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like if a con is on the east coast we cover it the day after.

221
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:43,608
Speaker 1: if a con is on the west coast It gets delayed about like a month or two.

222
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:44,712
Speaker 1: Then we'll talk about it.

223
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:46,418
Speaker 1: those west coast conventions.

224
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:46,900
Speaker 1: They're crazy.

225
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:55,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I'm gonna skip over some of this but I'm really just gonna focus on the anime Expo stuff because we have a lot of opinions about anime Expo and This email is mostly a.

226
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:57,374
Speaker 1: we've never been to anime Expo.

227
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:58,780
Speaker 1: So we can't really yes say them.

228
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,649
Speaker 0: Our opinions are based mostly on hearsay.

229
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,165
Speaker 0: Yep, but this is a Very this is an email.

230
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:05,449
Speaker 0: that's right along our opinions.

231
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:06,814
Speaker 0: Hi Raymond Scott.

232
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:08,660
Speaker 0: I wanted to share my thoughts on anime Expo.

233
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:09,589
Speaker 0: Thanks for the heads up.

234
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,758
Speaker 0: as to the size of the con I've been to many sci-fi and comic-con starting in the late 70s.

235
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,857
Speaker 0: I must say that I concur with your comments as to the type of people who attend anime cons versus other cons.

236
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,940
Speaker 0: I Found the anime folks to be much more open and friendly.

237
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,840
Speaker 0: There are people playing ps2s and gameboys groups of people watching anime on portable DVD players.

238
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:31,120
Speaker 0: Others are playing card games and/or being much more outgoing than the average con goer in my genre.

239
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:34,318
Speaker 0: The people waiting in all the lines were very friendly and outgoing, too.

240
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:39,907
Speaker 0: Thanks Scott for telling me about the updated Japanese version of Gigantor Blah blah blah blah blah.

241
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:40,711
Speaker 0: skip a bit skip a bit.

242
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:49,280
Speaker 0: as for the con itself It was one of the worst run major cons I have ever been to comparable to the stories you told about comic-con in New York.

243
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:55,500
Speaker 0: I got there 30 minutes before opening and the entire parking lot parking area around Anaheim Convention Center was already full.

244
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,540
Speaker 0: They must have had many more people show up than they expected.

245
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:04,160
Speaker 0: They use chairs to mark the rows for ticket lines But they ran out of tape to roll off all the areas.

246
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:06,560
Speaker 0: There were no free goodie bags once you got your tickets.

247
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:07,724
Speaker 0: No program either.

248
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:10,112
Speaker 0: the freebie table wasn't even in a huge weight.

249
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,678
Speaker 1: There was no program.

250
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,668
Speaker 0: apparently He says there was no program either.

251
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:15,920
Speaker 0: They ran out or they didn't give anyone anything.

252
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:22,588
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean it's one thing cuz you know people have been saying that the goodie bags have been drying up But for no program.

253
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:23,050
Speaker 1: whoa?

254
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:32,320
Speaker 0: also the fact that it's anime Expo I mean kinetic on had a lot of really valid reasons for the anime Expo is supposedly the anime con of this hemisphere.

255
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:33,440
Speaker 0: Well, it's also well.

256
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:34,959
Speaker 0: I would say Otakon is but yeah.

257
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,975
Speaker 1: But well the thing is that anime expos more of a trade show and Otakon is more of a.

258
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:41,566
Speaker 0: but anime Expo has such Support from the industry.

259
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:44,257
Speaker 0: I can't believe that the industry would chaff them on that.

260
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,611
Speaker 0: yeah I mean can I got had good reasons.

261
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:47,920
Speaker 0: anime Expo is no excuse.

262
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:51,311
Speaker 1: Anime Expo is sort of like the e3 and Otakon is sort of like the packs.

263
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:52,315
Speaker 0: Yeah.

264
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:53,298
Speaker 0: I love packs.

265
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:53,820
Speaker 0: I want to go.

266
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:55,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, we love it.

267
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,927
Speaker 0: We haven't been to it right to keep going on this.

268
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:00,788
Speaker 0: the freebie table wasn't even in the huge hall where people checked in Out or bought their tickets.

269
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:03,206
Speaker 0: it was off in the corner somewhere And you actively had to search it out.

270
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,260
Speaker 0: the ACC is multiple stories high.

271
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:10,613
Speaker 0: Signs for the various events only said things like second floor third floor etc.

272
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:11,234
Speaker 1: They didn't.

273
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:12,680
Speaker 1: they didn't say what room quote.

274
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,065
Speaker 0: They didn't tell you the room number.

275
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:15,589
Speaker 0: you are you sure?

276
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:18,540
Speaker 0: you had to ask a staff member and some of them didn't know.

277
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:20,919
Speaker 0: There were other examples too, but you get the idea.

278
00:17:21,902 --> 00:17:24,997
Speaker 0: He also made a whole bunch of copies of our flyer and spread them around.

279
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:26,804
Speaker 0: Thanks for that He.

280
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:31,620
Speaker 0: Everything else he says is just telling us cool stuff about us or other stuff that isn't related to the con.

281
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:36,378
Speaker 0: He was happy that we pronounce his name correctly, which mostly is because we had a friend named Colin.

282
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,010
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, I know how to pronounce the name Colin.

283
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:39,895
Speaker 1: It's not howdy.

284
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:40,920
Speaker 1: How are you gonna pronounce it?

285
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,188
Speaker 0: He says here people pronounced it Colleen or Colin.

286
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:58,154
Speaker 1: Well, it could be Colin, but that's Colin Powell and and if it's Colin, it's a female and Colleen's usually Co le en Co le en.

287
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,419
Speaker 1: that could be a good one, too.

288
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:01,766
Speaker 1: See, that's another thing.

289
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:02,932
Speaker 1: I just remembered about Otacon.

290
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:04,239
Speaker 1: is they had that information desk?

291
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:07,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the people there always know what's going on.

292
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,328
Speaker 1: They know everything at the information desk and I've used it at least once every year for some random thing Like even if it's just oh I shit.

293
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:17,120
Speaker 1: I forgot what room I'll just happen to be near the information desk.

294
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,948
Speaker 1: so I'll say hey what room is X in?

295
00:18:18,988 --> 00:18:26,638
Speaker 1: and they'll be like room number number number number and It's a lot of conventions don't have an information desk like that, you know, right?

296
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:31,078
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean, I'd like to go to anime Expo maybe once to confirm.

297
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:39,180
Speaker 0: but If any of you have been to anime Expo and had a positive experience Please let us know because I have never really heard good things about this convention at all.

298
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:44,216
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like the good things you hear about the convention are always in the press releases.

299
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:50,820
Speaker 1: or yeah You never hear good stuff like people's you know excited about anime Expo that are fans.

300
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,300
Speaker 1: Like if you go to a fan forum, there isn't a lot of anime Expo excitement.

301
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:59,698
Speaker 0: In fact, the best I've seen is I've seen some people who would say they had a good time at it mostly in anime Expo forums.

302
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,893
Speaker 0: But mostly these are people who had never never been to Otacon and vice versa.

303
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:06,260
Speaker 1: So it's like we've never been to anime.

304
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:07,340
Speaker 0: So yes far away.

305
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,900
Speaker 0: It's possible that we just really underestimate that con and they just really underestimate our cons, but I don't know.

306
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:15,467
Speaker 1: It's a tough girl.

307
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:18,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if everything he said in this email is true.

308
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:26,420
Speaker 0: That's really kind of sad because I mean I expect even small conventions to be better than that and they almost all are.

309
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:31,154
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Kinetic on even told you what rooms and they had a program.

310
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:35,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean a program That's not perfect is better than no program.

311
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:37,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just wondered did they run out of programs?

312
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,648
Speaker 0: Which means they didn't come make enough?

313
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:42,480
Speaker 0: or did they not have one which means they're having other problems?

314
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,110
Speaker 0: Or did they have them and screw up distributing them?

315
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,455
Speaker 0: So people who wanted them didn't get them.

316
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:49,805
Speaker 1: I have no idea But it's not good.

317
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:53,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if anyone has anything positive to say about anime Expo, please let us know.

318
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, and maybe we'll go to it sometime.

319
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:59,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe you can use that audio link on the website to send us some audio.

320
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:09,417
Speaker 1: Oh, I got an owl of the day.

321
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:10,419
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

322
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,617
Speaker 0: Yeah Did you say that specifically to bait me into saying?

323
00:20:13,657 --> 00:20:13,979
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

324
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:17,777
Speaker 0: Maybe I see what you did there.

325
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,051
Speaker 1: So This is a. It seems like a Japanese TV show.

326
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:26,438
Speaker 1: Of course, it could be Korean.

327
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:26,820
Speaker 1: Who knows?

328
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,422
Speaker 0: You know what?

329
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:30,240
Speaker 0: I generally assume that anything like that is a Japanese TV show.

330
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,754
Speaker 1: It's got to be and there's an owl and he's sitting on a log and he's all like yeah.

331
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:35,376
Speaker 1: I'm an owl.

332
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:36,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

333
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:37,911
Speaker 1: what you gonna do about it?

334
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:47,234
Speaker 1: and this guy comes up with a little jack-in-the-box and the jack-in-the-box goes off and Then hilarity ensues and I'll leave it at that.

335
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:48,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, watch this owl.

336
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:56,391
Speaker 0: I just I love watching birds react to things because they're smart and they react in Almost human-like ways in the way they look at.

337
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:58,640
Speaker 1: most birds are just kind of it but owls.

338
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,524
Speaker 1: Well, yeah something else.

339
00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:01,030
Speaker 0: owls and parrots and smart bird.

340
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:03,140
Speaker 0: I mean, there are dumb birds starlings not so bright.

341
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:05,898
Speaker 1: It's all about the owls, baby.

342
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:07,863
Speaker 1: Yeah, really?

343
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:08,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, really?

344
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:09,307
Speaker 0: Okay.

345
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:21,108
Speaker 0: All right now I this is something I found kind of randomly because I was actually looking for video of my old marching band because a couple of people had asked me about it and Actually all my friends in the van.

346
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:23,760
Speaker 0: I've been asked him around and no one has the videos anymore.

347
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:25,958
Speaker 0: So I'm trying to hunt down like some videos.

348
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:41,538
Speaker 0: But anyway, and I found this kind of randomly and it's basically a guy who plays a trumpet duet but it's just one guy and He does the old trick of hold two trumpets one in each hand on two parts of your lips and play a song on both Trumpets playing different notes on both of them.

349
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:46,694
Speaker 0: It's not that difficult to do but it's really difficult to do so.

350
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:51,049
Speaker 0: it sounds like anything other than crap And it's just really cool.

351
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:51,432
Speaker 0: Check it out.

352
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:55,174
Speaker 1: Oh You know, it's like those guys who play two guitars.

353
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:56,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like stuff like that.

354
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,699
Speaker 0: I really like watching people do cool things with instruments.

355
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:06,619
Speaker 1: you know, it really always bothers me like You know, how long has it been since someone's invented a new instrument, you know?

356
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:14,619
Speaker 0: Well, keep in mind that the vast majority of instruments that have been invented over the years have been ignored for good reason That that is absolutely true.

357
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:22,560
Speaker 1: But you know, you can't tell me or convince me that there isn't a useful instrument that hasn't yet been created.

358
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:29,506
Speaker 0: Yeah, well there I mean over the years have been a lot of things like trombones and trumpets and French horns have evolved considerably and Gotten better and better and better.

359
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:42,234
Speaker 0: Of course new instruments has appeared like the sousaphone Was a new instrument that Basically how new a Long time ago centuries John Philip Sousa days.

360
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:44,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, hence sousaphone.

361
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:47,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, so so it's not a new instrument.

362
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,232
Speaker 0: It's new.

363
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:49,597
Speaker 1: I think the newest instrument.

364
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:54,900
Speaker 1: That's Theremin is the theremin or perhaps the electronic keyboard the synthesizer.

365
00:22:55,841 --> 00:23:08,159
Speaker 1: See, oh, you know, there's new synthesizers every day true Maybe that's why there's no new Instruments because people just make a new synthesizer to sound make a new sound if they come up with one and That we don't need an actual instrument for it anymore.

366
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:11,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's already a million kinds of trumpets.

367
00:23:11,512 --> 00:23:13,340
Speaker 0: I can't think of a different kind of trumpet.

368
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,125
Speaker 1: I would want to know a different mechanism like not a woodwind instrument not a brass instrument a new kind of instrument that works on A different principle.

369
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:27,006
Speaker 0: All right, so other than something vibrating at the end of a tube Yeah, okay How about hitting something?

370
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:27,850
Speaker 0: we got that covered?

371
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,051
Speaker 1: We've got the hitting we've got the string plucking We've got the the blowing into something.

372
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:35,379
Speaker 1: We need a. we need a fourth way to make music.

373
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,669
Speaker 0: Hmm, maybe we should read the fourth way.

374
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,635
Speaker 1: No because I'm gonna do with music.

375
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:41,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the moon might know.

376
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:44,922
Speaker 1: No, it's just gonna eat your soul Alright.

377
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:46,329
Speaker 0: now to the geek back.

378
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:48,780
Speaker 0: We got a while ago complaining about inside jokes.

379
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,427
Speaker 0: That was a fucking inside joke right there.

380
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:52,269
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

381
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:53,191
Speaker 1: Was that inside?

382
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, uh, I'll leave it at that.

383
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:58,885
Speaker 0: today We're going to talk about Slayers.

384
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:00,291
Speaker 0: it kind of in general.

385
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:10,980
Speaker 1: we're not Slayer as in the band Not Slayer as in I'm going to slay you or don't forget people who ride sleighs.

386
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:16,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know arrow of slaying versus arrow of slaying right.

387
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:22,455
Speaker 1: so The Slayers that we're talking about are these slayers as in the anime mostly.

388
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:24,560
Speaker 1: the anime mostly but also the manga.

389
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:30,339
Speaker 0: We're not reviewing it so much because I've only seen the first layers and most of slayers.

390
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:36,479
Speaker 0: next God has only seen the first layers and a bunch of the OAVs and neither of us have read the manga at all.

391
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:38,989
Speaker 0: I bought a bunch of it, but I haven't even looked at it yet.

392
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:41,660
Speaker 1: I haven't read a single slayers manga.

393
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,155
Speaker 1: now Let's let's first talk about What slayers things exist.

394
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:46,720
Speaker 1: there are?

395
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,540
Speaker 1: two mangas, yep, there are.

396
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:52,416
Speaker 1: There is a prequel movie.

397
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:54,380
Speaker 1: there is another as a prequel OAV.

398
00:24:55,224 --> 00:24:58,140
Speaker 1: There are one two three four sequel movies.

399
00:24:58,802 --> 00:25:11,039
Speaker 1: There's the original slayers TV show 26 episodes is slayers next which is the second TV show also 26 and there is a third slayers TV show slayers try which is 24 episodes and then some crap.

400
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:13,612
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.

401
00:25:13,653 --> 00:25:13,814
Speaker 1: Yep.

402
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:13,996
Speaker 1: Yep.

403
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:19,738
Speaker 1: So slayers is about mostly this one girl Lena inverse.

404
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,400
Speaker 0: now She is a magic user.

405
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,271
Speaker 0: She is a high-level magic user in a world that is basically Dungeons & Dragons Made real this.

406
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:29,740
Speaker 1: this is exactly Dungeons & Dragons.

407
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,254
Speaker 1: I mean imagine who made slayers were D&D players and this was like one of their campaigns.

408
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:36,200
Speaker 0: like imagine a world where you're the world.

409
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:43,932
Speaker 0: it's just like D&D and people can just cast fireball and High level people just kick the living hell out of anyone who's lower level.

410
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's big baddies and you fight them.

411
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:49,820
Speaker 1: Now there are two types of slayers shows and manga.

412
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:56,059
Speaker 1: They're the Lena inverse with Naga the serpent and there is Lena inverse with everyone else.

413
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,591
Speaker 0: now I greatly prefer the latter of the two.

414
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:00,380
Speaker 1: I greatly prefer the former.

415
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, see they're both good shows and they're both good.

416
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:05,140
Speaker 0: They're just there's a very different feeling.

417
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,571
Speaker 0: I mean the theoretically slayers with Naga Occurs way before she meets up with all these other people.

418
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:19,720
Speaker 1: Yes slayers with Naga is what you're gonna see in All the prequel movies and and like the OAVs most all that stuff.

419
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,433
Speaker 1: Yep, the actual TV shows you're not gonna see Naga the serpent.

420
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:25,400
Speaker 0: She's not there which is fine by me.

421
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:28,633
Speaker 1: Okay, so Naga the serpent let's talk about her first cuz it's simple to explain.

422
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,320
Speaker 1: All right now get the surface.

423
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:33,551
Speaker 1: That's Naga the serpent.

424
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:40,460
Speaker 1: she is Incredibly tall has gigantic boobs and black hair and she's a powerful sorceress.

425
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,822
Speaker 1: Yeah And see here's there's Lena inverse is short has small boobs and is an even more powerful Sorcer seems.

426
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:54,766
Speaker 0: the general differences between the Naga slayers and the everyone else layers is that the former tends to rely mostly on Boob jokes.

427
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,579
Speaker 0: My boobs are small OMG.

428
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:01,480
Speaker 0: And then they blow stuff up and make puns.

429
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,156
Speaker 0: Yep, the latter is more.

430
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:06,099
Speaker 0: We're hungry.

431
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:07,806
Speaker 0: Chaos ensues.

432
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:10,013
Speaker 1: we go to an inn we eat.

433
00:27:10,134 --> 00:27:11,960
Speaker 1: the inn is blown up by a dragon.

434
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:13,570
Speaker 1: We go to another in to eat.

435
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,080
Speaker 1: It is blown up by a dragon.

436
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:18,318
Speaker 1: They cannot eat at an inn without it being blown up.

437
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:23,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, if you haven't figured it out, these shows are nothing but comedy.

438
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:31,640
Speaker 1: Slayers is perhaps the perennial Fantasy D&D adventuring comedy series of all anime and manga.

439
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:39,849
Speaker 0: I mean lotus war is looked to by many as the earliest really good fantasy Like high production value anime of the modern era.

440
00:27:39,969 --> 00:27:42,658
Speaker 1: Yes slayers is hilarious lotus war.

441
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:44,023
Speaker 0: Yes It's fine.

442
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:47,517
Speaker 0: I find it funnier than lotus island and I really like lotus island.

443
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:49,985
Speaker 1: Oh, man Slayers just you know.

444
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:52,052
Speaker 1: lotus island is made to be cute.

445
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,600
Speaker 1: lotus war but slayers the whole thing.

446
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,490
Speaker 1: He's just meant to be as funny as possible.

447
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:58,500
Speaker 1: Even at the incredibly serious parts.

448
00:27:58,669 --> 00:27:58,839
Speaker 0: Yes

449
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,706
Speaker 1: they make jokes that are just stupid like

450
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:10,094
Speaker 0: it gets to the point where the show like starts getting serious and then something stupid happens and They break the fourth wall all the time and they'll turn to you and be like, yeah There's no way they let the show get that serious.

451
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:18,036
Speaker 1: Haha Yeah, it'll be like they'll fighting the the super serious bad guy and this is a super serious awesome fight.

452
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:22,231
Speaker 1: music and you know They're gonna save the world or a bunch of people are gonna die.

453
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,420
Speaker 1: and then some guy would be like, yeah, whatever.

454
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:29,134
Speaker 0: Now the best part about slayers that they kind of mean every.

455
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:39,179
Speaker 0: a lot of things in slayers are very cliche but a lot of the cliches and slayers were not so cliched when they were done and they've become cliches more so since.

456
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:56,312
Speaker 0: and also there's one moment in the original season of slayers that to me just defines part of the awesome of the show where There's the big bad guy and he's about to do his big bad thing and the hero show up to stop him and he's like You cannot stop me and he sends a monster for them to fight.

457
00:28:56,352 --> 00:29:08,299
Speaker 0: now in any typical fantasy Whatever the bad guy would stand there watching While the you know, the good guys fought his giant monster and then when they beat the giant monster There'd be some sort of epic final conflict.

458
00:29:09,343 --> 00:29:16,836
Speaker 0: The bad guy as soon as he sticks the monster Immediately runs away locks the door does his evil ritual and completes it as fast as he can.

459
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,912
Speaker 0: Yep The show is just awesome.

460
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,120
Speaker 1: It's very awesome.

461
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,849
Speaker 1: There are a lot of other things that make it awesome.

462
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:30,120
Speaker 1: like rim is talking about some of the cliches You know how many animes have you seen where the cat the main care group of characters is always hungry and they you know?

463
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,100
Speaker 1: Once in a while they get money and food like samurai Champloo and kawaii boppin.

464
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, all those slayers I think is the first show to have that I'm sure anime world order is gonna send us.

465
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:42,331
Speaker 0: Oh you forgot about Poland.

466
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:44,999
Speaker 1: Oh, we sure did damn Poland.

467
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:53,180
Speaker 0: Uh Yeah, I mean once again, we're not reviewing slayers because I think we're gonna review each season and each bit of slayers independent.

468
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,888
Speaker 1: Yeah this is an introduction to the world of slayers.

469
00:29:55,968 --> 00:30:07,279
Speaker 1: for those of you who don't know of it cuz slayers is a really old show that was super popular and they licensed the hell out of it and they distributed all over the US and then After they sold it to everyone.

470
00:30:07,782 --> 00:30:14,324
Speaker 1: It's been kind of forgotten in favor of newer shows and I think even some of the licenses lapsed and were Re-picked up and

471
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:26,440
Speaker 0: I mean it used to be back in the day when you went to a Suncoast or somewhere that actually sold Anime, they would have VHS's of Ranma and then a VHS's of slayers like those two were always there everywhere.

472
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:32,540
Speaker 1: And nowadays a lot of new fans don't even know slayers or they know of it, but they've never seen it.

473
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:48,719
Speaker 0: Yeah and honestly I I have to admit that I hadn't seen that much of the first season of slayers and it wasn't until Scott and I actually Watched it all the way through That it was actually weird to see the characters before they met each other because I'd seen so much of slayers where they're all already together.

474
00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:50,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was deaf.

475
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:51,980
Speaker 1: It's always weird to watch.

476
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,385
Speaker 1: You know what happened before.

477
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:59,900
Speaker 1: if you if you already know what happened after Star Wars Oh God Yeah, let's talk about this one.

478
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,615
Speaker 1: If you're gonna watch any slayers the movie the movie is what you have to write now.

479
00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:13,180
Speaker 0: when we say the slayers movie We mean the one that you'll see in the anime store on DVD the one that is right there everywhere It is everyone knows it as the slayers movie.

480
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:17,874
Speaker 1: It says on the DVD case slayers the motion picture now.

481
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:23,929
Speaker 0: It is a Lina and Naga and This is where many of our inside jokes come from.

482
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,692
Speaker 0: surprisingly.

483
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:28,145
Speaker 1: There is the main joke in this the bit.

484
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:38,447
Speaker 1: the plot of the movie is that this is island Mipros Island and Lena inverse is on this island and there's something bad going on there and She has to figure it out and stop it.

485
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:40,235
Speaker 1: and she's a super powerful sorceress.

486
00:31:40,255 --> 00:31:41,119
Speaker 1: So that's not a problem.

487
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,953
Speaker 1: Yeah It's mostly the figuring it out.

488
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:46,294
Speaker 0: That's the problem Yeah, plus she doesn't really care until they bribe her with a lot of money.

489
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:47,460
Speaker 1: exactly, you know.

490
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:55,667
Speaker 0: But keep in mind that this movie is a lot different from the slayers TV shows and that it's very surreal and weird Very at least at some parts of it.

491
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:59,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but overall I mean compared to the TV show which is very straightforward.

492
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:08,629
Speaker 1: So early on in the movie some guy shows up and he's like he's fighting he's gonna fight with Lena and he says I'm the Fifth strongest man on Mipros Island now ha ha ha ha ha.

493
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,300
Speaker 0: I highly recommend you watch the dub because it's pretty well done.

494
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:15,980
Speaker 0: And I got to admit hearing someone yell in English, huh?

495
00:32:16,263 --> 00:32:17,860
Speaker 0: I am the fifth strongest man on Mipros Island.

496
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:19,728
Speaker 0: Just I can't.

497
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:21,214
Speaker 0: I can't help but laugh at that.

498
00:32:21,335 --> 00:32:27,600
Speaker 1: and then a little while later She runs into the fourth strongest man on Mipros Island and well, you can see where it goes from there.

499
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:34,540
Speaker 1: But when we talk about being the ex strongest something in something we're making fun of the first slayers.

500
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:36,128
Speaker 1: Well the slayers movie.

501
00:32:36,268 --> 00:32:36,510
Speaker 0: Yes.

502
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:42,033
Speaker 0: Now if you've never seen any slayers If nothing else pick up this movie because it is very funny.

503
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:48,640
Speaker 0: It'll introduce you to the world It'll introduce you to all the kinds of jokes and you don't have to invest in an entire TV show.

504
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,626
Speaker 1: Yeah This is a completely self-contained movie.

505
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:55,001
Speaker 1: someone who knows jack and shit about slayers will laugh their ass off at this thing if you like It.

506
00:32:55,161 --> 00:33:03,618
Speaker 0: either Netflix or buy the first season of slayers because it's really easy to come by nowadays Mm-hmm, and it should be even easier to come by as time goes on.

507
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:08,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one's printing more of it But no one's buying it and the price is just gonna drop.

508
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:12,822
Speaker 0: now the TV show as opposed to the movies and OAVs and such the.

509
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:16,699
Speaker 0: I mean it gets very serious at times, but it always fades back to funny.

510
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:22,518
Speaker 0: and Then slayers next which is the sequel to slayers and it takes place pretty much right after.

511
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:23,100
Speaker 0: it just keeps going.

512
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:25,399
Speaker 0: It kind of widens the gap.

513
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,286
Speaker 0: There's more serious but even more funny.

514
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:39,835
Speaker 0: and then slayers try which I actually didn't like so much and I didn't even see all of it Takes it to the extreme and it has the crazy Stupid funny and the crazy serious and it the dichotomy almost gets too big.

515
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:41,560
Speaker 0: but luckily the show didn't progress beyond that.

516
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:47,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, another warning for anyone who's gonna watch slayers is that there's a lot of running gags and repetitive humor.

517
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:53,760
Speaker 1: You'll see the same you'll see a joke and then they'll keep going with that same joke and never change it ever.

518
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:55,688
Speaker 0: Though the thing is it's usually still funny.

519
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:58,720
Speaker 1: to me it is it's still a little bit funny every time.

520
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:04,913
Speaker 1: but if you're the kind of person who groans and moans when they've you know, Some character has a shtick like.

521
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:05,980
Speaker 1: what's a good example?

522
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,190
Speaker 0: Amelia falls on her face when she tries to jump into the heat of battle.

523
00:34:09,451 --> 00:34:17,460
Speaker 1: exactly Amelia whenever she's about to enter a fight She climbs up somewhere very high and then she jumps into the fight and then she lands on her face every single goddamn time.

524
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,726
Speaker 1: So it's funny as hell.

525
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:21,734
Speaker 1: the first three times is you realize?

526
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:23,420
Speaker 1: aha she falls in her face all the time.

527
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,819
Speaker 1: But then in in future episodes, she just keeps falling on her face.

528
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:32,260
Speaker 0: Now the thing is that type of humor seems to be a mainstay of a lot of the early anime comedies.

529
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:40,235
Speaker 0: So if you can't deal with it in slayers You really shouldn't watch any of the early anime comedy shows because they're all like that.

530
00:34:40,697 --> 00:34:44,049
Speaker 1: Yeah So many jokes like that in slayers.

531
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:48,364
Speaker 1: I mean every time they're eating food in and in it explodes Or sets on fire.

532
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:51,359
Speaker 0: Who knows what the hell things get blown up all the time.

533
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's also a lot.

534
00:34:53,608 --> 00:35:01,993
Speaker 0: if you play Dungeons & Dragons or any kind of fantasy role-playing You will appreciate these shows on such a higher level than if you don't.

535
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:04,680
Speaker 0: I mean Lena needs money at one point.

536
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:07,940
Speaker 0: So she sits there like basically making magic items to sell in town.

537
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:21,052
Speaker 1: Yeah They actually animate that whole scene where like she gets some equipment and she goes out to like some shrine and she starts casting Metamorphosis spells to turn some dreck into some gems and then she sells them at a store in town.

538
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:24,708
Speaker 0: or she gets some magic items and they start selling them You know like to take magic.

539
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,860
Speaker 0: Ooh, this one's worth this much and tries to sell it to people.

540
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,700
Speaker 1: It's yeah, isn't there some episode later on where they go somewhere where there's no magic and they're ridiculously powerful.

541
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:34,925
Speaker 0: Yes in slayers try see it.

542
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:36,590
Speaker 0: They're ridiculously powerful.

543
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,740
Speaker 1: Anyway, these are slayers is a story about high-level characters.

544
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:46,500
Speaker 1: They're stupid powerful like saving the world from the most powerful demon god powerful.

545
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:47,363
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are.

546
00:35:47,484 --> 00:35:51,740
Speaker 0: I mean D&D terms their 9th to 12th level even more than that.

547
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,451
Speaker 0: Well Lena probably more but everyone else seems to be there.

548
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:55,154
Speaker 0: They're high level.

549
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,580
Speaker 0: They're definitely not epic level yet.

550
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:02,220
Speaker 1: No, they're not gods, but they can stave off gods through the use of incredibly powerful artifacts.

551
00:36:02,387 --> 00:36:08,232
Speaker 0: Yes kill a couple of gods even yeah, but it Actually slayers try had something really good going for it.

552
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:14,294
Speaker 0: that part of the plot there is that They end up in a world where there is no magic like people don't like.

553
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:23,720
Speaker 0: magic is this crazy rare thing and I don't really want to ruin much but there's not much to ruin in slayers really and They still have all their powers because they know how to cast spells.

554
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:38,547
Speaker 0: So like there's a part where one of the characters at like goat like has one of the townspeople lead him to like this ancient ruin of the ancient masters like this Secret Forbidden Palace that has been sealed by something and hasn't been open for thousands of years And he's like is this a place?

555
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,797
Speaker 0: the guys like yes, and he just kicks the gate open walks in.

556
00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:43,557
Speaker 0: he's like oh All right, he grabs some artifacts like this is pretty weak.

557
00:36:44,562 --> 00:36:50,874
Speaker 0: Another character flies up on the top of building to look around and all the townsfolk think that she's gonna jump to her death And just funny stuff like that.

558
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:53,643
Speaker 0: Of course.

559
00:36:53,703 --> 00:37:01,644
Speaker 0: layers next has probably my favorite joke in all of slayers the the whole thing with trying to find the Claire Bible the Claire bevel the Claire bevel I don't even know.

560
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:03,232
Speaker 0: I've never actually seen the sub of slayer.

561
00:37:03,272 --> 00:37:04,699
Speaker 1: One of my favorite jokes is the fish men.

562
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:07,049
Speaker 1: There there are these.

563
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,340
Speaker 1: this is race of creatures.

564
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:19,240
Speaker 1: There are a lot of different races of creatures as in any Fantasy universe and one of the races of creatures in slayers are the fish men and they're basically fish with cartoon arms and legs.

565
00:37:19,902 --> 00:37:23,937
Speaker 0: They're ugly as hell and you get the sense that they smell bad and they're all evil.

566
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:27,691
Speaker 0: yet They're all silly also kind of stupid.

567
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:33,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're stupid evil and silly And they show up when you at least expect them.

568
00:37:33,074 --> 00:37:34,240
Speaker 0: It's like like altros.

569
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:36,851
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you're walking around and there's a fish man.

570
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:37,514
Speaker 1: What the hell?

571
00:37:37,534 --> 00:37:41,270
Speaker 0: Oh my god Remember the fish man that was flying around like a bullet.

572
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:42,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

573
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:43,520
Speaker 1: What was his problem?

574
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,653
Speaker 0: I think the funniest part of that was you said why don't they just do this?

575
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:49,718
Speaker 0: and then they just did that and it killed the fish man immediately.

576
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:53,047
Speaker 0: That's one nice thing about the show.

577
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:58,940
Speaker 0: the characters always seem to act intelligently Like they were being played by real people in a D&D game.

578
00:37:59,441 --> 00:38:02,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, but sometimes they also act stupidly, you know, like.

579
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:10,760
Speaker 1: well stupid characters do like they get lost and then they can't find each other Again, you know it they'll get into trouble and then they won't be able to get out.

580
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,459
Speaker 1: But as long as they stick together, they can just keep acting smartly and do the right thing.

581
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:24,059
Speaker 1: There are other sort of annoying things like I think for a stretch of episodes in the original slayers It just every episode seemed like it was the same thing.

582
00:38:24,423 --> 00:38:32,896
Speaker 1: They would be in a different place But they would fight the same bad guys and then those bad guys would run away and the next episode they'd be in a different Place and then to fight those same bad guys again.

583
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:36,398
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, the thing is I really enjoy like I just like it.

584
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:40,920
Speaker 0: slayers The original series has a really good nice place in my heart and I really enjoy it.

585
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,720
Speaker 0: It's one of my favorite old shows, but I enjoyed slayers next a lot more.

586
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,420
Speaker 0: So I think Scott when you see slayers next you your love of slayers will come to a whole new level.

587
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:50,456
Speaker 1: I don't know.

588
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:58,489
Speaker 1: I'm still more a fan of the naga the serpent because that stuff is just all-out Hilarity and doesn't doesn't even bother with the serious.

589
00:38:58,509 --> 00:38:59,933
Speaker 1: then hilarity then serious.

590
00:38:59,993 --> 00:39:05,179
Speaker 0: It's just all funny jellyfish in the sea cucumbers Exactly or the giant golems.

591
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:10,220
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah if you want to see really silly stuff get all the slayers.

592
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah God yeah slayers must be good because we just keep laughing as we remember scenes from it.

593
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:28,107
Speaker 1: yeah, so anyone out there who doesn't know of slayers or Maybe you know of it and you've never seen it.

594
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,760
Speaker 1: It is an anime that all should see an experience.

595
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,529
Speaker 0: I mean, it's definitely not.

596
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,137
Speaker 0: I don't think in my top 5 or top 10 No, no, no.

597
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,049
Speaker 0: But it is definitely on the list of.

598
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:44,320
Speaker 0: if you consider yourself an anime fan But not like as in you would define yourself as a fan or anime is your thing.

599
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:46,949
Speaker 0: You really have no excuse to have not seen slayers.

600
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:47,090
Speaker 0: you.

601
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,652
Speaker 0: that is like.

602
00:39:47,732 --> 00:40:00,411
Speaker 0: I must see anime because so much comes from slayers that is in modern anime and it was such a good show when it came out and the fact that It's still a pretty good show all things considered even today.

603
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:03,180
Speaker 0: It would even stand up to a lot of modern shows.

604
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:12,580
Speaker 1: And the thing is even though some slayers OAVs and movies are better than others They're all at least at the bare minimum funny.

605
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:17,159
Speaker 1: You will laugh it no matter which one you watch and if you don't laugh, you're not gonna laugh any of them.

606
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you don't laugh at them, there's a lot of anime you're not gonna like.

607
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,660
Speaker 1: There are also some slayers video games.

608
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,040
Speaker 1: I know there's an SNES game, but they're all Japanese and I don't think they've been translated.

609
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:29,310
Speaker 0: Yes, any s game has been but not officially there have been.

610
00:40:29,331 --> 00:40:30,434
Speaker 1: it's not a fun game.

611
00:40:30,534 --> 00:40:32,361
Speaker 0: Anyway, well, it's like Final Fantasy 6.

612
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:38,474
Speaker 0: It's a lot like Final Fantasy 6 in fact And I played through a little bit of it and then the translated ROM I was using.

613
00:40:38,534 --> 00:40:43,879
Speaker 0: it turns out that whatever fucker Translated it translated the first bit and then just stopped.

614
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:51,506
Speaker 0: So fine one day I get to a village like I get somewhere and I talk to someone and it's just gibberish and not even Japanese characters are just gibberish.

615
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:56,781
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then everyone I talked to was gibberish and I couldn't forget through the game anymore Uh-huh.

616
00:40:57,484 --> 00:41:00,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't really recommend it as a game.

617
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:09,739
Speaker 0: You should play unless you're Japanese though I can't verify this cuz I didn't play through the game and I'm not gonna look it up or anything, but I heard There's some slayers trivia for you that you know.

618
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,577
Speaker 0: Naga and Lena adventure and then later Naga and Gauri and everyone else adventure and there's really no overlap at all.

619
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:26,475
Speaker 0: Like there's no Continuity directly between the two and Apparently in the video game Gauri and Naga meet one another.

620
00:41:26,495 --> 00:41:27,659
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

621
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,720
Speaker 0: now That is nothing but hearsay.

622
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:38,380
Speaker 0: I will not back that statement up at all But more than one person has told me this and I've never bothered to look it up.

623
00:41:39,781 --> 00:41:41,988
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I said before, you know some slayers.

624
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:52,960
Speaker 1: things are Lena inverse and Naga the serpent and no one else except for the bad Guys, of course and the rest of slayers is Lena inverse and an entire party of adventurers, but not Naga the serpent.

625
00:41:53,683 --> 00:42:03,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd go through all the characters because I could say a lot about him, but even describing it now He's a fighter there's well, it's saying the names of certain characters ruins things that oh that guy's not a villain.

626
00:42:04,642 --> 00:42:05,084
Speaker 1: It's true.

627
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:15,020
Speaker 0: cuz I'm assuming that people who are gonna go out and watch the show because of us They haven't seen it and they won't know that that one guy is actually a really cool main character or that that other guy dies.

628
00:42:15,624 --> 00:42:22,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's generally there's a fighter There's a guy who's a magician, but he's a different kind of magician like a druid type.

629
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:29,946
Speaker 0: Yeah They there's a lot of clarity in the magic like there's a rogue type of person kind is Dungeons & Dragons style magic.

630
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:33,860
Speaker 0: you say the spell it happens and the fireball.

631
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:44,326
Speaker 0: The spells follow the same kinds of rules that D&D spells would and in fact the characters explain this stuff all the time Like they explain it to each other.

632
00:42:44,346 --> 00:42:47,720
Speaker 0: they'll explain what spells do just this for the benefit of the Watchers.

633
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:51,595
Speaker 1: They'll lose their spell powers during that time of the month.

634
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:59,016
Speaker 0: Yes, which It's a really freakin good show, I don't know how many times I need to say that.

635
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,908
Speaker 1: all right I think that covers it.

636
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:12,446
Speaker 0: Yeah under the few meta bits Don't forget that next week is the last week before we go to Otacon and the week after that We can't promise that there will be Episodes.

637
00:43:12,748 --> 00:43:25,439
Speaker 0: Yes, most likely the week after Otacon they're going to be some short like five to ten minute geek night specials that we're going to record ahead of time and Set up to automatically upload because we're not going to be able to do the shows from the beach.

638
00:43:26,461 --> 00:43:31,720
Speaker 1: Well, I mean we probably could but it'd be too much effort going to McDonald's and using the Wi-Fi and plus.

639
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:45,534
Speaker 0: I got to tell you once we get back the week after that We are going to have almost a month worth of content from all the interviews and the coverage of Otacon and the coverage of Wildwood and all the crazy things we're going to do.

640
00:43:45,594 --> 00:43:46,940
Speaker 0: We're bringing all this equipment.

641
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:52,054
Speaker 0: We're gonna record almost everything we do throughout this entire two weeks of awesome.

642
00:43:52,315 --> 00:43:54,080
Speaker 1: It's gonna be pretty freakin crazy.

643
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,076
