1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,374
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday April 29th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:12,298
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:13,580
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:15,284
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,344 --> 00:00:18,630
Speaker 1: Tonight, FTL, Advanced, and Flashpoints.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,429
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,183
Speaker 1: I wanted to stream this show live on Twitch.

8
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:38,380
Speaker 1: I feel like that's a thing we should do, especially because we learned at ZenkaiCon that apparently the height of celebrity for 11 to 11 and a half year olds is being a YouTuber.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,751
Speaker 0: Is that our target audience?

10
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:40,660
Speaker 0: 11 to 11 and a half year olds?

11
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:46,840
Speaker 1: Seems like the most, I don't want to say lucrative, but definitely the most followy and clingy demographic.

12
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:47,739
Speaker 0: Okay.

13
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:50,879
Speaker 1: If we want followers and clingers on, I think that's the way to go.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, just said I want a bunch of 11 year olds coming up to me at conventions.

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,482
Speaker 1: That's what we need to do.

16
00:00:56,104 --> 00:01:01,780
Speaker 1: All of Geek Nights will now just be us silently playing Minecraft and occasionally giggling on a live stream.

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,959
Speaker 0: Ah, Minecraft's not too bad.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:04,361
Speaker 0: Yeah?

19
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:06,348
Speaker 1: So let's start streaming it right now.

20
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:07,432
Speaker 1: No more other Geek Nights.

21
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:09,540
Speaker 1: That is the sole format of Tuesday, henceforth.

22
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:10,499
Speaker 0: Uh, no.

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanted to stream the show, but my camera's so old that I gotta do a little bit of investigation.

24
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:25,400
Speaker 1: It does not like taking an audio input from a mixer into its internal microphone ports.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,059
Speaker 0: Well, how fortuitous is it that today I received a brand new camera, which is the height of camera technology?

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,372
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good camera.

27
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:32,919
Speaker 1: you got there.

28
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:39,833
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess there are better cameras, but this one is the only one that can do 4K videos to an SD card.

29
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:42,438
Speaker 0: in itself that costs as little as it costs.

30
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:43,360
Speaker 0: that isn't just a GoPro.

31
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:45,398
Speaker 0: So there you go.

32
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,182
Speaker 1: Yep.

33
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:49,519
Speaker 1: So now we just gotta integrate it into our pipeline and do the whole thing and then we'll be good to go.

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,806
Speaker 0: Should be pretty good.

35
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:52,218
Speaker 0: It does everything we need it to do.

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,362
Speaker 1: Just watch out.

37
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:57,780
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is gonna be stepping up the game of video production in the coming, I guess, months.

38
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:04,080
Speaker 0: With 4Ks, which is I don't know how many Ps, you're gonna see a lot of rims and face sweat.

39
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:05,442
Speaker 1: Yep.

40
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:06,946
Speaker 1: That's the one trouble.

41
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:12,940
Speaker 1: We can't run the air conditioner in the house when we're doing video because it's too loud, but those lights get way hot.

42
00:02:14,142 --> 00:02:15,459
Speaker 1: So I guess we should start wearing makeup.

43
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:16,599
Speaker 0: That's all you.

44
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,206
Speaker 1: Do the powder?

45
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:18,360
Speaker 1: Gonna powder up?

46
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,799
Speaker 0: Listen, you gotta learn about that.

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,322
Speaker 0: Yeah?

48
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:21,915
Speaker 1: I'll powder you up.

49
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:22,520
Speaker 1: It'll be fine.

50
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:24,276
Speaker 0: Go for it.

51
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:33,080
Speaker 1: So yeah, we'll be starting to stream Tuesday shows on Twitch once I set up a good pipeline and get some more microphones and all that crap.

52
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:41,620
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I guess the biggest news, to talk about it briefly, while we were at PAX East, they announced...

53
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,319
Speaker 0: No, not Zenkai Con?

54
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,178
Speaker 1: PAX South.

55
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:44,211
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

56
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, why would I be talking about PAX?

57
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:51,019
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, I thought you were gonna say while we were at Zenkai Con... Nothing happened.

58
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,858
Speaker 0: Nothing happened.

59
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,162
Speaker 0: Yeah.

60
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:54,460
Speaker 1: While we were at Zenkai Con, we played a bunch of games.

61
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,299
Speaker 1: While we were at PAX, they announced the fourth and final PAX.

62
00:02:59,182 --> 00:02:59,858
Speaker 0: Final PAX.

63
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,090
Speaker 1: There's no more PAXes.

64
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:01,960
Speaker 1: Maximum PAXes.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,371
Speaker 0: Right next to Final Yamato.

66
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:04,400
Speaker 0: The fourth and final.

67
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,980
Speaker 1: So this thus presents a conundrum to the Jet Set gamers and the game industry.

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,433
Speaker 1: Do you go to MAGFest or do you go to PAX South?

69
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,960
Speaker 1: Because they're the same weekend.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,520
Speaker 0: I think this year's a fluke, because MAGFest got moved from New Year's to late January.

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,540
Speaker 0: And then at the same time, it's running from Friday to Monday instead of Thursday to Sunday, which is very strange.

72
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,868
Speaker 1: Which is causing problems for a lot of people.

73
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:31,660
Speaker 1: A lot of people I've talked to are not gonna be there on Monday.

74
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:33,779
Speaker 1: So it's turning into a three-day con because they gotta go to work.

75
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like, I think this year is gonna be a weird MAGFest.

76
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,720
Speaker 0: And next year, MAGFest hopefully will go back to its New Year's, Thursday to Sunday ways.

77
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,240
Speaker 0: And then you'll be able to go to both.

78
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:46,663
Speaker 1: Yep.

79
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:47,445
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

80
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:50,637
Speaker 1: We're probably gonna go to PAX South, but we haven't 100% decided yet.

81
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:54,300
Speaker 1: There's people bothering us in both directions.

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,952
Speaker 0: Listen, I wouldn't mind going someplace warm in January.

83
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,040
Speaker 0: Or at least warmer than New York.

84
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,401
Speaker 1: Yep.

85
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:02,560
Speaker 1: And I figure I've never been to Texas on purpose.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,240
Speaker 0: I've never been to Texas, period.

87
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,320
Speaker 1: Maybe it's time to go there with intent.

88
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,680
Speaker 0: I must admit that I have a slight reason to go there.

89
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,379
Speaker 1: You wanna go to the first of every new PAX?

90
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:15,220
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, that's why I didn't go to the first first PAX.

91
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:15,980
Speaker 1: Go to a Schlitterbahn?

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,720
Speaker 0: For Necro Wombica.

93
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,168
Speaker 1: We wanted to go to that first PAX.

94
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:18,934
Speaker 1: We physically couldn't.

95
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,440
Speaker 0: But there's actually, there's a lot of Netrunner players in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area.

96
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:25,985
Speaker 0: And also Tejas.

97
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:29,380
Speaker 0: So I'm sure there'll be a presence at the PAX South.

98
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,181
Speaker 0: We'll see.

99
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:30,663
Speaker 1: We'll see.

100
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,550
Speaker 1: Plus, fresh audience.

101
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,140
Speaker 1: We can recycle old panels like we do.

102
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,316
Speaker 1: I mean, we fly all the way to Australia last year.

103
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:38,919
Speaker 1: What do we do?

104
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:42,760
Speaker 1: The same panel we ran at the first three PAX Primes in a row.

105
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,379
Speaker 0: You wanna do Beyond D&D at PAX South?

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should do Beyond D&D.

107
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,420
Speaker 1: We're like, you people down here might never have heard of these games.

108
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,859
Speaker 1: Like the burning wheel.

109
00:04:50,402 --> 00:04:51,480
Speaker 0: Down in here in Tejas.

110
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:55,620
Speaker 0: Give me some barbecue and maybe I'll tell you about a game you wanna know about.

111
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,759
Speaker 1: We could go to the Schlitterbahn.

112
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,320
Speaker 0: That's a little far away from San Antonio.

113
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's in Texas.

114
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,532
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's like saying, yeah, it was in Australia.

115
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:06,260
Speaker 0: How come we didn't go there?

116
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,980
Speaker 1: How far did we stray from Melbourne while we were down there?

117
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,656
Speaker 0: Not much.

118
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,425
Speaker 1: I think Phillip Island.

119
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,080
Speaker 1: The bottom of Phillip Island is as far away as we got.

120
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,960
Speaker 1: So yeah, PAX South.

121
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:22,660
Speaker 1: The only thing I can say about it is a lot of people were mad that it wasn't in Chicago.

122
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,405
Speaker 1: Which I can see.

123
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:25,000
Speaker 1: Chicago would have been an equally good choice.

124
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that really is sort of... I mean, Chicago's cool.

125
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:29,740
Speaker 0: I'm down with Chicago.

126
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,760
Speaker 0: You know, the airport really helps it too, right?

127
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,940
Speaker 0: But that's really hurting everyone who lives south, right?

128
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:42,980
Speaker 0: Having three PAXs in the north, right across the top.

129
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,180
Speaker 0: It's like everyone in the south is always far away from PAX.

130
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,340
Speaker 0: This one, by putting it low and in the middle.

131
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,080
Speaker 1: Means people who live in the top middle are still far away from every possible PAX.

132
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,800
Speaker 0: If you live in the top middle, yeah, but at least the south PAX is closer to you than the east or west PAX.

133
00:05:58,206 --> 00:05:58,399
Speaker 1: Yeah.

134
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:58,922
Speaker 1: Right?

135
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:00,740
Speaker 0: If you live in, say, Minnesota.

136
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,060
Speaker 1: But a lot of people speculated if it was in Texas, it would be in Austin.

137
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,138
Speaker 1: I also speculated that because it seemed...

138
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,150
Speaker 0: The culture of Austin is ripe for the PAX.

139
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,740
Speaker 0: However, the other aspects are not ripe.

140
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,580
Speaker 1: Yes, research was done, apparently, and Austin is garbage for a large convention like PAX.

141
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,460
Speaker 1: It just does not have enough hotel space, enough infrastructure.

142
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:24,170
Speaker 0: People point to the SXW, right?

143
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,760
Speaker 0: But the point is, SXW is different from PAX.

144
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,719
Speaker 0: It's sort of a sprawling, all over the town kind of thing.

145
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,520
Speaker 0: Whereas PAX is an all-in-one building kind of thing.

146
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:33,181
Speaker 1: Yep.

147
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:35,818
Speaker 1: And while people say, "Oh, but it's in a bunch of different buildings in

148
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:36,140
Speaker 1: Seattle."

149
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:38,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, those buildings are literally two-minute walks from each other.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,019
Speaker 0: They're connected by sky bridges, those buildings.

151
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:49,020
Speaker 1: And what I find hilarious is that a lot of people who are in the south were trying to argue against it being in San Antonio.

152
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:51,620
Speaker 1: Trying to claim that Austin has plenty of hotels.

153
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,079
Speaker 1: They're only 10 to 20 minute drives away.

154
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,400
Speaker 1: That's clearly showing that these people do not go to a lot of conventions.

155
00:06:57,602 --> 00:06:59,135
Speaker 0: These people live in Texas where cars.

156
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:02,834
Speaker 0: Not understanding the rest of the world.

157
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:03,460
Speaker 0: No cars.

158
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, most of the world is still pretty cars.

159
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,899
Speaker 0: I'm saying civilized world.

160
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:08,830
Speaker 1: Ah, true, true.

161
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,319
Speaker 1: So, New York.

162
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:09,866
Speaker 1: Yeah.

163
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:10,500
Speaker 1: Seattle.

164
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:19,460
Speaker 1: But yeah, go to a PAX East and see how fun it is to try to drive to the convention center 15 minutes every morning.

165
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,340
Speaker 0: If you can't wake up and immediately be in the convention, then that's not a con hotel.

166
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:28,520
Speaker 1: I mean, I was not super happy that we had to stay a 10 minute walk away from PAX East this year.

167
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:33,920
Speaker 1: Though, the dates of the next two PAX Easts are perfectly public.

168
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,940
Speaker 0: Because they're on the website of the Boston Convention Center authority, whatever.

169
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,361
Speaker 0: I checked.

170
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:41,340
Speaker 1: In one month, I could just book a room in the Westin.

171
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:43,019
Speaker 0: Okay.

172
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:43,716
Speaker 1: For us.

173
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:44,600
Speaker 0: Try it.

174
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,477
Speaker 1: Might just do it.

175
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:46,519
Speaker 0: Do whatever you gotta do.

176
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,059
Speaker 1: It might be like another 80 bucks a night, but it might be worth it.

177
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:54,500
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, if you want to go to PAX Prime this year, now is the time to start obsessively following Twitter.

178
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,660
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, you've got that two second window to get into the queue and get your badges.

179
00:07:58,921 --> 00:07:59,500
Speaker 0: And get in the Sheraton.

180
00:07:59,860 --> 00:07:59,983
Speaker 1: Yup.

181
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:03,120
Speaker 0: The thing is- I would click on Sheraton first and badges second.

182
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,144
Speaker 1: Seattle doesn't matter.

183
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:07,300
Speaker 1: If you miss the Sheraton, whatever, the red line's right the fuck there.

184
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,420
Speaker 0: Listen, you might not get the red line either.

185
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:10,626
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

186
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:12,660
Speaker 1: Well, we didn't get the red line either last year.

187
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,318
Speaker 0: That's right.

188
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,815
Speaker 1: Well, we've had trouble because they keep moving stuff around too, but I digress.

189
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:17,940
Speaker 1: We're not making this a PAX show.

190
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:19,327
Speaker 1: So, stay tuned.

191
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,600
Speaker 1: We'll either be at MAGFest or PAX South.

192
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,459
Speaker 1: If you have a very strong opinion as to which one we should go to, email us.

193
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,259
Speaker 1: We'll read your email on the show.

194
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,560
Speaker 0: Speaking of PAX, E3, the show that PAX killed.

195
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:33,318
Speaker 0: Still happens, I guess.

196
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:37,179
Speaker 0: But Nintendo, remember last year they did a weird thing.

197
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,919
Speaker 0: They didn't go to it, but they set up things in all the Best Buys where you could play their games.

198
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,438
Speaker 0: Like, you know, demos of games that weren't out yet and stuff.

199
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:48,940
Speaker 0: So this year, they're doing something similar to that with the Best Buy thing and some other stuff.

200
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:57,895
Speaker 0: But the biggest thing that Nintendo is doing this year that's different is they're going to invite 16 highly skilled Super Smash Bros.

201
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,698
Speaker 0: players to a Super Smash Bros.

202
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:00,660
Speaker 0: Wii U tournament.

203
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,903
Speaker 0: The Smash Bros.

204
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:04,814
Speaker 0: Invitational, which will be held at the Nokia Theater in L.A.

205
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:06,118
Speaker 0: live during E3.

206
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:15,472
Speaker 0: So, is this A, Nintendo recognized, at least Nintendo of America recognized, that Smash Bros.

207
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:20,820
Speaker 0: has competitive scene that's cool and has fans and they could maybe appeal to it, right?

208
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,580
Speaker 0: But, does the game itself appeal to those people?

209
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,820
Speaker 1: That I'm really curious about.

210
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,040
Speaker 0: Because that game was made by Nintendo Japan and not by Nintendo America.

211
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,707
Speaker 1: I mean, we know that Smash Bros.

212
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,131
Speaker 1: Brawl and Smash Bros.

213
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:39,080
Speaker 1: Melee had very strong pro-gamer followings.

214
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,039
Speaker 1: But at the same time, Nintendo has been...

215
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,920
Speaker 0: Well, only really Melee, not Brawl.

216
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,465
Speaker 1: Brawl had one, but it wasn't as big.

217
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:51,000
Speaker 1: Kind of like how Source had one, but 1-6 was still way bigger.

218
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,490
Speaker 0: It was DOA.

219
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:53,259
Speaker 0: The same way that like...

220
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,160
Speaker 1: You gotta be able to wavedash across Fox only, Final Destination, no items.

221
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:06,098
Speaker 0: It was the same way that, you know, if there was a Mario Kart competitive scene, everyone would play Super Circuit, and then when Mario Kart 64 came out, everyone would go, "Fuck it.

222
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:06,759
Speaker 0: No

223
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:06,959
Speaker 0: good.".

224
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:20,260
Speaker 1: But, well, I guess my point is that Nintendo lately, at least with their other primary competition games like Mario Tennis and Mario Kart, have been kind of removing the skill-based movement, to put it lightly.

225
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,700
Speaker 0: Moving the skill-based everything.

226
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:33,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, and it still bothers me that every review I read of the 3DS Mario Tennis neglects to mention that they removed timing as a factor in the game and turned it into a glorified Simon Says.

227
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,033
Speaker 0: But anyway, in this tournament, we're gonna find out, I guess, you know, the truth of whether the new Smash

228
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:39,373
Speaker 0: Bros.,

229
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:42,260
Speaker 0: at least the Wii U version, is competitively viable or not.

230
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,550
Speaker 1: I'm still, I'm worried in general about this sort of bifurcation of their market.

231
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,595
Speaker 1: I mean, the fact that the Smash Bros.

232
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,219
Speaker 1: is on the 3DS and the Wii U...

233
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:51,239
Speaker 0: That's cool.

234
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,928
Speaker 1: Who's gonna buy a Wii U for this game?

235
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:56,600
Speaker 1: Wii U's aren't even selling as it is.

236
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,727
Speaker 0: The Wii U Smash Bros.

237
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,276
Speaker 0: is gonna be different from the 3DS one.

238
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,060
Speaker 1: But will they be different enough to matter?

239
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,081
Speaker 0: It's gonna be different.

240
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:14,100
Speaker 0: It's at different stages, 'cause the one on the 3DS is gonna have mobile, you know, portable stages based on Game Boy games and stuff, and the Wii U one is gonna have stages based on console games.

241
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:21,360
Speaker 1: I cannot foresee a world where there is a competitive circuit in both of these that are both healthy at the same time.

242
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really see a competitive circuit for any portable game that is a real-time game, just because of the nature of portable devices.

243
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,320
Speaker 1: It would be trivial to do it if you built into the system a way to have a spectator mode.

244
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,679
Speaker 0: Sure, but...

245
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:35,426
Speaker 1: It'd be trivial.

246
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:36,900
Speaker 1: Nintendo will never do that.

247
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,896
Speaker 0: I only see competitive gaming, competitive portable gaming for turn-based type games and not for real-time games.

248
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,600
Speaker 0: Also because of the control scheme, right?

249
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,100
Speaker 0: Anyway.

250
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:47,483
Speaker 0: Nah.

251
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:48,740
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's interesting.

252
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,915
Speaker 0: You can't use like a fight stick with a 3DS.

253
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:58,580
Speaker 1: 'Cause there was just a Polygon article I was reading talking about how Nintendo has been by and large radio silence for a while now.

254
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:04,253
Speaker 1: Like as the company does worse and worse and worse, they say less and less and less.

255
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:06,017
Speaker 1: They appear at fewer conventions.

256
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:07,240
Speaker 1: They do fewer things.

257
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,100
Speaker 1: They talk less about anything except when suddenly they release a first-party title or suddenly do some very specific thing like this.

258
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,852
Speaker 0: That's always what they've been doing, but they've just been doing less, right?

259
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:20,220
Speaker 0: That's part of the reason they're failing is doing less.

260
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:29,654
Speaker 0: I read some other article somewhere that was like someone in Nintendo was like, "Yeah, we're an entertainment company.

261
00:12:29,694 --> 00:12:31,077
Speaker 0: People know us for video games.

262
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,819
Speaker 0: We can really make all kinds of

263
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:33,040
Speaker 0: stuff.".

264
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure you can.

265
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,980
Speaker 0: I think we're gonna see Nintendo attempt to make non-video games and fail, probably.

266
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:44,300
Speaker 1: Maybe they're just gonna try to get out of gaming and go into some other direction.

267
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,299
Speaker 0: Who knows what they're gonna do?

268
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,059
Speaker 0: It's hard to say.

269
00:12:46,842 --> 00:12:54,240
Speaker 1: I honestly do not see a significant turnaround happening unless there's a huge shakeup inside of Nintendo's executive management.

270
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,734
Speaker 0: I could see them making certain things they did that succeeded like Wii Fit, right?

271
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,120
Speaker 0: But Wii Fit could have been a standalone device.

272
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,257
Speaker 1: Probably should have been.

273
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:03,720
Speaker 1: Right.

274
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
Speaker 1: I mean, Wii Bowling should have been its own thing.

275
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:13,174
Speaker 0: I can see them going in sort of a direction of making sort of one-off expensive electronic toys, right?

276
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:15,860
Speaker 0: To where you basically get a peripheral with a game built into it.

277
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,820
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean like the Wii?

278
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:17,598
Speaker 0: Yeah.

279
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:17,887
Speaker 1: Heyo!

280
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:19,828
Speaker 0: As opposed to consoles.

281
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,640
Speaker 0: Nick would be pretty successful doing that.

282
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably, but it's just sad that they've gone in such an opposite direction from everything I've ever cared about as a gamer.

283
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,556
Speaker 0: Mmm, oh well.

284
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,080
Speaker 1: Yep.

285
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,280
Speaker 0: 3DS has some good stuff still.

286
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,229
Speaker 1: So in some more interesting news, there's been a lot of talk about this lately.

287
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:41,300
Speaker 1: There's a couple of different forays in this direction, so I'll link to a more generic article about it.

288
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:51,320
Speaker 1: It's pretty possible to design games that, based on the way you play them, can pretty accurately diagnose if you have a lot of mental disorders, like say Alzheimer's.

289
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, you play a memory game and you fail at it, you probably have Alzheimer's, right?

290
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,100
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's a little more complicated than that.

291
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:07,580
Speaker 1: But Alzheimer's and diseases like it have pretty specific pathologies and pretty specific sets of symptoms.

292
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:11,313
Speaker 1: There's certain keys, there's certain signs that really home in on.

293
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:12,940
Speaker 1: this person very likely has it.

294
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:14,340
Speaker 0: As opposed to just bad memory?

295
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:30,160
Speaker 1: The primary test is they'll do a PET scan to look for those amyloid plaques in your brain, but apparently certain behaviors in games related to filtering information and remembering certain kinds of data are equally indicative of Alzheimer's.

296
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,000
Speaker 0: So someone with bad memory... It's not just bad memory.

297
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,920
Speaker 0: Right, would fail at the game differently than someone with Alzheimer's would fail at it.

298
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,641
Speaker 1: Exactly.

299
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,747
Speaker 1: And this concept is not something new.

300
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:41,712
Speaker 1: At MagFest, on that panel we had with Dr.

301
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:44,520
Speaker 1: Hazard about privacy in games, we talked about this a lot.

302
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:48,700
Speaker 1: This is a really thorny area for games to go into.

303
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,487
Speaker 0: Right, what if I make a game and I just market it like, "Buy this game

304
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:52,068
Speaker 0: everybody!"

305
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:56,760
Speaker 0: and then I use that game to basically learn a lot of information about the players.

306
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:58,070
Speaker 1: Is that ethical?

307
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,240
Speaker 1: And the answer is we don't know.

308
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:08,940
Speaker 0: I get that information not from them typing it in or from them clicking, "I agree, let me tell you about myself," but just from the data of them playing, I learn about them.

309
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,164
Speaker 1: Or here's some specific ethics.

310
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:15,640
Speaker 1: Let's say you design a game that happens to detect if someone has Alzheimer's and it's pretty accurate.

311
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:22,680
Speaker 1: That does not count as a medical device, not really covered by a lot of the laws and regulations about medical devices.

312
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:22,920
Speaker 1: Nope.

313
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:31,938
Speaker 0: But now if somebody hacks into my game's database and collects all the player data, they can say, "That person has Alzheimer's, that person

314
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:32,238
Speaker 0: doesn't.".

315
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:37,220
Speaker 0: And that's on the internet, and then someone's hiring someone.

316
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,402
Speaker 1: Me as a game designer.

317
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,645
Speaker 1: Maybe I run the servers for some game.

318
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:41,927
Speaker 1: And then I discover this.

319
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:49,099
Speaker 1: Do I have an ethical duty to reach out to everyone who tests positive in my game and say, "Yo, dawg, you should go to a

320
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:49,520
Speaker 1: doctor."?

321
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,424
Speaker 1: Is that creepy or not?

322
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:59,340
Speaker 1: These are the kinds of questions that no one has been asking ever, even though this has been a possibility for decades.

323
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,100
Speaker 0: What if I have goggles, and if I put the goggles on, anyone who has AIDS is red and anyone who doesn't have AIDS is green.

324
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,230
Speaker 0: Should I make sure that every person I see who's red knows they have AIDS?

325
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:12,835
Speaker 0: Or HIV, I guess.

326
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:14,560
Speaker 0: If they had AIDS, they would know, but HIV.

327
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:16,988
Speaker 1: Maybe I should get the video of that panel and stick it online.

328
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:18,473
Speaker 1: I got it laying around somewhere for MagFest.

329
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:20,380
Speaker 1: Bad camera angle and bad audio and all.

330
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:29,760
Speaker 1: But the point that was brought up in that panel was that games are much more powerful than most other mechanisms of eliciting information about a person.

331
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:32,500
Speaker 0: About brain-related things, usually.

332
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:40,600
Speaker 1: Body things, too, because you're seeing that person interact with a controlled environment, which is pretty much any researcher's dream.

333
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:52,560
Speaker 0: It would be hard to tell someone's hair color unless it was a game where they made an avatar, and then I could figure out if they're the kind of person who makes an avatar that looks like them or not.

334
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,280
Speaker 1: And there's probably some way to tell that.

335
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:55,822
Speaker 0: Right.

336
00:16:55,842 --> 00:17:04,138
Speaker 0: But if they're the kind of person who doesn't make an avatar that looks like them, all I can say is, "Well, their hair probably isn't the same as their avatar, but I don't know what their hair

337
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,339
Speaker 0: is.".

338
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,680
Speaker 1: But then, of course, by aggregating other things, you can figure that out.

339
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,018
Speaker 0: And then I access their webcam, and then that's it.

340
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:21,099
Speaker 1: But this kind of goes all the way back to, like, I've known people who get really unnerved if I wear Google Glass around them, but I have zero problem with me playing a 3DS with the cameras on the front of it pointed right at them.

341
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,359
Speaker 0: Because they're stupid.

342
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,711
Speaker 1: So games are definitely a blind spot when it comes to privacy.

343
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:27,338
Speaker 1: People don't think about games.

344
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:27,980
Speaker 1: No one thinks.

345
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:36,360
Speaker 0: Well, why don't we just jump on this and get ahead of the game and make a web game that's really simple but collects data about the players that we can sell for money?

346
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:36,922
Speaker 1: Ah.

347
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:43,160
Speaker 1: Well, this article links to a company that is making the Alzheimer's game to use as a diagnostic tool.

348
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,021
Speaker 0: Well, that's fine.

349
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:44,903
Speaker 0: That's totally cool.

350
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:48,388
Speaker 0: I'm talking about, you know, not Alzheimer's, but something valuable.

351
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:56,700
Speaker 0: Like, we have a game, people play the game, and from their play data only, we figure out what kind of products they want to buy.

352
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,222
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait.

353
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,028
Speaker 1: There's a much better way to go about this, Scott.

354
00:17:59,208 --> 00:17:59,931
Speaker 1: Here's how we do it.

355
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,740
Speaker 1: Find a game that figures out who's gullible.

356
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:04,140
Speaker 0: And then sell them shit.

357
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,040
Speaker 1: And then sell them homeopathy.

358
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,354
Speaker 0: Sell them something garbage that we can make a lot of money on.

359
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:10,479
Speaker 0: We could do that.

360
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,600
Speaker 1: You know, remember at RIT when we were going to sell that magic fairy dust to people?

361
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:16,760
Speaker 1: It's a good thing.

362
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,782
Speaker 0: I think it might be.

363
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:21,860
Speaker 0: That's actually a really difficult challenge, though, to make a game that detects people who are gullible.

364
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:29,020
Speaker 0: Because when you play a game, you sort of trust anyone, even the non-gullible person, trust the thing the game is telling you, right?

365
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,549
Speaker 0: When you play Zelda, and old man says, "The dango dislikes smoke,".

366
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,420
Speaker 0: you are 100% goddamn sure the bomb is going to use the dango.

367
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:45,079
Speaker 1: Ah, but at the same time, when I played Castlevania 2 and someone told me there's a bum dealer selling whacked out goods in this town, I probably shouldn't have trusted him.

368
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:46,558
Speaker 0: Well, you know.

369
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,053
Speaker 1: He also told me not to look into the Death Star or I might die.

370
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:51,860
Speaker 1: And there is no Death Star in that game.

371
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:59,140
Speaker 0: The point is, in good games, right, non-gullible people just sort of trust everything the game is telling them.

372
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:06,760
Speaker 0: Games tend not to lie to their players, and when they do, it's sort of in an obvious way, like Portal does and such like that, right?

373
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,967
Speaker 1: You gotta think outside the box.

374
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:13,340
Speaker 1: This kind of interrogation of a person's brain through a game is not that straightforward.

375
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,568
Speaker 1: It's not just, "Oh, they're gullible in the game,".

376
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:16,694
Speaker 1: then they're gullible in real life.

377
00:19:16,895 --> 00:19:17,940
Speaker 1: They kill people in the game.

378
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:23,400
Speaker 0: It would still be, I think, rather difficult to make a game that detects the player's gullibility level.

379
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,807
Speaker 1: Well, no, what you do is you do it empirically.

380
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:27,240
Speaker 1: You do controlled studies of people, find gullible people.

381
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,072
Speaker 0: Right, that's not easy, is what I'm saying.

382
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:30,300
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's not possible.

383
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,480
Speaker 1: I'll bet we could go find a bunch of gullible people, just have a sign that says, "Fifty dollars, come take this test," and we give them a check.

384
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:46,060
Speaker 1: And then we have a list of people who are gullible, we have them all play a game, then we have a bunch of non-gullible people play a game, figure out a statistical difference between the two, and then BAM!

385
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:48,055
Speaker 0: Alright, go do it, Mr.

386
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:48,440
Speaker 0: Genius.

387
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, Old Road Man told me that I have a friend in the town of Aldra, and I should go see him.

388
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:53,029
Speaker 0: Oh.

389
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,533
Speaker 1: And for a hundred hearts I can buy a thorn whip.

390
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:56,420
Speaker 1: I guess that guy wasn't lying.

391
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,849
Speaker 0: Please introduce me to this man.

392
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:59,579
Speaker 0: I am interested in what he has to offer.

393
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:08,170
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day!

394
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,284
Speaker 1: There's a video that's very relevant to these windy times here in New York.

395
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:13,810
Speaker 1: Porta Potty escaped.

396
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:15,170
Speaker 0: What?

397
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,510
Speaker 1: This porta potty just flies down the road like it's possessed in the wind.

398
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:20,270
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

399
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,510
Speaker 1: And it just keeps going.

400
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,310
Speaker 0: I'm guessing it wasn't weighed down very much if it escaped so easily.

401
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:28,430
Speaker 1: You know, I hope against hope that someone was in that porta potty.

402
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:30,517
Speaker 0: How could it fly away if someone's in it?

403
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:32,325
Speaker 0: How light is that person?

404
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:33,390
Speaker 0: Maybe a small child.

405
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,909
Speaker 1: That could be just really strong wind.

406
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,701
Speaker 0: How's a tornado?

407
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:37,450
Speaker 0: I mean, come on.

408
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,070
Speaker 1: Well, there were just a bunch of tornadoes.

409
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,985
Speaker 0: This is why, if you look at porta potties, they're usually chained down.

410
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:44,130
Speaker 0: The reason they're chained down is...

411
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,129
Speaker 1: So people don't steal them.

412
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,178
Speaker 0: Yes, so people don't steal them primarily.

413
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:50,030
Speaker 0: But secondly, so that the worst that can happen is they fall over.

414
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:51,032
Speaker 1: Ah!

415
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:52,358
Speaker 1: It's everywhere.

416
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:54,446
Speaker 1: It's in my raccoon wounds.

417
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,270
Speaker 0: Ah!

418
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,096
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is a tweet.

419
00:20:59,236 --> 00:21:00,941
Speaker 0: The tweet has a photo attached to it.

420
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:04,050
Speaker 0: The tweet plus the photo are hilarious and creative.

421
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:06,630
Speaker 0: And it'll take you like two seconds to look at this.

422
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,647
Speaker 1: Probably shouldn't spoil it.

423
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,050
Speaker 0: It's self-explanatory.

424
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:11,989
Speaker 1: I hope it's self-explanatory.

425
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,710
Speaker 0: But it was so clever and I lolled, for reals.

426
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,029
Speaker 1: I also lolled out loud.

427
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:17,969
Speaker 0: I rofled, maybe.

428
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:18,667
Speaker 1: I lolled out loud.

429
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,390
Speaker 0: I didn't literally rofl, but it was rofl level.

430
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,649
Speaker 1: See, I'll never say rofl unless I'm literally doing it.

431
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:24,710
Speaker 0: You'll never say rofl level.

432
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,010
Speaker 1: I'll never type lol unless I actually articulated laughter out loud.

433
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,689
Speaker 0: I guess if I tickle you, you can say rofl.

434
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,154
Speaker 1: Lull.

435
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:36,887
Speaker 1: So, the book club book is...

436
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,670
Speaker 0: Oh, what's the name of the stupid book?

437
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,388
Speaker 1: It's your book.

438
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:39,970
Speaker 0: Yeah.

439
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:41,910
Speaker 1: A candidate for Liebowitz, captain.

440
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,768
Speaker 0: That's the name, yup.

441
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:44,690
Speaker 0: The one with the Jesus guy in the front.

442
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:48,630
Speaker 1: It might be one of the earlier instances of one of our favorite genres.

443
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,470
Speaker 0: The post-apocalypse humans are trapped inside of a sealed society genre.

444
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:53,910
Speaker 1: Yup.

445
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,362
Speaker 0: At least that's what I've been told.

446
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:57,390
Speaker 0: I have actually no clue.

447
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,369
Speaker 0: It could be not that.

448
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,150
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's post-apocalyptic, though.

449
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:07,549
Speaker 0: And it's also older than every other example of the genre that I know, including Fallout, Logan's Run, et cetera, et cetera.

450
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:15,169
Speaker 1: The most apt complaint I've heard about the book is that the way information is stored in the modern era would make that book not work out.

451
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,350
Speaker 0: Oh, it's one of those where at the time... Yeah, okay.

452
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:26,586
Speaker 1: Yeah, the complaint levied, and this is not having read the book and not knowing anything about it, someone says something to the effect of, "Yeah, but that only works if everything's

453
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:26,909
Speaker 1: printed.".

454
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:27,290
Speaker 0: Sure.

455
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:34,407
Speaker 0: Well, that's like complaining about a sci-fi story from the '80s and said, "Yeah, that only works if they didn't have cell

456
00:22:34,427 --> 00:22:34,790
Speaker 0: phones.".

457
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,509
Speaker 1: That only works if there's no phlogiston out there.

458
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,035
Speaker 0: Yeah, right?

459
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:42,170
Speaker 0: It's like total recall if they had cell phones.

460
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,710
Speaker 1: In the meantime, Kineticon is coming up in July.

461
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:49,430
Speaker 1: We're in the middle of the final stages of scheduling the convention.

462
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:56,369
Speaker 1: So if you didn't submit your panel, I've been telling you to do that shit for like a year, so you missed the boat.

463
00:22:56,795 --> 00:22:57,025
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

464
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,673
Speaker 1: Yeah.

465
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:58,970
Speaker 1: You should still come to Kineticon.

466
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,119
Speaker 0: That ship has sailed.

467
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,990
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't you come to Kineticon?

468
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,690
Speaker 1: Because it's actually a pretty badass goddamn con.

469
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:06,669
Speaker 1: It's got better board gaming than the majority of board game-focused conventions.

470
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,110
Speaker 0: You know, usually we complain about conventions because they're in a bad location, Zank icon.

471
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:11,910
Speaker 0: But...

472
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,180
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

473
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:18,910
Speaker 1: In the meta-meta moment, you guys do not understand what I had to put up with this past weekend in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

474
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,427
Speaker 1: But you know what?

475
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:20,849
Speaker 0: Here's a one-act play.

476
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:21,451
Speaker 1: R.I.M.

477
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:24,310
Speaker 1: playing the role of Scott in a small town.

478
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,355
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

479
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:27,649
Speaker 1: I can't get a bagel and everything closes.

480
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:33,830
Speaker 1: Why is everyone so stupid and provincial and the food sucks and I'm bored and I want to go home and everything sucks?

481
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,150
Speaker 0: Lancaster is better than Hartford, Connecticut.

482
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,199
Speaker 1: That is true.

483
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:40,449
Speaker 0: However... As bad as Lancaster is...

484
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:41,500
Speaker 1: I was disappointed.

485
00:23:41,682 --> 00:23:42,450
Speaker 1: I was led to believe...

486
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,590
Speaker 0: But that being said, Kineticon is way better than Zank icon.

487
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,985
Speaker 1: I was led to believe...

488
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:46,390
Speaker 0: Sorry, Zank icon.

489
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,310
Speaker 1: By native Pennsylvanians that Lancaster was known for having really good food.

490
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,590
Speaker 1: That food was pretty average.

491
00:23:53,210 --> 00:24:03,270
Speaker 0: The good food of Lancaster was the Amish food, which is mostly baked sugary goods, such as whoopie pies and the like, which were quite good.

492
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:03,710
Speaker 0: Yes.

493
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,749
Speaker 0: But the rest of the...

494
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:06,650
Speaker 1: And they were like a dollar.

495
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:13,910
Speaker 0: I'm sure if I cooked food using the fresh ingredients of the farmers market, like those beautiful looking meats, it would also have been very good.

496
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,770
Speaker 1: Those meats did not look any fresher than the meats we get in good delis here, however.

497
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,460
Speaker 0: No, but you know, whatever.

498
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,870
Speaker 0: They had nice vegetables and everything.

499
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:29,826
Speaker 0: The fact is, the foods that were cooked for dinner in restaurants were not particularly exciting in any way.

500
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:36,830
Speaker 1: Also, our waitress refused to say the name of the beer we wanted to order because the word "bastard" is such a cuss word.

501
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,628
Speaker 1: She couldn't bring herself to say it.

502
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,005
Speaker 0: Listen, if there was a beer called...

503
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,770
Speaker 1: She seemed really unhappy when we were all talking about bestiality at the table.

504
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:56,090
Speaker 0: If there was a beer called "Fuck you if you drink this" in New York, I don't think there is a single waiter, waitress or bartender of any kind that would not say it without a thought.

505
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,968
Speaker 1: Oh, do you want the oak aged "Fuck you" or the original "Fuck you"?

506
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:07,269
Speaker 1: I remember as a kid there was a controversy in grocery stores in Michigan because they carried this item that was called "Hot Damn".

507
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,339
Speaker 0: Do you want to drink "Bitch Reaper 9000" or "Rim Fucker Outer Space Model"?

508
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:17,490
Speaker 0: I don't know, but I tried to think of the craziest possible name I could think of.

509
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,510
Speaker 1: How come every crazy example you come up with involves me and fucking?

510
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:21,228
Speaker 0: I don't know.

511
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,393
Speaker 1: Without fail.

512
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:28,670
Speaker 1: I seem to recall a similar discussion from like 2007.

513
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,149
Speaker 0: My brain just tries to naturally insult you at all times.

514
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:33,850
Speaker 1: With fucking, apparently.

515
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,349
Speaker 0: What's more insulting than that?

516
00:25:35,772 --> 00:25:37,330
Speaker 1: I think that's the opposite of insulting.

517
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:38,188
Speaker 0: Alright.

518
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:40,670
Speaker 1: I remember a point when someone was describing...

519
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,389
Speaker 0: So when I say "Fuck you" you should say "Why thank you".

520
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:45,421
Speaker 1: The thing is, I wouldn't even hear it.

521
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:46,330
Speaker 1: That's like saying comma.

522
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,228
Speaker 1: How do you say that?

523
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:49,642
Speaker 1: Just pause.

524
00:25:49,703 --> 00:25:51,090
Speaker 1: It's just a pause between two words.

525
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:51,958
Speaker 0: Go fuck yourself.

526
00:25:51,998 --> 00:25:52,648
Speaker 0: Don't mind if I do.

527
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,130
Speaker 1: So anyway, yeah.

528
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,230
Speaker 1: Connecticut is actually really awesome.

529
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:59,028
Speaker 1: And I wouldn't fly across the country to go to it.

530
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:05,290
Speaker 1: But if you live within a day's travel of Hartford, Connecticut it's the best thing that ever happens in Hartford, Connecticut.

531
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:07,049
Speaker 0: That's absolutely true.

532
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,147
Speaker 0: Well, since the last Hartford Whalers game.

533
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,936
Speaker 1: [laughter] So yeah.

534
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,483
Speaker 1: We were gonna stream the show live and our plan was to see.

535
00:26:18,504 --> 00:26:19,149
Speaker 1: you guys know...

536
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,386
Speaker 0: Well, plan A...

537
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,470
Speaker 1: Play Mario 3 and go for points.

538
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,092
Speaker 0: Right.

539
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:25,250
Speaker 0: And play till game over.

540
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,590
Speaker 0: I realized that's gonna take for fuck ever.

541
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,183
Speaker 0: So plan B...

542
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,890
Speaker 1: The only way it would not take for fuck ever is if one of us sucked enough to run out of lives.

543
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:37,190
Speaker 0: Plan B was to do the same exact thing but only just play NES ice hockey since it's ice hockey season.

544
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,950
Speaker 1: But that does not turn into a podcast because we've already done a show on ice hockey.

545
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:41,231
Speaker 0: Right.

546
00:26:41,252 --> 00:26:42,468
Speaker 0: What podcast would we do?

547
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:45,949
Speaker 0: It's like... Even if we do the stream, right?

548
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,830
Speaker 0: If you think the audio of us talking and the game audio while we're streaming how does that make a podcast?

549
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,509
Speaker 0: It won't be a very good podcast at all.

550
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:58,990
Speaker 1: Now I think for the Mario 3 one it could have been because basically that's the kind of game where I would tell a lot of anecdotes while I was playing.

551
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:06,790
Speaker 1: But ice hockey, the best we could do is describe ice hockey in a manner that we've already done on Geek Nights.

552
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:09,790
Speaker 1: We might still stream ice hockey.

553
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:10,370
Speaker 1: We'll see how we feel.

554
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,670
Speaker 1: But we're slowly ramping up to start streaming the Tuesday shows on Twitch.

555
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,989
Speaker 1: But luckily we both played a bunch of games.

556
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:20,390
Speaker 1: We're not gonna review Honors of Teutonica yet even though we've said we're gonna do it very soon.

557
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,029
Speaker 0: We've definitely played that more than other games we've reviewed on this show.

558
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,890
Speaker 0: But it's actually got a lot going on in that game and to make a good show about it.

559
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,769
Speaker 0: we should play it a lot more.

560
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:31,570
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm kind of tired.

561
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:39,270
Speaker 1: We've been doing a lot of... By the standard of reviews of games we've still been doing pretty deep analyses of these games.

562
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,949
Speaker 1: But by the standard of us reviewing Puerto Rico we really haven't been doing that.

563
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:46,850
Speaker 1: I want to give that level of review to Honors of Teutonica.

564
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the game I've played a bunch of times is a lot of fun playing.

565
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the best board game I've come across in recent memory.

566
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:55,590
Speaker 0: It's not even that new, but yeah.

567
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:58,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I stand by my statement.

568
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:04,490
Speaker 1: What games are comparable to it in terms of level of mental engagement and brain feel?

569
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,109
Speaker 0: You know, Netrunner is way beyond that.

570
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:06,958
Speaker 0: You should try it out.

571
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:07,930
Speaker 0: I heard it's pretty good.

572
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,729
Speaker 1: I've heard it's okay.

573
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:11,949
Speaker 0: And it's always changing so it never gets old.

574
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,570
Speaker 1: But Eclipse gives me this sort of Master of Orion, Star Control sort of feeling.

575
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,628
Speaker 1: Not quite the same thing.

576
00:28:19,092 --> 00:28:23,410
Speaker 1: Actually, I've been kind of feeling like playing Star Control 2 again after I've been reading this last Culture book.

577
00:28:24,112 --> 00:28:28,908
Speaker 1: This Culture book is basically all about... It's basically, "Hey, this is now the Star Control 2

578
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:29,210
Speaker 1: universe.".

579
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,549
Speaker 0: It's pretty similar.

580
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:37,010
Speaker 1: Imagine how homogenizing storms are flying around and there's all these aliens trying to scavenge a civilization.

581
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:38,050
Speaker 1: that's a precursor.

582
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:40,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, good stuff going on.

583
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,590
Speaker 1: So yeah, FTL got an update.

584
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:44,869
Speaker 1: And Flashpoint...

585
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,769
Speaker 0: That's your jam, isn't it?

586
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,516
Speaker 1: It is my jam.

587
00:28:46,537 --> 00:28:48,670
Speaker 1: And Flashpoint is a co-op board game about firefighters.

588
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,314
Speaker 0: That's right.

589
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:50,970
Speaker 0: How could you beat that theme?

590
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a pretty good theme.

591
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:54,710
Speaker 0: So what do they change in the new FTL room?

592
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:56,750
Speaker 0: Did we already do an FTL show?

593
00:28:57,332 --> 00:28:59,409
Speaker 1: I do not know if we did, and I will look that up.

594
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,707
Speaker 1: But basically, FTL, which is a fantastic game on the PC.

595
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,089
Speaker 1: And I guess it's on the iPad now.

596
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:08,929
Speaker 1: Yes, we did do a show on FTL.

597
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,290
Speaker 0: Alright, so just talk about the expansion.

598
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,050
Speaker 1: It got an update that added a ridiculous amount of stuff to the game.

599
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I like FTL a lot.

600
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:17,890
Speaker 0: It's really good.

601
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:23,945
Speaker 0: But I had the kind of attitude where I played it, I beat it on easy, and then I'm like, "I really don't feel like playing this

602
00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:24,348
Speaker 0: anymore.".

603
00:29:24,812 --> 00:29:27,870
Speaker 1: I continued to play it because it's such a fun game.

604
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:35,328
Speaker 0: The expansion, though... I watched Rim play it on the train a little bit, and I'm like, "I should probably play that at

605
00:29:35,368 --> 00:29:35,509
Speaker 0: least.".

606
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,749
Speaker 0: I don't think I'd play it constantly like you do, but I could play this a few more times.

607
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:44,209
Speaker 1: Well, I think what does it is when you saw those weird weapons, and every one of them is actually really complex.

608
00:29:45,112 --> 00:29:49,050
Speaker 1: Like the flak cannons, and the chain lasers, and the stun guns.

609
00:29:49,191 --> 00:29:50,689
Speaker 0: Chain lasers sounds like my kind of weapon.

610
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:59,129
Speaker 1: Or the ion drone that you shoot into an enemy ship, and it moves around inside like an intruder, randomly ioning shit.

611
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,804
Speaker 0: So it'll move to a room, it's like,

612
00:30:00,905 --> 00:30:01,209
Speaker 0: "Bzzah!"

613
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,310
Speaker 0: And it's a robot, so if it ions the oxygen, it don't give a fuck.

614
00:30:05,154 --> 00:30:05,909
Speaker 0: Everyone else, though.

615
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:09,010
Speaker 1: Also, you can play as those energy people.

616
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:12,710
Speaker 0: I want to get a ship with an entirely robot crew, so I don't have to have oxygen.

617
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,547
Speaker 1: So one of the races, they deplete oxygen from the room.

618
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:18,669
Speaker 1: they're in, rapidly, like they're a breach.

619
00:30:19,394 --> 00:30:20,490
Speaker 1: And they don't need oxygen.

620
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:26,790
Speaker 1: Their base ship comes with one human, so I just leave him locked in the cockpit, and it's the only place that has oxygen.

621
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,609
Speaker 0: Oh, you just open all the other doors?

622
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:29,750
Speaker 1: I just open all the other doors.

623
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,430
Speaker 0: And if there's a fire in there, he just puts it out?

624
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, he can put it out pretty okay.

625
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:37,030
Speaker 1: I can't send one of his crewmates in, though, because they'll kill him by accident.

626
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,330
Speaker 1: But, basically, FTL is super fun.

627
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:44,030
Speaker 0: Why don't you just get another alien that doesn't need oxygen, and kill the human?

628
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:45,929
Speaker 1: That's not a bad strategy.

629
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,009
Speaker 1: Or, like, they added clone bays.

630
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:56,070
Speaker 1: So instead of just having a med bay and losing a guy is a big deal, every time someone dies, their clone pops out, basically, immediately.

631
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,290
Speaker 0: So you can never die from having all your guys killed?

632
00:30:58,636 --> 00:30:58,808
Speaker 1: Nope.

633
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:05,830
Speaker 0: So why wouldn't you just immediately get the teleporter, send borders, when they die, immediately send the new cloned borders?

634
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:10,150
Speaker 1: Yes, I had a game where I had two Mantis crew members, a teleporter, and a clone bay.

635
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,049
Speaker 1: You know what that meant?

636
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,349
Speaker 1: Infinite Mantises up your ass.

637
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:14,743
Speaker 0: That's amazing.

638
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:15,250
Speaker 0: That's my favorite.

639
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:19,210
Speaker 1: It's basically a constant stream of two Mantises eating their oxygen.

640
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,860
Speaker 0: Then you invest everything.

641
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,970
Speaker 0: You don't even need to get weapons.

642
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,750
Speaker 0: Just invest everything in shields, engines, and hull, and whatever.

643
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,949
Speaker 1: Maybe like a breach bomb or an anti-bio.

644
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:29,308
Speaker 0: Maybe something like that.

645
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,880
Speaker 1: But it added hacking.

646
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:31,990
Speaker 1: It added a million more drones.

647
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:33,140
Speaker 0: How does the hacking work?

648
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,210
Speaker 0: You control their ship and make it not--.

649
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,850
Speaker 1: So you send a drone part, and you target a spot.

650
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,709
Speaker 1: It hits that spot and locks that system out.

651
00:31:40,393 --> 00:31:41,490
Speaker 0: So even more than ion?

652
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:45,969
Speaker 1: And anyone who's in the room is trapped in there unless they break down the door.

653
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,309
Speaker 1: It's pretty good stuff.

654
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,589
Speaker 1: And they enabled the enemies just as much as you.

655
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,694
Speaker 0: So that would be cool.

656
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:54,370
Speaker 0: You could find a strategy for your boarding.

657
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,150
Speaker 0: It's like they have Mantis Men.

658
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,730
Speaker 0: I'll trap one of their Mantis Men in a room and kill the other people.

659
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,309
Speaker 0: The Mantis Man can't come out to fight yet.

660
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,030
Speaker 0: Then when he does come out to fight, two on one.

661
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:03,890
Speaker 1: So here's what I'll say.

662
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:07,370
Speaker 1: We already have reviewed FTL, so I'm not going to review FTL and why I like it.

663
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,450
Speaker 0: We're talking about advanced FTL strategies now.

664
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,710
Speaker 1: But the advanced FTL one, if you already own FTL, it just came automatically.

665
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,635
Speaker 1: You don't have to do anything.

666
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:17,950
Speaker 1: You can turn that mode on or off.

667
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,569
Speaker 1: So you can play classic--.

668
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,890
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought I was going to have to buy something.

669
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:21,789
Speaker 1: No, it's already in there.

670
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,910
Speaker 1: You can play classic or advanced mode.

671
00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:26,770
Speaker 1: So they didn't get rid of the old mode, which is good.

672
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,024
Speaker 0: You know, I kick started FTL.

673
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:28,489
Speaker 0: I got it.

674
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,730
Speaker 1: The old mode is a little more constrained, and it's super fun.

675
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,870
Speaker 1: I mean, I could just beat it on normal pretty much trivially.

676
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:49,130
Speaker 1: But the advanced mode has so many different systems and so many more events, and they've just cleaned the game up a lot, that it's worth revisiting, and it's gotten to the point to where the immersion behavior can be very unpredictable at times.

677
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,190
Speaker 0: You know, FTL has a really sort of old school business model.

678
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,950
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not old school because it was kick started, but it's pretty much just like buy this game, right?

679
00:32:57,472 --> 00:33:03,089
Speaker 0: And then we updated the game, and we don't charge any more for it, but we're hoping a bunch of people who didn't own it before will now buy it.

680
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:06,089
Speaker 0: I'm wondering how financially successful FTL is.

681
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:11,850
Speaker 1: I have no idea, but the game doesn't require too significant a technology to run.

682
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,730
Speaker 0: I'm sure the iPad version will make them a lot of money.

683
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,870
Speaker 1: While it is complex, it is complex in a very constrained fashion.

684
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:22,010
Speaker 1: There are some broken combos I've discovered.

685
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:23,150
Speaker 0: Oh, like what?

686
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,478
Speaker 1: Wow, you want to know?

687
00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:26,130
Speaker 1: The thing is, it's hard to get the broken combo.

688
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,530
Speaker 0: Everything's hard to get.

689
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:31,750
Speaker 0: I mean, what's the thing to get early that lets you reclaim the garbage?

690
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,889
Speaker 1: Oh, the scrap recovery arm?

691
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,434
Speaker 0: The scrap recovery.

692
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:34,361
Speaker 0: You get that immediately.

693
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:35,430
Speaker 0: It's just like, I win.

694
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:48,690
Speaker 1: I've discovered that if you have a combination of the heavy ion cannon that just goes pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, and one of the flak cannons, you are pretty fucking invincible if you can manage the rest of your stuff effectively.

695
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,210
Speaker 0: So you ion all their weapons, and then any weapons that do fire get flaked?

696
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,050
Speaker 1: What I do is I ion the weapons, and I flak the shields.

697
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,410
Speaker 1: Flak also does hull damage, and then I just wait.

698
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,309
Speaker 0: Oh, and they can't hurt you because all their weapons are ioned?

699
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:02,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, that usually works out pretty well.

700
00:34:02,712 --> 00:34:05,010
Speaker 0: And then you get through their shields because flak keeps the shields away?

701
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,870
Speaker 1: And then for your third weapon, get a missile or a bomb or a burst laser.

702
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:09,670
Speaker 1: It doesn't really matter.

703
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:15,929
Speaker 0: I feel like the key to winning, though, on even the hardest modes, you have to basically take the ships intact.

704
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,830
Speaker 1: You know, that has never been my strategy.

705
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:19,212
Speaker 0: Really?

706
00:34:19,232 --> 00:34:21,429
Speaker 0: Because if you destroy the ships, you just get so much less.

707
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:23,389
Speaker 0: You don't get that much more.

708
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,810
Speaker 0: But on really hard modes, you need every resource you can get.

709
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,070
Speaker 1: But at the same time, on hard modes, just optimize a little bit better, and it doesn't matter.

710
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:30,849
Speaker 0: Maybe.

711
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:39,949
Speaker 1: Your problem -- I've watched you play this game on basic mode, even -- is you only level things up that you can power fully, and you always want to power everything all the time.

712
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,668
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't I?

713
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,790
Speaker 1: Because that's physically impossible to do toward the endgame.

714
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:49,670
Speaker 1: You cannot run a full complement of drones and weapons and shields and engines.

715
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,469
Speaker 1: You just can't do it.

716
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,889
Speaker 0: Then don't put all those things in the game if I can't have them all at once.

717
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:56,188
Speaker 0: Or let me have a fleet of ships so I can at least have a drone ship.

718
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,069
Speaker 1: Yes, Scott, play Agricola.

719
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,490
Speaker 1: Can you all animal and bread?

720
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:01,409
Speaker 0: I can if everyone else sucks.

721
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:09,210
Speaker 1: The thing is, this game feels so powerful and satisfying, but it almost feels easy with the advanced mode.

722
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:14,310
Speaker 1: But then an enemy ship uses one of these fancy things on you, and suddenly the game really fucking sucks.

723
00:35:15,312 --> 00:35:17,082
Speaker 1: It's like, "Oh, my oxygen's being hacked.

724
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:17,545
Speaker 1: Oh,

725
00:35:17,706 --> 00:35:18,088
Speaker 1: fuck.".

726
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:20,029
Speaker 0: You get boarded, and then they have clones.

727
00:35:21,574 --> 00:35:23,990
Speaker 0: A sea of mantis men coming your way, I just quit.

728
00:35:25,774 --> 00:35:26,381
Speaker 0: Or I'd run.

729
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:26,906
Speaker 0: I'd be like, "Run

730
00:35:26,946 --> 00:35:27,108
Speaker 0: away.".

731
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,909
Speaker 1: They also updated the AI, so they pretty much go straight for my oxygen and my weapons.

732
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:32,592
Speaker 0: Damn it.

733
00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:35,370
Speaker 0: I have to upgrade my security doors, keep them out of there.

734
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,530
Speaker 1: I don't know if that updated AI is included if you turn off advanced mode or not.

735
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,510
Speaker 1: I don't think it is, but I'm not sure.

736
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,415
Speaker 0: Oh, that's interesting.

737
00:35:42,456 --> 00:35:44,550
Speaker 0: Like, you get the updated AI in regular mode?

738
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,489
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's the case or not.

739
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:47,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, interesting.

740
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:49,650
Speaker 1: I suspect you don't, but again, I don't know.

741
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,089
Speaker 1: I'd have to play regular mode to figure it out.

742
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,590
Speaker 1: So, yeah, the FTL, if you forgot that you own this game, just turn on advanced mode and go crazy.

743
00:35:58,635 --> 00:35:59,349
Speaker 1: It's super fun.

744
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,043
Speaker 0: So, there's this board game called Flashpoint.

745
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:03,210
Speaker 0: It's about firefighters.

746
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,510
Speaker 0: I saw it on the shelf at a game store, and I said, "Whoa, board game about firefighting?

747
00:36:07,911 --> 00:36:09,399
Speaker 0: That looks like an awesome theme.

748
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,189
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's any good, but that theme looks

749
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:11,430
Speaker 0: sweet.".

750
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,450
Speaker 0: And there was expansions that had shit like a fire dog, like a little plastic fire dog.

751
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,570
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Whoa, even if this game is garbage, that looks fun just to play with those pieces.

752
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:21,278
Speaker 0: What is this

753
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:21,603
Speaker 0: about?".

754
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:23,481
Speaker 0: Well, I got to play it.

755
00:36:23,823 --> 00:36:24,508
Speaker 0: And you know what it is?

756
00:36:25,312 --> 00:36:26,055
Speaker 0: It's Pandemic.

757
00:36:26,276 --> 00:36:31,517
Speaker 0: It's a co-op game where the board is trying to beat you, basically, and you all work together.

758
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:34,030
Speaker 0: You're one firefighter each to put out the fire.

759
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,830
Speaker 1: But, Scott, I thought co-op games all sucked unless they're Hanabi.

760
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:42,850
Speaker 0: Well, this game is not as good as Hanabi as far as co-op games go, because it is basically Pandemic, right?

761
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,010
Speaker 0: The thing is, compared to Pandemic, this is better.

762
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:53,810
Speaker 0: And, of course, somebody could still sort of quarterback this game and sort of play solitaire.

763
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:59,549
Speaker 0: You could actually play solitaire or tell everyone what to do and have those problems, right?

764
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:06,270
Speaker 0: But, for some reason, just the design of it and the fact that it's open, right?

765
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:10,470
Speaker 0: See, in Pandemic, you've sort of got these hidden cards, right?

766
00:37:11,111 --> 00:37:16,570
Speaker 0: And the problem with Pandemic is it's vague what you can tell other people, right?

767
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,650
Speaker 0: And so you're sort of forced to make your own decision, right?

768
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,082
Speaker 0: What to do on your turn with your hidden information.

769
00:37:23,162 --> 00:37:24,669
Speaker 0: That's sort of what makes it co-op.

770
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:28,907
Speaker 0: In Hanabi, you literally can't tell people what you have because you don't know.

771
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:29,530
Speaker 0: They all do.

772
00:37:30,434 --> 00:37:31,669
Speaker 0: And that fixes that problem.

773
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,720
Speaker 0: Flashpoint goes in the other direction.

774
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:36,390
Speaker 0: You don't have hidden information.

775
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,575
Speaker 0: Everything is public.

776
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:39,344
Speaker 0: There's no hidden hand of cards or anything.

777
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,390
Speaker 0: Everyone sees everything.

778
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:47,450
Speaker 0: So what ends up happening is, rather than quarterbacking, you simply all discuss together what to do with everyone's turn, right?

779
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:54,070
Speaker 0: But you control your firefighter in the end, but no one really does anything dumb or whatever.

780
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:55,818
Speaker 0: You have a lot of options.

781
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:58,089
Speaker 0: There's so many fun things the firefighters do.

782
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,894
Speaker 1: Ah, you fools!

783
00:37:59,055 --> 00:38:01,230
Speaker 1: I was on the side of the fire all along.

784
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:01,671
Speaker 0: Right.

785
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:03,178
Speaker 0: There's no traitors either.

786
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,850
Speaker 0: Everyone is trying to fight the fire.

787
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,983
Speaker 0: And, basically, you're not even really trying to fight the fire.

788
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:08,990
Speaker 0: That's secondary.

789
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,930
Speaker 0: Your main goal is to rescue people from the burning building.

790
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:17,230
Speaker 0: When you rescue a certain number of people, then you've won, as long as the building hasn't collapsed yet.

791
00:38:17,391 --> 00:38:19,090
Speaker 0: On top of your heads, right?

792
00:38:20,213 --> 00:38:23,250
Speaker 0: So, it solves that pandemic problem in that way, right?

793
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:33,290
Speaker 0: Two, it scales to any number of players perfectly, because what happens is pretty much you take a turn doing whatever you do, and then you roll for the fire.

794
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:36,070
Speaker 0: And the next player takes a turn, and you roll for the fire.

795
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:39,750
Speaker 0: So it's pretty much one player's turn, one fire turn, back and forth.

796
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:43,310
Speaker 0: So if you have six players, you get six turns and six fire turns.

797
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,566
Speaker 0: If you have one player, you have one turn, one fire, it perfectly balances out no matter what.

798
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:48,469
Speaker 0: You don't have to think about it.

799
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:57,590
Speaker 0: What makes the game the most fun is just the wide variety of shit you can do, right, to fight the fire, and the wide variety of things that can happen.

800
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:03,650
Speaker 0: It's almost like it's not Dwarf Fortress level, obviously, but there's so much stuff you can do, right?

801
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:09,430
Speaker 0: Obviously, you can walk around, you can put out fire, you can put out smoke, right?

802
00:39:10,072 --> 00:39:14,770
Speaker 0: You can axe walls down to walk through them if you need to, right?

803
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,629
Speaker 1: Does that count as damage?

804
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,276
Speaker 1: Yes.

805
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:20,110
Speaker 0: The fire also damages the walls to bring the, right?

806
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:31,049
Speaker 0: You can open doors, close doors, you can go inspect the points of interest to see if there are people who need being rescued, or if they're nothing, and you wasted your time walking over there.

807
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:39,710
Speaker 0: There are hazmats in the buildings, you can pick them up and carry them around and throw them out, or they might get exploded, which is bad.

808
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:47,370
Speaker 0: You can go outside and drive the ambulance around to get it closer to where the people you're rescuing are.

809
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:54,190
Speaker 0: You can go outside and drive the fire engine around, then you can use the deck gun on the fire engine to spray, right, and try to put out fire.

810
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:58,730
Speaker 1: I feel like that is the board game equivalent of having one of those mounted machine guns in Half-Life 1.

811
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:06,490
Speaker 0: It only works on one quadrant of the house, so when fires are in the middle of the house, it doesn't work too well, but if a fire is in a corner of the house, the deck gun works great.

812
00:40:07,191 --> 00:40:11,562
Speaker 0: But there's a random element to it, so when I used it, I missed a bunch of fire.

813
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:14,490
Speaker 0: It could have been much more effective had I rolled more conveniently.

814
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:22,030
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's just this ridiculous amount of fun fire-fighty stuff you can do, and the expansions give you more maps, more rules.

815
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:25,999
Speaker 0: The fire dog, he can rescue people really well because he's a fire dog.

816
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:30,710
Speaker 0: He can just grab unconscious people and drag them out of the house, but he can't fight fire because he's just a dog.

817
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:32,670
Speaker 1: Racist?

818
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,593
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

819
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:34,974
Speaker 0: Racist.

820
00:40:35,857 --> 00:40:36,418
Speaker 0: Speicist.

821
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:37,180
Speaker 0: Speicist.

822
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,023
Speaker 0: Anti-dog.

823
00:40:38,123 --> 00:40:38,805
Speaker 0: No, I'm pro-dog.

824
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:39,788
Speaker 0: The dog is awesome, actually.

825
00:40:39,808 --> 00:40:40,269
Speaker 0: It's really helpful.

826
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,830
Speaker 1: Positive stereotypes are just as bad as negative stereotypes.

827
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,371
Speaker 0: Fine.

828
00:40:45,391 --> 00:40:45,954
Speaker 0: Fuck you, dog.

829
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:47,341
Speaker 0: You suck.

830
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:48,205
Speaker 0: Get out of here.

831
00:40:48,225 --> 00:40:49,190
Speaker 0: Humans are going to fight this fire.

832
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,503
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like it solves several of the problems of co-op games.

833
00:40:52,523 --> 00:40:54,270
Speaker 1: It's not perfect, but it sounds super fun.

834
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, it's just way fun.

835
00:40:56,235 --> 00:40:59,543
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of different classes.

836
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:02,010
Speaker 0: Every firefighter is a different class, right?

837
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,480
Speaker 0: So there's the generalist, who just does a bunch of action points.

838
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:08,790
Speaker 0: The game is action-point based, so the generalist has six action points.

839
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:14,790
Speaker 0: And it's like one action point to move orthogonally, one space, two action points to put out a fire square, right?

840
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:21,064
Speaker 0: So two action points to drag someone, two action points to drag a hazmat, et cetera, et cetera.

841
00:41:21,084 --> 00:41:23,230
Speaker 0: There's a whole list of crazy things you can do, right?

842
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,235
Speaker 0: This many action points to use the deck gun.

843
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:31,010
Speaker 0: This many action points to drive a vehicle, but if someone else is in the vehicle, when you drive it, they move for free, right?

844
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,937
Speaker 0: This many action points to chop down the wall.

845
00:41:34,262 --> 00:41:36,149
Speaker 0: The generalist gets more action points and that's it.

846
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:40,820
Speaker 0: Other characters get, basically, they have less overall action points.

847
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,990
Speaker 0: they can use for anything, but they'll have specialties in particular areas.

848
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,499
Speaker 0: Like there's a guy, he's just really good at putting out fire, you know?

849
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:52,650
Speaker 0: There's another guy, just really good at rescuing people, right?

850
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,675
Speaker 0: If he's carrying people, moves way faster.

851
00:41:54,695 --> 00:42:00,830
Speaker 0: There's someone else, just really good at moving, but not really good at the other stuff, like they're shitty at the other stuff, right?

852
00:42:01,272 --> 00:42:05,270
Speaker 0: So you sort of have to look at, you know, what kind of house you're working with, right?

853
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:16,070
Speaker 0: The main game comes with two boards, one on each side, and there's like at least two or three more expansion boards that have multiple stories, and shit gets crazy, like the stories can collapse on each other and stuff.

854
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:28,490
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you're looking for some co-op action, and, you know, pandemic is problematic, and the people you're with, Hanabi's maybe too hard or too small, you're looking for something that takes a little longer than Hanabi.

855
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:35,009
Speaker 1: And I guess if you want that, like, the fun, you don't have that sort of yelling, "Oh my god, you gotta go over there right

856
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:35,209
Speaker 1: now!"

857
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:35,410
Speaker 1: feeling.

858
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:42,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not as brutal as paranoia, not paranoia, pandemic, and trying to kill you.

859
00:42:42,484 --> 00:42:45,350
Speaker 0: It's not easy, but it's not brutally hard, right?

860
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:52,130
Speaker 0: We were able to come up with a strategy where basically we made a doorway, and when there wasn't a doorway that was convenient, we made one with our axe.

861
00:42:53,210 --> 00:43:10,690
Speaker 0: And then we put out all the fire, basically leading to the area where the rescue people were, and we funneled them out through this one sort of safe channel, and we let the rest of the house burn, and we managed to get lucky and rescue everyone before the house entirely burned down, and then we were good.

862
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,854
Speaker 0: So there's strategies to this, right?

863
00:43:12,894 --> 00:43:19,370
Speaker 0: And you sort of, we needed to work together to make this strategy happen, and sort of everyone does what they want, then the game will not go so well.

864
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:24,670
Speaker 1: Now I guess what we need to do is play both of those SNES firefighting games and see how similar they are.

865
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,230
Speaker 0: There's an SNES firefighting game?

866
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:26,769
Speaker 1: There's two of them.

867
00:43:26,892 --> 00:43:27,388
Speaker 0: How does it work?

868
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:30,290
Speaker 1: Kind of like Flashpoint, actually.

869
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:30,813
Speaker 0: Yeah?

870
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:31,467
Speaker 0: Time-based?

871
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,139
Speaker 1: Well, they're real-time, but they're kind of, you know what they look like?

872
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,727
Speaker 1: They both kind of look like Zombies.

873
00:43:37,768 --> 00:43:38,470
Speaker 1: Ate My Neighbors.

874
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:40,849
Speaker 0: Flashpoint kind of looks like that, yeah.

875
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:41,229
Speaker 1: Exactly.

876
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,450
Speaker 0: Top-down house view.

877
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,319
Speaker 1: I tried streaming one of them a while ago.

878
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,010
Speaker 1: I promised I'd stream the other one in more detail.

879
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:47,433
Speaker 0: Oh, well, yeah.

880
00:43:47,813 --> 00:43:57,170
Speaker 0: I mean, if you like firefighting as a theme, like, this makes you feel like you are firefighting, like, the craziest fire that real firemen would never even fight.

881
00:43:57,891 --> 00:44:00,380
Speaker 0: And in that aspect, this game feels amazing.

882
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,170
Speaker 0: So if you like firefighting as a theme, get this game immediately.

883
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:12,050
Speaker 0: If you like co-op games, and you don't have someone who's a jerk with you who's gonna, like, take over, then also get this game.

884
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:17,050
Speaker 0: If you're tired of Pandemic, but you liked it before, but you're just tired of it, get this game.

885
00:44:18,971 --> 00:44:26,010
Speaker 0: If you don't really like co-op games, or your friends are sucky, or you don't like firefighting, don't get this game.

886
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:30,570
Speaker 1: I feel bad for you if your friends are so sucky that they couldn't even play this kind of co-op game.

887
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:30,830
Speaker 1: Sure.

888
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:39,330
Speaker 0: Another thing is that, you know, I think the one flaw in the game is that if you play with the same people on the same maps, it's gonna get old kind of fast.

889
00:44:39,651 --> 00:44:42,804
Speaker 0: You really kind of do need the expansions to keep the replay value up.

890
00:44:42,824 --> 00:44:44,390
Speaker 0: You need to keep mixing it up, right?

891
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:50,530
Speaker 0: There's different difficulty levels at least, so you can crank it up to be harder, and you can try different maps and things.

892
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:58,490
Speaker 0: But, yeah, after you've played it a few times, if you just get the one box and that's it, I don't know how many times you can play it and still be interested.

893
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,036
Speaker 0: You'll need to buy an expansion.

894
00:45:00,437 --> 00:45:02,465
Speaker 0: But there are a bunch of them, and they seem to keep coming out.

895
00:45:02,505 --> 00:45:03,930
Speaker 0: I guess it's not unpopular.

896
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:08,249
Speaker 0: I've been seeing it around a lot lately, so keep an eye on this.

897
00:45:10,091 --> 00:45:11,916
Speaker 1: Alright, so stay tuned.

898
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:16,230
Speaker 1: We'll tweet out when we actually start streaming stuff for Geek Nights Tuesdays.

899
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe you should follow us on Twitter and whatnot.

900
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, follow us on all the stuff.

901
00:45:19,936 --> 00:45:23,150
Speaker 1: On Twitter, actually follow us both on Twitch.

902
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,029
