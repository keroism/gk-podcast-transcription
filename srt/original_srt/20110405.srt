17
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:10,604
Speaker 1: No.

18
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:12,130
Speaker 1: It's just a gigantic tall ceiling.

19
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,718
Speaker 0: Oh, it always had a pretty tall ceiling.

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,044
Speaker 1: It's way taller.

21
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:21,550
Speaker 1: think twice as tall 20% cooler, but I got to have some de bella's and you know what it's kind of like rewatching Ava every time.

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,520
Speaker 1: I think you know what that gay.

23
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,492
Speaker 1: that wasn't as good as What.

24
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:26,181
Speaker 0: are you stupid or like when?

25
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:27,690
Speaker 1: I would you know not that long ago?

26
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,589
Speaker 1: I was like playing Zelda 1 again, and I remembered oh wait one of the best games ever.

27
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,274
Speaker 0: You just don't learn your lesson.

28
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:33,535
Speaker 0: Dude.

29
00:01:34,017 --> 00:01:36,165
Speaker 1: Yeah, de bella's pretty much has the best subs in the world.

30
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:43,882
Speaker 1: I Don't know about the world Best subs I have ever had short of occasional one-off subs.

31
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:45,306
Speaker 1: Yeah made by experts.

32
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:45,948
Speaker 0: That's right.

33
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:55,110
Speaker 1: I mean but on the way back, uh Feel a little ooky not from de bella's because I shared de bella's with many other people who did not get sick.

34
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:56,435
Speaker 0: Maybe it was.

35
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:58,869
Speaker 0: was there an ingredient in your de bella's that was not in it?

36
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:03,210
Speaker 1: Exact same de bella made by the same person that someone else had and they were fine.

37
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:07,245
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and Emily had a different de bella that someone else also had.

38
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:11,302
Speaker 1: neither one of them got sick All right, so I yeah horrible food poison.

39
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:12,809
Speaker 0: What did you eat before the de bella?

40
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,981
Speaker 1: Uh a whole bunch of different things.

41
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:16,329
Speaker 1: I can't really.

42
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:20,827
Speaker 1: Maybe it was the raw sprouts mixed with uncooked eggs.

43
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:21,329
Speaker 0: That's it?

44
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:23,235
Speaker 0: I don't know.

45
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:24,141
Speaker 0: That's the one.

46
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:28,430
Speaker 1: but yeah Horrible food poisoning didn't go to work yesterday.

47
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:39,870
Speaker 1: the best part of this is I like rock climb and Ski and bike and rollerblade and I do all this stuff and I'm trying to learn parkour and I'm kind of an active guy.

48
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:47,319
Speaker 1: You'd think when I injure myself the inevitable day when I seriously injure myself It will be because I was doing something dangerous.

49
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:53,741
Speaker 1: No, in fact, I threw my back out so bad I couldn't walk on Sunday in the course of vomiting.

50
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:57,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, I vomited so violently I threw out my back.

51
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:58,239
Speaker 0: that'll happen.

52
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:03,418
Speaker 1: The worst part is and think about this I vomit in the course of vomiting.

53
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:04,300
Speaker 1: I throw out my back.

54
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,610
Speaker 1: I fall over backwards and proceed to continue vomiting.

55
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:11,537
Speaker 1: That was that was my lowest moment There.

56
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:13,290
Speaker 1: there is very much a little lower than that.

57
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:21,830
Speaker 1: He didn't suffocate on the vomit because at least the last time I got horrible food poisoning I was hospitalized before I fell over backwards vomiting.

58
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:24,496
Speaker 0: You seem to have a trend here.

59
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,105
Speaker 1: my body's first my go-to thing.

60
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,151
Speaker 1: if there's any trouble my body's like What do we do?

61
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:29,713
Speaker 1: vomit?

62
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,623
Speaker 0: I'll resist bargaining until the end of days.

63
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:33,345
Speaker 1: I will too.

64
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:34,790
Speaker 1: My body has other ideas.

65
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,257
Speaker 1: It's expert system is like is there a problem?

66
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,343
Speaker 1: Can this be solved by vomiting vomit?

67
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:41,670
Speaker 0: Anyway, my streak is now very long.

68
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:51,770
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that was awesome man, I missed work good job and today I feel great But I think that's because I ate solid food for the first time in two days.

69
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:52,814
Speaker 0: That's a good thing.

70
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:53,496
Speaker 1: Yeah.

71
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,444
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's all also.

72
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:57,130
Speaker 1: no fucking my little pony on Friday.

73
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:59,285
Speaker 0: No, maybe this Friday.

74
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:04,042
Speaker 1: It better be There better be I don't know I don't know what I'll do.

75
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:05,650
Speaker 1: send an angry letter to Hasbro.

76
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,573
Speaker 1: I've already talked to them.

77
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:08,561
Speaker 1: They have no interest in.

78
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:10,969
Speaker 0: it says here a bird in the hoof April 8th.

79
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:16,096
Speaker 1: Now I wonder is Celestia Purposefully neglecting her bird?

80
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,890
Speaker 0: or is she angry that they intervene such that they have to cover Tries to help the princess sick bird without her permission and the ponies help smooth it over?

81
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, smooth it over.

82
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:24,195
Speaker 1: that.

83
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:28,070
Speaker 1: that implies that Celestia might not be a hundred percent on the up-and-up.

84
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:31,690
Speaker 0: I think it's one of those situations where she doesn't mind that she helped the bird.

85
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,190
Speaker 0: It's that she broke some other rule in the course of helping the bird like going into a forbidden area.

86
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:39,347
Speaker 1: Ah, you know the forbidden gulag where Luna's locked up.

87
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:47,086
Speaker 1: Yes anyway, so Because I had food poisoning and I couldn't even lie down because I also hurt my back.

88
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:50,509
Speaker 1: I Sat on the couch poking to my xbox all day.

89
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,859
Speaker 1: So I bought shadow complex and played a whole bunch of it.

90
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:53,723
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

91
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:59,627
Speaker 1: Like you said it's kind of But it's not long enough now, which is fine because I don't have the patience.

92
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:03,430
Speaker 0: if it was longer I would have had the patience for if it was longer.

93
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,290
Speaker 0: But I don't have the patience to play the same game to get a hundred percent completion in the same areas over and over again.

94
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:12,583
Speaker 1: I think it's more that I have more patience for a very long game like that.

95
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:17,190
Speaker 1: if it's not a portable like Castlevania I'll pretty much play that forever.

96
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,670
Speaker 1: I could have play an infinite Castlevania and never get bored with it because I can play it like on the subway.

97
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,642
Speaker 1: But if I'm at home, I have so many more things I can do that.

98
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:39,746
Speaker 1: I really don't have patience for Metroidvania Mm-hmm, but I also noticed that the demo for the new Russian attack was there so I played that all the way through and There is not nearly enough rushing Coupled with the fact that the attacking is not so fun.

99
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:44,346
Speaker 1: Really It's basically a shitty version of casual castle crashers with no 3d.

100
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:44,949
Speaker 1: It's just 2d.

101
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:48,529
Speaker 1: So you walk up to a guy and it's like heavy attack light attack block.

102
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:53,185
Speaker 0: But the original Russian attack people don't know that game, but that was like some great game.

103
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:54,630
Speaker 0: You just you couldn't stop rushing.

104
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:55,533
Speaker 0: It's just rush.

105
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:59,225
Speaker 0: and it was constant attacking and if you didn't constantly attack there was dying.

106
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:00,749
Speaker 0: Yeah a lot of it.

107
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:04,284
Speaker 1: For me that game was basically rushing to the game genie.

108
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:06,596
Speaker 1: I Never beat it legit.

109
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,446
Speaker 1: I never even got close to beating it legit.

110
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:09,069
Speaker 1: Fuck that game.

111
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,216
Speaker 1: But Russian attack.

112
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:15,668
Speaker 1: expatriate tried to make a plot like a for serious plot.

113
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:17,513
Speaker 0: That is basically Why do you need a plot?

114
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:17,994
Speaker 0: Here's the plot.

115
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:18,375
Speaker 0: you ready?

116
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:19,599
Speaker 1: Go go go.

117
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,604
Speaker 1: Russian attack the Russians.

118
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:22,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the game.

119
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:27,613
Speaker 1: go go go No, but basically there's no Go.

120
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:29,137
Speaker 1: so tell me if you see.

121
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:30,722
Speaker 1: tell me if you've heard this plot.

122
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:35,356
Speaker 1: before a meteor strikes somewhere in Russia It causes a crystal to grow.

123
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,123
Speaker 1: that crystal is mad energy.

124
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:38,327
Speaker 1: the Russians harvest it.

125
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've heard that.

126
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:41,157
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the plot.

127
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:46,640
Speaker 1: All right, and then I'm in a prison and there's all this dialogue I just don't care about.

128
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:48,190
Speaker 1: and then they let me out of the prison.

129
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,314
Speaker 0: Why is there dialogue?

130
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:52,344
Speaker 0: the game should consist of nothing but rushing and also attack.

131
00:06:52,424 --> 00:07:02,823
Speaker 1: so I stab motherfuckers ending No, stopping no walking and in the course of stabbing motherfuckers I have two choices at all junctures stealth or not stealth.

132
00:07:02,884 --> 00:07:03,746
Speaker 0: Why is there stealth?

133
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:05,454
Speaker 0: It's not hide and attack It's rush.

134
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:08,150
Speaker 1: The game is pretty much like yeah, you want to hide everywhere.

135
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:13,250
Speaker 1: We're gonna give you like a thousand different hide buttons and only to stab motherfucker buttons.

136
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:14,140
Speaker 0: What the fuck.

137
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,970
Speaker 0: who made this game?

138
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,952
Speaker 0: I found a grenade.

139
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:20,430
Speaker 0: really someone just took the name Russian attack and made some other game that was not Russian.

140
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:20,651
Speaker 0: It's a.

141
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:26,110
Speaker 1: they really focused on Russians as in the nationality as opposed to like that, but it's not Russian.

142
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,853
Speaker 0: Are you SS?

143
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:27,576
Speaker 0: I a N?

145
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,841
Speaker 0: Because it's.

146
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:29,825
Speaker 0: are you SS?

147
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:30,006

Speaker 0: I'm an American soldier in a gulag Stabbing motherfuckers in Russia as in rush and like, you know toys are us.

152
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,970
Speaker 0: is his rush and attack?

153
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:46,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, you really don't run a rush because then you get caught by bad guys.

154
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,969
Speaker 1: You really want to crouch down and sneak and hide in the hole.

155
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:54,647
Speaker 1: If you want to hide in the door you hit up but if you want to hide in the hole you hit.

156
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:55,249
Speaker 1: why?

157
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,150
Speaker 0: yeah I'm not playing this now.

158
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,496
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah health packs - but you know what?

159
00:07:57,516 --> 00:08:00,730
Speaker 1: I will play packs that you have to use explicitly within d-pad.

160
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:02,135
Speaker 0: You know what though?

161
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:08,590
Speaker 1: I got every night vision that basically you turn it on when you need it and you turn it off When you don't need it, and it doesn't do anything interesting.

162
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:13,890
Speaker 0: I got ROMs of every NES Gameboy and Gameboy color game ever on my DS piracy card.

163
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,629
Speaker 1: I should really get a DS piracy car and now I can play Russian attack.

164
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:21,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, I am so not impressed with Russian attack.

165
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,973
Speaker 1: expatriate that I. it's difficult to describe to you how Uncomfortably bad it would.

166
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:28,916
Speaker 1: not bad not bad.

167
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,863
Speaker 1: if it was bad it would be more fun.

168
00:08:30,883 --> 00:08:33,049
Speaker 1: It's just so desperately mediocre.

169
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:39,929
Speaker 1: To quote Wikipedia players will be able to perform shank combos in addition to the stealth kills.

170
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:42,335
Speaker 0: Why the stealth kills?

171
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:43,960
Speaker 1: the game is all about shanking.

172
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,070
Speaker 1: you realize you just have a knife and you have like a thousand ways.

173
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,710
Speaker 0: But in Russian attack didn't you have like a rocket launchers and machine guns and all sorts of ridiculous.

174
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,830
Speaker 1: Well until you run out of ammo and then it's knives till the end.

175
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,788
Speaker 0: I know that but I'm saying there were rocket launchers and machine guns available to you.

176
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:01,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, so screw this game All right.

177
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,200
Speaker 1: Just if you want a game like this play Bionic Commando rearmed.

178
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,670
Speaker 1: if you didn't that game is why everything you want.

179
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,212
Speaker 0: I get it better.

180
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:07,353
Speaker 0: Do you?

181
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:09,862
Speaker 0: why don't you play Russian attack for the NES?

182
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:11,850
Speaker 1: Why don't you play Bionic Commando for the NES?

183
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:15,045
Speaker 0: I played some bad commander for the Gameboy.

184
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:15,709
Speaker 0: Let me tell you.

185
00:09:18,473 --> 00:09:19,241
Speaker 1: So what do you got for me?

186
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:22,283
Speaker 0: so You know Jane McGonagall right.

187
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:23,010
Speaker 0: she did the keynote.

188
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:24,033
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, she did.

189
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:25,518
Speaker 0: she made this game.

190
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,227
Speaker 0: And if you're in New York, you can play this game bark ball.

191
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:30,153
Speaker 1: No Chicken bowling.

192
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:36,290
Speaker 0: No, it's called find the future and you play it at the library the New York Public Library the big one.

193
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:38,570
Speaker 1: Do I research science and try to better the world?

194
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:44,007
Speaker 0: I don't know what the hell you do but you basically go to the library and you go to this website and you you do whatever it says.

195
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,334
Speaker 0: and then 500 people.

196
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:57,590
Speaker 0: on May 20th 2011 Which is in 44 days 9 hours 23 minutes and some seconds from now at the time of this recording Smart listeners you can figure out exactly when we recorded gig nights.

197
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:06,189
Speaker 0: 500 people Are gonna stay overnight at the Stephen a Schwartzman building and become the first in the world to play a new game.

198
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,136
Speaker 0: Find the future.

199
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:10,043
Speaker 1: Oh, wait a minute New York Public Library.

200
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:12,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, I work right next to that I know.

201
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:16,970
Speaker 0: so if you have to go to the library and You know do this play the game.

202
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,933
Speaker 0: That's on the website.

203
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:27,439
Speaker 0: submit your entry and then 500 people who enter are gonna play the game again the real game I guess on May 20th, okay Overnight at the library.

204
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,310
Speaker 1: I'm spending my lunch over there to tomorrow.

205
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,129
Speaker 0: Yes, this is looking pretty good to me.

206
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

207
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:41,237
Speaker 1: also as a random aside if you weren't at PAX or if you were stupid didn't go to the keynote I'll try to find a link to it.

208
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:43,649
Speaker 1: You should be able to find her keynote from PAX.

209
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,670
Speaker 1: It was pretty damn amazing.

210
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,232
Speaker 0: You had a lot of crossover with her TED talk though If you've seen that it did but in her book if you've read that but it was obvious a lot of the people in the audience Had not.

211
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:57,288
Speaker 1: what scares me is how many people at our panels did not go to the keynote.

212
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,250
Speaker 1: Yeah Despite the fact that there was a simulcast.

213
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,630
Speaker 1: So while the keynote filled up like you couldn't get in as far as I can tell there was plenty of space in the figure.

214
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:09,805
Speaker 0: Anyone who was there that wasn't at the keynote was one of those expo hall type of people.

215
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:13,140
Speaker 0: or they had some other Conflicting panel that they cared more about.

216
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,185
Speaker 0: so they were not, you know, or they were playing games So they weren't likely to watch a simulcast.

217
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:30,520
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, anyway, so things of the day it turns out now.

218
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:33,087
Speaker 1: I didn't read the study behind this.

219
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:38,280
Speaker 1: I am quoting an article that is talking about an article from the Journal of experimental social psychology.

220
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:54,820
Speaker 1: but supposedly there is evidence that if you are thinking about Being high as in physically higher than some arbitrary reference point You are more likely to cooperate and be altruistic in general.

221
00:11:55,362 --> 00:12:08,642
Speaker 1: So if you put say a Salvation Army bin at the top of an escalator or stairway people are 50% more likely to give than if you put it at the bottom of an escalator or elevator or stairs or ramp or Anything.

222
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:14,080
Speaker 1: it even applies to showing people a video of flying versus a video of walking or driving.

223
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:14,862
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

224
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:20,300
Speaker 1: I bring this up on a Tuesday because one of the panels we did at PAX was game mechanics and mechanism design.

225
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,020
Speaker 1: You know the whole idea that you can design a game that will cause certain behaviors in the play.

226
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,260
Speaker 0: You should put the in-game charity bucket at the top of the in-game escalator.

227
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,600
Speaker 1: No, you should have a picture of the sky at the end of your demo with a button that says buy the game.

228
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:40,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get people go up the stairs at the end of the game before you give them the part You know the buy full version button.

229
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,349
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

230
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:44,360
Speaker 1: There appears to be evidence that that would probably work.

231
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,400
Speaker 0: Probably so I make sure there's birds going.

232
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:50,550
Speaker 1: Now think about this for everything cookie Brigade.

233
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,200
Speaker 1: You got to be at the top of every one of those escalators.

234
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,589
Speaker 0: Just well, I mean the cookie braid already sells all the cookies.

235
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:59,116
Speaker 1: true true, but they could possibly get more money.

236
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:06,640
Speaker 1: Oh If you need a player to play diplomacy with you get them into the game at the top of an escalator.

237
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:08,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, you should be looking for game.

238
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,840
Speaker 0: People should be at the top of escalators and stairs being like one play one play one play.

239
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,326
Speaker 1: I wonder if we can apply this.

240
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:17,100
Speaker 1: we're thinking about doing a show on it because you know out there your German board game players.

241
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:22,592
Speaker 1: There's the problem where nobody wants to play a wooden cube game Until they play it and then they love it.

242
00:13:22,612 --> 00:13:27,440
Speaker 1: I Feel like we need to use this like shit like walk up to someone show them a picture of an airplane.

243
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,418
Speaker 1: They'd be like do you want to play a wooden cube game?

244
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:38,359
Speaker 0: Maybe we should just try wooden cube games that have themes of sky and airplanes and such while playing that song sky-high from dance dance revolution.

245
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,217
Speaker 1: Maybe this is why we like Rainbow Dash so much, too.

246
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:56,767
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I thought this was cool and you know It's kind of a reminder that psychology and game mechanics and mechanism design and games are all Pretty much cut from the same cloth.

247
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:01,643
Speaker 1: The only difference is that mechanism design uses a lot more math All right.

248
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:04,675
Speaker 0: So have you ever heard of a person named Peter Edkison?

249
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:09,370
Speaker 1: Uh My brain says yes, but yeah, he's an important person.

250
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,940
Speaker 0: He was the founder and first CEO of wizards of the coast.

251
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:18,375
Speaker 0: he's also currently the president Gen Con or the owner of Gen Con.

252
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:28,140
Speaker 0: CEO and owner of Gen Con and He you know, he was responsible for uniting D&D and Magic the Gathering under Wizards of the Coast and selling it to Hasbro.

253
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:39,300
Speaker 1: so remember back in the day all the conspiracy people who were like Wizards of the Coast is gonna turn D&D into Magic the Gathering and ruin it But anyway little did they know they would turn it into World of Warcraft.

254
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,453
Speaker 0: He's currently the CEO of hidden city games where they make the Bellis era.

255
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:44,320
Speaker 0: I remember where Luke and Jared were.

256
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,077
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, who would want to play a game about horses on anyway anyway?

257
00:14:49,722 --> 00:15:01,193
Speaker 0: But here is a very interesting interview with this man where he discusses many things such as purchasing Hasbro and Regretting losing the Pokemon card game license and such-and-such using Hasbro.

258
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,219
Speaker 1: You mean being purchased by Hasbro, right?

259
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,660
Speaker 0: exactly?

260
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:05,424
Speaker 0: There was.

261
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:06,810
Speaker 0: there is an interesting.

262
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,360
Speaker 0: I'm gonna give you just one question and answer here.

263
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:10,470
Speaker 0: That's in the middle of the interview.

264
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,520
Speaker 0: that makes it kind of funny, right?

265
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:19,895
Speaker 0: Someone says define fantasy in 25 words or less that the interviewer said that That question has been asked of many people before.

266
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:30,539
Speaker 0: so he says I looked at fantasy for entertaining stories about heroes their beliefs how those beliefs are challenged and dealt with And how that changes the hero.

267
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:36,087
Speaker 1: There's might be a role-playing system he might enjoy.

268
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:38,352
Speaker 0: perhaps perhaps he has heard of it.

269
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:41,300
Speaker 0: perhaps perhaps he employed the creator.

270
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:44,203
Speaker 0: You Should.

271
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:49,339
Speaker 0: I is a good interview worth reading if you are someone who cares about tabletop things.

272
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:55,394
Speaker 0: He also even mentions here the best thing Hasbro has done in the last 10 years.

273
00:15:55,855 --> 00:16:02,774
Speaker 0: big IMO caveat here Is the joint venture with discovery kids to create its own hub children's television channel.

274
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:06,796
Speaker 0: if Hasbro and Wizards can figure out how to leverage The hub together, that would be awesome.

275
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:09,212
Speaker 0: You know what I.

276
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:15,440
Speaker 1: In case anyone is unaware out there, you know new listeners, maybe they don't listen to the other shows.

277
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:23,805
Speaker 0: If they this is a man, this is a man who owns a company that makes a horsey trade card and you try card Trading card game.

278
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:35,737
Speaker 1: if they gave up on the girls and they and they made D&D related shows and just put them on the hub Well D&D comics do real that badly actually I think and they're actually I think it's Paul.

279
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:36,520
Speaker 0: so because they're awful.

280
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:38,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's the problem.

281
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:42,228
Speaker 1: I feel like there's a way to tap that.

282
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:44,400
Speaker 0: but look at how sorry people who make D&D comics.

283
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:47,130
Speaker 0: But if you don't suck you're doing a sucky job.

284
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:53,693
Speaker 1: I have a feeling I mean look at a penny arcade For example at PAX when they did that we're gonna play D&D on stage.

285
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:55,579
Speaker 1: how crazily popular that stuff is.

286
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:59,251
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like you could turn that into a show probably.

287
00:16:59,352 --> 00:16:59,673
Speaker 0: Yeah.

288
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:01,880
Speaker 1: Yeah attack in the darkness and such.

289
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway the meta moment.

290
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:08,099
Speaker 1: we are going to be at anime Boston upcoming in a few weeks doing a whole bunch of panels.

291
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:11,099
Speaker 1: We are going to be at the mocha this weekend.

292
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:15,012
Speaker 1: Yeah, not doing any panels, but we'll be interviewing people our friends.

293
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:15,834
Speaker 1: you going enough.

294
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,135
Speaker 1: Johnny.

295
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:17,339
Speaker 1: Wander will have a table.

296
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,409
Speaker 0: They're having a table.

297
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,076
Speaker 1: Whoa Finally after like five years of us saying they should get a table.

298
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:25,760
Speaker 1: They have a table Oh snap, so you should go find them and pester them.

299
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:27,999
Speaker 1: We should come up with something weird for you to say to them.

300
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:30,692
Speaker 0: Everyone should go up and do the same thing to them.

301
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:31,616
Speaker 0: Like what's the thing?

302
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:37,000
Speaker 0: It has to be something Weird enough to where I gotta get you go to draw ponies as many ponies as possible.

303
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,295
Speaker 1: That's that's self-interested.

304
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:42,487
Speaker 1: All right, guys Your mission is to trick.

305
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:47,420
Speaker 1: you go and enough into drawing pictures of ponies and then scan them in and give them to us.

306
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,639
Speaker 0: We need to you go and on mocha pony collection.

307
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:54,380
Speaker 0: As many my little ponies as you know.

308
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:57,440
Speaker 1: You cannot tell them that we put you up to that.

309
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,538
Speaker 1: Just tell them that you really want them to and that a little bird told you that they were just be like.

310
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:06,074
Speaker 0: just say that You're a huge fan of my little ponies and then you know that.

311
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:09,739
Speaker 0: you know with her art style She would you know that we she would draw an amazing one.

312
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:15,477
Speaker 1: This will also tell us if they listen to gig nights in a timely manner or not.

313
00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:19,330
Speaker 0: I don't think they did Occasionally, I believe they do.

314
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:29,694
Speaker 1: I don't know our friends listen far less than all of you know The book club book which we'll be talking about on Thursday was Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

315
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:31,358

Speaker 1: we submitted our panels for Otacon So we'll see if we're going there.

320
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:02,206
Speaker 1: Pax prime is Five months or so away.

321
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:04,393
Speaker 1: We will be doing panels at it.

322
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:06,620
Speaker 1: There is also I'm going to say a word.

323
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:09,800
Speaker 1: I'm not going to say anything about it because I can't.

324
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:11,384
Speaker 1: Pax dev.

325
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:12,368
Speaker 0: we don't know what that is.

326
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:15,280
Speaker 1: We don't know what that is, but it is something.

327
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,590
Speaker 1: All right, it is something that it might happen someday.

328
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,673
Speaker 0: It might never happen.

329
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:20,214
Speaker 1: Yes.

330
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:22,020
Speaker 0: It's a word that I heard.

331
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,400
Speaker 0: I don't know anything else about the world.

332
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,260
Speaker 1: The word was passed to us some time ago with no further information.

333
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,420
Speaker 0: All right.

334
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:32,928
Speaker 0: So yeah, I'm a. do you say enemy Boston already?

335
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:39,900
Speaker 0: Yes, okay on May 21st and 22nd in New York City There is going to be bar camp.

336
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:44,800
Speaker 0: So the registration information will appear at some point.

337
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:54,420
Speaker 0: But if you go to the bar camp NYC Twitter account There is a link to where you can sign up to be notified of when you'll be able to register.

338
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:58,212
Speaker 0: So do that if you are New York City person you want to go to bar camp.

339
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:00,339
Speaker 0: I'm helping organize it.

340
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,002
Speaker 0: It's gonna be good.

341
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:10,020
Speaker 1: So I enjoyed Street Fighter and RTS's and you know fighting games, but what are the?

342
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:16,497
Speaker 1: Well, they're the same thing basically Just a higher level, but I think they're mostly the same.

343
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:25,111
Speaker 1: They're more Execution matters more than strategy at the low levels in some of the games Yes, and at the high level strategy matters only because execution is perfect.

344
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:25,632
Speaker 1: That's right.

345
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:28,540
Speaker 1: But I am ass at these games.

346
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:36,127
Speaker 1: I am so bad at Street Fighter that despite spending a lot of time Practicing and trying to become good.

347
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:45,620
Speaker 0: I'm trivially dispatched by even what I would consider low ranking players Yeah, I mean there there are games, you know such as jungle speed which are pure execution, right?

348
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:47,448
Speaker 0: No strategy jungle speed.

349
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:49,980
Speaker 1: Well, there is technically the strategy strategy.

350
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,727
Speaker 0: Here's the strategy execute perfectly.

351
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:53,252
Speaker 1: if I match someone else.

352
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,260
Speaker 1: I will grab the totem before they do.

353
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:55,762
Speaker 0: There's no.

354
00:20:55,802 --> 00:20:56,766
Speaker 0: but this there is no.

355
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:58,413
Speaker 0: no one has any different strategies.

356
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,000
Speaker 0: Everyone has the optimal strategy.

357
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:03,752
Speaker 1: I do have a secondary strategy that not everyone has colors.

358
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:04,876
Speaker 1: colors match.

359
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:06,000
Speaker 1: It's a match match.

360
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:09,157
Speaker 0: The point is that a game like jungle speed.

361
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:10,400
Speaker 1: There's no talking in jungle.

362
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:14,735
Speaker 0: Execution is everything and the winner is determined purely by execute.

363
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:20,155
Speaker 1: I mean, I have a strategy in hockey I take the biscuit and I put it in the bed as much as I can.

364
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:21,700
Speaker 0: in other games, right?

365
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,825
Speaker 0: There it strategy dominates right?

366
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,055
Speaker 0: So, you know in diplomacy there pretty much is no execution.

367
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:28,138
Speaker 0: Yeah whatsoever.

368
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:33,700
Speaker 1: It's all Strategy, actually, I would argue that diplomacy is nothing but execution of applied psychology.

369
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:35,284
Speaker 0: Whatever.

370
00:21:35,305 --> 00:21:41,131
Speaker 0: the point is that there it's not you know a sport or Locking the door before Scott Johnson gets back to put in his order.

371
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:41,432
Speaker 1: Sure.

372
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,780
Speaker 0: Whatever right other games, right?

373
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,171
Speaker 0: I have a mixture of the two.

374
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:47,785
Speaker 0: for example football Is the foot?

375
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,660
Speaker 0: is the strategy and the execution mixed together, however?

376
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:56,720
Speaker 0: In some games right where there were even when the two factors are present, right?

377
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,411
Speaker 0: One of the factors has been mastered.

378
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:12,000
Speaker 0: For example, there are many games Where for example baseball there is execution and strategy in baseball But people have mastered the strategy such that only the execution matters at high levels of play.

379
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:15,040
Speaker 0: At low levels of play people still haven't mastered the strategy.

380
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,931
Speaker 0: So both things still matter right but at high levels.

381
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:20,340
Speaker 0: in Major League Baseball only execution really matters.

382
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:24,892
Speaker 0: Right and such in like fighting games like Street Fighter, right?

383
00:22:24,932 --> 00:22:26,677
Speaker 0: There is execution and strategy.

384
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:27,800
Speaker 0: both come into effect.

385
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:36,005
Speaker 0: however at the highest levels Execution has largely been perfected and only the strategy Mostly matters.

386
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:46,479
Speaker 0: at the highest levels right of things like Street Fighter and RTS is right Whereas on the low levels of Street Fighter and RTS is both Execution and strategy matter because neither one of them have been mastered.

387
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:51,870
Speaker 1: now imagine if you took Street Fighter 4, let's say championship edition and Championship edition.

388
00:22:52,031 --> 00:23:01,572
Speaker 1: Yeah super super And made it where execution didn't matter where I input my string of moves and we take turns And you can take as long as you want.

389
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:06,675
Speaker 0: Yep, like alright I'm gonna throw a Hadoken and if you don't tell the guy that before you do it.

390
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:08,536
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if he comes near me I'm gonna hit.

391
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:12,897
Speaker 1: So Yomi is basically that it's Street Fighter.

392
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:13,540
Speaker 1: the card game.

393
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:18,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's made by this guy named Sirlin who has a. he's made he's making a bunch of games.

394
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,160
Speaker 0: now.

395
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,899
Speaker 0: I made this puzzle game with the chips right with something that people are talking about.

396
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,680
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah They were playing that at zinc icon.

397
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:23,861
Speaker 1: yeah,

398
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:35,767
Speaker 0: and basically I kept hearing about this Yomi game and people just kept talking about it and talking about it and then I Saw some people play it once and I noticed that it was also a real deck of cards like, you know Two three four five Jack Queen puzzle

399
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:36,188
Speaker 1: strike.

400
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:37,192
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the other one.

401
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:41,468
Speaker 0: All right, then this guy also has on his website He wrote a book about playing to win the game.

402
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:49,820
Speaker 0: So we like this guy, but this guy Sirlin I think he's also if I'm not mistaken like, you know a master of mechanism design.

403
00:23:50,061 --> 00:24:02,088
Speaker 1: His site shows at the top your shopping bag is empty and there's a sad looking shopping bag looking at you with big eyes like Yep, and if you put something in it, he's happy.

404
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:02,711
Speaker 0: Yep.

405
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:05,420
Speaker 0: Anyway, but anyway, yeah, this guy knows what he's going on.

406
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,695
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure he's like a semi professional fighting game guy, but he's yeah,

407
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:08,896
Speaker 1: well

408
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:27,542
Speaker 0: like us He was always upset that pretty much, you know, he's gonna beat the hell out of us at fighting games, but He still was always bothered by the fact that you know, he couldn't execute You know perfectly along with you know The highest highest level guys, even though he felt that he was strategically on the same level or higher level than them He couldn't beat them.

409
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:37,300
Speaker 1: because execution now that is not a flaw in any game because I am of the mind that Execution and elegance of execution is a very fine form of competition.

410
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:45,100
Speaker 1: I mean, it's fantastic the strategy of hockey whatever but the execution of hitting a guy into the boards as hard as you can without doing A penalty matters to me quite a bit.

411
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:56,407
Speaker 1: I enjoy watching such interplay But there is a place for both and I like the fact that he's considered how to take a game like Street Fighter and bring it down to the low level.

412
00:24:56,447 --> 00:25:00,620
Speaker 1: So someone who does not have the execution abilities can enjoy the high-level strategy.

413
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:08,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, but basically there is a strategy in Street Fighter But you you can't really access that strategy unless you get really really good at the execution.

414
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:13,627
Speaker 0: and not many people can do that Even many even though many people play Street Fighter.

415
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:18,780
Speaker 0: very few people experience the strategy of Street Fighter because it's inaccessible to them.

416
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,100
Speaker 0: They need to be masters of the joystick before they can get there.

417
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,673
Speaker 1: So he's made a game before you can master the joystick.

418
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:27,400
Speaker 1: You must first master yourself.

419
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:37,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, he made a game called Yomi which is a card game which has the exact same or nearly the exact same strategic elements and play as Street Fighter or most fighting games.

420
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,295
Speaker 1: you've got your power.

421
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:41,709
Speaker 1: bar your life Yeah, with none of the execution.

422
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,420
Speaker 0: so it doesn't matter if you can't use a joystick for poop.

423
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:52,020
Speaker 1: You can get the same Street Fighter experience unless you're good at close-up magic and you just cheat with the cards.

424
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,528
Speaker 0: Yes, we're assuming no cheating because I've been practicing.

425
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:58,260
Speaker 1: I think I can fairly effectively reveal a card in either direction.

426
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,682
Speaker 0: We'll just play the digital version Hack it.

427
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:03,770
Speaker 0: There's a real digital version.

428
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,854
Speaker 0: It's official on the website.

429
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:05,757
Speaker 0: It's in beta.

430
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:08,970
Speaker 0: I'll hack it Anyway, so what's Yomi all about?

431
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,420
Speaker 0: so Yomi is a non collectible card game, right?

432
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,782
Speaker 0: Where each deck of there's decks of cards is ten of them and you can buy sets of two or you can buy the full Set.

433
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:18,853
Speaker 0: the full sets really expensive.

434
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:20,000
Speaker 0: It's like a hundred something dollars.

435
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:24,600
Speaker 0: Right, but the individual like, you know to buy just two decks is like 20 something.

436
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:30,703
Speaker 1: my suggestion to distribute the cost and to make sure you like it is do what we did and buy one set of two and play the Game a couple times.

437
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:35,820
Speaker 1: if you're intrigued at all trick one of your idiot friends into buying a set of two different characters.

438
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,111
Speaker 0: No, it's non collectible non customizable.

439
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:39,297
Speaker 0: It's not magically gathering.

440
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:43,800
Speaker 0: It's not yugioh It's not Pokemon, but each individual deck is a different character.

441
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:47,609
Speaker 0: So think of it like, you know This deck is guile and this deck is M bison.

442
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:52,138
Speaker 0: in this deck is Chun Li and originally I'm pretty sure he wanted the street Fighter license, but he couldn't get it.

443
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:59,260
Speaker 0: So he just made up characters and the first set is fantasy strike And I think the next set is gonna be something else, right?

444
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,260
Speaker 0: So each set is gonna be a different, you know setting with different characters.

445
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:06,708
Speaker 0: So when the next set comes out you have you know Ten more characters.

446
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:08,200
Speaker 0: next that comes out your ten more characters.

447
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:12,340
Speaker 1: It has all the aesthetics of a video fight as the stupid plot of a fighting game.

448
00:27:12,842 --> 00:27:14,508
Speaker 1: It has the characters and the backstory.

449
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:15,833
Speaker 1: the characters are all kind of absurd.

450
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:17,680
Speaker 1: It is everything you would expect.

451
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:18,524
Speaker 0: Yep, it is.

452
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:20,394
Speaker 0: It is exactly like a fighting game in every way.

453
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:21,420
Speaker 0: Here's how the game works, right?

454
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,980
Speaker 0: You take your deck of cards, which is also a regular deck of cards, you know, 52 plus 2 jokers, right?

455
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:36,120
Speaker 0: You shuffle it up You draw seven and every turn you play rock-paper-scissors and the rock-paper-scissors is pretty much either attack throw or block dodge.

456
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:42,714
Speaker 0: Right, so block dodge beats attack Attack beats throw and throw beats block and dodge, right?

457
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:45,431
Speaker 1: So you play rock-paper-scissors Kind of like a fighting game.

458
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:50,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like a fighting game and if you win the rock-paper-scissors, then you get to do a bunch of damage possibly.

459
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:55,800
Speaker 0: but First if before you do a combo, right?

460
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,800
Speaker 0: Which is how you would do even more damage the other person gets to bluff.

461
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:06,131
Speaker 0: They can put a card face down and bluff which is like a ha ha Right, and that ha ha ha is pretty much like either.

462
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:10,959
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, you can risk doing a combo But if I'm not bluffing your combos gonna be a waste.

463
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:14,616
Speaker 1: The best part though is that it the dynamics are like a fighting game.

464
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:18,931
Speaker 1: attacks have speed If two if attack hits attack the faster one gets through.

465
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:27,880
Speaker 1: and you have this combo system where if you hit someone once You know, I poke M bison with my jab, I then lay in with the combo into my ender that knocks him down.

466
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:34,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if he was bluffing that combo is just gonna be a big waste and he'll block the rest of the combo even though The first or if I dodge I get to counter.

467
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,360
Speaker 1: but if I block then I get other things.

468
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:42,808
Speaker 0: But but if you block a special attack, you still take a little bit of chip damage Yeah, and some characters they're.

469
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:45,200
Speaker 1: the damage that goes through the block is substantial.

470
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, and every character has different attacks different special abilities, right certain cards.

471
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,854
Speaker 0: You know every card actually has two abilities on it, right so you play.

472
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:57,132
Speaker 1: we pick which way you want it to face And like one sides attack one sides dodge.

473
00:28:57,313 --> 00:28:58,500
Speaker 0: Yep and special attack.

474
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:07,601
Speaker 0: Some of them are the same thing on both sides, but some of them have two different abilities like, you know The fish man, he can either do a bubble shield or you can do like some crazy attack with the other side of the same Card.

475
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:10,473
Speaker 1: it's a complete information game and that you know the full.

476
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:12,080
Speaker 0: No, you don't know what the other part Scott.

477
00:29:12,342 --> 00:29:14,480
Speaker 1: Yes, it's not a perfect information game.

478
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,480
Speaker 1: It is a complete information game because you know the entirety of the strategies available to both characters.

479
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:21,280
Speaker 0: No, cuz you don't know what cards he has in his hand.

480
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,319
Speaker 0: You don't know is a block even possible for him this turn?

481
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:28,076
Speaker 1: But you know the total array of possible strategies and you know.

482
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:34,179
Speaker 0: what you know Is that the certain strategy might be impossible if he does at that time, but it is theoretically possible at any point.

483
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,040
Speaker 1: Theoretically, it's not perfect information.

484
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,689
Speaker 0: Well, you think you'd have to know what's in his hands got.

485
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:46,595
Speaker 1: complete information simply means you basically means that you know The rules of the game and you know the rules both players are playing by.

486
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:48,784
Speaker 0: you do know the rules Perfect information.

487
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:50,493
Speaker 0: you look to the other guy's deck and know all his.

488
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:58,570
Speaker 1: yes means that you know Every decision that has been made up to this point and there are no simultaneous decisions Mm-hmm, and this game is nothing but simultaneous decisions.

489
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,173
Speaker 0: That's right.

490
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:02,785
Speaker 0: And there's also lots of hidden cards and Pretty much that's it.

491
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:06,620
Speaker 1: I mean the characters all have neat powers like Lum the gambling panda.

492
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,420
Speaker 1: It's just like we only have four the characters.

493
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,224
Speaker 0: So I don't know about the other six, you know But the ones we have.

494
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:13,133
Speaker 0: we got the regular people the red and blue this.

495
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:17,029
Speaker 0: they seem to be like the main and we have Lizard man equivalents the weirdo characters.

496
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:17,190
Speaker 1: Yes.

497
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,374
Speaker 0: It's a random panda.

498
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,402
Speaker 0: and the defensive fish man Who is?

499
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:21,772
Speaker 1: I love the defensive fish man.

500
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:22,739
Speaker 0: fish man's pretty good.

501
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,860
Speaker 0: He does two damage every single round no matter what unless he's knocked down.

502
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,045
Speaker 1: My only worry is that we played a whole bunch of times and the blue guy and the first deck you bought is so far Is undefeated by a wide margin?

503
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:36,839
Speaker 0: No, I think the the red girl won once when I played at board game night.

504
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:37,705
Speaker 0: Ah How about that?

505
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:38,210
Speaker 0: All right.

506
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:41,715
Speaker 1: Yeah The blue guy is that one combo that does like 45 damage.

507
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,740
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's one move that does 45 damage, but you need to have three aces, right?

508
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,985
Speaker 0: That's another cool thing about.

509
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:53,760
Speaker 0: the game is like it has all these mechanics that so Perfectly represent mechanics and fighting games, right?

510
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,140
Speaker 0: If you do a combo of regular attacks Then you get to search your deck to get aces which are always your best attack.

511
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:03,540
Speaker 0: You can discard pairs three of a kind and four of a kind to go search for aces.

512
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:12,160
Speaker 0: You can do all these things to go get aces out of your deck and that's basically the equivalent of powering up the EX meter At the bottom of the screen in any fighting game, right, you know.

513
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:19,420
Speaker 0: And that way even though you might have used all your cards already You can go dig for the aces to get you know to get more so you can keep unleashing your best attack.

514
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,720
Speaker 0: You know your ultra your super or whatever, even though you've already used it.

515
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,000
Speaker 1: You also draw aces if you chain together long combos.

516
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:31,520
Speaker 1: I said that already but the bet the big part is that different characters have different limits on combos.

517
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,846
Speaker 1: Like the panda only has four.

518
00:31:32,906 --> 00:31:33,970
Speaker 1: the fish man has three.

519
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:36,280
Speaker 1: one character has like five or six.

520
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:41,835
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that some of the characters, you know Every character has a particular strategy is Valerie has more than anyone.

521
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:46,372
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is Some of the characters right are just pretty from what I hear.

522
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:48,080
Speaker 0: they're just win against other characters.

523
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,379
Speaker 0: You know It's sort of like a rock versus before you even start.

524
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:56,749
Speaker 0: Like if you take the guy who's all about blocking and you take the other guy who's all about getting through blocks Well, guess who's gonna win most of the time?

525
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:56,970
Speaker 1: Yeah.

526
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,453
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

527
00:31:57,473 --> 00:31:58,640
Speaker 1: It's kind of like a fighting game.

528
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is kind of.

529
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:05,297
Speaker 0: you know If you see the other guy chooses a character and you see what character he chooses you can pick a character.

530
00:32:05,338 --> 00:32:09,995
Speaker 1: that's strong against Character but then they'll pick a different character and it's the same problem.

531
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:11,240
Speaker 1: and I wonder what would happen.

532
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:13,297
Speaker 1: It's like a fighting game panda vs.

533
00:32:13,317 --> 00:32:13,660
Speaker 1: Panda.

534
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:17,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you got two decks, I see no reason why you couldn't do that.

535
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:19,168
Speaker 0: You know, you just had to get.

536
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:21,567
Speaker 0: even if you think is you can't even do that You buy the full set.

537
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:23,000
Speaker 0: you did buy two full sets to do that.

538
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:29,579
Speaker 1: That's why I'm saying just everyone who cares about this game If your friends like it is get each one of them to buy one of the sets of two.

539
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:39,180
Speaker 0: Well, if I all go in and buy the box and split it up The box does come with like mats to play on and life counters and that sort of extra stuff if you want it.

540
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,114
Speaker 0: So it's not a total waste to get the to get the fancy full box.

541
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:43,360
Speaker 1: The mats are stupid.

542
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I don't even know why you need mats.

543
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,773
Speaker 0: But you know life counters would be good because we keep using paper to count life.

544
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:54,319
Speaker 0: or you know cell phone cell phones And it's not the most convenient thing.

545
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:55,180
Speaker 0: counters.

546
00:32:55,421 --> 00:33:00,353
Speaker 0: you know 2d 10 is what you really want to get to count your life in this game because every character basically has a.

547
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:07,626
Speaker 1: I wouldn't mind just playing it on a smartphone The whole game on a smartphone.

548
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,136
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see no reason why they couldn't do that.

549
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:12,485
Speaker 0: Yeah That'd be pretty cool.

550
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:13,188
Speaker 1: They would.

551
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,590
Speaker 0: and one of the one of the things I don't like about this game though I guess it's sort of mandatory.

552
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,260
Speaker 0: I said it's two-player, right?

553
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,893
Speaker 0: It's like I sort of wish it was more than two players somehow.

554
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:23,280
Speaker 0: That would be totally cool.

555
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:31,008
Speaker 1: It would be possible if they made another set which obviously is probably gonna happen to have rules for like Alright - on - and like here's.

556
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:33,100
Speaker 0: you can have tournaments that you know.

557
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,080
Speaker 0: You could take any of the Street Fighter multi-play modes Johnny Cage versus Johnny Cage.

558
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:39,653
Speaker 0: He could have knockout mode where.

559
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:40,668
Speaker 0: basically, you know You have.

560
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:46,840
Speaker 0: you know You have two teams and the team's the weakest guy in each team fights and the winner fights the next guy or you play where?

561
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,150
Speaker 1: You both have two characters and just have a make up a rule where you tag out.

562
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:56,728
Speaker 1: We mean tag out like I tag out to my other character by spending an action The car you the other guy.

563
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:58,860
Speaker 0: so you play it more like more tomorrow versus cap.

564
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you keep track of the three hip HP's of the characters separately of three decks.

565
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:09,980
Speaker 0: Yeah Three discard piles and three hands and you guys least you can only use one at a time at any given turn.

566
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,447
Speaker 0: I could dig that but what do you have?

567
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:12,492
Speaker 0: but you would just tag you.

568
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,040
Speaker 0: tagging out doesn't cost you anything.

569
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:18,431
Speaker 1: Well, you got to come up with a good way to do it or wait for an official version Which will probably come.

570
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:19,339
Speaker 1: that does stuff like that.

571
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:26,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would make it like discard two cards to tag out or you know, something like that Yep, or you have to successfully dodge or block.

572
00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:27,879
Speaker 0: Yeah something like, you know.

573
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:29,466
Speaker 0: Or maybe like.

574
00:34:29,888 --> 00:34:36,112
Speaker 0: if you tag out then you you you know, you cannot You must attack or throw you, you know, you can't.

575
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:37,579
Speaker 0: you know some sort of restriction like that?

576
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:38,505
Speaker 0: I don't know.

577
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:40,800
Speaker 0: But yeah, the game has knockdowns.

578
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,362
Speaker 0: it's got.

579
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:42,705
Speaker 0: you know, it's got some weird.

580
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:44,150
Speaker 0: are some weird rules like the?

581
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:49,585
Speaker 0: if you get knocked down then you can't be blocked by Like something mix-ups.

582
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:54,485
Speaker 0: It's like why it's kind of weird, but it's it explains it pretty clearly on one of the cards To help you out.

583
00:34:54,808 --> 00:34:55,009
Speaker 1: Yep.

584
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:56,320
Speaker 1: I mean it's once you learn it.

585
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,167
Speaker 1: It's actually really straightforward.

586
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:00,074
Speaker 1: The rules are just like I'll fold out.

587
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:01,520
Speaker 1: magic is way harder than this.

588
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,726
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I mean, it's not.

589
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:08,315
Speaker 0: I wouldn't say it's like the greatest game in the world But it's a two-player game, which is rare, right?

590
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:09,320
Speaker 1: You can just rip it out.

591
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:10,671
Speaker 0: It's got a lot of replay value.

592
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:11,720
Speaker 0: You can play it very quickly.

593
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,520
Speaker 0: I mean if you play it with people who know the rules, it's as quick as a round of fighting.

594
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:22,791
Speaker 0: You know of Street Fighter, which is pretty great You know, the only things is that it is no fooling.

595
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:28,220
Speaker 1: pretty much rock paper scissors plus randomness determines Which of course, I mean Scott and I played two rounds earlier.

596
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,560
Speaker 1: I barely won the second one and I Scott got a flawless victory on the first one.

597
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,253
Speaker 1: I literally lost every paper rock scissor the whole time.

598
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,216
Speaker 1: I do dodge.

599
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:39,988
Speaker 1: He does throw I do attack He does block like it was just perfect.

600
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:40,490
Speaker 1: Perfect.

601
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:41,073
Speaker 1: Perfect.

602
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:42,419
Speaker 1: There was nothing I could do.

603
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:45,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you lose the right paper scissors every time you lose.

604
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:48,727
Speaker 0: that's just how it goes Right and that may you know.

605
00:35:48,787 --> 00:35:54,285
Speaker 0: and the thing is that's what fighting games are at the highest level is rock paper scissors With some randomness, right?

606
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:58,980
Speaker 1: Well all games break down to either arbitrary random or solvable.

607
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,447
Speaker 0: I mean, there's no solvable because you're against a human opponent.

608
00:36:01,468 --> 00:36:02,210
Speaker 0: What are you gonna solve?

609
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,410
Speaker 0: Right?

610
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:02,671
Speaker 0: You don't.

611
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:03,634
Speaker 0: he could push any button.

612
00:36:03,654 --> 00:36:07,385
Speaker 1: Ah, I Play tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.

613
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:09,191
Speaker 0: No, no, but I mean there's.

614
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:17,438
Speaker 0: there's so many possible attacks that it's not a solvable thing Right, yeah in a fighting game now unless you you you're trying to defend it could be a broken fighting game.

615
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:21,880
Speaker 0: where it's like Aha, this unblockable combo over and over again will win and that's a solution.

616
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:23,900
Speaker 1: That's basically why Kenshiro wins every fight.

617
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:32,169
Speaker 0: Yeah But but non-broken one attack that in non broken fighting games when you've mastered the execution it comes down to rock paper scissors Plus a little bit of randomness.

618
00:36:32,632 --> 00:36:33,739
Speaker 0: All right, and that's what Yomi is.

619
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,531
Speaker 1: Yeah, well or you know Bushido blade came down to.

620
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:38,640
Speaker 1: I know how to do the throw and no one else does.

621
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:41,453
Speaker 0: Yeah, but think about it.

622
00:36:41,514 --> 00:36:47,560
Speaker 0: It's like okay I'm by sitting your guile and we're playing Street Fighter where we're both masters, right?

623
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:55,540
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna go and try to do this attack You know and people always talk about like you try to trick the other guy into doing a move to leave himself open.

624
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:56,909
Speaker 0: You know, that's that's all.

625
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:58,520
Speaker 0: that's exactly what it's all about in Yomi.

626
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:06,360
Speaker 1: It's like the old samurai fights where you know I will open myself up to let him hit me knowing that he will hit me on mortally, but I will hit him mortally.

627
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, I sort of like this idea though.

628
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:11,280
Speaker 0: I wish that it would expand to more areas, right?

629
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,200
Speaker 0: Like maybe what we should do is go in both directions, right?

630
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,092
Speaker 1: You know wait, so we take an RTS and make it turn based.

631
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:19,868
Speaker 0: No like a turn It's not what I'm talking about.

632
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:20,109
Speaker 0: Right?

633
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,660
Speaker 0: So in Street Fighter, right?

634
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:29,544
Speaker 0: they took out the execution component so that people who couldn't execute could learn and appreciate the Strategic component.

635
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:35,744
Speaker 0: and maybe some of those people will go back and play fighting games and maybe some fighting game people will play Yomi And it'll cross over right?

636
00:37:36,206 --> 00:37:46,799
Speaker 0: Maybe what we need to do is take some other games, you know and remove a component that people can't get past right and cross them over for those games that skill right.

637
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,932
Speaker 0: or We can do is we can take games Scott.

638
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,663
Speaker 1: They did that her first-person shooters They made Halo.

639
00:37:52,683 --> 00:38:02,960
Speaker 0: All right, but I'm talking about we can take say Puerto Rico add an execution component You know and keep the same strategy as Puerto Rico, but at execution make it a video game.

640
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,948
Speaker 0: You've got a crocodile your brown guys into the plantations exact something, you know something along those lines You know.

641
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:11,140
Speaker 0: you take this, you know.

642
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:19,182
Speaker 0: Take a game that has a strategy and an execution remove one or the other take a game that only has one add the other You know.

643
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:28,496
Speaker 0: try to get crossover because I feel like this is how even though these these two different games will have the same strategy Or same execution component at least no crossover between the community

644
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:32,054
Speaker 1: when I imagine board games Like I'm playing Puerto Rico a whole bunch and I think about man.

645
00:38:32,094 --> 00:38:33,100
Speaker 1: What kind of game do I want?

646
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:46,151
Speaker 1: It's always take Puerto Rico and add one additional component or remove one fundamental component Or replace one component and it's basically that yeah I mean you look, you know, some people are sort of doing it.

647
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:50,114
Speaker 0: Like you look at Le Havre is pretty much Calus plus Agricola.

648
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:53,747
Speaker 0: Yeah Mine is as much in the inside is a theme.

649
00:38:53,807 --> 00:38:59,416
Speaker 1: the theme of Le Havre is basically boats get victory point pictures of boats get points.

650
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:02,161
Speaker 1: how Abstractions.

651
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:03,807
Speaker 0: at least Calus has a real theme.

652
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:05,713
Speaker 1: Yeah put stuff in the castle.

653
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:07,740
Speaker 0: I played a game of Calus board game.

654
00:39:07,881 --> 00:39:09,447
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I want to play Calus again.

655
00:39:09,488 --> 00:39:14,302
Speaker 1: real bad crushed it because you went into the castle Castle.

656
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:20,000
Speaker 0: this other guy did all gold and he was using second place But but he didn't castle at all.

657
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:28,820
Speaker 0: So yeah, I lost a bunch of points and this other guy was way behind like dead last But he caught up to second place in the last in the final round, but I won the dungeon and the walls.

658
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:32,420
Speaker 0: He won the tower and I still did pretty good in the towers and no one can catch.

659
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,387
Speaker 1: You know kids if you'd gone to our how to win a games panel We told you all how to win Calus.

660
00:39:36,568 --> 00:39:37,352
Speaker 0: direct path to big.

661
00:39:37,392 --> 00:39:38,658
Speaker 1: just go to the castle correct.

662
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:44,530
Speaker 0: bad favors favors favors Bottom bottom favor track to get free buildings.

663
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, I built a blue building.

664
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:47,060
Speaker 0: No one else built a blue building.

665
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,443
Speaker 0: I won.

666
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:49,095
Speaker 1: Yep buildings and victory points.

667
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,626
Speaker 0: Yep No one can stop me.

668
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:51,947
Speaker 0: All right.

669
00:39:52,048 --> 00:39:53,053
Speaker 1: But yeah, yo me is fun.

670
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:54,400
Speaker 0: I even made a mistake.

671
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,875
Speaker 0: I probably could have had two blue buildings because I forgot the gold mine existed and I didn't.

672
00:39:58,935 --> 00:40:01,308
Speaker 0: I could have chosen the green building Favor one more time.

673
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:05,411
Speaker 1: Nah, but anyway God I really want to play Calus now.

674
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:06,657
Speaker 1: Yes, like real bad.

675
00:40:06,677 --> 00:40:07,139
Speaker 0: Let's do it.

676
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:11,151
Speaker 0: Anyway, so yo me yo me is the new hotness.

677
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:13,600
Speaker 0: Everyone's talking about it and not with no reason.

678
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,327
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not the greatest but it's good.

679
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:18,640
Speaker 1: I posit because we've had a worth your worth your money.

680
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:18,961
Speaker 0: We have

681
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:26,183
Speaker 1: had a renaissance like a study really a renaissance but a surge of this kind of game lately in our crew at Conventions 10

682
00:40:26,183 --> 00:40:27,407
Speaker 0: billion times better than munchkin

683
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:33,708
Speaker 1: because there are two times when we need a game that we can whip out Relatively quickly without a lot of fuss and mess.

684
00:40:33,728 --> 00:40:44,279
Speaker 1: that can be taught easily and played to completion before the line moves standing in line for something or Warming up while we're waiting for everyone to finish their business to play a real game?

685
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, and spot it.

686
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:49,180
Speaker 1: jungle speed and yo me are like the three best games for the M banana grams.

687
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,880
Speaker 0: Yeah the problem I keep having though is that People play these games and then these games dominate like people just sit there playing spot it for an hour.

688
00:40:55,942 --> 00:41:01,810
Speaker 0: It's like no You're supposed to spot it for like a minute while someone sets up the cube game And once the cube game is set up stop playing spots.

689
00:41:01,851 --> 00:41:03,720
Speaker 1: the fundamental problem of the cube game.

690
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,759
Speaker 1: We got to play the cube game up in that hallway above the expo hall instead of down in the bottom of the expo.

691
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,262
Speaker 1: Haha.

692
00:41:10,483 --> 00:41:10,825
Speaker 0: Yeah.

693
00:41:11,328 --> 00:41:11,670
