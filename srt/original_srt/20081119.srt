Speaker 1: How about you?

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,213
Speaker 1: It's a secret.

26
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:17,399
Speaker 0: I just need to know what rims doing so and as long as I'm not doing the same thing I don't need to say what I'm doing.

27
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,049
Speaker 1: well apparently that just failed.

28
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:20,718
Speaker 0: Apparently it just did.

29
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:27,464
Speaker 0: but to make you feel old anyway Penny arcade as of Monday is ten years old a decade.

30
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:31,982
Speaker 1: I have not lived through three of them.

31
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:41,570
Speaker 0: I was Let's see I'm 26 almost 27, so I was 17 when penny arcade came into existence.

32
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:51,498
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that penny arcade has been a stalwart companion to my life for much of that ten years Like I. it's difficult for me to.

33
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:52,502
Speaker 0: it's weird for it to be.

34
00:01:52,642 --> 00:01:54,930
Speaker 1: I'm in my life before I read penny arcade.

35
00:01:55,131 --> 00:02:01,614
Speaker 0: The weirdest thing is that it's ten years old, but I've only read it since like 99-2000. what was it?

36
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,351
Speaker 0: Did they?

37
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:05,037
Speaker 0: are they counting stuff before that?

38
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,210
Speaker 0: as like you know when are they counting the starting date?

39
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:10,630
Speaker 1: Clearly you count the same way we count geek nights.

40
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:17,835
Speaker 1: I mean the first episode we ever uploaded to the internet for you know real people not just Visigoths and front-row crew.

41
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:20,826
Speaker 1: It's to listen to was on November 1st.

42
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:23,074
Speaker 1: in what 2005 Mmm.

43
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:23,658
Speaker 0: I think so.

44
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:24,665
Speaker 0: or October 31st?

45
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:25,832
Speaker 1: No, no it was.

46
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:39,370
Speaker 1: it was November 1st, and we uploaded shows for that whole week, and then that weekend I retroactively Uploaded because we'd been recording shows for like two and a half weeks before that just not uploading them because they were terrible.

47
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:45,709
Speaker 1: But I decided after listening to it that the October 31st episode was good, so I retroactively uploaded it.

48
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:46,672
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:56,735
Speaker 0: okay the first actual penny arcade comic put on the web was November 18th 98 1998 so I didn't.

50
00:02:56,915 --> 00:03:00,968
Speaker 0: I didn't read it though until like 99 so it took me like a year to get to it.

51
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,258
Speaker 1: the 1997-98 season of Marching band in my high school.

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,410
Speaker 1: We played the Independence Day soundtrack When that movie was new and popular.

53
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,242
Speaker 1: Wow You know in retrospect that movie wasn't really that good.

54
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:17,970
Speaker 0: what I kind of like an event is there.

55
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,258
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not like I'd.

56
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:27,464
Speaker 1: it had the speech all the scenes With certain people punching people and yelling at people and dragging people through the desert.

57
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:27,826
Speaker 1: Yep.

58
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:33,616
Speaker 0: I could have been at a barbecue and No Yeah, that was pretty good proof.

59
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:34,540
Speaker 1: That was it.

60
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,745
Speaker 1: the rest of the movie was crap.

61
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:38,836
Speaker 0: It wasn't crap It was just a normal average.

62
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,430
Speaker 0: You know average would become her blockbuster action movie with silliness.

63
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:46,884
Speaker 1: But if I but for all the action that was in it to any day.

64
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:48,410
Speaker 1: I'd rather watch the rock.

65
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:49,456
Speaker 0: I'm not I'm not.

66
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:51,450
Speaker 0: I'm not saying I want to watch in the pen.

67
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:53,710
Speaker 0: Don't get out of yourself.

68
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:58,936
Speaker 1: Independence Day lover.

69
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:02,069
Speaker 0: oh yes, it's my favorite of all time.

70
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:03,706
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what though?

71
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:10,526
Speaker 1: Anime will always make you feel young Because anytime you're at a con and you start feeling old because you look around and you see all the.

72
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:13,802
Speaker 0: you see that guy who's like Yeah, man, remember tow board the eighth man.

73
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:15,370
Speaker 0: You're like, yes, I'm not old.

74
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:23,944
Speaker 0: But then you see someone who comes around is like Sailor Moon's old school and you're like, no I'm old that guy with tow boards just older.

75
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:24,930
Speaker 1: I remember it Oda Khan.

76
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,210
Speaker 1: I overheard a conversation where someone was like, yeah, I only watch old-school anime, you know, like Dragon Ball and bleach.

77
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,882
Speaker 1: I don't like this Naruto business.

78
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:35,757
Speaker 0: Ah Isn't bleached newer than Naruto, I don't know.

79
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:37,101
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it is.

80
00:04:37,462 --> 00:04:40,550
Speaker 1: I lump them all into that same era of anime.

81
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,670
Speaker 1: Good But I remember also, you know tow board the eighth man.

82
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,518
Speaker 1: I remember when some old men were talking about.

83
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:53,550
Speaker 1: I heard eight man and I turn around I see the old man The old man who used to always be on that old fart anime panel.

84
00:04:53,971 --> 00:05:03,703
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was like, hey eight man after and they were like eight man after they made that in life I Was like I never even seen it.

85
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,349
Speaker 1: Wow, I felt really young.

86
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,139
Speaker 0: It's like hey, I remember what you're talking about.

87
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:12,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing you remember that's old was the remake of what I remember.

88
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:13,794
Speaker 0: That's like.

89
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:16,750
Speaker 0: I remember Astro boy watching that in the 80s in color.

90
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,203
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the remake of what I remember from the 60s.

91
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:30,010
Speaker 1: Oh shit one thing I don't think our generation is quite as equipped to deal with as past generations were is the Fact that the media we consume will eventually die.

92
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:48,504
Speaker 1: I mean I've been reading penny arcade forever and The idea of penny arcade not being there or of gave in taiko not continuing to make that strip while I live While I draw breath, you just have to die before they do That such can easily be arranged.

93
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:49,530
Speaker 0: I know right.

94
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:58,410
Speaker 0: I see when they when you know I'll just kill you at Gabe and tycos funeral and toss you in with them Because of course they'll die at this exact same time and be buried together.

95
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:02,009
Speaker 1: I just I think about how much media has changed and then I don't know my life.

96
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:04,159
Speaker 1: I mean remember we were born in the 80s.

97
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,127
Speaker 1: What was media like in the 80s?

98
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,634
Speaker 0: It was like Voltron.

99
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:10,990
Speaker 0: now what's binding and forming together, but we're staying together.

100
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,914
Speaker 1: What's it gonna be like?

101
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:13,179
Speaker 1: are we just gonna be the old men going?

102
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,934
Speaker 1: Yeah Ava and cowboy bebop and eska flown They're already those.

103
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:17,957
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

104
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:18,238
Speaker 0: Right?

105
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:19,161
Speaker 0: Are we real?

106
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:21,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, Sesame Street when snuffleupagus was still invisible.

107
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:24,538
Speaker 1: Are we still gonna be those old guys.

108
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,370
Speaker 1: when we're 16 70 will we ever find a new anime?

109
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,678
Speaker 1: To talk about in those glowing terms.

110
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,005
Speaker 0: Well, the question anything beat macross.

111
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,049
Speaker 1: Do you remember love?

112
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,554
Speaker 0: Lot of things beat.

113
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:37,477
Speaker 0: do you remember love?

114
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:40,426
Speaker 0: I'm not as enthralled with it as many people seem to be.

115
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:41,550
Speaker 1: it's a great move.

116
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,054
Speaker 0: It's not so great.

117
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:44,037
Speaker 1: I think it's great.

118
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:47,290
Speaker 1: I think I think in fact it was more succinct and thus more powerful.

119
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:56,370
Speaker 0: No, the TV show as far as peer in every fashion and just another bad compilation that diminished You know the quality of having any set of TV series anyway.

120
00:06:56,972 --> 00:07:03,890
Speaker 1: Anyway, I got a little bit of news here before Scott brings up the much bigger and much more commentary worthy news.

121
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:18,581
Speaker 1: But Emily told me quite some time ago about this manga that was done by someone I'm not gonna go through the whole story because eventually we're gonna review this business, but it was called Hetalia and it is about Eddie's head.

122
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:24,199
Speaker 1: He's about hit like hitting like Hetal a Useless another way to say useless.

123
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:37,844
Speaker 1: Okay, the way you're thinking of like Italian This was a manga that basically took all of the Socio-political powers of the poet like World War one era.

124
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:43,489
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought that I remember that I thought it was just like some like fan doujinshi kind of work.

125
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,910
Speaker 1: Them into pretty boys who then argue with each other and fight and it's generally hilarious.

126
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember I remember that but I thought it was like a doujinshi and not a real-deal production.

127
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,815
Speaker 1: Well, yes, that's the news.

128
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:58,090
Speaker 1: You see it was basically like a little comic doujinshi kind of thing.

129
00:07:58,913 --> 00:07:59,916
Speaker 1: One thing led to another.

130
00:07:59,936 --> 00:08:01,501
Speaker 1: the anime is coming out.

131
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:03,950
Speaker 0: Oh, man, that's pretty hot.

132
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:12,703
Speaker 1: I am so excited about this for two reasons because one it proves that the amateur media Can be the gateway to the professional media.

133
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:13,547
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

134
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:14,250
Speaker 1: This is happening.

135
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,518
Speaker 0: That's what excites me about it.

136
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:16,927
Speaker 0: because think about all the.

137
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:21,890
Speaker 0: you know I mean anything that's on the same level as doujinshi, you know, but in the u.s.

138
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,891
Speaker 0: You know things like people making YouTube videos and stuff Right.

139
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:31,150
Speaker 0: any attempt to like take that and then actually go big with it sort of doesn't work.

140
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,054
Speaker 0: It always comes off ham-fisted or doesn't really make it You know as big as could be.

141
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:40,549
Speaker 0: you're like if we created like a sporting league in the backyard and started videotaping it.

142
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,290
Speaker 0: It wouldn't suddenly get on TV and be you know, like competing with the NFL time slots.

143
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:48,059
Speaker 1: It couldn't happen, but but I saw a basketball.

144
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know right actually I didn't I knew better.

145
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:56,387
Speaker 1: It was made by Trey Parker.

146
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:58,117
Speaker 0: Thank he made.

147
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:58,800
Speaker 0: he made something.

148
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,303
Speaker 0: I didn't say.

149
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:00,650
Speaker 1: I don't know if he actually possible.

150
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:01,795
Speaker 1: I you know what.

151
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:06,590
Speaker 1: I'll look it up because all I remember is that that movie was bad anyway.

152
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:15,219
Speaker 0: The the fact that you know, someone can just draw doujinshi and then have it become an anime, you know People that always say oh man, how do I?

153
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,987
Speaker 0: you know, I have this great idea for an anime.

154
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:17,770
Speaker 0: I want to make it happen.

155
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,677
Speaker 0: Well, here's what you do draw doujinshi of it.

156
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,008
Speaker 0: And if it's good then an anime will be made.

157
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:27,300
Speaker 0: maybe There you go Now we can answer that question very easily.

158
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,790
Speaker 0: before it was like ha ha that's impossible.

159
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:33,622
Speaker 1: Now we have an answer but - I'm excited because one.

160
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:38,929
Speaker 1: I got rave reviews from Emily and all the other people who've read it Or know about it, but I like the idea.

161
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:48,983
Speaker 1: I mean, it's the main can is a clever idea is northern Italy and he's useless And he's kind of and everyone that with a big mustache.

162
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:50,809
Speaker 1: No, no, no, they're all pretty boys.

163
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,113
Speaker 1: Everyone's a pretty boy.

164
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,116
Speaker 0: But how does that work?

165
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:55,901
Speaker 0: Mussolini was just so bad.

166
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:59,090
Speaker 1: It's well before the Mussolini came into the picture.

167
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:01,257
Speaker 0: Okay, it's not it's.

168
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:05,310
Speaker 1: and do you know anything about what was going on in the world before World War one?

169
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:06,936
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought you said in World War two.

170
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:10,068
Speaker 1: No, I said, you know post World War one World War one.

171
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:10,249
Speaker 1: ish.

172
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:11,133
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

173
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:11,495
Speaker 0: Never mind.

174
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:13,144
Speaker 1: It leads up to World War two.

175
00:10:13,164 --> 00:10:16,508
Speaker 1: the Kaiser's in there Kaiser's are there but they're all pretty boys.

176
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:18,820
Speaker 0: They did pointy hats.

177
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:24,641
Speaker 0: No Like they who wants to read this no Kaiser's the pointy hats.

178
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:26,387
Speaker 1: So yeah, you haven't seen this at all.

179
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:27,550
Speaker 1: No, I haven't All right.

180
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,304
Speaker 0: I'll say this I just remember seeing that I saw the homepage but actually see the comic.

181
00:10:31,384 --> 00:10:38,006
Speaker 1: as long as they don't do fiss up Anime this is gonna be one of those greats that we're gonna watch in love like damecha dobutsu.

182
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:39,410
Speaker 0: Oh, it's gonna be that kind.

183
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,535
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that is my hope.

184
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:41,862
Speaker 0: That's my favorite guy.

185
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:43,529
Speaker 1: They make it that kind of show.

186
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:44,994
Speaker 1: I'm all about it.

187
00:10:45,054 --> 00:10:50,849
Speaker 1: or if they do like the asamanga daioh treatment where because they take the kind or the treatment of the show We're gonna talk about today.

188
00:10:51,016 --> 00:11:02,369
Speaker 1: Yes same kind of treatment where you instead of trying to turn the comic into a long overarching possibly serious or just standard show you turn it into the kind of comic show like asamanga daioh.

189
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,996
Speaker 1: that Asamanga daioh was great because of that.

190
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:10,105
Speaker 1: It was a bunch of vignettes that were just set in the awesome world of azuma.

191
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:20,865
Speaker 1: Anyway check out Italia and we will probably be gonna spell that because I still can't figure H-e-t-a-l-i-a.

192
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,386
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz the way you say it it just sounds like you're saying Italia Italia.

193
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:30,863
Speaker 1: All right Whatever, you know, it's all right Italia Italia because Italy.

194
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:31,906
Speaker 0: but it sounds like you're not.

195
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:34,998
Speaker 0: it sounds like you're saying hits But the H is very quick and silent.

196
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:37,287
Speaker 0: So it sounds like you're just saying Italia like Italy.

197
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:50,663
Speaker 0: fine So, okay This news is just too crazy to possibly not say anything about.

198
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:55,030
Speaker 0: so I got to go over all these details One at a time and I don't know where to start.

199
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,730
Speaker 0: So let me just pick a place to start here by randomness.

200
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,081
Speaker 0: Crunchyroll the evil crunchyroll, right?

201
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,185
Speaker 0: We hated them so much.

202
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:04,310
Speaker 0: Why do we hate them so much?

203
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:15,886
Speaker 0: Well crunchyroll started out is basically a YouTube clone that only had Anime and mostly copyrighted anime that was uploaded by users and they were making money off of that.

204
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:22,409
Speaker 0: They even got venture capital Basically, so instead of a business that does nothing but break the law and made money off it.

205
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:25,727
Speaker 0: man If I knew you could get away with that, I wouldn't be here right now.

206
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:26,250
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

207
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:35,630
Speaker 0: And so these assholes who we don't like at crunchyroll, you know got the venture capital And then now that they had money they didn't need to be legal anymore.

208
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,336
Speaker 0: So they started going legit and whatnot.

209
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,805
Speaker 0: and now they're going super legit.

210
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:54,070
Speaker 0: on January 8th Crunchyroll will stop accepting user submitted videos and they will only host videos approved by copyright holders Ganzo Toei two other Japanese copyright holders of anime that are not listed.

211
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:56,307
Speaker 0: So that's the first thing.

212
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:04,750
Speaker 0: the second thing Crunchyroll is also going to provide right if you pay a subscription fee.

213
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:07,749
Speaker 0: So basically you subscribe to crunchyroll, right?

214
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:14,665
Speaker 0: You'll be able to watch Naruto about an hour after it's on TV in Japan.

215
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:15,910
Speaker 0: So it's on TV in Japan.

216
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:24,530
Speaker 0: 60 minutes later, it'll be on crunchyroll And if you pay a subscription fee, you could watch it on crunchyroll with English subtitles anywhere in the world.

217
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:28,660
Speaker 0: Alright, so the the companies is starting to make a move here.

218
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:31,470
Speaker 0: Obviously, you know, the fan says better watch out.

219
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:52,830
Speaker 1: I mean remember way back when digi selves and all these things first started coming out and then there were all the copyright issues and What everyone always said what every anime fan at the time was saying was that hey The reason we pirate is because you know price aside because they say a price whatever I'm watching the show I want to watch it when it's out in Japan.

220
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:56,426
Speaker 1: Why do I have to wait, you know, six months a year to see it in the u.s.

221
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:59,266
Speaker 1: And wait for some dub I don't even want to hear in the first place.

222
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:08,227
Speaker 1: If the anime companies would just allow me to pay him out his fee to see the shows as they come out Subtitled I would gladly pay it.

223
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:14,914
Speaker 0: Well, here's the chance to walk the walk because you know, but I don't like Naruto I know me either.

224
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:22,070
Speaker 0: but the thing is it's like, you know different people when they talk about copyright might You know side on yes or no or whatever.

225
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,773
Speaker 0: But they always have everyone sort of has a different reason or a different excuse They come up with.

226
00:14:26,814 --> 00:14:29,123
Speaker 0: you know, one person will say oh, it's not digital.

227
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:30,529
Speaker 0: another person will say oh, it's DRM.

228
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,841
Speaker 0: Another person says it's not subtitled.

229
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:34,450
Speaker 0: You know, everyone says something different.

230
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:38,410
Speaker 0: Well, there's a bunch of people out there who did say that they don't want to wait.

231
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:47,039
Speaker 0: So for the first time possibly ever someone even though it's the shitty crunchyroll Is saying alright put your money where your mouth is bitches.

232
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:47,240
Speaker 0: Here.

233
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,550
Speaker 0: It is one hour after it's up in Japan with subtitles.

234
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:52,367
Speaker 0: are you going to pay for it?

235
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:56,901
Speaker 0: and I could see it going both ways You know.

236
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:03,190
Speaker 0: on the one hand I think that there are people who just wanted it quickly and did have the money and I think they will pay and watch it.

237
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:11,404
Speaker 0: on the other hand I still think that a lot of the people watching are high school kids with no money and they won't pay under any Circumstance even if it was just.

238
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:17,690
Speaker 0: you know The whole thing immediately live and download in the perfect quality for a penny.

239
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:19,357
Speaker 0: They wouldn't pay because they don't have a penny.

240
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,809
Speaker 1: Well, that's where the second part of this comes in.

241
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:27,170
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly seven days after an episode airs, right?

242
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,525
Speaker 0: So it's on TV Tokyo in Japan.

243
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:34,419
Speaker 0: one hour later It'll be on crunchyroll and people who pay monthly fees can watch it.

244
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:41,238
Speaker 0: I'm What can you subtitle in an hour?

245
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:43,310
Speaker 0: They must be working pretty closely to get the subtitles.

246
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:55,530
Speaker 0: Um seven days after that it will be able to watch the episode of Naruto free on crunchyroll But also on Hulu Naruto calm and a whole bunch of other websites.

247
00:15:56,212 --> 00:15:58,179
Speaker 0: So it's pretty much gonna be.

248
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:01,350
Speaker 0: hey if you want to watch an hour to the last week's episode of Naruto.

249
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:05,041
Speaker 0: It'll be free to watch online almost anywhere now.

250
00:16:05,202 --> 00:16:07,209
Speaker 1: I assume there will be ads here.

251
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:18,008
Speaker 0: I assume there's gonna be ads and you know, actually I look at this and I say, you know what this is Someone even though it's stupid crunchyroll yet again, right it part of it.

252
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:21,138
Speaker 0: Someone is actually smart and in control.

253
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,946
Speaker 0: right look Cartoon Network kicked all the anime off.

254
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,170
Speaker 0: tsunamis dead, right?

255
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,939
Speaker 0: They can't get their anime on TV.

256
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,164
Speaker 0: It's just not working.

257
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:30,430
Speaker 0: It's not gonna happen, right?

258
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,465
Speaker 0: Okay, the fan sub people are still downloading.

259
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,490
Speaker 0: They're still out there.

260
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,939
Speaker 0: You still see Naruto headbands at every convention.

261
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,110
Speaker 0: Naruto fans are still out and about right there all over the place.

262
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:42,117
Speaker 0: They have not really gone away.

263
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,466
Speaker 0: the manga sells the anime.

264
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:45,510
Speaker 0: DVDs do not sell.

265
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:50,970
Speaker 0: So they have this anime property which is the core of Naruto this animation, right?

266
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,236
Speaker 0: It's it, you know, and then the manga is right behind that.

267
00:16:53,898 --> 00:17:04,050
Speaker 0: they can sell anything that says Naruto on it Naruto backpacks Naruto shoes Naruto headbands Naruto figures Naruto cards Naruto video games, but they can't actually sell the anime.

268
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:05,796
Speaker 0: They can't sell it on TV.

269
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:07,421
Speaker 0: They can't sell DVDs.

270
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,227
Speaker 0: They can't sell digital downloads.

271
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:10,010
Speaker 0: They can't sell it.

272
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,949
Speaker 0: No one's buying it, but they're still making it and they're still paying for it with sponsorships on.

273
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:20,809
Speaker 0: you know The ads that they show on Japanese television are still paying for this anime to be made.

274
00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:22,969
Speaker 0: So why not?

275
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:29,490
Speaker 0: You know a week later put it on the internet, you know and make a few bucks extra off a couple of crappy ads.

276
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:30,746
Speaker 1: Well, it gives you a couple of things.

277
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:36,947
Speaker 1: one It gives you the moral imperative to get rid of the fansubbers now because their last excuse is gone.

278
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:40,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean What excuse to the fansubbers really?

279
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:45,141
Speaker 0: We wanted subtitled and we want it for free.

280
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,225
Speaker 0: Well you have both now.

281
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:47,610
Speaker 0: we want it immediately.

282
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,361
Speaker 0: Well, you can get that if you pay some money.

283
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:53,762
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's a week late It's it's like how much faster do you really need it?

284
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:55,590
Speaker 0: Is it gonna make that much of a difference in your life?

285
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,834
Speaker 1: I foresee the thing is.

286
00:17:56,874 --> 00:18:10,630
Speaker 1: the only thing they're not doing yet that I could see them doing Is having a third pillar of this and not like Nintendo's fake third pillar But a real third pillar if the show was on immediately for you know for the pay and then later for free.

287
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:22,366
Speaker 1: But there's the third option not DVDs but of buying Unencumbered DRM free versions that you can then watch on your iPhone and whatever that is.

288
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:24,394
Speaker 0: the one problem with this is by Streaming.

289
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:30,770
Speaker 0: there's no way to watch Naruto on the iPhone or anything like that Because have to be at a computer because it's out there free.

290
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:34,210
Speaker 1: Anyway, I think that'll really cut down on a lot of the casual piracy.

291
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:39,910
Speaker 1: So if you're doing it anyway, you might as well sell a really easy to watch like iTunes.

292
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:43,132
Speaker 1: Well, I think what it even if people pirated Yep Who cares?

293
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:49,009
Speaker 0: and I think even if it does not cut into the fansubbers right that they still prefer their fansubs to the.

294
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:51,017
Speaker 0: you know The the official release whatever.

295
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:54,833
Speaker 0: I think what it's gonna do is gonna get a. but you know There's only.

296
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:56,218
Speaker 0: so you go to look at a torrent.

297
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:59,430
Speaker 0: there's only like a thousand a few thousand people on these torrents, right?

298
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,203
Speaker 0: There's a lot more than a few thousand Naruto fans.

299
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:04,556
Speaker 0: I mean Otacon has 20-30,000 people at it, right?

300
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:14,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, all of the Naruto fans in the world only a fraction of them get fansubs.

301
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:25,630
Speaker 0: So I think what's gonna happen is all the people who are not nerdy enough to even use bit torrent Which is which is stupidly easy are gonna go this way and you're actually gonna get a lot more Naruto watchers.

302
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:34,889
Speaker 0: you're gonna increase the Naruto audience and We're gonna go back to what the model for anime and such should be which is Put this stuff out.

303
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:43,749
Speaker 0: There's that people watch it and follow it and then make your money by selling them things that you know Actually are not piratable like Naruto headbands.

304
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:57,530
Speaker 1: Well, you know It's the same business model that South Park is using where you have the only replace the pay to watch it right away with Watch it right away on TV where the advertisers pay Mmm, but that's just one step away.

305
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,580
Speaker 1: I mean that's still within the grasp of the anime industry.

306
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:09,570
Speaker 1: the anime industry just needs to I don't know prove that it can play With the big boys and actually market to Americans average Americans normal people not just anime fans.

307
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:11,846
Speaker 0: Well, you know we said it a million times, right?

308
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:14,057
Speaker 0: Anime who's was big?

309
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:19,609
Speaker 0: if you look at the bigness of anime in this country when it's on TV It's big and when it's not on TV, it's not big.

310
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:27,649
Speaker 0: It's all about putting it on TV kids coming home from school watching it when they get home instead of watching something else, you know.

311
00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:29,546
Speaker 0: And then going out.

312
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:35,510
Speaker 0: and you know I had Transformers and Voltron stuff when I was a kid because it was on TV when I got home.

313
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:39,450
Speaker 0: I would have never paid for Voltron on tape not in a million years.

314
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,402
Speaker 0: No, you know now I've got Voltron DVDs, but that's you know.

315
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,046
Speaker 0: besides the point it's not tape.

316
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:51,725
Speaker 0: it's not tape You know, it's all about if you you know making money off the stuff.

317
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:56,263
Speaker 0: when they put you know Back in the day when they put GI Joe on TV They were.

318
00:20:56,366 --> 00:21:01,443
Speaker 0: you know The ads that went on TV with GI Joe were just there because they could.

319
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:04,230
Speaker 0: they didn't expect to make money off the show itself.

320
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,461
Speaker 0: They expected to make money by selling you GI Joe figures.

321
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:10,010
Speaker 0: that's how you make money with television.

322
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,888
Speaker 0: That's how it works, especially kids television, you know, even Sesame Street will sell you.

323
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:15,530
Speaker 0: tickle me Elmo.

324
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,188
Speaker 0: They don't give a shit and they're public TV.

325
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,437
Speaker 0: That's paid for by us and the government.

326
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:25,570
Speaker 1: and so what I really foresee happening now is I don't know if the mainstream You know on TV with ads again is gonna happen.

327
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:35,064
Speaker 1: But I definitely see this kind of fixing the problem where there are two classes of anime fans The younger fans or the casual fans who aren't willing to pay.

328
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:46,923
Speaker 1: and then you know the people like us who buy DVD box sets because Shows that are on right now the shows that appeal to the young Moneyless kids are the shows that'll be on Hulu all the time to watch.

329
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:55,144
Speaker 1: right now all the current stuff coming out that the kids really care about There's the classics the shows that are old and great that we want to watch or the shows that

330
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:56,950
Speaker 0: are already on DVD box sets

331
00:21:57,231 --> 00:22:01,830
Speaker 1: Or the shows that just aren't popular enough initially to warrant this sort of attention.

332
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,250
Speaker 1: But then you know later people want those will be taken up by the DVD box sales.

333
00:22:06,512 --> 00:22:11,750
Speaker 1: And I think in the end we're gonna have a kind of yeah Cuz if something balance has been restored to the force.

334
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:19,183
Speaker 0: Maybe cuz if this is just like you said if there's a show that's popular with the kiddies a kids show The only you can't make money from kids.

335
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:24,090
Speaker 0: you have to sell them You know by selling them video because they have infinite video and infinite time to watch it.

336
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,750
Speaker 0: You can only make money from kids by selling them toys and video games and stuff.

337
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,688
Speaker 1: But like ghost in the shell DVDs sold just fine from what I could tell.

338
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:38,470
Speaker 0: yeah You know you know ghost in the shell the anime sells itself You know and you put if you give that in the video of that away for free.

339
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,270
Speaker 0: You're not gonna.

340
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:53,211
Speaker 0: You can't sell too many ghosts in the shell toys because ghosts in the shell fans are not so much the toy buyers Really yeah, so I hope that's the way it goes And I hope they realize that just you know when you release an anime It's it's slim K You know it's.

341
00:22:53,312 --> 00:23:04,690
Speaker 0: either go with the one model of free video and then sell merchandise or go with the other model of Immediate slim case box set skip all the other possible release models cuz no one wants that shit.

342
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,110
Speaker 1: Yep I guess the only other thing would be for shows that don't get kind of the full online treatment.

343
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:15,708
Speaker 1: If I were licensing stuff I would always make the first four episodes of any show I guess except a four episode show.

344
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:22,789
Speaker 1: yeah Four episode of OV sorry available for streaming if it was the show that I was gonna try to sell DVDs for.

345
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:28,026
Speaker 1: oh Yeah, definitely like that's not even like the fact that that isn't already done amazes me.

346
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,054
Speaker 0: mm-hmm plus I think you know.

347
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:37,829
Speaker 0: eventually when DVDs are sort of done You're gonna have to make some sort of you know download to watch in the iPhone and action.

348
00:23:38,232 --> 00:23:47,102
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know without DRM I've gotten to the point in my life where there's enough media that I Will no law like I will not stand for DRM.

349
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:48,226
Speaker 1: I'm streaming stuff.

350
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:55,666
Speaker 1: It's fine because I'm streaming it I don't care, but any media I download No amount of DRM is acceptable to me at this point because I could.

351
00:23:55,707 --> 00:24:00,101
Speaker 1: there is always Unencumbered media that I already have that I can watch in lieu.

352
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,950
Speaker 0: I mean D. I mean DVDs technically have DRM.

353
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,014
Speaker 1: Effectively they don't.

354
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:14,034
Speaker 0: yeah, I know right a bit, but I what I do with DVDs these days I rip them to my iPhone format, and then put them away and don't look at them anymore You know.

355
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:19,650
Speaker 0: and then we just watch them by either streaming them from my computer down to the living room Or I watch them on my iPhone.

356
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:27,227
Speaker 0: We don't actually really put discs in the DVD players so much anymore Except for when the DVDs are really old and shitty and difficult to rip.

357
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:31,564
Speaker 0: yeah I guess yeah the best DRM in the world put the check.

358
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,230
Speaker 0: make shitty chapters on your DVDs.

359
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,515
Speaker 0: So no one wants to bother figuring that shit out.

360
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:37,300
Speaker 1: I can't say one thing though.

361
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:46,009
Speaker 1: I Wani fan subbers cried out at once and then we're suddenly silence.

362
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,202
Speaker 0: well We'll see most of the shows that you know.

363
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:52,329
Speaker 1: I guess the oh no They're gonna keep fans up and I know the way these people work.

364
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:55,830
Speaker 1: They're gonna keep fans up and keep pushing and keep trying to do their thing.

365
00:24:56,513 --> 00:25:00,429
Speaker 1: But one I think there's gonna be a lot more legal pressure coming down on them, too.

366
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:09,043
Speaker 1: They're gonna lose the tacit support or at least the tacit indifference of the kind of Average anime fan who isn't a poor punk kid.

367
00:25:09,244 --> 00:25:10,630
Speaker 0: see it's so weird right?

368
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:31,862
Speaker 0: It's like it's almost as if that when when the free Naruto streaming is not available Right the fan subbers seem bad like oh they deserve some sort of legal pressure right in some way They're doing right, but it's like imagine if I started um Recording South Park on my TiVo and then putting it on BitTorrent what?

369
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:33,708
Speaker 0: and it's online for free.

370
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:34,350
Speaker 0: who gives a shit?

371
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:39,816
Speaker 0: I'm not no one's even gonna download from me right, but somehow They're going to evolve separately.

372
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:51,305
Speaker 1: people who stay with the fan sub community are going to evolve much like the ouster's into a brand new breed of fan sub watching kids with different fan subs different words because I've know.

373
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:58,204
Speaker 1: eventually if that fan sub Documentary is true fan subs are just gonna be romanized versions of the Roger F and E's.

374
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:16,978
Speaker 0: I Don't know if this really counts as thing of the day, but whatever There's a website here den of geek and they made a little article right and the article was called.

375
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:21,260
Speaker 0: I think 70 comics that are being made into movies.

376
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:27,719
Speaker 0: And they went on to list 70 comics that are currently being made into movies and the year that they're expected to be released in.

377
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:49,440
Speaker 0: Then later they added five and I noticed that even after adding five and making it 75 comics being made into films right Surrogates is still not on the list and it says here pending updates and there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 like 13 pending updates and surrogates isn't even listed there.

378
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:59,592
Speaker 0: So there are like a hundred comics currently being made into movies, but not surrogates Which was basically written so that Bruce Willis could.

379
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:00,214
Speaker 0: well, it's good.

380
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:00,515
Speaker 0: I think.

381
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,260
Speaker 0: no I think surrogates is being made into movies.

382
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,931
Speaker 0: It's not on this list on this web page.

383
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:05,120
Speaker 0: is what I'm saying.

384
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:07,626
Speaker 0: I don't know.

385
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:09,860
Speaker 0: It's a pretty long fucking crazy list.

386
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,712
Speaker 0: There's a lot of things on here and I would be surprised if 25% of the things in this list actually appeared in movie theaters.

387
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:18,217
Speaker 1: Where did they get their list from?

388
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:19,180
Speaker 1: did they just make it up?

389
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,677
Speaker 0: I think they just you know.

390
00:27:20,843 --> 00:27:34,600
Speaker 1: Oh They have a link in every single one of these a link to one because I remember I recall I point out That when I was reading the Wikipedia are the links go to places like variety comm Ace showbiz.com.

391
00:27:35,062 --> 00:27:38,196
Speaker 0: I don't know a lot of the comic book resources comm.

392
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:39,040
Speaker 0: most of them are to variety.

393
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:53,265
Speaker 1: point out the time we were talking about the scene at the tower in Seattle the Space Needle and There was that statement that was interesting about the guy punching out a bear and it was in fact cited Multiple sites.

394
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:54,370
Speaker 1: Yeah.

395
00:27:54,872 --> 00:28:00,604
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm dubious of this list I am but the point is is that this is still a Pretty crazy thing.

396
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:06,620
Speaker 0: and if this list teaches you anything right is that Just buy some freaking comics.

397
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,684
Speaker 0: Why are you going to the movies?

398
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:12,220
Speaker 0: you can get all these things in their original forms well in advance for a lot less money.

399
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:15,118
Speaker 1: Well because movies and comics are different.

400
00:28:15,138 --> 00:28:18,507
Speaker 0: Yeah But it's like really the whole.

401
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:25,229
Speaker 0: we should do a whole a show on the whole remake thing because on the one hand I don't have nearly as much vitriol as you do.

402
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:25,711
Speaker 1: It's not.

403
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:26,614
Speaker 0: it's not just.

404
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,320
Speaker 0: it's not really just vitriol.

405
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:46,240
Speaker 0: it's the fact that you know, we have, you know, these different mediums of artistic expression right and you know, there is Something to taking the same core idea and expressing it in different mediums and getting you know Not you're not gonna get the exact same result.

406
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,962
Speaker 0: It's impossible.

407
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:50,132
Speaker 0: right and there, you know things can be interesting that way.

408
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:56,580
Speaker 0: but there is also something to You know certain mediums right like movies.

409
00:28:56,941 --> 00:29:01,013
Speaker 0: There's a lot, you know less original movie creations happening.

410
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:02,277
Speaker 0: At least it seems to be.

411
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:03,159
Speaker 0: then there used to be.

412
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:06,009
Speaker 1: yes I was about to say you're begging questions already.

413
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:12,920
Speaker 0: Whereas, you know in comics, you know, it's see, you know It seems like they're very a less percentage of remakes going on.

414
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:18,198
Speaker 1: I would argue that every continuing issue of x-men is a remake of x-men.

415
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,389
Speaker 0: I'm not counting I'm just counting your titles across the board.

416
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:26,445
Speaker 0: Not the x-factor x-force x-caliber But those are all.

417
00:29:26,486 --> 00:29:28,194
Speaker 0: that's where those things are originally created.

418
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:29,420
Speaker 0: it wasn't comics it's not a remake.

419
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,282
Speaker 0: It's like it's a sequel.

420
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:38,804
Speaker 1: but I mean if different media can present different kinds of messages in different ways then sometimes it's just Remakes are for the better Like for example Lord of the Rings.

421
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:43,860
Speaker 1: the books are good and they're important and they're iconic and they're well-written and they're great.

422
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:46,656
Speaker 1: But I will admit that I enjoyed the movies more.

423
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:47,319
Speaker 0: Well, you're stupid.

424
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:50,639
Speaker 0: I mean the movies are great and all but the book is where it's at.

425
00:29:51,102 --> 00:29:55,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time I'll admit openly that I skipped About half.

426
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:56,429
Speaker 0: maybe I can book.

427
00:29:56,469 --> 00:29:58,720
Speaker 0: maybe that's why you didn't like it.

428
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:02,160
Speaker 1: They were walking and then I skipped a bunch and they were still walking.

429
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:05,012
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the important part in between.

430
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:06,579
Speaker 0: was the poetry that you missed?

431
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:10,384
Speaker 1: I've read the poetry It's just it didn't.

432
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:14,656
Speaker 1: what it conveyed was not the same thing that the movies conveyed?

433
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:16,120
Speaker 0: and no it was not.

434
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,390
Speaker 1: Yes, and I I didn't enjoy the books that much.

435
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:26,006
Speaker 1: I thought the Hobbit I enjoyed a lot more than the Lord of the Rings Actually enjoyed this Really?

436
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:27,531
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

437
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:30,561
Speaker 1: reading the Silmarillion was not terribly entertaining It was.

438
00:30:31,184 --> 00:30:34,860
Speaker 1: it was almost like reading a Wikipedia article about a fantasy world.

439
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,446
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is it's you got a brave.

440
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:42,290
Speaker 0: you take all of its parts together right as one unit Which it you know, it's the one book as a whole.

441
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:44,260
Speaker 0: it is sort of like a Wikipedia article.

442
00:30:44,763 --> 00:30:56,720
Speaker 0: but if you treat these separate parts as almost their Individual novellas Then it comes across Completely differently like that that beginning part that like that's sort of like the Genesis story of Middle-earth is like on its own.

443
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:04,777
Speaker 0: It's like a man's and then you're like the the whole story of like You know Morgoth and a giant war with a million balrogs and a million dragons.

444
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:06,383
Speaker 1: and oh, man I don't find that.

445
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:12,080
Speaker 1: because the thing is that sort of story is no better than the dragon lands equivalent.

446
00:31:12,722 --> 00:31:18,620
Speaker 1: Well, you know argue that dragon lands books existed solely to give you that moment over and over and over again.

447
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:23,120
Speaker 0: Well, the thing about the Lord of the Rings right books is that they were well written.

448
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:24,401
Speaker 0: Well, yeah It's not.

449
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:37,760
Speaker 0: you know in what the content of the stories were even though at the time that was relatively original content Relatively, you know, whereas today we have that same exact content repeated a million times in for said dragon lands books.

450
00:31:38,221 --> 00:31:43,760
Speaker 0: But in that the fashion the poetic fashion in which it was written is the important thing.

451
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:51,820
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, and I very much I adore the poetic fashion But I guess my point is is that one I need a synonym for poetry to sound less.

452
00:31:52,683 --> 00:31:54,899
Speaker 1: One books worth of it was enough for me.

453
00:31:57,161 --> 00:32:03,880
Speaker 0: I can even read the you know, tiny Tom Bombadil short story that is separate from everything else and still be rocking the house.

454
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:05,160
Speaker 1: Well, that store is awesome.

455
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,560
Speaker 1: Why why don't you then go and read the collected works of works of Keats before we continue?

456
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,040
Speaker 0: Because I still have to read the collected works of Milton.

457
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:15,669
Speaker 1: Do you actually intend to read the works of Milton?

458
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:16,693
Speaker 0: I don't know.

459
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:19,909
Speaker 0: but what I do know is that pretty much What drove you to read?

460
00:32:19,949 --> 00:32:20,572
Speaker 1: the works of milk?

461
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:20,994
Speaker 0: I will.

462
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:21,960
Speaker 0: that was about to tell you.

463
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,076
Speaker 1: I'm just curious because it came up in Hyperion.

464
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:28,347
Speaker 0: I know All over the place right you did?

465
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:32,745
Speaker 1: you hit the word Milton ask near the end and suddenly think no No, it wasn't that.

466
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:35,676
Speaker 0: okay, it's that you know all over the place.

467
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:42,380
Speaker 0: throughout my entire life I've encountered, you know such-and-such works of Milton Milton Milton and I'm like.

468
00:32:43,303 --> 00:32:45,570
Speaker 0: I don't even know who Milton was.

469
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,400
Speaker 0: I just I think how could he just have one name?

470
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,083
Speaker 0: He doesn't have two names.

471
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:51,247
Speaker 0: He only has one name.

472
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:52,129
Speaker 0: He's like Homer.

473
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:57,067
Speaker 0: just one name and somehow he's mentioned everywhere Must be important.

474
00:32:57,689 --> 00:33:04,579
Speaker 0: He must have some works somewhere that I can read Mentioned so many places, but maybe I should read them.

475
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:14,475
Speaker 1: but what I would point out is that one you have access Scott to Infinite information more information than you could process in your entire lifetime.

476
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:21,411
Speaker 1: Yep at any time Yeah at any point in your life You could have looked up who Milton was and what he brought.

477
00:33:21,472 --> 00:33:28,677
Speaker 0: at no point in time was I simultaneously Thinking about Milton and also in the access of Wikipedia to having nearby.

478
00:33:28,697 --> 00:33:31,425
Speaker 1: and I also have to say Walt while Milton is very important.

479
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:37,504
Speaker 1: I have not come across people referencing Milton that often I was.

480
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:39,932
Speaker 0: he was referenced enough for me to remember his single name.

481
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:44,290
Speaker 1: people reference Dante a lot more and I'll be honest I did not enjoy the Divine Comedy.

482
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,620
Speaker 0: I did not read any Dante's.

483
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:51,600
Speaker 1: Anyway, my thing of the day to get right into the but I know more about him.

484
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,374
Speaker 1: I know the very important main bit here the show that I've been dying to talk about.

485
00:33:58,056 --> 00:33:59,339

Speaker 1: the music's good.

492
00:34:11,246 --> 00:34:11,848
Speaker 1: the story.

493
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:16,520
Speaker 1: the story that there is, you know, it's a music video is good and it's space invaders.

494
00:34:17,284 --> 00:34:18,453
Speaker 1: I like the song a lot.

495
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:19,580
Speaker 1: I like this a lot.

496
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:22,818
Speaker 1: I don't know what else I can say except that you should watch it and feel touched.

497
00:34:23,502 --> 00:34:27,159
Speaker 1: Touched not in the way that Krauser Sama will touch Vader.

498
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:32,998
Speaker 0: He invades you and he touches you in a Krauser invaded something like the most famous early episode of South Park.

499
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:40,371
Speaker 1: Okay So tonight, that's all That I'm hoping none of you have seen because you should go out and watch it.

500
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:40,974
Speaker 1: It's short.

501
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:42,558
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

502
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:43,360
Speaker 1: It's fresh.

503
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,616
Speaker 1: So all you people saying we don't talk about new anime.

504
00:34:45,657 --> 00:34:57,820
Speaker 1: Here we go Detroit metal city Troy tomato lashiti AKA the wacky hijinks of Krauser Sahn and his merry pain Krauser time.

505
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:14,877
Speaker 0: So lately, you know, I've been really big on like these sort of like these shorter anime shows You know like they've existed before, you know, they're old shows like Ipatsu Kiki Musume where it's a. you know a bunch of short episodes, maybe not even a bunch maybe just like ten of them.

506
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:31,620
Speaker 0: right and Instead of going all out with a 26 episode series, you know And this is usually done for strictly like short comedy things Look at a show like Dama go dobutsu, right a lot of short episodes that are mostly just you know quick short funny stories.

507
00:35:31,941 --> 00:35:33,064
Speaker 0: They don't have a lot of.

508
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:36,636
Speaker 0: you know, those quiet scenes of looking at the sky for 30 seconds.

509
00:35:36,816 --> 00:35:37,900
Speaker 1: Hey, wait, what about that?

510
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,004
Speaker 1: Really bad.

511
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:43,779
Speaker 1: I will not name it because it was so bad Nazi show that was all short episode.

512
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,759
Speaker 1: If you say the name two more times, we'll have to watch it.

513
00:35:49,761 --> 00:36:04,225
Speaker 0: You'll summon it from hell You know, I just that kind of show, you know, Gog manga VRE, you know like these shows that are just based on gag manga many of them and Translated into short episodes are just.

514
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:07,053
Speaker 0: they're really up my alley and I'm always looking out for them.

515
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:07,254
Speaker 0: now.

516
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:14,920
Speaker 0: when DMC first appeared I first found out about it because I download number one of every fan sub and I saw Detroit metal city.

517
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,508
Speaker 0: I said well got to download that.

518
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,100
Speaker 1: see I guess I already knew about it from Emily.

519
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,670
Speaker 1: But you know, there's live-action and the anime and the manga.

520
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically the deal is those is manga, right?

521
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,530
Speaker 0: And I think the manga is still going.

522
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:32,173
Speaker 0: I've read all five Currently published volumes in scans lation form.

523
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:48,845
Speaker 0: the scans lations weren't that great but I understood what was going on mostly because I had seen the anime and Studio 4c took the first two volumes of the manga and translated each and every chapter Directly to anime.

524
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:50,671
Speaker 0: this is a direct like.

525
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:55,119
Speaker 0: we were just talking about how remakes and other mediums How you can't make the exact same thing.

526
00:36:55,863 --> 00:37:00,383
Speaker 0: They came as close to making the exact same thing as you can possibly do right there the the at.

527
00:37:00,403 --> 00:37:11,779
Speaker 0: you watch the anime and hold up the chapter of the manga in front of you and every single panel is animated and they look exactly the same and they didn't animate anything that wasn't in a panel at basically at all.

528
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:14,940
Speaker 0: and No, no panel is missing from the animation.

529
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,292
Speaker 0: Well much and the dialogue is almost identical.

530
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:18,800
Speaker 1: much of it is animated in this.

531
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:31,053
Speaker 1: I don't want to say sparse but it's often it looks like a manga panel like you had this perspective of a scene and then they've kind of Animated the characters moving around within that one scene.

532
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:32,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like an animated manga panel.

533
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:45,347
Speaker 0: But so for example if there was a scene where someone's waving a guitar back and forth in the manga you see the person standing There with the guitar over their head and motion lines to indicate waving maybe a blurry guitar in three places Right and the anime.

534
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:53,577
Speaker 0: it's literally the same person standing in the same pose But the camera at the same angle and the screen is sort of cut off so you don't see any.

535
00:37:53,597 --> 00:37:54,580
Speaker 0: you know anything around them.

536
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:02,505
Speaker 0: That wasn't in the original manga panel and it is animate them waving the guitar back and forth while their mouth moves and a voice Actor reads the line,

537
00:38:02,745 --> 00:38:05,133
Speaker 1: but that's not to say the animation is cheap because

538
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:07,440
Speaker 0: a lot of the studio for see bitches

539
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:12,937
Speaker 1: The concert scenes and anytime they're kind of actually animating something as opposed to using

540
00:38:12,977 --> 00:38:13,237
Speaker 0: this.

541
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:14,060
Speaker 0: look at the opener.

542
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,965
Speaker 1: Yes There a lot of like.

543
00:38:15,985 --> 00:38:19,820
Speaker 1: the episode we just watched a little while ago was like the concert.

544
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,760
Speaker 1: They animated a good deal of concert and it would have been an awesome concert to be had.

545
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:27,052
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think it was great is out.

546
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:28,720
Speaker 0: Let us to spoil the episode, right?

547
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,651
Speaker 0: Well, let's tell the premise of the show.

548
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:32,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know make more sense.

549
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:35,979
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna read the plot summary from the anime news that come on.

550
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:42,410
Speaker 1: Detroit a metal city is a to Quickly rising independent death metal band.

551
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:47,229
Speaker 1: they garner fame by performing wildlife shows Songs filled with hate violence and rape.

552
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:47,369
Speaker 1: now.

553
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:49,800
Speaker 1: They say they're filled with hate violence and rape.

554
00:38:50,141 --> 00:39:01,357
Speaker 1: They're filled with the words hate violence and rape primarily rape and and hell if you are not down With people making fun of rape and rape related situations.

555
00:39:01,377 --> 00:39:02,040
Speaker 0: Well, it's weird.

556
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:07,806
Speaker 0: it's like on the one hand right you have, you know things like The works of Kazuko.

557
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:11,960
Speaker 0: Okay, where in some cases rape occurs and it's you know.

558
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,988
Speaker 0: It's like they're being a rape in a movie.

559
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:15,032
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's.

560
00:39:15,595 --> 00:39:16,880
Speaker 0: it's not making fun of rape.

561
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,309
Speaker 0: It's there's a story and there's rape in it and it's.

562
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,020
Speaker 0: you can tell legitimate stories where rapes happen, right?

563
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:37,120
Speaker 0: And then you have other Kazuko came Aga where there are just sort of gratuitous Unnecessary rapes that are not cool and you sort of you know It's hard to figure out what to do with those and you can make tasteless jokes about them.

564
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,794
Speaker 0: And you have things like rape man, which are just tasteless all around.

565
00:39:40,316 --> 00:39:47,225
Speaker 0: but in this This is I think the one You're treading very carefully.

566
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:47,967
Speaker 0: I know it's.

567
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:51,056
Speaker 0: it's like the way that rape is treated.

568
00:39:51,216 --> 00:39:57,817
Speaker 0: it's like even I Think that maybe even someone maybe because I obviously never been raped.

569
00:39:58,459 --> 00:40:13,060
Speaker 0: but If there was if there was a rape joke or a joke involving the word rape that a person who had been raped Could possibly in some universe laugh at if this is not it then it doesn't exist.

570
00:40:13,762 --> 00:40:19,319
Speaker 1: I think what might help though is that they use the English word for rape most of the time do they?

571
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:19,359
Speaker 0: I?

572
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:20,746
Speaker 0: Can't tell.

573
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:21,972
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

574
00:40:21,992 --> 00:40:29,640
Speaker 1: I use a lot of English words Yes, but basically the story is really about Nagishi show so itchy who is shoe each.

575
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:34,635
Speaker 1: Yes, a young guy fresh out of school wants to be musician.

00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:35,317
Speaker 1: He's pretty good.

592
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:33,138

595
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:44,980
Speaker 0: the thing is in that scene, right?

596
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,609
Speaker 0: It's like he's totally getting along with all the people who were hanging out there Except that his music is no good.

597
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,534
Speaker 0: cuz that's the thing.

598
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:52,660
Speaker 0: is he why he's a musician?

599
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,569
Speaker 0: He's actually good at singing and playing the guitar.

600
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,857
Speaker 0: The thing is when he plays the pop music.

601
00:41:57,897 --> 00:42:00,490
Speaker 0: He likes to play He's bad at it.

602
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:02,220

00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,419
Speaker 0: It's you know, the pot like the pop music he likes, you know to listen to like.

604
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:14,359
Speaker 0: well You keep mentioning like I don't know if it's a real pop singer or not, but like kahimi curry or whatever You know some pop singing girl who they made up for the show me.

605
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,005
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

606
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:19,413
Speaker 1: Most of the reason why I think he's lame is that Personality wise he is really lame.

607
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:22,531
Speaker 1: He's wishy-washy He doesn't stand up for himself.

608
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:26,669
Speaker 1: He's passive-aggressive He's kind of selfish and stalker II.

609
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:30,221
Speaker 1: he's just really not a great person kind of a no I don't know.

610
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:38,500
Speaker 0: He seems to you know, he seems like want good things like, you know, he wants you know, like his Like his brother to do well in school and he cares about.

611
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:44,000
Speaker 0: He cares about his family and he you know any he cares about you know, his friends.

612
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:52,420
Speaker 1: There is definitely this this darkness that is just waiting to get out of him because the darkness comes out quite often.

613
00:42:52,781 --> 00:43:00,259
Speaker 1: His real job the only job in music he could get is being the lead singer for a horrible death metal band Detroit Metal City.

614
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:02,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

615
00:43:02,085 --> 00:43:03,209
Speaker 0: It's you know to him.

616
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:04,693
Speaker 0: It's horrible death metal to us.

617
00:43:04,773 --> 00:43:11,661
Speaker 0: It's just sort of normal metal, you know, but We've been to many concerts that were harder than this Thing.

618
00:43:11,762 --> 00:43:20,182
Speaker 0: is this the way metal is portrayed in this show is sort of a stereotypical kiss sort of metal, you know, it's It's not.

619
00:43:20,242 --> 00:43:24,597
Speaker 0: it means a little harder than kiss and less partying but it's definitely that sort of.

620
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:25,380
Speaker 0: you know.

621
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:31,558
Speaker 0: Oh my god, people are in a costume and the people in the crowd are moshing it and they're saying hell and rape a lot It's scary.

622
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:34,047
Speaker 0: No, it's just you know, it's just music.

623
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:36,556
Speaker 1: That's out at the same time it I feel you know.

624
00:43:36,637 --> 00:43:38,829
Speaker 1: as a fan of metal I can't at least say that it.

625
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:50,599
Speaker 1: it takes a lot of the Things that are worth making fun of about metal and makes fun of them in a way That is funny to people who like metal, especially the best character in the show the president of the record label.

626
00:43:56,001 --> 00:44:05,353
Speaker 1: The way she motivates the band is she'll be sitting there and they start playing a song she'll be like, oh But warning we're gonna be kind of offensive for the rest of this show.

627
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:12,740
Speaker 0: It's weird how this show Basically by being so overt in its offensiveness is not offensive.

628
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:16,100
Speaker 1: It's actually kind of inoffensive because it's so offensive.

629
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:26,437
Speaker 0: yeah, it like neuters the offensive things they're saying by saying them in such an Immature cheap and shallow way that they carry no weight that they would usually care.

630
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:26,617
Speaker 0: but

631
00:44:26,657 --> 00:44:45,075
Speaker 1: like here's an example they're in the recording studio making a CD and he has to play his part and He plays it kind of okay and then the president walks in and kicks him in the balls and says and I'm quoting loosely Shit, fuck I can't get wet with that play something that'll make my cunt go crazy.

632
00:44:45,336 --> 00:44:45,717
Speaker 1: Fuck.

633
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:47,801
Speaker 0: Yeah Great.

634
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:50,364
Speaker 1: Yes, and she just never stopped.

635
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:59,073
Speaker 1: like, you know in those cute shows like characters will like blah blah blah blah blah Icarus or Blah blah blah blah blah like they have their weird little catchphrase.

636
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:00,880
Speaker 1: She just ends every sentence with fuck

637
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:12,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, like there was one time where they were like, okay we need suggestions where the band should do and one, you know, he's like I want pop music and you're just like Yeah, and then the other guy's like hey something something she's like, uh-huh.

638
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:19,971
Speaker 0: And then like the drummer is just like I really want you know Some some kind of food like some salmon or something.

639
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,100
Speaker 0: She's like fuck and the middle fingers like pops up.

640
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:25,706
Speaker 0: That was all she said to.

641
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:26,148
Speaker 0: that was just.

642
00:45:26,168 --> 00:45:29,101
Speaker 1: but the middle fingers pretty much always up It's just.

643
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:34,579
Speaker 0: it increases in intensity and she always has like a bottle of some sort of you know, alcohol.

644
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:34,980
Speaker 0: It's great.

645
00:45:36,684 --> 00:45:42,500
Speaker 1: In one episode she's got a bottle of Jim Beam and it's just like on the desk and she's clearly swinging from it.

646
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:46,015
Speaker 1: The next episode she's got a bottle of wild turkey.

647
00:45:46,437 --> 00:45:49,225
Speaker 1: great But it's like two episodes later.

648
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:50,269
Speaker 1: It's a bottle of Jack.

649
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:58,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, she just caused like spilling it all over herself But somehow she knows how to run the record company, even though she's completely insane.

650
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:04,687
Speaker 1: But the point of this show is that I mean what sums it up so that he you know He's the front man for this band.

651
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:05,773
Speaker 1: He's the lead singer.

652
00:46:05,793 --> 00:46:12,180
Speaker 1: He hates it But at the same time he has this deep down sense of pride in what he does.

653
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,175
Speaker 1: I think what we'll explain to you why the show is awesome more than anything is.

654
00:46:16,195 --> 00:46:21,280
Speaker 1: I think it's the second episode where He's trying to kind of distance himself from his work and he's trying to relax.

655
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:25,160
Speaker 1: So he goes out into the street and he's playing his lame crappy pop music.

656
00:46:26,896 --> 00:46:29,768
Speaker 0: And You know, no one's even paying attention to them.

657
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:32,035
Speaker 0: They're just walking by ignoring him, but he's happy.

658
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:43,040
Speaker 1: and then here's noise And he looks and there's this crowd of people and they're around some guy who's a fan of DMC And the guys like playing a song pretty badly and everyone's getting all pumped up.

659
00:46:43,222 --> 00:46:54,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's going like, you know He's basically got a guitar and he's going to did and he's going rape rape rape rape rape rape and every and all these people Start getting crowding around this guy with a guitar and a little amp going.

660
00:46:55,801 --> 00:47:00,580
Speaker 0: And meanwhile, he's sitting there playing his pop music trying to ignore them and no one's paying attention to him at all.

661
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:06,605
Speaker 1: But he starts to think like, uh, if I if I just was the real crowds Well, he's.

662
00:47:06,645 --> 00:47:09,320
Speaker 0: no he's like I'm the real thing and they're not paying attention to me.

663
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,409
Speaker 0: They're paying attention to that lame cover band over there.

664
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:11,971
Speaker 0: What the fuck.

665
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:20,520
Speaker 1: but then the crowd is like Telling him to be quiet because he's getting in the way of their enjoyment of this really lame concert and he loses it.

666
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:30,973
Speaker 1: So he puts on his Krauser costume and Krauser appears takes the guitar and Unleashes, you know, he's playing pretty wickedly but people don't believe it's really him.

667
00:47:30,993 --> 00:47:33,120
Speaker 1: They're like, but Krauser really be here.

668
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:33,806
Speaker 1: How could this be?

669
00:47:33,826 --> 00:47:35,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, it could just be someone in a Krauser costume.

670
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:44,780
Speaker 0: I mean if I put on a Gene Simmons costume, you know and I practice, you know learning to play some You know fight like five kiss songs go out into the subway and just start rocking out.

671
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:46,740
Speaker 0: No one's gonna believe it's him at all.

672
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:54,100
Speaker 0: And you know, so I would need to do something to prove that I'm him Like have sex with a thousand women and have an incredibly long tongue.

673
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:58,337
Speaker 1: So he whips out the patented ten rapes per second.

674
00:47:58,418 --> 00:47:58,739
Speaker 1: Shout.

675
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,686
Speaker 0: He basically says that one.

676
00:48:02,706 --> 00:48:03,609
Speaker 0: he has a lot of these.

677
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:11,399
Speaker 0: it's weird because in many ways the show while being a music show Sort of similar to Beck is also very similar to a shonen fighting show.

678
00:48:11,701 --> 00:48:17,000
Speaker 0: He has all these moves like special attacks that he uses like the crazy teeth guitar.

679
00:48:17,382 --> 00:48:18,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, like he plays teeth guitar.

680
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:20,275
Speaker 0: He plays guitar behind the head.

681
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:21,460
Speaker 0: That's also a special technique.

682
00:48:21,742 --> 00:48:22,385
Speaker 0: He has the.

683
00:48:22,747 --> 00:48:24,699
Speaker 0: was it the gold the demon?

684
00:48:26,341 --> 00:48:27,607
Speaker 0: What's it called the demon jewel?

685
00:48:27,627 --> 00:48:30,117
Speaker 1: Oh my god everyone in the audience.

686
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:35,220
Speaker 0: my god Transfers all their evil power to him and then he unleashes it in a giant loogie.

687
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:36,988
Speaker 1: Oh my god, but the did.

688
00:48:37,229 --> 00:48:45,146
Speaker 1: the demon jewel comes into play in The most horrifying way you can imagine Later in the show.

689
00:48:45,408 --> 00:48:46,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's got a bunch of special moves.

690
00:48:47,017 --> 00:48:50,182
Speaker 1: Oh my Moa Fashionable.

691
00:48:50,262 --> 00:49:00,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one special movie has is that he can say the word rape ten times in one second And he does that for one of the songs and of course the crowd is like it's really him.

692
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:02,519
Speaker 1: ten rapes Even we can do that.

693
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:10,036
Speaker 0: It's even a point in the manga where he sneaks up behind someone and he's not in his costume But he talks in the Krauser voice and he wants them to believe he's Krauser.

694
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:11,020
Speaker 0: She was like don't hurt.

695
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,406
Speaker 0: He's like don't turn around.

696
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:14,656
Speaker 0: They're like, oh my god, it's Krauser.

697
00:49:14,716 --> 00:49:15,620
Speaker 0: He's like, how do I know?

698
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,884
Speaker 0: It's really you could be faking.

699
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:19,413
Speaker 0: He's like I will say right?

700
00:49:19,433 --> 00:49:20,939
Speaker 0: He's like, how can I prove that?

701
00:49:20,979 --> 00:49:21,260
Speaker 0: It's me.

702
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,768
Speaker 0: He's like say rape ten times a second.

703
00:49:22,788 --> 00:49:24,840
Speaker 0: He's like he whispers rape ten times a second.

704
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,973
Speaker 0: Of course it's like oh, I know it's you I won't turn around.

705
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,508
Speaker 1: there's a plot of one episode Where he tries to kick it up to 11.

706
00:49:33,508 --> 00:49:38,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good episode starts bleeding In the manga, he gets it up to 12.

707
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,616
Speaker 0: What I'm not dying.

708
00:49:40,636 --> 00:49:45,597
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell you but Any more than that other than there are 12 rapes per second in the manga.

709
00:49:45,979 --> 00:49:56,165
Speaker 1: now this is where the show saw shines where it's just you know, You get the cut between his real life and his real life and you know He's kind of real personality.

710
00:49:56,185 --> 00:49:59,456
Speaker 1: and the Krauser personality and how he doesn't like being Krauser.

711
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:07,019
Speaker 1: He hates Krauser hates the band But yet he's still really really proud of how good he is at being Krauser because he's great at it.

712
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:13,045
Speaker 1: So he keeps having to prove to people how great Krauser is Even though he doesn't want to.

713
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:24,324
Speaker 0: he's also must be getting paid a lot of money to be Krauser at least relative to what it You know in a successful indie band gets because he doesn't really have to do any other jobs And he's always when he's not.

714
00:50:24,565 --> 00:50:30,286
Speaker 0: you know being Krauser you can hang out and do it every once and he like he's living in A very small apartment, you know.

715
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:34,160
Speaker 0: in Tokyo though and in one episode the president comes over.

716
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,960
Speaker 0: It is like you're living in this tiny fucking apartment.

717
00:50:36,423 --> 00:50:43,180
Speaker 0: You know what's wrong with you and he you know He has a reason for liking the small apartments where he lived in college and the guy who's the landlord.

718
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:45,520
Speaker 0: He's really friendly with him and he likes him and he's a cool guy.

719
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:46,239
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

720
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:52,585
Speaker 1: when the guy uncle she gay or whatever his name is the landlord got because the president decides to Metal up his life.

721
00:50:52,606 --> 00:50:55,258
Speaker 1: So she brings these two Cho Aniki looking guys over.

722
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:58,746
Speaker 1: Okay She basically forces him down.

723
00:50:59,047 --> 00:50:59,689
Speaker 1: I love this.

724
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:00,934
Speaker 1: This is the I guess present.

725
00:51:00,954 --> 00:51:02,720
Speaker 0: They're more hard gay than show Aniki.

726
00:51:03,262 --> 00:51:06,712
Speaker 1: this is kind of the perception that I guess Japanese people might have about.

727
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:11,671
Speaker 1: Americans are about marijuana, but Marijuana does not make people act.

728
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:13,500
Speaker 1: the way marijuana makes him act.

729
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:19,020
Speaker 0: Well, I think that was demonstrating that he didn't know how marijuana makes people act cuz he's a lame, you know.

730
00:51:19,141 --> 00:51:31,849
Speaker 0: So it was you know, I think it was actually accurate in showing Hey, this guy doesn't know is is totally you know, not doing any drugs or anything and he that he smokes the weed But he doesn't inhale it and then he pretends to get high.

731
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:34,620
Speaker 0: and it's showing you him pretending to get high poorly.

732
00:51:35,382 --> 00:51:43,200
Speaker 1: But I love the fact that they basically kidnapped the landlord and bring him into this crab and by the end He's like whoo Detroit Metal City.

733
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:47,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though he's like this old quiet dude who's kind of kind of cool.

734
00:51:47,515 --> 00:51:48,800
Speaker 0: Oh, it's like a friendly grandpa.

735
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:56,759
Speaker 1: The show is full of just memorable moments, I mean it's okay after all I'm a masochist.

736
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:00,518
Speaker 1: That was like the funniest moment in the show.

737
00:52:01,282 --> 00:52:02,666
Speaker 0: It was a pretty good moment right there.

738
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:07,560
Speaker 0: I mean, basically there's a guy who's part of the band capitalist pig.

739
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,880
Speaker 0: He's the capitalist pig right and basically he doesn't play any instrument.

740
00:52:11,021 --> 00:52:14,055
Speaker 0: He just wears like S&M gear and crowds.

741
00:52:14,115 --> 00:52:22,672
Speaker 0: he sits on the stage You know wiggling around and Krauser kicks him and beats him up during the show and then after the show he Apologizes to him like he's like, oh would I hurt you?

742
00:52:22,692 --> 00:52:23,155
Speaker 0: He's like.

743
00:52:23,195 --> 00:52:26,754
Speaker 0: no, it's okay I'm a masochist that you know, I like getting beat up whatever.

744
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:38,840
Speaker 0: and then you know because he you know, he in real life he feels bad about this guy that he kicks around all the time and He finds out that the guy is working at a convenience store and as a crush on a girl.

745
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:50,233
Speaker 0: So he tries to help him out and to make a long story short He fails to help him out and the guy ends up getting hurt, you know Because it's like oh he ruined his chances with that girl and the guy's like he smiles.

746
00:52:50,273 --> 00:52:51,276
Speaker 0: He's like it's okay.

747
00:52:51,677 --> 00:52:52,579
Speaker 0: I'm a masochist.

748
00:52:53,443 --> 00:52:57,339
Speaker 0: he likes it that the guy tried to help him and I ended up hurting him because he likes being hurt and

749
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:11,640
Speaker 1: Things just escalate and escalate like I'm not gonna ruin this one, but there's a point where maybe a concert hall catches on fire yeah, and Maybe people are trying to get out and maybe he has to take his wig off.

750
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:21,639
Speaker 1: But but people see it and the way the crowd what the crowd assumes is going on when he is taking his wig off Versus what is actually happening?

751
00:53:22,501 --> 00:53:23,869
Speaker 1: It's very fortune worthy.

752
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:24,935
Speaker 0: Oh very much.

753
00:53:25,096 --> 00:53:27,060
Speaker 0: Oh my god I think it is very good.

754
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:33,157
Speaker 0: The anime is only 12 episodes long and it covers I think about 24 manga chapters.

755
00:53:33,237 --> 00:53:34,100
Speaker 0: right now the fur.

756
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,700
Speaker 0: I said it covers the first two volumes of the manga.

757
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,865
Speaker 0: But there are a couple differences.

758
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:41,720
Speaker 0: the very first chapter of the manga not in there not at all, right?

759
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,463
Speaker 0: - there's.

760
00:53:43,483 --> 00:53:44,528
Speaker 0: - Oh mock is cuz.

761
00:53:44,569 --> 00:53:46,619
Speaker 0: every manga volume has no market at the end.

762
00:53:47,021 --> 00:53:48,788
Speaker 0: The first Oh makay is not in there.

763
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,395
Speaker 0: The second Oh makay is in there.

764
00:53:50,415 --> 00:53:50,978
Speaker 0: rim just saw it.

765
00:53:52,342 --> 00:54:02,112
Speaker 0: And also one of the chapters of the manga was moved from its original Sequence to the end of the entire anime series

766
00:54:02,132 --> 00:54:04,739
Speaker 1: much like Takashi real scale in initial D

767
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,425
Speaker 0: Yes, and for that was for dramatic effect because you need to end the anime series with you know Some sort of significant chapter.

768
00:54:11,445 --> 00:54:18,746
Speaker 0: so they just moved this significant chapter where something kind of cool happens to the end In volume three of the manga.

769
00:54:18,927 --> 00:54:19,931
Speaker 0: There's a tournament.

770
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:22,400
Speaker 1: I am NOT kidding you shown in fighting show.

771
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,920
Speaker 0: It is in many ways a shown in fighting show.

772
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:35,940
Speaker 0: But as soon as that the tournament ends the show and in fighting aspects diminish And they sort of go back to the back and forth, you know regular, you know, the the conflict.

773
00:54:36,743 --> 00:54:37,065
Speaker 0: It's weird.

774
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:39,314
Speaker 0: the show has three conflicts going on at once.

775
00:54:39,395 --> 00:54:45,012
Speaker 0: right you have The conflict of you know, this kid not kid.

776
00:54:45,052 --> 00:54:47,860
Speaker 0: This dude has a metal life and a non metal life.

777
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,879
Speaker 0: He's not metal, you know for real.

778
00:54:50,241 --> 00:55:08,250
Speaker 0: But he is metal for real and it's he's got this internal conflict with him and in his daily life between these two things His jaw is his professional metal life and his regular life, but in his regular life within that world He's a conflict of trying to get with his girl Right, and of course the metal comes in and interferes with that.

779
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,880
Speaker 0: on the other hand girls tried to destroy the metal, right?

780
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:23,140
Speaker 0: He's got conflicts within the metal world You know DMC versus other bands and DMC trying to make it big and when he MC Trying to you know get better concert.

781
00:55:24,684 --> 00:55:41,579
Speaker 0: But when he has to compete with the testicle girls this punk Anti-man all-girl band and when he competes with this hip-hop guy Right, and of course is you know, the fact that he's not really metal comes into play on that side, too.

782
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:58,486
Speaker 0: So that interesting sort of even though a lot of the Joe, you know Even though the show is hit or miss a lot of the time and the manga is really hit or miss, you know It's like wow that chapter was sort of lame or wow what happened in the chapter was sort of weird or annoying or Stupid or whatever.

783
00:55:59,168 --> 00:56:29,380
Speaker 0: other chapters are just like tremendous win and The fact that there are multiple Aspects and different things the show can lean on at different times is what saves it because in any given episode Even if you know something lame happens in one department There's awesome stuff going on like in the metal world and you're like, yes there's always something even in the badge or the worst chapters to grab on to and Even though it's the same joke over and over again It's like at when I first saw the show and first found out about it.

784
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:33,235
Speaker 0: I thought it was gonna be one of those things where okay, I get the joke.

785
00:56:33,496 --> 00:56:34,580
Speaker 0: I've seen the first episode.

786
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,746
Speaker 0: I don't need to watch anymore.

787
00:56:35,786 --> 00:56:37,233
Speaker 0: It's the same joke a hundred times.

788
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:44,878
Speaker 0: I Could probably watch and/or read every DMC ever even if it's not they make it at least eight episodes before.

789
00:56:44,898 --> 00:56:46,860
Speaker 1: the rape jokes are Not that funny anymore.

790
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,984
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like even though I can see the jokes coming a mile away and it's not that great It's not the greatest thing ever.

791
00:56:53,064 --> 00:56:54,208
Speaker 0: I could still go for it.

792
00:56:54,268 --> 00:56:57,760
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, it'll still be sort of funny and entertaining.

793
00:56:59,286 --> 00:57:00,720
Speaker 0: It's like and it's still good situation.

794
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,270
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll admit by about it.

795
00:57:02,391 --> 00:57:09,420
Speaker 1: right around episode eight I had started petering out for me because they just yeah, it definitely made the biggest rape joke like they made it.

796
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,664
Speaker 1: It was there nice.

797
00:57:10,724 --> 00:57:11,768
Speaker 0: That was a great episode.

798
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:15,380
Speaker 1: He has performed the greatest rape you're going to see in this show.

799
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:16,530
Speaker 1: It's over that is it.

800
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:25,100
Speaker 1: and yet They just keep making less funny rape jokes after that where I feel as if they'd moved on to another rape joke.

801
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:29,980
Speaker 1: No joke, that wasn't rape and they could have done better, but they kept making the rape jokes instead.

802
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:31,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

803
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,653
Speaker 0: you know if Peters around and is in sputters a little bit?

804
00:57:34,673 --> 00:57:40,760
Speaker 1: and the other thing I can say is that the Krauser antics parts are always a lot funnier than the his real-life part.

805
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:41,887
Speaker 0: I definitely got to say.

806
00:57:41,908 --> 00:57:48,020
Speaker 0: I also agree that You know the parts of the show where it's what's going on in the metal world.

807
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,512
Speaker 0: It's definitely the part of the show that I enjoy the most.

808
00:57:50,813 --> 00:57:52,220
Speaker 0: but when you get to the tournament, right?

809
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,946
Speaker 0: You're pretty much getting all that.

810
00:57:53,986 --> 00:57:55,833
Speaker 0: you're getting all just metal world.

811
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:57,419
Speaker 0: what's going on with metal, you know.

812
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:01,996
Speaker 1: And that's what I want because the legend of Krauser is all I really want to see evolving.

813
00:58:02,036 --> 00:58:03,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's kind of weird.

814
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:15,895
Speaker 0: it's like a lot of bands out there try to you know, either artificially or Not artificially create sort of like this mystical legend around themselves, you know Even the Beatles have sort of like, you know, they're all.

815
00:58:15,975 --> 00:58:17,985
Speaker 0: Paul is dead You know, what's the?

816
00:58:18,306 --> 00:58:27,400
Speaker 0: it's all like these secrets and mysteries and some sort of like, you know Magical history and if you like look through the CD be like the albums and the lyrics like this.

817
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:50,397
Speaker 0: maybe some story that's going on, you know, and That's a. that's a thing that a lot of bands especially metal bands will do and in this show One of the best things about it is they show how accidentally completely by accident not trying to They create this legend of DMC, you know They he wrote he killed his parents and raped their corpses and came from hell.

818
00:58:50,477 --> 00:59:05,875
Speaker 0: and you know all these things that Krauser has done, you know not are not true or they're partially true and It's just kind of cool how you start to think well Maybe you know the real bands in the real world to have these sort of legends.

819
00:59:05,915 --> 00:59:07,480
Speaker 0: Maybe they created them by accident.

820
00:59:07,662 --> 00:59:09,116
Speaker 0: Also, I don't know.

821
00:59:10,102 --> 00:59:17,040
Speaker 0: I just think it's kind of cool and kind of kind of clever sometimes how things that happen in the show Translate into the legend of Krauser.

822
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:21,974
Speaker 1: Yes, and the the big rape that I was talking about really plays into that.

823
00:59:21,995 --> 00:59:23,840
Speaker 1: of course, you know pretty much every.

824
00:59:24,483 --> 00:59:27,054
Speaker 1: They're all rapes at least for the first day of eight episodes.

825
00:59:27,074 --> 00:59:28,240
Speaker 1: It's not all rape.

826
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,727
Speaker 1: Well, there's the one five times.

827
00:59:29,787 --> 00:59:35,450
Speaker 0: It's just the word rape without any actual rapid Yes that you won't ever actually see a rape.

828
00:59:35,651 --> 00:59:42,952
Speaker 1: However things happen that cause Fans and people remembering events to think back and think wow.

829
00:59:43,253 --> 00:59:44,997
Speaker 1: He totally raped that blank.

830
00:59:45,659 --> 00:59:53,500
Speaker 1: Yeah He totally killed those cops because remember Krauser was a demon born from hell who killed it and raped his parents.

831
00:59:53,782 --> 00:59:55,533
Speaker 1: They don't really specify in what order.

832
00:59:55,855 --> 00:59:59,753
Speaker 1: as a child Yep, yeah, I gotta say this.

833
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:27,336
Speaker 0: I think the main thing about that I think the main thing is that while the show like It's like if you listen to like a real disgusting offensive metal band like say a cannibal corpse or something like that that this is like The fact that this is just sort of in a way parodying that even though it's still doing the offensive things Really it's sort of like being offensive with like, you know a squishy hammer.

834
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:31,063
Speaker 0: in a way It's sort of you know what I'm saying Plus the show.

835
01:00:31,244 --> 01:00:37,153
Speaker 1: watch this with a group of people because the more people are that are in the room with you The funnier it is all gonna be.

836
01:00:37,495 --> 01:00:37,797
Speaker 0: Yep.

837
01:00:37,998 --> 01:00:43,137
Speaker 1: Yep I would I would definitely have showed this at the anime club where I saw a hundred times a million.

838
01:00:43,177 --> 01:00:43,819
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

839
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:46,858
Speaker 1: In fact, I think I would have shown like one episode of it.

840
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,265
Speaker 1: Yeah at a time.

841
01:00:48,627 --> 01:01:05,949
Speaker 0: my recommendation to people is that you should watch You know all 12 episodes of the anime and if you really really like it like you're still you watch them all and you're still like feeling it then you can read the manga and Then there's gonna be a live-action movie or there is.

842
01:01:05,969 --> 01:01:14,819
Speaker 0: it's just not available in English in any way yet, you know, whatever I'm totally gonna watch that no matter what and but I can't say yes or no on it because I haven't seen it.

843
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,574
Speaker 0: But I'm gonna go out and get it ASAP just to see what the deal is.

844
01:01:18,594 --> 01:01:28,715
Speaker 0: because if it's a live-action Movie, they'll actually probably tell you know, like one cohesive story They'll actually be people in crazy costumes and that can be pretty fun.

845
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:32,405
Speaker 0: Even if it's not gonna be good But it is a good show.

846
01:01:32,445 --> 01:01:33,228
Speaker 1: I can say that much.

847
01:01:33,368 --> 01:01:39,130
Speaker 1: and the opening song while it's not the best song in the world Satsugai is pretty pretty catchy.

848
01:01:39,451 --> 01:01:40,275
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you.

849
01:01:40,636 --> 01:01:40,958
Speaker 0: look at it.

850
01:01:41,038 --> 01:01:45,745
Speaker 1: other shows It's not really death medley like while the lyrics are yes Well, it's not death metal.

851
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:49,240
Speaker 1: raise money rape your parents kill everybody murder murder.

852
01:01:49,661 --> 01:01:52,490
Speaker 1: But it sounds kind of Metallica ish.

853
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:54,115
Speaker 0: It's sort of normal metal.

854
01:01:54,155 --> 01:02:02,280
Speaker 0: It's not death metal, but the Other shows like look at like Beck I mentioned before and some others right that are about music.

855
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,440
Speaker 0: You know shows about music that are translated from manga.

856
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,632
Speaker 0: Right Beck was a manga that turned into an anime.

857
01:02:07,692 --> 01:02:18,925
Speaker 0: and you look in the manga There are music lyrics and then in the anime they actually have songs that match a lot of those lyrics pretty closely and Are all.

858
01:02:19,006 --> 01:02:21,435
Speaker 0: most of them are actually good songs or you know.

859
01:02:21,595 --> 01:02:31,120
Speaker 0: and in DMC They in the manga there are lots of lyrics to songs and in the anime They made songs that use the lyrics from the manga.

860
01:02:31,641 --> 01:02:51,392
Speaker 0: But the songs that they made aren't always good songs and you can tell that the quality of the songs was often limited because they had they were trying to stick to the original lyrics as they were in the manga and As such like only Satsu guy is sort of a you know Pretty good catchy opening kind of song.

861
01:02:51,693 --> 01:03:04,585
Speaker 0: they can get you a little bit energized but a lot of the other songs either come off as weird or They only like sing a very small part of those songs as they obviously didn't come up with an entire song To match the lyrics or whatever.

862
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:06,952
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's it's you know, it's alright.

863
01:03:07,032 --> 01:03:14,319
Speaker 0: the music will not bother you and If you like metal at all, you might actually, you know, like some of the music I don't know.

864
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of lame.

865
01:03:15,483 --> 01:03:17,309
Speaker 0: It's more about the jokes than about the music.

866
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:17,630
Speaker 0: Yes.

867
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:22,585
Speaker 1: I recommend this show to pretty much everyone Anyone anyone plus.

868
01:03:23,108 --> 01:03:28,007
Speaker 1: if you need any further prompting I have three words for you Detroit moe city.

869
01:03:28,288 --> 01:03:30,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's by far the greatest part.

870
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:35,560
Speaker 0: That was the one part that I refused to tell and I made rim watch it just before we did this.

871
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:40,848
Speaker 1: Oh my god, because it it almost in a way Epitomizes the true spirit of metal.

872
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:44,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the old makay from the end of the second volume of manga that you know.

873
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,940
Speaker 0: That was animated at the end of like I think the like tenth episode of the anime.

874
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:53,200
Speaker 0: They just stuck it on the end there and it that's that's really what I you know.

875
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,409
Speaker 0: Like it not just metal but all geekeries is like.

876
01:03:56,469 --> 01:04:00,240
Speaker 0: yes, that is you know, how even scary geekeries?

878
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:11,338
