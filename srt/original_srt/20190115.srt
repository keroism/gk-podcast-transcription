1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,666
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday January 15th 2019.

2
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,188
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:15,198
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:22,113
Speaker 1: tonight We are back to talk about the hot tabletop game root Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:25,466
Speaker 1: So something very important happened.

6
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:31,945
Speaker 1: I wad a bridge north of us was blown up The Tappan Zee bridge.

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,994
Speaker 1: yep now there was nothing wrong with it's weird.

8
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:38,383
Speaker 1: a lot of people kept saying like oh that bridge sucked like How?

9
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:42,760
Speaker 1: what was bad about it other than the fact that it's way too far north because of nonsense politics.

10
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:45,540
Speaker 1: So that bridge was old and falling apart.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,820
Speaker 1: But that didn't a falling apart, but it being old and falling apart never actually affected one's experience driving over it.

12
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:55,233
Speaker 0: There was mad traffic as didn't have enough lanes.

13
00:00:55,535 --> 00:01:01,540
Speaker 0: the new one I don't think it has significantly more capacity is twice as much and it has a bike lane and a pedestrian path.

14
00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:04,388
Speaker 0: But the old one was one bridge.

15
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:07,840
Speaker 0: the new one is two bridges each larger than the previous bridge.

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,319
Speaker 1: The thing is I am in no position to ever take advantage of that bike lane anytime soon.

17
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:13,588
Speaker 0: Why not just bike up there?

18
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,359
Speaker 0: It's a ways up as soon as it's warm.

19
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:17,499
Speaker 1: What's on the other side of it if you bike over it?

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,001
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

21
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:20,952
Speaker 0: on one side is Westchester and the other side is like Nyack?

22
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:22,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like Nyack to Piermont.

23
00:01:23,222 --> 00:01:24,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to buy.

24
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:27,750
Speaker 0: I've biked farther than that frequently.

25
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,220
Speaker 1: I would rather bike over the Verrazano Narrows bridge.

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,525
Speaker 1: That's the one I want a bike lane.

27
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:32,810
Speaker 0: Oh that bike that bridge sucks.

28
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,312
Speaker 0: It's tall.

29
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:34,356
Speaker 1: I'm into it.

30
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:37,500
Speaker 0: Yeah It's hard to bike over the Verrazano.

31
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:39,783
Speaker 0: We've both done it.

32
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:40,306
Speaker 0: It sucks.

33
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:40,969
Speaker 1: Yep.

34
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:42,234
Speaker 0: This bridge is not tall.

35
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:43,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a live stream.

36
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,264
Speaker 1: It got blown up.

37
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:47,080
Speaker 1: bridges blowing up is actually not that interesting to watch.

38
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:49,673
Speaker 0: So originally they were like, let's blow up the whole damn thing.

39
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,040
Speaker 0: then they're like, no, no, no, we'll hurt the fishes.

40
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:59,460
Speaker 0: So they were taking it apart one piece at a time slowly And then there and then using the pieces to make reefs for the fishes down near Rockaway and other places.

41
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:07,562
Speaker 0: But then they're like, oh no We were taking apart this one piece and we heard a really loud bet noise and we checked it and the structure might not be Too good.

42
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,774
Speaker 0: So if we take it apart slowly, it might just collapse.

43
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:16,040
Speaker 0: while we're taking it apart slowly So we're gonna have to blow up this one piece and then we can take it apart after it's fallen in the water.

44
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:20,220
Speaker 1: But no to be fair that bridge was an old piece of shit in terms of engineering.

45
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:23,232
Speaker 1: Maybe next they gotta work on the white stone in the frogs neck.

46
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:24,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, right those things are held up.

47
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:25,924
Speaker 0: They blow those up.

48
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:26,788
Speaker 0: that'll be something to say.

49
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:29,440
Speaker 1: those two are held up as far as I can tell entirely by paint.

50
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:39,500
Speaker 0: I feel like what they should do for the white stone and frogs neck Right is they should make new bridges that go straight across Yeah, and then make two more bridges in it because they're so close to each other.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,280
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, just make one two three and then get rid of the old two, right?

52
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,289
Speaker 0: Well make two get rid of the old two then make two new ones in an X shape so you could start at one end right.

53
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:53,920
Speaker 0: Make like an like a bow tie shape with four bridges with like loops at all the corners.

54
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:58,380
Speaker 0: That way you can start on like the white stone and an end on the other side of the frogs neck or vice versa.

55
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,088
Speaker 0: They're so close.

56
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:00,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're like.

57
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,539
Speaker 0: They're like, you know They might as well be next to each other.

58
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,219
Speaker 1: The only reason I ever used one or the other because one of them had more traffic than the other.

59
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,166
Speaker 1: one Like it was pretty random which one I ever used.

60
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:12,400
Speaker 0: I would choose based on where I'm going on the other side.

61
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,156
Speaker 0: So if I'm going northeast, I'm gonna use a frogs neck is a little further out.

62
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:18,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

63
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:21,634
Speaker 0: and If I'm going to like the baseball stadium, I'm using the white stone.

64
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:22,459
Speaker 0: cuz it's right fucking there.

65
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,488
Speaker 1: Yep I was usually going northwest.

66
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:25,795
Speaker 1: So I ended up using the white stone.

67
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:29,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know It's like where you're going is which one you're gonna use.

68
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,937
Speaker 1: Yeah, that geek night's quality content.

69
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:31,480
Speaker 1: You're looking for.

70
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:32,700
Speaker 1: We're back talking about bridges.

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,404
Speaker 1: We haven't done a show in a while because it was the holidays and we were all traveling and doing stuff and then it was Magfest.

72
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:38,787
Speaker 1: Yep.

73
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:40,459
Speaker 1: We had the New Year's party that we had to go to.

74
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:42,129
Speaker 0: We're going to pack south.

75
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:43,074
Speaker 0: So you're not getting another show.

76
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:43,758
Speaker 0: It's like next week.

77
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:44,641
Speaker 1: Yep We can.

78
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:48,694
Speaker 1: basically we can only fit in one show between all these cons and not too far.

79
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:52,105
Speaker 1: after pack south is paxis Kind of far out.

80
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:55,457
Speaker 0: you're gonna be getting shows in February and March.

81
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:56,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's far enough out.

82
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,400
Speaker 0: We will be doing shows and the rest of January you're gonna get shows.

83
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,468
Speaker 0: All right, Jen rest of January February and March.

84
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:02,190
Speaker 0: They'll be nice.

85
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:04,680
Speaker 1: So we are back from super mag fest.

86
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:05,789
Speaker 1: So I think it's worthwhile to.

87
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,072
Speaker 1: we don't.

88
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:12,060
Speaker 1: in the old days We would do a whole show on every kind we went to but go to a lot of cons not a lot changes.

89
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:15,430
Speaker 1: But there's always notable things to talk about for any big con we go to.

90
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,269
Speaker 1: so mag fest 2019 was better than Previous mag fests in a lot of ways.

91
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,979
Speaker 1: but mag fest has a problem that's starting to grow.

92
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:25,645
Speaker 0: Man, this has always had a problem.

93
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:26,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's getting worse.

94
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:28,094
Speaker 0: It's always been getting worse.

95
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:28,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's getting worse.

96
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:29,640
Speaker 0: worse, right?

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,180
Speaker 0: Well, I mean that's the thing with getting worse is that every time it's worse than the last time.

98
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,103
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

99
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:38,577
Speaker 1: mag fest is like the only non pax gaming con we like.

100
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:47,618
Speaker 1: like Magfest is better than the worst pax in terms of the attendee experience But it's not quite on the level of like a pax West.

101
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,800
Speaker 1: no But I really like mag fest and also mag fest is unique.

102
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:59,099
Speaker 1: Some of the things that mag fest you make mag fest unique are really awesome Like the panel content at mag fest like especially if you want like academic.

103
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:07,251
Speaker 0: Well, because mag fest is a nonprofit has to justify its nonprofit status So it does a lot of awesome things to justify its nonprofit status.

104
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:14,634
Speaker 1: like mag fest panels are mostly fan panels Non gaming or like just fun stuff or they're like really like.

105
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:16,059
Speaker 0: they're the kinds of panels that we do.

106
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,391
Speaker 1: There's other people doing the kind of stuff.

107
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:21,223
Speaker 1: We do at pax's at mag fest It's not just us.

108
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:22,649
Speaker 1: so the panels are great.

109
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,399
Speaker 1: Like I go to more panels at mag fest than I do at pax's.

110
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:30,053
Speaker 1: But what they don't have are like big serious industry panels.

111
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:32,380
Speaker 0: so much and a big serious industry presence at all.

112
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:40,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it is it is all fan all the time Which is both a pro anacond because like there's better content in many regards.

113
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,580
Speaker 1: But that content is often less polished a little more raw like pax will have a super polished panel.

114
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,885
Speaker 0: The industry came to mag fest.

115
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,310
Speaker 0: They'd be like we gotta shut this shit down.

116
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:50,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's cannot have.

117
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:51,237
Speaker 0: this cannot be.

118
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:54,993
Speaker 1: yeah Like mag fest you'll go to a fire mag fest.

119
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:55,776
Speaker 1: They'll go to a panel.

120
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:56,579
Speaker 1: That's really good.

121
00:05:57,121 --> 00:06:03,260
Speaker 1: But it's a little unpolished because the panelists are literally hungover or possibly still drunk from the night before.

122
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,684
Speaker 1: But I love mag fest.

123
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:15,292
Speaker 1: I love going to mag fest and generally like the arcade was rocking this year mag fest Traditionally had a problem where Thursday was pretty weak and Sunday was pretty weak.

124
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:18,100
Speaker 1: this year Thursday was a full-on goddamn day.

125
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually it's like I told people right show up to mag fest late Thursday.

126
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:22,557
Speaker 0: Nothing happens.

127
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:25,708
Speaker 0: early Thursday I got there and leave mag fest early Sunday.

128
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:28,618
Speaker 0: Everyone checks out of the hotel and then the whole place is empty.

129
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,240
Speaker 0: on Sunday There's no reason to hang around get home get home.

130
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got there at noon and like tabletops already bumping like there's already panels going.

131
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,772
Speaker 0: Yeah, so next year got to get to mag fest earlier on Thursday The expo Hall said it would open it too and it opened it too.

132
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was bumping and last year mag.

133
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:50,157
Speaker 0: Well, yeah last year at mag fest on Sunday morning tabletop was a hundred percent empty.

134
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:51,240
Speaker 0: It was just a ghost town.

135
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,847
Speaker 0: No one was there this year.

136
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:55,920
Speaker 0: It wasn't bumping on Sunday, but it was there.

137
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,620
Speaker 0: It was activity on Sunday and that was like the library was open.

138
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,465
Speaker 0: There were people there.

139
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:01,009
Speaker 0: would you could?

140
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:02,780
Speaker 0: you could play games in there on Sunday?

141
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,740
Speaker 0: There was also not feel like you were wasting your time or that you should have gone home like on Thursday.

142
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,479
Speaker 1: Sorry on the last day on Sunday when I went in the the arcade was still bumping and like I still had to wait In line to play DDR.

143
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:17,479
Speaker 0: You always have to wait in line to play DDR or initial D.

144
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,913
Speaker 1: The time where you don't have to wait in line to play DDR or initial D is between 5 a.m.

145
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:23,137
Speaker 1: And 10 a.m.

146
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,207
Speaker 1: That is the magic moment.

147
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:27,693
Speaker 0: All right, I'll try to wake up early.

148
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:31,087
Speaker 1: as I've said I remember last year I was like, well 2 a.m.

149
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,131
Speaker 1: It's too crowded.

150
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:36,689
Speaker 1: So if I wait till like 4 a.m There's no way anyone's playing DDR.

151
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:36,930
Speaker 1: Nope.

152
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,155
Speaker 1: There's still a line.

153
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:39,359
Speaker 1: good God people.

154
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:47,230
Speaker 1: But really the only problem with mag fest now like the fundamental problem The only thing that I have to say mag fest you got to do something about this.

155
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:53,535
Speaker 1: Is that there are way Way too few staff for that crowd.

156
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:54,600
Speaker 0: You can't get more staff.

157
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,160
Speaker 0: It's not possible as long as it from mag fest remains mag fest.

158
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:05,170
Speaker 1: Hey, well, I think they could but it's not my place to say because I am NOT staff at mag fest I don't officially represent mag fest.

159
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:06,720
Speaker 1: I am just a guest to mag fest.

160
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:08,779
Speaker 1: I show up to do panels and have a good time.

161
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:13,753
Speaker 1: But the fundamental problem however mag fest solves it is a thing that packs has got.

162
00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:15,738
Speaker 0: so saw it packs is not 24 hours.

163
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,732
Speaker 0: It's not you guys has money.

164
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:23,977
Speaker 0: It's not a non-profit But in order for mag fest to fix it It has to a stop being non-profit and B stop being 24 hours.

165
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:28,660
Speaker 1: I do think there are other ways to solve it because it's not get a lot of money from a generous donor.

166
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:36,168
Speaker 1: It's not just that they don't have enough staff because they have a lot more staff than people realize due to the nature of how they deploy their staff.

167
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:41,986
Speaker 1: the staffer and the way the stat like their staff uniform and like the Staff are largely invisible.

168
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:44,560
Speaker 0: They could make minor improvements in that regard.

169
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,091
Speaker 0: But because it's 24/7 you need so many more staff.

170
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,148
Speaker 1: But you need moves to those staff.

171
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:55,910
Speaker 0: like the problem time seems to be right to do the job I think about like one enforcer at packs.

172
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,700
Speaker 0: They do an eight hour shift each day, right?

173
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like okay at mag fest.

174
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,940
Speaker 0: You need three people to do the same job.

175
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,908
Speaker 0: Yep, because it's 24 hours packs in the back.

176
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:07,533
Speaker 1: when packs went till 2 a.m.

177
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:11,725
Speaker 1: We needed three full shifts Her day.

178
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:16,240
Speaker 0: Yep, and that fast when it needs like five or six shifts to packs is three.

179
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:25,973
Speaker 1: Yep, now they could get away with a lot less staff if they had the staff that they had were deployed a little more broadly and More importantly they have to be way more visible.

180
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:41,971
Speaker 1: because a big part of why packs has so many fewer problems of harassment and nonsense going on is that Even if there aren't a ton of enforcers like in an area doing stuff There's always an enforcer within eyesight pretty much anywhere you go.

181
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:49,490
Speaker 0: Like even if it's a little it's also less physically sprawling than All the packs is except for maybe West right.

182
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,559
Speaker 0: but in West it's like any if you're in any of the official packs areas.

183
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,311
Speaker 0: indoors There's enforcers about standing but there's.

184
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,080
Speaker 1: but as part of this is even mag fest fault.

185
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:06,920
Speaker 1: So for example mag fest did have a much better staff presence in the arcade Expo hall console free play like that area had a good as the main zone.

186
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:09,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, it had a good staff presence and they'd handled things pretty well.

187
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:23,240
Speaker 1: The problem is is one the general Convention Center area has if there are staff I literally never saw any and to Magfest is not responsible for having staff in the hotel lobby and bad shit was happening in that hotel lobby.

188
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,907
Speaker 0: Well, the hotel lobby is just an you know an area that's connected to mag fest.

189
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,332
Speaker 0: that has nothing to do with mag fest.

190
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:36,880
Speaker 1: the hotel needs to be on top of that and Mag fest needs to bring the hotel accountable to deal with harassers and like though there are panels in the hotel part.

191
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,277
Speaker 1: Oh, no I'm talking like the hotel lobby itself.

192
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,200
Speaker 1: Magfest can't like the staff aren't gonna maintain order in that area.

193
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:48,618
Speaker 1: The hotel seemed to be just turning a blind eye to it and there were harassing pieces of shit.

194
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:58,540
Speaker 1: It was mostly like I want to say 16 to 20 year old white dudes who were just like didn't even have mag fest badges mostly and we're just harassing people.

195
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,460
Speaker 1: And it didn't seem like anyone was on top of that.

196
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:15,131
Speaker 1: But other than that mag fuzz was great and like every other area of mag fest Stepped up its game like the arcade started on time because most of the staff of mag fest are Curating and managing the content of mag fest.

197
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:19,489
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there's you go to a panel room and it's like yeah There's people they're running the panel room.

198
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:21,320
Speaker 0: Yep, right you go to the arcade.

199
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,722
Speaker 0: There's people.

200
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:24,015
Speaker 0: they're fixing arcade machines to go to the tournaments as people.

201
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:24,840
Speaker 0: They're running tournaments.

202
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know go you go to a place in mag fest for this mag fest content and there are mag fest staff.

203
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:35,740
Speaker 0: We're running that content there just aren't excess mag fest staff just walking around.

204
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,313
Speaker 0: Yep, every mag fest staff member is like do it?

205
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,580
Speaker 0: you go to the the museum.

206
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:42,108
Speaker 0: There's mag fest staff in the museum running the museum.

207
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,774
Speaker 0: There's no mag fest staff.

208
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:45,460
Speaker 0: Just walking around the hallway being staff.

209
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:46,625
Speaker 0: They don't have people for that.

210
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:48,976
Speaker 1: Yep, and I think the shortest term solution would be mag.

211
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:53,707
Speaker 1: This needs like ten people Per eight hours.

212
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:56,980
Speaker 1: so spread that over 24/7 and make sure that you know feel like it breaks.

213
00:11:57,282 --> 00:12:07,248
Speaker 1: They need a dedicated group of people whose sole job is to wear a very visible IMA mag fest staff person shirts and just Walk slowly around and be visible.

214
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,630
Speaker 1: that alone would probably solve a huge percentage of mag fest remaining problems that are visible to the attendees.

215
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:21,503
Speaker 1: and in terms of the invisible problems who cares like Stack on staff just hides all that stuff and it's fine Right.

216
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:27,409
Speaker 1: I remember all the problems attendees never found out about back when I ran everything at Connecticut Mm-hmm, and that's that's right.

217
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:28,093
Speaker 1: That's how to do it.

218
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,660
Speaker 1: But mag this was a good time.

219
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,200
Speaker 1: We will definitely be back for super mag fest.

220
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,845
Speaker 0: Well, he's running mag fest.

221
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:38,480
Speaker 1: as long as mag fest stands we will be there because I see how long it stands.

222
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,123
Speaker 0: What's the over under?

223
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:40,289
Speaker 0: I love this shit.

224
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,851
Speaker 1: I think mag fest can survive the long run Mm-hmm.

225
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:50,060
Speaker 1: I think it's the thing that the biggest danger to mag fest is probably beyond mag fest control and it's the same thing.

226
00:12:50,100 --> 00:13:00,040
Speaker 1: That's a danger to all nerd stuff big mass shooting big Incident like the incident that happened at ALA that anime con that we're gonna talk about on our next Wednesday show the fire.

227
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:10,659
Speaker 1: Yeah we're basically One of those shitty harassing dudes set a bunch of cars on fire in the con parking lot Because he was mad that a girl he was stalking wouldn't talk to him.

228
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:14,391
Speaker 1: Essentially, yep shit like that is a big danger.

229
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:15,354
Speaker 1: I'm really shocked.

230
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,440
Speaker 1: incidents like that have not happened more often.

231
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:21,955
Speaker 1: They do happen but big ones haven't happened as much as I expected.

232
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:28,655
Speaker 1: it's gonna happen someday Mm-hmm, and I don't know what the con world as a whole is gonna do when it happens.

233
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:30,883
Speaker 1: metal detectors are not the answer I point out.

234
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,940
Speaker 1: this is one area where mag fest is objectively superior to packs.

235
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:39,161
Speaker 1: mag fest does not have security theater or metal detectors and probably Neville never will Mm-hmm.

236
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:42,980
Speaker 1: I really really am disappointed that packs has these bullshit metal detect.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you think it's like mag fest probably needs if it wasn't theater.

238
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:53,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I could art you it's argue that mag fest needs it more than faxed us being half music festival half gaming con.

239
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:57,900
Speaker 1: If any nerd thing needed metal detectors that were real, it's mag.

240
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:01,391
Speaker 1: Yet mag fest is the one con that's doing it right.

241
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:04,400
Speaker 1: if they're not gonna have they're not gonna have fake security.

242
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:09,460
Speaker 1: They're gonna have no security or the right amount of security, but they're not gonna have fake security.

243
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:13,291
Speaker 1: That's one area where packs I think has deeply failed us is the fake security.

244
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:23,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there is so much game industry news centered Specifically around Activision Blizzard that we can't even talk about all of it.

245
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,692
Speaker 1: There's too much and it's all evolving like a lot of it.

246
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:28,820
Speaker 1: We don't even know all the details yet, right?

247
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,596
Speaker 0: So the trigger I think is the Moreheim the CEO of Blizzard.

248
00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:33,519
Speaker 0: This was a while ago.

249
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,184
Speaker 0: There's a lot.

250
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:38,168
Speaker 0: he announced he was leaving but now he's actually Really left like he gone.

251
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:42,726
Speaker 0: Yep, and I think because of that it's like, alright now The whole boat is gonna get turned over.

252
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:46,379
Speaker 0: you got CFOs getting like kicked out like one or two of them.

253
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:50,091
Speaker 1: Yeah for and it's like one of them ended up at Netflix.

254
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:51,074
Speaker 1: It's not really like.

255
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:53,080
Speaker 0: it's not some kind of shenanigans going on.

256
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:57,119
Speaker 1: So it's not yet clear Why these people left?

257
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,600
Speaker 1: Specifically if they left because they were leaving or they were pushed out, right?

258
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:05,700
Speaker 0: Some suggestions though.

259
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,478
Speaker 0: No proof because it's you know, HR private info that like the one who went to Netflix was like kicked out for bad.

260
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,992
Speaker 0: You know behavior and it's like Netflix.

261
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:19,770
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be you know, people were like, hey Netflix Why are you hiring this person who had was badly behaving right?

262
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,456
Speaker 0: There were some suggestions of that.

263
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:22,560
Speaker 0: who knows if it's true?

264
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, no idea.

265
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:27,984
Speaker 0: Don't call me with your lawsuits of Slander or whatever.

266
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:32,720
Speaker 1: Yep, but the Moreheim leaving was interesting partly because Moreheim.

267
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,463
Speaker 1: Yeah, Moreheim.

268
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:34,527
Speaker 1: I've never met him.

269
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,676
Speaker 1: I don't know really a lot about him.

270
00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:37,580
Speaker 0: He's the blizzard guy.

271
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,739
Speaker 0: He's like the number one other guy, but basically the has been until now.

272
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,582
Speaker 0: now He's not a blizzard guy.

273
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:46,295
Speaker 1: all the statements about like his leaving are just super neutral generic.

274
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:48,542
Speaker 1: Like he is leaving Period.

275
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:51,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, really read what gaming sites have to say about it.

276
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:54,120
Speaker 0: Now ESPN has to say maybe you'll get more info.

277
00:15:54,341 --> 00:16:03,433
Speaker 1: Yep, according to the filing submitted this week on Monday He's leaving the company on April 7th Like he's actually leaving right because when he announced his departure he was then.

278
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:09,759
Speaker 1: but then this is typical in many companies He stuck around as an advisor for various, you know ease the transition, etc.

279
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:14,932
Speaker 1: There was no news release accompanying the filing which simply read.

280
00:16:14,952 --> 00:16:18,904
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read the entire filing short as Previously disclosed.

281
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:28,560
Speaker 1: on October 3rd 2018 Michael Moreham entered into an agreement with a blizzard Yeah, Moreheim pursuant to which he would provide strategic advice to the company in an advisory capacity.

282
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:33,901
Speaker 1: Anyway, employment to the company will conclude on April 7th 2019.

283
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:34,745
Speaker 1: Full stop, right?

284
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:35,106
Speaker 1: That's it.

285
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:38,137
Speaker 0: And also so in somewhat related news.

286
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:43,560
Speaker 0: There was this Unemployee of blizzard who's working in the Hearthstone eSports department, right?

287
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:59,860
Speaker 0: wrote this big like story of how awful their job was and how you know It drove them to be have so much stress and be depressed and contemplate suicide And all this stuff and our HR didn't do anything and how blizzard presents itself as one of those companies that's doing it.

288
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,121
Speaker 0: Right.

289
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:02,449
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, we're inclusive.

290
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:02,971
Speaker 0: Look at us.

291
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:08,670
Speaker 0: We're not evil like those bad game companies But on the inside still is not near perfect.

292
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:09,252
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

293
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:11,839
Speaker 0: So it's just an account by the employee.

294
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:15,719
Speaker 0: You can go read it for yourself and gather from it what you will.

295
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:19,558
Speaker 0: I read the whole thing because it was actually written somewhat compelling way.

296
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:23,019
Speaker 1: Yep I'm linking to the variety article, but there's a lot of articles about writing.

297
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:26,400
Speaker 0: Okay, so that's also in here in the blizzard shakeup, right?

298
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, and on top of that you got the newest news, which is sort of a double news.

299
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:31,460
Speaker 0: news.

300
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,506
Speaker 0: Number one is that you know Activision Blizzard.

301
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:38,562
Speaker 0: they brought Bungie in when after it got booted out of Microsoft or left Microsoft or whatever Happened there.

302
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:43,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and they got the so and then they went through all the trouble of getting destiny and to battle net.

303
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,745
Speaker 0: So it's like you're looking there.

304
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:49,482
Speaker 0: It's like Warcraft Starcraft our stone Destiny Right.

305
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:50,044
Speaker 0: It's like what's that?

306
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:50,947
Speaker 0: What is?

307
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:52,132
Speaker 0: one of these is not like the other.

308
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:53,075
Speaker 0: right.

309
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,930
Speaker 0: and now They kicking did the bungee out.

310
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:58,620
Speaker 0: It's like I went through all the trouble bringing it in.

311
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:01,047
Speaker 1: What what's really happening?

312
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:04,096
Speaker 1: Are they kicking bungee out or is bungee escaping Activision?

313
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:05,380
Speaker 0: I don't know what's happening.

314
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:08,156
Speaker 0: It seems like that, you know, there's so many shakeups going down there.

315
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:08,960
Speaker 0: Who knows what the hell?

316
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm back.

317
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,873
Speaker 1: We were talking about like bungee and what's their deal?

318
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:20,114
Speaker 0: because as Scott said well You don't know bungee is the company that made marathon which was an FPS for the Mac.

319
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:26,412
Speaker 0: all the people on Windows and DOS had Wolfenstein doom and quake right the Mac people had marathon.

320
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:27,756
Speaker 1: I never played marathon.

321
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:33,690
Speaker 0: marathon was Basically like slightly better than doom and nowhere near quake.

322
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:37,060
Speaker 1: I literally never knew anyone who played marathon.

323
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:41,274
Speaker 0: Anyone had a Mac had marathon because it wasn't on PC.

324
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:41,495
Speaker 1: what?

325
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:44,886
Speaker 1: and remember this is 1994. so who had a Mac in 94?

326
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:57,408
Speaker 0: and then ironically the people who made the Mac FPS ended up going to Microsoft to make Halo the windows, you know xbox FPS Oddly enough before marathon there.

327
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,796
Speaker 1: I didn't realize they made operation desert storm.

328
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:00,860
Speaker 0: I never heard of it.

329
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:03,138
Speaker 0: I mean I heard of the actual operation desert.

330
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:08,997
Speaker 1: Yeah I thought it's not a game of the same name and a minotaur labyrinths of Crete and pathways into darkness.

331
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:11,948
Speaker 1: 91 92 93 and then marathon 94. right marathon marathon.

332
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,476
Speaker 1: So, I mean full disclosure.

333
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:22,411
Speaker 1: I Never liked any game bungee made but I think they're good at like.

334
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:28,320
Speaker 1: destiny and halo are very good at being What they are like if you like that kind of game.

335
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,064
Speaker 0: I've also never.

336
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:41,260
Speaker 0: I have also never been a fan of any bungee game other than marathon But I respect which I played because when I went to schools and summer camps They usually had max and they usually had lands and we could play a marathon in land mode.

337
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,850
Speaker 1: See, I just remember when halo came out.

338
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:50,660
Speaker 1: all I could think was wow That is really sad compared to every PC FPS that I already play.

339
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:52,006
Speaker 1: Like what is this game?

340
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:55,260
Speaker 0: and well people who only had consoles in the US mostly?

341
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:03,683
Speaker 0: Yeah, who had played Goldeneye, which was worse than also When gold and I came out all I remember thinking was wow Goldeneye came out.

342
00:20:03,723 --> 00:20:05,229
Speaker 0: We had quake one quake two.

343
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:09,663
Speaker 0: We're like, wow, what's up with that Goldeneye, but and then when Marathon came.

344
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:11,571
Speaker 0: Oh, no when halo came out.

345
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:13,239
Speaker 0: It's like we got quake three and counter-strike.

346
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,899
Speaker 0: Yep What's with this halo garbage?

347
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,860
Speaker 1: But if you didn't have if you weren't a PC gamer cuz back then PC gaming was not like even today.

348
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,426
Speaker 1: It's not that accessible though back then.

349
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:23,811
Speaker 1: It was really not accessible.

350
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,638
Speaker 0: So at least in the u.s.

351
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,106
Speaker 0: Other countries They only had PC gaming.

352
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:29,520
Speaker 1: but basically like I don't like these games.

353
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,340
Speaker 1: But these games are very important to gaming and are very well made in the US.

354
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:35,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think anyone.

355
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:38,559
Speaker 0: I don't think Bungie even today has like audience outside the u.s.

356
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,744
Speaker 0: It's it's right.

357
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:43,640
Speaker 1: what I've gathered even in places any is mod is pretty popular outside of the u.s.

358
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I mean even in places that do consoles like Japan, I don't think they're playing but he wasn't good.

359
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,044
Speaker 0: Ah, I don't know what that is.

360
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:51,127
Speaker 1: You don't remember Oni.

361
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:52,410
Speaker 0: Let's show me a picture.

362
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:54,115
Speaker 1: You probably remember Oni.

363
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,344
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

364
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:57,194
Speaker 1: It's gonna remember Oni.

365
00:20:57,295 --> 00:21:00,364
Speaker 0: I don't know The box art.

366
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:01,750
Speaker 0: I remember that wasn't.

367
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,296
Speaker 0: it wasn't just a third-person action.

368
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:04,160
Speaker 0: walk around hit things game.

369
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:05,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never actually played it.

370
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:06,359
Speaker 0: I don't know.

371
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:10,493
Speaker 1: But yeah, so a lot of the gaming press like the.

372
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:11,758
Speaker 1: the undercurrent is that?

373
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,340
Speaker 1: Activision has the worst reputation of the Activision Blizzard Bungie.

374
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,093
Speaker 0: Why can't we go back to the Activision that published pitfall for the Atari 2600?

375
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:19,655
Speaker 0: That's my Activision.

376
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,265
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the good Activision.

377
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:24,713
Speaker 1: It was all down from there ever raid.

378
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:27,502
Speaker 0: That's good Activision right there To.

379
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,589
Speaker 0: even then it was still good good Activision yet.

380
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:33,320
Speaker 1: Shockingly River Raid holds up better than you would expect.

381
00:21:35,482 --> 00:21:39,634
Speaker 0: But I mean Activision published mech warrior - right that was still good Activision in those days.

382
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:40,296
Speaker 0: are 90s right mid 90s.

383
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, these you know that activism went to poop.

384
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:49,147
Speaker 1: So on top of all this Investors into Activision Blizzard.

385
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:49,869
Speaker 1: full disclosure.

386
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,979
Speaker 1: I own a. I own a decent amount of Activision Blizzard stock.

387
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:01,859
Speaker 1: Investors are launching a possible fraud like there's a fraud investigation around the bungee split.

388
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:02,802
Speaker 0: Why?

389
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:05,931
Speaker 0: because they invested because bungee came in and how bungees leaving.

390
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:10,970
Speaker 1: so there because I own some stock and I work in finance I don't want to comment on this at all.

391
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:12,480
Speaker 0: Okay, so don't I'll comment.

392
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:18,587
Speaker 0: So I guess they're accusing them of fraud to say I guess the argument would be I bought your stock Because you were getting.

393
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:24,440
Speaker 0: you told me bungee was coming in Right, and now they're going out and now the stock price went down.

394
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,843
Speaker 0: That's you.

395
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:27,569
Speaker 0: you lied to me, right?

396
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,014
Speaker 0: I didn't get what I was paying for.

397
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:29,536
Speaker 0: I'm mad.

398
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:30,680
Speaker 0: And so I'm suing.

399
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:37,403
Speaker 1: Yep, essentially and variety variety had all the good articles about this, but there's an article about this Specifically.

400
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:43,299
Speaker 0: you can read and they get and then when they go to court They'll probably like you said this during the earnings call and it's not true.

401
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,130
Speaker 0: That's probably the kind of stuff that they're gonna go for right?

402
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:48,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, there's all sorts of nonsense.

403
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:52,657
Speaker 0: This is in your annual report, but look reality bungee gonna bye-bye.

404
00:22:52,817 --> 00:22:56,580
Speaker 0: Yeah So it's about your stock based on false information.

405
00:22:57,283 --> 00:23:06,799
Speaker 1: This is the kind of stuff that happens when false or misleading info a bunch of Separate game companies each of which is good at what they do end up being together in the same company.

406
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:18,420
Speaker 1: and all of this is happening in parallel with the Massive rise of eSports where actually I think Blizzard is doing the most prudent thing.

407
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,568
Speaker 0: Well, they're actually so for hearthstone.

408
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:26,219
Speaker 0: They completely restructured the way hearthstone eSports works this year Yeah, and drastically and they haven't even announced all of it yet.

409
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,731
Speaker 0: It's gonna be nothing like it was last year, right?

410
00:23:28,752 --> 00:23:30,520
Speaker 0: Who knows what the hell's gonna happen with overwatch League?

411
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:33,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, but oh also a side news.

412
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:37,079
Speaker 0: Overwatch League did one thing a small thing but a big thing.

413
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:41,470
Speaker 0: Small small in scope but large in effect.

414
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,215
Speaker 0: now that no sports league.

415
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,658
Speaker 0: I know of not even like NFL.

416
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:48,587
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Right, I had a Gomer Gator coming at me.

417
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:50,071
Speaker 0: that is fantastic.

418
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:52,980
Speaker 0: They made a single page that you can go to a web page.

419
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,710
Speaker 0: That's just a web page a small thing.

420
00:23:55,113 --> 00:24:10,540
Speaker 0: that web page lists every instance of Overwatch League players being suspended reprimanded Punished why they were punished what their penalty was in, you know, the whole history of everything all the players have done bad.

421
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,340
Speaker 0: Can you show me like a page that's publicly accessible?

422
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,417
Speaker 0: That's like every NFL player all the fines and suspensions they got all year forever, right?

423
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,645
Speaker 0: No, there's no such thing right.

424
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:24,440
Speaker 0: show me the list of like all the hockey players who got fined or suspended this year.

425
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,210
Speaker 0: How much what it was for right?

426
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:27,438
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't exist right?

427
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:27,820
Speaker 0: not eat?

428
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,706
Speaker 0: Not at least not available to the general public.

429
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:33,520
Speaker 0: I'm like one easy-to-use page, but for Overwatch League, they got it.

430
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,845
Speaker 0: Good job a plus.

431
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:40,429
Speaker 1: so along those lines something really funny happened and I'll say This will be the last news.

432
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:42,039
Speaker 1: then we'll get into route that you're all waiting for.

433
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:46,240
Speaker 1: So we one of our magfest panels like we put the YouTube video out.

434
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:49,522
Speaker 1: It's there and it was the top 40 games You should play.

435
00:24:49,743 --> 00:25:04,169
Speaker 1: like the 40 games you should play and one of the ones we said was overwatch because it is the modern incarnation of like action quake 2 and weapons factory and TFC and like all those other games like it's the It's the iteration of that kind of game that is playable today.

436
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:04,671
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

437
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:06,958
Speaker 1: And this Gomer Gator came into my mentions.

438
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:09,838
Speaker 0: hard Mm-hmm, and they're like just block them.

439
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:14,060
Speaker 1: So because because they're because they followed the template and it was pretty funny.

440
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:23,590
Speaker 1: but basically I discovered based on this Gomer Gator that a ton of Shitty people are really mad that they're.

441
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:28,597
Speaker 1: they have been banned from overwatch because they were harassing people outside of overwatch.

442
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:39,445
Speaker 1: Because blizzard in turn not in just an eSports thing But they will go after people like they're pro players who do shitty things Even outside of the game.

443
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:42,274
Speaker 0: blizzard is doing a thing where you they're gonna.

444
00:25:42,655 --> 00:25:47,851
Speaker 0: I think it's a. I'm not sure if it's a hundred Percent implemented yet, but the story I heard was to go.

445
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:53,009
Speaker 0: it you'll be watching say some overwatch League on Twitch Yep, and you want to chat in the chat room.

446
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,760
Speaker 0: You have to have in order to chat in the chat room.

447
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,688
Speaker 0: They got like a plug-in that will prevent you from chatting in the chat room unless you have your battle net account Connected to your twitch account with Oh off.

448
00:26:02,848 --> 00:26:05,900
Speaker 0: so if it means then you can chat in the chat room.

449
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:10,153
Speaker 0: But if you say some racial slurs say for example, they can now.

450
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,440
Speaker 0: they now have your battle net account.

451
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:13,968
Speaker 1: They don't just ban you from the twitch chat.

452
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:14,129
Speaker 1: Now.

453
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:16,220
Speaker 1: They ban you from playing overwatch, right?

454
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,940
Speaker 0: They could just ban you from battle net and all you lose all your blizzard games.

455
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:25,500
Speaker 0: But won't people just like make a separate battle net free account because the accounts are free and use that for twitch chatting

456
00:26:26,063 --> 00:26:26,926
Speaker 1: Another actual

457
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:33,251
Speaker 0: account where they bought a thousand dollars of skins and Crates when they not use that one for twitch chatting,

458
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,657
Speaker 1: so I'm not a hundred assuming

459
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:35,280
Speaker 0: they're intelligent.

460
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:40,684
Speaker 0: But as best I can tell, you know, they're probably not that smart if they're racial slurring but you get the idea.

461
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:48,173
Speaker 1: the best I can tell is that if you are banned and Blizzard identifies that you have another account and it's actually yours.

462
00:26:48,494 --> 00:26:50,160
Speaker 1: They'll ban them all they have to find them though.

463
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:58,966
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I if I made a separate account called like rim Yeah, and I use the VPN to go on Twitch How would they ever know that?

464
00:26:59,006 --> 00:26:59,267
Speaker 0: that's?

465
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:01,335
Speaker 0: you know, what my real battle net account is.

466
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:08,640
Speaker 1: Yep, but It appears to be working because a lot of gummer giddy shitheads are really really mad about this.

467
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,917
Speaker 0: I mean you can get suspended from school if you're robbed liquor store.

468
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,058
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

469
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:21,285
Speaker 1: so a GDQ 2019 just happened.

470
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:25,260
Speaker 1: It was a. it was an a-plus hype.

471
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:28,056
Speaker 1: I Really enjoyed the first.

472
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:35,370
Speaker 0: the only thing the only negative thing I can say about the most recent a GDQ No, was that I was less impressed with the prizes.

473
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:38,147
Speaker 0: They're usually there's some prizes that I want.

474
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:43,610
Speaker 0: the grant I usually pay like I usually donate the amount to qualify for the grand prize, even though I know there's no chance to win.

475
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,876
Speaker 0: I'm donating what do I write?

476
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:47,510
Speaker 0: but because the grand prize is still something like man.

477
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,778
Speaker 0: It would be cool to have that yo, right this year.

478
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,910
Speaker 0: The grand prize was kind of admittedly amazing.

479
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:57,282
Speaker 0: It was like this replica Master Sword like to scale plus Hylian shield.

480
00:27:57,603 --> 00:28:07,898
Speaker 0: that was like super legit like Wow And definitely was more valuable than the amount you had to donate to qualify which I think was 250 But I only donated a hundred.

481
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:08,381
Speaker 0: cuz like.

482
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,747
Speaker 0: I really don't need that master short.

483
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:11,336
Speaker 0: if I got the master What was I gonna do with it?

484
00:28:11,538 --> 00:28:13,068
Speaker 0: I'd probably eBay and donate the money.

485
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:14,352
Speaker 0: It's like.

486
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:18,310
Speaker 0: it's like what I'm gonna do with a fucking master sword not yourself with it, right?

487
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,552
Speaker 0: It's like they didn't have you know in the past It would.

488
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:22,584
Speaker 0: I would always be like, ooh, I want that this time.

489
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:29,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Scott Imagine a younger you where the want swords meter is still really high.

490
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:40,670
Speaker 0: Thankfully young Scott did not have two hundred and fifty dollars to donate Only maybe like fifty dollars, but one of the AGQ 2019 speed runs stood out above and beyond me and rim.

491
00:28:40,911 --> 00:28:42,417
Speaker 0: So I've side haven't seen all the runs.

492
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:47,492
Speaker 0: obviously there could be a better one, but me and rim of the runs Unanimously agree.

493
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:59,250
Speaker 1: Lord my best run of the week was my comment appears to be one of the top comments because basically Right after because I didn't watch this one live, but I caught it live and then I watched it again.

494
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,756
Speaker 1: I caught the tail end of it live.

495
00:29:00,796 --> 00:29:02,102
Speaker 0: show someone else how good it was.

496
00:29:02,162 --> 00:29:04,010
Speaker 1: and as soon as they YouTube I watched it.

497
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,082
Speaker 1: I've watched it two and a half times now.

498
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:08,453
Speaker 0: Well, you watch it more than me Time more.

499
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:12,690
Speaker 1: my comment on YouTube on this video will say literally everything needs to be said.

500
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:16,360
Speaker 1: He is the most entertaining runner in AGDQ history, that's true.

501
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:19,610
Speaker 1: quote there ain't no quiet time in this run.

502
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,296
Speaker 0: That's right.

503
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:25,209
Speaker 0: and quote god damn So big up shoutouts to grandpa and grandma.

504
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,142
Speaker 0: Genesis, dr.

505
00:29:27,203 --> 00:29:34,985
Speaker 1: Fatbody has injected a new level of hype and Just amazing commentary.

506
00:29:35,005 --> 00:29:35,589
Speaker 1: He is.

507
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:40,310
Speaker 0: It's not just that he is right cuz you I could go to GDQ and be hype.

508
00:29:41,032 --> 00:29:43,240
Speaker 0: You know, I have that skill at least to some degree.

509
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,990
Speaker 0: maybe not as much as the master fatbody but I could do that.

510
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:50,385
Speaker 0: He had the hype and he was pulling off the sub pixel frame.

511
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:52,388
Speaker 0: perfect tricks left and right Yep.

512
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,788
Speaker 1: and meanwhile You know cuz a DDQ like there's a culture and the culture up to this point all the runs have a similar cadence.

513
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:03,030
Speaker 1: like they're doing The thing the couch is talking and then the runner will be like, all right time for the quiet.

514
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:11,849
Speaker 0: And the thing is when the run started he brings out this enormous couch full of people and I got this vibe of oh It's like one of those anime panels with too many people on it.

515
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:15,670
Speaker 0: He's even got a guy on a webcam on a laptop on the couch.

516
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:21,225
Speaker 0: He's busy on the virtual couch and I'm like, oh no, I'm like, I'm like, oh, oh.

517
00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:24,101
Speaker 0: and then within five seconds I'm like, oh, yeah.

518
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:29,366
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah He takes a slower strat at one point to hit something because I do this for my little.

519
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:36,874
Speaker 0: he crashes the game Because it's funny because he just to show you that it's a thing even though it costs time and then goes back to the beginning Level select screen.

520
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:38,340
Speaker 1: it was the best balance.

521
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,641
Speaker 1: I cuz.

522
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:45,124
Speaker 1: I do enjoy runs that are like a Super technical like for our run where the the commenter is literally.

523
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:46,770
Speaker 1: just let's explain this glitch.

524
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,758
Speaker 1: Let's explain this sub pixel nonsense.

525
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:57,452
Speaker 1: This run was the perfect balance of amazing display of skill coupled with amazingly entertaining Situation.

526
00:30:57,552 --> 00:31:00,223
Speaker 0: I would say if you want someone to like introduce them to like.

527
00:31:00,263 --> 00:31:00,745
Speaker 0: why do it?

528
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:02,030
Speaker 0: why does everyone watch this GDQ?

529
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,918
Speaker 0: Why do they raise two million dollars every year?

530
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:04,762
Speaker 0: What's the deal with this?

531
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,269
Speaker 0: This is your first run to go to?

532
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, go for this run.

533
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:08,640
Speaker 0: the second run out if you.

534
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:09,484
Speaker 0: if not this one.

535
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:10,550
Speaker 0: there was one.

536
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:13,070
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was the last summer games done quick.

537
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,772
Speaker 0: I think it was.

538
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,157
Speaker 0: if not, it was the one before.

539
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,967
Speaker 0: that was definitely last year where they did a strider run.

540
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:19,813
Speaker 1: Oh Yes,

541
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:36,010
Speaker 0: Strider and the guy doing it had never done it before but someone was sitting next to him teaching him how to do it And this dude he was a speedrunner but it never speedrun any a Strider in his life and They taught him the speedrun and then made him do it himself and it's like a five-minute run.

542
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:41,770
Speaker 0: So it's not a big deal and that is like the perfect intro for anyone watching to the world of speedrunning.

543
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,463
Speaker 0: Yeah, and like how do you learn a speedrun?

544
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:44,088
Speaker 0: How do you do it?

545
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:56,050
Speaker 1: Right like imagine if up until this point like you go to the PGA Tour and everyone gets quiet on the important putt and then Someone walks up and they're about to golf and they're just as good as everyone else like they're a contender and they turn around.

546
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,420
Speaker 1: They're like everybody allowed before I make this putt.

547
00:31:58,601 --> 00:31:59,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone is good.

548
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:03,255
Speaker 1: Hey gonna make the putt This speed you gotta watch this.

549
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:05,242
Speaker 0: I think the rules of golf actually disallowed that.

550
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:11,346
Speaker 1: yeah, you probably but dr Fatbody has elevated the bar of AGDQ commentary.

551
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:11,828
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

552
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:13,439
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

553
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,209
Speaker 1: What's your thing of the day?

554
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:20,230
Speaker 0: So, you know how y'all, you know go to museum right and they're like, oh such and such is restored, right?

555
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,064
Speaker 0: They restore stuff at museums, right all kinds of old artworks.

556
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:24,210
Speaker 1: Oh, that's your thing of the day.

557
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:25,450
Speaker 1: I saw that tab open.

558
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:36,330
Speaker 1: I didn't realize you sent it to me cuz I had it open myself already cuz I was saving it to be a day later, you know, you know Restoring, you know historic artworks, you know sculptures paintings, right?

559
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:40,365
Speaker 0: But it's like you unless you do that or unless you're in the museum business.

560
00:32:40,546 --> 00:32:41,550
Speaker 0: It's like wait a minute.

561
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,850
Speaker 0: I actually had no idea how they restore a thing like right how what what do you actually do?

562
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:49,221
Speaker 0: Right, like what is the physical process?

563
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:49,804
Speaker 0: What happens?

564
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:50,869
Speaker 0: Here's a guy.

565
00:32:51,695 --> 00:32:53,890
Speaker 0: He works at Baumgartner restoration.

566
00:32:53,890 --> 00:33:01,682
Speaker 0: I think it's like his company and his job is restoring artworks and There's a lot of videos on his channel showing him restoring mostly paintings.

567
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:05,323
Speaker 1: and after I found the video you're linking to I watched Like ten of his videos.

568
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:05,970
Speaker 1: They're really good.

569
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:15,586
Speaker 0: But this one is a really good one because the painting is a painting on a piece of paper that is glued to a piece of wood and is ridiculously old and grody.

570
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:18,816
Speaker 0: and he You're like, what are you gonna do?

571
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:22,170
Speaker 0: like imagine me trying to restore this painting like what do I do clean it with?

572
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:25,762
Speaker 1: He's like, I gotta I gotta move the wood.

573
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:27,590
Speaker 0: I gotta get the paper off the wood.

574
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,545
Speaker 0: It's just like imagine I can't even get a sticker off something.

575
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:32,712
Speaker 0: I bought an Amazon Right.

576
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:35,502
Speaker 0: This guy's gonna get a piece of paper with a painting on it.

577
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:38,871
Speaker 0: That's glued to an ancient piece of wood Right.

578
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:49,269
Speaker 0: Anyway, so he's got this painting which is the assassination of Archimedes, which is an awesome frickin painting actually And he takes it from its grody state and restores it to a magnificent state.

579
00:33:49,289 --> 00:34:03,218
Speaker 0: is It's a lot like watching those knife sharpening videos and you get that same feeling of like ah the cleaning and the restoring ah, but also a fascinating explanation of the process and what goes into it and A plus to this whole channel.

580
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:03,741
Speaker 1: Yep.

581
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:05,552
Speaker 1: One of the other ones I watched It's the.

582
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:10,594
Speaker 1: I think it's the restoration of the Mother Mary, which is another one that's on wood But he doesn't.

583
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:12,181
Speaker 1: he wants to leave it on the wood for reasons.

584
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:20,190
Speaker 1: He talks about why but Anyway, he starts and he's like so I'm starting with the face and normally professionals do the face last because it's the most important part.

585
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:25,596
Speaker 1: But this video will be more entertaining if I start with the face and also I'm really good at this So that's not gonna be a problem.

586
00:34:25,636 --> 00:34:29,330
Speaker 0: Also he has to like touch up the paint and he's like, yeah We got this erasable paint.

587
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:30,175
Speaker 0: It's like.

588
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:37,348
Speaker 0: I'm like what he's like if someone in the future decides that you know I didn't do a good job because like he's like obviously not trying to paint over any of the.

589
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:37,909
Speaker 0: the paint.

590
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:40,385
Speaker 1: It's not like that famous Jesus that the lady messed up.

591
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:41,270
Speaker 1: real bad, right?

592
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:52,190
Speaker 0: And he's you know, he's just trying to fill in the blanks as closely to what the real artist did right, you know Taking instructions from the person who owns the thing who's paying for him his services, right?

593
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,234
Speaker 0: So it seems like the bike.

594
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:53,614
Speaker 0: he's like.

595
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:53,917
Speaker 0: he's like.

596
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:55,382
Speaker 0: I always use erasable paint that way.

597
00:34:55,402 --> 00:35:00,330
Speaker 0: if someone buys this painting in the future And then doesn't like what I did they can erase it and do a different different thing.

598
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:04,563
Speaker 0: So the theme without without erasing the paint from the original original.

599
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:06,890
Speaker 1: I want to try a new thing Grebel's style the.

600
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:12,240
Speaker 1: So regardless of what our things that they are I think we can always come up with a theme based on what we both pick.

601
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:23,362
Speaker 1: the theme this week was or this episode Masters displaying the height of their craft In the meta moment the book club book that we haven't gotten there.

602
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:24,527
Speaker 1: cuz we've been busy as 2001 a Space Odyssey.

603
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:27,662
Speaker 0: I said we would read it and I lied.

604
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:28,306
Speaker 0: I was wrong.

605
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:29,050
Speaker 0: We did not read it.

606
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,009
Speaker 0: Haven't read up any pages of it since I said that I've been too busy.

607
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:32,873
Speaker 1: Stay tuned.

608
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:34,158
Speaker 0: way too much shit going down.

609
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:35,343
Speaker 1: None of you read it either.

610
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:36,789
Speaker 1: I know you didn't.

611
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:38,935
Speaker 0: Someone has someone.

612
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:41,103
Speaker 0: the thing is I feel like people are either.

613
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:43,090
Speaker 0: I don't feel like there's people like us listening.

614
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:49,517
Speaker 0: I feel like the listeners who care about book club read it right away and listeners who don't care about book club Don't read.

615
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:50,809
Speaker 0: I found a lot of their bed.

616
00:35:51,171 --> 00:35:53,785
Speaker 0: The people I've talked a lot of people like us who read.

617
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,071
Speaker 0: eventually people Don't.

618
00:35:55,493 --> 00:36:00,231
Speaker 1: the people who really care about our book club don't tend to check what we're doing now and read it because they know our History.

619
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:03,020
Speaker 1: instead they'll go into the archive of the book club.

620
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:06,310
Speaker 1: pick a book that look good read it and then listen to that episode.

621
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,836
Speaker 0: That's good because at least you're reading.

622
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:10,285
Speaker 0: as long as you read books you get an A+.

623
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:11,470
Speaker 0: if you don't read you get an F-.

624
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:13,217
Speaker 0: There's not like a lot of in-between.

625
00:36:13,317 --> 00:36:16,149
Speaker 0: even if you read eventually like we do you still get the A+.

626
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:18,275
Speaker 1: So we were just at magfest.

627
00:36:18,315 --> 00:36:19,579
Speaker 1: We did three panels there.

628
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:23,370
Speaker 1: one of them, which is a brand new panel is already on YouTube.

629
00:36:23,471 --> 00:36:24,096
Speaker 1: I'm gonna link to it.

630
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:25,467
Speaker 1: You can just go watch it right now.

631
00:36:25,488 --> 00:36:30,787
Speaker 1: Wow The other two panels will be on YouTube at some point in the near future.

632
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:31,370
Speaker 0: That's good.

633
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,650
Speaker 0: We're gonna record at least a panel at PAX South and put that online.

634
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,087
Speaker 1: Yep, I don't think we're gonna record learn and win Carcassonne because we already did that.

635
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:39,770
Speaker 1: We already did it.

636
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,294
Speaker 1: We don't need another video of it.

637
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:43,220
Speaker 0: No, we'll just concentrate on teaching Carcassonne.

638
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,624
Speaker 1: Yep, but that one's online.

639
00:36:44,644 --> 00:36:55,210
Speaker 0: So also We were supposed to do this towards the end of last year and I told rim about it months in advance But he still didn't make time even though I was on vacation all week.

640
00:36:55,711 --> 00:37:07,050
Speaker 0: So after we got back from magfest no or just before yeah after he got back from magfest We recorded judging anime by its cover which somehow this show has lasted like over a year.

641
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,818
Speaker 0: I guess we actually it's really fun to do.

642
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:11,630
Speaker 0: we're keep doing it even though it's you know, whatever.

643
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:14,770
Speaker 0: But yeah, we did it for the winter at season of anime.

644
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:20,210
Speaker 0: There's already like two episodes out of most of the shows for the season of anime, but we haven't seen any of them.

645
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:28,469
Speaker 0: So we still we're doing a pre affair pre judging and I guess that's kind of okay because once I upload it I've only got a little bit of work to do.

646
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,072
Speaker 0: Hopefully I'll do it tonight and get uploaded tonight if I can if not tomorrow No.

647
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:45,342
Speaker 0: and then Once that's up You will be able to see our pre judges of the anime coming out this season and there's some good stuff coming - they'll be like Two or two maybe even three episodes for you to just watch right away.

648
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,149
Speaker 0: If you something we talked about sounds good.

649
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:51,182
Speaker 1: And last and least well not least this weekend.

650
00:37:51,223 --> 00:37:59,781
Speaker 1: The reason there's gonna be no show on Thursday We are gonna be at Pac South where we mention that already we are going to do two panels But specifically the new one.

651
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,350
Speaker 0: So we're doing learn to win Carcassonne.

652
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,766
Speaker 1: We talked about that and we're doing a new one nostalgia versus game design.

653
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:05,510
Speaker 0: It's rims idea.

654
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,878
Speaker 0: I'm not too hyped on it, but I get a free badge.

655
00:38:07,878 --> 00:38:11,030
Speaker 0: 40 games was also rims idea and I wasn't too hyped on it.

00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,893
Speaker 1: I was hyped on it.

657
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:13,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're hyped on anything.

658
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:14,985
Speaker 1: I there have been panels.

659
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:16,290

674
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:08,190
Speaker 1: It's terrifying because remember there were time there were old days where we go to an Otacon and do like a panels.

Speaker 0: All right, what people waiting for we're now?

699
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,830
Speaker 0: we're gonna talk about route for the rest of the show.

700
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,597
Speaker 1: Yep, Scott has finally played route.

701
00:40:23,778 --> 00:40:25,023
Speaker 0: Well, I played it many times.

702
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:26,630
Speaker 0: I played it at least three or four times.

703
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:28,110
Speaker 1: Yep, I've played it a bunch of times.

704
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,823
Speaker 0: I can't remember was I've either been green twice.

705
00:40:31,044 --> 00:40:33,079
Speaker 0: if I've played it four times I was green twice.

706
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:39,690
Speaker 0: if I played it three times I was green then I was the raccoon and then I was the otters.

707
00:40:40,132 --> 00:40:43,310
Speaker 1: I've been the woodland Alliance and I've been the birds multiple times.

708
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:48,525
Speaker 0: I get the idea of how the birds work though I don't know the super details because I haven't been the birds.

709
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:49,530
Speaker 1: the birds are so fun.

710
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:57,809
Speaker 0: I only vaguely get the idea of how the cats work because I've seen I've played against the cats every time but I've never been the cats and I know nothing about the lizard folk.

711
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:01,270
Speaker 1: I Didn't even read the rules about the lizard folk.

712
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:05,566
Speaker 0: I know nothing about the lizard folk other than that.

713
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:06,490
Speaker 0: There are lizard folks.

714
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,279
Speaker 0: So here's the deal and that's supposedly they're not.

715
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,590
Speaker 1: that good route is the new hotness.

716
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,824
Speaker 1: It came out last year in 2018 and it like sold out immediately.

717
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:14,687
Speaker 1: It keeps getting reprinted.

718
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:17,344
Speaker 0: It's unplugged It's sold out even sold out of the raccoon plushies.

719
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:25,102
Speaker 1: Yep the vague the vagrant plushies vagabond route got Real real big and popular in a hurry.

720
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:27,310
Speaker 0: It is popular big time.

721
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:33,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's interesting for a number of reasons because if I had to the before we talk about what root is Like.

722
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:40,158
Speaker 1: you have to understand that the designer of root is Cole Worrell And if you don't know who that is from letter games.

723
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:54,728
Speaker 1: all the other games that Cole Worrell is done are the ridiculous weird nonsense historical games that we play almost as Experiments like John company or an infamous traffic which Scott hasn't played.

724
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:57,915
Speaker 1: but you should Pax Pamir which I haven't.

725
00:41:58,055 --> 00:41:59,259
Speaker 0: Oh, what are the Pax ones?

726
00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:01,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, you played Pax Pamir.

727
00:42:01,165 --> 00:42:03,896
Speaker 0: I think no, I've paid Pax Porphyriana.

728
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:04,865
Speaker 1: Oh porphyriana.

729
00:42:05,168 --> 00:42:08,641
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, those kinds of games old

730
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:16,790
Speaker 0: crusty war games that you would only expect Someone with a long beard and a large belly and a broken chair to take off the shelf at the game store

731
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:17,674
Speaker 1: but not the

732
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:24,115
Speaker 0: ones that are on the shelf near the Napoleon's and the the Rommel's Right in the back.

733
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:25,160
Speaker 1: They're not war games.

734
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:28,351
Speaker 1: Like here's a bunch of chips that represent the Rommel's.

735
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:44,270
Speaker 1: these are more like here is a detailed simulation of the opium trade in China and you play European shitbags who are trying to literally buy fancy hats to increase their social standing and the terrible cost to China.

736
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,614
Speaker 1: Right and the opium trade.

737
00:42:45,794 --> 00:42:54,290
Speaker 0: basically any game that this person made other than root is something you would never get on any table Of normal non crusty gore gamer.

738
00:42:54,752 --> 00:43:06,470
Speaker 0: You know grog nard players our friend Chris will bring these to the table and I love these games But they are an acquired taste right mostly because as we've now learned the theme of them is crusty.

739
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,141
Speaker 0: Root is just another one of those games.

740
00:43:10,302 --> 00:43:12,430
Speaker 0: It isn't really mechanically different at all.

741
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:21,473
Speaker 0: It's just that they put cute animal forest critters on it instead of putting crusty old war generals on it Or crusty old.

742
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:23,097
Speaker 1: literally there's no war involved.

743
00:43:23,177 --> 00:43:24,801
Speaker 1: It's just training opium, right?

744
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:38,668
Speaker 1: So this game root is a combination of a highly political Extremely asymmetric kind of war game where literally every player is playing with completely different rules.

745
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:40,133
Speaker 0: There's.

746
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:43,150
Speaker 0: there are a few rules you share in common with other players, right?

747
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,674
Speaker 0: Which is that?

748
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:45,347
Speaker 0: like you're just trying to get to 30 points?

749
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,390
Speaker 0: It's like the default victory condition get to 30 points and win.

750
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:56,690
Speaker 0: Yeah but you and the default rules are like if you Do something on the board like every piece of cardboard on the board you you hit gives you like a point.

751
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:58,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's like true for everyone.

752
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,430
Speaker 0: But like everyone has similar like combat fighting rules because you can just fight your dudes.

753
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:10,250
Speaker 1: But like one faction gets points by building things on the board another faction gets points by just selling things in their shop.

754
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:12,562
Speaker 1: Yep, another faction gets points.

755
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:13,246
Speaker 1: They're just.

756
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:13,930
Speaker 1: they're not a faction.

757
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:24,087
Speaker 0: They're one dude Just one raccoon wandering around in the woods and they get points for helping other people or potentially just fucking Murdering people in the night or just getting items.

758
00:44:24,348 --> 00:44:26,999
Speaker 1: Yep One of the factions is a lizard called.

759
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,642
Speaker 1: I don't know what they do.

760
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:28,567
Speaker 1: I've never read their rules.

761
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:29,029
Speaker 0: I don't know.

762
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:34,003
Speaker 1: So it's it so like everyone's playing with these completely different rules.

763
00:44:34,024 --> 00:44:35,690
Speaker 0: It's like you're playing your own game.

764
00:44:36,057 --> 00:44:42,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, right You just happen to be on the same board and the only thing you share in common with the other players Is that board.

765
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:42,842
Speaker 0: we're like.

766
00:44:42,882 --> 00:44:44,149
Speaker 0: the rules are all the same.

767
00:44:44,872 --> 00:44:46,057
Speaker 0: Right like that raccoon guy.

768
00:44:46,077 --> 00:44:47,041
Speaker 0: It's like you're at your whole.

769
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:53,970
Speaker 0: your whole game is controlling this one, dude But if you fight you're a dude, yep now the game's not super complex.

770
00:44:54,351 --> 00:44:57,884
Speaker 1: Most of the people who say it's complex have just never actually played a complex game before.

771
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,410
Speaker 0: I think it's complex for normal people.

772
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,990
Speaker 1: It's complex for normal people a lot.

773
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:05,990
Speaker 0: It is definitely above the heads of a lot of people but it is not above the heads of someone who was a nerd who?

774
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:11,644
Speaker 0: Can listen to a geek nights, but I've also realized having played it You can go to a gaming convention.

775
00:45:11,664 --> 00:45:12,650
Speaker 0: it is not above your head.

776
00:45:12,852 --> 00:45:13,770
Speaker 1: Well, here's the more important thing.

777
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:23,130
Speaker 1: The reason so many people think it's so complex is that it is a very difficult game to teach Simply by the fact that it's so asymmetric.

778
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,997
Speaker 0: Yes, you teach this game.

779
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:29,596
Speaker 0: you have to teach like if you got three players, yeah It's like you teach three games.

780
00:45:29,616 --> 00:45:32,850
Speaker 0: you to teach someone how to be the the the woodland alliance.

781
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,809
Speaker 0: You gotta teach someone how to be the cats and someone had to be the birds.

782
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:51,190
Speaker 1: So my advice to you if you want to play this game is to regardless of any other circumstance even if you don't like to read the goddamn rules yourself to understand how to play and Force the people you want to play with to read the rules themselves.

783
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:56,241
Speaker 0: and the other thing is that once you've learned one or two of the the You know the.

784
00:45:56,262 --> 00:46:00,039
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, I was able when I played the otters.

785
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,224
Speaker 0: I'd never played them before.

786
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:02,890
Speaker 0: I didn't get a new rules explanation.

787
00:46:03,312 --> 00:46:08,010
Speaker 0: All I did was pick up the otter card, which is this the trading otters the river traders.

788
00:46:08,492 --> 00:46:09,375
Speaker 0: They sell stuff right.

789
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:11,020
Speaker 0: and I just started reading the card.

790
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:24,437
Speaker 0: I had already played the game two or three times as other Races and reading this card just reading it I 90% knew how to play the otters because I had played a few times before and I can read Right, and then I just had.

791
00:46:24,558 --> 00:46:35,210
Speaker 0: I only needed an explanation of these details That I probably could have got if I had read every single word on the card instead of just reading You know the major important words in the card.

792
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:44,669
Speaker 1: So we've got this like asymmetric political like kind of crazy game But it's skinned with the cutest animal art my favorite art in the whole game.

793
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:44,950
Speaker 1: Okay?

794
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:45,492
Speaker 1: I'm curious.

795
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:49,630
Speaker 1: is the card with the bunny Bank bunny Bank the bun the better Borough Bank?

796
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:56,495
Speaker 0: Yes, the bunny Bank as the cutest bunny inside the bank is the bunny that's in the bank is like hey money I think for me.

797
00:46:56,635 --> 00:46:57,377
Speaker 1: It's the one.

798
00:46:57,518 --> 00:46:58,942
Speaker 0: it's the given a second carrots.

799
00:46:59,103 --> 00:47:02,196
Speaker 1: birdie bindle is really good already been on my bed But there's one.

800
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:03,789
Speaker 0: not a lot of bad art at all.

801
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:06,043
Speaker 0: But there's one card and the people's are way good.

802
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,230
Speaker 0: all the meeples are way good, too.

803
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:11,710
Speaker 1: It's the rabbit ambush card where the rabbit rise the rabbits rise up and kill all the troops.

804
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:18,488
Speaker 1: Cuz it's just these really cute little rabbits like hey, but there were a little cloaks and they've just got this big fucking bomb.

805
00:47:18,788 --> 00:47:21,438
Speaker 1: Yeah This game is so cute.

806
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,210
Speaker 0: So alright, so that's another the race.

807
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:25,182
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the real deal with the game.

808
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,630
Speaker 1: Let's talk about like how it plays out, right?

809
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:38,065
Speaker 0: So you got this map and the maps depending on which races you got in the game Right that you're gonna deploy you dudes onto the map Right, and then you're gonna take turns and on your turn based on who you are.

810
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,490
Speaker 0: Your turn is completely different.

811
00:47:39,692 --> 00:47:41,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, right what you do on your turn?

812
00:47:42,252 --> 00:47:49,412
Speaker 0: Usually you have some sort of you know Actions you can take of various kinds and different ways of paying to take the actions You know.

813
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:54,390
Speaker 0: any actions usually involve moving dudes fighting, you know getting stuff there.

814
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:58,244
Speaker 0: You have cards and the cards are multi-purpose cards have text on them.

815
00:47:58,264 --> 00:47:58,926
Speaker 0: that does stuff.

816
00:47:59,207 --> 00:48:04,770
Speaker 0: you can like build Cards, you can use cards to profess to pay costs of certain actions.

817
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:08,190
Speaker 1: Oh, the screenshot has both birdie bindle and better bureau bank on it, right?

818
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:11,110
Speaker 0: You can get some cards, you know by doing certain actions.

819
00:48:11,311 --> 00:48:16,630
Speaker 0: Sometimes draw a card will be an action right and you got to pay for those actions using various resources.

820
00:48:16,731 --> 00:48:19,045
Speaker 0: Sometimes cards are the resource used to pay for the action.

821
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:19,810
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

822
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:24,670
Speaker 0: So, of course, you know everything I said was super vague because every race is super different, right?

823
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:29,110
Speaker 1: So the high level like we'll go through the races and kind of explain their high level deal, right?

824
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:33,066
Speaker 0: So the first one you got to learn about is the red one the maquis de cat.

825
00:48:33,126 --> 00:48:37,863
Speaker 0: the maquis de cat Which is like he's basically like the Empire right?

826
00:48:37,883 --> 00:48:39,890
Speaker 0: He starts with cats all over the board.

827
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's got his whole economy going on.

828
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,868
Speaker 0: He's got this giant castle, right?

829
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:49,030
Speaker 0: He's like deploying like all these wooden structures around and you know building stuff.

830
00:48:50,152 --> 00:48:52,108
Speaker 0: I'm not sure how the cat wins cuz never been the cat.

831
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:57,110
Speaker 1: Okay, whenever I see that it's hard for the cat to win when everyone's skilled, right?

832
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,383
Speaker 0: It's like whenever I've played I've only played against the cat and the cat's always been there.

833
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:04,000
Speaker 0: and the feel I get from the cat Is they start spread out all over the board.

834
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,870
Speaker 1: They start strong and slowly decline.

835
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:13,921
Speaker 0: They slowly decline as basically everyone else is playing races that come on to the board Right, like all the birds start in one nest and spread out right.

836
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:24,214
Speaker 0: the cat starts out like a blanket over the whole thing And then everyone rises up and pushes them back, but they're still pretty strong because they're all you know, they're the marquee They're like the Empire.

837
00:49:24,555 --> 00:49:25,157
Speaker 0: so they still.

838
00:49:25,418 --> 00:49:33,930
Speaker 0: they participate in a lot of combat a lot of making sure other people don't win Right while also building up resources and doing whatever their thing is.

839
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:38,725
Speaker 1: So imagine like a big Empire that starts strong is beset by all sides.

840
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:49,581
Speaker 1: think like Rome almost And slowly collapsing, but they can win by consolidating their power Holding all these enemies at bay and making the red alliances to eventually.

841
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:55,023
Speaker 0: they definitely need alliances because if everyone goes against them they got Nothing, I guess it's true of anything in a political game.

842
00:49:55,143 --> 00:49:55,425
Speaker 0: demo.

843
00:49:55,445 --> 00:49:57,715
Speaker 1: weasel in the chat points out That's the card we all forgot about.

844
00:49:58,077 --> 00:50:00,687
Speaker 1: mouse in a sack might be the cutest card.

845
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:01,350
Speaker 0: That is a good one.

846
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,007
Speaker 0: I forgot all about that car is a good one.

847
00:50:03,591 --> 00:50:07,241
Speaker 1: So the birds are sort of like the antagonist like imagine.

848
00:50:07,282 --> 00:50:10,792
Speaker 1: the story is the cats are the Empire and there is Decline.

849
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:13,161
Speaker 0: the birds are like the elf and for the elves.

850
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:15,168
Speaker 1: right there the ancient proud race.

851
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:18,450
Speaker 0: right there They're hidden away, and there's one spot in love laureate.

852
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,803
Speaker 0: And then they got out of the world they got angered and they then they bust out.

853
00:50:22,024 --> 00:50:27,182
Speaker 1: yeah imagine like they're the old Empire That's trying to come back out of the scene now that the cat Romans are in decline.

854
00:50:27,222 --> 00:50:27,463
Speaker 1: right.

855
00:50:27,564 --> 00:50:31,981
Speaker 1: so their deal is they start in One spot and they expand and expand.

856
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:34,150
Speaker 0: they have a shit ton of birds in that one spot.

857
00:50:34,552 --> 00:50:38,050
Speaker 1: So you've got this bird Empire and this cat Empire.

858
00:50:38,191 --> 00:50:39,415
Speaker 1: They're at war and that is the.

859
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:42,166
Speaker 1: the primary crux of the game is the war between these two.

860
00:50:42,186 --> 00:50:42,688
Speaker 0: you don't have to.

861
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:47,880
Speaker 0: you could play Without either of these two things, but in most all the games I've played both of them that you look.

862
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,469
Speaker 1: in the rulebook depending on the number of players There's a list of the options that work.

863
00:50:51,871 --> 00:50:57,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, like mean you could this many players have the birds the cats and any of these other factions.

864
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,164
Speaker 0: It's best if you obey those right.

865
00:50:59,446 --> 00:51:00,030
Speaker 1: it doesn't really.

866
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,301
Speaker 0: Vagabonds is not gonna be too great.

867
00:51:02,482 --> 00:51:08,290
Speaker 1: depend if you have a lot of players You could have two different vagabonds two different raccoons that are independently wandering around stabbing people.

868
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:15,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like if you only have two raccoons and a trading company That's gonna be a weird weird game, so the crux of the game is in the woodland.

869
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:18,858
Speaker 1: in the woods There's this big war going on between the birds and the cats.

870
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:22,370
Speaker 1: the third main faction is the woodland alliance.

871
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:24,358
Speaker 0: These are basically the cute mice.

872
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:26,566
Speaker 1: These are the forest communists right.

873
00:51:26,807 --> 00:51:29,540
Speaker 0: so what they do is They start not on the board at all really.

874
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,430
Speaker 1: They're just the normal woodland citizens.

875
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:31,891
Speaker 1: They're the.

876
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:38,090
Speaker 1: they're the bunnies and the foxes but all the other people living in the woods and they get points by placing.

877
00:51:38,531 --> 00:51:42,342
Speaker 0: Basically when other people do stuff right they get these cards.

878
00:51:42,483 --> 00:51:46,996
Speaker 0: other people's cards end up in the mouse Stack on the mouse card.

879
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:56,050
Speaker 0: the mouse the mouse playing mat right like your other people's cards And they use them will end up over there because they got to pay the mice and then the mice will put.

880
00:51:56,551 --> 00:52:04,775
Speaker 0: Use those cards to perform actions, and they'll put their little fists in different cities on the board like the little little you know in Insurrection fists.

881
00:52:04,815 --> 00:52:06,742
Speaker 0: so the might think of what are they actually called?

882
00:52:06,762 --> 00:52:08,710
Speaker 0: I forget the actual name for the woodland alliance.

883
00:52:08,852 --> 00:52:12,413
Speaker 0: No that name for the fist of the sympathy Wars going.

884
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:14,619
Speaker 0: that city is now sympathetic to the rebellion.

885
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:15,722
Speaker 1: the war is going on.

886
00:52:16,043 --> 00:52:24,466
Speaker 1: the more warring nonsense is happening between the birds And the cats the more sympathy the woodland alliance the rebels who are trying to kick everybody out right.

887
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:26,374
Speaker 0: so the main action That you know.

888
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:32,609
Speaker 0: they put these fist tokens out on the board and they get a lot of points And then they put little like you know a little bases out and they get a lot of points for that too.

889
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:34,918
Speaker 0: And so they can win just like putting these tokens out.

890
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:38,010
Speaker 0: so everyone else has to constantly quell the rebellion.

891
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:39,483
Speaker 0: So and if you don't they will win.

892
00:52:39,684 --> 00:52:42,499
Speaker 1: so though so This is how the game gets political.

893
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:53,214
Speaker 1: the cats and the birds are at war with each other But they will both sort of tacitly agree to maintain martial law in like the non disputed Territories.

894
00:52:53,456 --> 00:52:55,568
Speaker 1: so the woodland alliance can't get a foothold right.

895
00:52:55,729 --> 00:52:57,450
Speaker 1: so I got a war with Scott.

896
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:02,485
Speaker 1: But we both have to while we're warring with each other keep the communists down right.

897
00:53:02,525 --> 00:53:04,290
Speaker 0: and what happens is it's like okay?

898
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,169
Speaker 0: I got a fist here and a little base here.

899
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:10,026
Speaker 0: I'm playing green, but there's a whole bunch of troops here from the birds.

900
00:53:10,347 --> 00:53:11,433
Speaker 0: well, okay I can't.

901
00:53:11,474 --> 00:53:11,796
Speaker 0: they're gonna.

902
00:53:12,038 --> 00:53:16,830
Speaker 0: not only can I not do much about it But they can totally destroy my stuff and get points and jump right.

903
00:53:17,212 --> 00:53:21,982
Speaker 0: But let's say I get my fist up and there's not a lot of guys There is not too strong.

904
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:25,865
Speaker 0: now I can basically rise up in that place and kick ass.

905
00:53:25,946 --> 00:53:29,586
Speaker 0: so suddenly suddenly There's a bunch of mice on the board in that spot because they revolted.

906
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:33,541
Speaker 1: the last game I played I was the birds and Chris was the cats and I was like.

907
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,328
Speaker 1: suddenly the woodland alliance busted out.

908
00:53:35,368 --> 00:53:40,430
Speaker 0: real bad Yeah, so we you cannot let that happen too often otherwise They're just gonna.

909
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:47,359
Speaker 1: So we basically had a truce to go fuck up the wood commune the woodland communists Before they presented a threat to all of us.

910
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,725
Speaker 1: so we had to pause our war.

911
00:53:48,966 --> 00:53:49,970
Speaker 1: yeah for the greater good.

912
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:51,677
Speaker 0: So then you got the vagabond.

913
00:53:51,697 --> 00:53:56,638
Speaker 1: so the vagabond is we've got three big warring factions And the vagabond is just one raccoon.

914
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:59,870
Speaker 0: literally you get one token that you move around the map individually.

915
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,394
Speaker 0: You're just a cute record or you're like an adventurer But actually you're not.

916
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:06,789
Speaker 0: you can choose a sort of a subclass when the game starts.

917
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:08,395
Speaker 0: Tinkerer is op.

918
00:54:08,435 --> 00:54:09,779
Speaker 0: not even gonna lie it just is.

919
00:54:10,181 --> 00:54:11,485
Speaker 0: I didn't even know it was op.

920
00:54:11,846 --> 00:54:14,716
Speaker 0: and then I looked through all that I was The one time I played vagabond.

921
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:21,930
Speaker 0: I was looking through all the different choices, and I was like I Kind of want to be this one for theme, but tinkerer seems strong to me.

922
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,285
Speaker 0: And then I googled it like which one is best.

923
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:27,105
Speaker 0: and it was like tinker Oh my god, and I was like oh, I guess I was right.

924
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:27,730
Speaker 0: Let me be tinker.

925
00:54:28,911 --> 00:54:30,776
Speaker 0: So the tinker is about making stuff right.

926
00:54:31,157 --> 00:54:35,450
Speaker 0: so the way that the vagabond works is you have all these items right now other?

927
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:39,324
Speaker 0: People can craft items in in the game for various purposes.

928
00:54:39,364 --> 00:54:40,950
Speaker 0: they get victory points for crafting items.

929
00:54:41,493 --> 00:54:48,166
Speaker 0: But if you get a vagabond in the game suddenly the items do stuff Every all the items the vagabond has let them perform actions.

930
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:52,630
Speaker 0: the more items They have the more actions they can perform right and do stuff.

931
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:53,414
Speaker 0: They got hammers.

932
00:54:53,656 --> 00:54:55,587
Speaker 0: they can craft things and make their own items.

933
00:54:55,647 --> 00:55:01,930
Speaker 0: if they got Swords they can stab people and do attack actions if they got you know the boot they can move around better, right?

934
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:03,057
Speaker 0: It's all the you know.

935
00:55:03,077 --> 00:55:06,096
Speaker 0: they start with a few items But there's more that they get.

936
00:55:06,176 --> 00:55:10,878
Speaker 0: some of them they get by going around and questing and some of them they get by trading with other players.

937
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:17,070
Speaker 0: also The main way the vagabond gets victory points is not just by building and getting these items.

938
00:55:17,592 --> 00:55:21,750
Speaker 0: It's actually just by helping other people and other people can't refuse your help.

939
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:23,380
Speaker 0: You just help them if you want to.

940
00:55:23,722 --> 00:55:24,346
Speaker 0: right you can.

941
00:55:24,386 --> 00:55:27,228
Speaker 0: you can deal with them I guess, but I just went around helping people.

942
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:29,820
Speaker 0: yep And when you help people you get mad victory points.

943
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,563
Speaker 0: so that you got this.

944
00:55:30,623 --> 00:55:36,843
Speaker 0: you're in it like a sole adventurer Whether you're a tinker or and you know a fighter or whatever you are.

945
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:38,567
Speaker 0: you just one little raccoon token.

946
00:55:38,587 --> 00:55:43,604
Speaker 0: you go around the board And you know you do stuff to help people and you get points for that.

947
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:48,145
Speaker 0: and if you can do more helping Before anyone else can win then you can win.

948
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:48,950
Speaker 1: so think about this.

949
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:53,970
Speaker 1: You're just this one little raccoon wandering around in the midst of this giant cataclysmic war.

950
00:55:54,435 --> 00:56:01,669
Speaker 1: You're just trying to make your way And you're trying to help everybody enough to where no one quite wins the war and then eventually you come out on top yep.

951
00:56:02,553 --> 00:56:06,950
Speaker 0: So then we got this the otters, so I played the otters most recently.

952
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:10,110
Speaker 0: I came super close to winning.

953
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:13,403
Speaker 0: I could have won if I would add just like a couple more victory points here.

954
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,856
Speaker 0: there couldn't quite pull it off if I would Have micromanaged and fought a little harder.

955
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:18,903
Speaker 0: I could have gotten two points somewhere right.

956
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,090
Speaker 0: I could have built a card or something right yeah.

957
00:56:21,231 --> 00:56:24,739
Speaker 1: But at the same time if you'd been doing better I was gonna just pause my war.

958
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:26,910
Speaker 0: you had no idea that I had that many points in the pocket.

959
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:27,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did.

960
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:27,875
Speaker 0: I put out.

961
00:56:27,935 --> 00:56:34,890
Speaker 0: I pulled out like what like eight points in the last turn like BAM Yeah, but I could have destroyed basically all of your things.

962
00:56:35,371 --> 00:56:37,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I was you would you.

963
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,765
Speaker 0: I was ten points away from winning.

964
00:56:38,805 --> 00:56:40,989
Speaker 0: if I was eight away from winning you would have destroyed all my things.

965
00:56:41,892 --> 00:56:43,018
Speaker 0: Come on anyway.

966
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:44,205
Speaker 0: The otters are traders.

967
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,122
Speaker 0: There's a river on the board and you can't really.

968
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:53,884
Speaker 0: the river doesn't really mean anything unless the otter Means a little bit, but if the otters are in the game the river means a lot.

969
00:56:53,945 --> 00:56:55,310
Speaker 0: the otters live along the river.

970
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:57,670
Speaker 0: They can help people travel on the river.

971
00:56:57,811 --> 00:56:59,056
Speaker 0: They can travel on the river.

972
00:56:59,137 --> 00:57:00,021
Speaker 0: kind of right.

973
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:03,755
Speaker 1: basically the otters put up their prices like hey It'll cost you X to use.

974
00:57:03,815 --> 00:57:06,343
Speaker 0: the otters have various services that they sell.

975
00:57:06,403 --> 00:57:08,850
Speaker 0: the services that they sell are like river traveling.

976
00:57:09,472 --> 00:57:15,170
Speaker 0: They sell the cards in their hand face outwards on a little thing and they set those cards are for sale.

977
00:57:15,471 --> 00:57:16,777
Speaker 0: You can't deny some.

978
00:57:16,797 --> 00:57:18,484
Speaker 0: you set a price every turn.

979
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:19,950
Speaker 0: you set your prices for your services.

980
00:57:20,392 --> 00:57:23,990
Speaker 0: But if someone wants to buy one of your cards, you can't say no they buy them, right?

981
00:57:25,212 --> 00:57:27,202
Speaker 0: And what's the other service you have that you sell?

982
00:57:27,222 --> 00:57:29,636
Speaker 0: I think oh, it's fight It's we fight with you.

983
00:57:29,676 --> 00:57:31,890
Speaker 0: You can hire us as mercenaries and we'll fight with you.

984
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:37,677
Speaker 1: So if the otters have some people on the board and I need like say they're on a place and there's some cats there and on The birds I got to deal with the cats.

985
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,109
Speaker 1: I could just pay the otters and now the I'm the otters.

986
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:50,184
Speaker 0: I just leave some otters standing around in a city that I know is gonna have some warring and Someone else comes along and my services cost whatever.

987
00:57:50,224 --> 00:57:51,410
Speaker 0: I set the price at that turn.

988
00:57:51,812 --> 00:57:52,716
Speaker 0: Someone pays the price.

989
00:57:52,897 --> 00:57:55,569
Speaker 0: suddenly the otters get their Spears and join the fight, right?

990
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:59,078
Speaker 0: So the thing is about the otters.

991
00:57:59,098 --> 00:58:02,890
Speaker 0: is that when you pay the otters you pay them with your own dudes.

992
00:58:03,572 --> 00:58:09,135
Speaker 0: You you don't pay them with like money or cards your dudes that are not on the board right now Just like your wooden meeples.

993
00:58:09,536 --> 00:58:11,846
Speaker 0: you give them to the otter player, right?

994
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,296
Speaker 0: So it's like, okay I want to buy a card from you.

995
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:14,778
Speaker 0: Mr.

996
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:15,179
Speaker 0: Otter.

997
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,452
Speaker 0: All right, give me three of your dudes that aren't on the board Okay.

998
00:58:18,593 --> 00:58:20,604
Speaker 0: Well, first of all, your dude supply starts running low.

999
00:58:20,644 --> 00:58:21,730
Speaker 0: if you do this, right?

1000
00:58:22,053 --> 00:58:23,490
Speaker 0: You only have a limited number of dudes.

1001
00:58:23,611 --> 00:58:33,430
Speaker 1: So for example in our last game The cats got kind of desperate and they gave you basically all their dudes to pull off a big play Which means even if they want to put a bunch of dudes on the board?

1002
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,369
Speaker 0: Well, I'm holding on to those dudes too bad.

1003
00:58:35,952 --> 00:58:44,301
Speaker 0: And then when you're the otters and you want to perform actions you spend the dudes that you've got Not only the dudes other people gave you but also your own dudes.

1004
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:55,650
Speaker 0: if no one gave you any dudes you basically get two of Your own dudes into your into your purse for spending Right, and then it's sort of like buying nothing from yourself for two dudes automatically, right?

1005
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,484
Speaker 0: So you're gonna be able to do stuff and you spend these dudes in various actions.

1006
00:58:59,725 --> 00:59:11,790
Speaker 0: some actions that you might perform just sort of put the dudes into a holding pen and then they go back to the purse next turn and Sometimes when for certain actions you actually have to give the dudes back to the player they came from in order to spend the dudes.

1007
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:20,110
Speaker 1: so basically imagine like I don't know Corsica or Venice you know, there's a big war going on and you're outside like not in the forest.

1008
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:34,090
Speaker 1: You're like, hey There's a war going on and you slide in along the river and start selling weapons to everybody and then eventually Everybody fighting the war owes you so much money that you are in fact control of the content in control of the country.

1009
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:39,230
Speaker 0: The primary way you score victory points when you're the otters is you know the same way everyone else's scores victory points.

1010
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:45,190
Speaker 0: but the number one way is Building trading posts which give you mad points when you put them out on the board.

1011
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:50,630
Speaker 0: So I basically and building a trading post cost you other people's dudes, right?

1012
00:59:51,191 --> 00:59:54,050
Speaker 0: You just like every all your other actions building a trading post cause dudes.

1013
00:59:54,572 --> 01:00:01,330
Speaker 0: So I basically had a bunch of dudes and it was getting close to the end of the game And I put out like three or four trading posts all at once.

1014
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,780
Speaker 0: I got a pile of points and was too short of winning.

1015
01:00:04,182 --> 01:00:07,515
Speaker 0: if I just gotten two points earlier in the game Boom, I would have had it.

1016
01:00:07,555 --> 01:00:13,419
Speaker 1: but you only had that capability because the cats who were desperate Spent a ton of money with you.

1017
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:19,125
Speaker 0: Well, they right they would have had to either right it They would have still done that if I had two more victory points, right?

1018
01:00:19,145 --> 01:00:20,491
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

1019
01:00:20,772 --> 01:00:21,355
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe they.

1020
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:24,290
Speaker 0: maybe you would have looked carefully, but that's the thing the game.

1021
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:26,850
Speaker 0: But also if I looked carefully I would have had two more points by then.

1022
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:42,387
Speaker 1: So basically what this comes down to is it's a pretty abs like well abstracted asymmetric kind of realistic war gamey game With cute animals and the theme works really well and the game is just really fun to play.

1023
01:00:42,407 --> 01:00:43,751
Speaker 1: It doesn't even take that long Mm-hmm.

1024
01:00:44,152 --> 01:00:49,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like people were so hype about root when it first came out and I was like my mood on.

1025
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:52,976
Speaker 0: It was like I like the cute animals You know, but I'm not unlike.

1026
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:54,283
Speaker 0: why is everyone so excited?

1027
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:55,388
Speaker 0: How great can it be?

1028
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:00,610
Speaker 1: And I saw other people who weren't our friends playing it and their games were taking like four hours, right?

1029
01:01:00,852 --> 01:01:01,400
Speaker 0: You know, I was like.

1030
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,070
Speaker 0: I was like, all right.

1031
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:05,869
Speaker 0: I got to see what the deal is obviously right and then I played it once and I was like, all right.

1032
01:01:07,255 --> 01:01:09,190
Speaker 0: And then I played it again and I was like, all right.

1033
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:15,315
Speaker 0: The second playthrough is when you see the fun of this game and then the third time I'm like, you know I think you know you.

1034
01:01:15,536 --> 01:01:23,450
Speaker 0: the first few games of it that I played it was sort of like, all right I'll play root the the time I played most recently with the otters.

1035
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:27,065
Speaker 0: Yeah That was the first time where I was like bust out the root Scott.

1036
01:01:27,106 --> 01:01:29,155
Speaker 1: wait till you try the birds Next time we play.

1037
01:01:29,195 --> 01:01:30,380
Speaker 0: I don't really want to be the birds.

1038
01:01:30,762 --> 01:01:32,470
Speaker 0: They have that whole failing thing.

1039
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:37,270
Speaker 1: So here's an example of like a detail because I played the birds twice and I really like the birds.

1040
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:37,814
Speaker 1: They're fun.

1041
01:01:38,197 --> 01:01:43,304
Speaker 1: Their deal is that they're a Free so you choose a leader depending and there's two.

1042
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,850
Speaker 1: there's four things you can do on your turn.

1043
01:01:45,253 --> 01:01:46,929
Speaker 1: You can recruit like make more birdies.

1044
01:01:47,472 --> 01:01:57,130
Speaker 1: you can move your birdies around you can fight people with the birdies and you can build stuff and Depending on the leader you pick you have a wild card in two of those spots.

1045
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:00,570
Speaker 1: So say I have I start with a wild card and recruit in battle.

1046
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:02,259
Speaker 1: Every turn.

1047
01:02:02,279 --> 01:02:07,450
Speaker 1: you must do Everything in the decree or your government collapses, right?

1048
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:09,277
Speaker 0: So in the first turn I recruit and I battle.

1049
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:12,170
Speaker 1: the next turn I have to add another card to the decree.

1050
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:15,310
Speaker 0: So now every single turn your decree keeps getting bigger.

1051
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:19,350
Speaker 0: So you have to do everything you did last turn and more every turn.

1052
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:21,150
Speaker 0: So now I have to recruit move in battle.

1053
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:28,818
Speaker 0: No next turn after recruit move battle battle and I have to recruit recruit move battle battle and even better a decision You can make at the start of your turn.

1054
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:30,789
Speaker 1: you must add one card to the decree.

1055
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:34,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, you may add two right now.

1056
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,964
Speaker 0: This is basically each turn.

1057
01:02:36,004 --> 01:02:38,210
Speaker 0: It's like wow, I get more actions every single turn.

1058
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:42,184
Speaker 0: It's like you just keep getting stronger and stronger and stronger, but then that's true.

1059
01:02:42,244 --> 01:02:43,950
Speaker 1: Oh, no, there's no one to fight.

1060
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,435
Speaker 0: It's like I have to do.

1061
01:02:46,836 --> 01:02:47,839
Speaker 0: I recruit recruit.

1062
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,410
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't have enough guys to recruit recruit recruit recruit move.

1063
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,018
Speaker 0: I don't have any legal moves.

1064
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:55,690
Speaker 0: recruit recruit move battle battle.

1065
01:02:56,212 --> 01:03:00,210
Speaker 0: There's no dudes in a spot that can battle because I didn't have enough move.

1066
01:03:00,356 --> 01:03:04,574
Speaker 0: Yeah And as soon as you can't do all of the actions You fail.

1067
01:03:04,594 --> 01:03:05,799
Speaker 0: your government just collapses.

1068
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:06,682
Speaker 1: you lose a bunch of points.

1069
01:03:06,722 --> 01:03:08,730
Speaker 1: You got to pick a new leader and fun stuff happens.

1070
01:03:08,854 --> 01:03:14,470
Speaker 0: Yeah So usually people fail a couple of times every game except for the game.

1071
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:16,418
Speaker 1: I just talked about where I never failed.

1072
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:23,520
Speaker 0: my family somehow managed to play the whole game and Never failed at the decree and therefore won.

1073
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,032
Speaker 0: I think I think if you're the birds and you never fail the decree You're gonna win.

1074
01:03:27,233 --> 01:03:29,042
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is real hard to pull off.

1075
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:30,550
Speaker 0: It's sort of like a foregone thing.

1076
01:03:30,751 --> 01:03:37,576
Speaker 1: I got to a point to where I literally needed someone to attack me to give me an opportunity to attack them back Or I was gonna fail in the.

1077
01:03:37,616 --> 01:03:38,662
Speaker 0: you would have failed the next turn.

1078
01:03:38,823 --> 01:03:40,190
Speaker 1: I would have definitely failed the next turn.

1079
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:43,423
Speaker 0: There's no way you could have because I had built everything I could possibly build.

1080
01:03:43,805 --> 01:03:45,130
Speaker 1: all my roosts were on the board.

1081
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:47,624
Speaker 1: Oh, I literally could not have built another roost.

1082
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:48,067
Speaker 0: Yep.

1083
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:50,079
Speaker 1: Yeah So my government would have collapsed.

1084
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,934
Speaker 0: even if you fail just once with the birds You're still likely.

1085
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,442
Speaker 0: you're still close to winning.

1086
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:56,130
Speaker 0: you need to so you need to fail twice.

1087
01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:07,690
Speaker 1: I feel like a normal strategy for the birds is to pick a leader have a strategy push it hard fail Strategically at the right moment start your decree over and then use that to win the game.

1088
01:04:08,092 --> 01:04:11,874
Speaker 0: The thing is when you start the decree over too late It will.

1089
01:04:12,055 --> 01:04:14,210
Speaker 0: it won't become big and strong enough that right?

1090
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:20,423
Speaker 0: You're taking too few Points, you're trying to put yourself when you when you fail, right?

1091
01:04:20,563 --> 01:04:21,647
Speaker 0: It's like oh shit.

1092
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:22,830
Speaker 0: I don't have enough actions.

1093
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:25,226
Speaker 0: It's late game and I'm taking like piddly actions.

1094
01:04:25,247 --> 01:04:25,750
Speaker 0: There's no good.

1095
01:04:25,831 --> 01:04:33,163
Speaker 0: I think you need to get big and fail fast So that way you could those the the second decree that I got reset.

1096
01:04:33,444 --> 01:04:39,509
Speaker 0: the weak actions are still early enough in the game And you'll have strong but barely doable actions towards the end.

1097
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:42,510
Speaker 0: But assuming you can't pull off a miracle like never fail.

1098
01:04:42,831 --> 01:04:56,150
Speaker 1: But then when stuff gets interesting is like other players like maybe the cats will work hard by buying the otters support to Make it impossible for the decree to work at a point when the birds did not prepare for that.

1099
01:04:56,452 --> 01:04:58,250
Speaker 1: I think that can be fun and weird.

1100
01:04:58,451 --> 01:05:10,510
Speaker 0: So I think that the thing with this game is right is like even though I've played it three four times It's still like a low-level like understanding even though I understand everyone's but the lizard folk and the cats kind of how they work.

1101
01:05:11,152 --> 01:05:12,355
Speaker 0: Is that you're?

1102
01:05:12,515 --> 01:05:14,501
Speaker 0: you have this so such an asymmetric?

1103
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:16,186
Speaker 0: you're playing your own game thing.

1104
01:05:16,226 --> 01:05:27,126
Speaker 0: going on that until you completely understand everyone else's thing and Everyone else understands everyone else's thing then you can get into the play of like aha.

1105
01:05:27,146 --> 01:05:31,118
Speaker 0: I Know how decrees work as I've played birds like three times.

1106
01:05:31,138 --> 01:05:35,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not the birds now, but I know how to fuck those birds up.

1107
01:05:35,491 --> 01:05:37,690
Speaker 0: Let's make sure rims decree fails next turn.

1108
01:05:38,071 --> 01:05:40,720
Speaker 0: I don't think he can make three moves if we do this.

1109
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:41,823
Speaker 1: cuz like I wasn't.

1110
01:05:41,863 --> 01:05:42,666
Speaker 0: rims like shit.

1111
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:48,627
Speaker 1: watch a first playthrough with naive players and three or four players like the wooden alliance just always wins because it wasn't.

1112
01:05:48,648 --> 01:05:52,567
Speaker 0: Alliance is very Straightforward gets a lot of points and automatically wins if it's not quelled.

1113
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:53,070
Speaker 1: if yeah.

1114
01:05:53,291 --> 01:06:01,555
Speaker 1: So you watch advanced players play this game and like the cats and the birds will both be like, all right Let's pause hostilities first.

1115
01:06:01,595 --> 01:06:02,458
Speaker 0: take out the communist.

1116
01:06:02,478 --> 01:06:04,624
Speaker 0: the first order of business is like always.

1117
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:06,089
Speaker 0: don't let green win now.

1118
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:07,587
Speaker 0: Let's see who else will win.

1119
01:06:08,692 --> 01:06:10,605
Speaker 0: But then say some ingredients in the game.

1120
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:11,230
Speaker 0: You might have a green.

1121
01:06:11,552 --> 01:06:14,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could play red, you know, you could play otters and red and blue.

1122
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:15,737
Speaker 1: I forget the list of like.

1123
01:06:15,858 --> 01:06:17,469
Speaker 1: what are all the combinations that work?

1124
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,814
Speaker 1: Yeah But don't let any.

1125
01:06:19,914 --> 01:06:26,090
Speaker 1: this game only takes a super long time to play if the people at your table just suck at playing game.

1126
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:29,830
Speaker 0: I'm sure there must also be teaching videos on YouTube to help you learn.

1127
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:38,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know cuz it is, you know Like I said if you're a gamer if you're listening to a podcast if you're going to a gaming con if you play other Board games you can play this game.

1128
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:39,829
Speaker 0: Don't be scared away by it.

1129
01:06:40,472 --> 01:06:44,668
Speaker 0: The cute animal creatures should help you but it's not the simplest.

1130
01:06:44,728 --> 01:06:51,225
Speaker 0: you do need You know some help learning it, but someone to teach you read the rules read them again Watch a video.

1131
01:06:51,751 --> 01:06:58,841
Speaker 1: Do one thing I noticed that works that I like about this game like a big part of why I think it was fun even Though those learning games and I've never seen a game do that.

1132
01:06:58,881 --> 01:06:59,605
Speaker 1: I've seen a few games.

1133
01:06:59,645 --> 01:06:59,926
Speaker 1: do this.

1134
01:06:59,946 --> 01:07:00,750
Speaker 1: Well, but it's rare.

1135
01:07:01,572 --> 01:07:04,310
Speaker 1: You only need to to like to have fun with the game.

1136
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:15,590
Speaker 1: you only need to fully understand how to play your character and You only really need the flavor text of the rest of the characters to have a vague idea of how to handle them.

1137
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:22,170
Speaker 1: Yep Like just knowing that you can trade with the otters and the otter player will explain how to trade with them.

1138
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:23,015
Speaker 1: It's really straightforward.

1139
01:07:23,055 --> 01:07:25,550
Speaker 0: knowing that if you do this that will help that play.

1140
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:31,766
Speaker 1: Yeah If I play with if I trade with the otters too much It'll make them strong is enough for me to play in a game where there are otters.

1141
01:07:31,846 --> 01:07:34,460
Speaker 0: if I do this stuff I'll be giving too many cards to green.

1142
01:07:34,501 --> 01:07:36,010
Speaker 0: Stop giving so many cards to green.

1143
01:07:36,211 --> 01:07:40,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I do this then you know, the birds decree will be too easy.

1144
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:40,973
Speaker 0: Don't do that.

1145
01:07:41,254 --> 01:07:44,649
Speaker 1: And that's the thing the game the fiction of the game.

1146
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:45,693
Speaker 0: Don't give.

1147
01:07:45,733 --> 01:07:49,186
Speaker 0: don't give the vagabond all the good items that they want and this only give them some.

1148
01:07:49,247 --> 01:07:50,130
Speaker 1: this what I think coal.

1149
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:59,398
Speaker 1: We're brought to that world brought to the table that the fiction of the game itself and the flavor text gives you Reasonably effective heuristics to play the game.

1150
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:00,021
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

1151
01:08:00,121 --> 01:08:02,330
Speaker 1: Like that is a rare thing in games.

1152
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:04,495
Speaker 1: Treasure that when you find it.

1153
01:08:04,696 --> 01:08:04,896
Speaker 1: Yep.

1154
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:09,189
Speaker 0: So yeah, there's expansion which adds the otters and lizards, right?

1155
01:08:09,229 --> 01:08:11,183
Speaker 0: Yep The game's super hot.

1156
01:08:11,324 --> 01:08:16,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, the lizard There's keep printing these things as long as people keep buying them.

1157
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:21,358
