1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,804
Speaker 1: It's Pi Day!

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:11,746
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:14,072
Speaker 1: I'm Rim, and this is Geek Nights.

4
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:19,335
Speaker 1: Tonight, we discuss the not-so-new anime Juu-O-Sei.

5
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:21,896
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:24,812
Speaker 0: Behold internet.

7
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:25,439
Speaker 0: we are back.

8
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:33,205
Speaker 1: Aha our link to the outside world and the source of infinite information has been Re-formed.

9
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:37,176
Speaker 0: I guess it is a sign that we're becoming moderately popular.

10
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:43,500
Speaker 0: the shared number of complaints Compared to how many complaints I would have expected to the fact that we uploaded one episode late.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh people you know they can't have anything Change even slightly in their daily routine.

12
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:53,760
Speaker 0: What are they gonna do if we change the music or something?

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,705
Speaker 1: They'll just like kill themselves.

14
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:56,187
Speaker 1: I don't know.

15
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:59,739
Speaker 0: or what if you get throat surgery, then I die and get replaced with Emily?

16
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,408
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

17
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:04,950
Speaker 1: Will the show even continue at that point?

18
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:06,780
Speaker 0: I see the show continuing well.

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,507
Speaker 0: It'll be kind of like the Tonight Show.

20
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:09,773
Speaker 0: it'll just have a different host.

21
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:13,709
Speaker 0: when we get old and die We'll appoint someone else to take over.

22
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:19,592
Speaker 1: someone will eventually be the Johnny Carson of Geek Nights And hopefully they won't be the Jon Stewart and people will think back.

23
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:20,415
Speaker 1: Oh rim and Scott.

24
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:20,997
Speaker 1: They suck this.

25
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:21,780
Speaker 1: yeah, it's way better.

26
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:28,233
Speaker 0: I almost feel bad for Craig Kilborn, but then I don't because I liked him But he wasn't even half as funny as Jon Stewart.

27
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:29,319
Speaker 1: No not really.

28
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:33,090
Speaker 1: Oh, well yeah apparently this whole time.

29
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,560
Speaker 1: It was the cable modem that was broken.

30
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:37,231
Speaker 0: Yeah, now now think about that for a minute.

31
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:42,180
Speaker 0: We had a tech come and He looked at our cable modem and said wow your internet's not working.

32
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:52,060
Speaker 0: And I assumed I assumed that he considered the possibility that the most obvious direct Common point of failure might be the problem.

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,040
Speaker 0: But no he climbed up the utility pole and looked at the wires up there and even replaced some of them.

34
00:01:57,362 --> 00:01:58,954
Speaker 0: He looked at the wires to the house.

35
00:01:58,994 --> 00:01:59,639
Speaker 0: He fixed them.

36
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:05,560
Speaker 1: He replaced all the connectors outside the house called some guys to come the next day and replace some of the wires outside.

37
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:12,346
Speaker 0: He tested all the cables in the whole house, but he didn't actually check the cable modem and sure enough That was what was broken.

38
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:14,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was kind of weird too.

39
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:15,380
Speaker 1: I mean cuz the cable modem.

40
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,550
Speaker 1: It's a as far as we're concerned.

41
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,375
Speaker 1: It's a black box.

42
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:19,420
Speaker 1: We know nothing about it.

43
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,525
Speaker 1: It's just a cable modem.

44
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:26,048
Speaker 1: a cable goes in one end and internet comes out the other end And we have no control over it or anything.

45
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:35,273
Speaker 1: and looking at the lights on the cable modem is about all the information We've got and those lights Indicated that the cable modem was working as well as it ever had.

46
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,919
Speaker 1: so how did we know it was I?

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,075
Speaker 1: Didn't even consider that it'd be broken because it looked like it was working well.

48
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,868
Speaker 0: apparently the new one Emily was is she had to deal with this.

49
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:59,559
Speaker 0: the story is second hand but he comes and he sets it up And then he asks for Internet Explorer because he has to connect to the thing and configure it to which she says Internet Explorer, that's that's not the kind of thing that this household would have Which is pretty much true.

50
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:12,612
Speaker 1: that's that the only place that it's in this has to household right now is if you reboot my desktop or This laptop that I'm going to install Ubuntu on probably tonight Because now I have internet so I can do this.

51
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:19,220
Speaker 0: if you reboot my computer And that's currently in Linux into Windows safe mode you can get to Internet Explorer.

52
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:22,213
Speaker 1: It's not easy to use Internet Explorer in our house unless you bring your own.

53
00:03:22,474 --> 00:03:23,799
Speaker 1: so the guy you why oh, I?

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,939
Speaker 0: Apparently this guy couldn't fathom the possibility of their existing another web browser let alone that someone would have a reason not to use Internet Explorer.

55
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:41,180
Speaker 0: and Somehow he is a the senior most senior Tech for cable vision or at least the last one they sent.

56
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:47,360
Speaker 1: Maybe they said that they were sending like the most senior guy possible and that they wouldn't leave until they fixed it.

57
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:56,795
Speaker 0: Well it got even further because he's asking like what kind of people don't have Internet Explorer, and she's explaining well It's two computer guys, and I do computer animation and to it.

58
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,200
Speaker 0: Here's the interesting thing He didn't understand what computer animation was at all.

59
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:05,199
Speaker 0: She had to explain it to him in simplified dummy terms.

60
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:08,188
Speaker 0: Like you know Pixar isn't.

61
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,073
Speaker 1: this is a town full of art.

62
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:10,715
Speaker 1: people don't?

63
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:11,658
Speaker 1: they all have Macs.

64
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:12,279
Speaker 1: what the hell?

65
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:19,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, so he he looks at the Mac And he says I don't see Internet Explorer, and she says just click on the other on Firefox.

66
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:20,440
Speaker 0: to what she says what?

67
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:30,760
Speaker 0: So she shows him and he tries to use Firefox And it totally doesn't work with whatever garbage is on this cable modem, so eventually he uses Safari, and it works.

68
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:31,921
Speaker 1: What?

69
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:33,145
Speaker 1: shouldn't the cable modem?

70
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:34,248
Speaker 1: just be plug-and-play?

71
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:36,174
Speaker 1: Why does it need any sort of configuring?

72
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:38,019
Speaker 0: actually it needs quite a bit of configuring?

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,108
Speaker 0: Usually that's not ahead of time, but a lot of times There's a ID in there so they can identify it.

74
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,839
Speaker 0: sometimes some of them have routers or DHCP stuff built in.

75
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:53,620
Speaker 1: yeah But I mean if you get a cable box for cable television even a digital one they configure it from the cable headquarters.

76
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,568
Speaker 1: They don't need to come there to configure it.

77
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:58,200
Speaker 1: They plug it in with the coax and they configure it from that end.

78
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, why should there be any configuration?

79
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:05,240
Speaker 0: because there's no difference and usually remember It's not like he had the pre-configured one ready.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,380
Speaker 0: He came decided to replace it and pulled a virgin one out of his truck.

81
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:11,980
Speaker 0: It's true it had to be configured for our house.

82
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:19,033
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe you had to tell it not to show us actual TV or Maybe you had to disable the telephony because it's got two telephone lines in the back.

83
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:25,045
Speaker 0: for if you want to use that special voice Over IP business that they offer yeah yeah, oh well is.

84
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:32,070
Speaker 1: the other modem that we got rid of was like the same brand, but smaller and older and It was always very hot.

85
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,238
Speaker 0: so all cable modems are always very hot I know.

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,388
Speaker 1: But I'm wondering like what did it in?

87
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:41,425
Speaker 1: because the way it broke was very strange where the internet was slow Working not working working not working.

88
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:44,995
Speaker 1: I'm willing to bet that the heat over time damaged the goods.

89
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:46,680
Speaker 0: Well, that's a very common thing.

90
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,706
Speaker 0: That's what destroyed my geforce 2 GTS.

91
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:49,228
Speaker 0: Eventually.

92
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:51,977
Speaker 0: The heat was just too much and the GPU.

93
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:52,920
Speaker 0: I don't know what happened.

94
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:03,780
Speaker 0: I think the RAM actually on the mother on the video card went bad because that was when it started Showing the wrong colors of things and the display was all weird, but the video card otherwise worked just fine.

95
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:07,995
Speaker 1: Well now that this new cable modem is plugged in I'm gonna go see if it's hot.

96
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:15,620
Speaker 1: because if it's not hot Then I will assume because that's all I really can't assume that it is very likely that the old modem was always broken.

97
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:17,272
Speaker 1: It was just only.

98
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:18,300
Speaker 0: I would doubt that cuz art.

99
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:29,362
Speaker 0: I think part of the problem is that our cable modem was actually pretty old Compared to the one that they gave us now And I've never in my life had a cable modem or seen a cable modem that wasn't extremely warm And it was on.

100
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:37,476
Speaker 1: I've seen them that they're they the ones when they used to be the size of cable boxes Oh, those were even hotter or when they used to also be your cable box those weren't?

101
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:38,380
Speaker 1: some of those weren't really hot.

102
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were at least the ones I had.

103
00:06:40,188 --> 00:06:42,578
Speaker 1: Oh different cable boxes different places.

104
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,989
Speaker 0: yeah remember I had a cable modem in like 1995.

105
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,280
Speaker 1: you really need is people keep in gadget.

106
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,672
Speaker 1: especially they keep complaining about this cable card support that is supposedly in Vista.

107
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:57,673
Speaker 1: and if anyone doesn't know if you have cable television in Your cable box you might notice like a credit card sticking out the front of it.

108
00:06:58,155 --> 00:06:59,059
Speaker 1: That's a cable card.

109
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:15,000
Speaker 1: supposedly this is technology that no one is implemented for consumer use where you can take that card and put it in another Cable-card device such as a TiVo or a computer running Windows Media Center or anything like that.

110
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:16,959
Speaker 1: And now you don't need a cable box.

111
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:30,112
Speaker 1: You just need any device that has a coax input that can also house this card that so that way they know you're not stealing cable because you have the card and You don't have to rent a cable box from the cable company or anything.

112
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:31,900
Speaker 1: you can use whatever device you've got.

113
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:33,807
Speaker 1: This technology exists.

114
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,252
Speaker 1: It's all.

115
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:37,239
Speaker 1: the cable boxes come with cable cards in them.

116
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:38,705
Speaker 1: You know it's there.

117
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:42,400
Speaker 1: It's ready, but the devices that can hold these cable cards?

118
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:45,120
Speaker 1: No one's making them even though Vista technically has support.

119
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:57,243
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering maybe once we get over the hurdle of having cable card support for television Transmission we could just get routers with cable cards, so I go to the store by any router I want.

120
00:07:57,504 --> 00:08:00,800
Speaker 1: I don't need their crazy cable modem from the cable company.

121
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,467
Speaker 1: I just put a cable card in my own router.

122
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,623
Speaker 0: um you would still need a cable modem because what that does is It's a modem.

123
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:11,678
Speaker 1: it translates yes analog signal, but I would get my own like I might have do that.

124
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:16,822
Speaker 0: now even with our current cable you can just buy a cable modem and Configure it.

125
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:18,187
Speaker 0: however they say and it'll just work.

126
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:19,974
Speaker 0: huh in fact.

127
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:21,400
Speaker 0: We'd save money if we did that.

128
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:23,988
Speaker 1: No, cuz we pay a flat rate.

129
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:26,116
Speaker 1: There's no it doesn't break down.

130
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:26,879
Speaker 1: I looked at the bill.

131
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:33,860
Speaker 0: well Every other cable I've ever had in my life broke down And you were renting the cable modem And it cost like five bucks a month within your normal bill.

132
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:39,398
Speaker 0: And if you called them specially and said I already have a cable modem They wouldn't give you one and they charge you five bucks less.

133
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,432
Speaker 1: Well, maybe we'll look into that because it's not worth.

134
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:44,179
Speaker 0: the cable does break all the time.

135
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:53,757
Speaker 1: Well, I'm thinking if you had a computer that you would say also using as a firewall and a DHCP server and all that other Besides it would also if you had a router like that you'd get really hot.

136
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:58,119
Speaker 1: well You'd have like a PCI card that was a cable a PCI card that would get really hot.

137
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,629
Speaker 1: yeah But you could have a fan Which the cable modem does not have a fan.

138
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:04,159
Speaker 0: so you want a fan on a little PCI card in the back of your PC.

139
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:08,020
Speaker 1: No, I'd have one of those fans that takes up a PCI slot next to it.

140
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:16,720
Speaker 0: You know you'd be better off having What some sort of box outside of your computer separate from the computer that could cool itself and you didn't have to worry about it.

141
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,000
Speaker 1: maybe maybe maybe a Cable modem, but this one doesn't have a fan either.

142
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:23,244
Speaker 0: It doesn't need a fan.

143
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,420
Speaker 0: it only needs a fan if it's in your computer generating heats and eating your dudes.

144
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,673
Speaker 0: Anyway anime day so Probably my favorite manga creator ever going a guy.

145
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:41,323
Speaker 0: It's not your favorite manga creator ever He's my favorite in terms of name recognition and name Recall.

146
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:42,911
Speaker 0: I like saying going a guy.

147
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:47,920
Speaker 1: okay going a guy is fun to say But I think you might recall Osamu Tezuka more.

148
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:51,053
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't don't recall isn't recalling the name in order to say it.

149
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:57,816
Speaker 0: I don't say haha Osamu Tezuka all the time, but I say haha going a guy going a guy.

150
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:10,420
Speaker 0: well and also The guy who made gogo 13 and a whole bunch of other mangaka in Japan are Suing the everliving shit out of some kids who were running a website that was hosting scans of their manga.

151
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:20,832
Speaker 0: Really, they're suing for 22 million yen in damages and apparently these guys already lost another lawsuit Not too long ago over the same website.

152
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,119
Speaker 0: the website is currently down.

153
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:23,783
Speaker 1: Wait wait.

154
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,148
Speaker 1: so who lost the guy?

155
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:26,313
Speaker 1: the kids or kids?

156
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:27,599
Speaker 0: I'm obviously all right.

157
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,528
Speaker 0: You read the same article.

158
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:30,975
Speaker 0: This was your news before I took it.

159
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:32,060
Speaker 1: Why didn't I actually read it?

160
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,785
Speaker 1: I was going to.

161
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:33,997
Speaker 1: so what were you gonna say?

162
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:34,098
Speaker 1: well?

163
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,585
Speaker 1: I just looked up the two million.

164
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:48,534
Speaker 0: twenty two million yen is well the article is kind of almost $200,000 because the article says and I quote blah blah blah are seeking 22 million yen Approximately 20 million u.s.. Dollars in damages.

165
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:49,539
Speaker 0: nothing about that for a minute.

166
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:54,520
Speaker 0: That's saying that a yen is worth about a dollar, which I don't think our currencies fallen that far yet.

167
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,973
Speaker 1: No, it says right here according to Google.

168
00:10:57,174 --> 00:11:00,746
Speaker 1: I typed into Google 22 million yen in dollars.

169
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:01,629
Speaker 0: so good job.

170
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:06,384
Speaker 0: anime news that it says you were once again the source of Perfectly factual news.

171
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:09,332
Speaker 1: well anime news network is attempting to hire a new editor.

172
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:12,200
Speaker 1: Maybe that will help them with their false information.

173
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,203
Speaker 0: I'm not too worried.

174
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:18,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is this article is kind of useless - they don't actually say like was this cancellations?

175
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,484
Speaker 0: Was it just scans?

176
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:22,012
Speaker 0: was the website primarily for Americans?

177
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:23,156
Speaker 0: was for Japanese people?

178
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:24,320
Speaker 0: was it just a straight-up bootleg?

179
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:30,678
Speaker 1: There's none of that doesn't really say who was running the website or like what the website had on it exactly.

180
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,009
Speaker 0: even better They said a source right source my Nietzsche.

181
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,766
Speaker 0: They link to my Nietzsche the front page So I couldn't even follow this.

182
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:42,396
Speaker 0: see a lot of people on dig and all over the internet.

183
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,280
Speaker 0: We're talking about this.

184
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:47,480
Speaker 0: Oh, they're gonna go after the scans laters, but we don't know if this had anything to do with that.

185
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:50,129
Speaker 0: This might have been just straight-up piracy in Japan.

186
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,959
Speaker 1: I have a feeling it was just piracy in Japan.

187
00:11:52,979 --> 00:12:06,517
Speaker 0: and yeah, if that's the case I have to give the Balls award to these two guys for just openly running a non obfuscated straight-up piracy server on their own.

188
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:10,550
Speaker 1: and If you do that, this is what's gonna happen.

189
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:12,879
Speaker 0: I mean they were running it in Japan, too.

190
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,188
Speaker 0: It's not like they were running it in Russia or Belarus.

191
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:18,100
Speaker 1: dudes at least use a bit torrent or something.

192
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,647
Speaker 1: So you don't get caught like this.

193
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:25,479
Speaker 0: I mean where sites like that existed in 1995.

194
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,068
Speaker 1: oh Wow, you're right where sites don't really exist anymore.

195
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:29,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, remember cracks.

196
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:30,977
Speaker 0: Are you is that still there?

197
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:31,599
Speaker 0: I don't know.

198
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:36,717
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure like I'm gonna type it in hasta la vista might still exist cracks.

199
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,720
Speaker 0: Are you is not loading?

200
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,058
Speaker 0: I think it's gone.

201
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,000
Speaker 0: So I'd like to talk about the ramifications of this.

202
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,612
Speaker 0: But I have no information other than the anime news network.

203
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:46,119
Speaker 0: for all I know they just made this story up.

204
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:52,256
Speaker 1: So the news that was originally Manga pirates pond is actually anime news network.

205
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,360
Speaker 1: Not so good at reporting.

206
00:12:53,743 --> 00:13:00,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, a little from column a little from column B I mean the fact that it involved going a guy is the primary reason I brought it up.

207
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,829
Speaker 0: Also the fact that nothing else happened.

208
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,954
Speaker 0: There were some release dates.

209
00:13:03,994 --> 00:13:05,339
Speaker 0: I don't care about that's about it.

210
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:09,073
Speaker 1: Not much going down in the anime world is mostly game news lately.

211
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:10,780
Speaker 1: and well we didn't do news yesterday.

212
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:12,959
Speaker 1: So there's gonna be a flood next week in the week after.

213
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:16,536
Speaker 1: Alright, so last week cats in America died.

214
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:17,059
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

215
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,120
Speaker 1: Oh, no, if you don't know by now Wow, are you living under a rock?

216
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,299
Speaker 1: And if you don't know by now, you're probably someone who doesn't care.

217
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:28,259
Speaker 0: I probably wouldn't have known if I weren't doing a podcast and reading the news.

218
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:29,891
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

219
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:31,461
Speaker 1: I mean I wouldn't have known either I didn't.

220
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:36,100
Speaker 1: I don't read those comics unless I wasn't hanging around a comic forum and listen to the podcast.

221
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:36,724
Speaker 0: I'll let money.

222
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:37,872
Speaker 0: he's back within two years.

223
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:39,160
Speaker 1: almost definitely.

224
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:49,864
Speaker 1: I saw actually pictures today of like some covers that may or may not be fake of like the punisher is gonna be Captain America For a while, which is typical Superhero fan crap.

225
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:53,535
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know who should be if anyone's gonna take over Captain America's job.

226
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:55,040
Speaker 0: It's gotta be the comedian.

227
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:04,700
Speaker 1: Anyway, so there's a hubbub about this actually and of course You know you make a comic where someone dies and it gets all over the news.

228
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:06,249
Speaker 1: So there's gonna be a run.

229
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,040
Speaker 1: the demand is high for this comic.

230
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,299
Speaker 1: They're actually gonna make in a second printing which is not as common as it used to be.

231
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:13,960
Speaker 1: So, of course the price is high.

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,080
Speaker 1: You're not gonna pay the usual cover price for this thing.

233
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:25,878
Speaker 1: If you want this you're gonna have to pay like five bucks Maybe unless you go to a good comic book store where they just charge cover price in which case They're probably sold out until they get another batch in.

234
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:41,700
Speaker 1: however No, nobody knew that Captain America when it's gonna die in this comic before it showed up at the store I mean the comic guys ordered Captain America number 25 Just like they ordered number 24 and they get it and they read it and then they put it on the shelf.

235
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:46,474
Speaker 1: And it wasn't until that day that it hit shelves that people knew it was going on in it.

236
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:50,418
Speaker 1: now people at Marvel knew because Well, they made it but nobody else knew.

237
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:57,523
Speaker 0: Well, obviously the people at Marvel and all their friends and family and then all the friends and family of all them I don't know.

238
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,469
Speaker 1: There were actually people at Marvel who didn't know.

239
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:02,699
Speaker 1: it seemed that only kept it close to the chest on this one.

240
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:10,604
Speaker 1: However people at Wizard magazine perhaps one of the worst magazines in existence at least, you know It's not what it.

241
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:18,400
Speaker 1: I guess it's not the worst magazine in existence because there are far worse magazines Like I don't know the Enquirer and such weekly world news.

242
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:22,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, weekly world news is at least funny though, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.

243
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:29,640
Speaker 1: But the wizard magazine it's supposed to be like it has the potential to be an awesome magazine because it's about awesome stuff.

244
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,127
Speaker 1: It's like nerd magazine.

245
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,760
Speaker 1: It could be great, but it just falls so flat.

246
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:35,345
Speaker 1: But they knew.

247
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:44,354
Speaker 1: now the problem is is that wizard magazine is a journalistic Entity, you know, they write about comic books and other nerdy things.

248
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:46,321
Speaker 1: So there's nothing wrong with them Knowing.

249
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:50,496
Speaker 1: they also happen to be an exit a company that runs conventions.

250
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,420
Speaker 1: All right, not a big deal.

251
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:54,600
Speaker 1: They also happen to be a company that sells comic books.

252
00:15:55,222 --> 00:16:03,760
Speaker 1: They were selling this issue on eBay with many variant covers and all that jazz Before it hit shelves before it was delivered to stores.

253
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:10,200
Speaker 1: They knew in advance and they took advantage of that to make a bunch of money and rip people off on eBay.

254
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:11,225
Speaker 0: Good job.

255
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,613
Speaker 0: They probably found out some.

256
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:17,578
Speaker 0: while I guess it well I'll bet it wasn't that hard for people in the industry to find out if they really needed to.

257
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:25,785
Speaker 1: yeah Well, this particular incident, you know is kind of sketchy if you care and I personally don't care because it's such small Stupidity that it doesn't matter.

258
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:30,360
Speaker 1: but there are other instances where this sort of activity is not so hot.

259
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,676
Speaker 1: That's why we have laws against insider trading and that's why a lot of people are worried about.

260
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:49,706
Speaker 1: like video game magazines We're like at one point game Pro might have made a video game and people were like, oh no if they do that, then it'll all be journalistic integrity and You know sketchy insider Jobins that are no good,

261
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:52,660
Speaker 0: but the video game review industry is already like that.

262
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,054
Speaker 0: Even if PC gamer made games, it wouldn't be any different from how it is now.

263
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,279
Speaker 0: I know so I've never heard these concerns.

264
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:01,486
Speaker 1: people have expressed these concerns.

265
00:17:01,526 --> 00:17:07,213
Speaker 1: people are talking about like what if GameStop made a game and that they also have Game Informer magazine and They own the store.

266
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:07,660
Speaker 0: You know what?

267
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:10,880
Speaker 0: They all that they just wouldn't have to bribe themselves.

268
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,714
Speaker 0: Usually you have to bribe someone to get them to give you a good review now.

269
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:14,680
Speaker 0: I just don't have to do anything.

270
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:24,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just sort of like, you know like what if the New York Times published a book and then he did a book review on it saying that's fine book ever because You know who made the game and you know who's reviewing it.

271
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,279
Speaker 0: So there's no problem at all.

272
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,185
Speaker 1: The thing is most people don't know.

273
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:29,229
Speaker 1: we went to GameStop.

274
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:33,198
Speaker 1: the guy at GameStop didn't even know the Game Informer was made by GameStop.

275
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:34,403
Speaker 1: Remember that?

276
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

277
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,111
Speaker 0: I guess I just care so little.

278
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:37,793
Speaker 0: I mean I've never.

279
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,599
Speaker 1: I also care so little but it's just.

280
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:44,499
Speaker 1: you know there is an issue here of Being ethical and such.

281
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:51,260
Speaker 0: I don't really see much of an ethics problem because it was a secret and if it depends if it got out secretly or not.

282
00:17:51,300 --> 00:18:00,120
Speaker 0: But even if it was done blatantly in order to make money I still don't see much wrong with it because it's not like this was anything that mattered in the world.

283
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:02,347
Speaker 0: This was just that I literature.

284
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,353
Speaker 1: I agree that it was something that matters.

285
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:05,496
Speaker 1: Absolutely not.

286
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:14,860
Speaker 0: but it is a case of using Information to gain an unfair advantage, but at what point does in using information to gain an advantage become unfair?

287
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:17,819
Speaker 0: What if you're just smarter than everyone else and you figure it out?

288
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,527
Speaker 1: That is the important question, isn't it?

289
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:25,000
Speaker 0: or what if you find out and then you realize you can capitalize on it?

290
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,170
Speaker 0: What if you find out by espionage?

291
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:29,160
Speaker 0: What if you find out by murdering someone?

292
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,340
Speaker 1: There's this whole slide the murdering in the espionage here at unethical to begin with.

293
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,679
Speaker 0: What if you're going through?

294
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,566
Speaker 0: Marvel's public garbage?

295
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:40,535
Speaker 0: because it's perfectly legal in most cases to go through someone's garbage.

296
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:41,478
Speaker 1: That's true.

297
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:42,080
Speaker 1: That's true.

298
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:46,111
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it all depends on the circuit because remember a trade secret.

299
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:49,560
Speaker 0: the onus of protecting a trade secret is on the company.

300
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,359
Speaker 0: Who has the secret?

301
00:18:50,820 --> 00:19:02,135
Speaker 0: So if you accidentally reveal or if you leave of like the test issue in the garbage and someone finds it You're at fault and you can't sue the person who releases it to the world in most cases.

302
00:19:02,617 --> 00:19:03,380
Speaker 1: That is correct.

303
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:13,843
Speaker 1: However, if someone comes in and takes your trade secret or like if they worked for you and then they reveal the trade secret without You telling them to only if they signed an NDA that's true They have to sign.

304
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:15,308
Speaker 1: that says they will not tell the trade.

305
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:18,159
Speaker 0: surprisingly my new company didn't really make me sign any NDA's.

306
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:20,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't have to sign too much at my current.

307
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:22,788
Speaker 0: I had to sign stuff for hospitals.

308
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:27,087
Speaker 0: all the you know various requirements for not giving outpatient information But anything else.

309
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:27,469
Speaker 0: I'm really.

310
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,180
Speaker 0: it's fair game if I wanted to talk about it.

311
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:31,677
Speaker 1: I mean I signed the non-compete and the don't.

312
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:34,787
Speaker 1: ah Compete and ice also signed the don't.

313
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:38,320
Speaker 1: you know poach the employees if you quit but it only lasts six months.

314
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,265
Speaker 1: So it's not a big deal.

315
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,973
Speaker 0: I would never sign a non-compete.

316
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,672
Speaker 0: I would not work for a company That would make me sign a non-compete.

317
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:44,580
Speaker 1: It's not a big deal.

318
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,700
Speaker 1: It's saying if you leave here, you can't work for someone else who does the exact same thing.

319
00:19:50,183 --> 00:19:51,755
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, what exactly did it say?

320
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:52,360
Speaker 0: Did you have a lawyer?

321
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,555
Speaker 0: Look, it actually said competitors and that that could be interpreted broadly.

322
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:57,198
Speaker 0: I would have a lawyer.

323
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:57,660
Speaker 0: look at it.

324
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,085
Speaker 1: I'm not worried about it.

325
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:01,113
Speaker 0: I just in general won't sign non-competes.

326
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:02,719
Speaker 0: IBM had one and I just didn't sign it.

327
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:10,379
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

328
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:17,062
Speaker 0: So we were catching up on all those dig videos that we missed since we didn't have the internet for a while and one of Them caught our eye.

329
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:20,431
Speaker 0: It was entitled first erotic film now.

330
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:22,737
Speaker 1: We that's gonna really catch your eye.

331
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:23,780
Speaker 1: the first erotic.

332
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:26,260
Speaker 0: Well part of it was that it wasn't that long ago.

333
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:37,872
Speaker 0: We went to the New York Sex Museum and we not only saw effectively the first erotic film But we also saw the first erotic animation one of the first erotic animations But perhaps also the most hilarious erotic and it is.

334
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:39,277
Speaker 0: it is so high quality.

335
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:41,306
Speaker 0: if there was a DVD I would probably buy it.

336
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:42,914
Speaker 1: Maybe there is a DVD.

337
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,180
Speaker 0: We should look anyway.

338
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:47,138
Speaker 0: So we assume that this is probably one of the things we saw at the museum.

339
00:20:47,641 --> 00:21:02,360
Speaker 0: We click on it and not to spoil anything but it is not that it is in fact an animation a rather recent one from the Anisee film festival in France an animation festival and it is done by this guy Gabby Liddon's in 2002.

340
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:11,299
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was actually submitted to the festival or if it was a promotion for the festival But it is rather hilarious and it is actually pretty much safe for work.

341
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:15,212
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you get fired for watching this at work, you shouldn't be working.

342
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,420
Speaker 1: That's not someplace you want to work at all.

343
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:23,980
Speaker 1: And yeah, this this video is not will be expected and it was a thousand hilarities and it was really short.

344
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:24,603
Speaker 1: It was just like.

345
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:28,540
Speaker 1: it was like a one-liner joke turned into like a 10-second animation.

346
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:31,876
Speaker 0: I mean the first half is kind of a. do you get the joke yet?

347
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:32,660
Speaker 0: Do you get the joke yet?

348
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,630
Speaker 0: Do you get the joke yet?

349
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:37,453
Speaker 0: Ah Now you get the joke and then there's another joke the end.

350
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:39,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's awesome.

351
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:40,064
Speaker 1: Everyone should watch it.

352
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:42,954
Speaker 1: unless you're I don't know everyone should watch it.

353
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:54,674
Speaker 1: if you're listening to this show There is no way this would bother you That's true alright, so remember Lensman guy the Doc Smith who wrote all the lens.

354
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:55,217
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

355
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:55,498
Speaker 1: Yeah.

356
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:57,779
Speaker 0: Yeah I wasn't sure if you meant the director of the anime?

357
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:01,012
Speaker 1: Oh, no, the director of the anime can goes dying a fire.

358
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:02,157
Speaker 0: who did direct that.

359
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:02,980
Speaker 1: That's a good question.

360
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,839
Speaker 1: We'll look that up later.

361
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:27,820
Speaker 1: but anyway The guy who wrote lensman deep doc EE Smith, I think actually EE stands for Edward Elmer one of his books namely Triplanetary which is the first book in the lensman series Chronologically speaking, but it's I think the fifth book in terms of When it was published, so you're actually supposed to read it fifth.

362
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:31,139
Speaker 1: So I haven't read it yet because I've only read three lensman books.

363
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:35,720
Speaker 1: However, this book is on project Gutenberg now.

364
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:39,620
Speaker 1: But that's not the news because that you know big deal of a book is on project Gutenberg.

365
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:45,097
Speaker 1: I noticed two interesting things about this particular project Gutenberg release number one.

366
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:49,696
Speaker 1: It says Copyright status not copyrighted in the United States.

367
00:22:49,816 --> 00:22:53,167
Speaker 1: if you live elsewhere I checked the laws of your country before downloading this ebook.

368
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,380
Speaker 1: I have a copy of the book published in the United States.

369
00:22:58,203 --> 00:23:05,560
Speaker 1: so Either that person gave up the copyright because they had it at one point or I don't know but that's sort of dubious.

370
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:12,312
Speaker 0: Well, maybe the publisher here just had the right to publish it But the copyright still expires regardless of who we've given rights to.

371
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,340
Speaker 1: that could be true because it is very old.

372
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:19,333
Speaker 1: The second thing I noticed they didn't just put the words of the book online.

373
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:26,800
Speaker 1: if you look at this in HTML format These books all these lensman books weren't originally novels.

374
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:32,360
Speaker 1: They're originally pulp serials with like a chapter to every week in some magazine.

375
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:42,000
Speaker 1: they actually put the chapters from the magazines up there and the Pictures the illustrations that were in the original pulp magazines up there as well, huh?

376
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,680
Speaker 0: Did he do the illustrations or did he hire?

377
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:49,180
Speaker 1: I don't know who did the illustrations but they're there on the project Gutenberg if you read it in HTML format, huh?

378
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,959
Speaker 1: and that is way cool because pulp literature magazines do not exist anymore.

379
00:23:54,979 --> 00:24:03,080
Speaker 1: and Reading these kinds of stories now you get them in novel paperback books and you don't realize that they were originally.

380
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:07,916
Speaker 1: You know serialized pulp action and see the original stuff that was there and I don't know.

381
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:09,100
Speaker 0: it depends on the thing.

382
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:15,100
Speaker 0: I mean I could not but I could not bring myself to read the Count of Monte Cristo in its original form.

383
00:24:15,783 --> 00:24:18,859
Speaker 1: Oh, what is the real French but serialized?

384
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:27,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean if it's serialized, but you have all the bits in one big HTML file Then it's no different than reading it in the book form.

385
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:32,474
Speaker 1: Yeah But it has it You know split up in the correct fashion and the and all the original pictures are there.

386
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:39,860
Speaker 1: instead of like I have some different Publishings of some of the different lensman books and the art is all completely different for the covers and stuff.

387
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:43,897
Speaker 1: So having the original art is sort of different from how.

388
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:44,198
Speaker 0: I guess.

389
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:45,463
Speaker 0: if there's art There's a big difference.

390
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:50,622
Speaker 0: but aside from art if something was published in one format and I read it in another format that doesn't bother Me at all.

391
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:57,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus it's sort of a. it's like a presence of art where the only art I have for the lensman books I've got is the covers and this.

392
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:02,719
Speaker 1: there was some inside illustrations that you never would have seen and it's pretty cool Are they good?

393
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're actually pretty interesting.

394
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:16,594
Speaker 1: like because sometimes you have a hard time and lensman figuring out like what the ships look like and what certain aliens look like because he describes them but he doesn't describe them in super detail.

395
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:20,388
Speaker 1: like he'll say like there's a Slimy appendage or something you got it.

396
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,276
Speaker 1: It could be any kind of slimy appendage.

397
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:24,126
Speaker 1: It could be a pseudopod It could be a tentacle.

398
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:25,837
Speaker 1: It could be a big tentacle small tentacle.

399
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,860
Speaker 1: You're not always a hundred percent sure and you kind of get a picture over time of what the things look like.

400
00:25:32,223 --> 00:25:41,620
Speaker 1: But it's it's not always easy to tell You know He spends a lot more time talking about these sizes and powers of things and that you get the general feel for what something's like.

401
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:47,440
Speaker 1: But not everyone has a different picture because the you know, the it's not the most adjective filled.

402
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:56,113
Speaker 0: All right That's the exact opposite of the Count of Monte Cristo which describes an intricate detail every object ever Presented to use over the course of the novel.

403
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:57,039
Speaker 0: That's why it's so long.

404
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, lensman reads pretty fast and it's pretty fun.

405
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:09,287
Speaker 0: So tonight we're going to preview we haven't done that in a while and anime that we have only seen a few episodes of Suffice to say we have.

406
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:18,480
Speaker 0: we're suitably impressed by it to where we feel the need to talk about it And also we get the sense that a lot of people have passed it by or haven't recognized that it exists.

407
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:26,168
Speaker 1: Well, it was on the air in April and to June 2006 which means that's probably when it would have been a bit.

408
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:35,324
Speaker 1: Torrance and I usually download episode 1 of just about anything And if I had downloaded this episode 1 I probably would have kept watching it I don't know.

409
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:37,052
Speaker 0: you seem to give shows off in.

410
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:37,313
Speaker 0: the.

411
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:41,900
Speaker 0: look at it for two seconds You see one character you don't like and you say this show is crap and deleted.

412
00:26:42,121 --> 00:26:46,220
Speaker 1: But if I would have seen these it's kind of hard to watch the first episode without seeing outer space.

413
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,777
Speaker 0: You know watch the first episode you would have clicked through seen two pretty silver-haired boys And so this is crap and deleted it.

414
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:54,159
Speaker 0: I know You've done that to other shows.

415
00:26:54,901 --> 00:27:02,407
Speaker 1: Yeah shows where I go click click click and I see some moe girls and then I see and it's pretty obvious what the show Are and I don't have to actually watch them.

416
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:06,360
Speaker 0: So tonight we're gonna talk a bit about duo say or Planet of the Beast King.

417
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:11,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's hard to figure out exactly the correct Romanization of the name.

418
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:13,934
Speaker 0: I mean, well, it's only it's not difficult.

419
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:15,300
Speaker 0: It's just that they listed here twice.

420
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:17,890
Speaker 1: Well, I've seen it spelled like three or four different ways.

421
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,577
Speaker 0: Oh because the internet knows what it's talking.

422
00:27:19,698 --> 00:27:22,866
Speaker 1: I know right I've seen people say three separate words Jew.

423
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,532
Speaker 1: Oh say I've seen Jew.

424
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:27,998
Speaker 1: Oh say j-u-u-o-u-s-e-i.

425
00:27:29,241 --> 00:27:30,565
Speaker 0: Never seen anything other than those twos.

426
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:31,609
Speaker 0: I don't know what you're talking about.

427
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:36,460
Speaker 1: I saw one that was like j-y-u-u-s-e-o-e some fan summer?

428
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:38,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, not so good.

429
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:43,420
Speaker 0: It's directed by Hiroshi Nishikiori who you might know from Azumanga Daioh.

430
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:45,223
Speaker 0: Oh really?

431
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:47,351
Speaker 0: Not that it's anything like Azumanga Daioh.

432
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:49,840
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's not like Azumanga Daioh at all.

433
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,860
Speaker 0: Now we're gonna spoil things from the first episode later on so we'll warn you in progression.

434
00:27:55,022 --> 00:28:03,969
Speaker 0: So once we'll tell you when we're gonna spoil stuff We'll hold off for a bit because the reason that we like this show is Basically a spoiler for the very beginning of the show.

435
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:08,003
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think we should spoil that in this episode But we can.

436
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:13,580
Speaker 0: definitely we'll have to spoil where the plot goes because it starts in one place and ends up somewhere.

437
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty impossible to spoil.

438
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:24,740
Speaker 1: and if we don't spoil that you really can't do a faithful review of this show because You you won't really know what the show is about if I only tell you first episode stuff.

439
00:28:25,081 --> 00:28:29,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but to go over very briefly what the plot is we're gonna talk more about our impressions of it.

440
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,890
Speaker 0: It is two brothers twin brothers Thor and Rai.

441
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:36,160
Speaker 0: They are silver-haired pretty boys living in a space station.

442
00:28:36,742 --> 00:28:37,545
Speaker 0: They are very young.

443
00:28:37,786 --> 00:28:39,312
Speaker 0: their parents are obviously bigwigs.

444
00:28:39,754 --> 00:28:41,400
Speaker 0: They you know, they're at a museum or something.

445
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,720
Speaker 0: They're living their normal lives and you expect this to be some sort of silver-haired boys in space drama.

446
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:49,700
Speaker 1: I expected it to be sort of like a Gundam type of thing.

447
00:28:49,781 --> 00:29:01,798
Speaker 1: Maybe you know like they're gonna do there They have they're so smart and they're so great at sports and everything and they're gonna somehow become Action military heroes of some sort and fight other guys in space.

448
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:07,300
Speaker 0: Yep Well three of the genres listed on anime news network are in fact adventure drama and military.

449
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:13,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you watch five minutes of this show and if you've seen anime before you know where that shows going.

450
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,445
Speaker 1: That's what you're thinking.

451
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:16,880
Speaker 1: You can't imagine anything else happening with this show.

452
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:20,716
Speaker 0: So I expected it to be a generic show but Emily had highly recommended it.

453
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:25,308
Speaker 0: Emily was watching it in fact, she'd seen most of it and She's got all of it here and we're.

454
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:30,530
Speaker 0: so we all sat down since she wanted to show it to us and we watched the First episode and it starts out in this generic way.

455
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,434
Speaker 0: So, huh?

456
00:29:31,454 --> 00:29:32,759
Speaker 0: I wonder why she likes this so much.

457
00:29:33,202 --> 00:29:48,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean it started out in a generic way but I was already hooked because there are just so few anime these days that aren't a moe show or a harem show or A furry show or any of those sorts of you know high school craps.

458
00:29:49,242 --> 00:29:57,132
Speaker 1: So I was like finally someone decided to make another sci-fi show other than ergo proxy Which is the other recent sci-fi show the other one that we have to finish watching.

459
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,100
Speaker 1: Yes, so I'm like, yes a sci-fi show.

460
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,814
Speaker 1: I must support this show and watch it just so we get more real shows.

461
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:12,499
Speaker 0: now you do get the sense the Coordinator sense you look at these kids and the way they act and the way they talk and you would think while they're obviously genetically augmented in some way to be badasses.

462
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:18,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I looked at him and I was like, alright, so what did they do to these kids to make them all weird?

463
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,709
Speaker 1: What are their special abilities?

464
00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:21,460
Speaker 1: You know, I was just waiting for it to show up.

465
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,974
Speaker 1: I was like, you know, why is their hair white and their eyes all perfect?

466
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:26,560
Speaker 1: and you know, tell me the plot.

467
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,416
Speaker 1: I already see it a mile away and you haven't even said one word about it.

468
00:30:29,939 --> 00:30:39,680
Speaker 0: now You know a show like this that it takes a while for the plot to develop and you there's a certain pace to this sort Of things, you know, there's gonna be an episode or two or generic whatever hinting at the plot.

469
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:41,324
Speaker 0: Then the event will happen.

470
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:43,831
Speaker 0: the event like the Gundam appears.

471
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:48,667
Speaker 0: that causes them to break out of their normal lives and have their Gundam inspired life.

472
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:51,680
Speaker 0: and then the real plot starts, you know seven episodes after that.

473
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:55,114
Speaker 0: Then there's the recap episode around episode 14 or 15.

474
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,660
Speaker 1: take that Archduke Ferdinand.

475
00:30:59,263 --> 00:31:04,008
Speaker 0: So this show pretty much skips all of that and Immediately jumps to the meat.

476
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:11,640
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is the meat is Most of the show as far as I can tell and the meat is not what you think you're gonna get.

477
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,728
Speaker 1: It's sort of like a jelly doughnut.

478
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:19,948
Speaker 1: You see the doughnut and you say ah Doughnut and you imagine sugary fried dough.

479
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:24,240
Speaker 1: you bite it and you taste sugary fried dough, but not a second later.

480
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:28,975
Speaker 1: Jelly filling and most of what you get for the next 20. how many episodes?

481
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:29,938
Speaker 1: is it 26?

482
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:30,580
Speaker 0: Here's the other thing.

483
00:31:30,925 --> 00:31:31,634
Speaker 0: It's only 11 episodes.

484
00:31:32,502 --> 00:31:35,639
Speaker 1: So the most of what you get for the next 11 episodes is gonna be jelly.

485
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:40,140
Speaker 1: and Then at the end on the other side of the doughnut, there's a bit more frosting.

486
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:52,548
Speaker 0: See, I would say that's a bad analogy just for me personally because I really don't like jelly doughnuts I know but I'm tied off like a blow pop, you know Pops you just seem don't don't like anything.

487
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:53,632
Speaker 1: that works as an analogy.

488
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:54,114
Speaker 1: Do you all right?

489
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:55,820
Speaker 0: How about a Boston cream doughnut?

490
00:31:56,261 --> 00:32:00,199
Speaker 1: All right, you bite it expecting doughnut and then it's mostly just cream.

491
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:03,672
Speaker 1: But you didn't think it was gonna be cream because you didn't know.

492
00:32:04,194 --> 00:32:05,700
Speaker 0: so we'll avoid spoiling it for a bit.

493
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:12,060
Speaker 0: I really want to mention the opening theme deep in your heart by Koichi Domoto.

494
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:21,294
Speaker 0: I don't know who they are anything, but it's not the kind of music I've heard coming out of Japan Maybe because I haven't looked very much lately recently and I really like it.

495
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:22,478
Speaker 1: I kind of like it.

496
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:22,980
Speaker 1: It's a good one.

497
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:28,943
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not one of those amazing openers of all time like German Sailor Moon But it's.

498
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:32,660
Speaker 1: but it's not one of those bad painful openers like ah, I just skip over it.

499
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,860
Speaker 1: You know, I would if I was watching this on DVD since there's only 11 episodes.

500
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,520
Speaker 1: I might actually watch the opener all 11 times.

501
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:44,080
Speaker 0: There are only a few shows will do that for I mean ghost in the shell standalone complex first and second gig.

502
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,529
Speaker 0: We watch the opener every time Gundam seed.

503
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:49,300
Speaker 0: I watch the opener every time I started skipping it towards the end.

504
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,663
Speaker 0: Just cuz.

505
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:51,680
Speaker 1: well just cuz you know, you're getting it in the heat.

506
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:57,479
Speaker 0: But yeah also because once you get to the last opener It's it's actually not as good as some of the openers before it.

507
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:01,608
Speaker 1: Yeah That when you have five different openers It's hard for them all to be so great.

508
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,159
Speaker 1: the fact that all of them are as great as they are is a miracle.

509
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:13,196
Speaker 0: Utena I watched the opener most of the time and I watched the closer The second half like when they got to the good opener at the end.

510
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:15,366
Speaker 1: Well in a ten I'll always watch the closer.

511
00:33:15,446 --> 00:33:17,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, the opener the opener I will.

512
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:18,340
Speaker 1: I will skip some time.

513
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:20,713
Speaker 0: It depended on the episode or what was going on.

514
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:21,820
Speaker 1: It does depend a lot.

515
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:23,928
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's one of those shows where I like the open.

516
00:33:23,988 --> 00:33:31,665
Speaker 0: also the show is very prettily animated It's not I wouldn't say it's very friendly Compared to like.

517
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:35,240
Speaker 0: it starts out like one of those guns those shows where it's animated pretty like it's really good.

518
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,627
Speaker 0: It looks good and shiny.

519
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks like the best, you know, Gonzo's good works.

520
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:42,960
Speaker 0: That's what it looks like, but it doesn't seem to decline like all those guns.

521
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,867
Speaker 1: Oh, how many episodes we watch.

522
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:47,920
Speaker 0: like five or six or Emily's seen almost all of it.

523
00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:50,010
Speaker 0: She seems to have a high opinion of it.

524
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,140
Speaker 1: still it didn't seem to decline at all.

525
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:58,860
Speaker 1: Every episode seemed to be equally animated Although they were drawing very different things in the first episode compared to the other episodes.

526
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:17,799
Speaker 0: Yes though it is a good credit to this show that it starts with this one world then it throws you into this whole other business and Yet after about ten minutes of watching that other business you almost forget about the original plot entirely And you get so immersed in what's going on now that you just totally forget what's actually going on.

527
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:22,697
Speaker 1: I just really hope they go back to the original plot at the end, which they almost have to.

528
00:34:22,717 --> 00:34:26,857
Speaker 1: you know The way the show is going but it's the same thing that brave story did.

529
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:27,340
Speaker 0: where?

530
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,958
Speaker 0: There's the original plot and then the show kind of like in The Simpsons will have the beginning plot than the real plot.

531
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:43,213
Speaker 0: yeah, so you're watching and you get drawn into this other world where you don't care about what was going on in the beginning and You're so immersed in it that you forget that there's this whole other plot thread.

532
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:45,380
Speaker 0: That's actually the driving force of the show.

533
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,835
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's actually sort of the opposite of The Simpsons because The Simpsons.

534
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:55,098
Speaker 1: they have the opening plot Which isn't the real plot of the episode and then they get to the real plot.

535
00:34:55,339 --> 00:35:10,933
Speaker 1: true This is the opening plot that they give you in the beginning is the real plot and then you're on sort of this Like journey in order to get back to the plot through the whole show and then at the end Supposedly, I hope you get back to it, but I don't know.

536
00:35:10,953 --> 00:35:12,100
Speaker 1: I haven't seen the end, huh?

537
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:20,030
Speaker 0: Talked about The Simpsons and Jelly Donuts in one show Mmm Donut RDRR Okay, okay.

538
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:30,799
Speaker 0: All right We're going to spoil at this point pretty much the first plot development in the entire show Which happens almost immediately in the first episode.

539
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:38,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's kids in space and they're they're obviously very smart and young and in school and whatever.

540
00:35:38,298 --> 00:35:38,980
Speaker 0: and there's all this.

541
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,699
Speaker 0: You know all the typical they're talking about.

542
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:44,297
Speaker 0: Oh, it'd be nice to be on a planet with a sky.

543
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:48,491
Speaker 0: Oh They live in a space colony and there's a lot of atmosphere.

544
00:35:48,531 --> 00:35:54,060
Speaker 0: like you see the sky and then later from a different angle You realize that the sky is actually kind of painted onto the ceiling.

545
00:35:54,461 --> 00:36:07,979
Speaker 1: yeah, and there's two brothers and they're obviously special and their parents are like high ups in the government involved in sort of important science type stuff and There's some genetic stuff that they're obviously modified and better in some way.

546
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:15,339
Speaker 1: But even though they're twins one of them seems to be smart and Athletic and the other one seems to be kind of wussy, but smart.

547
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:19,391
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of them is definitely the whiny annoying kind of guy.

548
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,496
Speaker 1: He the ray is the annoying right?

549
00:36:21,536 --> 00:36:23,483
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the up Thor Yes.

550
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:23,966
Speaker 0: All right.

551
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:24,127
Speaker 0: Yes.

552
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:26,520
Speaker 0: See we've got Thor and ride.

553
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:34,673
Speaker 1: There's a lot of Norse references in this show like they say They mentioned Odin and they mention all sorts of crazy.

554
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,900
Speaker 0: There's a lot of mythological references in general.

555
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:46,620
Speaker 0: I mean if they're talking about all the different names of planets and colonies and everything and pay attention to that I'm not sure how much that's going to come into play.

556
00:36:46,902 --> 00:36:50,000
Speaker 1: I'm willing to bet Loki shows up at the end in some symbolic way.

557
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,560
Speaker 1: I mean, it would be so hard not to do that that it's almost inevitable if you pay attention at all.

558
00:36:56,362 --> 00:37:01,337
Speaker 0: So they go home after being at the museum or whatever they were at and right away something's wrong.

559
00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:02,260
Speaker 0: the doors unlocked.

560
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:06,272
Speaker 0: Confident brother starts to handle the situation goes in to see what's going on.

561
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:07,997
Speaker 0: whiny brother follows him in.

562
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:09,180
Speaker 1: the house is dark.

563
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,926
Speaker 1: Nobody's making any noise.

564
00:37:10,966 --> 00:37:11,849
Speaker 1: what's going on?

565
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,253
Speaker 1: Where did our parents go?

566
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:17,339
Speaker 0: They're supposed to be home come around the corner Oh snaps parents are dead.

567
00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:20,229
Speaker 1: This is pretty much the first thing that happens in the show.

568
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:27,420
Speaker 1: now in other anime that might be the last thing that happens in The show or that would be the thing that happens at the end of the third episode.

569
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:31,420
Speaker 1: Yes, this is something that happens in the middle of the first episode.

570
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:32,384
Speaker 1: So that's that's.

571
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:35,720
Speaker 1: you got quite big balls to kill the parents right away like that.

572
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, not only that but kids are then kidnapped by shadowy people with various gases.

573
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,880
Speaker 1: I mean killing the parents is not like the climax of a plot arc or the mo or like.

574
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,200
Speaker 1: The thing is that thing that finally breaks a straw that gets the character to do what they're supposed to do.

575
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:55,330
Speaker 1: It's the impetus for the whole rest of the thing.

576
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:58,000
Speaker 1: without that happening the whole rest of the show wouldn't happen.

577
00:37:58,362 --> 00:38:01,720
Speaker 0: You know what it is every RPG for a Nintendo system ever.

578
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,580
Speaker 0: You know you start and the parents were just dead and you're living with the uncle or the dead disappeared or something.

579
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:12,136
Speaker 0: This show just started one day before all those RPGs start.

580
00:38:12,518 --> 00:38:13,180
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

581
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:13,682
Speaker 1: You're right.

582
00:38:13,984 --> 00:38:24,505
Speaker 1: instead of you know, waking up when your mom wakes you up and then you know Your mom gets killed by the evil sorcerer the next day while you're at school or your link and you wake up in Malin and House and you don't have parents.

583
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:29,440
Speaker 1: this is you know, hell you freaking your parents or die right in the first episode.

584
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:30,384
Speaker 1: It's good stuff.

585
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:34,440
Speaker 0: So then they wait you wait, they wake up and they're on this planet.

586
00:38:34,822 --> 00:38:38,840
Speaker 1: Well, no some guys come and attack them and then well, I already said that they got kidnapped.

587
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:39,363
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

588
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,911
Speaker 1: They got kidnapped and they wake up right now.

589
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:42,480
Speaker 0: This is where the show begins in earnest.

590
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:47,200
Speaker 0: They wake up on this planet and it's obviously a planet blue skies, whatever.

591
00:38:47,883 --> 00:38:51,296
Speaker 0: It's not exactly the kind of place they're used to being in.

592
00:38:51,356 --> 00:39:05,853
Speaker 0: it is effectively this harsh inhospitable deadly jungle filled with the derelicts of society who have been cast aside to this Effectively from what you would gather a prison planet or an exile planet to fend for themselves.

593
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:07,538
Speaker 0: It's a super dangerous world.

594
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:09,447
Speaker 0: the play There's no animals.

595
00:39:09,628 --> 00:39:11,900
Speaker 0: There's all plants and the plants are super deadly.

596
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:15,460
Speaker 1: I think that's actually the number one thing that makes this show pretty cool.

597
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,080
Speaker 1: Is that the world that most of the story takes place on is just an awesome world.

598
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:24,080
Speaker 1: I mean the plants in this place are so wildly varied.

599
00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:29,618
Speaker 1: It's like it's like if your whole planet was covered with Cthulhu type plants and they're all different and they're all.

600
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:35,659
Speaker 1: some of them are useful and they always sort of come in at just the right moment as useful plot devices.

601
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:37,009
Speaker 1: and It's all.

602
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:38,179
Speaker 1: the plants are pretty awesome.

603
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:44,086
Speaker 1: Like there's one kind of plant that like totally destroys the city But it brings water from underground.

604
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:45,030
Speaker 1: it lets them live.

605
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,452
Speaker 1: or

606
00:39:45,472 --> 00:39:47,439
Speaker 0: there's the one with the super poisonous bits

607
00:39:48,121 --> 00:40:01,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like it's pretty cool because people they stress right away as soon as you're as soon as they start meeting the prisoners and People on this planet that if you know more about the plants then you will get ahead in this world.

608
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,187
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they show you that.

609
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:06,200
Speaker 1: yes, that is the case if you know about the plants and pay attention to them.

610
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:07,965
Speaker 1: That's the key to survival.

611
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:17,133
Speaker 0: See you can effectively call this show an exercise in Darwinism Because the people that are on this planet have adapted and it is a rough.

612
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:18,960
Speaker 0: only the fit survive.

613
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:26,940
Speaker 0: In fact here only the strong survive the ones who throw away their humanity and become the beasts humans once were.

614
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:30,371
Speaker 0: Yep, that's from the plot summary on anime news network.

615
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:33,080
Speaker 1: That's pretty much sums it up right there.

616
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:34,845
Speaker 0: So they run afoul of people here.

617
00:40:34,885 --> 00:40:39,800
Speaker 0: There's there's a bunch of tribes of people that have kind of formed on various parts of this planet.

618
00:40:40,743 --> 00:40:47,342
Speaker 1: They divided up themselves into rings like the Sun ring and the something else ring like all kinds of rings You know.

619
00:40:47,422 --> 00:40:57,189
Speaker 1: and and basically they have this ranking system or whoever's the strongest is in charge of the ring And you'd be like number one or number two or number three I gotta say the third.

620
00:40:57,209 --> 00:40:58,760
Speaker 0: the guy we meet is really cool.

621
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:02,297
Speaker 1: I think it's one of the best characters in the show him and the girl you meet right away.

622
00:41:02,317 --> 00:41:12,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Then there's someone who's the Beast King, you know and to be the Beast King You have to be the leader of all the Rings and only the Beast King can leave the planet.

623
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,787
Speaker 1: But they don't tell you how.

624
00:41:14,169 --> 00:41:15,576
Speaker 1: and it's sort of this mystery like,

625
00:41:15,696 --> 00:41:34,020
Speaker 0: uh, yeah you get this idea that there's obviously this fighting for who gets to lead the Rings and who what's going on and there's obviously this Quest or you could fight and become the leader of this planet and the leader seems to get a special privilege where he can return To their you know, the actual civilized world or something like that because otherwise there's no way off this planet.

626
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:37,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a pretty typical Anime type of set up.

627
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:39,020
Speaker 0: there could easily be a shonen fighting show.

628
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,931
Speaker 1: it could easily be an RPG or shonen fighting show and You know, it leaves you wondering the whole time like huh?

629
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:45,554
Speaker 1: Howdy.

630
00:41:45,634 --> 00:41:47,000
Speaker 1: Is he gonna become the Beast King?

631
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,515
Speaker 1: Probably that's kind of obvious, but I don't know if he does yet.

632
00:41:50,535 --> 00:41:52,707
Speaker 1: I haven't seen that part so it's not really a spoiler.

633
00:41:52,868 --> 00:42:01,520
Speaker 0: but what I like so far is that the Situations that come up in the show as far as I've seen are not the straight-up stereotypical scenes in a lot of anime recently.

634
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,202
Speaker 0: They're very.

635
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:04,208
Speaker 0: you can't predict what's gonna happen.

636
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:08,100
Speaker 0: the characters react in pretty convincingly realistic ways.

637
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,608
Speaker 0: They don't react in expected ways all the time.

638
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:14,836
Speaker 0: They're the characters seem pretty well developed, especially for a little of the show I've seen so far.

639
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:20,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, the characters and the other thing is not only do the characters act in I mean, they're not the smartest character.

640
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:28,549
Speaker 1: Sometimes they do kind of stupid stuff, but they're all pretty cool like that nerdy guy with the glasses Yeah, who has like no interested in being the leader.

641
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:29,573
Speaker 1: He's a cool guy.

642
00:42:29,593 --> 00:42:32,344
Speaker 1: the guy who's actually the number one Was really cool.

643
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:45,119
Speaker 1: that like that the one fight scene though like the one real Shonen style fight scene that we saw was actually really awesome because it was short and it said Aha, the smart guy beats the big guy.

644
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:49,680
Speaker 0: I think part of what makes this show good so far seems to be that it's 11 episodes.

645
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:51,648
Speaker 0: So they've dispensed with filler.

646
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:54,420
Speaker 0: They've dispensed with anything that isn't necessary for the plot.

647
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:00,061
Speaker 0: It's just the plot the characters the mood and that's it and they're just plowing through Mm-hmm.

648
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:01,686
Speaker 1: another thing is this show.

649
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:06,200
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna spoil anything, but there are things that happen pretty early on in the show.

650
00:43:06,661 --> 00:43:15,199
Speaker 1: You know soon after the parents get killed we're talking like episode one two and three here Where I'm not gonna tell you what they are because there's no point watching the show.

651
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,383
Speaker 1: Suffice to say suffice to say the writers of this show have big nuts Like.

652
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:30,626
Speaker 1: there is stuff that no show would even think of doing in such an early point in the story And they just do it like BAM it's done and you're like, whoa, you can't do that There's no way you just did that.

653
00:43:30,747 --> 00:43:33,479
Speaker 1: Yes, and then the next episode you're thinking they did it.

654
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:38,220
Speaker 0: Something happens early on where I remember thinking to myself that didn't really happen.

655
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,251
Speaker 0: That's that's gonna be undone or that's that.

656
00:43:41,492 --> 00:43:42,275
Speaker 0: did that happen.

657
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:43,479
Speaker 0: Did they really do it?

658
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,786
Speaker 0: Wow, and I really couldn't believe it.

659
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:49,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then your couple episodes later, but at the same time it's done.

660
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:54,219
Speaker 0: I was cheering because that sort of thing is what I want out of anime these days.

661
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:56,939
Speaker 0: very It's rare now that an anime will surprise me.

662
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:13,399
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean that's what I liked about Anime in the first place when I started watching is that they had the kinds of plots and the kinds of stories that weren't in The other mediums that I was experiencing at the time, but now that I've seen enough anime I've seen all the anime plots there are to see.

663
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:20,149
Speaker 1: So when you come out with a new anime plot one that I haven't seen already It doesn't even have to be super awesome.

664
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:24,718
Speaker 1: It can just be really great like this one is and I'll go woohoo Something new all right.

665
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:30,462
Speaker 0: So I'm pretty much looking forward to watching the rest of the show and hopefully we'll do it this week or next week at the Latest.

666
00:44:30,824 --> 00:44:32,091
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean only 11 episodes.

667
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:33,640
Speaker 1: It can't take us that long to finish this thing.

668
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,791
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really doubt it's gonna have a US release anytime soon.

669
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:37,855
Speaker 0: So check it out.

670
00:44:37,895 --> 00:44:39,179
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can find a torrent somewhere.

671
00:44:40,121 --> 00:44:42,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe the torrent box or whatever box torrents, right?

672
00:44:43,121 --> 00:44:45,898
Speaker 1: They usually have torrents of like a whole series and there's only 11 episodes.

673
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:47,607
Speaker 1: So it won't take you that long to download.

674
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:56,300
Speaker 0: now, of course before we end for tonight I would like to point out one that last night's episode was actually uploaded today due to us getting our internet back.

675
00:44:56,642 --> 00:44:59,460
Speaker 0: So if you missed an episode yesterday tonight is a matinee.

676

Speaker 0: the contest for the worst anime you've ever seen is still going.

680
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:16,240
Speaker 0: Now just to clarify because people have just been sending us entries that were basically naming a bad anime.

681
00:45:16,843 --> 00:45:18,994
Speaker 0: Don't just tell me which anime is bad.

682
00:45:19,054 --> 00:45:20,120
Speaker 0: I know which anime is bad.

683
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,766
Speaker 0: I do a podcast about anime.

684
00:45:22,368 --> 00:45:24,355
Speaker 0: I need you to tell me why it's bad.

685
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:25,740
Speaker 0: I want a small essay.

686
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,904
Speaker 0: I want some humor here.

687
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:30,980
Speaker 0: We're basically gonna pick the best write-up not the worst anime for this prize.

688
00:45:31,584 --> 00:45:33,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that's the point of a contest.

689
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,187
Speaker 1: I mean anyone can name an anime.

690
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:40,200
Speaker 1: you don't win a prize for telling me that what I already know that Grey digital target is terrible.

691
00:45:41,504 --> 00:45:42,979
Speaker 1: You have to humor me.

692
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:47,015
Speaker 1: I should read some text that you have written and I should laugh.

693
00:45:47,276 --> 00:45:52,870
Speaker 1: and if I laugh at yours or if I am more entertained by yours or if I go oh shits That one is awesome.

694
00:45:53,393 --> 00:45:59,682
Speaker 1: Then you are going to win a prize for doing something for being cool Not just for writing down the name of an anime.

695
00:45:59,822 --> 00:46:05,544
Speaker 0: if you want an example of what we're looking for Listen to anime world orders review of MD guys.

Speaker 1: Oh great.

700
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:27,898
Speaker 1: Yes Maybe that's why no one's entering this contest cuz it's not worth writing an essay to win Soundtracks to bad anime.

701

Speaker 0: No, I think maybe I don't know because the contest for Thursday night Which has a yet to be determined prize.

00:46:42,778 --> 00:46:54,190
Speaker 1: and if you keep the people if you want us to have Contests and give away shit that we don't want then you should enter them because if no one enters our Contests then that tells us no one cares about them and we'll stop having them.

708
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:59,549
Speaker 0: Maybe after we finish the current Thursday contest, we should have a contest contest for whoever comes up with the best contest wins.

709
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:04,790
Speaker 1: We'll see how many people enter that contest and then decide whether they continue having contest.

710
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:11,156
Speaker 0: However, don't think you're clever because if you enter the contest contest and your idea is a contest contest You're not gonna win anything.

711
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:13,209
Speaker 1: Oh, what if your idea is a contest contest contest?

712
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:14,552
Speaker 0: That might.

713
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:16,280
Speaker 0: that might be in consideration.

714
00:47:17,364 --> 00:47:21,718
Speaker 1: Uh, oh well Jose is a show that you should watch.

715
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,525
Speaker 0: I'm very excited about it.

716
00:47:23,605 --> 00:47:24,910
Speaker 0: I really want to see how it ends.

717
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:40,848
Speaker 0: Emily has seen so much to where she knows a bunch of spoilers and apparently something horrible happened near the end Because I was standing in the room and she was watching it and I was avoiding the screen and luckily I don't understand enough Japanese, but I hear kind of this gooey squick noise followed by Emily going.

718
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:52,630
Speaker 1: Ah That was probably a plant doing something a plant Squish noise, it's probably a plant because the planet is covered in horrible nasty plants.

719
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,790
Speaker 0: Yes, and don't think that these are plants like tentacle monster hentai plants.

720
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,423
Speaker 0: These are plants like just bite you in half and that's the end.

721
00:47:59,865 --> 00:48:03,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, think of it like big planet of horrors instead of little shop.

722
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:06,034
Speaker 1: That's what this is.

723
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:08,122
Speaker 0: feed me see more.

724
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:09,627
Speaker 1: maybe that's the end of the anime.

725
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:10,350
Speaker 1: is the whole planet.

726
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,727
Speaker 1: It's just one big plant that eats you.

727
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:16,940
Speaker 0: Somehow I don't think the nature of the planet is going to be the plot.

728
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:19,808
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not gonna be a KO century beast.
