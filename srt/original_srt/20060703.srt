1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,001
Speaker 0: It's Monday July 3rd, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,630
Speaker 0: It's just me and I talked a little bit about podcast promotion.

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,762
Speaker 0: Let's do this Well while Scott and the rest of the crew are still at the beach.

4
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:23,770
Speaker 0: I am back in Beacon.

5
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:31,770
Speaker 0: I had to leave the beach a day and a half early to come back and go to work on Monday even though I get Tomorrow Tuesday off, but I guess no big deal.

6
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:34,790
Speaker 0: I'll just you know catch up on paperwork that I've been avoiding for the past.

7
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:37,429
Speaker 0: I don't know two years because I never have time to do anything.

8
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:49,890
Speaker 0: But I gotta say and we'll talk about this more on Tuesday We had one hell of a time at the beach and a big part of that was that the wild the boardwalk in Wildwood Which is you know south of Atlantic City near the bottom of New Jersey.

9
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:53,548
Speaker 0: It's always been for as long as I've been going there a bastion of DDR.

10
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,110
Speaker 0: I mean there are just tons and tons of DDR machines and all the whole DDR culture is down there.

11
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,710
Speaker 0: I mean there used to be a third mix Korean machine.

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,458
Speaker 0: It was 25 cents for five songs.

13
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:13,089
Speaker 0: fourth mix pluses everything and over time every machine was upgraded to an eighth mix machine and it got to the point where there was nothing but eight in the eighth mix.

14
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:19,190
Speaker 0: and As that happened and we kind of lost interest in DDR and if we didn't play it so much anymore.

15
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:24,067
Speaker 0: Now we went to the beach a few weeks ago And there were no new machines other than you know the in the groove.

16
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:27,810
Speaker 0: two machines Which whatever this time it's been have only been a few weeks.

17
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:35,102
Speaker 0: We come back to the beach and there are at least ten DDR ninth mix machines the newest newest DDR.

18
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:37,730
Speaker 0: This is the dance dance revolution from Japan.

19
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:40,221
Speaker 0: It was shipped freshly to the United States.

20
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:42,010
Speaker 0: These were brand new machines.

21
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:51,649
Speaker 0: I'd never played on a brand new DDR machine in my life And I gotta say all of us our interest in DDR has been fully rekindled and we played until our feet hurt.

22
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:58,730
Speaker 0: Now also in addition to that I've noticed that the boardwalk seems to very slowly be getting bits of geek into it.

23
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:01,301
Speaker 0: I mean there's all this DDR and all the good arcade games.

24
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:08,318
Speaker 0: I mean Wildwood has some of the best arcades I've been to since I was a little kid and They have put an internet cafe with kind of a Starbucks in it.

25
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:18,957
Speaker 0: recently and just now as we were walking down the boardwalk We noticed an empty abandoned Well not abandoned but empty and being remodeled storefront And there's a big sign on the door.

26
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:24,230
Speaker 0: two of them that said the word noob and it was crossed off like, you know No noobs allowed.

27
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:29,290
Speaker 0: So intrigued we run up and we appear in the window and it appears to be some sort of LAN gaming place.

28
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:31,277
Speaker 0: I guess I was just surprised to see something.

29
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:39,900
Speaker 0: So nerdy as a LAN gaming place in the middle of a Generally, I don't really want to say lowbrow But yeah, it's kind of lowbrow boardwalk.

30
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:51,134
Speaker 0: and also on a completely unrelated note My wonderful girlfriend Emily has informed me a little while ago that she arm wrestled a sumo wrestler in Japan and Beat him.

31
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:55,650
Speaker 0: now, there are more pertinent details of that story that might make it sound more feasible.

32
00:02:56,132 --> 00:03:00,609
Speaker 0: But the story as I have stated it is technically 100% true and I'm sticking to it.

33
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:12,490
Speaker 0: But anyway, I'm sure you all remember when Scott was stuck doing the show by himself and it came to critical acclaim Mostly critical especially in the forums and part of that was due to the fact that he didn't know how to use all of the equipment.

34
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,729
Speaker 0: So we ended up just using his computer in his room, but being me.

35
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:18,496
Speaker 0: I'm in my room with all the equipment We normally do the show on.

36
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:20,990
Speaker 0: all I did was turn off his mic and it's funny.

37
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,470
Speaker 0: But while it's more difficult to do the show, I don't have anyone to play off of.

38
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:35,250
Speaker 0: I don't have anyone to point the conversation or help me keep us on some sort of track and also, you know Reading body language while you're talking to someone really makes it easier to speak.

39
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:39,770
Speaker 0: I have absolutely no feedback and anything here except for all the little blinking lights and LEDs.

40
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:44,470
Speaker 0: But I don't have to deal with him breathing puck coughing and popping into the microphone.

41
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,726
Speaker 0: So editing is going to be a piece of cake this time around and thus without further ado.

42
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:49,709
Speaker 0: I do have some news.

43
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:55,730
Speaker 0: Ted Stevens the Republican senator from Alaska has voted against net neutrality.

44
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,582
Speaker 0: now We've talked about net neutrality many times.

45
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:17,829
Speaker 0: I don't really think I need to go over it in detail But very briefly it is the idea that internet service providers like Comcast have the right to charge entities like Google or Yahoo or Microsoft or YouTube Or the privilege of allowing their content to get to Comcast subscribers.

46
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:32,969
Speaker 0: They want to leverage the fact that we have X million subscribers so Google you have to pay us for access to these people and it is just this terrible idea and No one I mean no one who knows anything about technology is for it.

47
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:44,790
Speaker 0: the only people who are for this in any way shape or form are the people in charge of the ISPs who stand to make a lot of money and the Congressman that they have bribed and I say the word bribe because it's straight-up bribery.

48
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:52,857
Speaker 0: They've given substantial sums to a number of members of the House and Senate and all of these people have come out overwhelmingly against network neutrality.

49
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:55,987
Speaker 0: now one person in particular in particular Ted Stevens.

50
00:04:56,508 --> 00:05:03,890
Speaker 0: he Made an analogy as he tried to explain why he voted against it and I could paraphrase.

51
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:08,890
Speaker 0: I was going to just read what he said to all of you because the actual words he said were bad enough.

52
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:15,165
Speaker 0: Then I found some audio of him actually speaking and it's a thousand times worse.

53
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:20,902
Speaker 0: So let's roll some of that footage here And I do not believe that net neutrality is.

54
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:25,075
Speaker 0: this is something that Well, I would say this.

55
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:32,919
Speaker 2: I don't think anyone here has to find what net neutrality is and We've heard that we're slipping behind.

56
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:50,349
Speaker 2: this bill is designed to let us go ahead To expand the whole concept of communication And here we have this one situation where an enormous entities Want to use the internet for their purpose to save money for doing what they're doing now.

57
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:53,864
Speaker 2: They use FedEx they use that delivery services.

58
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,170
Speaker 2: They use the mail.

59
00:05:55,591 --> 00:06:01,730
Speaker 2: They they deliver in other ways, but they want to deliver vast amounts of information over the internet.

60
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:06,302
Speaker 2: And again, the internet is not something that you just dump something on.

61
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:07,285
Speaker 2: it's not a big truck.

62
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:13,019
Speaker 2: It's a series of tubes And if you don't understand those tubes can be filled.

63
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,310
Speaker 2: and if they're filled when you put your message in it gets in line.

64
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:22,758
Speaker 2: It's going to be delayed by anyone that puts into that tube an enormous amounts of material Enormous amounts of material now.

65
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,610
Speaker 2: We have a separate Department of Defense.

66
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:27,301
Speaker 2: You know that.

67
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:27,808
Speaker 2: you know why?

68
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,361
Speaker 2: Because they have to have theirs delivered immediately.

69
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,190
Speaker 2: they can't afford getting delayed by other people.

70
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:37,050
Speaker 2: The security United States requires a separate net for defense.

71
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:46,768
Speaker 2: Now, I think these people are arguing whether they should be able to dump all that stuff on the internet ought to consider whether they Ought to build a system themselves.

72
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:54,230
Speaker 2: Maybe there is a place for a commercial net but it's not using what the consumers use every day.

73
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:58,322
Speaker 2: It's not using the messaging service that is essential.

74
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:05,212
Speaker 2: I think that this this small business It's essential to our operation of Families.

75
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:06,235
Speaker 0: the whole now.

76
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:16,550
Speaker 0: obviously that is just an excerpt and he did speak for about 10 minutes in total And one I don't begrudge his speech impediment because he is an 83 year old man.

77
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:20,369
Speaker 0: What bothers me is that he has no idea what he's talking about?

78
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,901
Speaker 0: Which I mean wouldn't be a big deal in and of itself.

79
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,970
Speaker 0: people are allowed to not know about things.

80
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,429
Speaker 0: They just have to deal with the consequences.

81
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:37,042
Speaker 0: I mean if you have a VCR and you don't know how to program the time you can't use the time shifting features of the VCR but that doesn't affect anyone else who does know how to use that technology.

82
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:46,586
Speaker 0: when a member of the Senate who is voting on and deciding Policy about technology doesn't know anything about the technology.

83
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:47,469
Speaker 0: He's legislating.

84
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:50,762
Speaker 0: I just find this to be a travesty and I'm really.

85
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,490
Speaker 0: I have almost no recourse.

86
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,097
Speaker 0: I mean, this is a senator from Alaska.

87
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:03,401
Speaker 0: from what I can gather from some cursory research I did he is one of the big old boy Badasses of the Senate and almost anything he wants he gets.

88
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:16,865
Speaker 0: but he comes out very strongly against network neutrality and yet he doesn't seem to even understand what an email is or What the internet is or how it works or why his analogy is almost entirely broken.

89
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:28,610
Speaker 0: and even if it even if you follow his analogy and Even if it were right, it's still wrong because the underlying technological problems that the analogy brings light brings to light are completely fabricated.

90
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:31,730
Speaker 0: There is absolutely no shortage of bandwidth in the world.

91
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:38,448
Speaker 0: The only people who say there is are the people who have a vested interest in making bandwidth a limited commodities that they can sell It for higher prices.

92
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:46,520
Speaker 0: Well, we all know what that music means.

93
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:50,880
Speaker 0: It means rim wanted to cop out and not talk too long about any given news.

94
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,097
Speaker 0: So that again the show early and go to bed thus with things of the day.

95
00:08:54,117 --> 00:09:03,499
Speaker 0: now I was poking around on Google video looking for something weird and I found a really cute video of a kitten Falling to sleep and it was just one of the most adorable things I've ever seen.

96
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:06,912
Speaker 0: There was going to be my thing of the day until I discovered this.

97
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:08,899
Speaker 0: someone has made a video.

98
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:16,126
Speaker 0: It is basically 4chan the movie and the best way I can describe this is if Well many times in the past.

99
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:18,153
Speaker 0: We've tried to explain what 4chan is.

100
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:20,220
Speaker 0: 4chan is a site on the internet.

101
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:24,375
Speaker 0: I would consider it a couple steps below FARC.

102
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:31,339
Speaker 0: in terms of Mainstream ness it is definitely a little bit above the style project because there are non horrible things on it.

103
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:40,867
Speaker 0: If you watch this video all the way through I think you will have as good of an understanding of what 4chan is as Any human being could possibly have.

104
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:43,174
Speaker 0: it's definitely worth a watch though.

105
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:45,080
Speaker 0: I'll tell you now that it is not good.

106
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:46,379
Speaker 0: It is just informative.

107
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:54,420
Speaker 0: Now while I was driving back from the beach I thought long and hard about what I was going to do today's Scottless show on and I thought I had a brilliant idea.

108
00:09:55,042 --> 00:10:12,079
Speaker 0: I was going to talk about philosophy and in very very detailed terms now my personal philosophy my feelings very specifically on solipsism and Basically all the things that I can't talk about easily on the show with Scott mostly because he disagrees Exactly 100%.

109
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:12,341
Speaker 0: for me.

110
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:24,950
Speaker 0: I mean you see you've listened to the show and we seem to agree on Most issues of technology and science and all that but when it comes to philosophy We are exactly diametrically opposed in every possible way.

111
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:29,187
Speaker 0: So I thought that would have been an interesting show, but then I realized that it's late.

112
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:32,220
Speaker 0: I'm lazy I'm also somewhat tired and my foot hurts.

113
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:36,689
Speaker 0: You can't really argue about philosophy Especially when you're alone when your foot hurts.

114
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:38,497
Speaker 0: so instead I'm gonna cop out.

115
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:55,290
Speaker 0: and actually I have another relevant topic that I thought of just now as I Was poking around on our side and looking at the people who've linked to geek nights in the past few days Podcasting in terms of PR and promotions, you know promos getting your podcast out there all that sort of thing now.

116
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:06,970
Speaker 0: This is especially relevant because for any of you who read the forums any regular basis or subscribe to the non Podcast feeds like the blog feed you can see that we've finally after how many months made promos.

117
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:12,849
Speaker 0: we actually recorded them almost two weeks ago, and I never had a chance to get around actually editing them together.

118
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:18,565
Speaker 0: and Today since I was home alone and I had nothing better to do I put together all of our podcast or all of our promos.

119
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:23,474
Speaker 0: now We had a bunch of funny ideas and we made a whole bunch of different Remixes.

120
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:24,559
Speaker 0: now you can just go and listen to.

121
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,876
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna play them on the air or anything like that But I will say we have the basic promo.

122
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:31,604
Speaker 0: the basic promo blues brothers edition.

123
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:35,234
Speaker 0: the basic promo Spanish Inquisition edition.

124
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:56,090
Speaker 0: the basic promo blues brothers Spanish Inquisition mega mix and a completely unrelated promo where we talk about how doing promo sucks and I gotta say I mean geek nights has grown very large and we if you look at we have a graph that we've been generating over time of The average number of listeners based on the hits we get to the feed from unique IP addresses and all that.

125
00:11:56,432 --> 00:12:07,190
Speaker 0: it's something that lips it or feed burner does for us and The growth rate has gone from being a linear relationship to an exponential one recently and we have a huge influx of new listeners.

126
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:10,764
Speaker 0: Despite this I mean it's even now we haven't really advertised much.

127
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:12,250
Speaker 0: We've put some flyers at some cons.

128
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:15,090
Speaker 0: We've started appearing on other podcasts.

129
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:25,579
Speaker 0: This is a very recent phenomenon and may world order in their upcoming episode or maybe the one after that is going to have a long Segment that Scott and I recorded and then they're going to argue with us.

130
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:35,388
Speaker 0: and also we appeared recently on geek speak Which is a fun awesome podcast and he pseudo interviewed us and basically Scott and I are on his entire show.

131
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,110
Speaker 0: It's really fun.

132
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,239
Speaker 0: I'm gonna link to it in the show notes.

133
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:47,289
Speaker 0: Definitely worth a listen Especially if you want to hear a whole bunch more about what we have to say about Anime cons and anime conventions and also his podcast is worth listening to even if we're not on it.

134
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,822
Speaker 0: But now we're going all out on the advertising.

135
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,370
Speaker 0: I mean we've got these promos.

136
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,440
Speaker 0: We're starting to get other people to play the promos.

137
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:59,750
Speaker 0: You may start hearing other promos from the podcast We listen to being played on geek nights.

138
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,469
Speaker 0: We're not sure exactly where we're going to fit that into the whole lineup of bits on the show.

139
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:09,646
Speaker 0: But I got to say recording a promo was a thousand times harder than anything.

140
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:17,249
Speaker 0: I've done for geek nights And in fact everything I've done for geek nights combined was easier than trying to record a promo because doing the show is easy.

141
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:21,370
Speaker 0: We just sit down and we do what we would have done even if there weren't any microphones here.

142
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:38,167
Speaker 0: I mean after the first 20 or 30 episodes We got it down to an art and we can just sit down Crank out an episode and then it takes me about two or three minutes worth of editing and post-production to throw it up Not counting up and code times obviously because my computer is very slow.

143
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:44,922
Speaker 0: the actual time I spend editing the podcast and Actually doing things to it as opposed to waiting for my computer to finish doing.

144
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:52,490
Speaker 0: it is less than five minutes at Absolute most unless we do a crazy episode with a whole bunch of whole bunch of audio feedback or anything funny like that.

145
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,978
Speaker 0: But the promo was different because we tried to.

146
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,250
Speaker 0: actually I think our best promo was the one where we didn't actually do anything.

147
00:13:58,592 --> 00:14:05,130
Speaker 0: We just started recording and started complaining about promos And then I just cut out a section in the middle there and made it a promo.

148
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,846
Speaker 0: But as for the rest of them, we actually wrote them up script them out practice them a bunch of times.

149
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:20,070
Speaker 0: at some point I'm going to compile all of the takes we did and Put them in the forums for all of you who want to see the creative process of rim and Scott on geek nights.

150
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:40,759
Speaker 0: Now some people have suggested that we do that for shows as well And I'd love to do it except that we very often do very little in terms of pre-production and most of the recording would literally be silence followed by Scott saying I'm doing this news and then a five minutes later me saying Well, I'm doing this news.

151
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,204
Speaker 0: I don't have a thing of the day.

152
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:43,228
Speaker 0: Oh, here's one.

153
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:49,618
Speaker 0: Never mind like we don't other than picking what news we want to do and Picking what things the day we want.

154
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:52,330
Speaker 0: we do absolutely no planning anymore for the show.

155
00:14:52,430 --> 00:15:03,730
Speaker 0: it's just live off the cuff, but we actually sat down and we wrote up the promo and we practiced it and we did it and It took like 10 takes to get it down and even then I think that it sounds kind of cheesy.

156
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:08,090
Speaker 0: Actually, the only part I like is the Spanish Inquisition part and the Blues Brothers part.

157
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:15,130
Speaker 0: I think those parts are good, but all the parts where we're actually just talking about our show I feel a little skeevy like a shill.

158
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:22,150
Speaker 0: I'm very used to I guess selling myself or promoting myself on an individual basis, you know applying for a job.

159
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,370
Speaker 0: I'm trying to sell myself to the company or going to a new convention.

160
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,490
Speaker 0: I'm trying to sell myself to the staffers as hey, I'm the kind of person you want on your staff.

161
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:35,474
Speaker 0: I'm the kind of person you want to be a guest or a panelist or in my professional life as selling myself as I'm the Person you want to come to.

162
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:38,850
Speaker 0: I'm the expert you want to give money to in order to get services.

163
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:45,990
Speaker 0: And if I could just walk around and sell geek nights on a one-to-one basis to every person in the world.

164
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:53,430
Speaker 0: I think I could do it pretty easily, but well not not in terms of getting them on listen But in terms of me doing it, I know what I'd say.

165
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,756
Speaker 0: I know how I'd approach people.

166
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:01,889
Speaker 0: when it comes to making a mass market advertisement like a podcast promo It's a whole different ballgame.

167
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:16,190
Speaker 0: The one thing that really got to me was that I at first we were trying to make an actual generic Promo like the kind of thing that would be a radio spot And I realized that this doesn't work so well in podcasting because it's a very inward-looking community.

168
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:20,510
Speaker 0: Podcasting isn't growing very quickly among people who don't already listen to podcasts.

169
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:27,370
Speaker 0: So when we make promos now But by and large the only people are going to play them are other podcasts with overlapping interests.

170
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:35,452
Speaker 0: So as a result the best we can do is poach listeners from other podcasts or get people to listen to more Podcasts.

171
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:39,710
Speaker 0: none of these promos are going to get people who don't listen to podcasts to listen to podcasts now.

172
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,976
Speaker 0: We've got a whole strategy on a way to get a whole bunch of new people into podcasting and that's going to involve.

173
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:55,550
Speaker 0: our show at Otacon will actually probably be talking to a lot of the Podcasters we know who will be attending Otacon to set up some sort of press packet or something.

174
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:06,930
Speaker 0: We're going to make sure that all the podcasts that are worth listening to that are present at Otacon are Well not on the panel, I mean no no not to be evil, but it's our panel and we're running it.

175
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,175
Speaker 0: But we're gonna make sure.

176
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:16,150
Speaker 0: we want to get the word out to all of these people at Otacon that they're anime Podcasts and there are geek podcasts and that by and large many of them are awesome.

177
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:19,829
Speaker 0: Not as awesome as geek nights possibly, but very awesome nonetheless.

178
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:32,647
Speaker 0: but the whole idea of promoting podcasts to non podcast listeners is something that I realized outside of events like that or Paying for press outside of the podcasting world.

179
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:34,380
Speaker 0: the podosphere I don't know.

180
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,390
Speaker 0: There's no word for it yet And anyone who actually says podosphere in a non-ironic way deserves to be shot.

181
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:42,570
Speaker 0: It's really a topic that I just can't bother with.

182
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:44,610
Speaker 0: I have no way to do it short of spending a bunch of money.

183
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:51,490
Speaker 0: So we copped out and we made our promos very much aiming toward people who already listen to podcasts.

184
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:52,609
Speaker 0: We're already geeks.

185
00:17:52,891 --> 00:18:02,048
Speaker 0: We don't explain how RSS feeds work or how to get to our podcast other than you know URL and maybe a word about iTunes or a podcast directory.

186
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,830
Speaker 0: now Of course, I would love to get some feedback from all of you out there as to what are how good the promos are.

187
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,454
Speaker 0: Do you like them?

188
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:10,118
Speaker 0: are they?

189
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:11,325
Speaker 0: are they painful to listen to?

190
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:12,070
Speaker 0: are they too corny?

191
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:12,655
Speaker 0: Do they work?

192
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:13,604
Speaker 0: which ones are good?

193
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:14,250
Speaker 0: which ones are bad?

194
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,374
Speaker 0: I mean, we really don't know.

195
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:25,399
Speaker 0: I listen to all of them and I really I can't judge them objectively and I can't really judge them too subjectively either because I Have the bias one.

196
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:36,090
Speaker 0: I have the bias of anything I do is awesome But I also have the self-critical bias of everything I do sucks Which is great when I'm trying to write a paper and I go over it a thousand times, but I digress.

197
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:37,681
Speaker 0: Let me know what you think.

198
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:38,769
Speaker 0: are these promos good?

199
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,062
Speaker 0: would you play them?

200
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:51,170
Speaker 0: and we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with playing promos on our own show because I've noticed that most of the Podcast promo people out there who set up, you know promo exchanges.

201
00:18:51,530 --> 00:19:01,469
Speaker 0: there's very much this idea that if you play a promo for someone it's understood that they will then play a promo for you and I don't like the idea of that.

202
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:10,509
Speaker 0: I would honestly only ever play a promo of podcast that I or Scott listened to or at least if we didn't listen to it If we would vouch for it being good.

203
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:20,228
Speaker 0: I really wouldn't feel comfortable playing a promo or in any way promoting something Just because that group or that person felt fit to promote me.

204
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:31,330
Speaker 0: now I'm wondering if as time goes on and we may be paying far fewer promos than people are playing of ours if there will be any negative Consequences of that or if anyone's going to get angry with us.

205
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,630
Speaker 0: But I don't really care other than an idle curiosity.

206
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:42,544
Speaker 0: honestly now of course would have been wonderful if we had somehow gotten a a writer or Someone who could just write ad copy for us to read.

207
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:43,670
Speaker 0: I mean that would have been fantastic.

208
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:47,367
Speaker 0: We're not very good at writing ad copy our.

209
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:57,988
Speaker 0: I mean You should see the extensive notes we took and all the trial and error we tried to come up with even a rudimentary promo and we actually recorded it once and it was just terrible.

210
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:03,830
Speaker 0: and I still have That original recording of our first attempt at a promo which may or may not see the light of day.

211
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:10,610
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll make some sort of special geek nights outtake CD or episode someday in the future when we're really hurting for content.

212
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:14,199
Speaker 0: Now, of course another fun promotional activity.

213
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:26,729
Speaker 0: We're going to try to be doing soon will involve swag and merchandise since whenever classic bribe finishes all of the you know, finishing design work from his Site design and the logo contest and all that.

214
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:38,050
Speaker 0: we're going to start in short order making a pile of various t-shirts and posters and all that fun stuff and I have a feeling that we're going to give a lot of it away for free and in the very least we've said this before.

215
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:45,950
Speaker 0: But I can't stress enough that we're not going to sell any swag We make at least any time in the next several years at any sort of profit.

216
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:56,067
Speaker 0: Because the idea of someone wearing a shirt that has something on it That was something I did is so awesome to me that I don't need to make money off of the idea.

217
00:20:56,107 --> 00:21:01,610
Speaker 0: seeing someone wearing a geek Night shirt would be just amazing enough on its own and like on Penn Penn Gillette.

218
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:09,427
Speaker 0: So show where he's talking about how he's got his new phone number for the podcast or the radio show and it spells out Penn And he's won't shut up about that.

219
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:17,129
Speaker 0: but anyway I'll cut this episode short mostly because I'm just kind of lazy and I want to go play some DS games and Hit them and go to bed.

220
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:21,282
Speaker 0: Also the fact that it's a billion degrees here and my air conditioner still can't keep up.

221
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:34,686
Speaker 0: if you hear any odd noise in the background That's because usually we I make the room really cold before we do a show and then we turn the air conditioner off and I open All of the doors in the back of my room to prevent the echoes from coming into the microphones.

222
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:39,230
Speaker 0: and today I wasn't gonna bother with that because then my room would have become an inferno in short order.

223
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:42,890
Speaker 0: Thus the air conditioners on full blast in the background the fans going in the background.

224
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,842
Speaker 0: Everything's were in a buzzin, but be sure to check us out on geek speak.

225
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:51,193
Speaker 0: Be sure to check us out on anime world order At some point.

226
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:59,766
Speaker 0: I'm going to appear on Friday night party line since Scott did at one point and while I've really wanted to be on the show and they've asked me to be on the show.

227
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,918
Speaker 0: I Haven't had time.

228
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,395
Speaker 0: I haven't been home and free Until just now.

229
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:10,266
Speaker 0: tomorrow is gonna be my first free day in a long long time And I'm still not quite sure what I'm going to do with it.

230
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:18,330
Speaker 0: I'd originally planned to climb the mountain or go on a crazy hike or something But all that DDR on the boardwalk kind of killed those aspirations.

231
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:24,120
Speaker 0: I I've either torn or pulled a tendon or something on my left foot and it's really smart right now.

232
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:30,570
Speaker 0: So be sure to join us tomorrow when we resume our normal broadcast schedule with Tuesday gaming day.

233
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:36,469
Speaker 0: I imagine we're gonna talk a lot about DDR and Dance Dance Revolution on the boardwalk and at home and all that sort of thing.

234
00:22:37,052 --> 00:22:40,162
Speaker 0: Also some house of the dead for some time crisis for.

235
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:51,750
Speaker 0: and of course one final note I would love it if there was some feedback into the forums as to which show was better the Scott show or the rim show.

236
00:22:54,313 --> 00:23:04,170
Speaker 0: Because I got to say I know I've said this a bunch of times already But it really is odd to have just me talking into a microphone like this And I don't know if I'll ever get used to it.

237
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:19,850
Speaker 0: I mean I could read copy I could read a book or I could do something like that But speaking extemporaneously to no audience yet at the same time as being recorded is just something that I don't know If I could ever get used to doing on any regular basis.

238
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:37,251
Speaker 0: It's very difficult to keep myself on topic or more importantly it's very difficult to resist the urge to just edit out any stumbling I make or Like say every bit every paragraph every sentence three or four times pick the best one and then hobble together over the course of several Hours.

239
00:23:37,552 --> 00:23:39,097
Speaker 0: an absolutely amazing podcast.

240
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:45,874
Speaker 0: luckily laziness very much Trump's will and thus I will see you or at least you'll hear me tomorrow.

241
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:55,950
Speaker 0: and that was geek nights with rim and Scott special.
