1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,647
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, May 8th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:12,991
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:13,813
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,357
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:16,822
Speaker 1: What time is it?

6
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:19,631
Speaker 1: I guess Scott doesn't want to play along.

7
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:21,097
Speaker 1: It's adventure time.

8
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:22,702
Speaker 0: It could be many other times.

9
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:23,905
Speaker 0: Text time.

10
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:25,689
Speaker 1: Right now, adventure time.

11
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:26,351
Speaker 0: Game time.

12
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,195
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

13
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:36,949
Speaker 1: So Scott really hasn't watched it or isn't really a fan of it, but I'm really big into adventure brothers and season 5 is coming up way soon.

14
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:39,619
Speaker 0: I don't understand seasons anymore.

15
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:41,083
Speaker 0: It's like all the TV seasons.

16
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:43,329
Speaker 1: Because that's how production schedules work.

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,722
Speaker 0: There used to be that TV seasons started a certain time and ended and all the seasons started and ended at the same time of every show.

18
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:58,426
Speaker 0: And then there would be a time where there was just 100% reruns for months and then all new TV shows.

19
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:05,415
Speaker 1: So Scott, one, the reason you perceive that is that there was a time in your life when you paid attention to that and watched TV.

20
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:07,624
Speaker 1: And nowadays, you don't pay attention anymore.

21
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:10,233
Speaker 0: TV shows start all different times.

22
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:13,525
Speaker 1: Part of that too is that TV has changed.

23
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:14,770
Speaker 1: Cable has changed.

24
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,119
Speaker 1: I mean, when we were kids, there really wasn't cable.

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,281
Speaker 1: I know.

26
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,267
Speaker 1: But cable came out.

27
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:20,455
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's good or bad.

28
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,025
Speaker 0: I'm just saying there's been a change here.

29
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:24,197
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's been a lot of changes.

30
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:32,377
Speaker 1: These changes have been going on for a long time and I think part of it is just that you don't watch normal TV anymore because normal TV follows the more standard schedules.

31
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:36,493
Speaker 1: People still talk about summer reruns if they watch network bullshit sitcoms.

32
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,240
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter though.

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,123
Speaker 1: It's all internet now.

34
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:49,957
Speaker 1: But yeah, Venture Brothers season five took for fucking... I can't believe how old Venture Brothers is until I looked at when season one came out.

35
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:54,473
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I remember, I think the first Kineticon we went to...

36
00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:55,999
Speaker 1: You sure it wasn't Anime Boston?

37
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:07,378
Speaker 0: We went into this little tiny room where we got our folders with our itineraries and they had a tiny TV in that conference room and Venture Brothers is on that TV.

38
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,627
Speaker 1: I remember that happening at an Anime Boston.

39
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:10,770
Speaker 0: It was not Anime Boston.

40
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:21,600
Speaker 1: There was a PAX where we were going to perform in a room and it was at night and they were just showing clips from Venture Brothers in the room to the audience before we showed up, just like hanging out.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,082
Speaker 0: That's true.

42
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:26,457
Speaker 1: So the thing is, it's funny because it's a show that I remember.

43
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:31,440
Speaker 1: I watched a few episodes because I was in India just waiting for a flight and I had it on my laptop.

44
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,660
Speaker 1: So I watched like the first four episodes and much like ponies, I was like, you know what?

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,723
Speaker 1: It's an okay show.

46
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:38,670
Speaker 1: Not great, but it's okay.

47
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:40,517
Speaker 1: But I get a long flight.

48
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:43,631
Speaker 1: so I watched the entire first season and the show just got better and better and better and better.

49
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:56,064
Speaker 1: I got Emily to start watching the show by skipping a lot of that first season stuff and just starting with the really good stuff and then backpedaling and seeing the original episodes once she kind of had seen stuff.

50
00:02:56,766 --> 00:03:02,468
Speaker 1: So she's pretty much caught up now and I'll be able to watch the new season going forward with someone instead of by myself.

51
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,114
Speaker 1: Goddamn, I love that show.

52
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:06,624
Speaker 1: You'll get into it.

53
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:09,156
Speaker 1: I mean, you've resisted Adventure Time for the longest time.

54
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:10,422
Speaker 0: I didn't resist it.

55
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:14,072
Speaker 0: You seem to think I resist things because I delay.

56
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,138
Speaker 0: There was a delay in resisting, right?

57
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,987
Speaker 0: So adventure adventure time.

58
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:29,364
Speaker 0: I was delaying venture brothers resisting because I've seen it and it's not the kind of, it's, it's like one of those shows like Archer or C lab where I don't think it's funny.

59
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:33,903
Speaker 1: I still don't understand how you don't find Archer funny considering the other things you find funny.

60
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:37,795
Speaker 0: It's just sort of ridiculous and not humorous.

61
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:43,455
Speaker 1: So adventure time is clearly a no way ridiculous adventure time.

62
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:46,327
Speaker 0: Well, why don't we wait to the second half of the show for me to discuss that?

63
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:48,296
Speaker 1: So there was a Twitter discussion.

64
00:03:48,778 --> 00:04:05,693
Speaker 1: Mike tool was involved and I threw my sense in and it came down to the fact that apparently episode 11 kids on the slope with its Bure release was either missing the left audio channel on the Japanese track or there was some other problem with it.

65
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,443
Speaker 0: And I'm sure it was actually missing the left.

66
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,629
Speaker 0: or was it the balance all to the right?

67
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:18,575
Speaker 0: It's either not there or on some there's like 100% of the track is mixed to the right side of mono.

68
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:19,920
Speaker 1: So it was missing.

69
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:23,655
Speaker 1: or it was so low volume, but it wasn't in the right track, which is gone.

70
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:46,522
Speaker 1: But there's more to it than that because when I was trying to find a succinct explanation of the problem just now to be able to talk about it, I discovered that anime DVD, well, anime DVD, anime boo rays have a history of fucked up audio and video issues and sampling issues and all these people complaining.

71
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:57,815
Speaker 1: But the people complaining usually don't know enough about audio or surround sound or Dolby or Bure to succinctly describe what their problems are.

72
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:00,906
Speaker 1: And many people don't believe those problems exist.

73
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:10,810
Speaker 1: But then I find people who find problems that are clearly real, but then there are fanboys who don't believe the problems exist because they're surround sound set up wrong in the first place.

74
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:14,667
Speaker 1: So I've been watching this whole thing and I think I have a more meta point to make.

75
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,480
Speaker 1: Physical media is dead except to collectors.

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,109
Speaker 0: Physical media has been head for a long time.

77
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:24,708
Speaker 0: I don't understand how blue Ray is still alive or why anyone ever buys them ever.

78
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:26,496
Speaker 0: It makes no sense to me.

79
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:27,761
Speaker 1: I could say, well, here's the thing.

80
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,349
Speaker 1: I would buy physical media for a show.

81
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:35,405
Speaker 1: that one, I don't have a reliably existent forever stream of two.

82
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:41,302
Speaker 1: I regularly show to other people in my house, you know, a physical media is.

83
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:43,571
Speaker 0: I get a digital copy onto a hard drive.

84
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:48,508
Speaker 0: Now it's a physical media that, uh, yeah, well, lately I'm really rip.

85
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:53,165
Speaker 1: I basically only watch streaming stuff now and things I actually care about.

86
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:57,304
Speaker 1: I will rip and I'm kind of planning to rip every DVD I own and they get rid of them all.

87
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,330
Speaker 0: I already did a lot of that.

88
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:00,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, already did a lot of that.

89
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:06,547
Speaker 1: In fact, I'm in the process of ripping all of utenna as we ramp up production of geek nights presents already did that.

90
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:11,447
Speaker 1: Uh, the trouble is depending on ripping formats and everything, sometimes subtitles, there's.

91
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,382
Speaker 1: every like old anime release has its own particular bullshit.

92
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:16,367
Speaker 0: You got to know what you're doing.

93
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,211
Speaker 1: Yeah.

94
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:24,000
Speaker 1: Well, you got to put some manual effort into figuring out the particular problems with each individual anime series and publisher.

95
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:32,754
Speaker 0: But the point is, is that, you know, regardless of the problems of physical media in general, particularly right, the less professional releases, right.

96
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:36,769
Speaker 0: And anime companies are less big time than, say, Hollywood movies.

97
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:37,231
Speaker 0: Good God.

98
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,958
Speaker 1: It is clearly amateur hour.

99
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,413
Speaker 0: It's amateur hour when it comes to mastering their DVDs and buries.

100
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:50,081
Speaker 0: And it always has been, except there are a few right companies that even though they are amateur, it's not amateur hour.

101
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:54,895
Speaker 0: For example, say anime ego back in the day or disco tech now.

102
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:55,517
Speaker 0: Right.

103
00:06:55,718 --> 00:07:04,737
Speaker 0: They put in they're the people who actually care about the stuff they're doing and they're putting in the full effort, but say a fundamentally or a band is just like whatever.

104
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:12,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I'd, but what's funny is I was reading all these Twitter conversations and forum conversations about this and I noticed something kind of an anecdote.

105
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:19,162
Speaker 1: There were three classes of people, the people who weren't involved because they just stream everything and don't care about physical media.

106
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:28,512
Speaker 1: People like me who are busybodies and complain and the people who were defending the anime companies who make mistakes because you got to support them.

107
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:32,104
Speaker 0: See previous geek nights episode.

108
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:33,469
Speaker 0: This is not a charity.

109
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:41,001
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is there is a way to make it a charity by using a combination of Kickstarter and donations and whatever, but that's a whole separate thing.

110
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:44,713
Speaker 1: My anecdotal evidence is something much more subtle.

111
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:54,952
Speaker 1: The people who were saying these mistakes are common in other industries and we shouldn't hold the anime industry to that high of standard because they're so small and whatever.

112
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:59,732
Speaker 1: We're almost universally very poorly spelled and with bad grammar.

113
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:00,194
Speaker 1: Okay.

114
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:09,865
Speaker 1: And the people who are saying things like the release is ruined or this is bullshit amateur hour use proper punctuation and good word order and spelling.

115
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:13,760
Speaker 0: So just, just pointing that out in a somewhat related news, right?

116
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,937
Speaker 0: No Zomi, another anime company is releasing princess night on DVD in the U S.

117
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:21,820
Speaker 1: oh shit son.

118
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:30,937
Speaker 0: And they're doing some crazy remaster and you can see this link that is provided for you a video comparison showing you the kind of remaster they're doing.

119
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,523
Speaker 1: Wait, is this a good remaster?

120
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,448
Speaker 1: or is this the Utena one, which is good.

121
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,937
Speaker 1: This is like.

122
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:41,894
Speaker 0: this is like the anime ego Macross one where it's just all the color is correct, right?

123
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:43,620
Speaker 0: However, there is a flaw.

124
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,605
Speaker 1: The flaw is a fatal.

125
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:46,187
Speaker 0: No.

126
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:46,648
Speaker 0: Okay.

127
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:53,872
Speaker 0: Well kind of because it does it clearly given clue the final episode because of the materials that they have to work with.

128
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,585
Speaker 0: They do not have Japanese audio that they can include.

129
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,789
Speaker 0: So it is dove only.

130
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,283
Speaker 1: Ah, but that modern Astro boy had the same problems.

131
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:04,773
Speaker 1: The reason I didn't watch it because that was the worst.

132
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:08,547
Speaker 0: So this, they, to their credit though, right?

133
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:11,478
Speaker 0: The top comment on YouTube is I would get this.

134
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:21,014
Speaker 0: If only there was an option for the original Japanese audio with English subtitles, they themselves officially replied with their account saying, sorry, frowny face.

135
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:23,607
Speaker 0: We've been pretty open about the reasons we can't include.

136
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,206
Speaker 0: the Japanese audio is just not possible with the source materials provided to us.

137
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:31,487
Speaker 0: We still think this will be a very impressive addition for all the PK fans out there.

138
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:32,432
Speaker 0: Smiley face.

139
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:34,061
Speaker 1: So is it because I haven't followed this news at all.

140
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:37,697
Speaker 1: Is it that the Japanese company won't give it to them or that it's gone?

141
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:40,528
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that it's just, it sounds right.

142
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,458
Speaker 1: My gone can happen and that sucks.

143
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,612
Speaker 1: There are gone situations in the world, but I doubt this is a gone.

144
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:56,518
Speaker 0: My interpretation is that given whatever audio masters they have received, the quality or completeness of those is lacking.

145
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:07,824
Speaker 0: Like the, you know, there might be like just completely missing or, or the sound is like you can't hear it or full of noise, like, you know, something like that, that kind of issue, right?

146
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:11,499
Speaker 0: It doesn't seem like it's an issue where the material doesn't exist.

147
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:16,758
Speaker 0: It's an issue where the material that they received from saying they received.

148
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,775
Speaker 1: That's why I'm wondering what the Japanese company has to say about this.

149
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:24,490
Speaker 1: They, they, who knows what they might have like something better or they might not.

150
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:34,765
Speaker 1: And I say, or they might've let it fall because I don't know who owns whatever rights and I don't know, but do they, do they have the masters?

151
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:36,533
Speaker 0: Maybe that is the master they had.

152
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:38,080
Speaker 0: Maybe it's, I don't know, but whatever.

153
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:38,983
Speaker 1: Yeah.

154
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:44,927
Speaker 1: This is a problem in general that we need to be better about archiving stuff that wasn't already digital before.

155
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:46,072
Speaker 1: it's too late and we lose it all.

156
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:50,269
Speaker 1: But I worry that this was not necessarily a situation of.

157
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:52,056
Speaker 1: it wasn't available, but a situation of.

158
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,153
Speaker 1: there was some BS with whatever company has rights and copyright disputes.

159
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:56,836
Speaker 0: Yeah.

160
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:03,361
Speaker 1: I think that, you know, that stuff seems to happen way more often currently than it literally does not actually exist anymore.

161
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:06,075
Speaker 0: It could also be that they got their source material.

162
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:08,085
Speaker 0: They couldn't get the source materials from Japan.

163
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:10,556
Speaker 0: They could only get them from the U S right.

164
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:11,300
Speaker 0: Something like that.

165
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,360
Speaker 1: But again, if it's something like that, that usually also means there's some IP dispute.

166
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,565
Speaker 0: Something like that.

167
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:16,866
Speaker 0: Yeah.

168
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,866
Speaker 1: I hate the fact that there's no way to get the fullness of what happens in these situations.

169
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:24,079
Speaker 0: It's it's like, why not tell everybody things?

170
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:24,440
Speaker 0: Whatever.

171
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,341
Speaker 0: I've discussed that before.

172
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:42,358
Speaker 1: We talked about that, but anyway, things of the day, way back we had this video, I forget if it was me or Scott, but it was a, uh, a cat singing about how he can't find his keys in the morning.

173
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:48,259
Speaker 1: Something that even now, not owning a car happens to me on a semi regular basis.

174
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:52,310
Speaker 1: Heavens to me, never, but a situation we've all used.

175
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,335
Speaker 1: You've never experienced that.

176
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:54,280
Speaker 1: You've never been out to go.

177
00:11:54,301 --> 00:12:00,146
Speaker 0: I have in the past, but I have a system that has been working for many years of perfectness.

178
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:02,014
Speaker 1: Well, my system now is I have a drawer.

179
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,138
Speaker 1: My keys always are.

180
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:03,559
Speaker 1: Okay.

181
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,483
Speaker 1: Got my wallet.

182
00:12:04,503 --> 00:12:09,481
Speaker 0: The problem will be I use the ropey thing inside of my Timbuktu bag and go click.

183
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,648
Speaker 1: I don't carry my bag anymore.

184
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:12,070
Speaker 1: Ever.

185
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,579
Speaker 0: I carry my bag, carry my bag bag is important.

186
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,673
Speaker 1: I don't carry my laptop with me cause I don't need it anymore.

187
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:18,859
Speaker 0: I carry a lot of stuff with me.

188
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,331
Speaker 1: I carry, I basically carry nothing with me.

189
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:21,814
Speaker 1: Yeah.

190
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:24,972
Speaker 0: What happens when you're outside and then that's the apocalypse and you don't have any equipment.

191
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:35,111
Speaker 1: I'll break into paragraph sports and get it all because I just got, when the apocalypse happens, your net runner cards and your laptop are not going to be that.

192
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:36,899
Speaker 0: And those are the most important things.

193
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,045
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

194
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:39,513
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was a funny video.

195
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:42,391
Speaker 0: We're going to pass the time in the fallout shelter without net runner cards.

196
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:52,904
Speaker 1: So, uh, the people behind that funny video did in fact continue to make funny videos and they have a youtube series that is basically just the odd couple.

197
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:59,626
Speaker 1: But if they're worse people, it's actually really funny and I've watched every episode of it.

198
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:00,570
Speaker 1: It is crude.

199
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:04,038
Speaker 1: It is mean black humor and it is great.

200
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,141
Speaker 0: All right.

201
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:06,705
Speaker 0: Is that it?

202
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:07,186
Speaker 0: That's it.

203
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:07,567
Speaker 0: Okay.

204
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:13,345
Speaker 0: So, uh, you know, on my wall, I have that awesome, uh, woodblock print.

205
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:14,167
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, you do.

206
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:16,956
Speaker 0: It depicts, uh, what's his face?

207
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:19,203
Speaker 1: Uh, you already forgot.

208
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:19,725
Speaker 0: I forgot.

209
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:23,699
Speaker 0: All I remember is that it's, it's, oh, it's, is it Yoshitsune I think.

210
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,421
Speaker 0: And the, and, uh, Bankade the warrior monk and they're both, and they just killed the whole Tyra clan.

211
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:31,049
Speaker 0: Like they're evil enemies, right?

212
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,234
Speaker 0: Well, they're enemies.

213
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,325
Speaker 0: They're like, it's like half fields and McCoys.

214
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,115
Speaker 0: The half fields just killed all the fucking McCoys.

215
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:38,749
Speaker 0: I don't even actually know what happened with that in reality.

216
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:41,144
Speaker 0: But anyway, and they get in a boat and they're going back home.

217
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:43,173
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think this is the woodblock you have, right?

218
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:44,898
Speaker 0: This one now, but that's right.

219
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:45,500
Speaker 0: Not it.

220
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:52,807
Speaker 0: And, uh, the, uh, all of the ghosts of all the dead Tyra clan people come up or all around the boat.

221
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:54,633
Speaker 0: Like, Ooh, you just killed us all.

222
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:57,100
Speaker 0: Ooh, assholes.

223
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,125
Speaker 0: We're going to, right.

224
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:04,359
Speaker 0: So anyway, uh, so here's a website I found ukiyo a.org.

225
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,966
Speaker 0: It is a Japanese woodblock print search.

226
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,919
Speaker 0: Oh, it has pretty much every woodblock print ever.

227
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,533
Speaker 0: As far as I can tell, I have not, there is none that I know of.

228
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:23,607
Speaker 0: And I know of quite a few that I was not able to find on this site, including the one I have my wall and it separates them too by like, you know, time.

229
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:30,350
Speaker 0: So it goes all the way from early to mid 17 hundreds all the way up to like 19 fifties to now.

230
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,372
Speaker 0: And they had some fricking modern ones on here that are really brightly colored because fucking modern.

231
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:35,476
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

232
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:36,901
Speaker 0: Look at this one with the mountain.

233
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:37,744
Speaker 1: Not bad.

234
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:38,467
Speaker 0: Okay.

235
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:42,804
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, we're going to be at anime Boston doing five events.

236
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:47,763
Speaker 1: We're also going to be a kinetic on packs, Australia packs, dev packs, prime magfest, et cetera.

237
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:48,325
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

238
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:54,187
Speaker 1: Uh, we got a forum book club book, player of games in a banks forum, YouTube, uh, Twitter.

239
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:58,539
Speaker 1: Grand Prix is currently Galaga Galaga.

240
00:14:58,659 --> 00:14:59,481
Speaker 0: Shoot them bugs.

241
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:05,037
Speaker 1: It's got, what if I do not not get points forever, but I just take my sweet time.

242
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:09,455
Speaker 0: Eventually, you know, you're, you're using my time cause I have to watch you play.

243
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,359
Speaker 0: It's a one chance.

244
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,781
Speaker 0: Yeah.

245
00:15:11,122 --> 00:15:14,818
Speaker 0: And if I have to, if you take up your whole, you know, whatever, whatever watch.

246
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:15,702
Speaker 1: So what's the rule?

247
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:18,131
Speaker 1: The rule is there a time limit?

248
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:18,413
Speaker 1: Yeah.

249
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:21,386
Speaker 0: When I have to fucking go because I have a higher priority.

250
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:24,921
Speaker 0: Like besides watching you fucking is, is completely invalid.

251
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:26,468
Speaker 1: Cause what if someone's on the Epic?

252
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:28,639
Speaker 1: Like they're just going and going and going, but you got to pay.

253
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:29,685
Speaker 1: What are you going to do?

254
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:33,683
Speaker 0: Listen, you schedule a time for this shit with me, right?

255
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:34,888
Speaker 0: You're going to have enough time.

256
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:36,859
Speaker 0: Most people are going to die within a few minutes.

257
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:39,271
Speaker 0: No one's going to play for hours and hours and hours.

258
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:39,953
Speaker 1: I don't know.

259
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:44,008
Speaker 0: And if they do, right, it's like they win.

260
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:45,173
Speaker 0: Who else is going to go that long?

261
00:15:45,313 --> 00:15:46,218
Speaker 0: Yeah.

262
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:51,663
Speaker 1: So what if three people were going to go, one guy is going to go hours and hours and hours and some guys going that you cut him off.

263
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,672
Speaker 0: If some guys go in that long, right?

264
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,053
Speaker 0: Yeah.

265
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:56,741
Speaker 0: We're talking world record situation.

266
00:15:57,403 --> 00:16:00,193
Speaker 0: So it becomes suddenly becomes bigger than the grand Prix.

267
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:02,482
Speaker 0: It becomes super important unless he's just really slow.

268
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:05,154
Speaker 0: You can't be slow at Galaga.

269
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:07,887
Speaker 1: He gets down to one bug each time and then takes a sweet ass time.

270
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:12,709
Speaker 1: Relaxing, recuperating, avoiding that one bug over and over again, does the no shootie glitch.

271
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:14,436
Speaker 0: It's not easy to avoid.

272
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:16,122
Speaker 1: the people do the no shootie glitch.

273
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:20,564
Speaker 0: We, we, uh, I was going to let people do no shootie because I was going to do the no shootie glitch.

274
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:22,656
Speaker 0: I'm assuming that no one can actually pull it off.

275
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:24,083
Speaker 1: I pulled it off like five times.

276
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:24,646
Speaker 1: I tried it.

277
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,951
Speaker 0: I'm going to go try it and see if I can do it and that will, then I will determine if I had to ban it or not.

278
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,496
Speaker 1: It's really easy to pull off.

279
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:32,201
Speaker 0: I'm going to try it anyway.

280
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:32,984
Speaker 1: Anyway.

281
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:35,672
Speaker 1: So long, long time ago.

282
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,718
Speaker 1: I remember Scott and I watch.

283
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:38,600
Speaker 1: It was like 2007, maybe late 2006.

284
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:49,980
Speaker 1: We watched we're in beacon, a youtube video that was just this kid and his dog who had powers and booties and it was just crazy.

285
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,502
Speaker 1: It was one of those awesome internet things in an era before crazy internet things were that common.

286
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:55,743
Speaker 1: yet.

287
00:16:55,763 --> 00:17:04,195
Speaker 1: They were still pretty common, not as common as they are now to where something crazy like this was notable among all the other crazy things that we remembered.

288
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:05,359
Speaker 0: It was moderately notable.

289
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:05,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

290
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:15,935
Speaker 1: And then somehow many years later it turned into a show and that show just kept going and still go and it was interesting.

291
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:19,188
Speaker 1: All these different waves of us encountering adventure time.

292
00:17:19,268 --> 00:17:22,442
Speaker 1: I remember going to like New York anime festivals.

293
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:26,657
Speaker 0: I remember going to New York comic con and there was a giant inflatable Jake.

294
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:27,180
Speaker 1: Yup.

295
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:27,983
Speaker 1: Huge.

296
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:29,810
Speaker 0: And I was like, Oh, I guess that's that thing.

297
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:31,457
Speaker 0: I guess that thing got pretty big.

298
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:34,049
Speaker 0: All right, go, go you people who liked that thing.

299
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:34,250
Speaker 1: Yup.

300
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:41,927
Speaker 1: And then I remember seeing tons of people wearing the fin hat and I was like, Oh, I wonder if that's going to be a thing like at cons, like ponies thing now.

301
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:42,450
Speaker 0: All right.

302
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:54,002
Speaker 1: And it and ponies and homestuck seem to be in this cluster of things that are continually appearing on the internet and at conventions, even anime conventions.

303
00:17:54,624 --> 00:18:09,352
Speaker 1: So I resolved at some point to watch a bunch of it, but late to the game, cause a bunch of our friends like you go in enough and all these other people we know had already watched adventure time and we're just watching it as it came out and we're super into it and I just kind of ignored it.

304
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:11,140
Speaker 1: Scott had kind of ignored it.

305
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:17,147
Speaker 1: So finally me and Emily are like, let's just watch it because this lemon grab thing, I got to know what the fuck that is.

306
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:23,656
Speaker 0: I saw that video of the guy going with the lemon coming out of his mouth and I was like, what the fuck is that to me?

307
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:24,681
Speaker 1: Like what the fuck was that?

308
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:32,197
Speaker 1: It's some adventure time lemon guy and I watch it and I still don't know what the fuck's up with that video, but it's an officially posted video from Cartoon Network.

309
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:41,209
Speaker 1: But basically voice actor of lemon grass started watching adventure time and I liked it for the first, I don't know, 10 episodes.

310
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:42,253
Speaker 1: I was like, this is really great.

311
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,684
Speaker 1: But then from that point on, I loved it.

312
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:46,894
Speaker 1: I went through the same progression of ponies of.

313
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:48,060
Speaker 1: this is pretty good.

314
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:50,391
Speaker 1: And then halfway through the first season, this is great.

315
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:54,305
Speaker 1: And then by the end of the first season, this is one of the best things.

316
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:59,547
Speaker 0: You know, I like adventure time a lot and it has a lot of greatness to it.

317
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,415
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say it's one of the best things there is.

318
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:09,865
Speaker 1: Well, let's see of current, of current and recent things as in TV show of any kind, what's better than adventure time right now?

319
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:11,130
Speaker 0: Oh, it's better.

320
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,520
Speaker 1: That's ongoing or recent show.

321
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,887
Speaker 0: Well, I mean recent, nothing really.

322
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:17,770
Speaker 1: I mean recent at all.

323
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,855
Speaker 1: Let's go back even three years.

324
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:20,524
Speaker 1: I mean, Monica, I guess was really good.

325
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:21,951
Speaker 0: I'd say Monica's right.

326
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:25,963
Speaker 1: Better in venture time probably a while ago and ended.

327
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:28,713
Speaker 0: It just shows you what kind of drought we're in.

328
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:29,055
Speaker 0: Yeah.

329
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:32,593
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a venture brothers, which I love, but you don't like.

330
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:35,845
Speaker 1: There's a Archer, which I love, but you don't like.

331
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:42,813
Speaker 1: There's ponies, which I love and you love, but I'm not going to pretend that season three is as good as season one and two.

332
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:43,094
Speaker 0: Right?

333
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,220
Speaker 0: So with ponies, right?

334
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,616
Speaker 0: I'm going to say artistically speaking, adventure time is way ahead of ponies.

335
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:48,519
Speaker 1: I will agree.

336
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:55,126
Speaker 0: Like a whole category up a whole level beyond, but in terms of, you know, which one would I rather watch?

337
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:58,017
Speaker 0: I give those a new ponies and a new adventure time at the same time.

338
00:19:58,379 --> 00:19:59,584
Speaker 0: Which one do I watch first?

339
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:04,005
Speaker 1: Before the third episode of season three of ponies, I probably would have still said pony.

340
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:05,351
Speaker 0: I say like coin toss.

341
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:20,083
Speaker 1: I think I want because ponies, I in season three, I started waiting a day or two and I watched the episode like Sunday or Monday, but adventure time, Emily and I pretty much download like the, the jankiest ass cap.

342
00:20:20,123 --> 00:20:23,777
Speaker 1: you can get from Bittorrent every Monday when it's out and watch it that night.

343
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:30,648
Speaker 0: I mean, when I started, you know, when I started watching the adventure time, I burned through it like, you know, fire on some dry as leaves.

344
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:34,223
Speaker 0: I think by now that I've finished it all, it's like a new episode came out.

345
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:34,846
Speaker 0: what a Monday.

346
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,293
Speaker 0: I haven't watched it yet.

347
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:38,062
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you've watched every episode up to that point.

348
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:38,666
Speaker 1: Yeah.

349
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:42,909
Speaker 1: I remember just pointedly, you were like, I'm only going to watch full seasons that are out.

350
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:44,777
Speaker 1: I'm not going to download these individual episodes.

351
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,912
Speaker 1: And then I think it was three or four days later.

352
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:49,078
Speaker 1: you just innocently asked.

353
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:49,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

354
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,190
Speaker 1: So potluck princess, that's the last one, right?

355
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,628
Speaker 0: Just saying, I thought it was going to be more difficult to get all the one shot.

356
00:20:55,648 --> 00:21:08,654
Speaker 1: I think also what happened was, cause you know, we're not gonna, I'm not spoilers, not really, but uh, the fourth season of adventure time actually does kind of end on a pretty big eska flow in a style cliffhanger.

357
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:21,050
Speaker 1: I wasn't really that hung, but it was not, did you not agree to not spoil eska flow in a, that was an eska flow in a style cliffhanger style.

358
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,392
Speaker 0: Okay.

359
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:22,599
Speaker 0: I don't know level, but style.

360
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:23,725
Speaker 1: I mean it was the same.

361
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:33,638
Speaker 1: The only reason it wasn't the same level is because adventure times plot that ended in that was only a few episodes long as opposed to 22 episodes long.

362
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:33,939
Speaker 1: Yeah.

363
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:38,889
Speaker 0: The thing with here is, um, let's get to this.

364
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,142
Speaker 1: Adventure time has a number of aspects to it.

365
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:43,005
Speaker 0: That's what I was going for.

366
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:54,426
Speaker 1: It has the sort of, it is crazy and every episode is just way different and you never really like it surprises you and goes into really interesting places all over the place all the time.

367
00:21:55,189 --> 00:22:02,732
Speaker 1: Two, it has a core set of extremely iconic, well done characters that are very strong and independently interesting.

368
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:11,336
Speaker 1: And three, it also has the nerd Gandalf girth world building all there in the background the whole time.

369
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:11,557
Speaker 1: Right?

370
00:22:11,577 --> 00:22:14,892
Speaker 0: So I see, I see that definitely Gandalf girth aspect, right?

371
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,482
Speaker 0: But here's is the way I see adventure time, right?

372
00:22:17,522 --> 00:22:21,857
Speaker 0: On the one hand, you've got sort of the, you know, the world building Gandalf.

373
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:27,657
Speaker 0: on the second hand, you have this dialogue that the characters have this way of talking.

374
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:40,184
Speaker 0: That's really the highlight and where at the one hand they talk really funny, but also sort of the way friends would talk, but also a little way more exaggerated than the way and clever.

375
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:41,710
Speaker 1: It's, uh, it's interesting.

376
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:53,778
Speaker 0: you say that because it's almost like if you took, right, you know, those fast talking, funny vaudeville types from the olden days, like a Groucho Marx of modern times talking to his friend, who's also a Groucho Marx.

377
00:22:53,859 --> 00:23:01,405
Speaker 0: And at the one hand it's, it's, it's, they talk funny, but no characters are really stupid, right?

378
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:04,916
Speaker 0: It's like, there's no straight man Abbott Costello situation.

379
00:23:05,036 --> 00:23:06,541
Speaker 0: Everyone is totally smart.

380
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:11,178
Speaker 1: Sometimes, sometimes it's like sometimes Jake just does really stupid things.

381
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:11,560
Speaker 0: Yes.

382
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,760
Speaker 0: People do dumb things and maybe they're weird or eccentric, but nobody's dumb.

383
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,987
Speaker 0: Even the ice King's not dumb, right?

384
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:22,601
Speaker 0: It's just, he has a weird motivations and such one person.

385
00:23:22,641 --> 00:23:25,972
Speaker 1: There's one dumb character who is cinnamon bun.

386
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:26,394
Speaker 0: Okay.

387
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:28,825
Speaker 0: Cinnamon bun is dumb, but cinnamon buns barely in the show.

388
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:29,810
Speaker 1: I like cinnamon bun.

389
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,934
Speaker 0: I don't like cinnamon bun.

390
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:33,123
Speaker 0: Um, yeah, everyone.

391
00:23:33,143 --> 00:23:37,238
Speaker 0: I mean, and you know, even some of the characters are super smart, right?

392
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:38,462
Speaker 0: Princess Volgum.

393
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,007
Speaker 1: You at Marceline too, I think.

394
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:40,549
Speaker 1: But anyway, you

395
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:42,134
Speaker 0: hit on

396
00:23:42,154 --> 00:24:01,101
Speaker 1: something because Emily and I were watching venture brothers and there's a scene in season four where two characters are flying a fighter jet and that show does the sort of, it always juxtaposes friends having one of those banter style conversations with like they're in a fighter jet doing something crazy.

397
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:03,993
Speaker 1: Like when you see Spiderman just had like talking normal.

398
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:05,077
Speaker 1: Well, I know what you're talking about.

399
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:05,680
Speaker 1: I love that.

400
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:31,584
Speaker 1: But we realized that sort of banter in adventure time and venture brothers is stylized banter because friends, like if you and I have our banter just in person, it feels clever and fun in this certain way because we're, it's like our own personal inside baseball, but someone else just seeing that would not find it terribly witty or terribly apt or apropos.

401
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:41,134
Speaker 1: It wouldn't have that professional polish, but if you take natural banter and put it in a show, it also loses that and seems kind of lackluster and cheap.

402
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:50,927
Speaker 1: If you stylize that banter to go one step beyond what normal people banter like, it feels emotionally the way real banter feels.

403
00:24:50,987 --> 00:24:56,811
Speaker 1: So it simulates the experience of having the banter with a friend by stylizing it with people who aren't actually real.

404
00:24:57,855 --> 00:24:58,999
Speaker 1: So I think that's why they do it.

405
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:06,729
Speaker 1: And that scene in venture brothers is this multi-minute conversation about a hooker they met and how horrifyingly depressing her breasts were.

406
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,985
Speaker 1: And it's, I was laughing out loud and almost crying by the end of it.

407
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:11,327
Speaker 0: All right.

408
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:17,343
Speaker 0: But the other aspect right is not quite with the world building, right?

409
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:22,879
Speaker 0: But with the, uh, the fact that every episode, right?

410
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:25,287
Speaker 0: There's, it's, everything is fresh, right?

411
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:29,741
Speaker 0: There's no like stock footage situation or reuse situation.

412
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:33,274
Speaker 0: It's a constant discovery of like, always new creatures.

413
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:34,220
Speaker 0: He goes in the forest.

414
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:35,648
Speaker 0: You don't see the same thing again.

415
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:36,953
Speaker 0: It's a new thing, right?

416
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:39,743
Speaker 0: It's like, Oh, in the background, new things.

417
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:43,438
Speaker 0: It's like, you're constantly exploring the world without stopping.

418
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:45,629
Speaker 0: It's not like they built the world and then living in it.

419
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:46,412
Speaker 0: Right?

420
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:56,895
Speaker 0: It's, it's, they just keep going out and out and out without stopping to new places in the world, but simultaneously they support the world building by being consistent with the things that they do show.

421
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:04,023
Speaker 1: Like once they show something, it is always pretty surprisingly consistent with the rest of everything that's going on.

422
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:07,882
Speaker 1: But I think the right way they're able to do that is that they're constantly shredding new ground.

423
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:17,364
Speaker 1: So the things they revisit are the few core things that they can spend all the time to make sure Marceline is consistent with the history and the timeline and all that stuff.

424
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:17,946
Speaker 0: Yeah.

425
00:26:17,986 --> 00:26:21,241
Speaker 0: But they'll, they'll never just like redo something they already did.

426
00:26:21,302 --> 00:26:25,864
Speaker 0: If there's like a character that appeared in like one episode and they bring it back, it's doing something new.

427
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:32,096
Speaker 0: Like spanking guy comes back and he's doing something totally different with these birds and they don't cheap out on the animation.

428
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:35,816
Speaker 0: They're always drawing new creatures and new backgrounds and new places.

429
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:38,972
Speaker 1: Even stuff that's only in an episode for like a couple minutes and then it's gone.

430
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:39,535
Speaker 1: Yeah.

431
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:41,826
Speaker 0: It's like other shows like don't have that kind of shit.

432
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:46,244
Speaker 1: Even Ren and Stimpy had a lot of low rent parts and re reuse crap.

433
00:26:46,284 --> 00:26:46,505
Speaker 1: Yeah.

434
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:48,937
Speaker 0: Or like the same characters over and over again.

435
00:26:49,017 --> 00:26:50,766
Speaker 0: It's like, come on guys, you know, do something new.

436
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:53,379
Speaker 0: I was like another mojo Jojo episode and powerpuff girls.

437
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:55,468
Speaker 0: Why don't you come up with some new bad guy?

438
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,102
Speaker 0: Why don't you use him more than three times?

439
00:26:58,122 --> 00:27:00,353
Speaker 1: Part of this is also, you know, I said the characters are really strong.

440
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:16,210
Speaker 1: I really liked the characters and it's not just because they're really well characterized and really sort of strong and iconic, both in the Matt Groening like silhouette way and just like the way they interact with each other and the way they, you know, their motivations and their histories and all that are just really consistent and well done.

441
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:24,995
Speaker 1: The characters themselves also often surprise me and I think it's because like you said, none of them are dumb.

442
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:27,003
Speaker 1: So they react like that.

443
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:30,115
Speaker 1: One of my favorite episodes in the whole show is Marceline's closet.

444
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:31,441
Speaker 1: That is just one of the funniest.

445
00:27:31,963 --> 00:27:36,280
Speaker 1: That spider pushes that laugh off the dresser and they're just like, what?

446
00:27:37,064 --> 00:27:40,601
Speaker 1: And then at the end where the spider bites him, I just, I, that's one of my favorite episodes.

447
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:44,021
Speaker 1: But the fact that the very end of the episode, Marceline is just like, okay, whatever.

448
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,329
Speaker 1: I hide in your house all the time.

449
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:46,192
Speaker 1: No biggie.

450
00:27:47,336 --> 00:27:53,817
Speaker 1: Like just the, that kind of stuff doesn't happen in other shows that otherwise could be like adventure time.

451
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,005
Speaker 1: They'll always fall back on a trope.

452
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,115
Speaker 1: Adventure time ends with the abrupt weird shit.

453
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:00,540
Speaker 1: Almost every episode.

454
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:05,333
Speaker 0: The number one abrupt is you're going to say when Jake's in his pocket.

455
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:06,335
Speaker 0: Yeah.

456
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,598
Speaker 1: He's smart.

457
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,262
Speaker 0: He's in my pocket the whole time.

458
00:28:09,282 --> 00:28:14,214
Speaker 0: Hey, the final thing, right?

459
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:18,305
Speaker 0: Is that adventure time is very bonus, right?

460
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:28,097
Speaker 0: And the way that it has sort of these cute characters in a fantasy world, it looks like it's going to be sort of a silly kind of situation

461
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:29,160
Speaker 1: most of the time, but

462
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:36,508
Speaker 0: it's actually, they go on this huge expansive adventure to find out the terrible secret of fantasy world as opposed to space.

463
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:36,970
Speaker 1: Yeah.

464
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,658
Speaker 0: But actually it is a terrible secret to space.

465
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,843
Speaker 1: That kind of is.

466
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:40,245
Speaker 1: Yeah.

467
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,053
Speaker 1: But like the Lich was actually like.

468
00:28:42,193 --> 00:28:48,133
Speaker 1: there's scary and serious sort of real plot mixed in with the crazy adventure time stuff.

469
00:28:48,314 --> 00:28:51,047
Speaker 1: And I liked the fact that all those elements are in the same show.

470
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:51,530
Speaker 0: Yep.

471
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:53,881
Speaker 1: I also liked the fact that it uses music.

472
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:58,781
Speaker 1: That's one thing that ponies did very well too is having music integrated with the show.

473
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:03,903
Speaker 1: I think Scott at least now understands why I keep singing these fucking songs just all the time.

474
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:07,177
Speaker 0: Even like, it's not even like ponies or winter wrap up is like a musical number.

475
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:10,288
Speaker 1: It's just like on a tropical.

476
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:15,345
Speaker 0: Jake is just things that there's barely like a fraction of a song, right?

477
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:17,152
Speaker 0: But it's just whoever came up with that.

478
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:18,580
Speaker 0: It's so good and catchy.

479
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,097
Speaker 1: And also I like tropical islands to begin with and I'll just look at suck in my head for like a week.

480
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:33,894
Speaker 1: I'll just be like, like I think what bothered Emily is the part that I like to say the most is rubbing it on my body or rubbing it on my body.

481
00:29:33,914 --> 00:29:40,822
Speaker 0: You see the top comment on youtube is someone make a video, rub it on my body on loop for 10 hours, please.

482
00:29:41,183 --> 00:29:44,438
Speaker 1: Well, like there's, there's one song that I found again recently.

483
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:52,736
Speaker 1: I was looking for an unrelated thing and it's just, they're kind of singing to each other and he's like, I'll stick my stick into your eye and you'll say, wow, wow, wow, wow.

484
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:55,287
Speaker 1: And that's been stuck in my head for a day and a half now.

485
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:56,453
Speaker 0: I don't remember that one.

486
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:57,138
Speaker 0: Randomly.

487
00:29:57,158 --> 00:29:59,272
Speaker 1: They're just singing about how they'll stick a stick in your eye.

488
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:04,855
Speaker 1: And then there's all these cute scenes for Finna, like pick Jacob all sweet and they'll like sing at each other.

489
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:08,109
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, and Jake is a musical dude.

490
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:09,395
Speaker 0: He has a little violin.

491
00:30:09,455 --> 00:30:11,967
Speaker 0: He's always playing it and shit, but see, that's the thing.

492
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:15,464
Speaker 1: He's like, he's got all these, the characters have all this stuff going on.

493
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:26,832
Speaker 1: They're approaching the complexity of a real character in a real serious thing or a for real like big production thing, but yet it's just all these short little vignettes and then that character stuff is just kind of there

494
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:41,573
Speaker 0: and you never, and it's, it's, you know, cool how usually when you have a character in a cartoon, you know, it'll be like that character will have an aspect and they'll just, you know, explode that one aspect and character characterize it, you know, over and over again.

495
00:30:41,593 --> 00:30:42,919
Speaker 0: It was an adventure time.

496
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:47,640
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, yeah, Finn's really great at adventuring and dungeons, but you know what?

497
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:57,627
Speaker 0: Every, most of the episodes, only two episodes where he dungeons and those are really good, but most of the episodes, it's like, he's actually doing something else and you're seeing some other aspect of him.

498
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,250
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

499
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:58,671
Speaker 1: Right.

500
00:30:58,832 --> 00:31:05,517
Speaker 1: But he's still, he's still in character when he's teaching flame princess, how to dungeon that episode.

501
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:06,119
Speaker 1: Right.

502
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:17,267
Speaker 1: Cause I just started thinking about dungeons and I like how the dungeons and everything, it's got that sort of trope of the trope aware character and that Finn's power seems to be that he just gets dungeons and gets it.

503
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:20,420
Speaker 0: I mean, there's the one episode that's pretty much just dungeon.

504
00:31:20,902 --> 00:31:21,947
Speaker 0: He jumps into the dungeon.

505
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:26,980
Speaker 0: He's like, I'm my element.

506
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,403
Speaker 1: I quote that line.

507
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:31,913
Speaker 0: And then it to shows the smartness and the competence he does.

508
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:33,419
Speaker 0: He fucking tears that dungeon up.

509
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,433
Speaker 0: It's not like, you know, oops, you know, up some other show.

510
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:37,740
Speaker 0: It'd be like, I'm awesome.

511
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,550
Speaker 0: I actually know I just got caught right away.

512
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,038
Speaker 0: It's like, no, he's a total bad-ass.

513
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,829
Speaker 0: He cuts up the dungeon cause that's his thing.

514
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:45,379
Speaker 1: I think that's most evident in the monsters.

515
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:46,523
Speaker 0: He grabs treasures.

516
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:47,326
Speaker 0: He gets an awesome.

517
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:51,027
Speaker 1: So the episode with the fight King where they go in and he's trying to tempt them.

518
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:52,555
Speaker 1: They're like, yeah, we walked through there.

519
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:54,103
Speaker 0: That guy is going to kind of a lake.

520
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:54,565
Speaker 1: Yep.

521
00:31:54,786 --> 00:31:55,831
Speaker 0: You did the giant dude.

522
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:56,434
Speaker 1: No, no.

523
00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:57,598
Speaker 1: That guy was great.

524
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,446
Speaker 0: But it's like, no one beats that guy.

525
00:31:59,908 --> 00:32:00,873
Speaker 1: But no, I'm talking about the fight.

526
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:03,086
Speaker 0: The farm that I'm thinking about the farm.

527
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:03,247
Speaker 0: Yeah.

528
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:06,203
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about the fight King where he's just, they're like, it's totally a trap.

529
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:06,686
Speaker 1: Yeah.

530
00:32:06,947 --> 00:32:10,572
Speaker 1: If we'd walked in there, the doors would have closed and he would have been like gladiators fighting ghosts.

531
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:15,353
Speaker 1: and then they're like, eh, and then they run back in and they get trapped because that's going to be fun.

532
00:32:16,197 --> 00:32:18,750
Speaker 0: It was a trap, but now you have to fight my gladiator ghost.

533
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:27,370
Speaker 1: We knew that I do like the serious parts of adventure time as much as I like the funny parts though.

534
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,644
Speaker 1: Like some of my favorite episodes are like the fact that the show will do.

535
00:32:30,664 --> 00:32:34,976
Speaker 1: I think the example I'll use is that Dexter's lab episode.

536
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:38,583
Speaker 1: That's just ha ha ha ha ha ha.

537
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:40,888
Speaker 0: Yep.

538
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:49,382
Speaker 1: That kind of experimental arthouse sort of fun stuff like adventure time as the episode where it's just the snow golem and that awesome little firewolf dude.

539
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:50,085
Speaker 0: Same thing.

540
00:32:50,506 --> 00:32:51,390
Speaker 1: Exact same thing.

541
00:32:51,570 --> 00:33:03,943
Speaker 1: The high concept episode, but they'll also have the series episode, like the doorlords episode with the, you know, them singing their songs is actually really kind of sweet and serious and poignant and it's kind of funny, but it's also kind of sad.

542
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:13,544
Speaker 0: and there the relationship between fan and princess bubble gum is actually, yeah, that's another, they always, you know, sort of explore new combinations of the existing characters, right?

543
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,131
Speaker 0: It's like, well, Finn and Jake.

544
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:24,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how, you know, or one of the earliest episodes is like, well, how do Finn and uh, the rainbow, whatever, what's her name?

545
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:25,909
Speaker 1: Lady Raina corn.

546
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:26,832
Speaker 0: How did they get along?

547
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:37,034
Speaker 1: I love how they got about that because then later in the, in the episode where magic man doesn't come back with the little mini people that when Jake's like, why is little Jake so sad?

548
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:39,645
Speaker 1: and things like, Oh, lady Raina corn dumped him.

549
00:33:39,946 --> 00:33:46,448
Speaker 1: She's dating someone better now and she's just making out with Finn that he like all that stuff.

550
00:33:46,488 --> 00:33:49,923
Speaker 1: And the fact that these little subtle callbacks and everything, I love adventure time.

551
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:55,633
Speaker 1: The thing, the one thing I got to say hard to not make the show just be, let's tell all our favorite anecdotes from the show.

552
00:33:55,693 --> 00:33:56,296
Speaker 0: No, I don't do that.

553
00:33:56,658 --> 00:33:57,583
Speaker 0: Is that actually?

554
00:33:57,623 --> 00:34:00,275
Speaker 0: don't think adventure time is really that funny.

555
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:03,146
Speaker 0: Like laughing out loud, hysterically rolling on the floor.

556
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:03,487
Speaker 0: Funny.

557
00:34:03,507 --> 00:34:05,876
Speaker 0: It's like there are some funny parts, right?

558
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:09,750
Speaker 0: But more of it is, is a lot like bone or it's just like this.

559
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:11,114
Speaker 0: It's like just awesome.

560
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:12,097
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah.

561
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:15,248
Speaker 0: As opposed to, you know, Oh my God, low.

562
00:34:15,268 --> 00:34:15,328
Speaker 0: Yep.

563
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:25,920
Speaker 1: But it has, it has hilarious moments, but they're interspersed with just baseline levels of entertaining and interesting or moderately funny.

564
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:36,067
Speaker 1: Like when there's the voice they use for a couple of different characters, like the demon with the bananas, when they're locked up in the nanosphere is like, sorry, I had to lock in there with the stuff.

565
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:49,103
Speaker 1: The fact that that guy was just so deadpan in hell, that kind of humor isn't, you're not going to just laugh out loud when there's just like a deadpan straight man in the middle of crazy demon hell, but it's amusing in and of itself.

566
00:34:49,143 --> 00:34:51,193
Speaker 1: And that amusement just kind of all builds up and builds up.

567
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:53,242
Speaker 1: And then later there'll be an unrelated.

568
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:56,614
Speaker 1: Jake farts in the pocket joke and they just crack up.

569
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,949
Speaker 0: What else is there to say about the times of adventure?

570
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:07,698
Speaker 1: Well, we could, we're not going to do it because we've got too much on our plate, but adventure time could easily have the radio free.

571
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:09,866
Speaker 1: equestria geek nights presents treatment.

572
00:35:10,127 --> 00:35:10,287
Speaker 0: Nope.

573
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:12,376
Speaker 0: I would love to do it.

574
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:13,661
Speaker 1: I would love to do it.

575
00:35:13,802 --> 00:35:15,690
Speaker 1: I would do it, but I don't have time for that shit.

576
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,111
Speaker 0: It's all.

577
00:35:16,151 --> 00:35:19,202
Speaker 1: you notice how one point Jake puts on the ice.

578
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:23,617
Speaker 1: King's fucking crown doesn't go crazy and nothing happens.

579
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,574
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, Finn puts on that crown and pretty much immediately turns into a wizard.

580
00:35:28,615 --> 00:35:30,061
Speaker 0: Probably only works on humans.

581
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:32,451
Speaker 0: Maybe or people who aren't already magic.

582
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:37,022
Speaker 0: It's basically already wizard stretchiness.

583
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:38,345
Speaker 0: He's basically luffy.

584
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:40,991
Speaker 1: I love how he basically is.

585
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,136
Speaker 1: nothing without his powers.

586
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:42,477
Speaker 1: He's just.

587
00:35:42,498 --> 00:35:44,887
Speaker 1: basically, it's the same as what became a human.

588
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:46,533
Speaker 1: He just doesn't want to do anything anymore.

589
00:35:47,015 --> 00:35:47,296
Speaker 0: Yeah.

590
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,332
Speaker 1: Though I think I no longer hear benders voice when I see Jake.

591
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:59,314
Speaker 1: Now I think of Jake when I watch Futurama, partly because Futurama is dead to me.

592
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:00,502
Speaker 1: It hasn't been funny for a long time.

593
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:01,810
Speaker 1: I'm kind of glad it's being canceled.

594
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:03,699
Speaker 0: He does do a slightly different voice.

595
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:06,452
Speaker 0: The voice is mostly the same, but it is crooks slightly.

596
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:10,808
Speaker 1: So it's going on, watch season one of adventure time again.

597
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:11,851
Speaker 1: And it's just like, Hey bender.

598
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:12,494
Speaker 0: Yeah.

599
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:14,220
Speaker 1: I see you're in the body of a dog now.

600
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:38,933
Speaker 0: And you're actually, your character is somewhat similar and that it is sort of the main character, but also sort of the side kick to the human main character, but also very main and also the sort of silly, you know, supporting person who provides more humor than seriousness, but also some amount of seriousness, you know, he's feeling the same role as bender in many ways with the same voice.

601
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:41,044
Speaker 0: And I think that's sort of just adds onto it.

602
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:41,366
Speaker 1: Yeah.

603
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:47,997
Speaker 1: But I think all these elements combined, kind of like how we talked about ponies is so remixed because it has this particular set of elements together.

604
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:59,158
Speaker 1: I think adventure time is one of the freshest shows on TV or at least one of the freshest animated shows because it's just got so many elements that freshen it up.

605
00:36:59,379 --> 00:37:04,578
Speaker 0: I mean, it's just modern, it's appropriate for this current, you know, the year 2013, right?

606
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:06,305
Speaker 0: It's for the time that it is made.

607
00:37:06,345 --> 00:37:09,642
Speaker 0: It's not like you watch something old and it's like, Oh man, that's so old.

608
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:16,810
Speaker 0: This is actually, you know, appeals to a modern sensibility made by modern young people, not something made by old people.

609
00:37:17,331 --> 00:37:19,037
Speaker 0: So trying to guess what the kids like.

610
00:37:19,257 --> 00:37:20,722
Speaker 1: Who's your favorite princess?

611
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:23,030
Speaker 0: Oh, favorite princess.

612
00:37:23,231 --> 00:37:27,305
Speaker 0: Because it's interesting because you, everyone has the same reaction.

613
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:36,061
Speaker 1: I'll say this, everyone hates lumpy space princess and doesn't even want her to be on screen until they realize it's hilarious to have her on screen.

614
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:37,307
Speaker 0: So the question is, right?

615
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:40,461
Speaker 0: It's like, are you talking about the favorite princess to be on screen?

616
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:43,515
Speaker 0: or like the princess that I would date or the princess that is.

617
00:37:43,676 --> 00:37:53,567
Speaker 1: We did all of them with ponies because I, so all right, princess on screen and then princess date, a princess on screen is probably love his face.

618
00:37:54,409 --> 00:38:01,151
Speaker 1: You know, you want these lobs that, that bit where they think they're invisible and they're fucking with her.

619
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:03,222
Speaker 1: and she's just like, you guys, how about the princess?

620
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:05,312
Speaker 0: You don't want to be on screen.

621
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:12,257
Speaker 1: You know, turtle princess is just kind of boring, boring and slow, but one could argue that that's the point.

622
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:13,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

623
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:23,163
Speaker 1: I mean, at least I can't say that that, that being the point would be bad because I argue that that being the point is good when an oshi movie is super slow and boring on purpose.

624
00:38:23,323 --> 00:38:24,328
Speaker 0: I can tell you the princess.

625
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,639
Speaker 0: I don't want to see again raspberry or a wildberry princess.

626
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:30,168
Speaker 0: No is bouncy castle princess.

627
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:31,656
Speaker 0: Cause that joke is only funny once.

628
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:33,507
Speaker 0: And it's like, what are you going to do with that again?

629
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:36,903
Speaker 1: Really notice how Finn didn't actually go inside her when everyone else did at the end.

630
00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:37,606
Speaker 0: Yeah.

631
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:38,289
Speaker 0: Yeah.

632
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,032
Speaker 1: I noticed that.

633
00:38:39,954 --> 00:38:53,073
Speaker 0: Um, but yeah, princess today, it's tough because you know, bubble gum princess is totally the best nerdy and sciency and awesome, but she's also kind of crazy, but she's kind of crazy.

634
00:38:53,094 --> 00:38:53,797
Speaker 1: You know what she is?

635
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:56,912
Speaker 1: She's a cross of Twilight sparkle and our friend Lisa.

636
00:38:56,932 --> 00:38:57,635
Speaker 1: Yeah.

637
00:38:57,715 --> 00:39:02,674
Speaker 0: I think if I'm going to go out with a princess, dr princess, dr princess is pretty good.

638
00:39:02,694 --> 00:39:03,900
Speaker 0: It's totally normal person.

639
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:04,645
Speaker 0: Like, Hey, what's up?

640
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:05,469
Speaker 1: See, it's tricky.

641
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:08,142
Speaker 1: Is Marceline allowed to be on the list because she's not a princess.

642
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:15,047
Speaker 1: She's not a princess because I prefer the vampire queen to any of the princess side that I've seen.

643
00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:16,192
Speaker 0: She's okay.

644
00:39:16,493 --> 00:39:16,996
Speaker 1: Slime princess.

645
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:17,921
Speaker 1: I haven't seen enough of.

646
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:18,866
Speaker 1: She's funny though.

647
00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:19,931
Speaker 1: The few times she's there.

648
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:20,394
Speaker 1: Yes.

649
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:22,324
Speaker 0: Hotdog prince is just sort of like, Hey, what's up too?

650
00:39:22,545 --> 00:39:22,766
Speaker 1: Yeah.

651
00:39:23,048 --> 00:39:25,260
Speaker 1: I like how they all are kind of vaguely obsessed with Finn.

652
00:39:25,381 --> 00:39:32,769
Speaker 0: Well, you got to remember that one episode where you know, the nice King and all the princesses show their true craziness.

653
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:33,150
Speaker 0: Yeah.

654
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:38,576
Speaker 1: They're all kind of crazy, but I think lumpy space princess wins out for being the most dangerously crazy.

655
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:39,199
Speaker 0: Yeah.

656
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,041
Speaker 0: And the thing is, is like lumpy space princess, the only one with parents and they do have crowns.

657
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,990
Speaker 0: So it's like, are they the lumpy space King queen?

658
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:48,798
Speaker 0: I assume they are, but they never say that.

659
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,966
Speaker 1: Well, we don't know a lot about the Kings and Queens because Marceline just calls herself the vampire queen.

660
00:39:54,986 --> 00:39:56,392
Speaker 1: I think she's actually a queen.

661
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:57,877
Speaker 0: No, she doesn't.

662
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:58,519
Speaker 0: There's no King.

663
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,141
Speaker 1: Yeah.

664
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:03,055
Speaker 1: And the ice King is the only King we've really interacted with.

665
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:04,340
Speaker 0: He's not even really a King.

666
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:04,922
Speaker 1: Yeah.

667
00:40:04,962 --> 00:40:08,898
Speaker 1: He just has a crown and is crazy and made a kingdom out of ice.

668
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,525
Speaker 1: I love the episodes.

669
00:40:10,545 --> 00:40:11,348
Speaker 1: We get flashback.

670
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:17,693
Speaker 1: The fact that his backstory is kind of, there's a few characters who are pre apocalypse and that whole storyline is just great.

671
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:20,767
Speaker 0: It is interesting that his, you know, that they made that storyline.

672
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:23,660
Speaker 0: Uh, but it doesn't make me like the ice King.

673
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,087
Speaker 0: I still think he's sort of annoying.

674
00:40:25,268 --> 00:40:25,710
Speaker 0: Exactly.

675
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,714
Speaker 1: But think about this.

676
00:40:26,914 --> 00:40:27,858
Speaker 1: Here's a meta here.

677
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:31,693
Speaker 1: Think about that guy or the crazy uncle with Alzheimer's.

678
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:33,642
Speaker 1: You don't want to be around that guy.

679
00:40:33,662 --> 00:40:35,330
Speaker 1: You don't want to deal with like.

680
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:45,389
Speaker 1: the guy, you know, who like is actually autistic and just, it's really hard to deal with them socially, but at the same time you can't hate him and you sympathize and empathize.

681
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:47,217
Speaker 0: I don't sympathize the ice King at all.

682
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:47,739
Speaker 0: Yeah.

683
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,958
Speaker 1: Guy who sacrificed his sanity to save a little girl in a post apocalyptic world.

684
00:40:51,978 --> 00:40:53,927
Speaker 0: Spoilers, I guess he's just an annoying dude.

685
00:40:54,269 --> 00:40:54,510
Speaker 1: Yeah.

686
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,344
Speaker 0: But that dude who sacrificed his life was a different dude.

687
00:40:58,364 --> 00:40:59,107
Speaker 0: That dude is dead.

688
00:40:59,689 --> 00:40:59,910
Speaker 1: Maybe.

689
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:11,273
Speaker 1: But at the same time, that episode where Marceline is just hanging out with him and he's just being crazy and she's singing his notes back at him and he doesn't even realize anymore is so sad.

690
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,059
Speaker 1: So sad.

691
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,387
Speaker 1: I get a little choked up every time I see that episode.

692
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:20,000
Speaker 0: To me, the ice King is like the annoying, not as good as the other bad guys.

693
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,722
Speaker 0: Bad guy.

694
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:24,232
Speaker 0: He hires a hit man.

695
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,458
Speaker 1: I thought that one was pretty good.

696
00:41:25,478 --> 00:41:28,511
Speaker 1: I liked him on screen and that hit man was pretty good.

697
00:41:28,551 --> 00:41:32,544
Speaker 0: The scorching, but it's like, come on.

698
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,993
Speaker 0: You know, there's real bad guys out there, right?

699
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:40,837
Speaker 0: Like I'm watching powerpuff girls and it's like, I don't want to see this mojo Jojo every other episode.

700
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:41,520
Speaker 0: I want him.

701
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,925
Speaker 0: I want amoeba boy.

702
00:41:43,006 --> 00:41:44,010
Speaker 1: Him is the only one I want.

703
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,193
Speaker 1: Him is the Lich.

704
00:41:45,434 --> 00:41:47,682
Speaker 1: Him is better than every other girls.

705
00:41:47,702 --> 00:41:48,545
Speaker 0: Him is better than the Lich.

706
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:58,197
Speaker 1: I think the thing is I like the Lich because the Lich, you know, this is just a smart and straightforward, actually bad guy.

707
00:41:58,498 --> 00:42:02,472
Speaker 0: Him is a straight and as a smart and straightforward, actually bad guy.

708
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:07,225
Speaker 0: He also has style and the Lich does not have style.

709
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:12,941
Speaker 1: The Lich reminds me of rezo of, Oh, you're here.

710
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:14,745
Speaker 1: Time for me to immediately

711
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:20,786
Speaker 0: has styled also not as much as him, but more than fricking the Lich style, but rezo or attitude

712
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:36,132
Speaker 1: and all these, a lot of other villains have a sympathetic side, but the, the Lich is kind of the only thing in the adventure time world that is pure, absolute unquestioning evil with no possibility of redemption.

713
00:42:36,152 --> 00:42:38,621
Speaker 0: Uh, playing princess is dead flame King.

714
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:42,555
Speaker 1: I think he's, he is evil in that evil is doing its job way.

715
00:42:42,595 --> 00:42:43,800
Speaker 1: Like he's the flame King.

716
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,587
Speaker 1: Of course he's evil though.

717
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:48,218
Speaker 1: I think flambo is one of my favorite characters.

718
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,303
Speaker 0: Flambo is pretty good.

719
00:42:49,323 --> 00:42:52,558
Speaker 1: He's like, I cast flame shield on you and I spit son.

720
00:42:52,618 --> 00:42:53,402
Speaker 0: You know, all right.

721
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:53,744
Speaker 0: All right.

722
00:42:53,784 --> 00:42:55,251
Speaker 0: You know which characters this all right.

723
00:42:55,331 --> 00:43:01,518
Speaker 0: Best side character that appears in only a few episodes, only a few lady rain accords, not in enough episodes.

724
00:43:01,598 --> 00:43:03,788
Speaker 0: I want to say her, but you know, who's better than that.

725
00:43:06,214 --> 00:43:08,079
Speaker 1: Uh, I like me now.

726
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,365
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to do the one, two, three choose goose.

727
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:11,348
Speaker 1: Aha.

728
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,214
Speaker 1: The choose goose is often forgotten.

729
00:43:13,435 --> 00:43:14,499
Speaker 0: Choose is so good.

730
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:22,510
Speaker 0: That actually the juice goose actually brings out the laughs because he, cause he's totally weird and wacky, but he's not stupid either.

731
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:27,386
Speaker 1: But in any other show they would overuse that character in that voice.

732
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:28,149
Speaker 0: Exactly.

733
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:30,946
Speaker 0: And he would be, it would get, you know, and they would make it a dumb character.

734
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:32,314
Speaker 0: It's like, no, choose goose is smart.

735
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:35,853
Speaker 0: He told you whatever he tells you was true and he gives you really good equipments.

736
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,185
Speaker 0: He also, when he's making fun of it, he's just the best.

737
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,271
Speaker 0: He's not fooling you.

738
00:43:39,311 --> 00:43:41,259
Speaker 1: He's making fun of Finn when Finn wants the armor.

739
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:44,651
Speaker 0: That's so I love, that's one of my favorite episodes.

740
00:43:44,731 --> 00:43:46,053
Speaker 0: One where he's got the armor that is.

741
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:57,792
Speaker 1: Well, the, you know, even inside of the show when magic man gives him the little miniature people and he's like, Oh, you know, these are, I left all the C listers in the bag.

742
00:43:58,536 --> 00:43:58,958
Speaker 0: Exactly.

743
00:43:58,978 --> 00:44:00,786
Speaker 1: Like he's only got the A-list characters out.

744
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:03,196
Speaker 0: So meta, but so true, but so meta.

745
00:44:03,216 --> 00:44:05,888
Speaker 1: I like how Peppermint Butler has a fucking dark streak.

746
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:07,696
Speaker 1: You know, that's coming back.

747
00:44:07,877 --> 00:44:10,912
Speaker 0: Well, it's already, you know, it already came back once in one episode.

748
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:12,239
Speaker 0: It's like Peppermint Butler, you know, death.

749
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:13,643
Speaker 1: Yeah.

750
00:44:13,743 --> 00:44:16,197
Speaker 0: It's like, Oh no, death is like, Oh, you know, Peppermint Butler.

751
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:17,062
Speaker 0: Why did you say so?

752
00:44:17,082 --> 00:44:18,529
Speaker 1: He's like, you'll owe me a favor.

753
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,728
Speaker 0: And then there's another episode where it's like, Oh, this will show you the aura.

754
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:23,351
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

755
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:26,042
Speaker 0: Peppermint Butler's like, let's not look at my aura.

756
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:31,879
Speaker 1: And, but all those things carry through like this very subtle thing.

757
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:40,631
Speaker 1: in one of the flashback episodes with Simon noticed how the candy goop was kind of interacting a little bit like the precursors, the candy people are evolving.

758
00:44:41,575 --> 00:44:41,936
Speaker 1: Yeah.

759
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:42,257
Speaker 1: Yeah.

760
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:46,211
Speaker 1: You're feeling we should do radio for you, but here's the question, right?

761
00:44:46,271 --> 00:44:49,723
Speaker 0: So did bubblegum princess make all the candy people?

762
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:53,476
Speaker 1: I think she is the, she and her bloodline.

763
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:57,851
Speaker 1: Well, I guess bubblegum line sugar line, sugar line, but she's only 18.

764
00:44:57,851 --> 00:44:58,392
Speaker 0: Yeah.

765
00:44:58,412 --> 00:45:00,620
Speaker 1: Cause she, we know a little bit.

766
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,870
Speaker 1: She has her, uh, you know, she had a mother and a father.

767
00:45:02,891 --> 00:45:02,971
Speaker 1: Okay.

768
00:45:03,071 --> 00:45:03,735
Speaker 1: Okay.

769
00:45:03,755 --> 00:45:05,543
Speaker 1: That was, that came up in the show.

770
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:06,568
Speaker 1: We know their names even.

771
00:45:06,588 --> 00:45:07,071
Speaker 0: All right, cool.

772
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:15,698
Speaker 1: So the question is she, her bloodline sugar line is the manifestation of that evolved semi-sentient thing.

773
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:22,038
Speaker 1: And that family over time created candy people from that elemental life essence of sugar.

774
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:22,500
Speaker 0: Right.

775
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,438
Speaker 0: So how did peppermint Butler who came out of that become all evil and shit?

776
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:28,246
Speaker 1: Cause they all have free will and agency.

777
00:45:28,266 --> 00:45:29,752
Speaker 1: He went off and hung out with death.

778
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:31,479
Speaker 0: I guess so.

779
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:32,805
Speaker 0: What's the story with that shit?

780
00:45:33,046 --> 00:45:33,226
Speaker 0: Yeah.

781
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:35,517
Speaker 0: Actually the episode did that happen?

782
00:45:35,557 --> 00:45:36,541
Speaker 1: So you want to forget all that.

783
00:45:36,581 --> 00:45:45,335
Speaker 1: There's only one episode that actually kind of creep me out when Finn gets knocked out and wakes up and Jake's just fucking crazy and everyone else is gone.

784
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:47,865
Speaker 1: That episode was actually pretty creepy.

785
00:45:48,106 --> 00:45:48,869
Speaker 0: Which one was it?

786
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:55,532
Speaker 1: where Jake's got a head injury and is living like a hobo and everyone's missing and the deer has kidnapped everyone.

787
00:45:57,037 --> 00:46:00,753
Speaker 1: That episode was kind of creepy because Jake always acts flibbity flobbity.

788
00:46:00,793 --> 00:46:02,300
Speaker 1: You know, I'm crazy Hamlet style.

789
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:05,710
Speaker 1: But in that, that episode he was Ophelia crazy.

790
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,040
Speaker 1: There aren't that many Ophelia crazy episodes.

791
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:10,885
Speaker 0: No, you can't overuse that.

792
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:11,707
Speaker 0: It would get old.

793
00:46:12,891 --> 00:46:13,172
Speaker 0: All right.

794
00:46:13,412 --> 00:46:14,115
Speaker 1: Yeah.

795
00:46:14,175 --> 00:46:16,825
Speaker 1: You guys can't tell adventure time super good.

796
00:46:16,865 --> 00:46:17,549
Speaker 1: We really like it.

797
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:23,658
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure everyone who's listening to this already knows people are not watching adventure time because they're stupid.

798
00:46:23,678 --> 00:46:26,530
Speaker 0: You know how many people told us to do a show in adventure time this week?

799
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:28,558
Speaker 1: Guys, the show, it's like.

800
00:46:29,361 --> 00:46:31,047
Speaker 1: the episodes are so short.

801
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:34,740
Speaker 1: You can just watch one like while you're brushing your teeth.

802
00:46:35,561 --> 00:46:35,722
Speaker 0: Yeah.

803
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:45,317
Speaker 0: If you also floss, even though this over in the fifth season, season, every season, you can watch the whole thing faster than you can watch like a whole anime.

804
00:46:45,377 --> 00:46:54,416
Speaker 0: Almost the problem I had is that I think it is still, I think there are, I think there may still be less seconds of adventure time than there are seconds of Utena.

805
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:54,978
Speaker 0: It's close.

806
00:46:55,299 --> 00:46:58,553
Speaker 1: I think there's more seconds of adventure time because we tend to only 39 full length episodes.

807
00:46:58,553 --> 00:47:01,363
Speaker 0: 39 times two is 78.

808
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:04,671
Speaker 0: How many adventure times are there?

809
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:07,458
Speaker 1: 26 per season, five seasons.

810
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:13,723
Speaker 0: So if you divide that in half because the episodes are only a little bit more adventure time than there is Utena.

811
00:47:13,904 --> 00:47:17,014
Speaker 1: Yeah, but adventure time is just great.

812
00:47:17,054 --> 00:47:23,139
Speaker 1: My only problem was we started watching it and after a few episodes we just would burn through like 10 episodes.

813
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:25,248
Speaker 1: then it go and then we ran out.

814
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:26,835
Speaker 0: That's the only way I watch things these days.

815
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:27,337
Speaker 1: Yeah.

816
00:47:27,357 --> 00:47:32,021
Speaker 0: And if I don't have an urge to watch something and burn through it, then I don't watch it at all.

817
00:47:32,222 --> 00:47:37,660
Speaker 1: Which is why House of Cards was great because they released the whole thing at once.

818
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,662
Speaker 1: So when I was like, I'm going to watch that show, I just watched the whole thing at my own pace.

819
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:46,978
Speaker 1: I had no point had to deal with Escaflowne bullshit cliffhangers.

820
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:49,850
Speaker 0: Now the thing I don't see, I like that method, right?

821
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:57,200
Speaker 0: But the method I like better than that, that no one has done yet, as far as I can tell, is don't have like some sort of schedule, right?

822
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,435
Speaker 0: Just make the show and as soon as an episode is done, put it up.

823
00:48:00,696 --> 00:48:02,103
Speaker 0: And as soon as the episode is done, put it up.

824
00:48:02,143 --> 00:48:07,649
Speaker 0: So if one episode is real easy to do and it took you an hour, you put it up an hour after the previous episode.

825
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:11,286
Speaker 0: As soon as you have the thing mastered and ready to upload, upload it.

826
00:48:11,386 --> 00:48:21,032
Speaker 1: My only regret is not as you go, not watching the show closer to when it was coming out meant that much like when all our friends read the Prince of Nothing before we did, I missed out on that wave.

827
00:48:21,173 --> 00:48:22,700
Speaker 1: Everyone's talking about it now.

828
00:48:23,161 --> 00:48:24,446
Speaker 1: I'm the guy late to the party.

829
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:25,491
Speaker 0: Whatever.

830
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:27,017
Speaker 1: Luckily, Scott watched it.

831
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,531
Speaker 1: So now we have a little party going again, which is fine.

832
00:48:29,572 --> 00:48:36,702
Speaker 1: And what I was getting at is that even with Prince of Nothing, every time new people read it, we would have a wave of everyone talking about it again.

833
00:48:36,782 --> 00:48:38,551
Speaker 1: And the wave just gets bigger every time.

834
00:48:38,953 --> 00:48:41,263
Speaker 1: One of my coworkers is reading the Prince of Nothing right now.

835
00:48:41,303 --> 00:48:46,260
Speaker 1: He just, he was like, yeah, he just left the guy behind in the woods.

836
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,889
Speaker 0: Is it a smart person who knows how to read?

837
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:48,171
Speaker 1: Yeah.

838
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,082
Speaker 1: The guy knows the guys into that kind of stuff.

839
00:48:50,142 --> 00:48:50,725
Speaker 0: Okay, good.

840
00:48:50,785 --> 00:48:53,638
Speaker 1: So he basically, he was like, yeah, Kelly, that's way early.

841
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:54,764
Speaker 1: Kelly's just left that guy behind.

842
00:48:54,784 --> 00:48:56,455
Speaker 1: He just started reading it in the woods.

843
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,528
Speaker 1: He's like, I just met the spy who's also a wizard.

844
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:04,046
Speaker 1: And I was like, and his friend, the, and I was like, yeah, I like the friend, the priest.

845
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:06,599
Speaker 1: And he was like, yeah, well let's see what happens.

846
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:10,295
Speaker 1: He's just, he's like, I got past the proper noun bullshit.

847
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:11,662
Speaker 1: I think I see what's going on here.

848
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:18,813
Speaker 1: And I know he's smart cause he's like, you know, when he left the guy behind in the woods, that said a lot about what's going on.

849
00:49:18,853 --> 00:49:20,841
Speaker 1: I was like, yep, that said a lot indeed.

850
00:49:22,506 --> 00:49:23,629
Speaker 1: All right, we're done.

851
00:49:23,649 --> 00:49:25,193
Speaker 1: I think venture time.

852
00:49:25,715 --> 00:49:26,798
Speaker 0: It's not a veggie time anymore.

853
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,425
Speaker 1: Well, I just, I'm one episode ahead of you.

854
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:30,267
Speaker 0: Oh no.

855
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,276
Speaker 0: So I don't have a story to go.

856
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:34,139
Speaker 1: Favorite.

857
00:49:34,399 --> 00:49:37,988
Speaker 1: Not that commonly recurring character is magic man.

858
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:38,549
Speaker 0: He's such a jerk.

859
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:49,380
Speaker 1: The fact that the moral was how much of a jerk I am and how the whole thing in Mars and all that stuff just reinforces.

860
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:58,830
Speaker 1: And I wonder, I wonder if he ever will actually come back because that I'm not coming back is the kind of crap that the show does that I love.

861
00:49:58,851 --> 00:50:02,993
Speaker 1: And I wonder if he will come back because notice how he was just talking about that episode.

862
00:50:03,154 --> 00:50:03,536
Speaker 1: I don't know.

863
00:50:03,576 --> 00:50:09,094
Speaker 1: Cause notice how the show implied that he has a backstory much like Simon's.

864
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:10,819
Speaker 0: It didn't imply it.

865
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,514
Speaker 1: They showed the whole thing, but they didn't actually tell you what actually happened.

866
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,210
Speaker 1: They just showed you enough evidence to surmise that.

867
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,897
Speaker 1: there's a similarly tragic backstory.

868
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:23,671
Speaker 1: and we still don't know how Marceline became a vampire yet.

869
00:50:23,992 --> 00:50:32,204
Speaker 1: We just know about what age had happened to her and we know that she was a half demon already, which would make her super long lived, but not immortal.

870
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,556
Speaker 1: She's only immortal because of the vampire.

871
00:50:35,576 --> 00:50:37,904
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure she was always a vampire.

872
00:50:37,924 --> 00:50:39,007
Speaker 1: No, we know.

873
00:50:39,168 --> 00:50:39,689
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

874
00:50:39,729 --> 00:50:40,451
Speaker 1: She wasn't one.

875
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:41,414
Speaker 1: No bite marks.

876
00:50:41,434 --> 00:50:43,923
Speaker 1: when she's a kid to vampires don't age.

877
00:50:44,123 --> 00:50:51,657
Speaker 1: She aged up to a point and stopped aging three in the alternate reality where she didn't get bit by a vampire because all the other bullshit didn't happen.

878
00:50:51,998 --> 00:50:58,423
Speaker 1: She got way old by the point where she would have met Finn in the normal universe where she is not old.

879
00:50:59,547 --> 00:51:02,519
Speaker 1: This is why maybe I need to get someone else to do radio for you with me.

880
00:51:03,821 --> 00:51:04,885
Speaker 1: I kind of want to do it now.

881
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:05,849
Speaker 0: Yeah.

882
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:07,174
Speaker 0: What exactly are the borders of the land?

883
