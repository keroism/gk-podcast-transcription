Speaker 1: very briefly and somewhat disorganized Lee we talked about Kinetic on.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:39,160
Speaker 1: Well, it's Wednesday the Wednesday before Otak on which means I don't know how how good our show will be tonight because we got to get on the road at like 8 in the morning.

7
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:40,907
Speaker 0: I'm doing laundry as we speak.

8
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,115
Speaker 0: I have unpacking things as we speak.

9
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:52,088
Speaker 0: I'm rearranging the computer Still putting together two of our panels and Tomorrow morning in the car we go to be more.

10
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:53,231
Speaker 1: Oh and don't forget.

11
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:54,815
Speaker 1: We might have a sixth panel.

12
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:56,600
Speaker 1: what we'll see about that?

13
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:59,452
Speaker 0: Well only four of the panels we're doing so.

14
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:03,280
Speaker 1: yes one of them will be there, but Katzen or you'll be doing most of it.

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:13,807
Speaker 1: I'll be up there in armor fighting for my honor that smelly armor I feel bad for you and Scott will be in the background far away from the fighting with a video camera to catalog my Untimely demise.

16
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:14,976
Speaker 0: yeah, that'll be worth it.

17
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:20,336
Speaker 1: I guess Yeah, but you know once again welcome all you.

18
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:21,140
Speaker 1: Kinetic on listeners.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,231
Speaker 1: I'm sure you're here for the con report that we promised yesterday.

20
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:29,615
Speaker 1: as you know geek nights is four nights a week blah blah blah and Wednesdays is anime manga and comics.

21
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:35,220
Speaker 0: Oh my god Are we gonna talk about anime manga comics not a lot?

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,036
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about an anime con because you know as I said we're going to Otak on tomorrow.

23
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,040
Speaker 1: things are a little crazy.

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,635
Speaker 0: I don't know that you know before we actually get to it.

25
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:42,937
Speaker 0: You know.

26
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:43,340
Speaker 0: I don't know.

27
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:44,709
Speaker 0: I mean sure we're gonna do.

28
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,758
Speaker 0: we are gonna do the Kinetic on review tonight But I really feel either it should have been split up into Tuesday Wednesday or more.

29
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,982
Speaker 0: really I think more.

30
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:55,693
Speaker 0: just Tuesday Kinetic on is an everything geek con.

31
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:58,200
Speaker 0: It's not just anime manga and comics.

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,842
Speaker 0: You know it's all.

33
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:03,780
Speaker 0: it's got web comics, but it's got a lot of gaming going on there a lot.

34
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:08,460
Speaker 0: And you know I feel like maybe even the Kinetic on review should be on a Tuesday.

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,912
Speaker 0: Or maybe we should move all convention related things to Thursday, or I don't know.

36
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:20,453
Speaker 1: see what I'm thinking is anime cons We should talk about on Wednesdays Cons we should talk about on Tuesdays Kinetic on and things like that.

37
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:22,800
Speaker 1: We should probably talk about on Thursdays.

38
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:27,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that's okay, then because you know what we were supposed to do a Thursday episode this week.

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,063
Speaker 0: What do you say?

40
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,980
Speaker 0: we put this episode up and just tomorrow now?

41
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,675
Speaker 1: We should put it up tonight because it's a Wednesday show.

42
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,105
Speaker 0: yeah But I mean it should be.

43
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,740
Speaker 0: you know we are supposed to do a Thursday this week and not a Wednesday.

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:46,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are recording it Wednesday because we have to leave Thursday, so Whatever, it'll be a Wednesday show because we said it would be and we'll kind of rearrange all this business.

45
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:46,746
Speaker 0: It's okay.

46
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,724
Speaker 0: We can do some post-hoc retcon Haha later.

47
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:58,817
Speaker 1: and also just in case you're wondering we're gonna be out of town next week on our annual writers retreat Which is a codename for doing jack and shit and fuck and all.

48
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,792
Speaker 0: but Have no fear and you're in mom.

49
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:09,615
Speaker 1: for the many previous years We would have guest hosts of geek nights and this year We I totally dropped the ball and didn't follow up on any of that at all.

50
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:10,960
Speaker 0: I mean we had some volunteers.

51
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:12,726
Speaker 1: We didn't really follow up.

52
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,074
Speaker 0: We went around and some people agreed to it.

53
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:16,940
Speaker 0: some people couldn't do it on time.

54
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:26,467
Speaker 0: Basically we are too busy doing other shit, and we didn't do it and we suck however Instead of not doing shows for a week.

55
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,576
Speaker 1: We're gonna be in Wildwood, but we've got internet access.

56
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:32,252
Speaker 1: We've got a Marantz We've got our microphones.

57
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,080
Speaker 1: We've got everything.

58
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:36,880
Speaker 1: We're gonna do some geek nights live at the beach.

59
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,480
Speaker 0: We're gonna try to do some geek nights live at the beach.

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,359
Speaker 1: I promise there will be at least one episode of geek nights uploaded at some point next week.

61
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,090
Speaker 0: That is very likely more than one.

62
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,114
Speaker 0: I wouldn't bet.

63
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:49,580
Speaker 1: maybe not maybe or four.

64
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:53,028
Speaker 0: No to it most people.

65
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:53,851
Speaker 0: that's what you're gonna get.

66
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:54,253
Speaker 0: maybe?

67
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:55,920
Speaker 1: yeah, we might have geek nights live at the beach.

68
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:57,820
Speaker 1: We might have geek nights live in Atlantic City.

69
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,306
Speaker 0: Also, here's something else right.

70
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:13,463
Speaker 0: if you want to do a guest episode of geek nights and you can record it and edit the whole mp3 and do the whole thing on your own and Email either email it to us or better yet email us a link to a place We can download it.

71
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:17,774
Speaker 0: then we could actually go and pretty easily.

72
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:23,905
Speaker 0: if we just go to internet cafe You know go and add it to the website, so all right I'm gonna say it right now.

73
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:27,060
Speaker 1: not many of you are capable of doing no very few people.

74
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:32,600
Speaker 0: I mean we're gonna listen to it And we're gonna make a pretty quick judgment like within a minute of whether we deem it worthy.

75
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:38,700
Speaker 1: You mean like all those people who came from Connecticut and have already turned us off exactly exactly all right.

76
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,702
Speaker 1: So we're unlike the normal format of geek nights because you know we got to get this show on the road as in go to Baltimore.

77
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:49,860
Speaker 1: so we're gonna dispense with the usual news and kind of just right get right into this Connecticut thing.

78
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,492
Speaker 1: But first I do want to point out last weekend Connecticut this weekend Otakon.

79
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:04,538
Speaker 1: so August 8th 9th and 10th We're gonna be in Baltimore at Otakon doing a ton of live shows too many if there is such a thing.

80
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:08,448
Speaker 1: so Friday noon to 1 in panel 1 anime.

81
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:13,280
Speaker 1: you should see this has been the standing room only like batshit crazy panel.

82
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,909
Speaker 0: I don't know why but I guess it works.

83
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:16,671
Speaker 1: I know exactly.

84
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:17,936
Speaker 0: do it works right?

85
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:20,587
Speaker 0: if you don't understand it You don't like it.

86
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,220
Speaker 1: It's confusing, but we know we understand exactly.

87
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:24,991
Speaker 1: It's easy to get into anime.

88
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:26,500
Speaker 1: a lot of people got into anime.

89
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:29,453
Speaker 1: They don't know what to watch after they watch it.

90
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:30,035
Speaker 0: You know what I'm gonna.

91
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:34,940
Speaker 0: Do is after that panel I'm gonna ask people like why they came to it and really see what they're thinking.

92
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,121
Speaker 0: Well,

93
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:41,119
Speaker 1: we asked him last year and more than half the crowd raised their hands at I don't know what to watch now

94
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:41,944
Speaker 0: Uh-huh,

95
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:48,880
Speaker 1: and then like the other third was pretty much It was a half of them were I don't know what to watch and the rest didn't really were non-committal.

96
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:52,600
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yeah, and you know it is kind of hard to figure out what to watch.

97
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,489
Speaker 1: I mean how many good shows are there?

98
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,956
Speaker 1: not just an anime, but in any.

99
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:56,820
Speaker 0: this is what I don't get.

100
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:58,666
Speaker 0: I mean It's like these people.

101
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:10,049
Speaker 0: the only explanation I could think of is that these people don't talk to anyone And they don't go on the internet at all and they don't even read Scott Scott, and they don't even What magazine tells you what anime is good.

102
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,459
Speaker 0: it tells you at least something.

103
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:17,100
Speaker 0: it It might tell you wrong, but at least you'll listen to it and watch something bad.

104
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:21,540
Speaker 1: No, and then they watch bad things and everything they watch is bad, and then they stop watching anime.

105
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:22,751
Speaker 0: I know, but what what?

106
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:23,719
Speaker 1: do they go on the internet?

107
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,741
Speaker 1: Where do you?

108
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:29,880
Speaker 1: unless you listen to animal world order us or maybe fast karate people are gonna tell you to watch bad shows?

109
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:37,954
Speaker 1: Probably there's really nowhere to get Reliable recommendations for anime to watch except geek nights anime world order and fast karate.

110
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:40,220
Speaker 0: for the gentleman there had to be somebody.

111
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:41,725
Speaker 1: I defy you.

112
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,490
Speaker 0: it's gotta be some blogs out there.

113
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,711
Speaker 1: All right.

114
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:44,613
Speaker 1: There's one blog.

115
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,740
Speaker 1: That's okay that ba ba suga su.

116
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,140
Speaker 1: However that blog reviews everything and the reviews really kind of glowing.

117
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,798
Speaker 0: I mean these people really must live under a rock if you go.

118
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,998
Speaker 0: gee I don't know what anime to watch at all.

119
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:56,180
Speaker 1: I mean.

120
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,625
Speaker 0: I think we just I know too many.

121
00:06:57,665 --> 00:07:00,074
Speaker 0: I know more anime to watch than I can watch.

122
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:01,720
Speaker 1: no anime that you know are good.

123
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,085
Speaker 1: I mean basically think of this.

124
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:05,152
Speaker 1: you just got into anime like you've.

125
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:08,785
Speaker 1: someone said hey watch this anime you watch Akira And it was awesome.

126
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:10,832
Speaker 1: and now in a vacuum you think all right.

127
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:11,816
Speaker 1: I liked Akira.

128
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:12,860
Speaker 1: I like anime.

129
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:15,373
Speaker 1: What should I watch?

130
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:21,020
Speaker 0: at the very least I go to the best But I look at the shelf and I pick something judging on the cover way way way in the title way.

131
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,608
Speaker 1: That's not gonna get you very far.

132
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:23,010
Speaker 1: Yeah.

133
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,271
Speaker 1: Well.

134
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:25,040
Speaker 1: No it won't go to Best Buy.

135
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:34,316
Speaker 1: Anyway, I think I understand exactly why this panel is because it is hard to find out What good anime is out there because the industry is not conducive to people watching good anime anymore.

136
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:34,778
Speaker 1: Well.

137
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:35,400
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

138
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:36,565
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

139
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:37,227
Speaker 1: I misspoke.

140
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:40,220
Speaker 1: the anime industry is not conducive to existing anymore.

141
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:48,328
Speaker 1: Anyway Friday 3 p.m.. To 4 p.m.. In workshop 1 Comics for the manga reader.

142
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,115
Speaker 0: yeah, this is a panel I came up with.

143
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,168
Speaker 0: I didn't plan it But we could just wing it.

144
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,942
Speaker 0: we're at each in each convention We're doing.

145
00:07:53,962 --> 00:08:03,638
Speaker 0: we're gonna wing one panel sort of and the basic idea this panel Is that a lot of the people at Otacon are gonna be people who like anime and people who like manga.

146
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:04,320
Speaker 0: those are gonna be?

147
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,029
Speaker 0: You know big interest for them.

148
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,863
Speaker 0: I mean there are video game fans There.

149
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:15,478
Speaker 0: you know all sorts of geeks there but mostly there's gonna be anime and manga geekdom even more anime than manga.

150
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:23,000
Speaker 0: right and All these manga readers right obviously enjoy comics because manga is comics, and they enjoy manga.

151
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:24,565
Speaker 0: There's a manga library there.

152
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,431
Speaker 0: They'll be people in there reading manga.

153
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:27,936
Speaker 0: They paid all this money to read manga.

154
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:28,979
Speaker 0: They must like it.

155
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:36,740
Speaker 0: But these people don't tend to read American comics and I've been American but non-japanese comics.

156
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,995
Speaker 0: I partly understand any from any publisher.

157
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:44,559
Speaker 1: because one You're not gonna find a lot of those really good French comics anywhere accessible or you'll know what they are.

158
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you go looking for American comics unless you know where to look you're gonna find mostly underwear perfect.

159
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,410
Speaker 0: Yes, I mean you could pre-order with the crazy spreadsheet.

160
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,153
Speaker 0: who's gonna do that?

161
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:56,236
Speaker 0: who isn't on the inside?

162
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:57,782
Speaker 0: you go to a comic-book Store.

163
00:08:57,983 --> 00:09:00,595
Speaker 0: who's gonna do that or doesn't have body odor and a giant gut.

164
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:01,600
Speaker 1: Oh, that's real harsh.

165
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:04,255
Speaker 1: I know it's morning thing all right go to you go to a comic.

166
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:05,060
Speaker 1: you go to borders.

167
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:06,607
Speaker 1: Well, no the way you buy the manga.

168
00:09:06,627 --> 00:09:09,620
Speaker 1: the problem is you go to a comic store, and it's mostly underwear perverts.

169
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:21,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, you go to a borders where all the manga is and there is a shelf of you know non manga comics And it's so disorganized and difficult to figure out what's what and you don't even know what any things are.

170
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:27,500
Speaker 0: More importantly it's all underwear pervert mostly, but you know more and more.

171
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:27,884
Speaker 0: There's not.

172
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,624
Speaker 0: this is not underwear perverts on there But not that much.

173
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:34,516
Speaker 0: I would say about 25% at the average borders will be not underwear perverts.

174
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:35,620
Speaker 0: That's a job space.

175
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:36,448
Speaker 1: That's not enough.

176
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:37,659
Speaker 0: It's not enough at all.

177
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:45,724
Speaker 0: But 25% of the non manga graphic novel shelf space will be not underwear perverts on the average at the average borders I've been to.

178
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:50,119
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah, the thing is even so a lot of it You can't tell unless you don't even know what it is.

179
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:58,604
Speaker 0: So we're gonna tell at this panel Pete manga readers what non manga comics They would probably like.

180
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,129
Speaker 1: I'm gonna spoil the panel right now.

181
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:08,799
Speaker 1: Batman the Dark Knight Returns Watchmen V for Vendetta Scott Pilgrim Runaways Anything by Brian gave.

182
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:11,500
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna do a whole aside.

183
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:14,409
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna do an aside about alright.

184
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:15,332
Speaker 1: There's also manga.

185
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:16,856
Speaker 1: You should read that none of you probably have.

186
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,020
Speaker 0: maybe we'll see.

187
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:23,060
Speaker 0: Imagine I think over the way we'll tie it in is we'll say these are the great mangas this one.

188
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:24,460
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that great manga.

189
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:30,720
Speaker 0: Like if you like that great manga Then you'll like these great non manga and then picking and then we're done with that thread.

190
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:33,400
Speaker 0: We'll pick another great manga and then continue.

191
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:37,172
Speaker 1: But anyway, I don't want to get into this long discussion of all our panels now.

192
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:38,636
Speaker 0: Friday 8 p.m.

193
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:44,194
Speaker 1: To 9 p.m Panel 3 We're doing know your creators from Osamu Tezuka to Osamu Tezuka.

194
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:46,100
Speaker 1: I don't think we need to say much more about that.

195
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:47,010
Speaker 1: I think that'll be fine.

196
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,680
Speaker 0: We're gonna tell people Pay-attention to who the hell makes your anime and your manga.

197
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,851
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's important the end Saturday morning 10 a.m.

198
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:54,573
Speaker 1: To 11 a.m.

199
00:10:54,693 --> 00:11:07,603
Speaker 1: In workshop - we are doing Advanced Wars because Otacon was desperate for panels and I happen to have suggested this as like a second string panel Earlier in the year and they basically came back before the con and said yeah Could you run that?

200
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:08,709
Speaker 1: and I said, oh, yeah, sure.

201
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:09,895
Speaker 0: I think we could do.

202
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:11,000
Speaker 0: we didn't have a better suggestion.

203
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,984
Speaker 0: They could have faked instead.

204
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:13,390
Speaker 1: Well, we're already doing.

205
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:19,420
Speaker 1: know your creators comics for the manga reader anime You should see and we could have done beyond D&D instead of Advanced Wars.

206
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,909
Speaker 1: That's so less related to anime.

207
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,194
Speaker 0: I know I know.

208
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:28,930
Speaker 1: however, however I've been talking to them and there is a tiny chance.

209
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,880
Speaker 1: We might run beyond D&D Saturday morning at some point.

210
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,980
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, because best panel we came up with this year.

211
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,818
Speaker 1: Basically, the gist of all this is come to the geek nights tables in the artist alley.

212
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:49,680
Speaker 1: You will find us we have 11 of them and Over there, we'll have our schedule posted on our table and we might be doing extra panels all over the place.

213
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,704
Speaker 1: So make sure you stop by.

214
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:54,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, we all have a little stand-up schedule and we'll have a little stand-up something else.

215
00:11:55,482 --> 00:12:02,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott only said that because he knows that I happen to have bought two table tripods Yep, and of course on Sunday from 1 p.m.

216
00:12:02,577 --> 00:12:02,697
Speaker 1: To 2 p.m.

217
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,969
Speaker 1: Katsunori Matsushita will be talking about kendo the way of the sword and all I can say is that Katsu runs one fucking kendo panel.

218
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I heard that the one from last Otakon was too epic.

219
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,731
Speaker 0: The Katsu-Kan one was mildly epic.

220
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:17,876
Speaker 0: It was a little smaller room.

221
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:18,800
Speaker 0: I think it hindered him.

222
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,059
Speaker 1: I think the small room is the only thing that held him back.

223
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:23,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think that the Otakon won.

224
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:30,940
Speaker 0: I see no reason why it wouldn't be as epic as the last one Especially since Katsu will be very excited to hit rim with a stick and rim will be very unhappy.

225
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:33,980
Speaker 0: Not that he gets hit with a stick which won't really hurt wearing armor.

226
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:40,310
Speaker 0: But I will no longer be the undefeated honorable vice president To be in a really smelly sweaty armor.

227
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:41,995
Speaker 1: Oh that armor is real smelly.

228
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:43,640
Speaker 0: It's it's full of bo anyway.

229
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:51,420
Speaker 1: Yep, and of course Saturday from 1 to 2 the Apple geeks panel and panel 2 with our good friends talking enough.

230
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:52,631
Speaker 1: Oh, very nice very nice.

231
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:55,427
Speaker 0: We'll probably be there I think panel at the same time don't we?

232
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,857
Speaker 1: Saturday from 1 to 2 we most definitely don't.

233
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:59,729
Speaker 1: okay awesome I don't know where you got that.

234
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:01,080
Speaker 0: there was something at the same time.

235
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,749
Speaker 1: I forget whatever at the same time.

236
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:04,900
Speaker 0: the Apple Geeks panel is better than anything at the same time.

237
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:09,418
Speaker 1: Make sure you come by our table because we are going to be scheduling other things throughout the con.

238
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:13,299
Speaker 1: for example We have our tradition of going to the ultra-violent movie.

239
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:18,195
Speaker 1: If you I'm not gonna talk about it cuz we have to decide which ones we're going to.

240
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:21,289
Speaker 0: but I want to go to that Bushido one and I want to go to machine girl.

241
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,857
Speaker 1: I think I only want to go to machine girl.

242
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:30,139
Speaker 1: That's fine I don't want to go to the other ones so much but basically we will be scheduling things that we are going to go to.

243
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,860
Speaker 1: and If you're gonna be at Otakon check our schedule.

244
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:35,852
Speaker 1: And if you want to be where the awesome is be where we're gonna be.

245
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:37,960
Speaker 0: yeah on our little schedule probably have events.

246
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,171
Speaker 0: We're running events our friends are running and then events.

247
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:43,419
Speaker 0: We are attending so that you know where we're gonna be at.

248
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:52,951
Speaker 1: Anyway, it is time for things of the day.

249
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:54,957
Speaker 1: I've got something real light real quick.

250
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:55,920
Speaker 1: I just thought this was cute.

251
00:13:56,481 --> 00:14:01,515
Speaker 1: It's a comic by Sarah Mensinga called dragon girl, and it's really short.

252
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:02,598
Speaker 0: It's a generic name.

253
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:03,380
Speaker 1: there it is.

254
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:11,611
Speaker 1: It's a really simple short comic, and it's just you know 20 or so Images accompanied by 20 or so paragraphs attacks, then isn't that's?

255
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:13,195
Speaker 0: and that's not a comic.

256
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:14,539
Speaker 0: That's more of a light novel.

257
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:18,594
Speaker 0: Light novel yeah, incredibly light novel.

258
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,180
Speaker 1: I would call it a comic.

259
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,493
Speaker 0: It's not a comic if it's the art isn't sequential.

260
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:23,740
Speaker 1: the art is sequential.

261
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:28,211
Speaker 1: It just has a very long sequence.

262
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:30,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see we'll see.

263
00:14:30,258 --> 00:14:30,780
Speaker 0: anyway continue.

264
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:34,095
Speaker 1: I don't see any reason why you wouldn't call this a comic if nothing else.

265
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:37,305
Speaker 1: I'd call it a one-off webcomic Because it could be.

266
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:41,100
Speaker 0: it's an illustrated work of prose as opposed to a comic which are two different things.

267
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,574
Speaker 0: There's a line at which you go from illustrated book to comic.

268
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,480
Speaker 0: There's there's a very distinct line there.

269
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,220
Speaker 1: See I don't make the distinction at all and I couldn't care less.

270
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,899
Speaker 0: There is there's a very very important artistic distinction that we won't get into now.

271
00:14:54,642 --> 00:14:57,190
Speaker 1: Fine it is a rough illustration and text.

272
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,313
Speaker 1: good God Scott.

273
00:14:58,775 --> 00:14:59,577
Speaker 0: I know I didn't look at.

274
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:00,400
Speaker 0: it might be a comic.

275
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:01,362
Speaker 1: It's.

276
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:06,640
Speaker 1: it's a really cute little story about a king and a little girl who is kidnapped by dragons.

277
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:08,400
Speaker 0: Does the king have an awesome beard?

278
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,902
Speaker 1: Actually, he does.

279
00:15:09,982 --> 00:15:10,886
Speaker 0: I'm totally reading it.

280
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:11,668
Speaker 0: He does.

281
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:13,715
Speaker 0: is this is the king awesome.

282
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:15,020
Speaker 1: Uh no not really.

283
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:19,917
Speaker 1: Basically all I'm gonna say is it's cute, and I really like the ending even though.

284
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:20,680
Speaker 1: It's a little cliche.

285
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,704
Speaker 1: I thought it was cute.

286
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:22,206
Speaker 0: All right.

287
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:23,030
Speaker 0: That's it.

288
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:23,953
Speaker 1: Yeah.

289
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:27,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, so check this out I'm not sure, but I have.

290
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:30,359
Speaker 0: basically this is a really quick thing of the day.

291
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:32,766
Speaker 0: What fleshes it out as I have suspicions?

292
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:33,809
Speaker 0: all it is.

293
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:35,213
Speaker 0: the video is pretty simple.

294
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,500
Speaker 0: some people at a Tokyo?

295
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,827
Speaker 0: Convention Center are on an escalator.

296
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:43,840
Speaker 0: so many people are on the escalator the escalator goes in reverse and they all fall off.

297
00:15:45,581 --> 00:15:46,243
Speaker 0: Now that's it.

298
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:47,768
Speaker 1: no no that's funny.

299
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,416
Speaker 0: It is pretty funny, but here's the thing I have.

300
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:53,207
Speaker 0: suspicions number one No the top.

301
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:58,915
Speaker 0: well it could have been not the weight of the people But there were a lot of people on there, but someone flicking the switch.

302
00:15:59,257 --> 00:15:59,780
Speaker 0: It's possible.

303
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,594
Speaker 0: Another thing all the people on there are nerdy looking dudes.

304
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:05,638
Speaker 1: You're thinking.

305
00:16:05,658 --> 00:16:06,340
Speaker 1: It was not like comic.

306
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,466
Speaker 0: I think this is a comic at situation.

307
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,770
Speaker 0: That's my suspicion.

308
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:13,040
Speaker 0: so someone watch this video and then confirm or deny.

309
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,727
Speaker 0: Okay, that's all I got.

310
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:21,429
Speaker 0: and you know watching people fall off an elevator elevator Elevate escalate it's an escalator.

311
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, not too many people fall on elevators.

312
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:26,147
Speaker 0: No It's pretty funny because you do.

313
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:29,456
Speaker 0: the thing keeps coming down and the people keep spilling off of.

314
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:32,900
Speaker 0: it causes like spill spill Spills bills, but it just doesn't stop.

315
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:34,495
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

316
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:40,340
Speaker 1: You know I have a little bit more trouble laughing at own videos when it's not the person getting owns fault.

317
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:42,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're not owned too badly.

318
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,792
Speaker 0: It's pretty much you.

319
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:44,294
Speaker 0: I burped there.

320
00:16:44,455 --> 00:16:45,157
Speaker 1: That was fantastic.

321
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:45,940
Speaker 0: I know it's pretty much.

322
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,966
Speaker 1: We're all about professional.

323
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,918
Speaker 0: it's pretty much just fall off get up fall off get up fall off get up.

324
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,438
Speaker 0: lots of screaming It's no one's really good.

325
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:54,928
Speaker 0: No, one's really getting owned here.

326
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:56,435
Speaker 0: It's just sort of like oh, no.

327
00:16:56,777 --> 00:17:03,669
Speaker 1: Oh, no All right, okay, so I don't know how long we'll spend on this But we're gonna give you at least a brief overview.

328
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,982
Speaker 1: slash counter part of kinetic on 2008 which we were at Already.

329
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:09,367
Speaker 0: you want to do chronological.

330
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:09,749
Speaker 1: What do you?

331
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:14,288
Speaker 0: let's just do this chronologically all right, so we went there Late-ish Friday.

332
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:16,920
Speaker 1: well they originally and I was gonna take work off.

333
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,925
Speaker 1: I ended up not like all this business.

334
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:22,106
Speaker 1: we ended up getting in you know late on Friday and Friday night.

335
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,200
Speaker 1: the con was basically dead.

336
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we got there.

337
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:27,773
Speaker 0: There was nothing happening.

338
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:29,340
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell if there are any events.

339
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:32,489
Speaker 0: You know we discovered they had a new layout for the con.

340
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:33,973
Speaker 0: everything was really sparse.

341
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,518
Speaker 0: there weren't a lot of people.

342
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:37,063
Speaker 0: there wasn't anything Happening.

343
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:37,926
Speaker 0: you know we.

344
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:39,029
Speaker 0: it was pretty.

345
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,394
Speaker 0: it was really not.

346
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:41,237
Speaker 0: it was very bad.

347
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,391
Speaker 0: Basically, that's the only word I can come up with.

348
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:44,833
Speaker 1: I mean just.

349
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:46,563
Speaker 0: I tried to think of a nicer word But I couldn't.

350
00:17:46,885 --> 00:17:47,428
Speaker 1: well it was just.

351
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:48,674
Speaker 1: you know we show up in the world.

352
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:49,740
Speaker 1: things kind of came together.

353
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,569
Speaker 1: We got our badges we dealt with all that, but it was just.

354
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,055
Speaker 1: there was really no one around.

355
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:54,040
Speaker 1: there wasn't any energy.

356
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:02,884
Speaker 1: Like there was a very small crowd of people kind of very morbidly and slowly and quietly and grumbly Wandering about and that was it.

357
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:06,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was very Blair, and I wasn't getting a good feeling.

358
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:08,348
Speaker 0: I had a pretty Pessimistic view.

359
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:15,038
Speaker 0: as soon like we were there for maybe 15 minutes on Friday, and I was looking not forward to the Saturday and the Sunday.

360
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,744
Speaker 0: I was like oh This is gonna be real bad.

361
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:17,989
Speaker 0: It's gonna be no good.

362
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,740
Speaker 0: I can tell already I got bad vibes all over the place.

363
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:21,190
Speaker 0: No good.

364
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:29,660
Speaker 1: No good Yeah, so basically we just decided to go to our hotel You know how we're not here, and we left because we weren't actually supposed to show up till Saturday anyway.

365
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:31,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't really do anything Friday.

366
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,205
Speaker 0: We basically walked around real quick said hi to people got badges Didn't do so much.

367
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:38,386
Speaker 0: Well.

368
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:39,332
Speaker 1: We went to the hotel room.

369
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:40,257
Speaker 1: We watched some Ava.

370
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:41,403
Speaker 0: all right We watched that.

371
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:46,559
Speaker 0: we watched Ava up from my iPhone to the TV pretty cool And I played a bunch of Civ 4 and we went to bed.

372
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:47,947
Speaker 0: Here's a tip for people.

373
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:57,259
Speaker 0: if you want to connect something to your hotel television It's all fancy, but the input button on the side You know cuz they always give you a weird remote and the weird remote doesn't give you the input buttons, right?

374
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:00,959
Speaker 0: But there's an input button on the side of the television that doesn't seem to be working.

375
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,940
Speaker 0: Disconnect the telephone cord from the television and now the input button will suddenly work Because it's no longer talking to the hotel system.

376
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,353
Speaker 0: And then when you're done plug the phone cord back in and no one will say wary.

377
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:20,395
Speaker 1: at some hotels that sets off an alarm And somehow it's all that you will not be able to turn off An alarm that says someone is stealing the television.

378
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:23,269
Speaker 0: however at the hotel We were at it didn't do that so it was all good.

379
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,524
Speaker 1: either that or no one was watching that alarm Which is fine?

380
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:30,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but but my one warning is that that alarm is not always silence.

381
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:31,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's also true.

382
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:35,960
Speaker 0: usually though a lot of times the alarm cord is a little different from the other ones.

383
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,742
Speaker 0: It's a little more.

384
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:39,652
Speaker 0: You know physically secured more thoroughly.

385
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,300
Speaker 0: You know like have a big metal lock on it of some kind.

386
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:44,506
Speaker 0: You know anyway Why would you do that?

387
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:47,560
Speaker 1: because as long as the if as soon as it gets broken the alarm goes off and then you send?

388
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,186
Speaker 1: Someone up to the room.

389
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:49,339
Speaker 1: They can't get a TV out that quick.

390
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:53,600
Speaker 0: Well the idea is that you know we slow them down and getting the TV out.

391
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,890
Speaker 0: They lock not only that cable, but the other one.

392
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,040
Speaker 0: so it's like if they break the alarm cable.

393
00:19:58,482 --> 00:19:59,870
Speaker 0: You know that anyway forget it.

394
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:01,579
Speaker 0: talk about Connecticut, okay?

395
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,157
Speaker 1: Because I don't think you've seen these things so much before what they look like anyway.

396
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:05,760
Speaker 0: I've seen a bunny.

397
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,745
Speaker 0: I've been a lot of hotels.

398
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:09,076
Speaker 1: have you now mr.. Hotel big shot.

399
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:13,069
Speaker 0: Yes No, I've never been to hotels before Scott's.

400
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:15,294
Speaker 1: he did now except for Connecticut.

401
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:16,117
Speaker 0: right right.

402
00:20:16,137 --> 00:20:33,500
Speaker 1: so Saturday morning We wake up early because we have the anime match game scheduled for two hours on Saturday morning from 8 a.m.. To 10 a.m.. Now the only Concern I had was that we had not yet met the people at the convention who were responsible for us being there.

403
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:40,900
Speaker 1: We had figured out we had the match game because we got a schedule Went through it looking for names of events that we had submitted and assuming that they were ours.

404
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,031
Speaker 0: Yeah, last year when we arrived at Connecticut.

405
00:20:43,071 --> 00:20:44,397
Speaker 0: They had badges for us.

406
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:50,280
Speaker 0: right well They had to make one for me But they had them and they had our names on a list to prove that we were actual guests.

407
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:56,913
Speaker 0: They checked us out to make sure we were guests And then they had pre-printed itineraries telling us what to do.

408
00:20:57,796 --> 00:20:59,040
Speaker 0: that was pretty cool this year.

409
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:05,108
Speaker 0: We walked in and we said hey, we're geek nice Basically and we had to make our own badges.

410
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:08,560
Speaker 1: well basically the thing is what happened was we walk in we're like all right.

411
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,625
Speaker 1: Hey, we're getting nice badges.

412
00:21:09,966 --> 00:21:12,919
Speaker 1: and the funny thing is I see katsu's badge on the top of the stack.

413
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:18,317
Speaker 1: Yep, it was like why does katsu have a badge, but the person who got him a badge doesn't have a badge.

414
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:25,073
Speaker 1: luckily We didn't even have to argue or anything because the con chair Recognized us because we're at every freaking major con on the east.

415
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:25,917
Speaker 0: was it the con chair?

416
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:26,560
Speaker 0: is it someone else?

417
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,767
Speaker 1: That was the con chair all right, so he's like.

418
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:34,898
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you guys you recognize me actually and not Scott at first alrighty, and then he's like oh, okay, whatever.

419
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:42,927
Speaker 1: and The point that basically the con chair asked us where the panels person was which we said Great, so you know we Saturday morning.

420
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:53,106
Speaker 1: We go to our match game, and we're getting ready to go, and then we're thinking all right our Convention guests going to show up so we can run this or Not.

421
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:59,140
Speaker 0: and well last year last year They didn't tell us whether or not we actually had guests, and we couldn't get a confirmation all day.

422
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:03,945
Speaker 0: But when we showed up to the panel guests appeared Miraculously awesome guests.

423
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:05,370
Speaker 1: that was actually a really good match game.

424
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:14,834
Speaker 0: the thing that really got me worried about this year was not just that They didn't tell us guests were coming or not But because it was 8 a.m.. Guests don't like to make up at him and to.

425
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:21,100
Speaker 0: if I looked at the convention book There wasn't really people who were good guests for anime match games.

426
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,700
Speaker 1: I was like even if they said guess who are they gonna say they were awesome guests.

427
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,638
Speaker 1: I mean don't get me wrong actually a fan of some of these people But they are not going to be able to deal with the air.

428
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:33,491
Speaker 1: well You know what they probably could have dealt with our anime match game.

429
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:39,210
Speaker 1: just fine because after we had Peter Fernandez on and we kind Of rewrote everything we have two sets of questions.

430
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,660
Speaker 1: the everyone is a hardcore anime fan.

431
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:44,800
Speaker 1: Let's go set and the people kind of know anime.

432
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,980
Speaker 1: Let's have generic magic game questions with an anime thing.

433
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:56,230
Speaker 0: I definitely think that the that the only raid that the people kind of know anime match game works is If the people on the panel have enough star power.

434
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:04,177
Speaker 0: if they weren't big star amazing people Then you really can only get by with the very knowledgeable match game or else.

435
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,120
Speaker 0: It won't be entertaining.

436
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:10,676
Speaker 1: So there's Scott and I are sitting in a room Basically alone and no one's in the panel.

437
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:15,813
Speaker 0: so we're like alright People trickled into the con and people actually trickled into the room.

438
00:23:16,014 --> 00:23:18,329
Speaker 1: yeah, but I'm saying at first no one was there And we're like awesome.

439
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:19,240
Speaker 1: This is gonna be awesome.

440
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,558
Speaker 1: You know people trickle in bit by bit.

441
00:23:21,204 --> 00:23:35,613
Speaker 1: So we basically just start Talking to each other on stage and kind of talking to the audience a lot like geek nights actually And we kind of just did geek nights for about a half about 20 minutes or so Yeah, and the crowd kept growing and growing and the thing is no one left.

442
00:23:35,653 --> 00:23:39,620
Speaker 1: in fact people kept coming in to see what was Going on and sitting down the crowds growing and growing.

443
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:47,618
Speaker 1: We did an abbreviated version of know your creators because we weren't running it at the con And we didn't have the index cards because we weren't running it at the con.

444
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:49,000
Speaker 0: actually I thought we were running at the con.

445
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:52,140
Speaker 0: I forgot the index cards, but didn't matter because we weren't running it at the con.

446
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:55,740
Speaker 1: Yes, so you know we do that and everyone loved it.

447
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,594
Speaker 1: And then eventually there was a pretty large crowd in the room, and they're all being entertained.

448
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:04,974
Speaker 1: so we stopped and said wait a minute You guys want us to just run the match game for you guys.

449
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:06,179
Speaker 1: and the crowd was like oh my god.

450
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:13,619
Speaker 1: And there are actually some people in the audience from last year who showed up only because they remembered How absolutely badass the match game was last yeah?

451
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:17,979
Speaker 0: And the girl who bothered us all year and wanted a prize is actually not annoying.

452
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:19,648
Speaker 0: She's just like I want my prize.

453
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:20,251
Speaker 0: I'm like okay.

454
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,236
Speaker 0: I brought some prizes here.

455
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:21,618
Speaker 0: take them.

456
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:29,202
Speaker 1: yep Sadly the t-shirts that we were also going to give here her are arriving a Friday morning at Otacon.

457
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:32,534
Speaker 1: great, so I'm gonna mail her one as soon as we get back before packs.

458
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:35,205
Speaker 1: okay, so if you're listening yes You're gonna get your t-shirt.

459
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:35,547
Speaker 1: Yes.

460
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:40,620
Speaker 1: It's awesome alrighty, but so This actually started this one really well.

461
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,373
Speaker 1: We got uncle yo up and I got to say uncle yo has gotten better and better.

462
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:51,313
Speaker 1: at the anime comedy like every time I see him he's funnier on stage, and he's trying real hard.

463
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:53,180
Speaker 0: I mean you know you got to give the guy some credit.

464
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:55,048
Speaker 0: He tries he's putting everything.

465
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:57,780
Speaker 0: He's got into that and he's you know he's improving himself.

466
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,059
Speaker 0: Which is what you got to do?

467
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,640
Speaker 1: I mean well one thing listen to the first few episodes of geek nights say no more.

468
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:07,613
Speaker 1: But I gotta say this as a match game guest.

469
00:25:07,894 --> 00:25:08,957
Speaker 1: He was hilarious.

470
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:09,760
Speaker 1: I kind of want him.

471
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:12,997
Speaker 1: I always want him to be my ringer if we don't have enough guests.

472
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:13,600
Speaker 1: that was great.

473
00:25:14,022 --> 00:25:22,960
Speaker 0: And the other thing is what I did is that when we were trying to select people for the game I actually sort of quiz the audience to get you know people who actually knew about anime.

474
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,228
Speaker 0: I was like who knows what a road to katochi is?

475
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:28,300
Speaker 0: and one guy said legend of the overfeed and I said who knows what?

476
00:25:28,747 --> 00:25:34,385
Speaker 0: you know Itano circuses and one guy knew and I was like yes And the best part is we were.

477
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:37,717
Speaker 1: I mean we figure with these game shows people might lie or something.

478
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:41,572
Speaker 1: so at first we're like All right, if you lie and get yourself up here.

479
00:25:41,793 --> 00:25:43,540
Speaker 1: You're only gonna make a fool out of yourself.

480
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:46,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I also I asked questions, and I made sure the people answered them.

481
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,210
Speaker 1: So there's no way that they were lying.

482
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:54,734
Speaker 0: it was like it was trivia And it was hard anime trivia And I was very surprised that people in the audience actually knew like.

483
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:55,557
Speaker 0: I'm surprised.

484
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:56,400
Speaker 0: I got one person.

485
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:59,120
Speaker 0: It was pretty good, and yeah They're great panelists.

486
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,092
Speaker 1: It was funny because one of them I was like who is seen Gundam?

487
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:06,429
Speaker 1: and everyone raised their hand and I was like double Oh 80 and all the hands of a two went down.

488
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,772
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know we get these people up and Running this match game.

489
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:11,720
Speaker 1: Just kind of winging it.

490
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:18,008
Speaker 1: It was real fun like everyone had a super good time and people kept coming in to the point that Just as the panel was ending the room was half full.

491
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:21,640
Speaker 0: yeah, but not not super full like it was last year.

492
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,410
Speaker 0: But that was because the guests, but here's the deal.

493
00:26:24,972 --> 00:26:27,280
Speaker 1: this started a trend that kind of surprised me.

494
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:30,555
Speaker 1: We're at Kinetic on right which is not an anime con.

495
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:34,680
Speaker 1: it is a geek Webcomic gaming anime con like all these rolled into one.

496
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,786
Speaker 0: It's very in fact.

497
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:38,320
Speaker 0: I'd say there's more web comics and gaming than anime.

498
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:42,857
Speaker 1: I mean what anime stuff was happening at a con has better gaming than most gaming conventions.

499
00:26:42,898 --> 00:26:43,540
Speaker 1: I've said that before.

500
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,606
Speaker 1: I'll say it till I die.

501
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:44,887
Speaker 1: Yeah.

502
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:45,148
Speaker 1: Good.

503
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:47,320
Speaker 1: God is the tabletop gaming at Kinetic on vent.

504
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:48,965
Speaker 0: Just cuz they have enough tables.

505
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,778
Speaker 0: I mean ubercon didn't have enough tables at that hotel in Jersey.

506
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:57,012
Speaker 1: the only thing They're lacking is Luke crane And I'm going to do everything within my power to get him.

507
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,525
Speaker 1: he is going to pecs right yes And we'll all get to that a hundred percent.

508
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,110
Speaker 1: Yes, all right in fact.

509
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,253
Speaker 1: I've worked out to where he's.

510
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:07,205
Speaker 1: he's going to be ready Hopefully I mean we got it.

511
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:15,175
Speaker 1: unless something that comes up to run a burning wheel the sword or something demo Immediately following our beyond Dungeons and Dragons panel awesome.

512
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,320
Speaker 0: is he gonna be on our panel though?

513
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:17,324
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

514
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:19,012
Speaker 1: I think he might be in the audience.

515
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:20,900
Speaker 1: my plan would be he could be in the audience.

516
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:22,672
Speaker 1: We do the panel cuz I think he'd really like.

517
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:25,660
Speaker 0: oh, and then we and then we do that We praise him at during the panel.

518
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:33,986
Speaker 1: I'll just because I want to I'd love to see him in person like sitting there in an audience where he is called by two Strangers a rock star.

519
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,651
Speaker 1: yeah, I'd love to see that.

520
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:38,499
Speaker 1: and then I'd love to be like ladies and gentlemen you're a rock star.

521
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:41,439
Speaker 1: Let's say yeah, we'll see what happens.

522
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:56,073
Speaker 1: But this trend that at every panel we ran, and I'm saying every single panel at Kinetic on There were more hardcore knowledgeable awesome anime fans here than at any anime con we've ever been to that we did.

523
00:27:56,113 --> 00:28:00,687
Speaker 1: panels at we at katsu khan were like How many of you have seen cowboy bebop?

524
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:04,420
Speaker 1: and out of a hundred and twenty people like a third of them raised their hands?

525
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,867
Speaker 0: It was pretty shameful.

526
00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:07,238
Speaker 0: I was like oh my I was in pain.

527
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:10,020
Speaker 1: We go we were here right at this panel.

528
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,986
Speaker 1: I'm like you know.

529
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:11,630
Speaker 1: here's some anime.

530
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,274
Speaker 1: You should see you know.

531
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:13,280
Speaker 1: We're just talking in the beginning.

532
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:15,588
Speaker 1: I'm like millennium actress blah.

533
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:22,370
Speaker 1: I start naming Satoshi khan stuff and someone's like yeah, Satoshi khan I'm like wait How many of you have seen all of the Satoshi khan's movies?

534
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,000
Speaker 0: and like everyone raised their hand and is the one girl like the?

535
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,936
Speaker 0: Back left corner who had seen every anime in the known universe.

536
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:33,537
Speaker 1: Oh god She was a little excited, but but it was great cuz she wasn't lying at the at the very end.

537
00:28:33,557 --> 00:28:41,754
Speaker 1: you know at anime You should see which we did later We're like oh real quick And we're rattling off like obscure good anime or at least anime that you should probably watch.

538
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:50,478
Speaker 1: and as soon as we started to say Jojo's Bizarre Adventure she ran up and showed us the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure PVC that she had just bought.

539
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:59,992
Speaker 1: yeah But yes Every single panel we ran had hardcore Amazingly knowledgeable anime fans.

540
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:11,960
Speaker 0: that was the hardest core match game We've ever run outside of the RIT anime club and by announcing what panel I mean at every panel We said these the panels are doing later these the panels are doing later, and it worked.

541
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:17,680
Speaker 0: We saw the same people come to all these panels one after the other because they enjoyed our earlier panels so much.

542
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:21,480
Speaker 0: I couldn't believe like it's never worked before, but it totally worked a hundred percent.

543
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:25,159
Speaker 1: I don't want to sound like we're full of ourselves, but we were basically rock stars by the end of the con.

544
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:31,208
Speaker 0: I know it was really weird the kinetic on size wise Smaller than a lot of other cons we'd go to.

545
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,940
Speaker 0: you know smaller than Otacon smaller than KanzaCon by a lot, right?

546
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,111
Speaker 1: You know I think it's actually now with our new no small cons policy the smallest convention We attend.

547
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:41,844
Speaker 0: yeah But you know what?

548
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:49,789
Speaker 0: for some reason we had such a stronger and bigger connection with the fan base at Connecticut than we had at any con ever.

549
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,254
Speaker 1: yeah, and it was.

550
00:29:51,335 --> 00:30:02,411
Speaker 1: it was really cool like the audiences We're really into it And they seem to really enjoy it and it seems like audience members are going around like I saw people in the halls Telling other people to go to the rest of our panels, and they did.

551
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:06,962
Speaker 0: but like you like every hallway I walked down every room I went into.

552
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:09,069
Speaker 0: there were people that I had seen earlier in the day.

553
00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:10,735
Speaker 0: there are people that I knew.

554
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:13,912
Speaker 0: you know on some level They were and there were people.

555
00:30:13,993 --> 00:30:17,705
Speaker 0: I saw them one day And then they played a game with them the next day And I'm like I remember you.

556
00:30:17,987 --> 00:30:18,369
Speaker 0: in fact

557
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:33,502
Speaker 1: out of all this there was a bunch of cool geeks we ended up playing a long game of power grid with on Sunday and a bunch of them played in like the burning wheel stuff and Now these people are cool enough to where they're probably going to be joining one of our burning wheel games like here in our real Lives.

558
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,268
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean I played the sword.

559
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:44,833
Speaker 0: I ran the sword for some people on Saturday night And then on Sunday we played this incredibly long game of power grid And one of the dudes who was in my sword was in the power grid.

560
00:30:44,853 --> 00:30:45,597
Speaker 0: I was like I remember you.

561
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:48,572
Speaker 1: yeah So basically every panel we did.

562
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:53,573
Speaker 1: so the next panel you know later in the day And they pretty much if you didn't get it at this point Friday was dead.

563
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:55,400
Speaker 1: Saturday was rocking in a big way.

564
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:57,108
Speaker 0: No, we're super rocking.

565
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:58,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we do.

566
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:04,470
Speaker 0: I mean I don't know about the con itself, but as far as we were concerned the con was rocking Which is all I care about because that's what we promised.

567
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:09,198
Speaker 0: we say if we go to a con No matter how much the con sucks we will rock and we fulfilled.

568
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:16,060
Speaker 1: well We'll get to that because actually there were very few real complaints about the con as far as the con feedback session was concerned.

569
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:22,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, so next we did anime You should see and the fun thing was that panel.

570
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:29,300
Speaker 1: that panel probably needed to be in main events because there was a line Like 20 minutes before filling the hallway.

571
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:32,206
Speaker 0: I don't have a need to be in main events But it could have definitely been a panel one.

572
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:33,129
Speaker 0: easily we.

573
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,020
Speaker 1: the room was filled to the point that every single seat was taken.

574
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,408
Speaker 1: Every possible space on the floor was filled.

575
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:41,300
Speaker 1: there were people standing up like against all of the walls.

576
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:43,051
Speaker 1: There are people standing in the doorway.

577
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:43,836
Speaker 1: the door was open.

578
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:49,660
Speaker 1: people were like Standing in the hallway with their heads in and there was a crowd outside being turned away for fire code.

579
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,123
Speaker 1: You know what?

580
00:31:50,163 --> 00:31:51,251
Speaker 0: I'm thinking we got to do.

581
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:52,640
Speaker 0: Here's what I think with anime.

582
00:31:52,700 --> 00:32:03,533
Speaker 0: You should see right on it twice and be no I can at Otakon and katsu con and cons that have a more this general Public audience do the anime that everyone should see at kinetic con.

583
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:05,720
Speaker 0: We're obviously more people know what anime to see.

584
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:07,308
Speaker 0: All we do is bring up.

585
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:08,614
Speaker 0: These are obscure anime.

586
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:09,699
Speaker 0: You should see we should do now.

587
00:32:09,981 --> 00:32:10,384
Speaker 1: You know what?

588
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:12,580
Speaker 1: We should be really for kinetic on because there are two audiences.

589
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,214
Speaker 1: We do two panels and I don't know what to call them.

590
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:16,460
Speaker 1: one is the anime.

591
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:17,856
Speaker 1: Everyone should see that.

592
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:20,731
Speaker 1: You know all the like super big names that people might just not know.

593
00:32:20,811 --> 00:32:22,719
Speaker 1: I know Ava ask a bebop all those things.

594
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:24,284
Speaker 1: Then we do the other panel.

595
00:32:24,324 --> 00:32:28,617
Speaker 1: That is all the like KO century beast Dominion tank police all that stuff people know.

596
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:29,319
Speaker 0: tank police.

597
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:31,955
Speaker 1: Well people at kinetic on no tank police.

598
00:32:31,995 --> 00:32:33,242
Speaker 1: That's right God.

599
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:35,671
Speaker 1: at the match game someone started singing it.

600
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:38,280
Speaker 1: as soon as someone said Dominion tank police and that you know.

601
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,500
Speaker 0: I'm gonna skip ahead to the con feedback session.

602
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:47,120
Speaker 0: But you know the guy who was sort of the guy who ran the panels and events at Kinetic on was sort of thrown into it the last minute.

603
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:54,014
Speaker 1: Yes This is there were a lot of problems with panels at kinetic on but They really weren't the guy in charge of its fault because it was one of those.

604
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:56,871
Speaker 1: Ah shit the cons fucked You fix it.

605
00:32:56,952 --> 00:32:58,163
Speaker 1: and he said, ah crap Oh.

606
00:32:58,203 --> 00:33:02,931
Speaker 0: and he did the you know As good a job as can be reasonably expected from someone in that position.

607
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:12,700
Speaker 0: and I could tell from listening to him at the feedback Session which he had to handle on his own Right where last year at kinetic on the feedback session was handled by the you know, the entire head staff.

608
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:18,040
Speaker 0: So the end he handled it real well And I could tell that he was the right person for the job and he knew his shit.

609
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much we're gonna be joining the staff along with him next year to handle panels.

610
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,328
Speaker 1: No, yeah, so they can.

611
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:25,200
Speaker 1: kinetic on is gonna be awesome.

612
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,919
Speaker 0: But what he said at the you know feedback panel, which is something I think is very true for kinetic on is that?

613
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,327
Speaker 0: Even though kinetic on is understaffed.

614
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:36,760
Speaker 0: They know that right kinetic on has its problems and you know logistics.

615
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:37,526
Speaker 0: We know that.

616
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:39,360
Speaker 0: you know, there's all these things.

617
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:47,812
Speaker 0: the people the members the people who come to kinetic on are really the people who make it happen and You get so only true.

618
00:33:47,932 --> 00:33:49,462
Speaker 0: you look around the con It's not.

619
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:55,420
Speaker 0: the staff aren't going around making big magic like happens and say katsu khan where they make huge magic.

620
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:56,243
Speaker 0: You know this.

621
00:33:56,424 --> 00:34:00,880
Speaker 0: the there aren't you know, there are big guests, but there aren't tons and tons of huge guests and amazed.

622
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:11,690
Speaker 0: There's no industry presence at all Right, but awesome things are happening and it's all the people who came to the con making it awesome for each other Especially the thing that's so crazy about kinetic on.

623
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,978
Speaker 1: I think I talked about this last year, but it always amazes me.

624
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:18,797
Speaker 1: Every other con I go to Otakon katsu khan, even though his staff and an amazement.

625
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:23,969
Speaker 1: and you know all these There were always like you needed crowd control everywhere.

626
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,580
Speaker 1: You needed people like constantly keeping everyone in line and keeping everything organized.

627
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:34,777
Speaker 1: Basically unless there was like something going on like an event you would really never see a kinetic on staffer.

628
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:38,382
Speaker 1: and yet There were practically zero Problems.

629
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,835
Speaker 1: there were like you didn't need people walking around yelling at people to move and get out of the way.

630
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:44,078
Speaker 1: crowd control was it?

631
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,239
Speaker 1: It's really amazes me that nothing goes crazy at kinetic on for how little security there is.

632
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that says a lot about the people who can.

633
00:34:52,045 --> 00:35:03,513
Speaker 0: I know they need a little help, you know Which I'll believe but you know what as Bad, you know, even though those things might not have been a hundred percent smooth.

634
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,545
Speaker 0: They weren't completely Disastrous they they weren't.

635
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:08,870
Speaker 0: they were you know, okay.

636
00:35:09,212 --> 00:35:10,135
Speaker 0: It wasn't the end of the world.

637
00:35:10,436 --> 00:35:13,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Anime, you should see that was like.

638
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:14,613
Speaker 1: that was crazy.

639
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:16,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't even say much.

640
00:35:16,121 --> 00:35:17,695
Speaker 0: I don't remember what I said during that battle.

641
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:22,120
Speaker 1: and then you know We did the skip a bit cuz I actually I really gotta start packing for Otakon.

642
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm still doing laundry here But you know then we did our how to run an anime club.

643
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,161
Speaker 1: Which?

644
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:27,703
Speaker 1: what do we say?

645
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:30,453
Speaker 1: we we know how to run an anime club like perfectly.

646
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:36,370
Speaker 1: we ran the biggest anime club in the country for a while and This panel is always like super good and the people there.

647
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,555
Speaker 1: They thought this is intently.

648
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:41,420
Speaker 1: they ask intelligent questions We give them the right answers and it's a fun panel to do.

649
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,891
Speaker 0: I was kind of hoping we would get one of those questions.

650
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:44,695
Speaker 0: Like I'm a trucker.

651
00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:47,900
Speaker 0: I want to run anime club But that was so awesome that guy wasn't there.

652
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,562
Speaker 1: So I know.

653
00:35:48,943 --> 00:35:53,138
Speaker 0: but then I'm always looking for that guy dressed up as the guy from Ranma who runs.

654
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:53,700
Speaker 0: what's his name?

655
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, Oh Ryoga.

656
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:57,434
Speaker 1: I thought you had the name of the trucker guy.

657
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:58,820
Speaker 0: No, the trucker was dressed as Ryoga.

658
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,571
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know but I don't remember the truckers name.

659
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,100
Speaker 0: No, I don't remember the truckers name either.

660
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:04,410
Speaker 1: I find a trucker named Ryoga hilarious.

661
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:10,171
Speaker 0: Kineticon trucker Ryoga If you if you listen to this email us geeknightsafrontrecruit.com.

662
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:11,234
Speaker 1: Yes, so.

663
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:22,269
Speaker 1: then we had our Headlining panel beyond Dungeons & Dragons the event that we were running at the penny arcade expo Which the only event we're running in the penny arcade expo.

664
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:33,248
Speaker 1: also the one thing on the schedule most I mean most events We run at conventions are kind of like the show like they're organized and they're good, but they're kind of this back and forth They're kind of ad hoc.

665
00:36:33,268 --> 00:36:39,700
Speaker 1: They're usually like they're really entertaining but they're Beyond Dungeons & Dragons is one of those rare ones kind of like the gecky guy panel.

666
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:50,480
Speaker 1: We ran before where it's a we presented more like a serious lecture and it's a really like we actually put together a polished sort of like We model them as best we can after the TED talks.

667
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:53,391
Speaker 1: We're just insane much because we can't really aspire to that level yet.

668
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:55,760
Speaker 0: No, we're not, you know by that awesome.

669
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,779
Speaker 0: We can't even go to TED let alone speak at it.

670
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,819
Speaker 0: Yes, but you gotta be good enough to go before you good enough to talk.

671
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:15,864
Speaker 1: but this was more like a lecture than a panel and The only thing I want to say is that when we arrived to do this panel And I saw that line going all the way down the freaking hallway for us and as we walked out people were going Oh my god, it's them.

672
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:17,149
Speaker 1: Oh, man, this is gonna be awesome.

673
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,614
Speaker 1: That really meant a lot to me.

674
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:20,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was alright.

675
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:23,572
Speaker 1: Well, I get a much bigger hard-on for attention than you.

676
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:24,013
Speaker 0: Yeah.

677
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:25,258
Speaker 0: I was just like what's up people's.

678
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,523
Speaker 0: let's go you know, it's sort of like, you know, I guess that's it's one thing is I People?

679
00:37:30,604 --> 00:37:39,214
Speaker 0: sometimes they have fans look at their fans like oh man, these people like me Oh man, but it's like I look at fans more is like a posse.

680
00:37:39,414 --> 00:37:40,417
Speaker 0: It's like what's up guys.

681
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:41,300
Speaker 0: Let's go rock the house.

682
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:41,925
Speaker 0: It's not like.

683
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:43,436
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, these people love me.

684
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:46,111
Speaker 0: Oh my god I'm super famous and oh my god, it's like haha.

685
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:47,056
Speaker 0: What's up, dudes?

686
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:47,760
Speaker 0: Let's rock.

687
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:50,275
Speaker 1: But that panel was kind of awesome.

688
00:37:50,295 --> 00:37:55,891
Speaker 1: And then of course Sunday, we got to watch a lot of people playing burning wheel.

689
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,200
Speaker 0: I mean people are playing burning wheel all day Saturday.

690
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,444
Speaker 0: I mean Alex.

691
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:01,547
Speaker 0: he ran the sword.

692
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:03,293
Speaker 0: I think what five or six times he's.

693
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:05,460
Speaker 1: he ran it until he was sick of it.

694
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,000
Speaker 0: He didn't run the lacuna But yeah He was complaining.

695
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:10,079
Speaker 0: You know that he did.

696
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:18,931
Speaker 0: Running the sword and not changing the scenario was getting a little boring to him and I could see that but he kept on doing It to see was basically selling a game.

697
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:20,800
Speaker 0: That was someone else's game.

698
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:31,000
Speaker 0: It's like if rim wrote a book and I went around selling copies of it on my own time And he was doing it awesomely and he never had the same person play twice and he had at least three people in every game.

699
00:38:31,161 --> 00:38:36,300
Speaker 0: So he introduced like 20 to 30 people to burning wheel and they all had an awesome time.

700
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,474
Speaker 0: I ran the sword once, you know, and that was a little bit rough.

701
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:40,679
Speaker 0: He ran it how many times?

702
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:45,920
Speaker 1: One funny thing I noticed is that what we were doing this panel to you know, we're it was just a lecture.

703
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:51,146
Speaker 1: you know anime cons like people always try to like say stuff to you or they raise their hand cuz they want to like interject something.

704
00:38:51,998 --> 00:39:02,680
Speaker 1: and There were a lot of the people in the audience were very clearly hardcore Dungeons & Dragons fans and when we first started a lot like I saw a lot of people like raise their hands when we started talking about D&D and they're like

705
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:04,426
Speaker 0: and

706
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:08,930
Speaker 1: After another five or ten minutes, they all put their hands down.

707
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,280
Speaker 1: I think by the end we converted almost everyone in that room.

708
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:12,484
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know it was.

709
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:17,460
Speaker 0: I was expecting there to be like outcries of you know, people saying ah D&D doesn't suck.

710
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:20,340
Speaker 0: And we weren't really saying the D&D suck.

711
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:29,900
Speaker 0: We were saying the D&D only plays this one kind of game which is crawl in the dungeon fight the monster Which is true and I was expecting you know, the typical fanboy outcry.

712
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:36,991
Speaker 0: but I think we the way we presented ourselves really sent a clear message of This is us talking and you listening time.

713
00:39:37,413 --> 00:39:41,655
Speaker 0: There's no talking during this panel and the questions at the end there were.

714
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:49,007
Speaker 0: you know, I allowed time for like three quick questions or so and none of them really Confronted us in a negative way.

715
00:39:49,127 --> 00:39:52,800
Speaker 0: even better and everyone was smiling and laughing and then cheering and excited.

716
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:58,919
Speaker 1: well, I think part of that was the That picture of the train that made sure the train works real well.

717
00:39:59,582 --> 00:40:01,391
Speaker 1: That picture is just one of my favorite pictures.

718
00:40:01,672 --> 00:40:03,380
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's a good picture.

719
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,480
Speaker 1: It's one of those pictures where if there's a crowd of people you just have to show it to them and I'll start laughing.

720
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:10,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean putting it in context is doubles the power.

721
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,308
Speaker 0: That's that.

722
00:40:12,348 --> 00:40:12,673
Speaker 0: love me.

723
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:20,216
Speaker 1: That's one thing as much of a hardcore anime love and base.

724
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:21,239
Speaker 1: there was a kinetic on.

725
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:26,513
Speaker 1: Only like only two or three people in the audience got that joke until we explained it.

726
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:27,275
Speaker 0: Yeah.

727
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:32,927
Speaker 0: Well, that's a Dragon Warrior joke Dragon Warrior One and you had Dragon Quest.

728
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had to get.

729
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:36,860
Speaker 0: we're talking about slimes and Drake ease.

730
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,071
Speaker 0: It's something else right?

731
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:38,960
Speaker 0: Dragon Quest, right?

732
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,023
Speaker 0: They have rocket slime.

733
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:41,969
Speaker 0: the Drake II gets no love.

734
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:44,337
Speaker 0: the Drake II is far superior to the slime.

735
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:45,159
Speaker 0: Where the fuck is it?

736
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,983
Speaker 0: There's no Drake II game.

737
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:48,066
Speaker 0: What the hell?

738
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:49,631
Speaker 0: I want Drake ease sure.

739
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:50,393
Speaker 1: It's not Drake.

740
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:55,664
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's Drake II dr Iky At least in the translation.

741
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,230
Speaker 0: Anyway, uh-huh.

742
00:40:57,511 --> 00:40:59,377
Speaker 0: I believe anyway, they're so cute.

743
00:40:59,397 --> 00:41:01,363
Speaker 0: They have to have a white the Smile.

744
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:03,671
Speaker 1: I always felt bad about killing monsters in that game.

745
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:09,318
Speaker 0: Well, not until later when they're horrible and disgusting but Early on it's slimes and Drake is yay.

746
00:41:10,562 --> 00:41:13,220
Speaker 1: And of course we spent the rest of the con just hanging out with awesome people.

747
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:15,029
Speaker 1: We met a ton of you.

748

Speaker 0: Yeah, there were no.

750
00:41:18,308 --> 00:41:24,337
