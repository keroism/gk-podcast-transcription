1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,528
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Monday, May 10th.

2
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:12,311
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:18,439
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight We talk about Twitter and then go off on a tangent for a while.

4
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,697
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:29,869
Speaker 0: So I was biking over the the bridge like you do like you do which bridge?

6
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:45,669
Speaker 0: Queensborough Bridge now so the normal bridge and Sunday and There's a lady walking the other direction, and I didn't notice her till I got pretty close Maybe like 10 feet away, and she was fumbling around with something and then she kept walking after she stopped fumbling.

7
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,130
Speaker 1: now That's I've often fumbled with things while I walk.

8
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,846
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll fumbled with my wallet trying to pull the metro card out of there Maybe in the middle of the bridge is like what do you need to fumble with in the middle of the bridge?

9
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:55,710
Speaker 1: sometimes my phone?

10
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,279
Speaker 1: Maybe the phone's ringing you got to answer.

11
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,104
Speaker 0: that I don't know.

12
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:01,538
Speaker 0: but anyway She just stopped fumbling and kept walking.

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:09,270
Speaker 0: so I noticed that near where she was fumbling pretty much the exact spot was Money's like a dollar.

14
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:14,889
Speaker 0: so I pick up the dollar and I bike over and I'm like hey is your dollar?

15
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,261
Speaker 0: and She just keeps walking.

16
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:20,390
Speaker 0: so I think oh Maybe she didn't hear me or notice me because I wasn't right in front of her.

17
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,844
Speaker 0: I was sort of to the side, and I couldn't tell you said it like that straight up.

18
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,370
Speaker 1: Just here's your dollar.

19
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:27,723
Speaker 1: Yeah, as opposed to excuse me miss.

20
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:28,568
Speaker 1: I think you dropped this.

21
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:31,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Maybe she thought yeah I don't know.

22
00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:44,189
Speaker 1: I could foresee if a stranger came up to me And they said here's your dollar I would probably ignore them anyways, then I was like you dropped this dollar do you sure you don't want it back.

23
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:50,306
Speaker 0: and She like she didn't say anything and she had sunglasses on and she wouldn't know.

24
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:51,109
Speaker 0: so I couldn't even like.

25
00:01:51,229 --> 00:02:01,310
Speaker 0: you know It would look like some crazy person was like hiding from the world and she just like you know Eventually, she sort of like stopped and like like, you know coward and I was like what the fuck.

26
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:06,150
Speaker 0: So I'm like all right, I'll just keep your dollar and so I kept her dollar.

27
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:15,302
Speaker 1: You know it's weird because I've run into that too like the the cowering every a couple of times in the last few months I've like I've for whatever reason have to talk to someone in the street.

28
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:25,368
Speaker 1: You know like a situation comes up and When I have talked to certain people they cower like they literally like back And then they like hunt their shoulders down and like avert their eyes from me.

29
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:27,320
Speaker 1: Was that what she did like?

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,429
Speaker 1: back eyes down like it?

31
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:32,490
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell what the eyes were doing but alright cuz of the crazy sunglasses.

32
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, she had like a thing over her head.

33
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:39,821
Speaker 0: She was like, you know, maybe she didn't speak English I don't know, but I was holding out.

34
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:41,510
Speaker 1: at least it's not like beacon.

35
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:51,452
Speaker 1: The last time I interacted with some one of the crazy people on the streets of Beacon Kind of noise Literally, I was.

36
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:52,757
Speaker 1: I was rollerblading and there's a woman.

37
00:02:52,777 --> 00:03:02,067
Speaker 1: she's walking toward me and she kind of looks at me and I smile at Like morning and she hissed at me the most horrifying hiss I've ever heard come out of.

38
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:04,189
Speaker 0: maybe it was someone like us Who was just trying to be silly?

39
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:08,362
Speaker 1: You know, I wish I could believe like I wish that were true.

40
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:10,089
Speaker 1: I wish I expected that.

41
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,174
Speaker 1: I Believe it was a legitimate hiss.

42
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:19,089
Speaker 1: I believe that hiss was intentional and and came from some deep meaning some deep hiss.

43
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:20,657
Speaker 1: There was no meta to it.

44
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,006
Speaker 0: What is up with these people?

45
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:25,350
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't know I didn't run in any crazy people when I was rollerblading over the weekend.

46
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:32,630
Speaker 1: Actually, I roll it is so different rollerblading a long distance in the city compared to like Michigan.

47
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:37,285
Speaker 1: I mean, I went all the way down to Brooklyn through hipster ville Williamsburg across the bridge.

48
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:42,467
Speaker 1: other hipster ville Went through some areas where Hazy's gave me dirty locs, but they didn't throw anything at me.

49
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:45,639
Speaker 0: lucky Yeah, I could have gotten some free tomato.

50
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,044
Speaker 1: I know I was kind of.

51
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:48,690
Speaker 1: I wasn't looking for trouble.

52
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:54,334
Speaker 1: I was just rollerblading around down there and then I go through that neighborhood where there was the bike path and then they took It away.

53
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:56,008
Speaker 1: then the hipsters repainted it.

54
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,363
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but no one threw anything at me, but they gave me dirty looks.

55
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:01,447
Speaker 0: That's what they'll do.

56
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:02,090
Speaker 1: It was the stink.

57
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:03,239
Speaker 0: I stink.

58
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,549
Speaker 0: it's the evil eye.

59
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:05,973
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

60
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:06,535
Speaker 1: was it?

61
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:08,463
Speaker 1: was it the full-on evil eye or just the stink eye?

62
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:09,990
Speaker 1: because there is a difference?

63
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:13,258
Speaker 1: No, I'm pretty sure it was the evil eye.

64
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,589
Speaker 1: Anyway, get the stink eye from like a farmer.

65
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:17,682
Speaker 1: Maybe a gypsy.

66
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:21,728
Speaker 0: Gypsies also have the evil eye and what do you get from?

67
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,068
Speaker 0: Who gives you the lazy eye?

68
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,796
Speaker 1: So we got any news.

69
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,365
Speaker 1: we definitely didn't have a good idea for a show to do today.

70
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:36,289
Speaker 0: no well tonight Well kind of but this is not really news.

71
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:47,777
Speaker 0: But basically this is dude and he made a blog post right and I replied to the blog post like they do and then I got a weird email About my reply to the blog post.

72
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:54,550
Speaker 0: That was really clearly from someone who is just I don't know but Wasn't that the email from me that I forwarded?

73
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:59,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically because someone emailed me about the blog post it stuck in my mind.

74
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:02,269
Speaker 0: Usually you don't remember when you comment on something you just sort of do it.

75
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, but so now I remembered the stupid comments and I remember this post and why not?

76
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:07,970
Speaker 0: Let's discuss the post.

77
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,372
Speaker 1: You know what?

78
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:14,289
Speaker 1: It's interesting cuz with Twitter I kind of just throw stuff out there and then like I don't know a week later I'll randomly just look at my ads.

79
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:19,190
Speaker 1: I see all these people answering and I have no idea what I said that prompted them to respond.

80
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:30,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically this guy makes a long blog post and basically his complaint is that in New York City Right that the technology people are not Entrepreneurially minded right?

81
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,679
Speaker 0: It's like no, but everyone wants to be an employee They don't want to be a co-founder and you're kidding right.

82
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:46,120
Speaker 0: and that he also says that there's all these You know business people out there who are looking who are non-technical and they're looking for technical Co-founders and they can't find them.

83
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,105
Speaker 0: They're really hard to get.

84
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:58,530
Speaker 0: I'm right here right and you know, he goes on to say all this stuff, right and Basically my response to him was all right, dude.

85
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,195
Speaker 0: Well, the response is pretty much.

86
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:02,543
Speaker 0: some are in multiple categories, right?

87
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,690
Speaker 0: The category number one is okay.

88
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:15,670
Speaker 0: so you're some business dude with an idea right and You're looking for a technological person to help you make your idea reality and you don't actually have any money to offer.

89
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,550
Speaker 0: You're just offering equity.

90
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:22,130
Speaker 1: Equity and stock are not how to pay me, right?

91
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:32,303
Speaker 0: Right, so he's like and we had to compete with Wall Street for you know employees here we go after people have What is this?

92
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,717
Speaker 0: To dah dah dah dah and try.

93
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:39,675
Speaker 0: I can't find the exact quote right at this moment But can you paraphrase?

94
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:43,450
Speaker 0: basically he you know, he's like, you know, how come people in New York?

95
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,257
Speaker 0: You can't sway them with.

96
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:46,944
Speaker 0: you know stock and equity.

97
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:48,269
Speaker 0: they don't realize how valuable it is.

98
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:49,738
Speaker 1: I think I can answer that.

99
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:51,370
Speaker 1: I think we can because we have money.

100
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:53,681
Speaker 1: We have money all over the place.

101
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:55,530
Speaker 1: people give us money to do stuff.

102
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,645
Speaker 1: You can't give us not money and expect us to do stuff unless it's something we want to do.

103
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:02,750
Speaker 1: Anyway, plus What is this tech thing?

104
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:10,030
Speaker 1: like what it's just in general because He sounds a lot like the people who email Neil Gaiman and they're like I got a story idea and you want to write it.

105
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:14,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, so here's my post is basically I'm a developer in New York City.

106
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,984
Speaker 0: I would very much like to work at a startup.

107
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:21,726
Speaker 0: if it were the right one I could potentially be very exciting now that the job now I have is bad.

108
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:22,570
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty great.

109
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,102
Speaker 0: However, I think a lot of people here pointed out exactly the problem.

110
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:31,530
Speaker 0: There's pretty much zero percent chance I will risk my livelihood and someone else's dreams.

111
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,970
Speaker 0: I'm not even in the financial sector, but I'm doing alright.

112
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:39,224
Speaker 0: I have rent to pay if you give me equity or stock options.

113
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,950
Speaker 0: There goes rent and groceries.

114
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,917
Speaker 0: That's just not gonna happen.

115
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:43,720
Speaker 0: No way.

116
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:46,049
Speaker 0: I like eating more than I like you.

117
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:54,070
Speaker 1: You know, what's funny is he forgets the very basic thing that people like us Definitely, we definitely want to do that exact thing like that.

118
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,490
Speaker 1: Well, I mean all want to do but we already have ideas.

119
00:07:58,031 --> 00:08:01,019
Speaker 1: We just don't have time or people like him to come into our.

120
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:12,330
Speaker 0: the only thing right that a you know for a tech person The only thing that a business co-founder who is non-technical can offer to a technical person.

121
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:12,932
Speaker 0: Right.

122
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:13,814
Speaker 0: We have ideas.

123
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:15,318
Speaker 0: We also have skills.

124
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:26,890
Speaker 0: The only thing that you can possibly offer us is enough monies Actual monies that we don't have to give back that we aren't like lent monies or capital monies just given monies.

125
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:32,530
Speaker 0: Right that are our monies so that we don't have to work and we can work on our idea all day instead.

126
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,302
Speaker 0: That's the only thing you can possibly offer us right?

127
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:37,350
Speaker 0: You'd be like, oh, I'll give you some equity.

128
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,196
Speaker 0: It's like I have an idea.

129
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:40,520
Speaker 0: Would you like equity in it?

130
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,129
Speaker 0: Sure, you know do this work for me for nothing.

131
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:44,516
Speaker 0: go Be my guest.

132
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:45,602
Speaker 0: I have a million ideas.

133
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:46,789
Speaker 0: I'll give you equity in all of them.

134
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:48,807
Speaker 0: Let's go.

135
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:50,314
Speaker 0: You know it.

136
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:56,055
Speaker 0: we want actual monies and apparently like the people elsewhere right, apparently it's easy

137
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:56,115
Speaker 1: to

138
00:08:56,617 --> 00:09:13,298
Speaker 0: find people in San Francisco or wherever else to do this and I Guess those people are just more free-spirited or risk-taking or the cost of living is lower or I don't know what's up with those people and why they're willing to do it, but Maybe I think just New York people aren't stupid.

139
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,265
Speaker 0: Maybe we don't work for no money.

140
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:26,470
Speaker 0: You got to pay Huh, but yeah, it's a you know, I think that there's like this whole Entrepreneurial thing that's sort of gotten really tied in with tech things.

141
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,250
Speaker 0: Like if you read any sort of tech stuff, you know hacker news or whatever.

142
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:34,490
Speaker 0: Like half the stuff is like entrepreneurial stuff and half of it is tech stuff.

143
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,130
Speaker 0: Like there's been like this intermingling that's been going on, right?

144
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,079
Speaker 1: Well, I mean look at the whole.

145
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,150
Speaker 1: the original tech boom.

146
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,808
Speaker 1: You know the one that we avoided the following bust by going into college during.

147
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:44,113
Speaker 1: yeah That was all.

148
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:50,735
Speaker 0: we also avoided our chance to go in on the boom and leave before the bust by being high school during Because we were definitely.

149
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:58,338
Speaker 1: it's sad because I feel like we were at least some of the people who in a boom like that Would have quit the second they stopped paying us.

150
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:01,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much as opposed to working for nothing for any amount of time.

151
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:05,460
Speaker 0: Yep But the you know, this is like this.

152
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:14,594
Speaker 0: this intermingling has been going on And I think the fundamental reason that it comes up is because a tech person is a smart person and a smart person Wants to.

153
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:16,881
Speaker 0: you know, they want to be their own boss.

154
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:19,229
Speaker 0: They want to be their own person do what they want to do.

155
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:19,913
Speaker 0: Right.

156
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:21,300
Speaker 0: They don't know what I want.

157
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:36,270
Speaker 0: They don't want to do what someone else wants to do But at the same time they also want to eat more than they want to do their own thing, you know and It seems like there's a lot of these entrepreneurial Venture kind of guys out there.

158
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:40,330
Speaker 1: I would argue that some of these people want to do their own thing more than they want to eat.

159
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:49,116
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is that if they're gonna sacrifice food for doing they're only gonna do if it's their thing Not anyone else exactly.

160
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:49,699
Speaker 0: That's what I said.

161
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,808
Speaker 0: I'll do my own thing and I'll do my own thing with you.

162
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:59,089
Speaker 0: know money I save up and if you want to just give me money, okay, but if you give me not money What what you're not giving me anything?

163
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know but I think that a lot of these people are just sort of Like.

164
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:22,083
Speaker 0: they just sort of misrepresent What intrapreneur isms is about and they sort of like they're scamming a lot of tech people in a lot of ways you know like they get someone's like believe in the dream like we can work and be awesome all day and not have to work For the man and basically I'll pay you nothing and it's

165
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:23,970
Speaker 1: really easy to get those people straight.

166
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:29,050
Speaker 0: And then there's pretty much a one out of a hundred chance that will actually get anywhere.

167
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:32,948
Speaker 0: There's a one out of a ten million chance that will become Facebook or Google.

168
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:36,715
Speaker 0: see if so Buy some lottery tickets.

169
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:43,640
Speaker 1: kid if someone had approached me with something like that like right as I was about to graduate from our IT I probably would have been like hells.

170
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's do it.

171
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:51,418
Speaker 1: Yeah work for my parents Can approach me after our IT and said here's money Yeah, and I said thanks for the money.

172
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,247
Speaker 1: I will do things in return for it.

173
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,340
Speaker 0: Yep So here I am now, you know, it's like.

174
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:05,770
Speaker 0: at the same time, you know with these intrapreneurs I share the common desire to you know, be your own person own your own company do your own thing.

175
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:10,506
Speaker 0: You know work from home work how you want to work not work the way the man wants you to work.

176
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,227
Speaker 0: a nine-to-five behind a desk in a cube.

177
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,502
Speaker 0: But I have rent and I like to eat.

178
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:19,734
Speaker 0: and unless you give me money Go home.

179
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:24,326
Speaker 0: I will admit I think you want to be an intrapreneur my and you need tech people.

180
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:35,977
Speaker 0: my suggestion to you Get like a hundred thousand dollars Find a tech person give them the entire hundred thousand dollars all at once and that person will probably Just work for you for one or two years

181
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:36,880
Speaker 1: or disappear

182
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:38,184
Speaker 0: or disappear

183
00:12:38,264 --> 00:12:40,070
Speaker 1: or in five years say yeah, it didn't work.

184
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,736
Speaker 1: I need another hundred thousand dollars.

185
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:42,539
Speaker 1: That's fine.

186
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,420
Speaker 0: But you know, the point is they'd give them money Enough that they won't do it, you know And then they will do the thing that you want them to do.

187
00:12:50,024 --> 00:13:04,624
Speaker 0: or if you think you know If you're just a business person, right and you having trouble because all the good tech people only want to work on their own ideas Just give the tech person the money and let them do their own idea and they'll give you all the equity you want because that ain't worth shit.

188
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:08,761
Speaker 0: On the off chance that it actually, you know makes money you.

189
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:11,430
Speaker 0: basically all you did was give some guy money.

190
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:12,679
Speaker 0: You didn't have to do any work.

191
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:21,020
Speaker 0: and if it works out Your bank and you know what with the current with the sit with the scenario that they want to do in the first place It would be the same thing.

192
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:22,450
Speaker 0: So what's the difference?

193
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:32,967
Speaker 1: Right, you know what is interesting is back when we lived in Beacon and then when I was thinking about buying that house or if I'd bought the house up there I would have been much more able and willing to do some sort of.

194
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:37,030
Speaker 1: you know Stop working for the man and just do like geek nights or something like that.

195
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,270
Speaker 0: I wasn't willing to do it any differently, you know in terms of not having money to eat.

196
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:43,293
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm saying like.

197
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:58,028
Speaker 1: I was much more able to do that because my substantial savings and everything together I could go for a while without a job if I wanted to or with only a part-time job Mm-hmm, but by choosing to move into the city instead, I mean living in New York.

198
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:11,490
Speaker 1: We lead a very luxurious lifestyle Which cost a lot of money to maintain and like the the baseline money I need to maintain my comfortable lifestyle is much much higher now, but here's what I understand right in San Francisco ain't cheap, right?

199
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,330
Speaker 0: It's not like you can live there for ten bucks.

200
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:18,330
Speaker 1: I think a lot of the people who do this stuff live outside in the burbs and commute in work.

201
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,675
Speaker 0: It's that's even less cheap.

202
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,661
Speaker 0: This is the burbs in Silicon Valley are mad.

203
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:22,986
Speaker 0: money's further out.

204
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:24,090
Speaker 0: how far out.

205
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,699
Speaker 0: I didn't even know the geography that far.

206
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:33,090
Speaker 0: I imagine telecommuting and what you know These people like living and how much are they paying for rent that they're willing to work for equity and not money.

207
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:37,201
Speaker 1: How many of them are there really who aren't just trust fund babies?

208
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:38,404
Speaker 0: That's true.

209
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:38,966
Speaker 0: And how many?

210
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:40,069
Speaker 0: how skilled are they?

211
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,569
Speaker 1: Yeah Mmm, I mean New York kind of choose.

212
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:45,355
Speaker 0: you Understand the mentality of these people.

213
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:50,168
Speaker 0: are they just being scammed by these venture people or are they just really?

214
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:50,790
Speaker 0: I don't know?

215
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:52,036
Speaker 0: Do they not care about eating?

216
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:54,670
Speaker 0: are they willing to live in squalor in a slum or something?

217
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,850
Speaker 1: A lot of people who have succeeded were willing to live in squalor.

218
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,356
Speaker 1: That is one option to success.

219
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:14,275
Speaker 1: if we lived in Beacon in squalor like Like ramen for dinner all the time and never eating that already and not going to conventions you'll be dead already maybe or fat To dead and fat.

220
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:15,980
Speaker 1: I mean look the dwarf fortress guy.

221
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,050
Speaker 1: He lives off of the poultry donations from dwarf fortress.

222
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:21,419
Speaker 0: I don't think you're that paltry, but I don't think they're.

223
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:24,350
Speaker 1: I don't think they maintain the lifestyle that we demand these days.

224
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,669
Speaker 1: Well, he also lives where the cost of living is much lower, which is one thing you do beacon real cheap to live in.

225
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:35,468
Speaker 1: We could even live even cheaper if we had the mortgage on that five-bedroom house was substantially cheaper than the rent on this place.

226
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:45,045
Speaker 1: Yeah So speaking of upstart venture capital and entrepreneurialism and all that stuff Twitter had a problem and it's a problem.

227
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:46,110
Speaker 1: that's kind of hilarious.

228
00:15:46,952 --> 00:16:00,470
Speaker 1: If anyway, you all miss the boat to have fun with this Apparently, I don't know how long this was the case if you just tweeted accept and then someone's at name in Twitter They followed you and there was nothing they could do about it.

229
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,489
Speaker 1: They could go on follow you but they they were now following you.

230
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:07,243
Speaker 0: I guess that is that how Twitter like worked under the hood is like.

231
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:12,463
Speaker 0: basically it sent tweets and Certain tweets that you would send or maybe like certain SMS.

232
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:14,250
Speaker 0: Maybe it's like an SMS command, right?

233
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,730
Speaker 0: So if you cuz you know you're doing Twitter over SMS, right?

234
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,375
Speaker 0: You have to type in.

235
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:29,383
Speaker 1: you know command you basically to send texts to Twitter and goddamn if I wouldn't have sort of Encrypted hashes and like special command codes and rotating keys and all that stuff.

236
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:38,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, and apparently right so that those commands Just told allowed you to control Twitter by tweeting and so those tweets obviously wouldn't get tweeted But they would tell Twitter to do things.

237
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:47,120
Speaker 1: Well, it's funny because Twitter like they haven't said and they just coded it real shitty Like I don't believe they've said, you know If the problem had always been there or what.

238
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:56,719
Speaker 1: but the accusations I've seen are that one There were shady companies who knew about this and were basically selling followers Uh-huh, because they knew how to do it.

239
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:05,467
Speaker 1: and the other accusation that's much more Interesting, but also much more conspiratorial and I don't believe it because frankly Occam's razor.

240
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:06,530
Speaker 1: It's just coded shittily.

241
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the reason Lee is every coded.

242
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:09,779
Speaker 0: but

243
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:24,363
Speaker 1: what people are alleging which is an interesting idea because it brings up kind of the whole Root issue of Twitter lately is that maybe this is a feature they were building and they screwed up and exposed it to everyone Because there's a lot of talk about monetizing Twitter nowadays.

244
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:29,208
Speaker 1: Well, they have the sponsored tweets Yeah, but sponsored tweets and all that sort of stuff.

245
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:34,224
Speaker 1: I'm the kind of person where the moment, you know There's a bomb that has not yet fallen on Twitter.

246
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:39,710
Speaker 1: the day I'm looking at my timeline and there is a tweet that was not retweeted by anyone.

247
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:43,109
Speaker 1: I know that is in my timeline that I did not follow.

248
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:50,090
Speaker 1: That is basically a nuclear weapon going off in Twitter because that people like me disappear immediately.

249
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:53,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much either that or we write things to figure out where they come from and block them.

250
00:17:54,391 --> 00:18:02,610
Speaker 0: Yep, so I can't imagine how Twitter can ever Understand right if I have a Twitter client, right the Twitter client gets tweets.

251
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:06,001
Speaker 0: It could just not display those tweets in my timeline.

252
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:06,844
Speaker 0: There's nothing they can.

253
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:08,430
Speaker 0: how are they gonna disguise it?

254
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,570
Speaker 1: Well, that's why I don't think this is exactly what's going on.

255
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:22,730
Speaker 1: I mean, I think the way they're gonna monetize in the end is gonna be some some mishmash of Send it selling trending and analytics and selling clients and basically they're gonna do all the stuff that right now.

256
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,998
Speaker 1: You know They built Twitter and it didn't do much like.

257
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:35,070
Speaker 1: it did what it did and that was it and a lot of people made entire businesses just off of Selling all the things that Twitter didn't do by doing it for Twitter like doing analytics.

258
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:38,470
Speaker 1: I think Twitter is just gonna start doing all that on their own a million times better.

259
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's all those people out of business, which is fine Mm-hmm.

260
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:42,962
Speaker 0: That's what Microsoft does right?

261
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:44,330
Speaker 0: They put out something Visual Studio.

262
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:51,198
Speaker 0: So some other company makes a Visual Studio plug-in and then some companies buy the Visual Studio plug-in cuz oh man They need it so bad.

263
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:52,629
Speaker 0: And then what does Microsoft do?

264
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,462
Speaker 0: They include the features of the plug-in in Visual Studio.

265
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,270
Speaker 0: The other company goes out of business, right?

266
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,120
Speaker 0: This is the is how things work in the plug-in market.

267
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,830
Speaker 0: when you build on someone else's platform, right?

268
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:07,390
Speaker 0: There's always the risk of the people who make the platform are just gonna make you redundant and you're gonna be screwed.

269
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:09,930
Speaker 0: Which is why you don't want to build on someone else's platform.

270
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:15,346
Speaker 0: You want to build on your own platform or be your own platform or be platform independent, you know, like what?

271
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:16,630
Speaker 0: if you make?

272
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:23,287
Speaker 0: You know a platforming game for the Wii and then the same month Nintendo comes out with a platforming game.

273
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:24,230
Speaker 0: That's better than yours.

274
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,395
Speaker 0: It's like oh fuck me.

275
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're done.

276
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,490
Speaker 1: And the thing is you knew Nintendo existed.

277
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:30,209
Speaker 1: You knew they were capable of it.

278
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:43,259
Speaker 1: You basically said I know there was someone else out there who can do what I'm doing right now a thousand times better and beat Me in every way, but if you made a platforming game For Wii, Xbox, PS3, PC And everything.

279
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,190
Speaker 0: Yep, right, then you'd be alright.

280
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:52,775
Speaker 1: I mean basically I think any company whose business model is based in any way on Twitter that isn't Themselves.

281
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:55,893
Speaker 1: Twitter is fucked Just completely.

282
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,038
Speaker 1: I think that's the whole way of monetization.

283
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:03,669
Speaker 1: So a Little advice to all of you out there who might be working unpaid for one of these things.

284
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:15,120
Speaker 1: It ain't going anywhere but it is interesting because someone on slashdot, you know, they're like this big you know insightful post was The suggestion that you would stop using Twitter because it somehow started.

285
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,544
Speaker 1: introducing spam is laughable.

286
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:18,729
Speaker 1: has spam stopped you from using email?

287
00:20:19,614 --> 00:20:21,262
Speaker 0: It would have if I didn't have a spam filter.

288
00:20:21,423 --> 00:20:22,750
Speaker 1: In fact, I stopped using email.

289
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:24,649
Speaker 1: We all stopped using email at RIT.

290
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,268
Speaker 1: We used IM and we started using email again when Gmail came out and spam disappeared again.

291
00:20:30,288 --> 00:20:32,215
Speaker 1: Yep I mean even alright.

292
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:35,607
Speaker 1: my RIT email address was useless at RIT because I got spammed constantly.

293
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:36,490
Speaker 0: I had spam filter.

294
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,115
Speaker 1: I made Thunderbird.

295
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:39,660
Speaker 1: I didn't use Thunderbird.

296
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,888
Speaker 1: I set one up on my spooler and everything.

297
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,998
Speaker 1: I used Thunderbird Yeah on the the open, not the bags.

298
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:46,663
Speaker 0: Man, who's using Thunderbird these days?

299
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:47,927
Speaker 1: Because you don't need to.

300
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:48,810
Speaker 1: webmail is king.

301
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:51,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, webmail and phone mail, which is basically a webmail on a phone.

302
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,904
Speaker 0: But maybe I should try to set up Thunderbird hook it up to my Gmail.

303
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:55,527
Speaker 0: See what it looks like.

304
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:57,850
Speaker 1: But basically I just.

305
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:06,930
Speaker 1: This Twitter thing is interesting because immediately half the people I see in the internet are freaking out like oh, no They accidentally revealed the stuff they're doing to monetize Twitter.

306
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:10,320
Speaker 1: They're gonna send us spam tweets and there's no way.

307
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:12,627
Speaker 1: there's absolutely no way that would ever happen.

308
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:18,670
Speaker 1: Of course It's fun to speculate what would happen if that did happen because I think here's my timeline.

309
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:22,821
Speaker 1: Zero hour a spam tweet goes to everyone on Twitter.

310
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:29,781
Speaker 1: the next 10 minutes a thousand open-source developers Join in and try to make Laconica not be shitty.

311
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:31,606
Speaker 0: It sucks 15 minutes later.

312
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:32,790
Speaker 1: They all give up on that.

313
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:36,502
Speaker 1: Four days later someone else reveals a whole new thing.

314
00:21:36,602 --> 00:21:47,089
Speaker 1: people just use Google buzz and Facebook and whatever But then someone will jump in and do a whole thing that does basically what Twitter does But they'll cut off the baggage that is you know integrating with SMS.

315
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:50,830
Speaker 1: Scott I were talking about this before the show and you know, I came up with this whole scheme.

316
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:59,320
Speaker 1: I was thinking about what I would do to make Twitter better And I think the best way to do it is to hook in a lot more interesting metadata And it's already doing that but the way I would.

317
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,589
Speaker 1: I mean I came up with a scheme basically just for my.

318
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:24,490
Speaker 1: you know It's a thought exercise for me of how to let that be backward compatible with SMS and my scheme involving multiple SMS's and a protocol for requesting the metadata within the characters set within an SMS worked pretty well, but it increased the I guess SMS message overhead by about 50 to 60 percent You know on average which for people who don't have unlimited text plans fail.

319
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:28,849
Speaker 1: but as Scott pointed out, why don't we just bail on SMS entirely?

320
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:34,169
Speaker 1: and I feel like there is a point in time where someone is gonna be able to do what Twitter does.

321
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:49,743
Speaker 1: and all I would add to make Twitter awesome is drop SMS and let messages be any size and kind of just scale it up by removing those limitations of 144 characters and Let people set their own filters and scales and have some sort of radius.

322
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:55,830
Speaker 1: so you can say like these people are four radius from Me and these people are eight radius for me of like this expanding contracting circle.

323
00:22:56,553 --> 00:23:01,070
Speaker 1: And then you tweet and you say what radius you wanted to go out to so it replaces that whole protected tweet bullshit.

324
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:02,434
Speaker 1: And you can have like.

325
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:16,068
Speaker 1: basically you can separate secretly your real friends from your fake friends from the people who follow you from the internet as a whole and It's already far too complicated for anyone to use the reason Twitter is successful and works in the reason face.

326
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:21,385
Speaker 1: because yes It's brainless exactly, but I want to give you Scott the example of doing.

327
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:23,010
Speaker 0: people can't even use threaded comments.

328
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,619
Speaker 0: That's why flat comments are the king.

329
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:26,470
Speaker 0: so threads are fail here.

330
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:29,497
Speaker 1: Here's here's why this is the awesome thing.

331
00:23:30,018 --> 00:23:31,923
Speaker 1: dig was awesome before.

332
00:23:31,963 --> 00:23:34,569
Speaker 1: it was popular among people who aren't like us.

333
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,110
Speaker 1: Dig was great back.

334
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:45,309
Speaker 1: Then like it was a really great way to find stuff and then when it became popular among the masses because it was so simple It became a Ron Paul shitstorm, and it remains so to this day.

335
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:50,070
Speaker 1: Twitter is the same way because it's so dumb so simple so popular.

336
00:23:50,414 --> 00:23:51,428
Speaker 1: It's just a sea of garbage.

337
00:23:52,011 --> 00:24:04,776
Speaker 1: Imagine if all the geeks had their own Twitter that did everything Twitter dud did and did all the awesome stuff that only geeks would Use but then at the very end of it it had the option of and send whatever I'm doing at this level to Twitter and Pull in.

338
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:06,830
Speaker 1: you know have an API for it to interact with Twitter.

339
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:14,249
Speaker 1: You can still publish to the idiots and get a filtered feed from the idiots But otherwise you have this massively powerful tool that does what buzz should have done.

340
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:16,061
Speaker 0: No, it's not gonna.

341
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:16,889
Speaker 0: It's not gonna work.

342
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:17,592
Speaker 1: Why not?

343
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:25,374
Speaker 0: because people that the power of the tool you're thinking that you know the value of Twitter or Facebook or anything is The technology itself.

344
00:24:25,434 --> 00:24:28,424
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter what features you have as long as people can use it.

345
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:35,131
Speaker 0: the only feature that they can offer The number of people that are signed up and unless you already have people signed up It's it.

346
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:40,470
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter you can have the best possible technology in the universe right for this sort of thing.

347
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,777
Speaker 0: And you figured out everything perfectly.

348
00:24:42,797 --> 00:24:44,383
Speaker 0: and Twitter is mad.

349
00:24:44,423 --> 00:24:47,453
Speaker 0: Twitter is still the same as it was when it was first released Crashing every day.

350
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:49,740
Speaker 0: piece of shit right you put yours up.

351
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:50,985
Speaker 0: Twitter already exists.

352
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,128
Speaker 0: Twitter already has a million people.

353
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:52,610
Speaker 0: you can't win.

354
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,694
Speaker 0: You're zero you can't.

355
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:56,162
Speaker 1: there's no way because there were always things like that.

356
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:58,490
Speaker 1: then Twitter appeared and at first you know only nerds.

357
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:00,097
Speaker 0: Twitter was the first one.

358
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:03,030
Speaker 1: no I'm saying trends of like a bunch of people.

359
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:08,666
Speaker 1: Dig was you know when it came in there was a lot of early adopters there for a long time But it wasn't that big of a community at all.

360
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:16,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, so so you could make something that could succeed that could have enough critical mass to become useful dig wasn't competing with anything.

361
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:21,579
Speaker 1: I Would argue that it was originally competing with things like slash dot.

362
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,226
Speaker 0: not really I mean where there was.

363
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:27,800
Speaker 0: there wasn't any actual Democratic you know news site.

364
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,624
Speaker 0: it was the only one.

365
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:31,596
Speaker 0: well corrosion That's not a news site.

366
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:32,761
Speaker 1: It was an aggregator.

367
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,967
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

368
00:25:33,987 --> 00:25:34,610
Speaker 1: there was a way.

369
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,037
Speaker 1: It was a site for fiction.

370
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,123
Speaker 1: It was not just fiction.

371
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,510
Speaker 1: There was a lot of nonfiction written there.

372
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,921
Speaker 1: Well in fact that was mostly what I read on corrosion, but it was.

373
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:41,865
Speaker 0: it was for writing.

374
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:46,255
Speaker 1: It was not news Yeah, but it was still an From people.

375
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,250
Speaker 0: it was not a huge pile of links every day.

376
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,665
Speaker 0: It was like a. it was like a whole blob of text.

377
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:56,170
Speaker 0: one every few days Had not even close to a dig is it not even remotely in the same category?

378
00:25:56,812 --> 00:25:58,558
Speaker 1: so this is I'm just saying that there's.

379
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:06,183
Speaker 1: I think you're just overly cynical about the possibility of a More powerful thing that does similar things to what Twitter does working you.

380
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:07,647
Speaker 0: you couldn't get it.

381
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:08,610
Speaker 0: You know one would join it.

382
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:09,817
Speaker 0: How are you gonna start it off?

383
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:11,446
Speaker 1: Just do it and see if people come.

384
00:26:11,547 --> 00:26:12,110
Speaker 0: Google did it.

385
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,640
Speaker 1: No one came because Google did it.

386
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,009
Speaker 1: half-assed Lee and shit Lee.

387
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:16,776
Speaker 0: So how it doesn't matter.

388
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:18,965
Speaker 0: there have been plenty of people come off and did it not?

389
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:20,250
Speaker 0: shit Lee and no one uses them.

390
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:22,090
Speaker 0: Who?

391
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:24,076
Speaker 1: Who's done anything like that?

392
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,364
Speaker 0: the giant shit who totally failed?

393
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:27,870
Speaker 1: yeah, Jake it was crappy.

394
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:32,647
Speaker 0: No, Jake who was technologically vastly superior to Twitter in every conceivable fashion, but it did.

395
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,390
Speaker 1: I have a feature.

396
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:40,068
Speaker 1: But for me personally, I mean if you want to argue this that's fine But I have a feature list of things that if they were there I would use even though they only want using it.

397
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:43,398
Speaker 0: All right, that's you all right.

398
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,401
Speaker 0: It's not getting good.

399
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:46,627
Speaker 0: There's no point in using something if no one else is using it.

400
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:49,534
Speaker 0: well basically I'm gonna go you.

401
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:51,483
Speaker 0: oh man this IRC chatroom is so great.

402
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:52,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no one in it.

403
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:56,784
Speaker 0: well But it has all these great features like logging and all it's got.

404
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:58,470
Speaker 1: what about our you know private forum?

405
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:00,198
Speaker 1: No one uses that but our friends and yet.

406
00:27:00,258 --> 00:27:02,630
Speaker 1: It's super useful to us and our friends.

407
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,954
Speaker 0: I actually really don't like that.

408
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:08,248
Speaker 0: everyone uses that and I wish that people would you know use more correct technology like what.

409
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:08,790
Speaker 1: how am I?

410
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,449
Speaker 1: Gonna tell everyone in the group in the entire crew hey, we're having a party on this day.

411
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:22,578
Speaker 1: You can send an email to everybody I don't even have all their email addresses and after people don't read create a Google Calendar event and then invite everybody And no one uses their Google calendars.

412
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:24,104
Speaker 0: That's uh so now you're.

413
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:25,550
Speaker 0: you're agreeing with my point?

414
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:29,130
Speaker 0: Is that the technology that people use it doesn't matter?

415
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:37,289
Speaker 1: Calendar is vastly superior Because the calendar doesn't give me an easy way to post a date and then have a discussion about if that it's good.

416
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:38,614
Speaker 0: it Absolutely does.

417
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:41,183
Speaker 1: now how am I gonna send an invite to everyone and then what?

418
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,910
Speaker 1: we're gonna have an email chain discussion.

419
00:27:43,473 --> 00:27:43,895
Speaker 0: It works.

420
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:46,066
Speaker 1: that's a really kind of shitty way to go about it.

421
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:46,750
Speaker 0: How is it shitty?

422
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,574
Speaker 1: Because it's not one.

423
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:49,621
Speaker 1: It's push instead of pull.

424
00:27:49,661 --> 00:27:51,190
Speaker 1: I can't just go to the forum and check the status.

425
00:27:51,491 --> 00:27:51,772
Speaker 1: It doesn't.

426
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:53,882
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean it email chain.

427
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,524
Speaker 0: You go to your email.

428
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:54,745
Speaker 0: You check.

429
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:55,649
Speaker 0: the status is no different.

430
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:57,772
Speaker 0: I Disagree.

431
00:27:57,813 --> 00:27:58,114
Speaker 1: I think it's.

432
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,489
Speaker 0: you go to the calendar you click on the event you check the status.

433
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:01,992
Speaker 0: What's different?

434
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,623
Speaker 0: there's nothing that's different about it, but my calendar.

435
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,430
Speaker 1: so the status of what in my Google Calendar?

436
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, what status are you talking about?

437
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:10,742
Speaker 1: I'd have to dig read the discussion and see.

438
00:28:10,762 --> 00:28:15,005
Speaker 1: you know what people have said But it's not gonna say like now the events on now the events off.

439
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:19,170
Speaker 1: unless I manually do that It'll be deleted from the calendar or moved or I'm the one who made it.

440
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,849
Speaker 1: So I'm the one who has to do all that manually.

441
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:23,989
Speaker 0: So you had to do the same thing by making a post in a forum.

442
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:25,436
Speaker 0: Yeah but then difference.

443
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:28,573
Speaker 1: but then the discussion is there and People it's.

444
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,262
Speaker 1: I think it's a better space for interacting and deciding what we're gonna actually do.

445
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:38,850
Speaker 0: throw a little poll up the calendar is Technologically vastly superior to just using a flat forum discussion.

446
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:41,790
Speaker 1: I don't think it is sorts of things because I have to shoehorn it right.

447
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,893
Speaker 1: People are.

448
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,899
Speaker 0: I disagree where the people know.

449
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,130
Speaker 1: I disagree with you a hundred percent on that because the calendar does not implement it.

450
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,655
Speaker 1: Very well.

451
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:51,310
Speaker 0: the calendar is implemented fantastic.

452
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:56,879
Speaker 1: So I got to make the calendar thing and then I got to make sure I have an up-to-date List of the email addresses of every single person.

453
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,702
Speaker 1: I want to have any.

454
00:28:57,863 --> 00:28:59,007
Speaker 0: the only reason you don't have this?

455
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:02,503
Speaker 0: because you don't use The contacts even if I because there's no people there.

456
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:03,990
Speaker 0: It's the people had to be there.

457
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,815
Speaker 0: I have everybody.

458
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:08,537
Speaker 0: things work fantastically if people use them But why aren't they working?

459
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:11,090
Speaker 0: because people aren't using that but that doesn't matter.

460
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,538
Speaker 0: But now it's got yours you have.

461
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:13,805
Speaker 0: you need people to use it.

462
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:14,670
Speaker 0: That's all you need Scott.

463
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,359
Speaker 1: So I've got a list of all the contacts.

464
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,184
Speaker 1: then we make a new friend.

465
00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:18,129
Speaker 1: I gotta go update that shit.

466
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:20,122
Speaker 0: You gotta update that shit anyway.

467
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:20,524
Speaker 1: No, I don't.

468
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:21,450
Speaker 1: I just make a forum post.

469
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:22,437
Speaker 1: Everyone's always in there.

470
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:24,128
Speaker 1: anyone new is just automatically in the forum.

471
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:28,447
Speaker 0: What you have to add them to be in the see the secret threads though.

472
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:29,130
Speaker 0: It's the same shit.

473
00:29:29,483 --> 00:29:40,290
Speaker 0: No That's a lot easier to maintain than an email list because people's email addresses change just like Twitter is really much easier than a very Complicated system of radiuses and all this sorts of fancy stuff that you want.

474
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:49,154
Speaker 0: Yeah That's another reason that the easy thing that's brain dead and has the people will always beat the fancy system with all the features That doesn't have the people.

475
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,745
Speaker 1: I think a better way to go about it at least for someone like me.

476
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:54,810
Speaker 1: what I want is You have the brain dead and you have the advanced mode.

477
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,246
Speaker 1: I see cute did that very well back in the day when I am was still new.

478
00:29:57,266 --> 00:30:08,130
Speaker 1: there's a well You know I am and I see cute and what I see cute did is they had basic mode by default Which was brain-dead simple I am and no fancy stuff and everything was real simple.

479
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:15,668
Speaker 1: But if you were smart And you want to do all the crazy stuff and it had a lot of crazy functionality awesome stuff that I am clients today Like what?

480
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,596
Speaker 1: It had one before AOL had it.

481
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:21,323
Speaker 1: it had online offline messaging queued messaging.

482
00:30:21,524 --> 00:30:23,108
Speaker 1: you could schedule messages in and out.

483
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:26,136
Speaker 1: you could be Just email.

484
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:29,164
Speaker 1: it was kind of in between email, and I am.

485
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,390
Speaker 0: what was the only thing different about it was the user interface.

486
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:35,736
Speaker 0: Absolutely no other differences whatsoever Because you could transition.

487
00:30:35,756 --> 00:30:37,903
Speaker 1: you could have an email chain that just becomes a chat.

488
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,070
Speaker 1: you couldn't do that with the old clients easily.

489
00:30:40,911 --> 00:30:41,213
Speaker 0: It does.

490
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:41,976
Speaker 0: it's not any day.

491
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:43,642
Speaker 0: It's just the user interface was different.

492
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:45,430
Speaker 0: Everything was actually just an instant message.

493
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:48,201
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you're just changing the user interface.

494
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,070
Speaker 0: there wasn't actually any advanced functionality.

495
00:30:50,773 --> 00:30:53,683
Speaker 0: It was the same exact functionality provided in a different way.

496
00:30:53,904 --> 00:30:54,968
Speaker 0: You're just looking at it different.

497
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:55,530
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

498
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:57,841
Speaker 0: They put it in a bigger window therefore.

499
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:58,926
Speaker 0: It's an email now.

500
00:30:58,966 --> 00:30:59,890
Speaker 0: It's in a small windows.

501
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:05,187
Speaker 1: They also hid a lot of stuff from the simple users like file transfers and setting up dedicated rooms.

502
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:05,749
Speaker 1: all this stuff.

503
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:07,775
Speaker 0: basically Everyone else has.

504
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:10,709
Speaker 0: it's not nothing AOL didn't have back then.

505
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:16,669
Speaker 0: I had chat rooms before I seek you my chat rooms chat rooms, but that was in AOL.

506
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:20,222
Speaker 0: Yeah, instant messenger was also originally in AOL.

507
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:22,030
Speaker 1: I know and a ICQ was for everyone.

508
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:25,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why you're so adversarial because you're spouting bullshit.

509
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,154
Speaker 0: You get away with that.

510
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:29,020
Speaker 0: you're saying not you're saying things that ain't true.

511
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:34,561
Speaker 0: cuz you're you haven't named a single feature that ICQ Had that nothing else had back then.

512
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,510
Speaker 1: file transfer direct file transfer.

513
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,053
Speaker 0: He had fought.

514
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:38,784
Speaker 0: AOL had file transfer.

515
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:46,255
Speaker 0: before aim It was outside of AOL and when aim went outside of AOL, which was useless to anyone who didn't have AOL It was hidden behind a walled garden.

516
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:50,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, and as when aim was outside of AOL it had file transfer.

517
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:52,830
Speaker 0: Also file transfer was always there.

518
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:54,957
Speaker 0: Name something else.

519
00:31:55,561 --> 00:31:56,165
Speaker 0: you got nothing.

520
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:57,050
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

521
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:03,670
Speaker 0: It's been a long time, but you said ICQ had all these features, but clearly you can't even remember a single one of them.

522
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,595
Speaker 0: All right, I'll go back.

523
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:05,861
Speaker 1: It's been like a decade.

524
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:06,485
Speaker 1: I'll let you go.

525
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:07,530
Speaker 0: Are you making claims?

526
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,414
Speaker 0: You don't even remember.

527
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:09,098
Speaker 0: you're just making shit.

528
00:32:09,118 --> 00:32:11,230
Speaker 1: because they had an advanced mode and a simple mode.

529
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,036
Speaker 1: They hid all the advanced mode.

530
00:32:13,136 --> 00:32:14,260
Speaker 0: All it did was show you all.

531
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,430
Speaker 0: these different menu options didn't actually have any functionality.

532
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:18,770
Speaker 1: Oh, so there's no one else.

533
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:24,390
Speaker 0: Oh my god a whole bunch of menu options appeared that let me set like, you know, my profile in crab.

534
00:32:25,034 --> 00:32:27,290
Speaker 0: It was ICQ did not do anything differently.

535
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:33,483
Speaker 0: It was only had user interface Differences that made it appear and feel as if it was more advanced functionality.

536
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:39,110
Speaker 0: in other in terms of instant messaging It was exactly the same as everything else except it made you use a number.

537
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:44,989
Speaker 0: So it was harder and it made you feel cool when you had a number that only had a few digits in it instead of A whole bunch of digits like everyone else.

538
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,449
Speaker 1: You'll feel really stupid when I pull up the old ICQ client and then look at what was actually in there.

539
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:51,829
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, so much fancy stuff in there.

540
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,201
Speaker 1: What's wrong with the idea of having a simple mode in a complex mode?

541
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:57,550
Speaker 1: Twitter, you know, simple Twitter Just works exactly like current Twitter.

542
00:32:57,932 --> 00:33:00,489
Speaker 1: If you're not in the advanced mode gives you all this extra stuff if you want to use it.

543
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:05,730
Speaker 1: Having multiple groups of friends deciding, you know, this tweet will only go out to these friends But this tweet is public.

544
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:09,386
Speaker 0: The problem with that is that it's inevitably going to cause conflicts.

545
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:14,050
Speaker 0: if you are like Interacting with some simple mode users the it's not gonna work so well.

546
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,415
Speaker 1: There are easy ways around that.

547
00:33:15,656 --> 00:33:22,890
Speaker 0: like give me an example of a problem like you've put all this metadata on something But they don't see metadata because they're in simple mode where it just shows in the post.

548
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:31,722
Speaker 0: Yeah, so now you but you're discussing something that's in the metadata like some attached GPS coordinate photos something something They don't even see it and you're talking about it and they don't.

549
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:32,567
Speaker 0: they totally miss out.

550
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:33,049
Speaker 0: They don't get it.

551
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's like what the fuck is this?

552
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:39,495
Speaker 1: Cuz you're if you're interacting with simple, you know people with a simple client will just hide that all from them And they won't know they won't care.

553
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:42,229
Speaker 0: but it's not hidden because you're discussing it in the part that they do see.

554
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:44,198
Speaker 1: Well, that's just because you're stupid in that case.

555
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:46,730
Speaker 0: But the thing is most of these people are stupid.

556
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I that's what all the users are.

557
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,550
Speaker 0: those same stupid users are the ones that are adding the value to the system.

558
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,535
Speaker 0: That's the reason you're there.

559
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,110
Speaker 1: I don't tweet at or interact with any of those people.

560
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:56,733
Speaker 0: That's you.

561
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:57,818
Speaker 0: I'm saying is that's you.

562
00:33:57,838 --> 00:33:59,446
Speaker 0: we're talking about the success of the system.

563
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:00,190
Speaker 0: Not what rim wants.

564
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think there's a room for a system that caters to people like me.

565
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:03,846
Speaker 1: Yes.

566
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:05,729
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly We'll have one user rim.

567
00:34:06,272 --> 00:34:08,197
Speaker 1: I think more people would use a more powerful.

568
00:34:08,237 --> 00:34:11,810
Speaker 0: Twitter has five users rim and the five people like rim that rim didn't know yet.

569
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:24,090
Speaker 0: Alright, everyone else will actually be getting use out of a system that is much much less technologically capable and is brain dead But is useful because they're actually people on it except it's not useful and I ignore the vast majority of people on Twitter.

570
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:25,161
Speaker 0: It's not useful to you.

571
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:25,667
Speaker 0: But guess what?

572
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,570
Speaker 0: So then why do you just don't use it at all?

573
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:35,266
Speaker 0: don't use anything cuz actually you're either gonna have something that's not useful to you because it's a bunch of brain dead people or Something but there's no one on it.

574
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:35,569
Speaker 1: now.

575
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:41,110
Speaker 1: I used Twitter's useful in very specific situations partly because I have such a very strong filter of information in it.

576
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,014
Speaker 1: I only see tweets.

577
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:45,696
Speaker 1: very small number of people and their people were actually, you know Like at a convention.

578
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:51,230
Speaker 1: the tweets are useful and outside of that I basically just post stuff for the listeners and I really don't read tweets.

579
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:57,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, so why do you want something that's all fancy just so you can read tweets that you don't want to read

580
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:07,229
Speaker 1: Because I would actually start using it to publish information toward other sources of I guess other Data receivers out in my life that I currently don't use Twitter for cuz it's not powerful enough.

581
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:14,229
Speaker 1: How is it not powerful enough Cuz I can't like I can't have my private ring of tweets that goes out to group of people easily like.

582
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:16,640
Speaker 1: Tweet all my friends versus tweet this with the clients.

583
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,770
Speaker 1: I have now I want radii.

584
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:19,555
Speaker 0: Why?

585
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:21,630
Speaker 0: why do you want to keep very shit secret?

586
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,082
Speaker 1: I don't want to give the address of a party out to the listeners.

587
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:28,815
Speaker 1: if we're just gonna go to a party with our friends So why you Twitter's?

588
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:33,782
Speaker 1: that's not Twitter's for yeah, but it'd be useful to have you know Get rid of email and all these things.

589
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:39,666
Speaker 1: just kind of have one Way where I just take a piece of information and toss it in the pipe with simple directions of.

590
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:40,871
Speaker 1: I wanted to go to My.

591
00:35:41,012 --> 00:35:53,258
Speaker 1: I wanted to go to these people maybe my friends Maybe the listeners whoever and it just goes out over all the different pipes and all the different ways To whoever it wants it or should get it based on my initial directives But there's no way.

592
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:59,322
Speaker 0: see the thing is at this point in time There isn't really any reason to even have any restrictions whatsoever.

593
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:05,042
Speaker 0: because okay, I tweet something to just my friends Only and then the friend retweets it another whole world ceases.

594
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:05,464
Speaker 0: What's the point?

595
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:06,308
Speaker 1: That's fine if they do that.

596
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:06,810
Speaker 1: That's trust.

597
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,492
Speaker 1: That's the whole bay.

598
00:36:07,593 --> 00:36:11,146
Speaker 1: all technology all chains of trust fail if you trust someone who might.

599
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,669
Speaker 0: but the thing is you just might as Well make everything go out to the whole world.

600
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,329
Speaker 0: This is why all these people are going crazy like leaving Facebook over privacy.

601
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:18,615
Speaker 0: shit I'm like I fuck.

602
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:20,384
Speaker 0: everything on Facebook should be 100% public.

603
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:21,650
Speaker 0: There should be zero private data.

604
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:24,030
Speaker 0: You know if you want to be private don't type it in anywhere.

605
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:28,582
Speaker 1: Good idea to open up our private forum with all our stuff in there.

606
00:36:28,743 --> 00:36:30,630
Speaker 0: Oh, no, what are people gonna find in there?

607
00:36:30,952 --> 00:36:32,867
Speaker 0: Oh my god, they're playing burning wheel on Saturday.

608
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,034
Speaker 0: Oh shit It.

609
00:36:34,054 --> 00:36:36,849
Speaker 1: you don't think it would be annoying at all for everyone out there to have.

610
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:41,810
Speaker 1: you know All of our phone numbers email addresses, you know, our actual phone numbers are actual email address.

611
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,895
Speaker 0: You didn't want people to find it out.

612
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:43,719
Speaker 0: Why'd you type it in?

613
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,029
Speaker 1: because no one's republishing it.

614
00:36:46,752 --> 00:36:49,545
Speaker 0: What do I care if someone people can know my phone number.

615
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:50,710
Speaker 0: where they can do they're gonna call me.

616
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:51,417
Speaker 1: They might.

617
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:57,170
Speaker 1: I dare them to call me Alright, so you just wanted said why don't you just put your phone number out there on the forum and see what happens?

618
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:02,315
Speaker 0: Alright my phone number is 6 4 6 4 1 6 1 8 9 5. don't call me Why not?

619
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:02,920
Speaker 1: they can call you.

620
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,230
Speaker 1: all you want is not you bother me.

621
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,370
Speaker 0: I'll call the police and you're because you're harassing me.

622
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,945
Speaker 0: It's not legitimate reason to call me.

623
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:10,098
Speaker 1: go ahead It's got basically any reason.

624
00:37:10,118 --> 00:37:12,830
Speaker 1: to call you is legitimate unless they repeatedly call you after you tell them to stop.

625
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,609
Speaker 1: So if a million people call you once per day, there's nothing you can do about that.

626
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:20,142
Speaker 1: I'll just get a new number and then you're gonna publish that number.

627
00:37:20,242 --> 00:37:20,624
Speaker 0: Why not?

628
00:37:21,026 --> 00:37:22,908
Speaker 1: And then the same thing happens You can never use the phone again.

629
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:32,130
Speaker 0: It'll be pretty awesome Because what I'll do is I'll if people have a million people continue to call me day after day after changing my number even Once and they never stop I can turn that into something.

630
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,786
Speaker 0: I'll be like this the calls to Scott and I'll make a whole website about it.

631
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:36,510
Speaker 0: be fucking awesome.

632
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:45,086
Speaker 1: Plus Scott part of the reason that that you know our internal forum our discussions work Is that we don't have outside people just butting in saying stuff that we don't care about.

633
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:46,231
Speaker 1: you know spamming it up I.

634
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:50,650
Speaker 0: this is why I think the forum is the incorrect usage for you know, that sort of thing.

635
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:54,420
Speaker 1: Would you suggest for public discussions just among our friends?

636
00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:58,030
Speaker 0: if it a public discussion it's public among our friends.

637
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,498
Speaker 1: It's private for the rest of the world.

638
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,790
Speaker 1: What would you for, you know small discussion?

639
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,497
Speaker 0: I don't have a reason to keep anything private.

640
00:38:03,577 --> 00:38:06,170
Speaker 0: I would just you know, I would just make everything public.

641
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:07,136
Speaker 0: I don't care.

642
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:09,109
Speaker 1: You really don't think that would be annoying at all.

643
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:15,363
Speaker 1: What would be annoying it, you know, just like random kids on the internet start You know getting in the way of our thread and we're trying to make our characters.

644
00:38:15,664 --> 00:38:20,409
Speaker 1: I just scroll past it All right, so you're gonna scroll past like thousands of posts of penises and all that.

645
00:38:21,152 --> 00:38:23,283
Speaker 0: There aren't even thousands of posts of penises in the regular.

646
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:24,689
Speaker 1: we already don't let people in.

647
00:38:25,151 --> 00:38:26,658
Speaker 1: We already have a very high filter.

648
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:28,265
Speaker 0: I approve everyone who applies.

649
00:38:28,285 --> 00:38:31,761
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless they're spam I don't not, you know, that's not there to keep people out.

650
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:32,304
Speaker 0: I don't like.

651
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:33,530
Speaker 0: it's there to keep out spam.

652
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,309
Speaker 1: So anyway things of the day.

653
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,893
Speaker 0: Oh, man, you're not gonna believe this thing today.

654
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:45,395
Speaker 1: I'm not.

655
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:46,758

658
00:39:00,093 --> 00:39:05,311
Speaker 0: That is a pretty much perfect Bag-end my handcrafted Lord of the Rings dollhouse.

659
00:39:05,331 --> 00:39:06,635
Speaker 1: I saw that on FARC.

660
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:08,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't look at it though.

661
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,706
Speaker 1: Is it actually high quality?

662
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:14,346
Speaker 0: It's pretty much as high quality as it can possibly possibly Imagine we be what scale?

663
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:18,522
Speaker 1: it's dollhouse scale, which there's multiple dollhouse scales I have.

664
00:39:18,582 --> 00:39:19,386
Speaker 0: no I what do you think?

665
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:22,720
Speaker 1: I have a dollhouse expert like is it standard and Western or is it Imperial?

666
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:26,777
Speaker 0: It's like, you know a little tiny shit like little tiny hobbit American freestyle.

667
00:39:26,817 --> 00:39:27,600
Speaker 1: I mean, you're like like.

668
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:35,297
Speaker 1: Actually American freestyle is from penny arcade.

669
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:35,900
Speaker 0: I know.

670
00:39:36,362 --> 00:39:41,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, the point is is that the railroad gauges there's like H gauge and O gauge double Z gauge.

671
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:47,660
Speaker 0: The point is that this list this lady is like a pretty good-looking like, you know, mommy lady right there me with hobbit house.

672
00:39:48,948 --> 00:39:49,559
Speaker 1: Not bad, right.

673
00:39:49,740 --> 00:40:02,366
Speaker 0: So my all I got to say is if like you're 20 something and you're gonna grow up to be that lady call me So, uh I had a couple of things.

674
00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:05,480
Speaker 1: but this was cool because we saw it not that long ago.

675
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,580
Speaker 1: So it was present in the mind some confirmation bias when we were at PAX and anime Boston.

676
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:18,500
Speaker 1: You know We hang out with our friend Steve who works at MIT and when we went to visit him Away these secrets we stopped at the the Kendall t-stop.

677
00:40:19,243 --> 00:40:28,855
Speaker 1: the T is basically Boston's bus subway that's underground and mostly and They had in it this whole huge art exhibit.

678
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:39,558
Speaker 1: That was basically Instruments that you could manipulate from the platform that would then play like notes and do cool stuff and basically annoy all the commuters.

679
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:47,244
Speaker 1: and It was a very old sculpture very intricate that had been broken for some time now and That was cool.

680
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:50,300
Speaker 1: Remember we talked actually to Steve about this and like yeah, it's kind of broken.

681
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:53,419
Speaker 1: We got one to work the the Thunder I think was the one we got to work.

682
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:57,409
Speaker 1: And I remember saying oh, it's sad someone should rebuild that thing.

683
00:40:57,449 --> 00:41:04,135
Speaker 1: and sure enough a bunch of students MIT at the rapid Fabrication lab and all this stuff a rapid prototyping lab.

684
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:05,260
Speaker 0: Oh, that's what we saw that.

685
00:41:05,401 --> 00:41:09,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got together and they're rebuilding all the instruments.

686
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:11,076
Speaker 0: I love that You know.

687
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,551
Speaker 0: That's one thing that constantly bothers me is when you see like ruins of things out and about especially like you go to a science Museum and this exhibit.

688
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:18,159
Speaker 0: that doesn't work.

689
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:18,578
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:27,621
Speaker 1: Or you go to the arcade and there's a game the roller coaster park and you see the abandoned mine ride that a kid died in Wildwood.

691
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:33,964
Speaker 0: there was the the barrel of fun or even like right here you get the Queensborough Bridge and there's the elevator lift that no Longer operate man.

692
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:35,249
Speaker 1: I just want to ride that elevator.

693
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:36,253
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you got all these.

694
00:41:36,273 --> 00:41:38,340
Speaker 0: I hate it when things stop operating.

695
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:40,217
Speaker 0: It's like Rochester subway, right?

696
00:41:40,237 --> 00:41:43,188
Speaker 1: Yeah We explored the Rochester subway at least.

697
00:41:43,308 --> 00:41:49,576
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean if you got something right and you make it It's like you got to keep you know, go to the World's Fair.

698
00:41:49,596 --> 00:41:50,200
Speaker 0: They got all this stuff.

699
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,748
Speaker 0: It just doesn't you know, it's like keep the shit in repair.

700
00:41:53,149 --> 00:41:56,500
Speaker 0: So when someone repairs something that was disrepaired, that's awesome.

701
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,469
Speaker 0: That's like made of wind.

702
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:02,920
Speaker 0: if I was the mayor of New York I would just have a World's Fair just so I could get over the fact that all that shits in disrepair.

703
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:20,245
Speaker 1: Something about how as Dense as our human population is especially in places like New York at the same time how sparse it is that you go Like 20 minutes north in the Bronx and they're like gigantic just abandoned rail yards and abandoned factory Houses all over the place.

704
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:21,008
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

705
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:29,317
Speaker 1: Even in one of the densest and most like the biggest cities in the world There's just abandoned stuff all over the place that we can't even fill this little tiny space.

706
00:42:29,357 --> 00:42:30,380
Speaker 1: We've got yep.

707
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:37,038
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the original point of this show, I guess we'll have to call this how long did we use?

708
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:40,427
Speaker 1: like 44 minutes fuck me.

709
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:42,354
Speaker 1: Maybe we shouldn't even talk about antivirus.

710
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:43,017
Speaker 0: I don't know.

711
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:43,800
Speaker 0: we got to change that.

712
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,987
Speaker 0: We got to redo the opening bit.

713
00:42:45,047 --> 00:42:46,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can redo the opening bit some post-hoc.

714
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:48,384
Speaker 1: Well, it's built.

715
00:42:48,404 --> 00:42:51,633
Speaker 1: We already did redo it Bill and Ted style.

716
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:52,757
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

717
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:53,198
Speaker 0: Yeah.

718
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:57,531
Speaker 1: Yeah So this show was actually about what.

719
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:58,695
Speaker 1: what did we do the show on?

720
00:42:58,796 --> 00:42:59,157
Speaker 0: I don't know.

721
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:07,620
Speaker 0: Is it like Why you can't beat Twitter with fancy features and also why privacy is unnecessary?

722
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,146
Speaker 1: Well, I guess we did that in the news.

723
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:10,010
Speaker 1: We kind of disagreed.

724
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,719
Speaker 1: Scott's got a love line set up.

725
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:11,960
Speaker 1: now.

726
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:16,936
Speaker 1: So call layman Scott if you've got any questions or if you have boobs.

727
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:21,999
Speaker 0: boobs should also call Not if you are a boob, but if you are in possession of them.

728
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:26,580
Speaker 1: Wow, I haven't used the word boob as a pejorative like that in a long time.

729
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:29,491
Speaker 0: You have the you know, the blue-footed boobs also call.

730
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:31,057
Speaker 0: we would like to do some sort of animal show.

731
00:43:31,118 --> 00:43:33,098
Speaker 0: it would be fun You know what?

732
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:39,700
Speaker 1: I think the first half of the show speaks for itself Even though your listeners sadly missed out on the fact that we argued for like another half hour.

733
00:43:40,343 --> 00:43:41,608
Speaker 0: Hey the you stream people got it.

734
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no one else back to be recorded.

735
00:43:43,517 --> 00:43:44,180
Speaker 0: the you stream, right?

736
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:44,621
Speaker 1: I believe.

737
00:43:44,682 --> 00:43:45,666
Speaker 0: so you go to you stream.

738
00:43:45,686 --> 00:43:50,824
Speaker 1: you can watch the record get it there, you know, well right into the meta moment We got a moment.

739
00:43:50,985 --> 00:43:53,534
Speaker 1: We've got a you stream channel that we've started.

740
00:43:53,594 --> 00:43:56,329
Speaker 1: for those of you who don't know or don't pay attention We've started.

741
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:04,501
Speaker 1: kind of whenever we record the show and we think to we turn on a camera and you can kind of watch us record the show live and You get to hear it's really boring Cuz.

742
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:06,470
Speaker 0: all you do is you watch us laying.

743
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:08,780
Speaker 0: you basically look at a picture of us that barely moves.

744
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,322
Speaker 0: Well, it's funny.

745
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:19,519
Speaker 1: You see Scott laying like lounging scratching my couch scratching my feet, you know, I mean well I'm like my whatever's I'm wearing like a sport jacket and I got the mixer and I'm sitting my hair on chair.

746
00:44:20,281 --> 00:44:26,640
Speaker 0: Yep, but I'm facing away from the camera and you basically watch this while you hear the exact same thing you're hearing now.

747
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:34,687
Speaker 1: The only difference is you get to hear things like when we stop like between the first half of the show and the second half Of the show will stop and be like man.

748
00:44:34,727 --> 00:44:35,289
Speaker 1: I gotta go.

749
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,957
Speaker 0: We'll stop and have like a 40-minute discussion.

750
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:41,372
Speaker 1: Yeah Or we'll say yeah, what are we doing the show on?

751
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:42,700
Speaker 1: You know, you'll get some of the pre-show.

752
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,399
Speaker 1: We try to figure out what the show is gonna be about.

753
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,347
Speaker 1: Mmm, get some post show.

754
00:44:46,427 --> 00:44:48,136
Speaker 1: sometimes you see the studio audience.

755
00:44:48,779 --> 00:44:54,340
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, you can actually see the noise gates kicking in and the downward expander kicking in on the compressor.

756
00:44:55,322 --> 00:44:58,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's going in real time there those red flashing things like right down there.

757
00:45:00,561 --> 00:45:03,088
Speaker 0: Okay, Oh Cosmos is still the book.

758
00:45:03,148 --> 00:45:05,720
Speaker 0: I actually bought a copy on Amazon for 65 cents.

759
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:11,003
Speaker 1: I'll be ready isn't here yet, but you know as soon as you finish it or I've read enough of it I'll be ready to go.

760
00:45:11,043 --> 00:45:14,156
Speaker 1: cuz I'm just reading parts that I remembered vaguely as a kid.

761
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:14,839
Speaker 0: far too slowly.

762
00:45:16,442 --> 00:45:19,099
Speaker 1: I'm working on stuff and playing video games.

763
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:22,140
Speaker 0: I'm also playing video games, but I'm also reading and working on stuff.

764
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,915
Speaker 1: I'm also Connecticut's taking up most of my time.

765
00:45:23,935 --> 00:45:24,359
Speaker 1: to be honest.

766
00:45:24,942 --> 00:45:29,500
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, you didn't give me any of the the load to bear because there's no easy way to collaborate.

767
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,704
Speaker 1: I'm actually I can't.

768
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:34,457
Speaker 1: I started writing making a database that I'm gonna use to make collaboration easier.

769
00:45:34,477 --> 00:45:41,120
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, but all that aside I guess we can finish out the show on something fun.

770
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:42,666
Speaker 0: What do you want to finish out on?

771
00:45:43,048 --> 00:45:51,160
Speaker 1: so there was a story on slashdot about Monitors Quattro monitors that added a fourth color pixel in the sub pixel level.

772
00:45:51,642 --> 00:45:58,471
Speaker 0: so instead of just RGB there's like the opposite of the the Nexus one that has green red blue green red blue.

773
00:45:58,551 --> 00:46:01,020
Speaker 0: great, you know the word it does like the double greens.

774
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:01,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, instead.

775
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:03,600
Speaker 0: It's green red blue yellow.

776
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:06,205
Speaker 0: Why is there a yellow?

777
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:08,232
Speaker 1: for because it gives you a wider.

778
00:46:08,273 --> 00:46:19,780
Speaker 1: you can make yellow by using It gives you a wider like spectrum of total possible colors You can show like the RGB that we use in CRT's and LCDs cannot show every possible color.

779
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:33,700
Speaker 1: All right And independent of that our human eyes fail us and there are certain real colors perfect wavelengths That due to the fact that like a blue will like excite a couple of red cones in the eye and stuff like that.

780
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:37,120
Speaker 1: We cannot by default see those colors anyway.

781
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:39,651
Speaker 1: So I found this awesome side.

782
00:46:39,692 --> 00:46:41,019
Speaker 1: This would normally be a thing of the day.

783
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:50,740
Speaker 1: There's a whole bunch of like optical illusions, you know those kinds of sites But all of them illustrate a point as opposed to just being cool and the one that I want to point out.

784
00:46:50,800 --> 00:47:09,988
Speaker 1: I'll just bring this up, you know talk about displays Randomly the eclipse of Mars and if you do this debate this this debate If you do this illusion It basically tires out the red receptors in a portion of your vision and then when you pull your head back You will see a halo around this red ring.

785
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,714
Speaker 1: That is true.

786
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:12,276
Speaker 1: Perfect.

787
00:47:12,316 --> 00:47:12,838
Speaker 1: Cyan.

788
00:47:12,858 --> 00:47:22,148
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm You will see the cyan and it shows it next to a gradient Showing you that this color cannot be displayed by your monitor Even though it should because it's a real color.

789
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,860
Speaker 1: and you will see a color you have probably never seen before.

790
00:47:25,502 --> 00:47:27,807
Speaker 1: It's pretty it's pretty damn cyan.

791
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:30,996
Speaker 0: I must say so what if you know the?

792
00:47:31,357 --> 00:47:34,777
Speaker 0: you just made monitors that were CMYK CMYK.

793
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:40,897
Speaker 1: Well CMYK, I mean that you know, that's the K is the light behind the.

794
00:47:40,937 --> 00:47:45,823
Speaker 1: you know, yeah Yeah, well, there's also, you know Additive versus subtractive.

795
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:46,083
Speaker 1: I don't.

796
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:52,530
Speaker 1: maybe we should do a show physics show on light and pigments because The people cannot just look this up on Wikipedia.

797
00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:52,992
Speaker 1: I don't know.

798
00:47:53,072 --> 00:47:54,177
Speaker 1: I feel course.

799
00:47:54,197 --> 00:47:58,220
Speaker 1: at the same time I don't think a radio show about that is gonna be super enlightening.

800
00:47:58,361 --> 00:48:01,160
Speaker 0: It is kind of anything like if you go to the store by LEDs, right?

801
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,712
Speaker 0: You can get green red blue white LEDs you can.

802
00:48:03,772 --> 00:48:06,585
Speaker 0: I guess you can get purpley ones But yeah, you never.

803
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:08,675
Speaker 0: I don't really see like cyan.

804
00:48:08,735 --> 00:48:09,840
Speaker 0: Well, I guess they have yellow, right?

805
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:10,865
Speaker 1: But what we could talk about?

806
00:48:11,046 --> 00:48:12,473
Speaker 1: you see that a lot in stage lights.

807
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:18,880
Speaker 0: Oh, it's true You'll have the difference right but but those are just white lights with you know translucent filters in front of them.

808
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,603
Speaker 1: Well, that's just.

809
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:21,593
Speaker 1: it's cheaper and easier to make color that way.

810
00:48:22,056 --> 00:48:26,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, really You don't say I think is you know, you think about it, right?

811
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:38,120
Speaker 0: You're actually using a fuck ton more energy with that sort of system because you're making it pretty much every wavelength of light Right with this huge friggin light bulb and then you turn it on then you're getting rid.

812
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,026
Speaker 0: You're turning it on the heat and you remove and most of those Wavelengths of light you're not even using.

813
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:49,566
Speaker 0: if you could make a light that was just the color you wanted like just yellow You would use a lot less energy than a white light with the yellow filter in front of it.

814
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:52,130
Speaker 0: Is that it?

815
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:53,011
Speaker 1: I don't know.

816
00:48:53,072 --> 00:48:53,855
Speaker 1: I had nothing else there.

817
00:48:53,895 --> 00:48:56,927
Speaker 0: Well, but maybe we can save a lot of energy on monitors if we.

818
00:48:56,947 --> 00:49:00,830
Speaker 1: yeah Well, maybe display is too part of the reason I bring that up.

819
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:07,455
Speaker 1: So I remember a lot of discussions in the forum where an unnamed friend of ours bought a bunch of cheap LCDs Compared to the ultra sharp.

820
00:49:07,796 --> 00:49:08,198
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

821
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:15,547
Speaker 0: We explained that this was a bad idea, but even the ultra sharp I mean it can't show every color and it can show 16.7 million colors.

822
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:21,168
Speaker 1: Your eyes just can't see them, but there are more colors than that 16 point whatever million.

823
00:49:21,229 --> 00:49:29,720
Speaker 1: technically They're infinity colors because you can break the way there aren't because quanta the way they're there Discrete wavelengths that you can't be smaller.

824
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,070
Speaker 0: So so what is the smallest possible wavelength?

825
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:40,110
Speaker 1: If I try to even answer that question at all Timo is gonna have the biggest palm to forehead reaction that the world's ever seen.

826
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,398
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, in fact would probably.

827
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:42,990
Speaker 0: are you sure you're not wrong already?

828
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:48,186
Speaker 1: He would probably in fact already cause a further eruption of a hanger hitting him.

829
00:49:48,326 --> 00:49:59,537
Speaker 1: I can't pronounce the name of the But what I'm going to say and I hope I am NOT too wrong is that it probably Is in some way related to Planck's constant.

830
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:01,242
Speaker 1: Okay, because that is isn't?

831
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:03,790
Speaker 1: that's the smallest like distance that makes sense.

832
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:07,020
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is.

833
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,112
Speaker 1: the point is that yeah, they're okay There isn't.

834
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:15,757
Speaker 0: I don't think infinite doesn't matter because even if you have more than 16.7 million colors You can't see more than 16.7 million colors.

835
00:50:15,777 --> 00:50:19,948
Speaker 1: Well, according to this we can't even see like basic colors like cyan perfectly.

836
00:50:20,148 --> 00:50:27,557
Speaker 1: So It raises an interesting question though, because look I the limitation is not Necessarily my brain.

837
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:35,124
Speaker 1: the limitation is the shitty physical nerves I've got that are processing this, you know reflected electron information.

838
00:50:35,184 --> 00:50:36,890
Speaker 0: Oh, we already know that mine are a lot better than yours.

839
00:50:37,831 --> 00:50:40,141
Speaker 1: Uh, I would argue that with my glasses mine is better.

840
00:50:40,523 --> 00:50:41,326
Speaker 1: No, why not?

841
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:42,491
Speaker 1: gives me 20/10 vision The only.

842
00:50:42,511 --> 00:50:44,458
Speaker 0: let's get some eye tests going on.

843
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:45,441
Speaker 0: We'll see who wins.

844
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:46,445
Speaker 1: I actually paid.

845
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:47,890
Speaker 0: that would be a great video game.

846
00:50:48,073 --> 00:50:49,029
Speaker 0: I test battle.

847
00:50:49,473 --> 00:50:50,803
Speaker 1: You'd make that in flash.

848
00:50:50,985 --> 00:50:51,569
Speaker 1: people might cheat.

849
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:53,335
Speaker 0: How you gonna prevent cheating?

850
00:50:53,415 --> 00:50:58,170
Speaker 1: make him use a webcam and then figure out how far away they are and then make the images sized accordingly.

851
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:01,417
Speaker 0: That's an actually interesting problem.

852
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,543
Speaker 0: How would you make a video game?

853
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:03,850
Speaker 0: That is the eye test game?

854
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:04,789
Speaker 1: You know what?

855
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:08,547
Speaker 1: You could do the same thing that that fancy window did where you could have a fake window in your house.

856
00:51:08,628 --> 00:51:11,218
Speaker 1: if you wear a Necklace that tells the window where you are.

857
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:13,265
Speaker 1: It makes a perfect 3d scene outside.

858
00:51:13,286 --> 00:51:17,730
Speaker 0: Oh So basically if you got close to you tried to get close to your TV screen to cheat.

859
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:19,050
Speaker 1: It just makes it get smaller.

860
00:51:19,114 --> 00:51:23,006
Speaker 0: No because what you do is you just put the necklace far on the other side of the room and then walk up to.

861
00:51:23,026 --> 00:51:28,310
Speaker 1: you could Do it with a camera, but then I'll use a cardboard cutout of my face like in three men and a baby.

862
00:51:28,591 --> 00:51:30,959
Speaker 1: Yes, so then you have to do an IR sensor.

863
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:34,189
Speaker 1: then I put a heat pack behind the cardboard cutout of the face.

864
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:41,910
Speaker 0: But it would be actually that might actually be the best solution because the heat pack would not be the right shape of a person.

865
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:49,839
Speaker 0: so if your IR Imaging sense I get my friend to stand in front of the computer while I stand back But it would see that there's two people so it turn off.
