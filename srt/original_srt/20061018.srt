1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,711
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday October 18th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:17,040
Speaker 1: We discussed the brand-new death note anime.

3
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:19,797
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:25,780
Speaker 0: You know we haven't really plugged it much yet, but we are going to be guests at uber con this weekend.

5
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:29,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we'll see exactly what the state of that is.

6
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:31,440
Speaker 0: I am a guest at uber con this weekend.

7
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:33,046
Speaker 0: I don't know about Scott.

8
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:36,420
Speaker 1: yeah uber con seems to have a little problem in there.

9
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:38,144
Speaker 1: I don't know what you call it.

10
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:42,020
Speaker 0: Well the thing is they just they didn't really respond very much to emails.

11
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:44,662
Speaker 1: We need to work on our communication Plus.

12
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:48,920
Speaker 0: uber con wasn't really a high priority for my end because we're only doing one panel there.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:59,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's like I'm going to this con mostly for the stuff that a con goer goes for and not so much of the You know con guest action is going on.

14
00:00:59,875 --> 00:00:59,976
Speaker 0: Yeah.

15
00:00:59,996 --> 00:01:00,156
Speaker 0: Well.

16
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:04,560
Speaker 0: There's some guests I really want to meet and hopefully I'll be able to interview them though that means dragging all the equipment out there.

17
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:07,680
Speaker 1: I definitely feeling like at CITICON.

18
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:15,700
Speaker 1: You know there weren't so many get you know con goers there And but I did have a whole blast you know doing networking and stuff with all the other guests.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,652
Speaker 1: So I'm definitely feeling a strong bit of that.

20
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:26,799
Speaker 1: at uber con like I'll spend a lot of time Chilling with our guests you know meeting people talking it up You know letting him in about the show and all that good stuff.

21
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:31,360
Speaker 1: But also I'm gonna play some games because I need to play some new games some games.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,930
Speaker 0: We'll see how much gaming we actually get to do.

23
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:37,030
Speaker 1: I know I really want to play some games Man, but I'll try to play at least two.

24
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:38,777
Speaker 1: That's my goal if I play two games.

25
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:39,460
Speaker 1: It's a good con.

26
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:41,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we'll be at uber con.

27
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:46,059
Speaker 0: It will not be difficult to find us the people who con is small.

28
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,059
Speaker 0: well It's bigger than CITICON and the people who went to CITICON to see us in numbers of people.

29
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,350
Speaker 1: yes It's bigger than CITICON.

30
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,180
Speaker 1: however in space it takes up.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,941
Speaker 1: It's just one two hallways of one hotel room You know.

32
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:03,220
Speaker 0: so our panel apparently is either going to be in the pool or in a suite upstairs somewhere.

33
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:08,180
Speaker 1: Who knows I'm not really too interested in the panel because they threw all these other people on it.

34
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,124
Speaker 1: And who knows who they are?

35
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:10,431
Speaker 1: we're gonna have to find out.

36
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:11,174
Speaker 0: yeah great.

37
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:12,300
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll cramp our style.

38
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,949
Speaker 0: You know if you don't want to be in the panel.

39
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:14,130
Speaker 0: I'll.

40
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,196
Speaker 0: just I'll do the panel.

41
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:15,920
Speaker 1: I'll be on the panel.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,220
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I don't know how it's gonna go because there might be people cramping our style.

43
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:21,928
Speaker 0: Well there were people with us at CITICON too.

44
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:23,734
Speaker 1: That was a different kind of panel.

45
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:30,712
Speaker 1: Okay anyway Yeah, so uber con, New Jersey this Saturday.

46
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:34,846
Speaker 1: We're not gonna go on Friday and Sunday just because We can't do it.

47
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:35,408
Speaker 1: It's not worth it.

48
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:40,225
Speaker 1: so all day Saturday, New Jersey come see us And play games.

49
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:44,380
Speaker 0: yep, and Scott apparently doesn't like the other guests, so I don't even know the other guests.

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,586
Speaker 1: I didn't say I didn't like them.

51
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:47,114
Speaker 0: You're just like these other guests.

52
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,360
Speaker 0: They're gonna cramp our style.

53
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:49,803
Speaker 1: They're guys.

54
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:50,365
Speaker 1: I don't know.

55
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:50,908
Speaker 1: so it's.

56
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:52,213
Speaker 1: you know it's a gaming con.

57
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:53,880
Speaker 1: odds are at a gaming con.

58
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,855
Speaker 1: It's someone who will cramp the style even though this is a distinct possibility.

59
00:02:57,895 --> 00:02:58,678
Speaker 1: They could be cooled.

60
00:02:58,818 --> 00:02:59,320
Speaker 1: awesome, dude.

61
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:00,940
Speaker 0: See I don't see not ruling it out.

62
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,620
Speaker 0: I don't see why they would be more likely to cramp our style at a gaming con than an anime con.

63
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:06,547
Speaker 1: Come on.

64
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:06,849
Speaker 1: Come on.

65
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:08,300
Speaker 1: What kind of people go to gaming cons?

66
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:15,093
Speaker 1: So the latest Studio Ghibli movie is that one that's directed by Miyazaki's son Goro.

67
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,320
Speaker 1: What's-his-face Goro Miyazaki right?

68
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, same last name.

69
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:20,829
Speaker 1: He's his son could have figured that out.

70
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,414
Speaker 0: not so good a director though.

71
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:22,976
Speaker 0: apparently.

72
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,500
Speaker 1: well who knows about that?

73
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,479
Speaker 0: I haven't seen the movie so I had not heard a single person say much good about it.

74
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:36,822
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's based on this series of books called the tales of Earthsea Which are written by Ursula K Le Guin and I've read them And I got.

75
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:42,380
Speaker 1: I read a lot of her books, and they're really awesome like almost Lord of the Rings awesome.

76
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:47,012
Speaker 1: If you haven't read the Earthsea books I highly recommend you read at least the first three.

77
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:52,020
Speaker 1: the fourth one's still good And I think there's another one that I haven't read that I've got somewhere.

78
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,239
Speaker 0: They're not boring like most of the middle of the Lord of the Rings are they?

79
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:56,655
Speaker 1: No?

80
00:03:58,222 --> 00:03:59,699
Speaker 1: And Lord of the Rings is boring.

81
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:05,580
Speaker 0: I got to admit that much of the second book was tedious and boring and I ended up skipping a big portion of it.

82
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,356
Speaker 1: Well you suck, but Earthsea is not boring at all, and it's super awesome.

83
00:04:09,497 --> 00:04:18,312
Speaker 1: Okay, anyway There was a sci-fi channel miniseries based on Earthsea that really sucked really really sucked.

84
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:37,956
Speaker 1: that came out like in 2004. ish and Sci-fi channel must still has some rights to Earthsea in some way, and they're not going to expire until 2009 as a result if Sci-fi channel continues to be an ass you know or decides to be an ass who knows?

85
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:44,960
Speaker 1: if they decided yet The new Ghibli movie ghetto Sankey might not come out in the u.s.

86
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,125
Speaker 1: Legally until 2009.

87
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:51,600
Speaker 0: you know it's sad to say it, but that doesn't affect me at all.

88
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:56,236
Speaker 1: It doesn't affect me either, and it's just sort of annoying.

89
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:17,600
Speaker 1: like hey this company you know made a live-action TV show based on a book and Even though the person with the book that who wrote the book thinks differently And even though like you know Disney is probably gonna bring this thing over and they're huge You know because some guy made a short live-action miniseries of like four episodes.

90
00:05:17,782 --> 00:05:19,819
Speaker 1: This blockbuster movie can't be.

91
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:22,672
Speaker 0: So what exactly is the situation?

92
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:24,439
Speaker 0: I mean does sci-fi have the rights to u.s.

93
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,307
Speaker 0: Release of a work based on that?

94
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,415
Speaker 0: because the other the movie was made in Japan.

95
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:29,460
Speaker 0: I mean, what's the deal here?

96
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:39,071
Speaker 1: It doesn't exactly say the details because this is a part of an interview in the New York Times About you know okay, so you don't actually know.

97
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:41,900
Speaker 1: all it says is that in it's in the New York Times.

98
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,283
Speaker 1: So it's real and according not doubting that it's real and Ursula K Le Guin said in the New York Times Mr.

99
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:51,355
Speaker 1: Miyazaki's movie won't be shown as long as the sci-fi channel.

100
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:59,485
Speaker 1: people sit on their rights Which they have until 2009 unless they decide to stop being a dog in the manger He tells the New York Times.

101
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:24,188
Speaker 0: well see this is a case kind of like what's happened to a con We talked about a while back that Somebody screwed up and most likely either Ursula K Le Guin or the estate Gave up the rights for the US release of a TV work or something or a movie or some sort of derivative And they gave it away in such a way that prevents other words from coming out meaning They fucked up and now they're stuck with this.

102
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:25,191
Speaker 1: I do remember.

103
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,515
Speaker 1: I'm not a hundred percent sure.

104
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:45,659
Speaker 1: this is just what I remember of when they talked to her when the TV series came out how she thought it sucked and You know when they came to her telling her that they had this idea They wanted to do it And they told her that she would be really involved and they would seek her input And then they never sought her input And they just came out with it without her saying anything about it, and she really didn't like it.

105
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:49,351
Speaker 1: So I have a feeling she must have screwed up something back then.

106
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,840
Speaker 0: who knows what seems to have been fairly often.

107
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:56,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know it's cuz not everyone's a lawyer and this kind of shit can happen to people.

108
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:03,219
Speaker 0: well What you got to do is either hire a lawyer or learn about that stuff or at least read a contract before you sign it.

109
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:06,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, who knows plus a lot of times?

110
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,520
Speaker 1: You know you'll write something and then like some publisher will have the rights and they'll do stuff with it.

111
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:13,786
Speaker 0: That's only if you signed away the right.

112
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:15,911
Speaker 1: yeah who knows it's all crazy.

113
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:19,421
Speaker 0: see a lot of young artists and young writers screw up By.

114
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:27,799
Speaker 0: if they get they'll get a publishing deal offer from some company and in return They have to sign away pretty much all their rights, and then the company just takes it does whatever they want with it.

115
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:32,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I noticed this stuff a lot actually lately with comic book publishers.

116
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:37,200
Speaker 1: You'll notice you'll see stuff like you know Marvel Comics, and then they'll have a separate imprint.

117
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,557
Speaker 1: That's like epic and that is a Marvel comic where the creator still owns the rights of the characters.

118
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:48,868
Speaker 1: if you write a Marvel Comic and you make new characters Marvel owns them, but if you're at an epic comic Which is still published by Marvel.

119
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:50,637
Speaker 1: they don't own it, and they have all.

120
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:50,978
Speaker 1: you know you.

121
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:56,606
Speaker 1: every different publisher also has you know a different way of Compensating and paying.

122
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:59,519
Speaker 1: you know the the creators that make comics for the public.

123
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:06,080
Speaker 0: see I just think the idea of a publisher having any copyright interest in a work is really kind of outmoded in old school.

124
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:07,460
Speaker 1: I agree completely.

125
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:09,392
Speaker 1: What can I say?

126
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:09,818
Speaker 1: yeah?

127
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:18,299
Speaker 0: It's all stupid though speaking of anime and anime related news it being anime day here on geek nights This is this poll.

128
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:22,260
Speaker 0: There's a poll on anime news network a little while ago about you know who's your favorite director?

129
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:23,806
Speaker 0: And it went on for a while.

130
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:24,208
Speaker 0: it ended.

131
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:26,320
Speaker 0: I think sometime last week or early this week.

132
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:39,895
Speaker 0: I don't remember exactly when it ended, but if you might recall at Conventions we were going around asking people if they could name any Director of an anime other than Hayao Miyazaki yep.

133
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:43,217
Speaker 1: Oh, oh you can't say Who's the other one you can't say?

134
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,801
Speaker 1: Hmm, I forget there was another one You're not?

135
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:47,731
Speaker 1: that was too easy that we didn't let people.

136
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:49,400
Speaker 0: I can think of a bunch that are too easy.

137
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway go that's cuz I'm an anime fan.

138
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:52,254
Speaker 1: go on go on.

139
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,684
Speaker 0: so the survey You know they ask people on the internet.

140
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:57,834
Speaker 1: What was your favorite director, but why don't we answer this first?

141
00:08:58,155 --> 00:08:59,720
Speaker 0: you pick my favorite director?

142
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,498
Speaker 0: Sadly and scarily is Ikuhara.

143
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:07,332
Speaker 0: But then again, that's just because you 10 is my favorite show.

144
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:08,999
Speaker 0: I actually really like oshi.

145
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:13,872
Speaker 1: If I had to pick right now like there's a lot of them.

146
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:16,339
Speaker 1: I'd have to say Satoshi khan mr.

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,246
Speaker 1: paranoia agent Tokyo godfathers.

Speaker 0: perfect blue perfect blue.

150
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:30,934
Speaker 0: You know what funny because everyone except Ikuhara that we just mentioned is on the list here near the top.

151
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:32,240
Speaker 1: Ikuhara is not on the list.

152
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:34,230
Speaker 0: He's not anywhere near the top of the list.

153
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:34,672
Speaker 0: good.

154
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:36,300
Speaker 1: He doesn't belong at the top of the list.

155
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,861
Speaker 1: He's a freak.

156
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:38,867
Speaker 0: well number one of course.

157
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:41,574
Speaker 0: He's a far and away Miyazaki number two.

158
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:42,657
Speaker 0: I don't know.

159
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:45,269
Speaker 1: Good God wait.

160
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,040
Speaker 1: What are the percentages and numbers on those?

161
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:53,340
Speaker 0: Oh at Miyazaki was like 20 something percent, and I don't know was right under that with a lot and everyone else was single digits.

162
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:56,065
Speaker 1: Oh wow Where'd Satoshi khan come in?

163
00:09:56,807 --> 00:10:00,598
Speaker 0: Satoshi khan came in one two three four four number four.

164
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:01,320
Speaker 1: four is not so bad.

165
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:02,852
Speaker 0: The list was Miyazaki.

166
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:07,152
Speaker 0: I don't know Watanabe, but what's an abhi?

167
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:08,459
Speaker 1: is the samurai Champloo?

168
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:11,900
Speaker 1: Bob guy says I can see where that comes from there.

169
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,940
Speaker 0: They're allowed to vote, but then Satoshi khan I know and then someone who is not on the list and then oshi and the rest.

170
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:20,996
Speaker 0: I didn't care about because it's the bottom of the list.

171
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:25,065
Speaker 0: whatever I Think I get.

172
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:29,260
Speaker 0: Miyazaki's really the only director that is commonly known by anime fans.

173
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:30,370
Speaker 0: I mean he's really good.

174
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:31,319
Speaker 0: his stuff is great.

175
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,080
Speaker 0: But I think that part of this is this survey was done in America.

176
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:46,457
Speaker 0: It's simply that most anime fans in America have no idea who directs anything, but whenever a Miyazaki film comes out It's always I owe Miyazaki's woman something cool.

177
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:48,324
Speaker 1: Well, I think you know.

178
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:50,312
Speaker 1: it kind of reminds me again of comics.

179
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:55,250
Speaker 1: how when I was a kid in the 90s reading comics I didn't pay attention to who the hell created the comics.

180
00:10:55,732 --> 00:10:56,354
Speaker 1: You know I'd watch.

181
00:10:56,374 --> 00:10:57,720
Speaker 1: I would watch cartoons on TV.

182
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,740
Speaker 1: I didn't know who the hell created the cartoons.

183
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:03,335
Speaker 1: I didn't you know Miyamoto played all the made all the video games of my childhood.

184
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:04,059
Speaker 1: I didn't know his name.

185
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:08,070
Speaker 0: Really, I actually looked at the credits of my Nintendo games I remember seeing.

186
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,523
Speaker 1: I looked at him But I didn't you know.

187
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,411
Speaker 1: none of the names really stuck in my mind.

188
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:13,420
Speaker 1: so it's basically a bunch of Japanese guys.

189
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:14,809
Speaker 0: I noticed that a few.

190
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,016
Speaker 0: nay like I knew who.

191
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:18,560
Speaker 0: uh Umatzu was the guy who made the music.

192
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, I knew about him pretty much right away.

193
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:23,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact.

194
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:26,613
Speaker 0: I imported a CD long before there were mp3 z's,

195
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:40,939
Speaker 1: but it seems that lately you know Not only am I paying more attention to who creates the works of entertainment and art that I consume But it seems like they're becoming more prominent like they're trying to push it more especially with things like video games.

196
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:46,883
Speaker 1: used to be the only person who made video games that you knew about it was John Carmack and Sid Meier.

197
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:53,067
Speaker 1: now all of a sudden you're seeing a lot more Romero Romero Romero He doesn't count.

198
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:53,972
Speaker 1: he's a woman anyway.

199
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,338
Speaker 0: It's a very pretty woman.

200
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,125
Speaker 1: very They're pushing a lot.

201
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:57,326
Speaker 1: you know.

202
00:11:57,346 --> 00:12:04,739
Speaker 1: a lot more game developers are coming out to the forefront a lot more comic creators You want to know why are trying to get their names out there besides just Stan Lee?

203
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:05,824
Speaker 0: Cubby.

204
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:07,241
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty obvious Why.

205
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:17,260
Speaker 0: it's a very good move because anyone who wants their name out there is like this is Usually someone who's good, and they're trying to stand out from the pack of rubbish.

206
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:18,065
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

207
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:19,897
Speaker 0: I mean me is I mean people here?

208
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:25,338
Speaker 0: I owe me a Zaki and movie about the environment and everyone just goes oh, it's me a Zaki.

209
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,362
Speaker 1: Oh my god I got it.

210
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:28,774
Speaker 1: at the next con we go to we're gonna go to the Naruto.

211
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:38,500
Speaker 1: if they were like no No, we're gonna ask them Can you name anyone who worked on the creation of Naruto the director a character designer anything?

212
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,519
Speaker 1: And we're gonna see if they know who makes the Naruto that they enjoy so much.

213
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:44,772
Speaker 1: Because I really don't think they do.

214
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:46,925
Speaker 0: I don't think they care I don't think they carry.

215
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:54,420
Speaker 0: the thing is if you're there if you're really new to a fandom It's not useful to you right away to know who directs stuff.

216
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:02,320
Speaker 0: You always didn't care at all, but once you've seen a bunch of stuff, and you think hey I really like that paranoia agent who's really cool, and I really like that perfect blue.

217
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,492
Speaker 0: And hey wait a minute the same guy did both of those.

218
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:10,026
Speaker 0: oh he also did this thing called Tokyo Godfathers, maybe I should watch that.

219
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,954
Speaker 1: maybe you should cuz it's freaking awesome.

220
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,319
Speaker 0: It is I really liked it.

221
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,925
Speaker 0: It's not my favorite of his works.

222
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,129
Speaker 0: My favorite is still perfect blue.

223
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I don't know paranoid agents pretty damn.

224
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,258
Speaker 0: I heard our agents really good, but I really like perfect blue speaking of which we should talk about perfect blue.

225
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:24,640
Speaker 0: on the show.

226
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,490
Speaker 1: I had to watch it again.

227
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,320
Speaker 1: It's been a lot many years.

228
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,619
Speaker 0: I'll put it in the Netflix cuz I really like that movie a lot freaky ending.

229
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,058
Speaker 0: I Remember our friend Lara wouldn't walk home alone from anime club after we showed it.

230
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:42,960
Speaker 1: now It was funny how the first movie he made was kind of scary But a lot of the other ones he made were light-hearted or just semi weird anyway.

231
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:47,300
Speaker 0: Well, it was scary in that Hitchcock thriller kind of way not in the oh my god boo way.

232
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:51,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really don't like the oh my god boo because I don't think that.

233
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:52,240
Speaker 1: I don't think of that as frightening.

234
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,664
Speaker 1: I think that more of his surprise.

235
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:55,971
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, though granted some movies.

236
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:57,114
Speaker 0: Do that very well.

237
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:58,077
Speaker 1: Hey some movies.

238
00:13:58,117 --> 00:13:59,099
Speaker 1: Do do that very well.

239
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,568
Speaker 0: things of the day.

240
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:16,370
Speaker 1: We got hot things of the day today, yeah, we surprised the hottest things of the day that for weeks I had a serious thing of the day that would spark actual discussion.

241
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:17,774
Speaker 0: But then whatever.

242
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:22,670
Speaker 0: but then I saw my thing of the day and the thing is really I just got to get this out.

243
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:30,468
Speaker 0: I got two things in the day today because Scott, but he called dibs, so I can't reveal it But I totally found the thing of the day and showed it to him.

244
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:34,670
Speaker 1: well I totally just found the thing of the day that you're using ten minutes ago and showed it to you.

245
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:37,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna trade here cuz I got dibs.

246
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:44,309
Speaker 1: therefore Yeah, even though I think that the thing of the day I found as far as superior of course my thing of the day as far as superior to your thing of the day.

247
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,296
Speaker 0: Anyway, Scott's thing of the day.

248
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:49,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, right is now.

249
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,810
Speaker 0: This is actually really good.

250
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:58,050
Speaker 0: You know that old thing where Howard Stern fans the call into something and then as soon as they get live on the air They say baba buoy baba buoy.

251
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:02,090
Speaker 1: Well usually what they do is they make a normal prank call and then they say baba buoy at the end.

252
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,410
Speaker 1: So, you know that it was a Howard Stern prank caller.

253
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but what this is?

254
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:19,230
Speaker 0: it's a whole bunch of videos of people Actually one of the videos of this guy who's kind of famous for calling into c-span all the time with prank jokes Which is people calling into c-span?

255
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,249
Speaker 0: Getting on the air and then saying funny things.

256
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:25,801
Speaker 1: I love the first one because the guy just calls in.

257
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:26,785
Speaker 1: he's like hello my on the air.

258
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:27,247
Speaker 1: Yes.

259
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,710
Speaker 0: Fuck Yeah, what was the guy at ball sack teabagger?

260
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:34,690
Speaker 1: Hello, I am ball sack teabagger now that from Pakistan.

261
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:38,670
Speaker 0: That is my favorite one in the sense that you see the guy on the air.

262
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:44,470
Speaker 0: You know The guy is actually moderating all this and he right away figures out that it's a prank call from the name.

263
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:45,998
Speaker 0: You can see it in his eyes.

264
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:47,224
Speaker 0: He's sitting there thinking.

265
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:48,189
Speaker 0: What do I do?

266
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,933
Speaker 0: But then the guy starts talking.

267
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:55,549
Speaker 0: normally, but he's got his finger sitting on the cutoff button and then he's like Howard Stern's penis clink.

268
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,510
Speaker 0: The Thing is c-span gets pranked a lot.

269
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:07,010
Speaker 0: I don't know if you all realize that but I'd say a Significant percentage of the people who call into c-span are people who want to say the word penis.

270
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:10,930
Speaker 1: I have a feeling that it is also a lot of do want to say the word fuck.

271
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:23,791
Speaker 1: I mean if you have a TV network that's on all the time with barely anyone watching it I mean relatively speaking how many people watch c-span especially at the hours when they have you know free call-ins where they let anyone call In.

272
00:16:24,314 --> 00:16:27,329
Speaker 1: so odds are if you call into the show you're gonna get on the air.

273
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:32,478
Speaker 1: So I think a lot of people, you know The kind of people are up at those hours watching c-span.

274
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,530
Speaker 1: are either people who are really into c-span like maybe a congressman?

275
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:38,413
Speaker 1: No, I'm kidding.

276
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:41,142
Speaker 1: They're watching some freaking porno or something.

277
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:43,610
Speaker 1: They're people who want to make a prank call.

278
00:16:43,972 --> 00:16:47,688
Speaker 1: So if you watch c-span odds are you're gonna see prank calls once a week?

279
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,330
Speaker 0: I'm surprised that the only thing you can think of that a congressman would be doing is watching pornography.

280
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:57,790
Speaker 1: Well, if you look at what this news about congressman lately, I think that's what they're doing.

281
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:02,064
Speaker 0: So because one guy was a I think there's three guys.

282
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:03,830
Speaker 1: There was like two other stories recently.

283
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,329
Speaker 0: Anyway, okay.

284
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:09,118
Speaker 0: So now Scott can give you my thing of the day.

285
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,580
Speaker 1: Yes.

286
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:18,010
Speaker 1: Well, and was the bomb, okay Everyone knows about the old Batman live-action show probably the Adam West the best Batman movie ever made.

287
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:21,684
Speaker 1: It's actually from the movie or is it from just the TV show?

288
00:17:21,784 --> 00:17:23,250
Speaker 0: it's from the movie is it?

289
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,679
Speaker 0: Okay, remember that it starts with the shark repellent.

290
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know but I know the shark repellent movie spoilers.

291
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:30,599
Speaker 0: And then they turn all the diplomats into powder.

292
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,387
Speaker 0: Yep, and there's a bomb at one point.

293
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:34,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay We watched it out of the New Year's party.

294
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:37,610
Speaker 1: I know I don't remember all of it, but I remember the shark repellent.

295
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:44,040
Speaker 1: Anyway, the old Batman TV show with Adam West had a movie and the movie was so hilarious.

296
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:59,440
Speaker 1: Oh my god, and there was a scene in this movie in which Batman is holding a giant bomb a bowling ball candle bomb, you know It Boris Bedenov bomb a big black thing with a with a fuse coming out a kaboom bomb.

297
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,477
Speaker 1: Yes, and he was running down a boardwalk holding this bomb and he's running in a hilarious fashion.

298
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:07,664
Speaker 0: He's holding it over his head He's panicked.

299
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,150
Speaker 0: He's looking for somewhere to get rid of it.

300
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,143
Speaker 1: Like he'll go to he could have just thrown it off the boardwalk Ocean.

301
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:17,023
Speaker 0: he tries he turns and try goes to throw it off the boardwalk and there's like someone down there He tries to throw it.

302
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:19,494
Speaker 0: somewhere else is a bunch of nuns no matter what he does.

303
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:20,760
Speaker 0: He can't get rid of this bomb.

304
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:37,408
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, so many people on the internet have passed around the funny animated gif of Batman running with a bomb which is you know hilarious whenever there's a thread on FARC about terrorism or Batman Batman terrorism.

305
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,900
Speaker 1: Yeah anything like that.

306
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:42,238
Speaker 0: The most recent one I saw was they replaced Batman's face with Muhammad.

307
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:52,580
Speaker 1: So anyway Some guy got the idea to combine this with Mario Brothers 2 aka doki-doki panic.

308
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:57,556
Speaker 1: Mario Brothers 2. some doors in the game can just be opened easily.

309
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:58,719
Speaker 1: You just go up to them and walk in.

310
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:03,796
Speaker 1: Some doors have a lock on them and everyone knows to open a lock.

311
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:04,719
Speaker 1: You need a key.

312
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:11,400
Speaker 1: The keys were all located in you know, relatively secret places usually in jars.

313
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,379
Speaker 1: You would go in the jar and there would be a key there.

314
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:19,678
Speaker 1: It would also be these guys around the key these faces called phantos.

315
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:34,480
Speaker 0: now I would like to describe for you the first time I ever encountered a key in Super Mario Brothers 2 aka doki-doki panic USA Mm-hmm, I go in and I see this key and I see these three masks and I think I wonder what those masks are.

316
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,734
Speaker 0: I immediately stopped caring because there's the key the object of my affection and desire.

317
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:41,888
Speaker 0: I jumped down, you know I'm probably the princess maybe toad.

318
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,528
Speaker 0: I pick it up and One of the mass starts rumbling.

319
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:51,452
Speaker 0: now at this point I defecate The mass flies off the screen.

320
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:52,460
Speaker 0: I think all right.

321
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:53,826
Speaker 0: I wonder was that was all about?

322
00:19:53,886 --> 00:20:04,679
Speaker 0: and then it comes back and it's trying to get me and I've run out of the pipe and it's still trying to get me and no matter where I go It's always there, but if I drop the key it goes away.

323
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:09,420
Speaker 1: But if you pick up the key again beeline for your face, yep.

324
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:14,827
Speaker 1: So it was really crazy in Mario 2 whenever you got a key It was some of the best parts of the game.

325
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,277
Speaker 1: cuz you got that key and then you fucking ran.

326
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:18,858
Speaker 1: Holy shit Did you run for that?

327
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:23,096
Speaker 1: Because that phantos is gonna come and freaking kick your ass.

328
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:24,885
Speaker 1: god damn I can't tell you.

329
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:28,785
Speaker 1: when I was like a little kid playing that game I was scared to shit.

330
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:33,000
Speaker 1: a phantos like I would be like, okay ready grab go go go go go.

331
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would run real quick.

332
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:39,968
Speaker 0: Remember, I remember the one where you early on like I think it's the four of the first times We got a dig all the way down in the sand.

333
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,033
Speaker 0: There's a key at the bottom.

334
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:42,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're digging down.

335
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,243
Speaker 0: You're digging down you like.

336
00:20:43,624 --> 00:20:45,130
Speaker 0: I'll bet there's something down here.

337
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:45,932
Speaker 0: Maybe a boss?

338
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:53,715
Speaker 1: you see that key and you think oh fuck You're at the bottom of this giant giant sand pit and the only way place to go is up.

339
00:20:54,116 --> 00:21:01,440
Speaker 1: and if you didn't pick Luigi You're gonna have a hard time jumping out of there with any speed at all Luigi You want to be towed in that situation?

340
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:08,255
Speaker 1: So it is good because he digs down real quickly But at the same time Luigi can jump real high and get out of there quickly.

341
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,580
Speaker 0: He jumps real slow.

342
00:21:09,661 --> 00:21:11,718
Speaker 0: You'll get up faster if you're anyone else.

343
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:12,757
Speaker 1: You got it.

344
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:17,920
Speaker 1: If you use Luigi he jumps so high that you can jump higher with the same amount of time.

345
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:23,100
Speaker 1: No, because don't do a full Luigi jump where he hangs in the air all stupidly because he jumps so slowly.

346
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:23,829
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

347
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:29,951
Speaker 0: Plus he goes up like Anyway, you don't want to be Luigi unless you're doing a speedrun.

348
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,804
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is is The point anyway?

349
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:41,967
Speaker 1: is my thing of the day is a YTM ND in which they show the picture of you know The animated gif of Batman running with the bomb.

350
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:48,285
Speaker 1: they replaced the bomb with a key and he's being chased by a fantasy Hot damn.

351
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:50,653
Speaker 0: when I saw this on 4chan a week ago.

352
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,600
Speaker 0: Did I not laugh my ass off?

353
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:56,434
Speaker 1: I was also laughing the hysterical and I'm still laughing the hysterical.

354
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,197
Speaker 0: I yelled to Scott.

355
00:21:57,217 --> 00:21:57,900
Speaker 0: you got to see this.

356
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,235
Speaker 0: This is one of the funniest animated gifs I've ever seen and he's all skeptical.

357
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:01,918
Speaker 0: and then he sees it.

358
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:05,065
Speaker 1: It's so awesome.

359
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:09,320
Speaker 1: if you know about Batman, you know about Mario - it's hilarious.

360
00:22:10,323 --> 00:22:12,540
Speaker 0: I'm just trying to think of a way to integrate strokes and all this.

361
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,106
Speaker 1: Batman's got scrotum his utility belt.

362
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:23,717
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe he's running away for a lot with his other pokeballs and Digimon's and Whatever else he's got in there.

363
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:31,820
Speaker 0: So anyway being anime day today We would like to do a preview of a show that I'm sure everyone who is an anime fan has been watching.

364
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,033
Speaker 0: The second episode came out recently the Death Note anime.

365
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:41,230
Speaker 0: Death Note not the live-action not the manga but the anime.

366
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,771
Speaker 1: Yes.

367
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:43,154
Speaker 1: There's a Death Note anime.

368
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:44,177
Speaker 1: It just started.

369
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:47,716
Speaker 1: It's It's alright, I think.

370
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:48,120
Speaker 1: yeah.

371
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,840
Speaker 0: Well, it's directed by a Tetsuro Araki, which you might remember from practically nothing.

372
00:22:53,382 --> 00:23:05,985
Speaker 0: He did some storyboards and unit direction for Galaxy Angel and he did some unit direction for Digicarrot And he directed Otoki Jushi Akazuken, which is a new-ish OAV.

373
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:09,059
Speaker 1: that's kind of lame at least to us.

374
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,190
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is the guy doesn't seem to have a lot of experience.

375
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:20,300
Speaker 0: No, definitely not the most experienced director Though I got to say the Death Note anime has a fairly unique style.

376
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,579
Speaker 0: At least it's something that hasn't been used in high-budget shows before.

377
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:26,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I was.

378
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:32,628
Speaker 1: I was really wondering when that we know when I knew there was gonna be Death Note anime How were they gonna make this animated?

379
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:38,251
Speaker 1: because the manga is a whole lot of just people talking Not even just that half the time.

380
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:39,860
Speaker 0: It's light thinking to himself.

381
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:41,850
Speaker 0: Well, if I do this then he'll do this.

382
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,760
Speaker 0: so I'd better do this, but then he'll do this.

383
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:46,593
Speaker 0: So if I do this and this then he'll do this and then I'll do this.

384
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:47,940
Speaker 0: Oh, but what if blah?

385
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think they've fixed they've handled it pretty well.

386
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Speaker 1: Actually a lot of times where you know light usually would have been thinking to himself and there would be nothing to animate.

387
00:23:58,322 --> 00:24:00,980
Speaker 1: They've had him talking to Ryuk, which makes me very happy.

388
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:02,947
Speaker 0: Let's back up a little bit.

389
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:05,260
Speaker 0: All right, cuz I know a lot of people haven't actually read the manga.

390
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:14,889
Speaker 0: Oh Death Note is a very very very popular manga Incredibly freakin popular about a Death Note.

391
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:21,340
Speaker 0: a high school student finds a notebook that was dropped by a Shinigami a god of the dead into the human world.

392
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:25,959
Speaker 0: He picks it up and it says if you write someone's name in this book They'll die.

393
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:27,625
Speaker 0: You can choose how they die.

394
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,910
Speaker 0: all these other rules.

395
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:35,099
Speaker 0: and he thinks whatever and he takes it home and he ends up Trying it out as a joke and it works.

396
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:47,459
Speaker 0: a normal human being Any if it was a typical anime or manga The character would freak out or throw it away or there'd be some sort of hijinks surrounding it.

397
00:24:48,342 --> 00:24:53,097
Speaker 0: This kid sits there after he realizes what happens and doesn't say oh my god.

398
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:53,398
Speaker 0: What is that?

399
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:54,040
Speaker 0: What have I done?

400
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,129
Speaker 0: He says all right.

401
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:03,640
Speaker 0: He says oh, yeah I'm going to become god of this world and meet out horrible justice unto the wicked.

402
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:08,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though you know, he's the wicked who's just a crazy killer killing everybody.

403
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,220
Speaker 0: well, he starts out with good intentions.

404
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,675
Speaker 0: He basically starts killing anyone who's a criminal.

405
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:17,673
Speaker 0: if you think that's good And at least it's understandable.

406
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:18,880
Speaker 0: He thinks he's doing good.

407
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:29,652
Speaker 0: Yeah then the police go after him and he starts killing them and then he starts killing people who so much has Disrespect him and it just goes on from there.

408
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:30,956
Speaker 0: But you might think all right.

409
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:32,020
Speaker 0: This is just stupid fantasy.

410
00:25:32,902 --> 00:25:42,880
Speaker 0: Well, there's a detective named L who is going after him and I'm not going to ruin anything about how that plays out But you'd think how in there?

411
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:52,620
Speaker 0: how could someone possibly catch someone who can kill by writing names down in a book and L fucking chases him down and It's totally realistic.

412
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:53,979
Speaker 0: That sounds stupid.

413
00:25:54,989 --> 00:26:00,615
Speaker 0: It might sound stupid But the way it goes plays out is perfectly legitimate and could really happen.

414
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:10,298
Speaker 0: aside from the whole Death Note part Yeah, it's straight up how they go after people in the logic is pretty flawless All right, if you think so I think so.

415
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,240
Speaker 0: I mean look that the physical things that they do to try to catch light would have worked if that sort of thing existed.

416
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:18,713
Speaker 1: I guess I think a lot of it.

417
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:23,020
Speaker 1: what it is is they you know The Death Note has certain rules around it.

418
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:30,326
Speaker 1: Like, you know if they would have just said yeah You write someone's name in it and they die that would have left you asking a lot of questions and going Oh, why does he just do this?

419
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:31,271
Speaker 1: Why does he just do that?

420
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:31,893
Speaker 1: Etc etc.

421
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:42,659
Speaker 1: And In the manga they put a lot of the rules of how the Death Note works between the chapters and it really fills in Any sort of plot hole that you can think up.

422
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:50,011
Speaker 1: well See it also creates new plot elements because a lot of those rules, you know Force people to do certain things or act in certain ways.

423
00:26:50,272 --> 00:27:01,256
Speaker 0: Well, that's I mean when I you know, it's realistic It's in the sense that the show is and the show in the manga and everything are Very they really really let you suspend your disbelief easily because everything makes sense.

424
00:27:01,597 --> 00:27:02,600
Speaker 0: Everything is consistent.

425
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:14,051
Speaker 0: You know, there's craft anime where you know, whenever they need something to happen there's just a new plot device or the robot had an extra gun or Oh magic doesn't actually work that way.

426
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:15,539
Speaker 0: if you're on the island of blah blah blah.

427
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:20,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, this show is just straight up a hundred percent self consistent from start to finish.

428
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:21,100
Speaker 1: That is true.

429
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:25,113
Speaker 1: It's it's very self consistent and it's one of the thing you won't you'll never.

430
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:27,381
Speaker 1: it's gonna be real hard for you to go Huh?

431
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:28,466
Speaker 1: Well, why doesn't he do that?

432
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:29,310
Speaker 1: Why doesn't he do that?

433
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,716
Speaker 1: You know, you always have an answer.

434
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:37,999
Speaker 0: you will you'll think well, he could just do this and then maybe a character tries to do that and you find out why it didn't work.

435
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:43,244
Speaker 1: or Oh, I think the differences in other shows as you say Why didn't he do that?

436
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,878
Speaker 1: or you know and then something comes out of nowhere in Death Note.

437
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:47,280
Speaker 1: you ask?

438
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,327
Speaker 1: Why didn't he do that?

439
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:50,120
Speaker 1: and then you think back and you go?

440
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:50,963
Speaker 1: Oh, that's why.

441
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:54,397
Speaker 1: because they already covered it as opposed to then covering it up later.

442
00:27:54,417 --> 00:28:01,330
Speaker 0: Yep I mean, it's a made-up story obviously but it it plays out as in very realistically.

443
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:10,420
Speaker 0: the details that come out early matter later and Any detail is there for a reason and everything happens very very consistently.

444
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:20,686
Speaker 0: So aside from the story, it was an incredibly popular manga that finished in Japan and is approaching completion in the US Yeah, but pretty slow.

445
00:28:20,706 --> 00:28:23,254
Speaker 1: I think it's a little over half done in the US.

446
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:25,762
Speaker 1: I mean, I've got volume 7 I think or maybe 8.

447
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:27,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there's 12 right?

448
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:33,969
Speaker 0: Well 13 there but supposedly the 13th volume is not actually story It's just character stuff.

449
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:35,577
Speaker 1: Well, who knows if they'll even come out with it then?

450
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:37,748
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know how well that would do in the US.

451
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:39,055
Speaker 0: I could see people getting very angry.

452
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:44,120
Speaker 0: unless it came with 12 it could as the like the final end piece or something.

453
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:45,246
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens.

454
00:28:45,447 --> 00:28:47,780
Speaker 0: but the manga was really really really popular really really good.

455
00:28:48,245 --> 00:28:52,268
Speaker 0: the live-action movie No one I know has said anything good about it.

456
00:28:52,368 --> 00:28:55,920
Speaker 0: Emily posted in the forums about the specific faults it had.

457
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,374
Speaker 0: I haven't seen it yet, but I really trust her opinion on this one.

458
00:28:58,515 --> 00:28:59,199
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it.

459
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:05,360
Speaker 1: I haven't seen the FMA movie either, but I'm getting the same vibes From people who have seen those, you know.

460
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,960
Speaker 1: But both movies seem to get the same feeling going on where it's based on a thing that we like.

461
00:29:11,503 --> 00:29:13,800
Speaker 1: Yet it's not really holding up in the movie theater.

462
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:20,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, a quote she used that I think probably describes it very well was that for the mood of the Death Note live-action movie?

463
00:29:20,781 --> 00:29:23,038
Speaker 0: She expected a thunderstorm and got a drizzle.

464
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:26,419
Speaker 0: Oh Pun yeah, but the anime?

465
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,108
Speaker 0: We wondered.

466
00:29:28,128 --> 00:29:29,380
Speaker 0: you know how that Scott talked earlier.

467
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,263
Speaker 0: How are they gonna do this?

468
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:33,595
Speaker 0: because the manga is very guy talking guy talking guy?

469
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:43,368
Speaker 0: Thinking guy thinking and then suddenly an action scene and then another you know thousand pages Scenes of the best freaking parts.

470
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:46,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but you wonder how could they make this interesting as an anime?

471
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it turns out that they actually did a decent job.

472
00:29:51,181 --> 00:30:05,479
Speaker 1: The thing is I get this feeling that if I hadn't already read the manga That it would have I would feel it more when I watch the anime, you know, but because I've read the manga I'm not feeling it so much because I already know what's going down

473
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:05,962
Speaker 0: well.

474
00:30:06,022 --> 00:30:11,525
Speaker 0: instead the feeling I get because I've read the manga is more of a oh Here's when this happens.

475
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:13,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, here's when this hat see.

476
00:30:13,192 --> 00:30:17,168
Speaker 1: the thing is if I didn't read the manga I think I might be getting a oh shit.

477
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:20,440
Speaker 1: Look what happened, which would be more, you know exciting.

478
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:22,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the way this show plays out.

479
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,988
Speaker 0: I think he kills people by writing names in a book.

480
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,736
Speaker 0: now that's exciting in the manga because it doesn't move.

481
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:36,180
Speaker 0: How do you Animate a scene where he is writing names in a book and somehow make that interesting?

482
00:30:36,622 --> 00:30:50,990
Speaker 1: Well, you do a montage of people dying all over the place from heart attacks, you know Where you show like a half transparent picture of him writing names furiously in a book with some rockin music Rockin orchestral music I might add.

483
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,700
Speaker 1: right it fits is what matters.

484
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:58,357
Speaker 0: They managed to make a scene where a dude is writing in a notebook while laughing maniacally.

485
00:30:58,377 --> 00:31:03,313
Speaker 0: one Not cliche or stupid or cheesy and two kind of awesome.

486
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:05,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is pretty cool.

487
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,472
Speaker 1: I mean in the manga you actually see him.

488
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:09,683
Speaker 1: do other stuff, you know Like you'll.

489
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:16,589
Speaker 1: you see him like watching TV find a specific criminal pick them out Talk about why he picked that guy.

490
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:19,160
Speaker 1: and so, you know, that's not gonna work in an anime at all.

491
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,203
Speaker 0: No, it definitely.

492
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:25,380
Speaker 0: it is pretty much as for the first two episodes at least extremely faithful to the manga.

493
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,512
Speaker 0: It is a straight up port.

494
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:28,498
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it is.

495
00:31:29,162 --> 00:31:29,383
Speaker 1: I was.

496
00:31:29,503 --> 00:31:33,380
Speaker 1: I was questioning like, you know at certain points they'd be like, oh are they gonna change something?

497
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,466
Speaker 1: Are they gonna change something?

498
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:37,240
Speaker 1: but no it's it's direct it's exactly what's in the mug.

499
00:31:37,387 --> 00:31:49,060
Speaker 0: Yeah the most they seem to be doing is leaving out really really irrelevant details that you don't really need to know like they show a Couple specific people he killed because those specific people end up mattering later.

500
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:52,159
Speaker 0: But for all the generic people he killed they even bother with it.

501
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,805
Speaker 1: Yeah They took.

502
00:31:53,825 --> 00:32:05,200
Speaker 1: basically if you went through the manga and you picked out the key scenes They put those in the anime and all the stuff in between Gets glossed over and covered in montages and and other sorts of things like that.

503
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:11,225
Speaker 0: Now the one thing that they did differently, but they really had to do it differently was you know How do you set up the scenes?

504
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:14,395
Speaker 0: How do you portray how lights tone of voice?

505
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:15,840
Speaker 0: How do you do these things?

506
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,647
Speaker 0: How does he speak?

507
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:17,779
Speaker 0: What does he what does he say?

508
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:22,196
Speaker 0: How does he say it is they're not gonna follow the dialogue in the manga straight up.

509
00:32:22,236 --> 00:32:23,039
Speaker 0: that wouldn't work at all.

510
00:32:23,482 --> 00:32:31,787
Speaker 1: No, I think they've actually changed it quite a bit Like they have him set calling himself a god and being way crazier way earlier Yeah, but that I think that takes out.

511
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:35,460
Speaker 1: that takes out his decline into being an insane villain.

512
00:32:35,842 --> 00:32:40,566
Speaker 0: Well, see, I don't know because because it's more real time It seems that I can.

513
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:45,462
Speaker 0: the person I got in the manga was that he was always the insane villain and he was just looking For an outlet.

514
00:32:46,004 --> 00:32:56,476
Speaker 0: could be could be because in the second episode not not really gonna spoil anything But a policeman is after him and he's sitting there thinking ha ha ha you can't get me.

515
00:32:56,556 --> 00:32:57,178
Speaker 0: I'm so cool.

516
00:32:57,358 --> 00:32:59,847
Speaker 1: I'm so smart So cool, I'm so smart.

517
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:04,667
Speaker 0: and then the cop he's like, haha, whatever filthy human I'll continue doing what I'm doing.

518
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:10,107
Speaker 0: and then the cop on the TV says Kira is evil what you were doing is evil.

519
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:15,666
Speaker 0: and then you see him twitch and then he just freaks out and immediately writes the dude's name down.

520
00:33:15,949 --> 00:33:24,591
Speaker 0: Yep, and It just shows that the kid really is unbalanced and I think they do a good job of portraying that though They might do it a little more quickly than the manga did.

521
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:26,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's all I really said.

522
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:37,431
Speaker 1: Is that you know in the manga you see a guy, you know It starts out where they kind of a lot of people get tricked into identifying with him a little bit Especially if you know, you're a pro death penalty kind of person.

523
00:33:37,652 --> 00:33:39,800
Speaker 1: you you know, you think that way, you know.

524
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:50,627
Speaker 1: And then they slowly make him more and more evil and it isn't until volume two or three that he's really like whoa, dude Whoa Whoa, all right chill out.

525
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:51,410
Speaker 0: Yeah.

526
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,960
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is they gloss over like in the manga.

527
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:57,260
Speaker 0: He starts killing pretty petty criminals pretty early.

528
00:33:58,144 --> 00:33:59,872
Speaker 0: They just don't make a big deal about it.

529
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:05,156
Speaker 0: They just he just kind of mentioned, you know They mentioned like but purse snatchers being killed blah blah blah.

530
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:12,400
Speaker 1: in the anime They definitely, you know hammered into you that this guy is writing down as many criminal names as possible all the time.

531
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:23,869
Speaker 0: In fact, you know I would actually note that because the in the anime you hear his voice as opposed to just seeing because even early on in the Manga one of the things about this is that light has this characteristic snare.

532
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:31,614
Speaker 0: He has this light look on his face when he does something evil and you get that in the manga pretty much from the start All the way through.

533
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,449
Speaker 0: but now because you have him saying things with it.

534
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:37,768
Speaker 0: It might just be that it seems more evil because now we hear his voice.

535
00:34:38,592 --> 00:34:39,916
Speaker 1: It could be it could be.

536
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:43,387
Speaker 1: the voice acting is definitely highlights the evil pretty well.

537
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:55,310
Speaker 0: now Probably the best character in Death Note is not Elle the awesome dude who's going after him who is Unique and stylized in a way that if you haven't read the manga, I'm not going to ruin.

538
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:57,982
Speaker 0: But and then there's light.

539
00:34:58,023 --> 00:35:00,734
Speaker 1: but Ryuk Ryuk is my man.

540
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:03,342
Speaker 1: Pretty much you can't in Death Note.

541
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:05,670
Speaker 1: It's really hard to root for anyone full-on.

542
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,865
Speaker 1: I mean Elle is cool and the good guy, but he's a little off.

543
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,130
Speaker 0: I don't think he's a little off.

544
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,090
Speaker 0: I think he's adorable.

545
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:13,950
Speaker 1: Like I said, he's a little off.

546
00:35:14,432 --> 00:35:24,430
Speaker 1: So the only one I can really root for is Ryuk who is the Shinigami god of death Because it's not evil if he kills people and you don't even really see him killing people.

547
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,294
Speaker 1: I mean, it's his job.

548
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:28,990
Speaker 1: that would be like rooting against the grim reaper if you're rooted against Ryuk.

549
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:35,550
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean the reason the Death Notes on the planet is that Ryuk a death God was basically bored and wanted to see what would happen.

550
00:35:35,965 --> 00:35:39,742
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean in the in the world of the Shinigami where all the Shinigami hang out.

551
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:45,489
Speaker 1: everyone all the Shinigami are losers and they Sit around gambling and doing nothing all day and they should be killing people.

552
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,837
Speaker 1: So Ryuk says this sucks.

553
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:49,760
Speaker 1: Everyone here sucks.

554
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:52,510
Speaker 1: I'm leaving and Ryuk is also an awesome Shinigami.

555
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,683
Speaker 1: He tricked the the super god of death into giving him two Death Notes.

556
00:35:57,365 --> 00:35:58,950
Speaker 1: So, you know, this guy's up to something.

557
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:04,510
Speaker 1: so he's the only guy I can root for and In the show they do a pretty good job of portraying him.

558
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:11,930
Speaker 1: I mean he's got that nice happy looking smile and he's real he's acting just like he did in the in the manga.

559
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:13,670
Speaker 1: He's eating apples all the time.

560
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:22,170
Speaker 0: Yeah Because one thing that Ryuk provided a lot was in the manga Little bits of comic relief here and there that were really sparse but really really funny.

561
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:29,209
Speaker 1: I mean this guy this guy if he doesn't eat an apple will get turned upside down and inside out and twisty and twisty.

562
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:39,095
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny when that happens, but the one thing I think in the anime about Ryuk though I think his voice actor while good isn't really What I imagined.

563
00:36:39,315 --> 00:36:41,003
Speaker 0: see actually I think it's okay.

564
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:42,730
Speaker 0: the only voice that's okay, it's not bad.

565
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,354
Speaker 0: I think it's great.

566
00:36:43,374 --> 00:36:45,466
Speaker 0: The only voice that didn't really sit with me too.

567
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:46,090
Speaker 0: Well was Al?

568
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,472
Speaker 0: I think it.

569
00:36:46,815 --> 00:36:48,849
Speaker 0: it sounded a little too deep and cool.

570
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:54,552
Speaker 1: I think that because we didn't each actually see much of Al because he only appeared for a little bit at the end of the Second episode.

571
00:36:54,572 --> 00:37:01,383
Speaker 1: I think in episode three when you're he's actually like, you know doing the tennis scene and stuff like that That you know, he's gonna talk like a normal guy.

572
00:37:01,705 --> 00:37:02,932
Speaker 1: We'll see better We'll see.

573
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:07,410
Speaker 0: cuz I know the manga gives you one impression of Al then we meet him you get an entirely different impression.

574
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:14,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's what they're doing Maybe in the animes because we're still at the point of the first impression of Al and not the second impression.

575
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,810
Speaker 0: now There's one thing that the anime did that wasn't really in the manga.

576
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,310
Speaker 0: well Really - they're really minor.

577
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:27,144
Speaker 0: but I think these are the kinds of things that are gonna make the anime stand out and make it Sit a little bit above the rest in terms of manga.

578
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:48,682
Speaker 0: that gets turned into anime And that when Ryuk first appears like he appears and lights writing and light sees him and light freaks out He just freaks out yep, and he falls to the floor and then Ryuk's like blah blah blah and then light gains his composure and he tries with a straight face to say I Knew you'd come.

579
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,941
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Ryuk has this look like whatever dude.

580
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:53,823
Speaker 1: Yeah,

581
00:37:54,726 --> 00:38:07,507
Speaker 0: and then Ryuk is watching him You know writing all these names the death note and he says something along the effect of wow You've been busy and if you pet be pants down and you see that he's written hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of names And it's only been like a day or two.

582
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:18,843
Speaker 1: Yeah, another thing is like they can add a lot more, you know, it's a certain Scenes that the panels in the manga didn't really emphasize so well.

583
00:38:19,244 --> 00:38:27,088
Speaker 1: like when he writes this one guy's name down He writes it real big and real quick diagonally like ah, cuz he's angry, you know.

584
00:38:27,128 --> 00:38:34,393
Speaker 1: and in the manga They just kind of you know, they might have written it that way I don't remember but it's just like one panel with some action lines You know.

585
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:38,849
Speaker 1: and in an anime that you can you can feel it more when you're watching them when you're reading.

586
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:47,152
Speaker 0: now One thing this anime does that is a little bit different from pretty much anything else out there right now is that it uses Panels.

587
00:38:47,493 --> 00:39:01,750
Speaker 0: it uses a lot of these kind of like the initial D American release the tricked-out version where they'll take like a black bar and have one guy's face on one side one guy's face on the other side and they're Panning in opposite directions and then something else pans across.

588
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:06,286
Speaker 1: Yeah that that happened a few times but it wasn't out of control.

589
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:07,270
Speaker 1: Gundam seed style.

590
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:07,828
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing.

591
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:15,677
Speaker 0: This is probably the first time other than the hit me baby one more time anime music video to antenna Where something like that was used?

592
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:18,828
Speaker 0: Well at least well enough to where it didn't annoy me.

593
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:36,739
Speaker 1: It's like I remember back in like my middle school days when you had when the only way you could edit videos the two VCRs and this box that had a few effects built into it and Starwipe yeah star right exactly and Basically any effect in that box was cheesy.

594
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:40,310
Speaker 1: So it was impossible to make a non cheesy movie with that device.

595
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:42,131
Speaker 1: but you know it's.

596
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:56,050
Speaker 1: one of those things that you could do is is stuff like that where you can have you know like half of one tape on the top and half of one of the bottom and kind of move them around a little bit and You know when someone uses those old-school effects, well, it's you know, they're doing something, right?

597
00:39:56,553 --> 00:39:59,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean pretty much the hit me baby one more time.

598
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:06,896
Speaker 0: AMV and death note are some of the only things I've ever seen where that was either put to good use or at least Not put to bad use.

599
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:10,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think really the way you use that poorly is overuse.

600
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:14,306
Speaker 1: You know if you keep doing it and doing it and doing it then it's a problem kind of life.

601
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:20,710
Speaker 0: when Gundam seed Anytime something happened it would cut to every single character in the show who was still alive going.

602
00:40:21,724 --> 00:40:32,402
Speaker 1: Yep They would split the screen into ten pieces with a different face in each piece and split the screen into ten pieces again Then do a full screen on the character who cares the most.

603
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:33,446
Speaker 0: who directed that?

604
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:36,134
Speaker 0: I forget Is I wanted cuz?

605
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:40,567
Speaker 0: I thought oh if I didn't know I would have thought huh, maybe the same guy.

606
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,510
Speaker 1: No, it's not the same.

607
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:41,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

608
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:44,165
Speaker 0: It's totally not because Araki hasn't done much.

609
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:48,017
Speaker 1: Yep anyway Death note anime.

610
00:40:48,138 --> 00:40:49,846
Speaker 1: so far two episodes watch.

611
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,859
Speaker 0: pretty good If you've read the manga, it's worth watching.

612
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,305
Speaker 0: if you haven't read the manga.

613
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,590
Speaker 0: It's worth watching.

614
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:55,951
Speaker 0: Yeah,

615
00:40:56,012 --> 00:41:07,069
Speaker 1: I really want to know what people who haven't read the manga and don't know anything about death note Think about it, you know because I'm coming from you know, the position of already knowing almost everything that's gonna happen,

616
00:41:07,149 --> 00:41:08,433
Speaker 0: you know Yeah, I

617
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:11,310
Speaker 1: mean if you go into a movie and you already know

618
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:14,748
Speaker 0: You don't know everything that happens cuz you don't know how.

619
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:22,090
Speaker 1: the second Everything but I know most and I'm pretty sure the manga might finish before I see the whole anime.

620
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, I ended up reading these spoiler thread because good job.

621
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:29,419
Speaker 0: I figured mr Period wouldn't go in there and Scott wasn't gonna go in there.

622
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:39,390
Speaker 0: and I'll say right now in the manga of death note The only thing that bothers me is that everything comes to a head about halfway through like volume 70 and something crazy happens.

623
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:46,710
Speaker 0: And then after that, it's like the new characters that come in and the new stuff that happens just really didn't interest me at all.

624
00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:54,690
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like there's a season 2 and like I've read up to like the beginning part the few beginning chapters of season 2 of death note.

625
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:57,762
Speaker 1: And it really, you know while it seems good.

626
00:41:57,822 --> 00:42:03,280
Speaker 1: It's better than a lot of other manga out there It doesn't really compare to the first part of the manga.

627
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,343
Speaker 1: That was so awesome.

628
00:42:04,383 --> 00:42:06,048
Speaker 1: So you get you it feels not good.

629
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:11,667
Speaker 0: now I have my thoughts as to how Death Note should have ended or at least how the second season should have progressed.

630
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:19,828
Speaker 0: and I have A thought to the point that if I could get someone to help me draw it I would be all about doing the dreaded fiction the dreaded fan fiction.

631
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:27,801
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, that that is how bad not bad but how Disappointing the second half of Death Note was to that.

632
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,330
Speaker 0: It will drive a man like me to fan fiction.

633
00:42:30,571 --> 00:42:33,061
Speaker 0: Oh god, I think it could have ended better course.

634
00:42:33,122 --> 00:42:34,086
Speaker 0: I haven't read the end.

635
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:37,919
Speaker 0: I just read the spoiler Yeah, and but - I read a bunch.

636
00:42:37,939 --> 00:42:40,488
Speaker 1: the execution of that could be much different than you think but

637
00:42:40,548 --> 00:42:49,272
Speaker 0: regardless of that I read a bunch of you know after the event happens on Scanslations before I stopped and pretty much from that moment on the manga was kind of and I didn't like any of the new Characters.

638
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:53,816
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do have to read a few more chapters of you know The season 2 before.

639
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:56,189
Speaker 1: I think I can you know get a full opinion on it.

640
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:59,130
Speaker 1: But I have read maybe three or four of those chapters.

641
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:06,197
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone who's read the manga disagrees that the second after the first story arc it really Is not as good.

642
00:43:06,277 --> 00:43:10,090
Speaker 1: so it all feels worse than it is I think because it's not as good.

643
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:17,512
Speaker 1: It's like if you make the most amazing manga in the world like a 10 star manga and then halfway through it becomes a 9 star Manga.

644
00:43:17,793 --> 00:43:21,688
Speaker 1: that 9 star part is gonna feel like a 5 star because they're used to 10 star.

645
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:25,490
Speaker 1: I'm not saying the second half is 9 star because I don't think it is.

646
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:31,042
Speaker 1: I think it's more like 7 or 6 But it feels like 5 or 4 because the first part is like 9.

647
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:35,049
Speaker 0: but enough people were talking smack about it that I felt The need to spoil it for myself.

648
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:41,950
Speaker 1: I think the other Reason that they don't like the second half is because the characters in the first half are a lot better.

649
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,433
Speaker 1: There's only one annoying character Which is Misa Misa.

650
00:43:44,894 --> 00:43:48,985
Speaker 1: and then you know characters get subtracted and then added in the second half.

651
00:43:49,286 --> 00:43:51,232
Speaker 1: and the characters they add no one Likes them.

652
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:51,875
Speaker 1: they suck.

653
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,042
Speaker 1: They're not interesting.

654
00:43:53,082 --> 00:43:54,107
Speaker 1: No one can identify with them.

655
00:43:54,147 --> 00:43:54,630
Speaker 1: No one cares.

656
00:43:54,951 --> 00:43:57,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know and that's you know people.

657
00:43:57,542 --> 00:44:01,089
Speaker 1: if you look at what makes an anime popular It's having characters that people like.

658
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:03,037
Speaker 1: They look at Fullmetal Alchemist.

659
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:06,170
Speaker 1: most of what that anime's got going for is characters people like huh?

660
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:15,079
Speaker 0: It's almost like they think with Naruto It's almost like the Fullmetal Alchemist people designed a host of characters that together would have enough Popularity to make a blockbuster.

661
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:17,490
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like why harem shows are so successful.

662
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:26,705
Speaker 1: It's because they have one girl for every possible taste in women that a middle school kid can have and that an old Perverted guy can have that no matter who's watching the show.

663
00:44:26,745 --> 00:44:29,916
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a character They really like their harem shows for girls.

664
00:44:29,977 --> 00:44:30,699
Speaker 0: Remember of mine.

665
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:34,490
Speaker 1: Liebe, which they have one guy character for every possible.

666
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,837
Speaker 0: Hello, I'm the naughty German boy.

667
00:44:37,057 --> 00:44:37,398
Speaker 0: Hello.

668
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:38,702
Speaker 0: I'm the cute German boy.

669
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:39,284
Speaker 0: Hello.

670
00:44:39,424 --> 00:44:41,530
Speaker 0: I am the normal awesome German boy.

671
00:44:41,994 --> 00:44:44,292
Speaker 0: I am the bearded German boy Exactly.

672
00:44:44,332 --> 00:44:48,466
Speaker 1: So no matter what your taste is there's a character that you can get with in death note.

673
00:44:48,948 --> 00:44:50,787
Speaker 1: not the case Especially the second half.

674
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:55,750
Speaker 1: But anyway Ryuk is the man and he is there throughout.

675
00:44:56,831 --> 00:45:03,875
Speaker 0: Yep, it's really hard to get rid of a god of dead and Ryuk and Misa Misa are really the only Comedy in this whole thing.

676
00:45:03,936 --> 00:45:05,781
Speaker 0: It's a really dark manga.

677
00:45:06,182 --> 00:45:07,466
Speaker 0: It's a really dark show.

678
00:45:07,486 --> 00:45:11,726
Speaker 1: Yeah That's I guess that's why I like the lighter parts better.

679
00:45:12,007 --> 00:45:18,160
Speaker 0: Oh His reeks there that was that was terrible pun.

680
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,805
Speaker 0: That was really fucking bad.

681
00:45:19,825 --> 00:45:23,525
Speaker 1: Okay, so Yeah death note.

682
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:31,950
Speaker 0: cool Yeah, we were also gonna talk about pumpkin scissors tonight But we decided not to mostly because I'd like to spend more than five minutes talking about it.

683
00:45:32,351 --> 00:45:37,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much saying before the show should we talk about both of these shows or just one?

684
00:45:37,886 --> 00:45:44,421
Speaker 1: and we said, okay We'll talk about death note and see how long we talk and if we don't talk long We'll start talking about pumpkin scissors.

685
00:45:44,482 --> 00:45:45,810
Speaker 1: and I guess what we talked long.

686
00:45:46,224 --> 00:45:50,570
Speaker 0: Yep Because a lot of you have been asking is what we think of pumpkin scissors and we haven't watched it yet until just now.

687
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:54,304
Speaker 1: I think what we'll do is watch the second episode to you know tomorrow.

688
00:45:54,464 --> 00:46:01,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I think next week We're probably going to do two previews of two shows that don't deserve quite as much talk as the death note show did.

689
00:46:01,814 --> 00:46:11,942
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know I think that the death note show like I don't know if it's a good enough show to really deserve the whole episode But because it's based on such a great manga you gotta gotta give it up.

690
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus people have been clamoring for that, too.

691
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, so clamor no more.

692
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:21,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I will say about pumpkin scissors I'm probably not going to watch more of it.

693
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:27,070
Speaker 1: No, I'm definitely not gonna watch more pumpkin scissors despite its funny name and awesome logo.

694
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:31,750
Speaker 0: I think anime world order is is right about their whole gonzo hypothesis, but we'll talk about that.

695
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to think differently.

696
00:46:33,177 --> 00:46:49,182
Speaker 0: But yeah, well there is one possible exception But I have to see the end of the show to find out anyway done for that next week And that was geek nights with rim and Scott special.
