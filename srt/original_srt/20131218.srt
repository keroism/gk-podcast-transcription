1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,877
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, December 18th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,160
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:13,464
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:17,029
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, the anime Silver Spoon.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,668
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:32,560
Speaker 1: So on my way home from work today, I encountered a man derping about with an m4 carbine.

7
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:36,333
Speaker 0: Why would a guy be allowed to have that in Manhattan?

8
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,260
Speaker 1: Well, actually it was in New Jersey.

9
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:40,968
Speaker 1: I was in New Jersey doing a thing.

10
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:41,632
Speaker 1: I had to go home.

11
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:42,959
Speaker 0: So where in New Jersey was this?

12
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:45,492
Speaker 1: Like exchange place where that path station is.

13
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,798
Speaker 0: You're just allowed to have m4s there?

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,229
Speaker 1: Well, it was one of those.

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,139
Speaker 1: And allowed to derp with them?

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,020
Speaker 0: I mean, so it was one thing to walk down the street holding a gun or having one in a holster.

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it was path, like security.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,523
Speaker 1: Like, you know how in Grand Central there's like a military dude.

19
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:58,970
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's a guy who was supposed to have one.

20
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,914
Speaker 1: Yeah, with m4s.

21
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:00,960
Speaker 1: They kind of hang around sometimes.

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,000
Speaker 0: Why was he derping with it, getting ready to shoot someone and get all over the evening news?

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:05,582
Speaker 1: Here's what derped.

24
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:12,019
Speaker 1: There were two of these guys and they're walking and talking and doing their thing and there's a ton of people with guns like that all around.

25
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:13,805
Speaker 1: So I'm kind of walking slow.

26
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,450
Speaker 1: Like something's not going on, is it?

27
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,520
Speaker 1: Because there's like heavily armored cop cars everywhere.

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,904
Speaker 1: There's cops everywhere.

29
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:28,620
Speaker 1: They're all heavily armed, but they're all kind of walking around and joking and in the end I guess it was probably like a training or maybe it was like new guys first day on the job.

30
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,054
Speaker 1: I don't know.

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:45,537
Speaker 1: So I go into the path station and in front of me two guys with m4s are kind of walking and the first one goes through the revolving door and then like the guns a little too long for the small revolving door and it like everything all bangs together and he gets kind of half stuck and has to like back his way out.

32
00:01:45,557 --> 00:02:01,940
Speaker 1: and as this happens the guy walking behind him I see him reach out like he's gonna be like yo dog don't go in the revolving door and then he just turns to the left ignores the guy who gets derped and stuck in the sliding door walks around to the regular door laughing to himself.

33
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:21,920
Speaker 1: So the moral is if you have to get away from guys who are I don't want to say Renicoffs, but people with m4s who carry them around but don't use them all the time or longer guns even if you can get through a revolving door, they might not be able to easily follow you unless there's a non revolving door nearby.

34
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:24,789
Speaker 0: Was it a glass revolving door?

35
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,779
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, he could probably try to shoot me through it.

36
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:30,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, or just shoot the glass and run through.

37
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,258
Speaker 1: That would actually be kind of hard because the it was one of those kind of narrow revolving doors.

38
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:42,680
Speaker 1: Mostly it was the idea that he didn't connect the fact kind of like a dog who has a bone that's too big and he can't get through the dog door.

39
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,937
Speaker 0: It's a cop who doesn't use hold it vertically in front of you.

40
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:47,600
Speaker 0: Wouldn't that be enough?

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,860
Speaker 1: I guess he could have but it's kind of like he didn't think about it.

42
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,490
Speaker 1: He didn't think about these two different parts of his life.

43
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,140
Speaker 0: No different than if you had say an umbrella or a sword.

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,895
Speaker 1: But you're generally holding umbrellas vertically all the time even when they're closed or open.

45
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:03,698
Speaker 1: You're not holding your gun vertically you're holding it at the ready.

46
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:06,400
Speaker 0: At the ready for a big danger in New Jersey.

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you know they have that like kind of sideways holster where it kind of hangs there.

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,755
Speaker 1: But yeah, basically I think the my bone is too big was not connected to the.

49
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:18,619
Speaker 1: I'm about to walk through a revolving door parts of his brain.

50
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:20,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, much more fun.

51
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,736
Speaker 1: I got food poisoning over the weekend.

52
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:24,760
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a shame.

53
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,893
Speaker 1: Yeah, skiing at Hunter Mountain, which was awesome.

54
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:29,380
Speaker 1: There was crazy blizzard snow.

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,689
Speaker 0: It's the number one most fate made fun of lowest quality.

56
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,412
Speaker 0: rent a mountain.

57
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:36,180
Speaker 1: The thing is it's actually the highest quality mountain around.

58
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Speaker 0: Except everyone else except you says differently.

59
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:40,780
Speaker 1: Who?

60
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,569
Speaker 1: Who would ever say that?

61
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,920
Speaker 1: The mountains around New York City suck fucking balls.

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,323
Speaker 0: That's what they're saying.

63
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:50,771
Speaker 0: But these are people who like go to Vermont and Colorado.

64
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:51,132
Speaker 0: Yeah.

65
00:03:51,574 --> 00:03:53,460
Speaker 1: Well, I also go to places like Vermont.

66
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:54,540
Speaker 1: It's way better there.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:02,380
Speaker 1: But within a reasonable drive of New York City, Hunter Mountain is so much better than every other mountain that's within a reasonable drive.

68
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:02,721
Speaker 0: Yes.

69
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:06,260
Speaker 0: At my house, Time Warner Cable is the best Internet service you can get.

70
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:10,040
Speaker 1: No, it's actually a pretty good mountain, especially if you want to train.

71
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,792
Speaker 1: Like it has reasonably difficult terrain.

72
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:12,820
Speaker 1: The back mountain is pretty good.

73
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:20,600
Speaker 1: So if you want to train or practice without wasting your like nice fancy ski trips somewhere better and bigger, it's a great place to ski.

74
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,747
Speaker 1: It's actually a really good place.

75
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,900
Speaker 0: You've never even skied.

76
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,789
Speaker 0: No, I'm just saying what other people say.

77
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:26,171
Speaker 0: Who?

78
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:27,620
Speaker 1: Who has said that that you know?

79
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,809
Speaker 0: People at my work?

80
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,620
Speaker 0: Name anyone.

81
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,927
Speaker 0: People at my work.

82
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:32,640
Speaker 1: What did they actually say about Hunter Mountain?

83
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,180
Speaker 0: They were like, yeah, I really want to go skiing, but I'm going to go shitty Hunter Mountain.

84
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,103
Speaker 1: All right.

85
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:38,709
Speaker 1: So I take it.

86
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:39,980
Speaker 1: they're taking an entire weekend.

87
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,120
Speaker 0: And I said my friend goes there and they're like, yeah, that place is so low rent.

88
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,947
Speaker 0: I'm going to Vermont.

89
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:45,200
Speaker 1: All right.

90
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,840
Speaker 1: It's actually for where in Vermont?

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,382
Speaker 1: Killington.

92
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:51,060
Speaker 1: Killington is a pretty good mountain, but the terrain's not better.

93
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,008
Speaker 1: It's just a bigger mountain.

94
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,260
Speaker 0: I don't know where they went in Vermont.

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,900
Speaker 0: I think some place where they like friend had a cab and some shit.

96
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,283
Speaker 0: I don't know.

97
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:58,000
Speaker 1: OK, that doesn't really narrow it down.

98
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,464
Speaker 1: I don't know.

99
00:04:58,626 --> 00:04:59,740
Speaker 1: Killington's where most people go.

100
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,739
Speaker 1: It's where most people know about.

101
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,280
Speaker 1: But Hunter Mountain is pretty seriously.

102
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,659
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of other skiing around here.

103
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,880
Speaker 1: But I can take a bus in the morning to the mountain ski and take a bus back home.

104
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:18,660
Speaker 1: And on that bus back home, despite the best conditions Hunter Mountains had in like five years, because it actually snowed, there was I ate some pizza.

105
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,006
Speaker 0: And on this bus.

106
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:20,999
Speaker 0: Where did this pizza come from?

107
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,645
Speaker 1: Hunter Mountain.

108
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,840
Speaker 1: Hunter Mountain's cafeteria.

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,580
Speaker 0: OK.

110
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:31,660
Speaker 1: So two hours later, I wake up on the bus and the movie Down Periscope with Kelsey Grammer is playing on the TV really loudly.

111
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:33,418
Speaker 1: And I feel kind of nauseous.

112
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:36,635
Speaker 1: So I'm wondering, am I just sick?

113
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:37,319
Speaker 1: What's going on?

114
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,400
Speaker 1: And then I cartoon vomit.

115
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,620
Speaker 1: You know, when someone vomits the cartoon, their cheeks go like, whoop, that happened.

116
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:45,048
Speaker 0: OK, so.

117
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:46,980
Speaker 0: So I swallowed it all.

118
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:54,640
Speaker 1: And then I staggered to the back of the bus and vomited a copious amount of pizza into the bus.

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,500
Speaker 0: Now, do you know for sure that it was food poisoning visa?

120
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,620
Speaker 0: What did you eat for breakfast?

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,853
Speaker 1: So I did not eat breakfast before lunch.

122
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:09,140
Speaker 1: I had chili also at Hunter Mountain, but the chili digested.

123
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:11,309
Speaker 1: I ate the chili at like eleven.

124
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:15,000
Speaker 1: I ate the pizza at like four.

125
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,560
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't matter which one it was because it was Hunter Mountain food and Hunter Mountain food.

126
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,679
Speaker 1: I got sick at about seven.

127
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,499
Speaker 0: So Hunter Mountain food was guilty no matter what.

128
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,720
Speaker 1: So this is where my odyssey from hell begins, because the bus ride is only supposed to take like two and a half hours.

129
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,918
Speaker 0: But the snow.

130
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,760
Speaker 1: So the snow turned into a blizzard, which delayed the bus heavily.

131
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,679
Speaker 0: Wasn't a blizzard.

132
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,217
Speaker 1: And up there it was.

133
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:42,980
Speaker 1: Scott, I don't think you realize how much more snow they get outside of New York City.

134
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,445
Speaker 0: There was.

135
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,079
Speaker 0: I used to live there.

136
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was like seven inches of snow up there.

137
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,720
Speaker 0: I lived there for the better part of a decade.

138
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,931
Speaker 1: We used to live in Rochester.

139
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:50,600
Speaker 1: Remember that?

140
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:50,964
Speaker 1: Yeah.

141
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:51,517
Speaker 1: Remember that?

142
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:59,000
Speaker 1: We'd wake up one morning and we'd see our basement window of our basement apartment literally entirely blocked with snow.

143
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:01,039
Speaker 1: I'd wake up and say, hey, Scott, fuck.

144
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,399
Speaker 1: And you yell, fuck.

145
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:03,494
Speaker 1: And then we'd go to school.

146
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:03,859
Speaker 1: Fuck.

147
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,519
Speaker 1: So then the bus broke down.

148
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,519
Speaker 0: All right.

149
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,280
Speaker 1: At like nine o'clock.

150
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,619
Speaker 1: So already I've been on this bus.

151
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,500
Speaker 0: At least you can get off the bus and vomit now.

152
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,480
Speaker 1: No, it broke down on the side of the freeway next to nothing in the middle of a blizzard.

153
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:19,821
Speaker 0: Right.

154
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:22,040
Speaker 0: So you can go out to the nothing and vomit in the nothing.

155
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,519
Speaker 1: No, they wouldn't let us off the bus.

156
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:25,060
Speaker 1: It was dark and dangerous.

157
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,979
Speaker 1: There were cars sliding around in the freeway everywhere and a bus was broken down.

158
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:30,518
Speaker 0: The bus is guarding you from the slip and slide.

159
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,260
Speaker 1: No, actually, a lot of people get killed by getting out of vehicles that are stopped on the sides of freeways like that.

160
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,176
Speaker 0: Even if you go in.

161
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,600
Speaker 0: I mean, if you go into the road.

162
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:37,945
Speaker 0: Yeah.

163
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:38,999
Speaker 0: But if you go into the grass.

164
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:39,782
Speaker 1: Yeah.

165
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:40,898
Speaker 1: That's usually where you get hit.

166
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,840
Speaker 0: But as long as you stay with the bus in between you and the highway.

167
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,279
Speaker 1: No, because the bus will get hit and slide into you.

168
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,580
Speaker 0: The bus will just fall on top.

169
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,640
Speaker 1: Also, Scott, there was not much room on the side of the road.

170
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,419
Speaker 1: I looked out there.

171
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,517
Speaker 0: There's enough room for some puke.

172
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,600
Speaker 1: Plus, I could just keep vomiting in the bathroom because it was food poisoning.

173
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,100
Speaker 1: I vomited every like 18 minutes almost to the second.

174
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,800
Speaker 0: How did everyone else feel about the bathroom smelling like vomit?

175
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:06,258
Speaker 1: They were very quiet about it.

176
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:07,680
Speaker 0: They were not also vomiting?

177
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,840
Speaker 1: No, because no one.

178
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:16,960
Speaker 1: So when I first got on the bus, all I could think was I'm so much smarter than all these people because everyone was super hungry and kind of like, oh, my God, I want some food.

179
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:20,820
Speaker 1: And I walked on the bus with the two slices of pizza that I bought at Hunter Mountain.

180
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:22,860
Speaker 1: And I was like, I'm eating this in front of everyone.

181
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:24,899
Speaker 1: I feel so happy.

182
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:32,080
Speaker 1: So the movie downed Periscope looped for the third time.

183
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,438
Speaker 0: Now it's looping.

184
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,316
Speaker 1: It's looping.

185
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:36,639
Speaker 0: No one says anything about that?

186
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,878
Speaker 1: People seem OK with it.

187
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,628
Speaker 1: I don't know if they did.

188
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:39,460
Speaker 1: It was all snowboarders.

189
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,659
Speaker 1: So I imagine they were just high.

190
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,578
Speaker 0: Oh, so they didn't need to.

191
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,559
Speaker 1: I think I was literally the only skier on the bus.

192
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,640
Speaker 1: There's one person thought they knew me and they knew I. was they because I had a Red Wings jersey.

193
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:51,360
Speaker 1: They're like, oh, you're Aaron's friend.

194
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,743
Speaker 1: Right.

195
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,820
Speaker 1: And I was like, maybe.

196
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:55,535
Speaker 1: And she's like from Detroit.

197
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:55,940
Speaker 1: Right.

198
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,880
Speaker 1: The guy from Detroit, Aaron's friend.

199
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:01,880
Speaker 1: I know like three people named Aaron and I am from Detroit.

200
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,900
Speaker 1: And I didn't think that I was wearing the Red Wings jersey.

201
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,098
Speaker 1: So how they would do with that.

202
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:07,637
Speaker 1: So this person thought they knew me.

203
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,279
Speaker 1: So they tried to offer sympathy.

204
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,180
Speaker 1: But then I realized they didn't know me.

205
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,020
Speaker 1: It was hard to back out of that social situation.

206
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:20,800
Speaker 1: And then the bus exploding was great because basically we're driving and suddenly I hear the bus driver go, well, fuck.

207
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,939
Speaker 1: And then white smoke just starts pouring out of the front of the bus.

208
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:29,835
Speaker 1: So the bus stops and everyone in the bus sitting there like, oh, man.

209
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,820
Speaker 1: There are other things that happen on this journey.

210
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,129
Speaker 1: There was Chinese girl who was late to the bus.

211
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,340
Speaker 1: every time you could possibly be late to the bus.

212
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,247
Speaker 0: Why did they wait for her?

213
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,398
Speaker 1: I don't know.

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,703
Speaker 0: Just leave her there.

215
00:09:41,723 --> 00:09:45,900
Speaker 1: They actually tried to leave her, but then they saw her running after the bus just as they went to leave.

216
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,260
Speaker 1: I mean, you can't just leave when you see them like 10 feet away.

217
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,105
Speaker 1: You know, I would.

218
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:51,589
Speaker 0: I would.

219
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:52,820
Speaker 0: You totally can.

220
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:53,983
Speaker 1: I would.

221
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:56,440
Speaker 0: That'll give them a story and you a story.

222
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,604
Speaker 1: Other highlights involved.

223
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:01,580
Speaker 1: Ten minutes on the road when this obviously stone guy staggers up to the front.

224
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Speaker 1: He's like, yo, bus driver, you could find it in your heart to stop it like a beer store for like 10 minutes.

225
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,820
Speaker 1: We collected a bunch of tips and we'll make sure you get nicely tipped.

226
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,420
Speaker 1: And he's like, you can't drink alcohol on the bus.

227
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:17,219
Speaker 1: And the guy's like, oh, we're not we're not going to buy beer.

228
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:19,820
Speaker 1: And the bus driver is like, you said a beer store.

229
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:23,640
Speaker 1: What did you expect to buy at the beer store?

230
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:29,280
Speaker 1: And the guy was just like, oh, well, sodas and bus drivers like sit down.

231
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:33,860
Speaker 0: The bus driver should have been like, you're not allowed to drive beer on this bus.

232
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,519
Speaker 0: So make sure you only drink beverages and brown paper bags on this bus.

233
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,780
Speaker 1: Dude, I've been on these buses where sometimes they hand everyone a beer as they get back on the bus.

234
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,705
Speaker 0: Right.

235
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:45,720
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that was my weekend.

236
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,438
Speaker 1: Two days of being bedridden, vomiting every 20 minutes.

237
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,004
Speaker 1: That was awesome.

238
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:59,160
Speaker 1: So, Hunter Mountain, I'd like to thank you for probably the fourth best skiing day of my entire life going back and for the ridiculous food poisoning.

239
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:05,479
Speaker 1: I actually was so mad about this that I filed an official complaint form to the New York State Department of Health.

240
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:08,800
Speaker 1: Let me tell you, that website is archaic as fuck.

241
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,038
Speaker 1: And I had to fax this motherfucker over there.

242
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,177
Speaker 1: OK, so, yeah, anime.

243
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:16,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, there's some news.

244
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,582
Speaker 0: Right.

245
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:23,000
Speaker 0: And, you know, I know we talk about this a lot on this show, but this is actually almost definitely going to be the last time we talk about it.

246
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:26,520
Speaker 0: Bitcoin's no anime news.

247
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,960
Speaker 0: Nina's anime news.

248
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,259
Speaker 0: Nina is the best webcomic.

249
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,010
Speaker 1: That was my news.

250
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:30,660
Speaker 0: That's yes.

251
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,225
Speaker 0: My news.

252
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:32,479
Speaker 1: That was my news.

253
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,818
Speaker 0: That's a problem, isn't it?

254
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:34,427
Speaker 1: OK.

255
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:34,691
Speaker 1: Yeah.

256
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,723
Speaker 0: Anime news.

257
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:37,660
Speaker 0: Nina, it's been over for a while.

258
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:38,758
Speaker 0: So sad.

259
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:48,300
Speaker 0: But she just today started the Kickstarter to get a physical copy of a book that I assume will contain every single anime news.

260
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,400
Speaker 0: Nina comic ever plus extra stuff.

261
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:53,360
Speaker 1: This is definitely worth getting if you're an anime fan.

262
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,462
Speaker 0: And it's like twenty five bucks just to get to the paper book level, which is totally reasonable.

263
00:11:57,482 --> 00:12:00,300
Speaker 1: I mean, it wasn't the best webcomic ever.

264
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:01,819
Speaker 0: It's just a really good webcomic.

265
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,904
Speaker 1: You know what it's like?

266
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:08,899
Speaker 1: It's like the bad boys of computer science in that for the people it was for, it spoke to us.

267
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,223
Speaker 0: For us?

268
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:10,519
Speaker 0: Yes, it's for us.

269
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,707
Speaker 1: And it also it had that sort of.

270
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:18,779
Speaker 1: it had the level of snark that you so rarely see in an official sponsored webcomic.

271
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:23,179
Speaker 0: Like the comic for I don't know, like NFL comic right now.

272
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,541
Speaker 0: Yeah.

273
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:24,063
Speaker 1: Like or like.

274
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:30,580
Speaker 1: if Nike, the shoe brand, made a comic about shoes, it wouldn't be a comic that made fun of people buying expensive shoes.

275
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,449
Speaker 0: It'd be garbage.

276
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:32,220
Speaker 1: Anime news.

277
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,800
Speaker 1: Nina was the comic that made fun of anime fans.

278
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:35,462
Speaker 0: Yeah.

279
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:39,840
Speaker 0: It's like here's a comic and the art customer news network sponsored by the store.

280
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:45,042
Speaker 0: It's like you go into a GameStop and you buy a comic book and it's the official Gamescom book.

281
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:49,022
Speaker 0: and it makes fun of people like look at these dumbasses selling their games back to GameStop.

282
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:54,659
Speaker 0: They're all poor and they can just sell them on Amazon or just buy them somewhere else to begin begin with.

283
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,020
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's a Kickstarter for it now.

284
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,400
Speaker 0: This is the last anime news, need a thing that will likely ever exist.

285
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:06,340
Speaker 0: So it's the last time we'll talk about it, which is why it's worth talking about.

286
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:14,349
Speaker 1: So I guess in other news, anime news came to an end and it turns out that there's going to be a Kickstarter.

287
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:16,940
Speaker 0: I don't really don't have another news.

288
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:21,860
Speaker 1: I guess I think there's a new My Little Pony mini comic that features Luna coming out.

289
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,290
Speaker 0: No, I mean, there's the.

290
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:23,896
Speaker 0: there's two.

291
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:24,843
Speaker 0: I'm like.

292
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,760
Speaker 1: I'm like scraping Tumblr and Twitter.

293
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,140
Speaker 0: Some people who don't know the IDW prints two different.

294
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,760
Speaker 0: Well, now I think three different My Little Pony comics now.

295
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,041
Speaker 0: Right.

296
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:39,662
Speaker 0: There's My Little Pony Friendship is Magic, which is the, you know, you know, the straight up.

297
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:45,255
Speaker 0: the comic that is serial and it tells, you know, is stories and is just, you know, the real comic.

298
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:45,418
Speaker 0: Right.

299
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:47,060
Speaker 0: It's the comic of My Little Pony.

300
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:53,120
Speaker 0: Then there's another one that's super new, which is literally just take the TV show and turn it into comics directly.

301
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:54,980
Speaker 0: You don't need to read that if you watch a TV show.

302
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,789
Speaker 0: I'm not buying that shit.

303
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:56,620
Speaker 0: Just a waste of money.

304
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,021
Speaker 0: Right.

305
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:59,860
Speaker 0: There's another one that's My Little Pony Micro Series.

306
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,142
Speaker 0: And the way that works is each issue of it focuses on one character and only one character.

307
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:09,661
Speaker 0: So I guess the Luna issue is coming or is coming out now or as soon or whatever.

308
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:17,639
Speaker 0: But yeah, I'm actually more excited for that series because well, because of this cover here, that is what I saw.

309
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:28,623
Speaker 0: No, but I think what's going to happen, though, is I think either A, the series will end, which will be sad, or B, they'll start digging into the lower and lesser characters more and more.

310
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:32,344
Speaker 0: It'll be like, which could be like, yeah, like the krills and sofas issue.

311
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:32,726
Speaker 0: Right.

312
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:34,580
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, shit, I'm all over that.

313
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,000
Speaker 1: I was about to say that's that's when Moses, like it's his own episode.

314
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,783
Speaker 0: Exactly.

315
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:40,431
Speaker 1: I'm so about Simpsons comics.

316
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:44,339
Speaker 0: for people who don't know, Simpsons comics are not bad and they've been going on for fuck ever.

317
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:48,020
Speaker 0: And they've already done this with pretty much every Simpsons character imaginable.

318
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,340
Speaker 0: I have Professor Frank comics, comes with 3D glasses, but seriously, that work.

319
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,492
Speaker 1: The new season of My Little Pony is fine.

320
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:56,964
Speaker 1: It's good.

321
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:57,511
Speaker 1: I like it.

322
00:14:57,551 --> 00:14:58,139
Speaker 1: I'm watching it.

323
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,440
Speaker 0: It's not Equestria Girls.

324
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,043
Speaker 1: It's good.

325
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:01,960
Speaker 1: It's pretend Equestria Girls didn't exist.

326
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Speaker 1: The My Little Pony comics are ace and you should be reading them.

327
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are hilarious.

328
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,159
Speaker 1: So anyway, things of the day.

329
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:25,300
Speaker 1: Hey, Scott, back when we were at RIT living in Colony, there was I had a terrible book on the bookshelf and I was really interested in that topic for a time.

330
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,479
Speaker 1: You remember what that book was about?

331
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,444
Speaker 0: Something.

332
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,580
Speaker 0: Oh, is that Egypt alien nonsense?

333
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:37,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, so the book was Egypt like basically Egypt research, Egypt research people, some guy who believed aliens built pyramids.

334
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,782
Speaker 1: The problem is he didn't put the aliens into this book until like three quarters of the way through.

335
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:43,180
Speaker 1: You read this book and it's like you believe that shit.

336
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,580
Speaker 1: I did not believe the alien shit.

337
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,280
Speaker 0: You believed it at one point.

338
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:46,942
Speaker 1: Not the alien.

339
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:51,403
Speaker 0: When you got to RIT, you believed all sorts of crazy shit and then you learned you were wrong.

340
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:55,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I believe you're believing like that for fairies lived in the woods.

341
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,499
Speaker 1: Here's an example.

342
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:06,400
Speaker 1: I believed because I read all these studies about the great Sphinx and how the great Sphinx was clearly eroded by water at some point and not by sand.

343
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:08,860
Speaker 0: Not by Napoleon's cannon shooting his nose off.

344
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,733
Speaker 1: Then it should have been.

345
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,055
Speaker 0: It wasn't Napoleon's cannon, like Alexander the Great had a cannon somehow.

346
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:23,620
Speaker 1: or that the great pyramid, the complex at Giza, those three pyramids actually are a lot like they have the same arrangement and brightness as Orion's belt.

347
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,280
Speaker 1: And yeah, that stuff's all completely bullshit.

348
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,980
Speaker 0: Anything in a set of three, Orion's belt, but three little pigs, Orion.

349
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:34,999
Speaker 1: So that book was awful.

350
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:40,639
Speaker 1: But the one thing that I learned from it that was real was there was a study, the Upawalt, whatever, it was a project.

351
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,220
Speaker 1: Well, because one thing that is true, there are these shafts in the great pyramid.

352
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:44,882
Speaker 0: Yeah.

353
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,739
Speaker 1: No one really knows exactly what they were for, but they're there.

354
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
Speaker 1: And a long time ago, like in the 90s, people built a robot.

355
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:54,040
Speaker 0: They sent the robots down the shaft.

356
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,783
Speaker 0: Everyone knows this.

357
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:56,191
Speaker 1: And there was a big event on TV.

358
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:58,284
Speaker 1: where they live showed like this is what's here.

359
00:16:58,344 --> 00:16:59,391
Speaker 0: Remember what they found?

360
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,243
Speaker 0: Nothing.

361
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:02,358
Speaker 1: Nope, they found a door.

362
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:09,167
Speaker 1: OK, and they couldn't get past it and there was a little handle on the door and then the robot couldn't go any further.

363
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,980
Speaker 1: And it was basically nothing.

364
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,960
Speaker 1: So even after I realized that book was just by now, nobody's opened the door.

365
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,125
Speaker 1: So I wondered for years if anyone had ever followed up on that study, like what was behind that door?

366
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:24,200
Speaker 0: I can easily open that door now.

367
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,032
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure everyone.

368
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:25,256
Speaker 0: Yeah.

369
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,440
Speaker 1: So it turns out only recently did anything actually happen with that.

370
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,343
Speaker 0: What did they do?

371
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:33,100
Speaker 1: So another team sent another robot.

372
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,521
Speaker 1: Yeah.

373
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:34,486
Speaker 1: Made a new robot.

374
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:36,716
Speaker 1: because remember, that first project was in like the 90s.

375
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,580
Speaker 1: Robot technology fucking sucked back.

376
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,372
Speaker 0: They found a robbed tomb.

377
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:42,480
Speaker 0: that's so even grave.

378
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,520
Speaker 1: There's a new robot that was just way better in every way.

379
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,466
Speaker 1: And I found this.

380
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:50,520
Speaker 1: This is like some crazy fan website, but I did check it out.

381
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:58,580
Speaker 1: The graphic design of this site aside, this is the best collection of all the actual pictures and stuff that they found with this new robot in the Great Pyramid.

382
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:00,170
Speaker 1: And they found cool shit.

383
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:01,399
Speaker 0: How cool could it be?

384
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,979
Speaker 1: So behind that door, there was another door.

385
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:04,724
Speaker 0: Nice.

386
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:06,619
Speaker 1: And they drilled a hole in that other door.

387
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:10,722
Speaker 1: And they actually found a bunch of hieroglyphics written in like this red ochre back there.

388
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:10,783
Speaker 1: OK.

389
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:20,542
Speaker 1: And all this other stuff and all the research that they found to date, everything they found since then, which happened in like 2012.

390
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:21,667
Speaker 1: So relatively recently.

391
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,104
Speaker 1: And it looks like it was only disrupted by the troubles in Egypt right now.

392
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,960
Speaker 1: So there's going to be further study.

393
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,520
Speaker 1: But this is actually, if you ever wondered what the deal was with that door, it actually was only recently that we found out anything.

394
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:36,369
Speaker 1: And what we found was pretty cool.

395
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,363
Speaker 1: Like, look, we actually found that there's the final door.

396
00:18:39,404 --> 00:18:43,083
Speaker 1: There's like this blocking slab and it looks like there's space behind it.

397
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,380
Speaker 1: And there's these metal loops that are kind of stuck into the back of it.

398
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,077
Speaker 1: that looks like it was used to set them in.

399
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:53,040
Speaker 1: So this is just like this crazy collection of all the pictures and all the detail.

400
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,018
Speaker 1: Like, look, even the raw composites.

401
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,343
Speaker 1: So if you ever cared about the pyramids, here's some of the hieroglyphics they found.

402
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:02,140
Speaker 1: They think they're engineering marks.

403
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:02,864
Speaker 0: Maybe.

404
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,640
Speaker 1: This is actually pretty cool.

405
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,139
Speaker 1: This gives closure to a part of my life.

406
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,190
Speaker 1: I've wondered for so long.

407
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,180
Speaker 1: The fuck was behind that door?

408
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,060
Speaker 0: They didn't find an alien skull?

409
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,602
Speaker 1: Nope.

410
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,279
Speaker 1: They found another door.

411
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,407
Speaker 1: Hooray.

412
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,015
Speaker 0: Door number one.

413
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:19,509
Speaker 0: Here's a quote.

414
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:20,300
Speaker 1: Here's a quote.

415
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,620
Speaker 1: At first glance, the second blocking stone seems to be just a large, relatively rough-hewn block sitting at the end of the U-block.

416
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:34,760
Speaker 1: However, the intriguing thing is that there appear to be red ochre masons marks on both walls at the far end where they meet the second blocking stone.

417
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,138
Speaker 0: This suggests that there's no way humans could have done this.

418
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,778
Speaker 1: Actually, this article is like, humans clearly did this.

419
00:19:45,182 --> 00:20:00,820
Speaker 1: Though the graphic design of this website might lead you to believe otherwise, the project is called, in similarly unpronounceable word to the previous Upawala Hualua project, is the Hawaiian or Egyptian?

420
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:02,360
Speaker 1: The jetty project.

421
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,205
Speaker 1: I guess Jedi.

422
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:06,558
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a Java parameter like -D Jedi.

423
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:07,861
Speaker 0: Anyway.

424
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:09,940
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is pretty cool.

425
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,401
Speaker 0: All right.

426
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:14,668
Speaker 1: So also this robot is so much smaller than the robot they used on that old documentary.

427
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:15,640
Speaker 0: Modern technologies.

428
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

429
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:17,080
Speaker 0: All right.

430
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,879
Speaker 0: So, uh, you know, who out?

431
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:20,685
Speaker 0: Right.

432
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:22,100
Speaker 0: Well, that's definitely Egyptian.

433
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:24,900
Speaker 1: U-P-U-A-U-T was the previous one.

434
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:28,340
Speaker 0: OK, so, you know, Dim Mak, right?

435
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,439
Speaker 0: You just hit a guy in the back of the neck and he dies.

436
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,162
Speaker 1: Yup.

437
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:37,260
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember that video we found where we watched that video and we were both like, did we just watch someone die?

438
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:38,380
Speaker 0: And it's complete horseshit.

439
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:38,963
Speaker 0: Yup.

440
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:40,739
Speaker 0: Basically, people just pretend.

441
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,880
Speaker 0: I mean, well, and it's sort of it's basically hypnotism, right?

442
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,079
Speaker 0: Because people believe in it so much that it works on them.

443
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:47,800
Speaker 1: I mean, I saw that episode of Batman.

444
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:48,789
Speaker 0: Right.

445
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:49,300
Speaker 0: Exactly.

446
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,539
Speaker 0: So that was actually one of the best episodes.

447
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:53,666
Speaker 0: It was.

448
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,760
Speaker 0: And it totally can exist in Batman universe.

449
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,122
Speaker 0: Why not?

450
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:58,558
Speaker 1: It's right up there with that the episode with the giant computer.

451
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,330
Speaker 0: Hard act.

452
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,553
Speaker 0: Yeah.

453
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:01,060
Speaker 0: All right.

454
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,420
Speaker 0: So anyway, hard act part two also.

455
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:02,842
Speaker 0: All right.

456
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,440
Speaker 1: So, well, there's apparently some say just hard act part one.

457
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:06,740
Speaker 0: Yeah.

458
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:12,420
Speaker 0: There's another thing besides Dim Mak called EFO, which is Empty Force something.

459
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,080
Speaker 1: What?

460
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:16,360
Speaker 0: Empty Force is even crazier than Dim Mak.

461
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,640
Speaker 0: These guys believe you don't even have to touch someone.

462
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,219
Speaker 0: You basically just like knock them down.

463
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,803
Speaker 0: Well, wait.

464
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,640
Speaker 1: I actually studied that at RIT.

465
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,320
Speaker 1: I'm doing it right now to all the listeners.

466
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's basically the same idea, right?

467
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:34,979
Speaker 0: Is the of some master of martial arts and he has followers who truly believe in it so much that they're hypnotized into believing it works.

468
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:43,020
Speaker 0: So when he uses this, you know, EFO on them, they actually fall down and believe that, you know, they're not just falling down on purpose.

469
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,680
Speaker 1: There is possibly another explanation.

470
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,417
Speaker 1: They might simply be faking it.

471
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,342
Speaker 1: Bootlickers.

472
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,860
Speaker 0: It's possible that they're all just faking it on purpose anyway.

473
00:21:51,421 --> 00:22:00,210
Speaker 0: So one of these guys, EFO guys, he had like a sort of, I guess, free trial class, like come see a demonstration and see.

474
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:03,680
Speaker 0: if you want to, you know, and if you like it, sign up for my because he's trying to make money.

475
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:03,901
Speaker 0: Right.

476
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,439
Speaker 0: He's like, sign up for my classes and you can learn to do this, too.

477
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:10,540
Speaker 0: So they allowed cameras at this thing, which is unusual.

478
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,540
Speaker 1: Big mistake, dude.

479
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,739
Speaker 0: So some skeptic dudes showed up with their cameras and they're videoing.

480
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,362
Speaker 0: Right.

481
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,059
Speaker 0: And they get up and they're like, oh, can you try it on me?

482
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:20,228
Speaker 0: And he's like, all right.

483
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,620
Speaker 0: And he's like trying it on the guy.

484
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,719
Speaker 0: And it doesn't do anything because he doesn't believe in it.

485
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Speaker 1: The video is so great.

486
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:27,679
Speaker 0: And then he's like, all right, can I can I push you?

487
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,480
Speaker 0: And he's like pushing the guy around, just like push, push.

488
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:32,679
Speaker 0: And it's like the EFO is not working on him.

489
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,422
Speaker 0: Right.

490
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:38,378
Speaker 0: At the best part is at the end, this dude gets up and he's like, I'm probably the weakest guy in this room.

491
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,024
Speaker 0: Right.

492
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:40,379
Speaker 0: But I can do this.

493
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,060
Speaker 0: And he goes over like a punching bag and just punches it a few times.

494
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,367
Speaker 0: He's like, he's like, if someone comes and does that to you and, you know, the EFO, is that going to stop him?

495
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:49,660
Speaker 0: Can I can I do this to you?

496
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,297
Speaker 0: And he's like, no, you can't do that to me.

497
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:54,078
Speaker 0: And you only use the EFO against me.

498
00:22:54,903 --> 00:22:56,140
Speaker 0: He's like, no, you can't do that.

499
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,819
Speaker 0: We're not going to let you punch me.

500
00:22:58,103 --> 00:22:58,960
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, really?

501
00:22:59,220 --> 00:22:59,561
Speaker 0: All right.

502
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:04,603
Speaker 0: And then the guy the guy's like, you know, well, you're going to pay for lessons in the EFO.

503
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:08,226
Speaker 0: He's like, I came here, you know, because I was going to sign up for this if it really worked.

504
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,719
Speaker 0: Clearly, it doesn't work.

505
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,840
Speaker 0: Now, if it worked, I totally signed up for this shit.

506
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,399
Speaker 0: I want to knock people over without having to touch them.

507
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,700
Speaker 1: All of you out there, take take this lesson to heart.

508
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:27,440
Speaker 1: If you want to punk people who believe in woo woo, you need to pretend to be earnestly interested and not just shoot them down right away.

509
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,000
Speaker 1: Tell them, play the the ardent believer or the person who wants to believe.

510
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:43,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's much better to go in and be like, well, listen, I came here expecting to have all my diseases cured, but I come here and I'm still just as sick as ever.

511
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,398
Speaker 0: In fact, I'm more sick.

512
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,876
Speaker 0: Well, this is a bunch of work.

513
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:48,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really want your magic to work.

514
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,740
Speaker 0: How can your magic's not working?

515
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,420
Speaker 0: Don't don't be all like this.

516
00:23:52,903 --> 00:23:55,480
Speaker 1: You know, I do that after the fact, the post-hoc.

517
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:55,762
Speaker 0: Right.

518
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:56,860
Speaker 0: You go in for the faith heal.

519
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,319
Speaker 0: You're like, oh, heal me, faith healer.

520
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,380
Speaker 0: I still have cancer, faith healer.

521
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,247
Speaker 0: You didn't do shit.

522
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:03,359
Speaker 0: I'm dying.

523
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,370
Speaker 0: It's still real.

524
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:05,100
Speaker 1: It hurts even worse.

525
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,787
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

526
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:06,860
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not helping.

527
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:14,526
Speaker 1: So should you go to the faith healer with fake illnesses and then be like, oh, you made it worse.

528
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:15,419
Speaker 0: Now I can't see.

529
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,920
Speaker 0: Bring some bring some like, you know, those those blood things with you.

530
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,750
Speaker 0: So it looks like that would be some.

531
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,355
Speaker 0: some like does this thing.

532
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,680
Speaker 1: And then just blood starts.

533
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,323
Speaker 0: No, no.

534
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:30,460
Speaker 0: Have like an Ipaca capsule, like in the corner of your mouth.

535
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,217
Speaker 0: And then once he tries his faith healing, bite into it.

536
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:40,279
Speaker 1: No, you know, the ones who like walk up to you and go like, but bam and knock you down as soon as he does it.

537
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:46,336
Speaker 0: Blood needs to explode from your eyes, your ears and your chest might be like, oh, we got all the bad blood out of his body.

538
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,744
Speaker 0: He's healed.

539
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:51,540
Speaker 0: You can't give him any excuse.

540
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,479
Speaker 0: It's got to be obvious that it that it, you know.

541
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,439
Speaker 1: The vomit, he's vomited out the demon.

542
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:57,439
Speaker 1: You see the problem here?

543
00:24:57,721 --> 00:24:58,529
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly.

544
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,439
Speaker 0: You got to do it just right.

545
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:02,179
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that's pretty awesome.

546
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:07,380
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the book, the book is Iduru by William Gibson.

547
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:08,290
Speaker 0: I started reading it.

548
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,200
Speaker 0: I read like three chapters.

549
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:10,679
Speaker 1: I'm most of the way through it again.

550
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,960
Speaker 1: I'm reading it twice.

551
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,546
Speaker 1: I'll see.

552
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:13,177
Speaker 1: I've lapsed.

553
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,399
Speaker 0: Daddy, daddy to pee pee.

554
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,475
Speaker 1: It's if I'd say anything about this book, it is so, so 90s dystopia.

555
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,320
Speaker 0: Sure.

556
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:25,660
Speaker 1: Like this might as well be set in the same world as Strange Days.

557
00:25:26,364 --> 00:25:26,404
Speaker 0: OK.

558
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:27,700
Speaker 1: I like it, though.

559
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,599
Speaker 1: I liked it when I read it before and I like it again.

560
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:32,880
Speaker 0: Other meta things.

561
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:42,060
Speaker 0: So we're always hyping up all the places to go and see us on the Internet, like Twitter, YouTube, our website, our forums, our IRC channel, just emailing us the newsletter.

562
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,612
Speaker 0: I haven't sent out in a while that I completely forgot about that.

563
00:25:44,632 --> 00:25:45,355
Speaker 0: I'll send out again, etc.

564
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:54,559
Speaker 0: There is one place I was reminded of today that I forgot existed because I don't really use it, but other people do use it.

565
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:56,219
Speaker 0: That is El Steam group.

566
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,799
Speaker 0: There is an official geek night steam group.

567
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:01,680
Speaker 0: It has existed since like 07.

568
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,880
Speaker 0: There's like a hundreds of geek nights listeners in there.

569
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:11,840
Speaker 0: So if you are a loser and you have no one to play steam games with and you need friends to play steam games with, join that steam group called Geek Nights.

570
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,149
Speaker 0: It's just a public group.

571
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:13,897
Speaker 0: You can just join it.

572
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:28,777
Speaker 0: And if you see other people are online in that group, you can message them and at least you will have one thing in common, which is that you know who we are and then you can play games together and don't suck at games because a lot of those people are good at games better than us.

573
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:32,959
Speaker 1: Also, we finally do to you guys constantly asking for it.

574
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:41,800
Speaker 1: I've uploaded the entirety of Beyond Dungeons and Dragons as we presented it on Friday at PAX Australia in Melbourne.

575
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:42,483
Speaker 0: All right.

576
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,659
Speaker 1: So it's up there.

577
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,980
Speaker 1: You can watch it in its fullness and more video to come as we have time.

578
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,440
Speaker 1: The production of new episodes of Geek Nights presents was somewhat delayed by my food poisoning, so hopefully we'll pick it up sometime shortly after the holidays.

579
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,161
Speaker 0: Yep.

580
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,978
Speaker 0: We also have a new show we're going to do.

581
00:27:00,805 --> 00:27:01,108
Speaker 1: Yep.

582
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,319
Speaker 0: You'll see it when it comes.

583
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,359
Speaker 1: It's a new Geek Nights presents that I would watch.

584
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,939
Speaker 0: I think we might change the name of it.

585
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,402
Speaker 1: I got some other name ideas, but but at the same time, it's going to be a pretty good brand name.

586
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:15,800
Speaker 0: Well, you know, you want to keep your eye on the Twitch channel.

587
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:16,342
Speaker 0: Yes.

588
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:27,198
Speaker 0: If you follow the Twitch channel, this has been happening to me lately is you'll get messages like on your phone and stuff whenever the Twitch channel goes live and then you know to go and watch.

589
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:29,660
Speaker 0: So do we have a Geek Nights Twitch channel?

590
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:30,407
Speaker 1: No, we have.

591
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:31,760
Speaker 1: I have mine and you have your eyes.

592
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:39,039
Speaker 0: I'm going to make a Geek Nights one and then I'll tweet it on the Geek Nights Twitter and such, and then I'll post it around and everyone follow it.

593
00:27:39,402 --> 00:27:42,180
Speaker 0: And then if we go live on that channel, then you'll know.

594
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,660
Speaker 0: That way, we don't have to tell you what time the show is or anything.

595
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,880
Speaker 0: You just and then, of course, that shit will be on YouTube eventually.

596
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:48,322
Speaker 0: Yep.

597
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:50,820
Speaker 1: In some sort of edited, compiled fashion.

598
00:27:51,241 --> 00:28:02,120
Speaker 1: But rest assured, like other projects we've done, we're excited enough about this one to tell you that it's coming, but not excited enough to tell you what it is because we don't know if it'll actually we got it.

599
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,167
Speaker 1: We got to do a test run.

600
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,780
Speaker 0: We can't shit talk, right?

601
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just got to make sure it works.

602
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,999
Speaker 0: However, if this works, can we do what we think we want to do?

603
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,843
Speaker 1: I will say this.

604
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:14,180
Speaker 1: Test audiences have found this to be utterly hilarious.

605
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,238
Speaker 0: How many test audiences?

606
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,180
Speaker 1: One, Emily, one, Natalie and Judith, I believe.

607
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:21,719
Speaker 1: OK, they watched one time.

608
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,243
Speaker 0: That's true.

609
00:28:22,645 --> 00:28:24,899
Speaker 1: Plus, there were other similar tests.

610
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:30,080
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember way back, a particular thing involving Spelunky happened.

611
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:31,082
Speaker 0: OK.

612
00:28:31,484 --> 00:28:34,879
Speaker 1: And I remember that being hilarious to the few people who were in the room who weren't you.

613
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,789
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, join our forum.

614
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:40,400
Speaker 1: It's bigger and better than it's ever been.

615
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm double saying it because we're paying a lot of money for this forum now.

616
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:43,846
Speaker 0: That's right.

617
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:44,560
Speaker 0: Go to Magfest.

618
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,965
Speaker 1: Oh, Magfest.

619
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,979
Speaker 1: I don't think it's sold out, but the hotel is.

620
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,439
Speaker 0: If you don't go to Magfest.

621
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,822
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

622
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:54,219
Speaker 1: And we're going to be at Magfest presenting bad games.

623
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:56,928
Speaker 1: Games 10 and 20, 10 and 30 years from now.

624
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,640
Speaker 1: Video game controllers will be on that panel and Scott will be on that panel.

625
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,858
Speaker 0: And I'll see how that panel goes.

626
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,718
Speaker 1: Privacy and games.

627
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,139
Speaker 0: And it's sitting on that panel instead of another panel.

628
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,040
Speaker 1: I'm going to be I'm going to pick one of the panels we're on and just be super adversarial.

629
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:18,580
Speaker 1: Like whatever position the Zeitgeist takes in the room, I'm just going to take the exact opposite.

630
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,060
Speaker 0: I don't think the game controllers panel will necessarily be bad, but basically right now it has no focus.

631
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,000
Speaker 0: Like every each there's so many things to talk about when it comes to controllers that you could talk for days about just like one controller.

632
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,461
Speaker 0: Right.

633
00:29:29,882 --> 00:29:36,740
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's like each person has like a different thing they want to talk about and there's no real unifying idea.

634
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,900
Speaker 0: So I'm basically just going to sit there and, you know, say whatever comes to mind.

635
00:29:41,141 --> 00:29:45,720
Speaker 1: Well, the privacy in games one, the discussion on what to talk about took about a half hour.

636
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:48,719
Speaker 1: And we all agree there's an agenda and it looks really fun.

637
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:52,200
Speaker 1: And games 10 to 30 years from now, you saw that email.

638
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,145
Speaker 1: I got to respond to that.

639
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:55,819
Speaker 1: I don't want I don't want the audience to interact at all.

640
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,943
Speaker 1: No, I got to make.

641
00:29:57,204 --> 00:30:01,920
Speaker 1: So when I send the email saying, yo, I don't want the audience to interact.

642
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,500
Speaker 1: I want you to also say that so that we have enough people saying that to override the people who want audience interaction.

643
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,083
Speaker 0: Of course.

644
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:10,773
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I'm going to be it.

645
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,637
Speaker 1: Guys, listeners, if you're at Magfest, I will tell you if audience interaction is going to happen at that panel.

646
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:18,520
Speaker 1: we don't want it to happen in.

647
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:27,480
Speaker 1: If it does, I warn you, I want you to show up and interact awesomely and I mean, destroy the panel.

648
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:32,400
Speaker 1: So recall a while ago we did that panel at Anime Boston.

649
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,698
Speaker 1: We reviewed the season of anime before it came out.

650
00:30:35,422 --> 00:30:37,780
Speaker 1: One of the shows we talked about was Silver Spoon.

651
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:49,499
Speaker 0: And we looked at that one and we prejudged it based on a JPEG and a short paragraph description that it was a show with some serious quality potential, because A, did not look perverted in any way.

652
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:54,339
Speaker 0: B, was not a typical anime fighting kind of plot of shallowness.

653
00:30:56,181 --> 00:31:02,480
Speaker 0: And C, it looked bright and colorful and happy times, but not, you know, totally wacky and crazy kid show time.

654
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,359
Speaker 1: Yes, straight up based on a manga, not a light novel, probably not too porny.

655
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:08,223
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

656
00:31:08,264 --> 00:31:13,220
Speaker 0: So Silver Spoon is not a sitcom from the 80s about.

657
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:17,280
Speaker 1: I was going to make a Silver Spoons joke later.

658
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,359
Speaker 0: A kid so rich he had his own pinball machine and shit.

659
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:27,252
Speaker 1: So really, what we said is that we expected this to be one of those sort of sort of slice of life.

660
00:31:27,532 --> 00:31:31,360
Speaker 1: camaraderie shows that simultaneously was going to teach you stuff about farms.

661
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:33,718
Speaker 1: And it is it is that to a T.

662
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:40,340
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know if it's necessarily the it's not super slice of life because there is a plot, right?

663
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,480
Speaker 1: The plot is that resolved itself already.

664
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:43,126
Speaker 0: That's right.

665
00:31:43,146 --> 00:31:44,660
Speaker 0: We'll get to get to that.

666
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:44,962
Speaker 0: Right.

667
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:46,919
Speaker 0: But the plot is basically have this kid.

668
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,619
Speaker 0: He's going to high school for whatever reason.

669
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:51,129
Speaker 0: He gets ready.

670
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,320
Speaker 0: He doesn't want to be near his parents.

671
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,120
Speaker 0: He wanted to get as far away from his parents as he could.

672
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,800
Speaker 0: So he went to a boarding school and his teacher from his middle school figured out that he should go to this farm school.

673
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:01,426
Speaker 0: So he went there.

674
00:32:01,446 --> 00:32:02,920
Speaker 0: He had no interest in farming whatsoever.

675
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:04,303
Speaker 0: And he gets there.

676
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:11,220
Speaker 0: And everyone else who's there is someone who wants to do farming or is like works on a farm or lives on a farm or is a farmer.

677
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,320
Speaker 0: And they're like, one girl is like, I want to make cheese.

678
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:14,607
Speaker 0: That's what I'm going to do in my life.

679
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,860
Speaker 1: And that girl is the second cutest girl in the show.

680
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,281
Speaker 0: Yeah.

681
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,060
Speaker 0: And I mean, the girl you're supposed to like is the cutest.

682
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,462
Speaker 0: Yeah.

683
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:20,644
Speaker 0: Right.

684
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:22,160
Speaker 0: And that girl is like she wants horses.

685
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:26,340
Speaker 0: And the other one is like cows are all about cows winning blue ribbons.

686
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:26,944
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

687
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:28,280
Speaker 0: Those guys who were in the Holstein Club.

688
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:29,229
Speaker 1: The Holstein Club.

689
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:29,754
Speaker 1: Yeah.

690
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:30,360
Speaker 1: The best.

691
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:33,960
Speaker 0: And then you got, you know, all kinds of different.

692
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:34,222
Speaker 0: Right.

693
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:36,120
Speaker 0: Everything you could possibly think of on a farm.

694
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:36,926
Speaker 0: Right.

695
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:37,920
Speaker 0: There's someone there.

696
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,120
Speaker 0: It's like they all know what they want to do with their lives already.

697
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:43,379
Speaker 0: You know, and this guy shows up and he's like, oh, my God.

698
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:46,120
Speaker 0: Eggs come from a chicken, but it's Gabriel.

699
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,427
Speaker 1: But it's like it's a cloaca.

700
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:49,239
Speaker 1: He's like, no, it's an anus, anus, anus.

701
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,723
Speaker 0: They can't even eat an egg.

702
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:55,360
Speaker 1: Now that he's seen this is a great scene where he's sitting there in the cafeteria and ever seen these eggs.

703
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,240
Speaker 1: And he keeps picturing it coming out of the chicken.

704
00:32:57,682 --> 00:32:58,752
Speaker 1: And he just like can't eat it.

705
00:32:58,772 --> 00:32:59,619
Speaker 1: He's freaking out.

706
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:06,236
Speaker 1: And he just keeps thinking in his head, anus, anus, anus, Charles, anus, Charles, can't eat.

707
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,660
Speaker 0: the egg came out of a butt.

708
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:12,980
Speaker 0: I mean, the show starts out, we clean the egg, dude, and that is a shell to the show.

709
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:22,020
Speaker 1: Pretty much immediately gets into that very kind of important point about farming that farmers and food involves killing.

710
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:22,561
Speaker 0: Yeah.

711
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:28,880
Speaker 0: I mean, even to go see a vet at like the horse race track and it's like, you know, one guy, he's like, I want to be a vet.

712
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:32,200
Speaker 0: So he asked the you know, he's like, hey, well, what does it take to be a vet?

713
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,019
Speaker 0: He's like, got to be able to kill animals.

714
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:36,659
Speaker 0: If you can't deal with killing animals, can't be a vet.

715
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:37,282
Speaker 1: Yep.

716
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:43,180
Speaker 1: Or right away, like they help a bunch of upperclassmen get some chickens that were loose and then the guy's like, oh, thanks.

717
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,339
Speaker 1: Then immediately starts killing them right in front of him.

718
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:47,159
Speaker 1: And then says, oh, I'll give you some of the chicken later.

719
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,900
Speaker 0: He gives them some of the chicken later.

720
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,140
Speaker 0: And he just imagines, he remembers that chicken's head being cut off.

721
00:33:52,340 --> 00:34:04,640
Speaker 1: So the show really, really kind of elegantly handles the whole dichotomy of a farmer on one hand, caring very much for the welfare of their animals, while simultaneously recognizing that those animals are to be killed and eaten.

722
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:05,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, he named a pig.

723
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,223
Speaker 0: I'm waiting.

724
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:07,600
Speaker 0: He named the pig Pork Bowl.

725
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,699
Speaker 1: Episode nine appears to be when that gets resolved.

726
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,820
Speaker 0: He's going to become bacon.

727
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,340
Speaker 1: Episode nine, Hachi Kitten hesitates and it's a picture of him and Pork Bowl.

728
00:34:17,965 --> 00:34:18,719
Speaker 0: Pork Bowl is done.

729
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,199
Speaker 1: Pork Bowl is going to become Bacon Bowl.

730
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,878
Speaker 0: Pork Bowl is definitely going to become Bacon Bowl.

731
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,257
Speaker 0: One hundred percent.

732
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:33,179
Speaker 1: Like the opener has this really poignant moment where you see him sitting down and there's a spread of food in front of him, all this beef and eggs and meat.

733
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:40,280
Speaker 1: And then behind him, walking up are the ghosts of all these baby pigs and baby cows and baby chickens.

734
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:43,100
Speaker 1: And then he eats the meat and he's really conflicted.

735
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,839
Speaker 1: And then the fat girl steals it.

736
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:47,280
Speaker 0: The fat girl is actually pretty cool.

737
00:34:47,442 --> 00:34:47,898
Speaker 0: I like her.

738
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:52,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you see a character like that and it's like, oh, they're going to be making like fat jokes and shit.

739
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:55,620
Speaker 1: I knew a girl who looked almost exactly like that when I was in high school.

740
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,340
Speaker 0: But it's like she's actually crazy awesome.

741
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,100
Speaker 0: She's smart.

742
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,860
Speaker 0: She's not, you know, she doesn't have a good personality.

743
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,958
Speaker 0: She works hard.

744
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:06,520
Speaker 0: You know, she doesn't, you know, she's she just looks that way.

745
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,620
Speaker 0: I like when they meet her brother and he's super tall and they're both in the ping pong club and are crazy awesome at ping pong.

746
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,005
Speaker 0: Yeah.

747
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:12,480
Speaker 0: Right.

748
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,480
Speaker 0: And it's like, all right.

749
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:19,180
Speaker 0: They didn't make this fat character like, you know, the annoying character that you see in a lot of other shows.

750
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,380
Speaker 0: There actually is no bad character or annoying character.

751
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,139
Speaker 0: Like everyone is a good guy in the whole show.

752
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:26,260
Speaker 1: But everyone's got some deal going on.

753
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,419
Speaker 1: And the character designs are all over the place, which I actually really like.

754
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:35,680
Speaker 1: Like every character is extremely unique to the point that I recognize.

755
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,220
Speaker 0: I love Buddha horse racing cheese.

756
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:37,943
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

757
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:42,440
Speaker 1: The teacher who looks like Buddha, who hides cheese on campus.

758
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,660
Speaker 0: He's not just hiding cheese.

759
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,880
Speaker 0: He's hiding an entire cheese cellar.

760
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,520
Speaker 1: Never mind the whole cheese cellar.

761
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,677
Speaker 1: You know how many wheels are down there?

762
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,799
Speaker 1: That he is that he is a straight up gambling addict.

763
00:35:54,624 --> 00:35:55,427
Speaker 1: Right.

764
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:58,800
Speaker 0: But at the same time, when he's out with the horse club, he's so Buddha like.

765
00:35:59,121 --> 00:35:59,351
Speaker 0: Right.

766
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:00,105
Speaker 1: Yeah.

767
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,660
Speaker 0: But it's just like he's multiple.

768
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,280
Speaker 0: You just keep using the same character in different situations.

769
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:04,802
Speaker 0: Like, all right.

770
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:08,180
Speaker 0: He's a cheese hoarder and a gambling addict and a Buddha and a horse.

771
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,520
Speaker 0: And he's so calm and takes care of the horse.

772
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,438
Speaker 0: He's all nicely.

773
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,160
Speaker 1: But at the same time, he he has aspects of the Buddha.

774
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,760
Speaker 1: Or he'll say there's one moment where the characters want something from him.

775
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,817
Speaker 1: He's like, no, I won't give it to you.

776
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:22,939
Speaker 1: But the way he says that is something like the root of all human intuition and whatever is greed.

777
00:36:24,103 --> 00:36:25,317
Speaker 1: And they're like, you're just being stingy.

778
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:27,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're greed gives the cheese.

779
00:36:31,683 --> 00:36:35,860
Speaker 1: But yeah, the show is just really fun, really well put together.

780
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,800
Speaker 0: The characters are all just makes you feel good to feel good show.

781
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,420
Speaker 1: Every time I thought, oh, the show is going to get boring.

782
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,360
Speaker 1: It would just immediately skip to something new.

783
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,720
Speaker 1: Like it keeps staying fresh and introducing new elements and new characters and new plots and new twists.

784
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,980
Speaker 0: So that's the thing I think is almost the show's problem.

785
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:51,422
Speaker 0: Right.

786
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:56,140
Speaker 0: Is that the conflicts and are all resolved so quickly.

787
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,766
Speaker 0: It's like this guy gets to the.

788
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:01,540
Speaker 0: you know, you think the show's going to be about him learning to deal with the farm.

789
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,420
Speaker 0: He learns to deal with it right away.

790
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,740
Speaker 0: He's like like, you know, after the chicken thing, he's like, nope, don't make assumptions.

791
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:08,445
Speaker 0: And he doesn't.

792
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:10,438
Speaker 1: He basically but he doesn't deal with it 100 percent.

793
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:11,868
Speaker 1: He still has issues.

794
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:13,260
Speaker 0: He still hesitates a little bit.

795
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,280
Speaker 0: But he's like, no, like he knows consciously, like I have learned my farm lesson.

796
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:18,947
Speaker 0: I'm doing this.

797
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:20,240
Speaker 0: And he just does it every time.

798
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:26,100
Speaker 1: Like I was so worried that Haji Ken was going to have this long running gag where he would like flip out every time a farm thing.

799
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:26,708
Speaker 1: Happened.

800
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:27,479
Speaker 1: And it'd be a big deal.

801
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,020
Speaker 0: I know he gets so he learns his lesson once and then he learns his lesson mostly.

802
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:31,642
Speaker 1: Right.

803
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:34,860
Speaker 0: And that's refreshing that someone learned their lesson so quickly.

804
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,280
Speaker 0: But it also basically removes a whole conflict from the show because it got resolved so early.

805
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,440
Speaker 1: It's like in Fushigi Yugi, you really want Miyaka and Taka and Tomohome to be together.

806
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,764
Speaker 1: You really want that to happen.

807
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:50,280
Speaker 1: And as soon as they're together, the next episode, you really wish one of them would die.

808
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,248
Speaker 0: You're right.

809
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:52,060
Speaker 0: Exactly.

810
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:54,255
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, they got together.

811
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:54,599
Speaker 0: Now what?

812
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:59,920
Speaker 1: But he has a sort of more existential crisis, as Scott was alluding to, around the fact that he doesn't know why he's there.

813
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,709
Speaker 1: He doesn't want to be there.

814
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:01,540
Speaker 1: He doesn't get the farm.

815
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,362
Speaker 0: Yeah.

816
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:04,060
Speaker 0: It's like he's really good at everything, though.

817
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,460
Speaker 0: So but there still is a question of what is he going to do?

818
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,319
Speaker 1: I like how he looks down on the other kids at first because they're really dumb at things like math.

819
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,800
Speaker 0: He's the number one smartest kid in the school.

820
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,500
Speaker 1: I really well, in the beginning, it looked like they were setting him up to be really good at academics, but fail all the farm stuff.

821
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,540
Speaker 1: But now he's top student in everything.

822
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:25,337
Speaker 0: He's just the best.

823
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,700
Speaker 1: But like Keiji, that kid who's like, you got to tutor me in math.

824
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:32,099
Speaker 1: And he's like, this is middle school stuff, dude.

825
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:35,780
Speaker 1: And he's like, and Keiji says, never underestimate my stupidity.

826
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:36,858
Speaker 0: That's a good line.

827
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,260
Speaker 1: And then he's like, all right, fine, I'll start teaching you.

828
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,588
Speaker 1: So this is X and that's Y. He's like, X?

829
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:54,760
Speaker 0: But other than the mystery of why does he hate his parents and want to get away, which is clearly something to do with, you know, the whole Japanese, you know, pressure to do well, whatever.

830
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,401
Speaker 0: Right.

831
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:59,280
Speaker 0: He probably just worked crazy hard studying and didn't have a life in middle school or whatever.

832
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was going to that cram school.

833
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,560
Speaker 0: You know, other than that, right.

834
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,504
Speaker 0: Mystery of what actually happened.

835
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:11,680
Speaker 0: that brought him to the farm school, which is already mostly revealed, not completely revealed, but mostly revealed.

836
00:39:12,342 --> 00:39:16,040
Speaker 0: It's like, I guess is, is he going to get together with the girl?

837
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:23,780
Speaker 1: But his finding of some sort of purpose, the yeah, the 26 episodes of Initial D are still going to be four episodes.

838
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,499
Speaker 0: He's learned he likes this stuff and he's learned he can be good at whatever he wants to be good at.

839
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:29,660
Speaker 0: And at the end of episode four.

840
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,139
Speaker 0: What is he actually going to do?

841
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,919
Speaker 0: Like, what is his area of expertise going to be?

842
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,360
Speaker 1: So I wonder if, because it's interesting, I've never had this happen before.

843
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:43,218
Speaker 1: We decided to watch four episodes for the review because that's the classic RIT anime sprint.

844
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,439
Speaker 0: Felt like it could have been the last episode of the show.

845
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:47,920
Speaker 1: If that had been the whole show, that would have been a great show.

846
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:50,920
Speaker 0: You could have just pretended that was episode four.

847
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,579
Speaker 0: It was the last episode and not watched any more of it.

848
00:39:53,721 --> 00:39:55,038
Speaker 0: And you would have believed it was the end.

849
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,498
Speaker 1: Though you would also have learned that Japanese people have a really fucked up sense of what a pizza is.

850
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:03,680
Speaker 1: He's like, I'm going to make a pizza.

851
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:04,799
Speaker 1: Oh, but I need bacon.

852
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:05,318
Speaker 1: It's like, what?

853
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:06,792
Speaker 0: Why not?

854
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:08,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

855
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:08,356
Speaker 1: Indeed.

856
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:14,780
Speaker 1: But the fact that you don't think I'm going to make a pizza, semi-colon, I need bacon.

857
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:16,779
Speaker 1: That's not the first thing you think.

858
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,580
Speaker 1: Bacon is one of those more esoteric ingredients on a pizza.

859
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:22,060
Speaker 1: It's not the first thing.

860
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,340
Speaker 0: You do when your pet's name is Porpo.

861
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:28,119
Speaker 1: That pizza did look really good, though.

862
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:29,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd eat that.

863
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,500
Speaker 1: It was like that thick bacon and asparagus and tomato sauce and that cheese they stole.

864
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:35,380
Speaker 1: Well, they didn't steal it.

865
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,580
Speaker 1: They blackmailed him to get it.

866
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,177
Speaker 0: You know, they talked about getting flour where they had to just fuck tons of flour, right?

867
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:43,000
Speaker 0: They did not mention where they got any yeast from.

868
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:49,820
Speaker 0: Not to say that a farm has no yeast, but there was an ingredient there that they did not source.

869
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,580
Speaker 1: Maybe they got natural yeast or maybe they keep cultures.

870
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,518
Speaker 0: I'm just saying they probably do, but they didn't.

871
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,460
Speaker 0: Every single other ingredient had a character associated with it.

872
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:04,339
Speaker 0: Exactly, but they didn't even bother mentioning, you know, that one ingredient that was necessary for the dough.

873
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:11,740
Speaker 1: I'm wondering it, but it's weird that so usually four episodes is enough to give you a sense of a show, but not accomplish anything significant.

874
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:18,019
Speaker 1: Like I remember Initial D at the end of episode four, you know what the show is like, but you don't know if Takumi wins that first race.

875
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:20,498
Speaker 1: Four episodes was our go to.

876
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,920
Speaker 0: The fourth episode of this is basically a race that he wins in the end.

877
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:24,737
Speaker 0: And that's the end.

878
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:31,900
Speaker 1: So I'm wondering if the rest of the show just takes off on the farm stuff in much more detail and a bunch of like subplots and all the other characters.

879
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hope it goes off the other characters.

880
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:37,200
Speaker 1: I really want to see what a lot of their like one episode each resolve their deal.

881
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,000
Speaker 1: I would like to see that Mayumi goes home to her cheese house episode.

882
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:45,379
Speaker 1: Or Tomoko and whatever her like ping pong life is like.

883
00:41:48,750 --> 00:42:00,269
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you need a feel good anime to watch after you watch Kill la Kill because that's only 20 minutes long and you already watched the episode of Kill la Kill twice, then you can watch this.

884
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,070
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

885
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,689
Speaker 1: I watched the first episode of Kill la Kill again the other day.

886
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,370
Speaker 0: God damn, I am hard pressed.

887
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,965
Speaker 0: My favorite episode is still the one where they get a uniform or didn't have one.

888
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,290
Speaker 0: They keep getting better apartments and better apartments and better apartments.

889
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:17,409
Speaker 1: That was a pretty good episode.

890
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,550
Speaker 1: Kill la Kill is just, we'll talk about it again once it's done.

891
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,730
Speaker 1: There's no point in even saying anything other than that.

892
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,229
Speaker 1: It's everything we expected it to be and more.

893
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:34,150
Speaker 1: Just that first episode when the kids are running down the stairs and you see Gomigori just falling in the window.

894
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:45,750
Speaker 1: So if you're not watching Kill la Kill or you just need more anime to watch and you one of the better shows that's ongoing right now that we know that we've seen.

895
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:47,750
Speaker 1: I've got, I've scrolled through country girl.

896
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:57,670
Speaker 1: There's maybe five other shows I would consider possibly having potential that are ongoing right now that maybe we'll have to watch four episodes of and review.

897
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:01,790
Speaker 1: I think I will watch the rest of Silver Spoon.

898
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,570
Speaker 1: I might if I have time, but I'm going to not binge on it.

899
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,530
Speaker 1: I'm going to watch it sporadically until Kill la Kill ends.

900
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:15,170
Speaker 1: If I haven't finished Silver Spoon and Kill la Kill ends, then I'm going to watch Ghost in the Shell and then once that's done, I'm waiting to see.

901
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:15,689
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

902
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:17,009
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of anime right now.

903
00:43:17,432 --> 00:43:19,510
Speaker 0: I'm not watching because I'm waiting like Gundam Unicorn.

904
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,129
Speaker 0: The last episodes coming like early next year.

905
00:43:22,752 --> 00:43:25,922
Speaker 0: As soon as that comes out, I'm going to watch all the Gundam Unicorns and Ghost in the Shell Arise.

906
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,088
Speaker 0: As soon as the last one comes out, going to watch all of them.

907
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,190
Speaker 0: Evangelion, you know, something you will not not 99.

908
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,941
Speaker 1: You will not watch movies, whatever.

909
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,910
Speaker 1: I'm going to watch all those when all of them are out, right?

910
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,190
Speaker 0: So it's like there's a whole ton of animes that are really good.

911
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:42,810
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I watch Adventure Time.

912
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,909
Speaker 1: If Adventure Time comes out, I pretty much watch it that day.

913
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:46,930
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't.

914
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,650
Speaker 0: I guess this might be a couple of Adventure Times.

915
00:43:48,931 --> 00:43:50,530
Speaker 1: No, there hasn't been another episode.

916
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,090
Speaker 1: In fact, the last time I checked, there was no date for the next episode.

917
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,150
Speaker 0: What's the newest episode?

918
00:43:54,773 --> 00:43:55,589
Speaker 1: It's still Root Beer Guy.

919
00:43:56,193 --> 00:43:56,950
Speaker 0: I haven't seen that one.

920
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,310
Speaker 0: There you go.

921
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,448
Speaker 1: Oh, you should watch that one.

922
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:01,167
Speaker 1: So you saw James.

923
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,230
Speaker 1: Yes, the one after James.

924
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:03,950
Speaker 1: It's just Root Beer Guy.

925
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,949
Speaker 1: Just a guy going about his life.

926
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:06,570
Speaker 0: All right.

927
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,888
Speaker 1: Reminds me of Davey a little bit.

928
00:44:08,214 --> 00:44:08,429
Speaker 0: Okay.

929
00:44:09,391 --> 00:44:09,987
Speaker 1: He's Root Beer Guy.

930
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:10,750
Speaker 0: Okay.

931
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,490
Speaker 1: But I don't think... They haven't announced more episodes.

932
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:18,690
Speaker 1: Though I did watch the semi-episode that is in the cutscenes of the Adventure Time dungeon game.

933
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:19,247
Speaker 0: Was it good?

934
00:44:21,213 --> 00:44:22,950
Speaker 1: It revealed information.

935
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:23,630
Speaker 1: Okay.

936
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:25,309
Speaker 1: There was only one good thing.

937
00:44:25,991 --> 00:44:28,630
Speaker 1: I'm going to spoil it because that game is so shit.

938
00:44:28,772 --> 00:44:28,858
Speaker 0: Good.

939
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,150
Speaker 1: So you can watch the cutscene.

940
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,910
Speaker 1: There's almost no content in these cutscenes.

941
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:34,222
Speaker 0: Okay.

942
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:37,830
Speaker 1: The big monster at the end is Pingu and it explodes everywhere.

943
00:44:38,338 --> 00:44:39,110
Speaker 1: And it gets all over...

944
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:41,430
Speaker 0: Is it Princess Bubblegum?

945
00:44:42,353 --> 00:44:43,830
Speaker 1: It's her parents, basically.

946
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:44,269
Speaker 0: Okay.

947
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,989
Speaker 1: It gets all over LSP, but it doesn't get all over anyone else.

948
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:56,190
Speaker 1: So there's this heartfelt moment in the foreground where Princess Bubblegum and Finn and everyone are kind of explaining what happened and kind of talking it out.

949
00:44:56,531 --> 00:45:00,410
Speaker 1: And in the background, LSP is just getting increasingly visibly angry.

950
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:03,110
Speaker 1: How come it got all over me and not all over everybody else?

951
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:04,190
Speaker 1: This is so gross.

952
00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:09,689
Speaker 1: Oh, and she's getting madder and madder and madder at how dirty she is and how no one else was affected.

953
00:45:10,492 --> 00:45:13,110
Speaker 1: And that was the funniest thing in that entire fucking game.

954
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:13,684
Speaker 0: Okay.

955
00:45:15,173 --> 00:45:15,388
Speaker 1: All right.

956
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:15,530
Speaker 1: Yeah.

957
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,169
Speaker 1: Watch Silver Spoon if you're not watching all those other things we talked about.

958
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:23,806
Speaker 1: Might be one or two more episodes of Geek Nights until next year, but don't hold your horses.

959
00:45:24,743 --> 00:45:25,728
Speaker 1: We're... Don't hold your breath.

960
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:26,970
Speaker 1: Don't count your horses.

961
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,848
Speaker 0: You're lucky you got this one.

962
00:45:28,731 --> 00:45:31,009
Speaker 1: It's busy times for Rim and Scott right now.

963
00:45:37,755 --> 00:45:39,890
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

964
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:45,009
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

966
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:53,350
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

967
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,110
Speaker 1: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

970
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:09,050
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
