1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,228
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, December 15th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:10,570
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:14,078
Speaker 0: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,805
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:16,908
Speaker 1: It is our holiday.

6
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:22,281
Speaker 1: animation, anime, and comics gift-giving guide 2021.

7
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:23,318
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,400
Speaker 1: So, uh, we were- I drove Emily upstate just to hang out with her aunt and we were doing some stuff up there the other day on Monday.

9
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:35,611
Speaker 1: And, uh, I discovered their huge movie buffs, these two.

10
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:38,360
Speaker 1: They had never seen- and they're big anime fans, too.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,280
Speaker 1: They just had never seen Cowboy Bebop and, uh, they didn't notice it was on Netflix.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,591
Speaker 0: Like, "Hey, what's this new thing on

13
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:44,955
Speaker 0: Netflix?".

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,887
Speaker 1: Oh, they just- they knew about it.

15
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:47,992
Speaker 1: Like, they know about anime.

16
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:49,560
Speaker 1: They knew it existed just for various reasons.

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,624
Speaker 1: They'd never actually watched it.

18
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:54,339
Speaker 1: So they got, like, the Blu-rays and while we're up there, they're like, "We're gonna watch

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:54,400
Speaker 1: it.".

20
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:55,353
Speaker 1: Yeah.

21
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:56,990
Speaker 0: It's on Netflix.

22
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,859
Speaker 0: Why would you watch a Blu-ray?

23
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:09,980
Speaker 1: You know, one advantage I noticed watching a couple things on Blu-ray, as opposed to on Netflix, is there is none of that chromatic banding that you get from pretty much any Netflix.

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,833
Speaker 0: I mean, yes, it is a compressed video compared to a Blu-ray, but you know what?

25
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,540
Speaker 0: You can also just get a pirated Blu-ray.

26
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:16,383
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

27
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:19,840
Speaker 1: I mean, I have a large collection of pirated Blu-rays.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,640
Speaker 0: Which is also usually compressed, but usually, you know, someone, depending on what it is, did a good job compressing it with the right settings.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:35,140
Speaker 1: All I'm gonna say is the Blu-ray Utena collection that I have, every episode is a ridiculously large file.

30
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't compress it, sure.

31
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,640
Speaker 0: And then, you know, whatever, but go on with the original.

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,875
Speaker 1: But we were gonna have a little bit of dinner before I headed back home and I was like, "Well, let's watch an

33
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:47,336
Speaker 1: episode.".

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,884
Speaker 1: Goddamn, is that dangerous.

35
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:56,260
Speaker 1: It was really, really fucking hard to leave instead of watching the third episode.

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,969
Speaker 1: Notice that we already went straight for episode one and episode two.

37
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,060
Speaker 1: Never underestimate the power of cowboy fucking bebop to be amazing.

38
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,199
Speaker 0: Why would- that's not news.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,491
Speaker 1: I know, I just- I guess I forgot.

40
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:11,688
Speaker 1: Like, when we were at RIT that one time- How could you forget?

41
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,280
Speaker 0: Do you think we made it up when we said it in all these years?

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were like, "Hey, did you ever see cowboy bebop?

43
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:16,636
Speaker 1: What the

44
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:16,979
Speaker 1: fuck?".

45
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:18,647
Speaker 0: You didn't learn your lesson?

46
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,576
Speaker 1: You watched the last two, ten times?

47
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:21,280
Speaker 0: Yeah.

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,513
Speaker 1: And then I woke up from the fugue state as the credits were rolling on episode 26.

49
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,520
Speaker 1: It was now Sunday and, well, that happened.

50
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you didn't learn your lesson the past four or five times.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,639
Speaker 1: Goddamn, that show is good.

52
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:34,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's how it goes.

53
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's been a while since I've seen it.

54
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:38,342
Speaker 0: Yeah.

55
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:43,960
Speaker 0: And it- but the thing is, right, other stuff, right, you know, that's, you know, this is why Scott is so jaded, right?

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,139
Speaker 0: There's so much new stuff, and I watch stuff, and it's like, even if it's not- everyone's like, "Oh my god, everyone's watching this fucking

57
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:50,340
Speaker 0: thing."

58
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,541
Speaker 0: Right?

59
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:53,560
Speaker 0: People are going crazy about, I don't know, Game of Thrones or whatever.

60
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,704
Speaker 0: It's like, you watch that, it doesn't- it's not as strong.

61
00:02:57,646 --> 00:03:05,759
Speaker 0: If it was A+ master tier, then it would have the cowboy bebop effect of trapping you there for days on end.

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:06,741
Speaker 0: Right?

63
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:09,314
Speaker 0: And they're just- hardly anything does that.

64
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:09,917
Speaker 0: Almost nothing.

65
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:13,287
Speaker 1: And talking about anime, like, Ava does that to me.

66
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:16,415
Speaker 1: I don't know if Escaflowne would still do that to me.

67
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:18,180
Speaker 1: I haven't seen that show in over a decade.

68
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,400
Speaker 0: But I'm just saying, almost nothing does that.

69
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,839
Speaker 1: You know what still- you know what does that?

70
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,960
Speaker 0: In any artistic medium, very few things do that.

71
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,240
Speaker 1: Well, the weakest thing that's ever done that to me is probably Ghost in the Shell standalone complex, which I really like.

72
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:51,440
Speaker 0: I mean, the hard ones to measure, though, are movies, because a movie- if it's not a trilogy or something, like Lord of the Rings or whatever, it's like, you know, it's like Star Wars- it traps you there for the whole movie, but it's like, well, so it is just, like, any movie that's 90 minutes.

73
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,587
Speaker 0: It's like, only the really bad movie.

74
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:56,951
Speaker 0: are you stopping early, right?

75
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:59,580
Speaker 0: Even an okay movie traps you there for the whole movie.

76
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:11,938
Speaker 1: It's more, if I encounter it, and I get stuck by it, like, randomly, I was clicking through YouTube, and there was a really long clip of Episode 4, someone had just uploaded, and I ended up watching the whole fucking clip.

77
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,600
Speaker 1: It was, like, ten minutes long by accident.

78
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:17,538
Speaker 1: I was looking for the scene of the twin suns.

79
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:21,640
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, it's hard to apply that test to anything that doesn't in episodes.

80
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:25,046
Speaker 1: Actually, that gives me a segue I didn't necessarily intend.

81
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:26,789
Speaker 1: So, I'll do a Geek Bite.

82
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,334
Speaker 1: There's an animated show that Emily and I watched.

83
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:33,600
Speaker 1: It's only nine episodes long, season one, and it's broken up- How long are the episodes, though?

84
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:34,839
Speaker 1: Like, 40-ish minutes.

85
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,920
Speaker 0: And it's the long episodes.

86
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,961
Speaker 1: They're long episodes.

87
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:44,331
Speaker 1: So, it's basically the equivalent of, like, a 13-episode anime, but the way it's broken up is three sets of three.

88
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:50,680
Speaker 1: So, every three episodes is basically a story that ends on a really satisfying beat.

89
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:54,540
Speaker 0: So, it's like an anthology, and the three stories are, like, three different characters?

90
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:02,920
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's just one long story, but, like, three episodes happen, and then the next three episodes take place years later, but it's the same characters continuing the story.

91
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:12,080
Speaker 1: I never thought, like, this is the show that would get me, but Arkane is the show, which is the League of Legends animated show.

92
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,442
Speaker 0: Oh, that one.

93
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw that that existed.

94
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,093
Speaker 0: What I'll say about it- It's got all kinds of fancy animation.

95
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:19,040
Speaker 0: They spent a lot of money on it.

96
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:26,660
Speaker 1: It is easily the most beautiful animated TV show I have seen in five-plus years, maybe more.

97
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,775
Speaker 0: I mean, you get what you pay for, right?

98
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:42,620
Speaker 1: Well, 'cause it's French animation, and the studio that did it, like, they... You know, a lot of times you see the concept art for something, and it's amazing, and then the thing that they make when they animate it doesn't look exactly like that concept art.

99
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,848
Speaker 1: They simplify it, they change it.

100
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,680
Speaker 0: Still looks good, but- Oh, you mean, like, when you look at, you know, a Yoshitaka Amano picture?

101
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:53,237
Speaker 0: And then you look at Final Fantasy VI itself, and you're like, "It's just pixels,

102
00:05:53,257 --> 00:05:53,398
Speaker 0: bro.".

103
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:59,779
Speaker 1: Yep, or even Vampire Hunter D. Like, that was a much simplified version of how he drew Vampire Hunter D.

104
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,860
Speaker 0: 'Cause how could you animate what he painted?

105
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,892
Speaker 1: Arkane is real fucking close to that.

106
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:07,560
Speaker 1: That is what surprised me the most.

107
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,945
Speaker 1: Arkane looks like.

108
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:13,080
Speaker 1: they took the concept art for Arkane and just animated it directly.

109
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:18,200
Speaker 1: It looks utterly, like, it is so beautiful to watch.

110
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:25,180
Speaker 1: But independent of that, I'm gonna say right now, it is the best animated TV show I've seen in at least five years.

111
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,860
Speaker 0: Oh, that came out in the last five years, or that you've seen in the last five years?

112
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,379
Speaker 1: That I've seen in the last five years.

113
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:31,459
Speaker 0: Okay.

114
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,260
Speaker 0: Maybe more.

115
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:36,732
Speaker 0: So even if you watch something like last year that happened to be old... Yep.

116
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:41,574
Speaker 1: This is still, it is, it trapped us.

117
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:43,218
Speaker 1: This is why it was a good segue.

118
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:43,780
Speaker 1: I didn't plan.

119
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,320
Speaker 1: This is one of those situations where expectations were exceeded.

120
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,171
Speaker 1: We were like, "Alright, let's watch that LOL show.

121
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:49,916
Speaker 1: I heard it's really well

122
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:50,359
Speaker 1: animated.".

123
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:51,908
Speaker 1: We're like, "Alright, we'll just watch it.

124
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,915
Speaker 1: Let's watch an

125
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,478
Speaker 1: episode.".

126
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:57,200
Speaker 1: And we kinda just had to watch the whole thing as fast as possible.

127
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,540
Speaker 1: And now we gotta wait until 20...

128
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,440
Speaker 0: Even though you don't know anything about League of Legends.

129
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,499
Speaker 0: Nope, I know zero about League of Legends.

130
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,080
Speaker 1: I didn't know the name of a single character in League of Legends.

131
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,620
Speaker 0: I also don't know the name of a single character.

132
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,847
Speaker 1: And it doesn't matter at all.

133
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:13,779
Speaker 1: This is just a standalone...

134
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,340
Speaker 0: I'm sure that if you do know about League of Legends, though, it's probably greatly enhanced, right?

135
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,924
Speaker 1: Oh, it is.

136
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:20,100
Speaker 1: You know what it would be like if you know League of Legends?

137
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,200
Speaker 1: Imagine if they may try to think of what would be a good example of this.

138
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,268
Speaker 1: Like, some property, like Prince of Nothing.

139
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:28,480
Speaker 1: Say they made a Prince of Nothing anime.

140
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:32,500
Speaker 1: And most people had never read the book, and they didn't know anything about it.

141
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:33,998
Speaker 1: And we come in...

142
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,775
Speaker 0: We turn it on, and before even the first frame, we're like, "Where's the hair and spear?

143
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:39,477
Speaker 0: Hair and spear.

144
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:39,798
Speaker 0: Time.

145
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,119
Speaker 0: Let's

146
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,240
Speaker 0: go.".

147
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,958
Speaker 1: Like, they show a flashback, and we're like, "Ooh, hair and

148
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:43,099
Speaker 1: spear.".

149
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:46,417
Speaker 1: Or you see a character, and you're like, "I bet that's Akamian when he's

150
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:46,839
Speaker 1: young.".

151
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,879
Speaker 1: You know the LoL people are doing that.

152
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,540
Speaker 1: But I'll say, all I'm gonna say, 'cause I'm only geekbiting this, is it is one of the best animated shows I've seen in recent history.

153
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:57,072
Speaker 1: It is A+ tier.

154
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:04,300
Speaker 1: I'm not saying S tier only because I saw it too recently, and I cannot make that judgment yet.

155
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,440
Speaker 1: Like, we say that a lot when we review stuff on Geek Nights.

156
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,462
Speaker 1: It's too new.

157
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:15,040
Speaker 1: A lot of things that feel like S tier fade to A tier with years, so I gotta wait on that.

158
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,620
Speaker 1: But this was so good that I recommend anyone watch it.

159
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,520
Speaker 1: You need to know nothing about League of Legends, nor will you be interested in League of Legends after you watch this.

160
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:26,639
Speaker 1: You don't even need to know the video game exists.

161
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,151
Speaker 1: It is a fantastic story.

162
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:30,380
Speaker 1: The characters are good.

163
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:32,030
Speaker 1: The pacing is fantastic.

164
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:33,260
Speaker 1: It moves fast.

165
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:41,837
Speaker 1: Every time you think, kind of like with Dragon Prince and a couple other shows, where every time you think the show is gonna fall into some trope, like, "I see where this is

166
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:42,139
Speaker 1: going.".

167
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,544
Speaker 1: Like, "Nope, time

168
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:43,827
Speaker 1: skip.".

169
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:49,876
Speaker 1: Or, "Nope, the plot is acting like the characters talk to each other, resolve the obvious conflict, and move on to the much more interesting

170
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:50,279
Speaker 1: conflict.".

171
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:51,420
Speaker 1: Like, immediately.

172
00:08:53,341 --> 00:09:02,659
Speaker 1: It's like if you took a Blades in the Dark game and crossed it with a fantasy world, and it's just, it's hard to express how much I like this show, and I encourage everyone to watch it.

173
00:09:04,581 --> 00:09:06,940
Speaker 0: Alright, so another anime news, right?

174
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,569
Speaker 0: So, Bell came out.

175
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,020
Speaker 0: We still haven't seen it yet.

176
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,933
Speaker 0: It's gonna be in theaters next year, I think?

177
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:13,435
Speaker 0: January?

178
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:14,500
Speaker 0: The tickets are on sale now.

179
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,228
Speaker 0: There's like one or two days of showings.

180
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:18,760
Speaker 0: I think one's an IMAX day, and the other's a regular free day.

181
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,680
Speaker 1: It's still hard to escape the fact that, even though I don't put a lot of stock in reviews, it's hard to avoid that there's no negative reviews of this movie.

182
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:27,480
Speaker 1: Like, not one.

183
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:37,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've also heard that somebody watched the movie on one of those online film festivals, and pirated it from there, and you could get that pirated version to watch at home.

184
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:51,100
Speaker 0: But I'm sure, shortly after the screening, you know, if you're still not comfortable, or it's still not safe to go to a movie theater, wherever you live soon, when it screens, I'm sure it'll play again at some point, right?

185
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:51,457
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

186
00:09:52,382 --> 00:10:01,656
Speaker 0: But even if that doesn't happen, there will be some sort of, you know, you gotta imagine home release, streaming, you know, boure, whatever, that comes next year, right?

187
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:02,360
Speaker 0: At some point.

188
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,299
Speaker 0: So, we'll get around to that.

189
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:12,640
Speaker 0: But, in other anime movie news, Makoto Shinkai, you know, the third anime movie guy, fourth?

190
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:24,059
Speaker 1: So, we got a poster here, it shows a door with some moss on it, and a reflection of a sky, and a sky with a bunch of clouds.

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,598
Speaker 0: That sounds like a Makoto Shinkai to me.

192
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,755
Speaker 0: So, you know, his uriname was, I guess, legendary, right?

193
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,040
Speaker 0: It was like the biggest deal ever.

194
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:36,380
Speaker 1: That holds up as an S-tier anime movie.

195
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:43,100
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't think it's without flaws, but we did an episode on it.

196
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,603
Speaker 0: We did.

197
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:44,830
Speaker 1: Well, I'm pretty sure we did.

198
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,539
Speaker 1: If we didn't, that's an easy Wednesday show.

199
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,640
Speaker 0: But also, you know, just the number of people that went to see it, right?

200
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,440
Speaker 0: The sales on that movie were just off the charts.

201
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:59,020
Speaker 0: And then, Weathering With You, eh, we did an episode on that for sure, not as good.

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,540
Speaker 1: The theme was muddled in that one, like it didn't really, like the message, it is easy to interpret its message as being a kind of bad one, and I haven't seen any disavowal of that bad interpretation.

203
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,240
Speaker 0: I still think his best work is Hoshi no Koi.

204
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,665
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

205
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:18,899
Speaker 1: If I think too hard about Hoshi no Koi, I start to get a little choked up.

206
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:24,280
Speaker 1: For that short little movie about a girl and a robot in space.

207
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,120
Speaker 0: We knew who Makoto Shinkai was when he was making a short animation in his basement, voice acting it himself.

208
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:40,400
Speaker 1: It's like someone joined Major League Baseball, walked up to bat, just hit a home run, walked around the bases, and every time he comes, every time he walks on the field, he either hits a home run or at least gets a triple.

209
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:44,519
Speaker 0: Anyway, so he's got a new movie, it's coming next year.

210
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,540
Speaker 0: There's a, I guess, a picture of it in those little press conference they had.

211
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,359
Speaker 0: You can watch on YouTube.

212
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,800
Speaker 1: Susame no Tojimari, adventure story, action film, road movie.

213
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:58,540
Speaker 1: It follows a 17-year-old girl from Kyushu, meets a young man looking for a door.

214
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:02,859
Speaker 1: They find a door in the ruins of the mountain and all hell breaks loose.

215
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,185
Speaker 0: Okay, not bad.

216
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:06,712
Speaker 0: At least it's not looking for a door.

217
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:08,560
Speaker 0: and you find that at the end, it's looking for a door.

218
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,378
Speaker 0: Oh, we found it.

219
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, they find the door.

220
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,760
Speaker 1: The plot is they find the kids looking for a door, they find the door, there's a door on the movie poster.

221
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:23,120
Speaker 1: The door is clearly going to be one of those situations where it is both allegory and the literal reality of this movie is my expectation.

222
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,380
Speaker 0: And Yuasa's Inoue movie, I think, it's making moves.

223
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,233
Speaker 0: It's coming along, it's coming along.

224
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:31,819
Speaker 1: You know, I say this a lot.

225
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,320
Speaker 1: Our cup overfloweth with animation.

226
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:37,358
Speaker 1: Like, the last- Not really.

227
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:44,580
Speaker 0: There's only, those three and Miyazaki are like the four big anime movie makers.

228
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,620
Speaker 1: Oh, I said animation, not anime movies.

229
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:48,280
Speaker 0: Oh, sure.

230
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:53,800
Speaker 1: This has just been like an era, a platinum age of animation in the world.

231
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,680
Speaker 0: I guess in some ways, yeah.

232
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,899
Speaker 1: I'd say in a lot of ways, but even now we've got this queue of anime movies I really want to see.

233
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,199
Speaker 1: I feel like there's a lot of Easy Geek Nights episodes once we actually see them all.

234
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:13,500
Speaker 0: That's because they only queued up because they would be once a year, but they queued up because we've been locked inside, not going to theaters.

235
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,965
Speaker 0: Right, but that's it.

236
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:18,180
Speaker 1: Our personal cup of anime reviews overfloweth.

237
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:22,919
Speaker 0: All right, so last news is a sad news, but a huge news.

238
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:36,280
Speaker 0: So, there's a person named George Perez who is, if you don't know, basically, it's not an exaggeration to say that he is the superhero comic artist, right?

239
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:47,599
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, there are other big names out there like John Romita or whatever, but it's like- You look at the art that they put in the article we're talking about on the stream, and you look at that and you're like, "That is some comic book art.

240
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:48,000
Speaker 1: Look at

241
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,200
Speaker 1: that.".

242
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,403
Speaker 0: Right.

243
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:55,279
Speaker 0: George Perez, if you've never heard of him, has been doing superhero comic art since like '70s probably, right?

244
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,771
Speaker 0: And he's done all the big, big, big time stuff, right?

245
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:01,440
Speaker 0: Like, Christ on Infinite Earths, he was the artist, right?

246
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,712
Speaker 0: Infinity Gauntlet, he was the artist on, I think, most of the issues.

247
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:06,198
Speaker 0: He had to stop, I think, for some reason.

248
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:12,092
Speaker 0: Right, but like, you know, Wonder Woman, Avengers, Supermans, right?

249
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:15,060
Speaker 0: Like, all these, you know, huge, huge, huge comics.

250
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:18,029
Speaker 0: He was the artist on a ton of them.

251
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,117
Speaker 0: Just the quantity of his output.

252
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:30,200
Speaker 0: Like, I don't think- If you wanted to own, like, every comic that George Perez wrote or did art on, you would probably not be able to fit them in a room, right?

253
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:39,220
Speaker 0: The dude's basically been, like, you know, doing nothing since the '70s other than, you know, living life, drawing superheroes, going to cons.

254
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,365
Speaker 0: That sort of- That's pretty much it.

255
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:45,120
Speaker 0: It's like, I don't know how he could possibly have time to do anything else.

256
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,186
Speaker 0: Just the sheer amount of output.

257
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:52,160
Speaker 0: And, you know, he's basically just an all-time legend, right?

258
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,546
Speaker 0: But he can also really draw pretty well.

259
00:14:55,566 --> 00:15:02,820
Speaker 0: But yeah, so he was at the doctor because he's old, and they were working on, I think, something in his liver.

260
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:09,798
Speaker 0: And when they were in there working on his liver, they were like, "Uh-oh, you got the pancreas cancer, the worst

261
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:10,099
Speaker 0: one.".

262
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,160
Speaker 1: Yup, that's what took down Satoshi Kon.

263
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:16,280
Speaker 0: No, Satoshi Kon, I think, had lung cancer.

264
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,443
Speaker 1: No, he had pancreatic cancer.

265
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:20,008
Speaker 1: It was a very similar situation.

266
00:15:20,048 --> 00:15:25,480
Speaker 1: They found it, because usually pancreatic cancer has no symptoms until it's way too late.

267
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:29,600
Speaker 1: And by the time you detect it, you usually have a very short time left to live.

268
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,140
Speaker 0: Right.

269
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,820
Speaker 0: Well, I know Steve Jobs had it, but Steve Jobs detected it early, could have fixed it, but chose to do some fake medicine instead of real medicine.

270
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:46,078
Speaker 0: And if he had done real medicine, he probably would be alive now, regardless, because Steve Jobs waited till the last second to do the real medicine.

271
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,944
Speaker 0: He did the fake medicine at the start.

272
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:55,140
Speaker 0: But yeah, George Perez, they found it, and it's already stage three, and the doctors said he has six to twelve months.

273
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,784
Speaker 0: So he's like, "I'm not even gonna bother.

274
00:15:57,964 --> 00:16:02,953
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna, you know, retire immediately and hang with my family and make the most of what I got

275
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:03,053
Speaker 0: left.".

276
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:19,620
Speaker 0: So he posted that to his own Facebook, and it's real sad, and yeah, if you've never paid attention to who this is, you know, now's the time, I guess.

277
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,519
Speaker 0: There's never a wrong time.

278
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:33,720
Speaker 1: Yep, there's so many great people out there and so many cool things out there that the idea that you can yell at someone for having not encountered a thing that you happen to have encountered, that's a stupid thing to do.

279
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:35,194
Speaker 1: If you don't know who this person is...

280
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,830
Speaker 0: You know how many George Perez comics I read and looked at in my life, right?

281
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,937
Speaker 0: And I didn't know who that was until the year 2000-something.

282
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,403
Speaker 1: I read a lot of comics.

283
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:48,532
Speaker 1: I didn't think a lot about who made them when I was younger.

284
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:51,400
Speaker 1: Only later did I think a lot about that.

285
00:16:52,361 --> 00:17:07,876
Speaker 0: It wasn't until at least like, you know, from '82 to like 2006, so probably like 24-25 years of my life, he was drawing comics that entire time and was still drawing them up until very recently, and I didn't know who he was for those 24-25 years, right?

286
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:08,556
Speaker 0: So that's that.

287
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:16,025
Speaker 1: If you didn't see, a little minor news.

288
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:26,300
Speaker 1: It looks like because it was in theaters recently, a whole bunch of young anime fans basically just discovered Macross.

289
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,306
Speaker 0: Well, not Macross itself, but Macross Plus.

290
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:41,048
Speaker 0: It was a four-episode OVA series that then had a compilation movie, so you could watch the movie or the OVA.

291
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:45,312
Speaker 0: I've seen them both, but the memories of them are just combined.

292
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:48,116
Speaker 0: I have no idea what's added or removed in the movie.

293
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,800
Speaker 0: Other than that, they both tell exactly the same story as far as I can tell.

294
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,480
Speaker 1: Well, even worse, my memories are really colored by that information high music video, so those are the parts I remember the most.

295
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,580
Speaker 0: I mean, that's most of it, right?

296
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:04,897
Speaker 1: You can figure out the plot, like all the important parts just from that AMV.

297
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:12,952
Speaker 0: Regardless, either version is excellent, so you can't really go wrong with whichever one you choose or both, right?

298
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:17,180
Speaker 0: It's pretty much the only good Macross thing besides the original Macross.

299
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,719
Speaker 1: Well, you know like Dynamite.

300
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,020
Speaker 0: Macross Delta, Macross Dynamite, Macross 2.

301
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,820
Speaker 1: Dynamite, Dynamite Explosion.

302
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,570
Speaker 1: God.

303
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:26,700
Speaker 0: Right.

304
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:35,651
Speaker 0: But anyway, so they have this Fathom Events thing in the US, which is where you can get things shown in theaters through them, right?

305
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:41,578
Speaker 0: So they got Macross Plus shown in theaters like HD Remaster, I think, yesterday, December 14th.

306
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,672
Speaker 0: A bunch of nerds who are willing to go to theaters went to see it.

307
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:47,320
Speaker 0: I can just watch it whenever I want, I guess.

308
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:49,700
Speaker 1: I think I have a DVD laying around somewhere.

309
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:50,361
Speaker 0: Yeah.

310
00:18:50,642 --> 00:19:00,980
Speaker 0: But the point is, if you haven't seen Macross Plus, and you didn't go to see it at the theater yesterday, you should go watch the OVA or the original movie Pronto.

311
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,186
Speaker 0: It is ridiculously relevant.

312
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:08,899
Speaker 0: Pretty much, it was relevant when it came out, and it's somehow always relevant.

313
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:14,256
Speaker 0: The story that is told there is like still a story of 2021 somehow.

314
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,020
Speaker 1: A dystopia that humanity has been steamrolling toward as hard as possible for a long time now.

315
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,180
Speaker 0: Right.

316
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:29,439
Speaker 0: You know, the original Macross TV series was like, yeah, defeat war with, you know, consumer culture and art.

317
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,660
Speaker 0: And Macross Plus is, you know, capitalism and virtual idols.

318
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,820
Speaker 0: Virtual idols and drone warfare, right?

319
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,659
Speaker 1: Coupled with computer security.

320
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:44,820
Speaker 0: Artificial intelligence.

321
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:54,680
Speaker 1: And in one last news that's only adjacent to this, but I mention it partly because we're going to talk about like anime, animation, comics, gift giving guide.

322
00:19:55,081 --> 00:20:00,880
Speaker 1: And one thing you shouldn't give anyone is Funko Pops because the Funko company is morally bankrupt garbage.

323
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,500
Speaker 0: So it's always been, it's always been.

324
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,365
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but they've gone deeper and deeper.

325
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:08,273
Speaker 1: So this isn't news that they've been doing NFTs.

326
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:10,840
Speaker 1: They've been deep in NFTs for a while now.

327
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:14,600
Speaker 0: Even before NFT, you know, blockchain NFTs existed.

328
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have their stupid vault where they'll like release a figure.

329
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,872
Speaker 0: Well Funko Pops themselves are basically NFTs, right?

330
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:22,980
Speaker 0: It's a worthless piece of plastic, right?

331
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,360
Speaker 0: It's I guess the piece of plastic is at least...

332
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,940
Speaker 1: Ah, but they're extremely fungible because they're so generic.

333
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,500
Speaker 0: Well, but the thing is, you know, it's a piece of plastic, but at least I guess it's made of matter, which makes it slightly more valuable.

334
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,840
Speaker 1: Someone could, in theory, buy a Funko Pop because they like its aesthetics and they put it like on their desk.

335
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,623
Speaker 1: Or put it on their desk.

336
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:47,780
Speaker 1: It's no worse than like I have a little Goomba statue just sitting on my desk at work.

337
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:48,641
Speaker 0: Sure.

338
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:52,940
Speaker 0: I personally think though that Funko Pops are ugly and not cool.

339
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,723
Speaker 1: Really, really like bland design.

340
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:57,246
Speaker 1: Obviously like this.

341
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:05,560
Speaker 1: really cynical capitalist will just apply this to literally any intellectual property to be able to sell this to literally any human on earth.

342
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:20,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like before they had Funko Pops, there is one positive thing which I said when we were talking earlier today is that, you know, before Funko Pops existed, if you wanted like a Spider-Man's, you know, thing for your desk, let's say, right?

343
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,486
Speaker 0: Your options were really to buy like a really expensive fucking statue.

344
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:33,700
Speaker 0: Now those statues, some of them were designed, you know, really in poor taste in terms of especially the female character statues and their poses and outfits.

345
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:39,930
Speaker 0: But they were, you know, crafted very, very well.

346
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,760
Speaker 0: They were extremely fancy high detail statues sculpted by hand, right?

347
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,680
Speaker 0: Painted by, you know, they were just incredible, you know, as works of art and they cost hundreds of dollars.

348
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:59,540
Speaker 0: So, and I guess the only other thing they used to have back in the day besides those fancy statues was like action figure for the toy store.

349
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:00,462
Speaker 0: Right?

350
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:08,000
Speaker 0: So Funko Pop in its way sort of fills in that gap of like, all right, it's not an action figure from the toy store, right?

351
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,147
Speaker 0: Where you can see like the joints between Spider-Man's arms or whatever, right?

352
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:14,571
Speaker 0: But it's not a $300 statue.

353
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:16,534
Speaker 0: You can get a Spider-Man for your desk.

354
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:17,656
Speaker 0: that's a reasonable price.

355
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,960
Speaker 0: It's just an ugly Spider-Man with a block head.

356
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:28,077
Speaker 1: But Funko Pop also does a thing where they'll release one of these figures, but they always do these limited runs and then they say it goes into the vault.

357
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,100
Speaker 1: They'll never release it again.

358
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:38,240
Speaker 1: Because they're trying to get collectors to freak out and, you know, get addicted to collecting these things and artificial scarcity and all the kinds of things that come out of capitalism.

359
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,132
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I mean, it's not any different than like, you know, it's like, hey, you know, Magic might reprint a card or whatever, but it's like.

360
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:49,340
Speaker 0: everyone can tell which one was the first edition and which one was the reprint, right?

361
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,128
Speaker 0: So it's like even if they do come out, you know, make more Funkos, right?

362
00:22:55,609 --> 00:23:00,956
Speaker 0: People can tell because, you know, it has to be mint in box and then you can see the box will be different on the newer print.

363
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:03,460
Speaker 0: So you can tell, ah, yes, that one was reprinted.

364
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:09,996
Speaker 0: You can see that that's the 2021 version, not the original, you know, 2010 version.

365
00:23:10,316 --> 00:23:11,640
Speaker 0: Therefore, it's worth less.

366
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:19,671
Speaker 1: So what they've done now is they have transgressed on so many lines with this one thing that they did.

367
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,174
Speaker 1: They've got their bullshit NFTs.

368
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:22,536
Speaker 1: NFTs are a scam.

369
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:25,560
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone listening to the show thinks otherwise, though.

370
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:32,180
Speaker 1: We both did have to shut down that crypto bro who wanted to, like, work with us on game design, who reached out to us on Twitter.

371
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,980
Speaker 0: That could have just been somebody who, you know, searched on Google and found out.

372
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,667
Speaker 1: Dude emailed me.

373
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,900
Speaker 1: I can forward you the email.

374
00:23:39,923 --> 00:23:40,327
Speaker 0: Okay.

375
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,740
Speaker 0: He emailed you specifically.

376
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,551
Speaker 1: Remember the tweet?

377
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:43,913
Speaker 1: He was like,

378
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:43,994
Speaker 1: "Rim!".

379
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:45,816
Speaker 0: Okay.

380
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,626
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Funko Pop is made because they have NFTs.

381
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:58,078
Speaker 1: They're making an NFT of Bob Ross, the chill painting guy.

382
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,400
Speaker 1: I hope you know who Bob Ross is.

383
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:05,335
Speaker 1: If you don't, you're about to discover a wonderful world if you go Google for Bob Ross.

384
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:07,320
Speaker 1: What a just paragon.

385
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:15,320
Speaker 0: I was thinking about, like, watching a Bob Ross episode and trying to paint on my iPad whatever he was painting and see what happens.

386
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:15,750
Speaker 1: Oh!

387
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,150
Speaker 0: Because I can't paint for shit.

388
00:24:18,594 --> 00:24:19,320
Speaker 0: I can't even draw.

389
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:32,560
Speaker 1: So they're making this NFT, but on one hand, that sucks because NFTs are a garbage scam and everyone who is involved in that ecosystem is just scum of the earth trying to destroy the planet.

390
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:35,097
Speaker 1: There is nothing salvageable on NFTs.

391
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:42,820
Speaker 1: Two, it's Funko Pop, so they've made a bland, tasteless, capitalist, normalized version of Bob Ross as an NFT.

392
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,191
Speaker 1: Three, Bob Ross's whole thing was the destruction of scarcity.

393
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:49,754
Speaker 1: Anyone can paint.

394
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,200
Speaker 1: Painting is just a thing we can do.

395
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:57,519
Speaker 1: He painted for the sheer joy of painting and shared that joy with all of you.

396
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,859
Speaker 1: But fourth, Bob Ross basically got...

397
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,806
Speaker 0: He was also about creating.

398
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:06,760
Speaker 0: He was encouraging you to create art and not to go and buy art.

399
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you create terrible art, you are doing more.

400
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,343
Speaker 0: He didn't sell his paintings.

401
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:13,546
Speaker 0: They're all in a vault.

402
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:18,900
Speaker 0: The company that owns his estate and whatever, they just have all the paintings.

403
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're selling all kinds of stuff.

404
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:24,040
Speaker 0: Licensing deals and all kinds of other nonsense to make money.

405
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,373
Speaker 0: But it's like, they won't sell the actual paintings.

406
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:29,100
Speaker 0: The thing that's actually an NFT, right?

407
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,889
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'll sell you a nothing.

408
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,020
Speaker 0: A word that says you own a word somewhere.

409
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,948
Speaker 0: Well, how about you sell me an actual Bob Ross painting?

410
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:38,750
Speaker 0: The actual one.

411
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:41,940
Speaker 0: You have three of each because you had to make three for each episode of the show.

412
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,286
Speaker 0: Hahahaha, no.

413
00:25:44,373 --> 00:25:45,440
Speaker 0: Not a chance, right?

414
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:55,259
Speaker 1: But Bob Ross himself got swindled out of his own intellectual property and effectively Funko Pop has now licensed it.

415
00:25:56,801 --> 00:26:06,040
Speaker 1: So, there's so much wrong with this that I absolutely have to say you should not be buying Funko Pops because that company is absolutely morally bankrupt.

416
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:08,563
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it has been since the start.

417
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:20,160
Speaker 0: You could just tell from the way it operated from day one that it was just a shady biz trying to take advantage of, you know, gotcha psychology to sell nonsense to sell, you know, to take nerds money, right?

418
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:21,198
Speaker 0: All right.

419
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,667
Speaker 0: Nerds are very vulnerable to that.

420
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:23,511
Speaker 0: I was lucky.

421
00:26:23,592 --> 00:26:25,220
Speaker 0: I was vulnerable to that too in my youth.

422
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,813
Speaker 1: Do you know how much anime plastic I would have bought if from the years 1994 through about 2004 I had any amount of money?

423
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:36,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

424
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:39,119
Speaker 0: I would have learned my lesson, thankfully.

425
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,709
Speaker 1: In plastic garbage.

426
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,740
Speaker 1: I would have wallpapered my house in wall scrolls.

427
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,603
Speaker 0: Pretty much, yeah.

428
00:26:45,783 --> 00:26:48,455
Speaker 0: I just learned, you know, some people haven't learned the lesson.

429
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:49,580
Speaker 0: Like, they just keep doing it.

430
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:52,493
Speaker 1: You gotta learn that lesson before you have enough money.

431
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:53,659
Speaker 1: That's the biggest thing.

432
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:04,190
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day!

433
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,730
Speaker 1: So, because it's the holiday season, there's a movie that, at least as a kid, I loved.

434
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:14,670
Speaker 1: I still appreciate this movie as a holiday movie, but there's a lot of problems with it.

435
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,810
Speaker 1: Home Alone, the original.

436
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:18,380
Speaker 1: So, you know, I saw it in theaters.

437
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,290
Speaker 1: I was a kid in that era.

438
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:21,957
Speaker 1: This is a video.

439
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,603
Speaker 1: One of those Wired videos.

440
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:25,310
Speaker 1: But they have a trauma surgeon.

441
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:34,450
Speaker 1: And she breaks down, very specifically, every injury in both the first and the second Home Alone movie.

442
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:39,750
Speaker 1: Very similar to those videos where, like, a professional spy talks about scenes in spy movies.

443
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:48,790
Speaker 1: She just has a very matter-of-fact and real conversation about what would have actually happened to those people with every single injury they suffer in Home Alone.

444
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,873
Speaker 1: Spoilers!

445
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:52,290
Speaker 1: There is no way they would have survived either movie.

446
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:55,654
Speaker 0: Yeah.

447
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:59,410
Speaker 0: By the way, I think we've used that channel as thing of the day at least once before.

448
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:00,673
Speaker 1: We have once before.

449
00:28:00,994 --> 00:28:05,166
Speaker 1: This channel would be my thing of the day pretty regularly.

450
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:06,249
Speaker 1: I really limit it.

451
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:13,550
Speaker 0: I don't subscribe to that channel on YouTube, but I do intentionally go to it and watch videos pretty often.

452
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,338
Speaker 0: And there are a lot of good ones on there.

453
00:28:15,358 --> 00:28:17,429
Speaker 0: The funeral director guy is very good.

454
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,779
Speaker 1: That guy is my second favorite of all the series they've done.

455
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:21,983
Speaker 1: He's done multiple.

456
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:24,230
Speaker 1: He did a more recent update where he answered more questions.

457
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:34,430
Speaker 0: Also, the person that was a thing of the day, the TikTok dermatologist who I talked about some episodes ago, he recently appeared on that channel for the first time.

458
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:36,698
Speaker 0: Maybe a week or two ago.

459
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,140
Speaker 0: Not even.

460
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,822
Speaker 0: Just days ago.

461
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:39,027
Speaker 0: So I was like, "Oh, I know that

462
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:39,228
Speaker 0: guy.".

463
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:45,430
Speaker 0: It's the dermatologist in TikTok and now he's on the Wired channel answering skin questions from Twitter.

464
00:28:49,953 --> 00:28:56,808
Speaker 0: The experts answer questions from Twitter and the videos where they watch a movie and comment on it.

465
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,353
Speaker 1: There's another kind of video they're doing.

466
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:06,590
Speaker 1: I don't know how many they've done, but they have this thing of "explain something," like some concept, in five levels of complexity.

467
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,322
Speaker 0: Oh, they've done those for a long time.

468
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:21,947
Speaker 1: I guess I didn't encounter them until just now, and there was one, a neuroscientist explaining memory to a six-year-old, and then a teenager, and then an adult, and then a scientist, and then another neuroscientist.

469
00:29:22,548 --> 00:29:24,370
Speaker 1: I like that format a lot.

470
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,355
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the third kind.

471
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:27,942
Speaker 0: I like the first two kinds better.

472
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:29,670
Speaker 0: But anyway, third kind's not bad.

473
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,217
Speaker 0: But good channel.

474
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,949
Speaker 0: Watch anything that's on there.

475
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:33,588
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

476
00:29:34,851 --> 00:29:35,532
Speaker 0: Oh, what do I have?

477
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:44,328
Speaker 0: So most of the games out there where you're building a town, building an empire, building a city or something, whatever, are usually actually games.

478
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,150
Speaker 0: Like SimCity, you can't just go and build all arcologies unless you cheat.

479
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:53,276
Speaker 0: You can't just build whatever town you want as art.

480
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:59,530
Speaker 0: You have to actually play SimCity, raise your taxes, not let pollution get out of control, do something about traffic.

481
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:04,590
Speaker 0: Otherwise you draw a big residential zone, no houses will appear, et cetera.

482
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:08,865
Speaker 0: So here what we have is something pretty amazing.

483
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:09,930
Speaker 0: It's called Townscaper.

484
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:12,719
Speaker 0: All it is is a web page, actually.

485
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,909
Speaker 0: The whole thing's built into a web page for free.

486
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,177
Speaker 0: They must be using WebGL or something.

487
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:18,302
Speaker 0: It's really fancy.

488
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,210
Speaker 0: Maybe the best WebGL thing I've seen.

489
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,810
Speaker 1: Good sound effects, like a good UI.

490
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:22,941
Speaker 0: It is indeed WebGL.

491
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:23,890
Speaker 0: It's pretty amazing.

492
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:31,010
Speaker 0: But all you do is select a location and either click to build or right click to unbuild.

493
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:33,829
Speaker 0: And you could build horizontally, vertically around.

494
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:41,350
Speaker 0: But you're looking at some water and you're looking at some town and you just when you click on a spot, it builds from that spot.

495
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:43,945
Speaker 0: And it just sort of makes intuitive sense.

496
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:44,690
Speaker 0: You're building street.

497
00:30:45,092 --> 00:30:47,002
Speaker 0: If you build up from street, it becomes a house.

498
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,570
Speaker 0: You build up from house becomes a tower.

499
00:30:48,991 --> 00:30:50,797
Speaker 0: You build a bunch of house adjacent to each other.

500
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:54,590
Speaker 0: It becomes like a big, larger building as opposed to a single square.

501
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:55,332
Speaker 0: Right.

502
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,139
Speaker 0: You build something that overhangs.

503
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:59,830
Speaker 0: A big metal support comes out and goes into the water.

504
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:01,434
Speaker 0: So on and so forth.

505
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:06,369
Speaker 0: And you could just build to your heart's content, like, you know, to create an artistic scene.

506
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:07,792
Speaker 0: Right.

507
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:10,262
Speaker 0: Of a town, an island town in the water.

508
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:12,210
Speaker 0: that looks really nice.

509
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:20,030
Speaker 0: And it's a lot of fun to play with and really quite an impressive thing to develop in a web browser, technologically speaking.

510
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,576
Speaker 0: So.

511
00:31:22,596 --> 00:31:22,937
Speaker 1: All right.

512
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:25,925
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, The Tale of Genji.

513
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:27,450
Speaker 1: I'm steamrolling through it now.

514
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:38,310
Speaker 0: It says I've got 20 something hours left and I'm reading, you know, I'm trying to read at least an hour plus every day, which I've been doing since I'm not working or anything.

515
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,421
Speaker 0: So I'm probably going to make it next year, early next year, for sure.

516
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:45,589
Speaker 0: I don't have any work excuse to stop me.

517
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:46,751
Speaker 1: Yeah.

518
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:48,234
Speaker 1: I already picked the next book.

519
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:55,790
Speaker 0: The only thing I'm really doing besides that is, you know, maintaining life, eating, sleeping, et cetera, watching hockey, you know, things you need to do to live.

520
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,976
Speaker 1: I'm still working this week, but I'm off next week.

521
00:31:58,998 --> 00:32:02,950
Speaker 0: And then I'm working on our new website, which is coming along.

522
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:07,320
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much all I'm doing with my days inside here.

523
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,901
Speaker 0: Not working.

524
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:09,825
Speaker 0: Not working for money, at least.

525
00:32:10,146 --> 00:32:11,469
Speaker 0: I'm just getting paid because PTO.

526
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:19,450
Speaker 1: So beyond that, I did appear for approximately three hours at the Penny Arcade Expo PAX Unplugged last weekend.

527
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:22,915
Speaker 1: And I did one panel, Rare Game Mechanics.

528
00:32:22,956 --> 00:32:31,910
Speaker 1: It was basically the final, like, refined version of a panel that we piloted years ago at MAGFest in the tabletop area.

529
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:33,353
Speaker 1: And it went really well.

530
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,415
Speaker 1: I'm really happy with it.

531
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:40,930
Speaker 1: And as I promised, the whole thing was on YouTube with slides before the end of PAX Unplugged.

532
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,511
Speaker 1: It's just there.

533
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:42,293
Speaker 1: You can just watch it.

534
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:44,418
Speaker 1: If you weren't at the con, you didn't miss anything.

535
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:45,782
Speaker 1: Whole panel's just there.

536
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:49,130
Speaker 1: If you have any thoughts, feedback, comment, questions, just let me know.

537
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:53,856
Speaker 0: I got one more meta.

538
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:55,098
Speaker 0: It's December.

539
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,023
Speaker 0: Well, it's not Christmas yet, so it's still Advent times.

540
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:01,870
Speaker 0: And even though I am a non-believing, Jew-type person, right?

541
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:07,788
Speaker 0: There's the Advent of Code, which is where there's a programming puzzle every day from December 1st through 25th.

542
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:13,942
Speaker 0: And I've been doing those puzzles, and I've been making recordings of myself solving those puzzles every day.

543
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:16,749
Speaker 0: I just uploaded the 15th one, because today is the 15th.

544
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:26,405
Speaker 0: I noticed that the more recent videos are getting less views because they're long and probably not exciting.

545
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:28,410
Speaker 0: Just me looking at a screen.

546
00:33:29,232 --> 00:33:29,414
Speaker 1: Yep.

547
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:31,130
Speaker 1: Just looking and thinking, looking and thinking.

548
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,076
Speaker 0: And also, the problems are getting harder.

549
00:33:33,296 --> 00:33:37,410
Speaker 0: Yesterday and today, I had to pause the video, figure out what to do, and then come back.

550
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,598
Speaker 0: So, I think tomorrow I'm going to change my format.

551
00:33:40,678 --> 00:33:44,910
Speaker 0: What I'm going to do is solve it just on my own without recording anything.

552
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:51,770
Speaker 0: And then, I'm just going to make a video when I'm done explaining the solution that I came up with, if I do indeed come up with a solution.

553
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,053
Speaker 0: I might get stumped at some point.

554
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:58,203
Speaker 0: So, check if you got bored with the other videos.

555
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:00,529
Speaker 0: Maybe watch the one from tomorrow, the 16th.

556
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,236
Speaker 0: See if my new format is any better.

557
00:34:03,457 --> 00:34:03,758
Speaker 0: I don't know.

558
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:04,501
Speaker 0: I'm working on it.

559
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,930
Speaker 0: It's mostly for me to solve it, right?

560
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:14,110
Speaker 0: I don't care too much about the video part, but it's not too much effort to just do both if I'm doing one.

561
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:16,138
Speaker 1: Could be a chill time.

562
00:34:16,178 --> 00:34:18,030
Speaker 1: Just hang out and watch Scott working on a problem.

563
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:25,389
Speaker 0: If you want to learn some programming, you could learn a lot from me, who's been doing it for my whole life.

564
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,134
Speaker 0: But also, I'm learning.

565
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:31,030
Speaker 0: Today, I learned about a heap queue thing I've never seen before in my whole life.

566
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,996
Speaker 1: Alright, so it's that time of year.

567
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:37,130
Speaker 1: We have a big queue of anime we want to review, but we haven't watched these movies yet.

568
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:44,264
Speaker 1: So, as we've done on the other Knights of Geek nights, we did a holiday gaming gift guide.

569
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:46,190
Speaker 1: We did a holiday tech gift guide.

570
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:49,768
Speaker 1: Now, it's our holiday weeb and comic nerd gift guide.

571
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:55,550
Speaker 0: So, it's kind of tough to buy something for a weeb comic nerd, right?

572
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:03,890
Speaker 0: Because, if someone just wants to read comics or watch anime, it's like, I guess you could gift someone a year of Crunchyroll.

573
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,829
Speaker 0: That would be the same as giving them money, though, kinda.

574
00:35:09,132 --> 00:35:25,130
Speaker 1: A lot of people really are trying to get their friends to watch things or read things that they like, to the point that a lot of comic and anime and animation gifts are often just, "I'm giving you this because I'm trying to trick you into watching it because I want you to see it so we can talk about

575
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,190
Speaker 1: it.".

576
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,350
Speaker 1: I think that's a thing that happens.

577
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,534
Speaker 0: That's a guarantee.

578
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:31,350
Speaker 0: Let's say somebody hasn't read the Akira manga.

579
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,050
Speaker 0: A legendary thing that every human should read if it's in their language.

580
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,256
Speaker 0: It's like, you'd buy that for someone.

581
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:38,999
Speaker 0: It's expensive.

582
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,184
Speaker 0: The six-volume set.

583
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:41,710
Speaker 0: It gets available still.

584
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,643
Speaker 0: It's in print and it's actually the best version.

585
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:47,350
Speaker 0: yet that's available in English.

586
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,975
Speaker 0: You get that for someone.

587
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,870
Speaker 0: Is that really gonna get them to read it?

588
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:58,806
Speaker 0: Even if they were a fan of the movie, I feel like if you buy someone a comic or book, they're not gonna read it.

589
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,407
Speaker 0: It'd be really rare for that to actually happen.

590
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:12,710
Speaker 0: I do not recommend actually buying somebody a book, an anime, a movie in hopes that they will watch it.

591
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:15,290
Speaker 0: If they haven't watched it already.

592
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:24,670
Speaker 1: I'd say the only good gift that is a book or a compilation, things like that, is usually when you know someone is a fan of that work.

593
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,745
Speaker 1: Say you know someone is a mega-nerd and loves the hell out of Akira.

594
00:36:28,826 --> 00:36:29,850
Speaker 1: It's just their favorite thing.

595
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:42,730
Speaker 1: And if they're also kind of a collector person or don't live in the city and actually have a house or a reading room or something, and you know they don't have the fancy collector bundle of that comic, that can be a good gift.

596
00:36:43,612 --> 00:36:43,752
Speaker 0: Right.

597
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:50,470
Speaker 0: Well, for example, let's say you know somebody has already read all of Sandman, for example.

598
00:36:51,332 --> 00:36:56,770
Speaker 0: Maybe they read all of Sandman at the library, which is a good strategy, or they read it all digitally.

599
00:36:57,511 --> 00:37:04,430
Speaker 0: There's like a big, fancy, hardcover Sandman edition that's out, like box, mega box, fanciness, ultra deluxe.

600
00:37:05,211 --> 00:37:18,590
Speaker 0: So if they've already read it, if someone has already read all of something like Sandman, like Akira, and they don't own it, then it's actually quite likely they're going to read it again.

601
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:22,080
Speaker 0: I've read the Akira box set that I've got several times.

602
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:24,970
Speaker 0: I'll probably read it again now just because I'm talking about it.

603
00:37:25,571 --> 00:37:27,538
Speaker 0: It's the Cowboy Bebop effect Rim was talking about.

604
00:37:27,638 --> 00:37:28,883
Speaker 0: If I start, that's it.

605
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:30,629
Speaker 0: And then I won't finish Telegenji, so I won't.

606
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:37,070
Speaker 1: You've given them the gift of triggering them to enjoy that thing they love again when they weren't necessarily planning to.

607
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:42,590
Speaker 1: And for a lot of people, that doesn't apply as much to like me and Scott, but to like a lot of more normal people.

608
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:47,730
Speaker 1: They do like to have those artifacts in their lives, especially if they don't live in a tiny apartment in the city.

609
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:50,232
Speaker 0: Exactly.

610
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:56,990
Speaker 0: So if you're going to buy somebody an actual comic, an actual book, an actual anime box set, right?

611
00:37:57,551 --> 00:38:06,398
Speaker 0: I think you actually want to lean towards something that you a) know they're a huge fan of already, not trying to make them a fan of something new, and b) they don't have.

612
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,127
Speaker 0: You don't want to buy someone something they got.

613
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:08,690
Speaker 0: That's obvious.

614
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:17,330
Speaker 0: Okay, so the next obvious play, right, is you're buying anime gifts, is you can go get some merch.

615
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:18,741
Speaker 0: Get the plastic.

616
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:20,371
Speaker 0: Right.

617
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:28,290
Speaker 0: It's like superheroes, animes, all these things, they make all their money from merch, merch is out there to get, you can go get it.

618
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:36,350
Speaker 0: But 99% of the merch is garbage, so you should be able to know, you know this person you're buying a gift for well enough.

619
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:40,642
Speaker 1: Are they the kind of person who still puts wall scrolls up on their wall?

620
00:38:41,003 --> 00:38:43,650
Speaker 1: Do they have a room filled with anime weeb plastic?

621
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:45,956
Speaker 1: Do they have busts around?

622
00:38:46,237 --> 00:38:51,350
Speaker 1: You can figure out the level of quality, nature, style.

623
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,909
Speaker 0: Do they have a cork board full of pins?

624
00:38:56,091 --> 00:39:08,209
Speaker 1: If there's someone like that, if someone's got a giant cork board filled with anime pins, then a pin or a collection of pins from an anime you know they like is just a hole in one.

625
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,749
Speaker 1: Assuming they don't already have those exact pins.

626
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:20,050
Speaker 0: Exactly, so if you know the person likes awful merch, it's real easy, just buy them the awful merch for the thing they like that they don't have already.

627
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,969
Speaker 0: It's super easy, just shoo in.

628
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:26,876
Speaker 1: It could be nice merch, like a really fancy or limited run art book.

629
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:38,230
Speaker 1: It's the same as the plastic, it's just a different level of cost and like, I don't want to say class, I don't want to make a class judgement here, but a different level of how someone engages with their collector mentality fandom.

630
00:39:39,051 --> 00:39:49,210
Speaker 0: Well of course you could, like I was going to say, if it's someone who's not into the cheapo garbage merch, you could go and find the rare merch, the special merch, the thing they didn't even know existed.

631
00:39:50,911 --> 00:39:54,337
Speaker 0: The thing that's merch, but is also a useful thing.

632
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:57,983
Speaker 0: Just the other day I was looking, you know, the instapot.

633
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,950
Speaker 0: An instapot is something that almost everyone is going to want to have in their kitchen.

634
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,650
Speaker 0: It's a very useful, high quality cooking device.

635
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,209
Speaker 1: I love the shit out of ours.

636
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,035
Speaker 0: They have Star Wars instapots right now.

637
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:10,943
Speaker 0: They got an R2D2 one, they got a Darth Vader one.

638
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:12,487
Speaker 0: I'm not even selling for them, right?

639
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:13,790
Speaker 0: They didn't pay me for this.

640
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:17,339
Speaker 0: But if you got a Star Wars fan on your hands, right?

641
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,710
Speaker 0: Well how about a Star Wars instapot if they don't have an instapot, right?

642
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:26,059
Speaker 0: It's like you can get a gift in another useful category of object, right?

643
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:32,590
Speaker 0: That has nothing to do with nerdiness, but you get the nerdy version of it and suddenly you're in business, right?

644
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,599
Speaker 0: They got Hello Kitty, they got Hello Kitty fucking everything, right?

645
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,785
Speaker 0: They got Pusheen, Pusheen everything.

646
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:39,330
Speaker 0: Not as much as Hello Kitty though.

647
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:49,930
Speaker 1: Now what I'm really a fan of, in my opinion and among my set, the gift along those lines that's the best is the one that's either very high quality or is subtle.

648
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:57,104
Speaker 1: Like a tie that just has the anime girl just on it in the center, that's eh.

649
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:59,990
Speaker 1: I'm sure there are people who like that kind of thing, that's not my bag.

650
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:06,841
Speaker 1: But like the tie that's very subtly the nerve logo, but like tasteful, subtle.

651
00:41:07,202 --> 00:41:11,088
Speaker 1: A person who doesn't know wouldn't recognize it, but a person who knows recognizes it.

652
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:12,430
Speaker 0: I like that kind of style.

653
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,989
Speaker 0: A tie clip that has a Rainbow Dash cutie mark on it.

654
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:19,086
Speaker 1: Oh, some Rainbow Dash cuff links would be like an A+ gift.

655
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:21,372
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

656
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:36,490
Speaker 0: So we like that stuff, but there are also other merches out there that are like the exclusive, rare, really clever, perhaps limited, perhaps not merches, usually imported oftentimes.

657
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,105
Speaker 0: For example, there was a big hype on the internet recently.

658
00:41:42,145 --> 00:41:43,390
Speaker 0: There was that Gengar backpack.

659
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:44,385
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

660
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,693
Speaker 0: So something like that.

661
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:50,120
Speaker 0: It's like really high quality, really fancy, really clever.

662
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,143
Speaker 0: There's something special about it.

663
00:41:52,204 --> 00:41:54,468
Speaker 0: It's not just a normal, old, everyday plastic toy.

664
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:04,450
Speaker 1: I mean the best gift in that space is the merch that the person would like, but either don't know exists or wouldn't be able to get on their own.

665
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,492
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

666
00:42:06,993 --> 00:42:16,930
Speaker 0: And the thing is, if somebody is into the cheap merch, like they're just a kid, they love all the merch, even if it's the plastic nothing, getting them the fancy one is still going to work.

667
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,133
Speaker 0: It's just I figure.

668
00:42:18,193 --> 00:42:21,586
Speaker 0: why get the fancy one if that person will be satisfied with the not fancy one?

669
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:22,630
Speaker 0: Why blow the money?

670
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,083
Speaker 0: Spend the money commensurate with what it takes to make the person happy.

671
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:29,470
Speaker 0: The gift receiver happy.

672
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:53,108
Speaker 1: Especially, going back to something you said earlier, for a superhero underwear pervert type comic fan in particular, if they've read all the X-Men, but they have floppies laying around, even if they are a collector, if they don't own those big compilation books specifically, those I've seen, like we said earlier, be a trigger of, "Well, I read all of the original Road of X-Men

673
00:42:53,148 --> 00:42:53,409
Speaker 1: again."

674
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,211
Speaker 0: Because they're

675
00:42:55,231 --> 00:43:08,970
Speaker 1: not going to be getting out their original that they've got in their plastic case somewhere, but if you get them that modern print, they're probably going to read it because they don't actually want to go get out 40 floppies to read that same story.

676
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:15,041
Speaker 0: Now, in terms of collectible stuff, if someone likes to collect things, super easy.

677
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:15,522
Speaker 0: Just get them.

678
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:18,307
Speaker 0: whatever the thing they collect is, they'll always want more of it forever.

679
00:43:18,348 --> 00:43:19,570
Speaker 0: They haven't learned the lesson yet.

680
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,449
Speaker 1: Just like grandma who collects those spoons.

681
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:22,831
Speaker 0: Exactly.

682
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,113
Speaker 0: What if they have learned the lesson?

683
00:43:24,153 --> 00:43:26,476
Speaker 0: What if you want to buy something for me, literally?

684
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:27,598
Speaker 0: Well, think about this.

685
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:31,804
Speaker 0: Even someone like me who learned the lesson, they collected something in their past.

686
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:34,428
Speaker 0: for sure, if they're a nerd.

687
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:36,090
Speaker 0: 99% chance they collected something in the past.

688
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:40,095
Speaker 0: So, if I was going to buy something for Rim, right?

689
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:43,240
Speaker 0: Rim who collects nothing and wants to get rid of all the things in his house.

690
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,262
Speaker 0: You know what I could buy, Rim?

691
00:43:45,043 --> 00:43:48,909
Speaker 0: I could go out on eBay and get Rim a mask action figure from the 80s.

692
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,393
Speaker 1: Yep, just one.

693
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:55,681
Speaker 1: Because I'm not collecting them, but if I had just one, I would never buy that on my own.

694
00:43:56,322 --> 00:44:00,270
Speaker 1: But if one appeared as a gift, he'd be sitting on my desk at work.

695
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:02,115
Speaker 0: That's right, right?

696
00:44:02,377 --> 00:44:05,230
Speaker 0: If I got Rim like a mask Funko Poppy, he'd throw that shit right in the trash.

697
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,630
Speaker 1: Yup, I could hit someone in the street.

698
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:14,802
Speaker 0: So, it's like you could come to me and you could buy, I used to collect superhero cards in the 90s.

699
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:19,450
Speaker 0: If you went on eBay, there are still plenty of unopened boxes and packs of those cards.

700
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,589
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, get like one booster pack.

701
00:44:22,031 --> 00:44:28,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, just get like, it would cost you like five bucks to get like one pack of like Marvel superhero card series 3.

702
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:36,770
Speaker 1: Fuck, I just imagined how fun it would be for about five minutes to take like one of those old unopened packs and just open it and read all the cards.

703
00:44:38,277 --> 00:44:39,050
Speaker 0: I got over that.

704
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:46,050
Speaker 0: I don't want a thousand of those cards, but I would- I thought about it and I was going to spend the money and then I just went on YouTube and watched someone else open them.

705
00:44:46,552 --> 00:44:47,589
Speaker 1: Ooh, that's a pro move.

706
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:50,790
Speaker 0: And then I saved my money and I saved the space in my apartment.

707
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:54,189
Speaker 0: Anyway, so you could do something like that.

708
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:59,570
Speaker 0: Alright, so obvious next thing you got to do when you're done with the official merch is you got to go for the fan merch.

709
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:09,790
Speaker 0: Go to your artist alley, go look at who was in the artist alley at the convention and go to their website, go to their Etsy shop, go to their Instagram and figure out where their shop is.

710
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:11,960
Speaker 0: Right, maybe they have a Kickstarter even.

711
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:25,519
Speaker 1: Just like we said in our other episodes on this topic of buying gifts during the holidays, commissioning art of the thing they like from an artist who has a cool style is like the A+ gift.

712
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,840
Speaker 1: Like that is S tier gifting in the modern era 2021.

713
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,562
Speaker 0: Yep, just fine.

714
00:45:31,663 --> 00:45:36,580
Speaker 0: Or a lot of the artists out there, especially the bigger ones, they know it's holiday season.

715
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,767
Speaker 0: That's their only job as artist, right?

716
00:45:39,288 --> 00:45:41,696
Speaker 0: I think it's a little too late now because it's already December 15th.

717
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:52,440
Speaker 0: But a lot of them, it's like they make specific news designs for the holiday season expecting you to buy them as gifts and they put them up and then they sell out, right?

718
00:45:52,761 --> 00:45:57,320
Speaker 0: A lot of calendars, especially calendars are really hot in November, December from artists.

719
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,939
Speaker 0: So like, you know, some artists, I know they put up calendars and then they sell out right away.

720
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:10,739
Speaker 0: But if you can get one of those calendars and the art in the calendar is the art your gift receiver will appreciate, go for it.

721
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:23,620
Speaker 1: So especially with comics and anime, a gift that can often go well, this is especially good for someone who's a really big fan but hasn't gotten to the point of knowing anything about their hobby.

722
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,280
Speaker 1: Like the kid who's watched a million anime but has never heard of even a single director, like that kind of person.

723
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:46,700
Speaker 1: One of those books that is a combination art book but also history, like a Fred Schott book sometimes, or like a book about the comics industry, things like that tend to be the kind of gift that someone like that might not necessarily ever think to buy.

724
00:46:47,260 --> 00:47:04,079
Speaker 1: And it's not the kind of thing they'd ever think to start reading on Wikipedia, but a well-made book about their hobby could one, help them level up their interest in that hobby, two, edify them a little bit, and three, it's a gift that they would probably enjoy and appreciate but wouldn't have expected or sought out on their own.

725
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:13,120
Speaker 0: Well I mean I think if you're gonna go down that road, right, it's like if you buy someone a big coffee table art book, it's like are they gonna read it?

726
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:14,688
Speaker 1: And they gotta know the person.

727
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:16,700
Speaker 1: Gift giving always comes down to knowing the person.

728
00:47:18,042 --> 00:47:30,757
Speaker 1: I, in my life until I moved to the city, loved the shit out of giant history coffee books with giant photos, like here's a coffee table book of tanks made in 1939.

729
00:47:30,757 --> 00:47:31,798
Speaker 1: I just lived for that shit.

730
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,386
Speaker 1: But now I don't want anything like that in my life.

731
00:47:35,426 --> 00:47:39,500
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get rid of every physical book I own except for a handful of very important or sentimental ones.

732
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:59,720
Speaker 0: But actually in comics specifically, we did an episode of magazines recently talking about how a lot of them these days are just full of ads and whatnot, and there are still plenty of magazines just like that, but there are also magazines that are very informational deep dives, big long interviews, that sort of thing.

733
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:16,140
Speaker 0: And so if you just subscribe to that magazine and have it sent to that person's house, right, it's actually quite likely that that magazine will end up near the shitter and get read, and then they'll learn something that way.

734
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,347
Speaker 0: So make sure, you know, for example, I think there's like Back Issue magazine is one that I know.

735
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:27,216
Speaker 0: It's like a very underwear-pervert-y, deep-diving, you know, I don't even think it comes out every month.

736
00:48:27,276 --> 00:48:29,840
Speaker 0: I think it comes out maybe quarterly, maybe, I'm guessing?

737
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,107
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's a huge thing.

738
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:36,460
Speaker 0: So, something like that.

739
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:37,062
Speaker 0: All right.

740
00:48:38,225 --> 00:48:43,460
Speaker 0: I guess, oh, final thing, obviously, right, is make something, right?

741
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:43,701
Speaker 0: Yep.

742
00:48:43,942 --> 00:48:45,653
Speaker 1: If you can, you just make something.

743
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:46,880
Speaker 1: It's COVID times.

744
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,799
Speaker 0: Better than commissioning, just making.

745
00:48:49,320 --> 00:49:02,999
Speaker 1: It's COVID times, so the gift that I can't recommend but is an A+ gift is if there's an event, like, a creator you know they like is going to be doing a road show or signing autographs or like...

746
00:49:03,562 --> 00:49:05,720
Speaker 0: Tickets to go to the movie that's playing.

747
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:11,640
Speaker 1: Tickets to go to the movie that has the director doing like the Q&A afterward, like those kinds of things.

748
00:49:12,361 --> 00:49:17,280
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't realize those things exist, don't pay attention enough to notice that they're happening.

749
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:27,820
Speaker 1: A lot of comic, anime, animation fans, those are the kinds of gifts that they would never in their lives think to do, and you can be the hero, but it's hard to recommend that during COVID.

750
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:40,060
Speaker 0: I guess the last one that I can think of for now, yeah, I guess I haven't thought of anything else, is we talked about not getting somebody like a comic or a thing if they tried to get them to watch it, right?

751
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:54,040
Speaker 0: But what you can do is a lot of people out there, even if they have all these subscriptions to streaming services and comiXologies and who knows what else they've got digitally or whatever, not everything is on there, right?

752
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:56,180
Speaker 0: Which is why smart nerds like us pirate everything.

753
00:49:57,521 --> 00:50:04,479
Speaker 0: You might have on the receiving end of your gift, someone who doesn't pirate, doesn't know how to pirate or whatever.

754
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,420
Speaker 1: I see where you're going.

755
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, load them up, get them a big old, just go, you don't have to cost you any money, right?

756
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:24,300
Speaker 0: Go and build up some huge pirated collection of stuff and hook it up for them in such a way that they can go dig into it, right?

757
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:26,259
Speaker 0: Be like, but yeah, here you go.

758
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:38,040
Speaker 1: It's every anime from the 90s and 2000s all on a hard drive or every anime from the 90s and 2000s on a flash drive in a Raspberry Pi that is an HDPC.

759
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,019
Speaker 1: Just plug it into your TV.

760
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:39,736
Speaker 1: It'll just work.

761
00:50:40,561 --> 00:50:43,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, I set it up with the thing and you know, it's like, oh, here.

762
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a Kindle preloaded with all the sports manga ever, right?

763
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,254
Speaker 0: And it's like, just go wild, right?

764
00:50:52,294 --> 00:50:53,720
Speaker 0: With the, with the piratey gift.

765
00:50:54,021 --> 00:51:00,280
Speaker 0: And then that might actually, you know, be something that the person will, you know, use, right?

766
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,000
Speaker 0: As opposed to here, I got you, you know, five volumes of One Punch Man because I really want you to read it.

767
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,039
Speaker 0: And then it sits there and then, you know, that's it.

768
00:51:08,221 --> 00:51:08,797
Speaker 0: They never read it.

769
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:09,140
Speaker 1: Yep.

770
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:16,840
Speaker 1: Unlike gaming, because in the gaming show on this, we talked about how like being willing to play a game with someone is actually a really good gift.

771
00:51:17,843 --> 00:51:19,720
Speaker 1: I've seen people posit this idea before.

772
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:31,880
Speaker 1: I don't think being willing to watch something with a friend as a gift that you weren't already willing to watch, except as a gift that does not play the same way with a media you watch as opposed to a game.

773
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,399
Speaker 1: Like don't give your friend the gift of I'll watch that stupid show that I think is stupid with you.

774
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:39,179
Speaker 1: That's not going to go well.

775
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's, you know, it's like, that is my gift.

776
00:51:44,743 --> 00:51:44,903
Speaker 0: Right.

777
00:51:44,923 --> 00:51:52,940
Speaker 0: Well, not only that, but it's like, what kind of friend if, if you, A, end up enjoying the show and you should have just watched it on your own, you were wrong.

778
00:51:53,884 --> 00:51:54,693
Speaker 1: You should watch Arkane.

779
00:51:55,594 --> 00:51:55,700
Speaker 0: Right.

780
00:51:56,723 --> 00:51:57,839
Speaker 1: You should watch Arkane, Scott.

781
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:58,961
Speaker 0: Sure.

782
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:15,460
Speaker 0: But B, if you watch the show and don't like it and you suffer and that's a gift, you're basically saying that like, if that person is your friend and they consider it a gift that you suffered, it's like they're enjoying that you're suffering.

783
00:52:15,601 --> 00:52:17,295
Speaker 0: Are they, is that really your friend?

784
00:52:17,355 --> 00:52:17,758
Speaker 0: Why are you?

785
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:17,960
Speaker 0: Right.

786
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,939
Speaker 0: It's like, why are you willing to suffer for someone who enjoys that you suffer?

787
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:22,416
Speaker 1: Yeah.

788
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:32,260
Speaker 0: Usually when you, usually when you suffer for them, it's like for their sake, like, you know, I worked really hard to get money to pay your medical bills so you don't die.

789
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,379
Speaker 0: Not I suffered so you could watch me suffering and you enjoyed it unless you're into that sort of thing.

790
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:41,000
Speaker 0: But assuming that's not the case, right?

791
00:52:41,801 --> 00:52:48,919
Speaker 0: If that person wants you to suffer and considers it a gift, that person's probably not a friend and probably doesn't deserve a gift and don't suffer for them.

792
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:49,601
Speaker 1: Yep.

793
00:52:50,061 --> 00:53:03,560
Speaker 1: Now, if you have a friend where you know this would work well, the good equivalent of that would be, again, COVID asterisk, depending on when you listen to this, because COVID, like, maybe this is not a good idea right now in the current situation on Earth.

794
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:15,920
Speaker 1: But arranging the weekend marathon of the show is, assuming that it's a show, you know, your friend would watch, especially if it's like a party where like some other people come to.

795
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:25,080
Speaker 1: But if you arrange the time, arrange the place, arrange the food, like make it an event that works and they just show up and get to watch the show.

796
00:53:25,721 --> 00:53:30,360
Speaker 1: That could be a very good gift if it's the kind of person where they would appreciate that kind of gesture.

797
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:35,293
Speaker 0: If it's also, if it's safe, remember, you can rent movie theaters, right?

798
00:53:35,835 --> 00:53:37,320
Speaker 0: For private screenings of things.

799
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,860
Speaker 1: It's not even that expensive.

800
00:53:39,641 --> 00:53:42,317
Speaker 0: It's not even that expensive and you can get your food on there, right?

801
00:53:43,162 --> 00:53:47,020
Speaker 0: So, I don't know if that's a great holiday gift, but it's a good, you know, birthday party gift.

802
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,447
Speaker 1: I think it would be a great holiday gift in a non-COVID time.

803
00:53:49,467 --> 00:53:54,420
Speaker 1: Like, yo, I rented this theater and we're going to watch the Ava movies ourselves.

804
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:54,941
Speaker 0: You know what?

805
00:53:55,042 --> 00:53:57,692
Speaker 0: That's a good, that's a good multi-gift, right?

806
00:53:57,732 --> 00:53:59,780
Speaker 0: It's like, you don't want to buy a gift for each person.

807
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,073
Speaker 0: You're like, I'm gifting the entire friend group a party at the rented movie theater.

808
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:05,758
Speaker 0: It's like, yes, right?

809
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:06,260
Speaker 0: That could work.

810
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,400
Speaker 0: If it wasn't COVID, you might actually save money versus the cost of 10 gifts if you got a lot of friends.

811
00:54:11,741 --> 00:54:11,982
Speaker 1: Yeah.

812
00:54:12,705 --> 00:54:16,761
Speaker 1: Similar along those lines, but again, these are gifts that are hard to recommend in 2021.

813
00:54:16,761 --> 00:54:28,380
Speaker 1: If it's an anime weeb who's really into anime music and karaoke and like they've gone full weeb, then taking them out and arranging a karaoke party at the really nice place for four hours.

814
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:33,840
Speaker 1: A plus gift, not in the year 2021, but outside of that, A plus gift.

815
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,408
Speaker 0: Concerts also, you know, could be related, right?

816
00:54:37,469 --> 00:54:52,200
Speaker 0: You might be able to go to like, not just, you know, oh, the band that did the opening song to your favorite anime is touring the US or the idol group is in the US, but also, ah, the, the symphony is covering the soundtrack of the, you know.

817
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,261
Speaker 0: Yeah.

818
00:54:53,482 --> 00:54:53,743
Speaker 0: Right.

819
00:54:54,025 --> 00:54:56,980
Speaker 0: Or for, Joe Hisaishi is doing shows in Radio City.

820
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,140
Speaker 0: They're all sold out and the tickets are like a thousand dollars, so we're not going.

821
00:55:00,261 --> 00:55:01,998
Speaker 0: But if you could get them.

822
00:55:03,742 --> 00:55:04,449
Speaker 0: That's a gift for me.

823
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:04,812
Speaker 0: I'll take it.

824
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:05,920
Speaker 1: Yeah.

825
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:09,520
Speaker 1: Like your gaming friend, like, oh, some symphony is covering some Final Fantasy music.

826
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:10,137
Speaker 1: Easy gift.

827
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:11,646
Speaker 0: Yep.

828
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,280
Speaker 0: Exactly.

829
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:22,959
Speaker 1: So and beyond that, like we've because we've done this topic on multiple other Geek Nights nights, a lot of our other advice would just be repeating ourselves and really just boils down to.

830
00:55:23,784 --> 00:55:25,220
Speaker 0: I think we did repeat ourselves anyway.

831
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:25,702
Speaker 0: We did.

832
00:55:25,963 --> 00:55:30,120
Speaker 1: But we did have the right anime flavor because like some things don't work the same way in this world.

833
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:34,340
Speaker 1: In the world of anime or passive media as opposed to active media.

834
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,367
Speaker 1: But don't buy Funko Pops like don't like.

835
00:55:37,728 --> 00:55:41,540
Speaker 1: that's just a specifically bad gift considering everything we just talked about.

836
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,240
Speaker 1: But generally it comes down to knowing your friend.

837
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,660
Speaker 1: Like a good friend knows what kind of gift to get another friend.

838
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,099
Speaker 1: Scott knows not to get me the same thing that I know not to get him.

839
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:54,280
Speaker 1: Anything that takes up a ton of space.

840
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:55,578
Speaker 0: That's right.

841
00:55:56,661 --> 00:56:00,056
Speaker 1: Hey, Scott, I got you a ray themed refrigerator.

842
00:56:00,096 --> 00:56:00,980
Speaker 1: It's arriving tomorrow.

843
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,200
Speaker 0: Well, I'm in a rented apartment, so I'm not allowed to change the refrigerator.

844
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:07,979
Speaker 1: I got you the Eye of Vogler.

845
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,960
Speaker 0: Unless there's a penguin in it and it's a mini fridge, I don't want it.

846
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,760
Speaker 1: I got you the Eye of Vogler filled with giant robo DVDs.

847
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:15,551
Speaker 0: Oh, that's great.

848
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:16,160
Speaker 0: I'll resell that.

849
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:16,642
Speaker 0: I did.

850
00:56:16,863 --> 00:56:18,574
Speaker 1: I did eventually throw away that Eye of Vogler.

851
00:56:18,594 --> 00:56:19,620
Speaker 1: I do not have that anymore.

852
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:21,480
Speaker 0: You couldn't resell it for a bunch of money?

853
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,805
Speaker 1: No, and it was not rare.

854
00:56:22,886 --> 00:56:26,380
Speaker 1: I do have the DVDs still, but I got rid of every DVD case I own.

855
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,460
Speaker 1: And every DVD I own is in this giant binder.

856
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,159
Speaker 0: Oh, I did that a long time ago.

857
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:30,501
Speaker 1: Yep.

858
00:56:30,823 --> 00:56:31,849
Speaker 1: I did that a long time ago, too.

859
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:33,459
Speaker 1: I haven't acquired new DVDs since then.

860
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:34,561
Speaker 0: Nope.

861
00:56:34,763 --> 00:56:36,480
Speaker 0: Well, I think I might have a couple.

862
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:40,253
Speaker 1: I did acquire the remastered super fancy utenna box.

863
00:56:40,274 --> 00:56:41,980
Speaker 1: That's the last DVD I think I acquired.

864
00:56:42,702 --> 00:56:44,799
Speaker 1: That was a long goddamn time ago.

865
00:56:45,681 --> 00:56:48,715
Speaker 0: I bought a USB optical drive just in case.

866
00:56:48,795 --> 00:56:49,800
Speaker 0: I don't think I've used it.

867
00:56:50,022 --> 00:56:50,203
Speaker 1: Yep.

868
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:50,567
Speaker 1: Same.

869
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:51,740
Speaker 1: I have a USB optical drive.

870
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:53,579
Speaker 0: And that was years, many years ago that I bought it.

871
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:02,020
Speaker 1: The last time we used it was pre-COVID because it was faster to watch, what, Three Witches or some movie we were watching.

872
00:57:02,341 --> 00:57:05,815
Speaker 1: Because we happened to have the DVD physically available.

873
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,080
Speaker 1: It was faster than pirating it.

874
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:08,250
Speaker 0: Okay.

875
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:10,194
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's about it.

876
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:13,638
Speaker 1: We can stop right there.

877
00:57:16,572 --> 00:57:18,690
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rym and Scott.

878
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:23,870
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

879
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:29,250
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

880
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,197
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

881
00:57:32,317 --> 00:57:36,910
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

883
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,750
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

884
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,890
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

885
00:57:48,552 --> 00:58:01,490
Speaker 1: And the Patreon patrons for this December 15th episode of the Geek Nights Podcast are... Heidi McNicholal, Joyce Link, Eiji, Dreid, Lily, Tenebrae, and a bunch of people who don't really want me to say their names.

886
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:12,030
Speaker 1: Chris Rhymer, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, JustLikeADudeGuy, Kishiai85, Rebecca Dunn, Revu, Medbull, 34 Cowards, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harl, Taylor Braun, TheIronFront.

887
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:17,370
Speaker 1: You hold the key to my heart and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

888
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:22,389
Speaker 1: We're skipping shows off and on during the holiday season as we do every year.

889
00:58:23,351 --> 00:58:27,150
Speaker 1: That'll continue this season, but you'll get a few more shows over the course of the next few weeks.

890
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:29,260
Speaker 1: And we'll see how things go.

891
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,770
Speaker 1: Stay safe out there, wear your masks.

892
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:37,130
Speaker 1: I wouldn't necessarily say going to conventions is a great idea in the near term considering how Omicron is going.

893
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:40,529
Speaker 1: But for now, I just leave you with...
