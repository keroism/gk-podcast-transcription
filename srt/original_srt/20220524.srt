1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,668
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, May 24th, 2022.

2
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:08,889
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:12,636
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:14,246
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:17,560
Speaker 0: Tonight we are talking about game monetization.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,598
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:28,440
Speaker 0: I did not expect on May 24th, 2022, to still be talking about the Stanley Cup playoffs on Geek Nights.

8
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:30,477
Speaker 1: Here we are.

9
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:33,400
Speaker 1: We could have talked about the other teams, right?

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,673
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a thing that we only talk about, you know, rarely, because, A, you know, in Geek Nights from, say, 2005 to 2013, right?

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,620
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, we got out of college and we didn't see so much hockey because there wasn't yet illegal streaming.

12
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:52,205
Speaker 0: Yep.

13
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,700
Speaker 0: It was actually hard to watch hockey.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,727
Speaker 0: Also, we were poor.

15
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:55,574
Speaker 0: We couldn't actually afford...

16
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:59,360
Speaker 1: We could have afforded to pay for cable, but we weren't gonna.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Speaker 0: No, but we couldn't afford to, like, go to New York City and see Rangers games.

18
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:08,180
Speaker 1: No, we definitely couldn't afford that more than, you know, once in a blue moon.

19
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:16,200
Speaker 1: And so it wasn't until, like, you know, 2014, 2015, the team was ridiculously good, like reached the finals good.

20
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,660
Speaker 1: And we were able to go, you know, watch in Bryant Park, at least.

21
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:24,459
Speaker 1: And we had, you know, a source for a few playoff tickets here and there.

22
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:25,081
Speaker 0: Yup.

23
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:32,300
Speaker 0: Plus, Emily got into hockey big and it kind of got me back into hockey because I really hadn't followed it much since 2004.

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,827
Speaker 1: I was never out of hockey.

25
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,538
Speaker 1: It's just my ability to watch it changed, right?

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,253
Speaker 0: Well, I noticed I watched hockey religiously up until the year 2000.

27
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:42,100
Speaker 0: What happened in the year 2000?

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,180
Speaker 0: Went to college, didn't have cable anymore.

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,679
Speaker 1: Watched college hockey instead.

30
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:46,783
Speaker 0: Yup.

31
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:50,420
Speaker 0: I was still into hockey, but I wasn't watching the NHL at the time.

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,300
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, even freshman year, like, my roommate paid for cable because he was watching all those soccer games.

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,703
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:55,743 --> 00:01:56,530
Speaker 0: You had that weird roommate.

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,720
Speaker 0: I'm glad my roommate was silent.

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,346
Speaker 1: He wasn't weird.

37
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,339
Speaker 1: He was just a soccer dude.

38
00:01:59,741 --> 00:01:59,903
Speaker 1: Oh.

39
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:01,080
Speaker 0: He paid for cable, though.

40
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:02,760
Speaker 1: He wasn't strange in any way.

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,083
Speaker 0: Yeah.

42
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:04,420
Speaker 0: He wasn't like Greg's roommate.

43
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,766
Speaker 1: He was just really big into soccer.

44
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:08,008
Speaker 1: That was his thing, you know?

45
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,680
Speaker 1: Anyway, but it's like, how could I watch hockey?

46
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,620
Speaker 1: It's not, you didn't get, you know, it's like, even if I was going to watch it on that tiny cable TV in our dorm, it's like, am I really going to spend?

47
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,431
Speaker 1: Like, you know, my evenings in the dorm.

48
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:24,239
Speaker 1: It's like I had class some evenings.

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,420
Speaker 0: The alternative was either night class or sneaking into a room somewhere to play battle tech.

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,260
Speaker 1: I'm not going to skip on anime club to go watch a hockey game, right?

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,220
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, a non in-person one, a TV one alone when the team isn't any good, right?

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,040
Speaker 1: You know, people might say, oh, a Fairweather fan only watching when the team is good.

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,660
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, when I've had the capacity to watch and the team has been bad, I still watched.

54
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:49,724
Speaker 1: Right.

55
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:54,100
Speaker 1: And I didn't, it's not like I changed teams at any point.

56
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:01,400
Speaker 0: Well, similarly, what was funny is when I think back, I was, you know, I grew up in Detroit, Red Wings fan, because family's Red Wings fan.

57
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,800
Speaker 0: The whole family is obsessed with hockey, like the extended family, everyone, it's a thing.

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,064
Speaker 0: Detroit's one of those cities.

59
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:09,820
Speaker 0: And I never experienced a team being bad.

60
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:18,920
Speaker 0: They were literally great the entirety of my childhood up until I went to RIT and for about four or five years, even after I got to RIT.

61
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,140
Speaker 0: So I stopped watching while they were still great, just because it was hard to watch.

62
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:28,141
Speaker 1: And then, I mean, the Rangers, it's like they won at the Stanley Cup when I was 12.

63
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:28,482
Speaker 1: Right.

64
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:34,060
Speaker 1: So, and we didn't, I think that's around that that's around the time we even got cable.

65
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:42,680
Speaker 1: So even though it was in the area, I couldn't watch that many games unless they were on like, you know, like ABC or something like that.

66
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:43,500
Speaker 1: And the major.

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,940
Speaker 0: I mean, meanwhile, my parents, they were watching Red Wings games where you get tickets for free at the Coliseum during the Dead Wings era.

68
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,939
Speaker 1: Well, my parents had, yeah, like Rangers season tickets in the 70s for like a few bucks each, right?

69
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,180
Speaker 1: Whatever the, you know, the un-renovated garden.

70
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,920
Speaker 0: That was two arenas ago in Detroit.

71
00:03:59,621 --> 00:03:59,823
Speaker 1: Right.

72
00:03:59,883 --> 00:04:02,920
Speaker 1: But I watched, you know, 90s Rangers, right?

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,039
Speaker 1: Which started out about as good as they could be.

74
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,539
Speaker 1: And they stayed pretty good.

75
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,400
Speaker 1: They had Wayne Gretzky, you know, but then towards the end of the 90s, you know, not as good, right?

76
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,719
Speaker 1: Fadin, Fadin, you know.

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:23,660
Speaker 1: And then, you know, when I was in college and the rest of that decade, you know, 2000 through 2010 was pretty much, you know, the time when we did in between, right?

78
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,839
Speaker 1: The pre-Lunkquist era.

79
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:32,840
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, once the Lunkquist era began, that's when, you know, we started having some hope again, right?

80
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,900
Speaker 1: And now we, the gap between the Mike Richter era and the Lunkquist era was kind of a big, you know, gap.

81
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:43,118
Speaker 1: But there was no gap basically between the Lunkquist era and the Shisterkin era.

82
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:50,160
Speaker 0: They went from having like one of the literally best goalies in the entire NHL to having literally one of the best goalies in the NHL.

83
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:58,860
Speaker 1: And then, you know, it coincided with the time where we were able to live in the city and have tickets and now we don't suck again.

84
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,640
Speaker 1: And this is the first time, right, where all of that is lined up, right?

85
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:15,140
Speaker 1: Even though we've been doing the show for over 15 years, it's like this is the first time we lived in the city and we have tickets and they're in the playoffs and they actually got past the first round.

86
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,244
Speaker 1: So now it's right.

87
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:20,940
Speaker 1: So that's why suddenly the hockey talk has increased beyond the usual levels.

88
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:26,420
Speaker 1: It's even surpassing bike talk, even though I did a whole bunch of biking this week.

89
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,660
Speaker 0: We also did a whole bunch of biking and yeah, actually some trouble getting back.

90
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,040
Speaker 0: So on the Sunday, Emily and I went to the Sunday Rangers game and we tried to leave.

91
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,060
Speaker 1: Let's just let's just change the days of geek nights.

92
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,279
Speaker 1: We have a hard time coming up with topics for tech news, gaming, whatever.

93
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:45,140
Speaker 1: Let's just fucking do bike podcasts and hockey podcasts.

94
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,425
Speaker 0: Bike, hockey.

95
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,559
Speaker 0: We could still do gaming, I think, pretty easily.

96
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,340
Speaker 1: Well, it's like we got to get into, you know, specific bike topics, right?

97
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,251
Speaker 1: Start, you know, being like, oh, which, you know, you want to use?

98
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:58,119
Speaker 1: the Shimano or the SRAM?

99
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,540
Speaker 0: What kind of cadence do you like to ride at in different conditions?

100
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:03,860
Speaker 0: The 90 or the 70?

101
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,259
Speaker 1: A whole podcast about specific biking topics.

102
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,859
Speaker 0: We try out 10 different chamois butters.

103
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:14,560
Speaker 0: So, yeah, we'll see how this goes tonight.

104
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:23,540
Speaker 0: We can try to finish the show quick so we can, one, play Blades in the Dark because tonight is a geek night's night, a Blades in the Dark night and a very important hockey night.

105
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,780
Speaker 1: It's the same thing for me, only replace the Blades in the Dark with cooking a dinner.

106
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:34,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, we went a little too hard against the Denver Sisters and there were consequences.

107
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,840
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's a ton of gaming news.

108
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,460
Speaker 0: We're not going to, can't talk about everything.

109
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,300
Speaker 0: I think we even skipped a Tuesday show because of hockey or something.

110
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:42,934
Speaker 0: So, just got right into it.

111
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,999
Speaker 0: PlayStation Plus, I don't think there's that many geek nights listeners who care about this, but gamers care about this.

112
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,760
Speaker 0: It's a useful service if you're a PlayStation person.

113
00:06:55,521 --> 00:07:00,456
Speaker 0: I don't know a lot about it because I haven't had a PlayStation since the PS1.

114
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:10,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, my, what I under, basically all I know is that PlayStation Plus is basically the same thing as like Nintendo Online, right?

115
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:16,540
Speaker 1: Except... You're paying for the ability to like play PlayStation games online and you get some games and you get some other shit.

116
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:26,540
Speaker 0: That kind of thing, but the news is, so they're changing that and they're upgrading it and there's like better plans now, but it's a tiered system, like there's different levels of plan.

117
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:33,760
Speaker 0: So, they just did a, like some sort of change in the membership to add these tiers.

118
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:44,159
Speaker 0: And if you have an existing plan under the old system, you have to, if you want to continue using it or get access to any of this new stuff, you have to upgrade your plan.

119
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:49,359
Speaker 0: But the way they appear to be doing it is they'll pro-rate...

120
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,879
Speaker 1: No carrying over, no legacy plans.

121
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:54,230
Speaker 1: What if you don't do anything?

122
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,080
Speaker 1: Did they automatically pick a plan for you?

123
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:58,100
Speaker 0: I don't know, actually.

124
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,984
Speaker 1: They'd cancel you?

125
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:00,393
Speaker 1: I don't imagine they would cancel you.

126
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,480
Speaker 1: They want to keep getting your money.

127
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,200
Speaker 0: So, we're only, I only want to focus on, because the news here is that they did this.

128
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,160
Speaker 0: There's a new tier, there's good stuff in these tiers and you got to get, you got to upgrade to get this stuff.

129
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:22,420
Speaker 0: They rolled it out in Asia first and a bunch of people tried to upgrade and it charged them basically back rent on their existing subscription.

130
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:28,260
Speaker 0: You got to pay to upgrade to then have the privilege of paying more.

131
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,280
Speaker 1: Was that an accident in the billing system?

132
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:32,530
Speaker 1: No!

133
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,823
Speaker 0: There's a lot going on here.

134
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:37,349
Speaker 0: So, the new tiers are $100 or $120 a year, so like $10 a month.

135
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,520
Speaker 0: But what was happening, I found an article that explains a little bit of what was going on, it took a while to figure this out.

136
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,208
Speaker 0: And no one's 100% sure yet.

137
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:52,696
Speaker 0: Sony won't issue statements clarifying.

138
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:55,525
Speaker 1: People in Asia are posting- That's what bothers me the most, right?

139
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:59,580
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, companies doing shady stuff or having bad takes or whatever.

140
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,520
Speaker 1: But it's like, at least just have the guts to say the truth and give the full information about whatever your evil shit is.

141
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:14,200
Speaker 1: And it's like, it's like, just do that and I can at least respect, you know, it's like, you know, all right, you're doing something I think is real shitty.

142
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,641
Speaker 1: But you know what?

143
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:20,859
Speaker 1: You came out, you said it, you defended it, you didn't try to hide it, you didn't try to not say anything, right?

144
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,666
Speaker 1: It's like, at least I can respect that, right?

145
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:28,920
Speaker 1: Just coming out being like, yep, we are going to charge you 50 bucks a month, fucking deal with it, do that.

146
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,126
Speaker 1: And I'll be like, you know what?

147
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:32,620
Speaker 1: That's bullshit, but respect, right?

148
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:39,300
Speaker 1: Someone's like, secretly like, oh, yeah, we have plans, they're new plans, they're great, 50 bucks a month.

149
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:39,825
Speaker 1: It's like, what?

150
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:40,835
Speaker 1: What'd you say?

151
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:41,380
Speaker 1: Oh, nothing.

152
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:49,060
Speaker 0: So, so one guy posted a screenshot where he tried to upgrade and it said, oh, you got to pay this back rent.

153
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,659
Speaker 0: It was 430 fucking dollars.

154
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, thanks.

155
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,380
Speaker 1: So what happened, but somebody who just buys a brand new PlayStation today with a brand new account.

156
00:09:59,620 --> 00:09:59,807
Speaker 0: Yeah.

157
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:01,799
Speaker 1: How much would they pay?

158
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,361
Speaker 0: They'd pay the normal 120 bucks a month or a year divided by 12.

159
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:16,300
Speaker 0: So what happened was, way back, there were, you could, in various ways, get discounted extensions to the previous PlayStation stuff.

160
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,320
Speaker 0: So people were stacking those subscriptions.

161
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,260
Speaker 0: Every time there was a discount, people would add years to their subscription just to buy it at a cheaper rate.

162
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:33,640
Speaker 0: Because these people, and this is what I don't get about Sony, the people they're screwing over here are not the casual gamers who might not even notice.

163
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:48,440
Speaker 0: They're screwing over like the PlayStation lifers, like the people who are 100 percent invested to the point that they were doing things like literally buying renewals in advance through like 2030 for the PlayStation network.

164
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,480
Speaker 1: I did that for Xbox Live once because there was a deal.

165
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,918
Speaker 0: I mean, if Steam had a monthly charge.

166
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,900
Speaker 1: I bought one early year to save money.

167
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:03,480
Speaker 0: If Steam had a monthly charge and that was something I had expected and like went into eyes open, like, of course, if Steam did that now, I'd burn the world down.

168
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:14,060
Speaker 0: But but if something like that happened, I would definitely be the kind of person who would buy like 50 years of it all at once just to never have to worry about it again.

169
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:20,640
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, this is that, you know, on the one hand, you're like, you know, you think about it in those terms, like why are you screwing over your best customer?

170
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:22,640
Speaker 1: But also you think of it in the other terms.

171
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,980
Speaker 1: These are your worst company.

172
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:27,220
Speaker 1: If you're a company that sells something to a niche.

173
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:27,684
Speaker 1: Right.

174
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:29,440
Speaker 1: And you might think PlayStation is super popular.

175
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:30,320
Speaker 1: How is that a niche?

176
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:34,840
Speaker 1: But it's like the people who are really playing PlayStation a lot is a niche group.

177
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,141
Speaker 1: Right.

178
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,300
Speaker 1: Just like we always talk about how comic book companies are making like 10 variant covers.

179
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:39,641
Speaker 1: Right.

180
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:43,860
Speaker 1: It's like the business is to milk the niche.

181
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:44,263
Speaker 1: Right.

182
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:44,666
Speaker 1: Squeak.

183
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:46,599
Speaker 1: You got those people who care the most.

184
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:55,000
Speaker 1: Squeeze every dollar out of those people, because if trying to trying to squeeze a little bit of dollars out of a lot of people is much more difficult.

185
00:11:55,301 --> 00:12:02,800
Speaker 0: So it's even worse than that, because remember, I've gotten a lot of formal training over the last several years in modern like product management frameworks.

186
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,802
Speaker 0: A lot of it's nonsense.

187
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:10,660
Speaker 0: But the thing that everyone in the industry talks about are is like modern pricing strategies.

188
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:16,380
Speaker 0: And one of the primary pricing strategies is never give anyone a discount ever.

189
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:20,040
Speaker 0: And if you're going to give a discount, it's not a discount.

190
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:25,960
Speaker 0: Whenever a company offers you a discount on a subscription or something, what they're actually doing is testing you.

191
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,160
Speaker 0: They're trying to find out, are you the kind of person who's willing to go through a hassle to get the service and save money?

192
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,440
Speaker 1: Meaning like, well, that's mail in rebate.

193
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,103
Speaker 0: Exactly.

194
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:37,700
Speaker 0: Mail in rebate coupons.

195
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:50,020
Speaker 0: The coupon industry is predatory in the same way, because once they discover that you're willing to put up with nonsense to get a slight discount, they know that you're probably also going to continue to pay for that.

196
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:58,620
Speaker 0: Even if there isn't a discount and they can heap trouble upon you and you'll gladly take it because you care about this service a lot.

197
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:12,800
Speaker 0: So basically, Sony in this case seems to be punishing people who went through the hassle to get discounts and they're basically making them pay back the discount they got if they want to continue using the service.

198
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,920
Speaker 0: And they're also saying, yeah, so if you're a lifer, fuck you, you got to pay or we're taking everything away.

199
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:28,840
Speaker 1: Well, I think the way the coupons, I always thought of coupons, you know, that this standard clipping newspaper style, you know, my grandma, my mom did that a lot back in the day.

200
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,020
Speaker 1: I don't know how much they do it anymore.

201
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,180
Speaker 1: My mom does that anymore.

202
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,260
Speaker 1: But the way I always thought about those was like, there are certain things that at the grocery store where you have consumable goods, right?

203
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,720
Speaker 1: It's not a subscription, right?

204
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:42,360
Speaker 1: Like, say, a Malamar.

205
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:47,620
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, my mom likes a Malamar, but she ain't buying a full price Malamar.

206
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:53,120
Speaker 1: But if there's a Malamar coupon or a Malamar sale, then she's going to buy them.

207
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,400
Speaker 1: Right.

208
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:59,380
Speaker 1: So basically, it's like every time they make a coupon, they're creating a sale, right?

209
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,900
Speaker 1: It's like they're they're pushing.

210
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:10,500
Speaker 0: It's like that used to be the primary reason for products, for coupons, coupled with now they're in the store if they buy even one other thing you made out.

211
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,580
Speaker 1: Well, the coupons are manufacturer's coupons.

212
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:16,000
Speaker 0: Well, there's there's different kinds of coupons, of course.

213
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:18,280
Speaker 1: That's not the manufacturer's coupon, right?

214
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:31,860
Speaker 0: But the coupons also generate data on basically who has more time than money versus more money than time and also make sure that anyone who values their time more than that small amount of money doesn't get the discount.

215
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:35,680
Speaker 0: They only give the discount to the people are willing to put up with the pain in the ass of the coupon.

216
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:39,640
Speaker 0: That is a specific strategy in modern pricing.

217
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,700
Speaker 0: So this is sort of going further and saying, hey, anyone who used the coupon.

218
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:52,260
Speaker 0: If you want to continue to like upgrade and use the new service, you've got to pay us back for all the coupons you ever used.

219
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, who knows, so of course, PlayStation people are flipping out and no one else even noticed.

220
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:04,340
Speaker 0: And what was really funny is the Reddit threads and all the things I found about this.

221
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:19,260
Speaker 0: Nobody really understood it until some PlayStation lifer like came in and explained what was going on, because the PlayStation ecosystem, the people who will pay for PlayStation online is definitely it is a niche in the gaming industry.

222
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,258
Speaker 0: It is a very specific kind of gamer for the most part.

223
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,157
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

224
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

225
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:30,020
Speaker 1: So everybody knows, at least in the tabletop world, right?

226
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:36,000
Speaker 1: You know, still the hottest, the hottest thing since sliced bread is, you know, letter games and Cole Whirly.

227
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:43,480
Speaker 1: And they're they're games that have titles that are a single word that is four letters like, you know, root and fort.

228
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,033
Speaker 1: Well, Cole Whirly didn't do four, but letter games did and oath.

229
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:50,663
Speaker 1: Right.

230
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:58,880
Speaker 1: And the new game is Arcs, A-R-C-S, and they're exhausting all of the typical themes and they're now in space.

231
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:02,960
Speaker 1: And you can read all the designer diaries about this game.

232
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,630
Speaker 1: They're on board game geek and you can.

233
00:16:05,153 --> 00:16:06,360
Speaker 1: the Kickstarter is live.

234
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:07,379
Speaker 1: I guess that's the news.

235
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:07,683
Speaker 1: Right.

236
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:09,320
Speaker 1: The campaign for this game is live.

237
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,820
Speaker 1: And of course, it funded in two seconds.

238
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:11,983
Speaker 1: Yeah.

239
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:17,780
Speaker 1: And the core can see to the game is I didn't read all the details because it's a lot to read.

240
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:31,100
Speaker 1: Basically, it you know, it was going to be a game, you know, similar to oath and that there is sort of a statefulness to it, but a little a little shorter.

241
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,845
Speaker 1: Right.

242
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:34,220
Speaker 1: You know, in the in terms of sessions.

243
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:41,340
Speaker 1: But it turns out that now and I guess the version of the game that is currently being sold or at least promoted.

244
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:41,702
Speaker 1: Right.

245
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:44,200
Speaker 1: Who knows what else will change before it's actually released?

246
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,300
Speaker 1: You know, if it's the final final version or not, you know how they like to edit.

247
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:53,680
Speaker 1: But it's like if you buy the base game, all it does is play the base game.

248
00:16:54,261 --> 00:17:03,420
Speaker 1: And then there's an expansion that lets you tie a sequence of like a handful of base game plays together into a campaign.

249
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:08,960
Speaker 1: So you could imagine like, you know, you buy power grid and you can play power grid.

250
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:18,839
Speaker 1: And then if you buy an expansion, it's like, OK, the expansion lets you play power grid three times in a row and carry some stuff over, you know, between the the power grids.

251
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:22,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's tough because like we reviewed oath.

252
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:36,080
Speaker 0: I like oath, but at the same time, games that have that kind of mechanic, I have found have a rapidly diminishing return on investment unless you actually play them in that campaign style.

253
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,599
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I think that's, you know.

254
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:48,340
Speaker 1: If you think about RPGs, which are more tabletop RPGs, which are more typically campaign, even though that's happening less these days.

255
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,364
Speaker 1: You know, there's more.

256
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:54,320
Speaker 1: there's more of them that are not dependent on a campaign type setting.

257
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:59,540
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, the ones that are designed to have a campaign.

258
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:00,301
Speaker 1: Right.

259
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:07,840
Speaker 1: It's like even if you played some good DND or, you know, you know, any place in place in the dark.

260
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:08,163
Speaker 1: Right.

261
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:09,640
Speaker 1: It's like it's meant to be a campaign.

262
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,760
Speaker 1: If you just play the one session, it could be good.

263
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:19,180
Speaker 1: You could have a good one session, but a lot of the mechanics like it don't ever get used in the one session.

264
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:20,166
Speaker 1: Right.

265
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:20,530
Speaker 1: Yeah.

266
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:21,520
Speaker 1: Free market.

267
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,100
Speaker 1: It's like that's a one session.

268
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:30,219
Speaker 0: You can't play one session is like, oh, because I'd say half the interesting things I can do in oath don't actually matter to the current game of oath.

269
00:18:31,721 --> 00:18:39,180
Speaker 1: It's you know, it depends, right, because, you know, now we're basically you know, we had the the the role playing games.

270
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:48,640
Speaker 1: It's actually kind of interesting because you would think that you would have sort of like these two ends are at the role playing end and the board game end sort of coming together to meet in the middle.

271
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:49,141
Speaker 1: Right.

272
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:58,700
Speaker 1: But actually, what I've seen more is that the role playing games started out historically with more game in them and less role playing.

273
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,440
Speaker 0: Old DND was not about role playing.

274
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,700
Speaker 0: It was about getting gold out of a dungeon.

275
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:03,823
Speaker 1: Right.

276
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:07,760
Speaker 1: The old tabletop RPGs were closer to war games.

277
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:13,820
Speaker 1: And they moved towards the role playing side and away from the mechanical board game side.

278
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,980
Speaker 1: And now the board games, which weren't even trying to be role playing in any way, shape or form, they were just board games.

279
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:25,380
Speaker 1: We're now seeing those move towards the role playing side.

280
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:38,840
Speaker 0: And I think part of what this works to towards the storytelling and away from the competitive mechanical ortho game aspects, I have noticed that there is a big audience, probably the biggest audience of role playing.

281
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:48,600
Speaker 0: People are interested in role playing just as a broad category who more open games with more social mechanics or fewer like crunchy mechanics.

282
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,960
Speaker 0: I think that's a bigger market.

283
00:19:50,440 --> 00:20:07,219
Speaker 0: But I think there's a huge sub segment of the role playing community who, for whatever reason, either don't like to are incapable of role playing without an extreme amount of structure or they prefer to only role play around the edges of what is primarily an extremely mechanical game.

284
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,920
Speaker 0: And I think I've seen the board game role playing games start sliding very deeply into that niche.

285
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,720
Speaker 1: But yeah, but Arx definitely is going to have a lot of role playing ish type.

286
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hate to say it, though.

287
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,460
Speaker 0: I'm like, I'm interested that I'd like to try it and play it and review it, but I've only gotten a little bit of oath in.

288
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,040
Speaker 0: I still haven't even tapped out the fullness of root.

289
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:38,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, part of that was, you know, how many packs is?

290
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:42,520
Speaker 1: would we have gone to and played some of these games had there not been a pandemic?

291
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:42,884
Speaker 1: Right.

292
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:44,359
Speaker 1: At least eight or so.

293
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:44,661
Speaker 1: Right.

294
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:47,600
Speaker 0: We lost years of tabletop gaming here at geek nights.

295
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,643
Speaker 1: Yeah.

296
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:51,880
Speaker 1: And also, it's just, you know, we're not getting people together.

297
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,181
Speaker 1: Right.

298
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:53,985
Speaker 1: Because people aren't.

299
00:20:54,125 --> 00:21:00,800
Speaker 1: you know, that was the reason I played Netrunner for so many years is because, you know, I talked about a lot of the other reasons.

300
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:01,326
Speaker 1: Right.

301
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:02,260
Speaker 1: It's like play a game.

302
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,319
Speaker 1: People know how to play.

303
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,920
Speaker 1: They show up and play immediately.

304
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:05,670
Speaker 1: They play quickly.

305
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,379
Speaker 1: They play to win.

306
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,700
Speaker 1: They cooperate together to try to make everyone to, you know, make everyone better at the game.

307
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:11,364
Speaker 1: Right.

308
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,018
Speaker 1: The good community and whatnot.

309
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:22,820
Speaker 1: But just having people who want to play such that they prioritize that activity over over other activities in their life.

310
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,120
Speaker 1: You show up on the night to play the game and people are there.

311
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:26,563
Speaker 1: Right.

312
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,500
Speaker 1: And they want to play is important.

313
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,919
Speaker 0: I'm going to play Blades in the dark in an hour and a half.

314
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:31,903
Speaker 1: Sure.

315
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:34,880
Speaker 1: But if I'm like, you know, it's like to try to get people to come.

316
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:46,440
Speaker 0: And play oath is, you know, it's not quite pulling teeth, but it's like, oh, it's a weird problem for me because I would come over to your apartment to play like Maria or Rude or pretty much any of these other games.

317
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:54,119
Speaker 0: But I don't feel that compelled to play oath because I don't expect that we would play five games with the exact same people.

318
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:59,480
Speaker 1: Because you find five people who are dedicated and then do well.

319
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:00,546
Speaker 1: Right.

320
00:22:00,949 --> 00:22:02,139
Speaker 0: There are five people who live here.

321
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:06,620
Speaker 0: And I don't find the experience as engaging on literally any game I got.

322
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,960
Speaker 1: I got Pax Pammer, too.

323
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,225
Speaker 1: We could play that or any.

324
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:12,480
Speaker 1: just, you know, are you going to not ski and come play a game?

325
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,947
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

326
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:13,419
Speaker 0: So all those games.

327
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,680
Speaker 0: But the point I'm getting at is more nuanced.

328
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:21,960
Speaker 0: The games that don't have this campaign or carry over structure are way easier to get them together.

329
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,589
Speaker 0: I'm way more willing to prioritize them over a game like oath where I don't.

330
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,380
Speaker 0: even if I did get people together, I don't expect it would happen in person.

331
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:35,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm considering it, you know, when this, you know, less pandemic ish.

332
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,020
Speaker 1: Right.

333
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:47,580
Speaker 1: I think I might attempt again to not not find a public gaming group, but like, you know, find and hand craft some, you know, possibly people who are currently strangers.

334
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:48,521
Speaker 0: Right.

335
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:56,200
Speaker 0: Oh, I know the people who ran the pretty good board gaming group that was in the beer hall here right before covid and then covid came and it died.

336
00:22:56,521 --> 00:23:02,500
Speaker 1: But actually, I'm looking for people who are like, you know, going to approach board games the way that the people I played Netrunner with.

337
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:02,763
Speaker 1: Right.

338
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:04,140
Speaker 1: It's like they'll play games.

339
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,904
Speaker 1: They'll play quickly.

340
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:07,280
Speaker 1: They're coming to play as their primary goal.

341
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,859
Speaker 0: Oh, these these people are like that.

342
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,779
Speaker 0: It's a lot like when like you me and some of our packs friends sit down at the table and just immediately play a game.

343
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:14,662
Speaker 1: Yeah.

344
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:15,126
Speaker 1: Yeah.

345
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:16,560
Speaker 1: I just said, you know, I'm going to try to fight.

346
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,240
Speaker 1: There are plenty of nerds in this area, like tons of them.

347
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:19,524
Speaker 1: Right.

348
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:20,719
Speaker 1: They're out there.

349
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,619
Speaker 1: I just, you know, go and find these people.

350
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:31,020
Speaker 0: So, of course, the pandemic is making that hard because the one thing tabletop games, not easy to play outside, even in the best of.

351
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,848
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

352
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,859
Speaker 1: It depends on the game.

353
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,739
Speaker 0: It depends almost not except card games.

354
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:36,880
Speaker 1: Hive is good outside.

355
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,755
Speaker 0: Hive works OK.

356
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:37,960
Speaker 0: Yeah.

357
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Speaker 0: Toy games, card games, small games, set up a route outside under any circumstances.

358
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:45,860
Speaker 1: It depends on what the game's components are.

359
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:46,523
Speaker 1: Right.

360
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:46,846
Speaker 1: Yeah.

361
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,340
Speaker 1: Play trains on an iPad outside.

362
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:49,383
Speaker 0: Yeah.

363
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:52,079
Speaker 0: I feel like I'd rather just sit inside and play trains.

364
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:54,700
Speaker 1: It's nicer to sit outside.

365
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:56,584
Speaker 0: True.

366
00:23:56,724 --> 00:24:02,820
Speaker 1: What if everyone has their own iPad and we all just, you know, are lazing around in like lounge chairs on the roof playing train.

367
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,360
Speaker 0: Well, speaking of which, it looks like it's your turn in the train game.

368
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,198
Speaker 1: So anyway, we'll see.

369
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,619
Speaker 1: I'm podcasting right now.

370
00:24:08,221 --> 00:24:08,704
Speaker 0: Yeah.

371
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:09,648
Speaker 0: I'm not.

372
00:24:09,688 --> 00:24:12,260
Speaker 0: obviously I'm not going to kickstart this because Kickstarter is dead to me.

373
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:13,799
Speaker 0: And I encourage all of you to delete your accounts.

374
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,000
Speaker 0: But it's already got almost it's approaching a million dollars kickstarted.

375
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,940
Speaker 0: Clearly, nerds don't care about the blockchain thing.

376
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,980
Speaker 0: I'm able to keep using Kickstarter.

377
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,759
Speaker 1: Well, that's what they can't stop them.

378
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,241
Speaker 0: Yeah.

379
00:24:25,823 --> 00:24:30,940
Speaker 0: In some other news, that's kind of relevant to the main bit, as you'll see, at least orthogonally.

380
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:41,340
Speaker 0: So our good friend, Reggie, always well, not our good friend, like the collective, our good friend, Nintendo fans, gaming enthusiasts, good friend.

381
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:48,459
Speaker 0: Reggie always seems a pretty good person overall, tended to say the right things, tended to focus on the right things where we saw.

382
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:50,746
Speaker 1: Reggie's not perfect, but, you know, he's.

383
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:50,927
Speaker 1: he's.

384
00:24:51,148 --> 00:24:54,340
Speaker 1: he's at his core, an advertising marketing guy.

385
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,715
Speaker 1: He was, you know, but, you know, he was.

386
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:57,420
Speaker 1: he was fun.

387
00:24:57,922 --> 00:24:59,439
Speaker 1: He sort of understood the fans.

388
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:03,119
Speaker 1: A lot of his things that, you know, you would might blame him for.

389
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,086
Speaker 1: Are he honest?

390
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,660
Speaker 1: He honestly say he has like a book that came out recently.

391
00:25:07,782 --> 00:25:07,925
Speaker 1: Right.

392
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:08,434
Speaker 1: Or something.

393
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:08,800
Speaker 1: Right.

394
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:10,480
Speaker 1: That's why there's all these Reggie stories lately.

395
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,365
Speaker 1: Yeah.

396
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:13,220
Speaker 1: But it's like it's true.

397
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,780
Speaker 1: Basically, it's Nintendo.

398
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:16,699
Speaker 1: Japan is the way they are.

399
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:17,083
Speaker 1: Right.

400
00:25:17,144 --> 00:25:18,599
Speaker 1: And he was doing what he.

401
00:25:18,721 --> 00:25:19,919
Speaker 1: Could within those bounds.

402
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:21,321
Speaker 1: Right.

403
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:36,880
Speaker 1: So, well, you know what it is, I respect, though, that Reggie has a good attitude, a good personality, and, you know, he understands the fans desires, even though he can't, you know, necessarily realistically do what they want him to do.

404
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:39,019
Speaker 1: And he has fun with it.

405
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:39,542
Speaker 1: Right.

406
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:43,340
Speaker 0: And well, there's there's a famous quotation that's actually very relevant to this.

407
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,579
Speaker 0: It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose.

408
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:48,127
Speaker 1: Yeah.

409
00:25:48,858 --> 00:25:49,020
Speaker 1: Yeah.

410
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:54,700
Speaker 1: And, you know, he's he's OK, you know, saying, you know, he doesn't like to say everything right.

411
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,383
Speaker 1: Like I would.

412
00:25:55,443 --> 00:25:59,140
Speaker 1: But, you know, you know, he he says things like it is right.

413
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,420
Speaker 1: He's not one of those people who's just not saying anything.

414
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,620
Speaker 0: So what he just said that's relevant is he did not say that he supports unions like how to be clear.

415
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,020
Speaker 0: I don't give him more credit, but he also did not say he opposes unions.

416
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:14,159
Speaker 0: He did not say they're a good thing or a bad thing.

417
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:21,800
Speaker 0: But what he said was the gaming industry has to absolutely embrace unions right now.

418
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,219
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of talk about why and there's there's a whole follow up conversation, read this Kotaku article about it.

419
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:30,819
Speaker 0: But basically, they're coming whether you like it or not.

420
00:26:31,302 --> 00:26:32,640
Speaker 0: The industry is evolving rapidly.

421
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,940
Speaker 0: They're probably necessary.

422
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:41,279
Speaker 0: And game companies that are trying to fight it or pretend it's not happening are going to lose out like they're the problem right now.

423
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:51,239
Speaker 0: Like, even if you're if you run a game company and you're a senior executive and you hate unions, you're going to if you if you if you try to fight the union, the union is going to eventually destroy you.

424
00:26:53,180 --> 00:27:01,020
Speaker 0: Facts, which leads to the final news here, Raven Software, the QA workers, their union vote succeeded.

425
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:01,766
Speaker 0: They won.

426
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,800
Speaker 0: They had an MLB vote.

427
00:27:03,842 --> 00:27:04,223
Speaker 0: It is the.

428
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:07,900
Speaker 0: it is Activision's first game developer union.

429
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:09,702
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

430
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:15,319
Speaker 0: And Activision Blizzard is not happy about it.

431
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,119
Speaker 0: They've issued several, several fucked up statements about it.

432
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,500
Speaker 0: They're not refusing to respond to requests for comment from multiple organizations.

433
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:30,020
Speaker 0: But yeah, this is absolutely a good thing and this needs to continue.

434
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:36,200
Speaker 0: Unionization in the games industry is super important, despite Activision saying, and I quote.

435
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:41,720
Speaker 0: Decisions affecting entire studios should not be made by 19 Raven employees.

436
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, what should they maybe made by 19 extremely rich white executives who have no stake in the game?

437
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,693
Speaker 1: I don't know.

438
00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:55,920
Speaker 1: It's good for the union.

439
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,844
Speaker 1: Yeah.

440
00:27:56,864 --> 00:27:58,600
Speaker 1: Tough, tough shit for the video game company.

441
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:10,230
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day, what do you got?

442
00:28:11,631 --> 00:28:16,990
Speaker 1: So this article comes from a conservative magazine, right?

443
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,708
Speaker 1: Even but it's not an article about politics, so I'll allow it.

444
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:26,383
Speaker 1: And it is, you know, it's this magazine called The Spectator, which is basically, you know, the way I've always seen this magazine is.

445
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:29,390
Speaker 1: it's like The New Yorker, only conservative and and from the UK.

446
00:28:30,314 --> 00:28:31,060
Speaker 1: And it's super old.

447
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,190
Speaker 1: It's from like the eighteen hundred.

448
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:35,590
Speaker 0: So what is talking about is a site I've known about for a long time.

449
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,717
Speaker 0: I'm weirdly invested in it, but it's a.

450
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:41,910
Speaker 1: it's a. it's not a fake news is what I'm saying, even though it comes from a right wing source.

451
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:42,273
Speaker 1: Right.

452
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:44,370
Speaker 1: It's more like something you would see in National Geographic.

453
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:44,991
Speaker 1: Right.

454
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:52,990
Speaker 1: But the thing that's suspicious about it is that this is literally the every place on the Internet that's talking about this news is linking to this one article.

455
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:58,449
Speaker 1: It is the only English language source that I could find at all about this place.

456
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,010
Speaker 0: I've read if there's been a few news articles over the years.

457
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:05,850
Speaker 0: I feel like every four or five years, someone know those other ones were about.

458
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,689
Speaker 0: So I'm going to get to that.

459
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:19,390
Speaker 0: The other articles I found are basically one paragraph blurbs that basically are just someone discovering that this site exists and going, whoa, why don't more people talk about this?

460
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:20,846
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much the extent of it.

461
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:27,580
Speaker 1: Well, the very scant research that I did, right, is that.

462
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:33,329
Speaker 1: so let's just, you know, stop doing our typical feet around the bush deal, right?

463
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:41,930
Speaker 1: There is a place in the country of Turkey known as Carahan Caron Tepe.

464
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:44,258
Speaker 0: Is that?

465
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,090
Speaker 0: I believe you would pronounce that right.

466
00:29:47,832 --> 00:29:49,415
Speaker 1: And it is basically.

467
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:55,790
Speaker 1: there is clearly an ancient village, city, civilization, place, right?

468
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:05,330
Speaker 0: Art, artifacts, lots of art with the well, well, yeah, we're still we are we are almost literally beating around the bush.

469
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:15,230
Speaker 0: What that art is, but the notable thing is conservative estimates about the age of this site place it too old to make sense, right?

470
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,223
Speaker 1: Like eleven thousand years old.

471
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:23,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, this place is like and that's not that's not some made up thing.

472
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:30,650
Speaker 1: It's like there was actually a human civilization capable of making art and all this stuff or could have been, you know, Neanderthal.

473
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,015
Speaker 1: Who knows?

474
00:30:31,117 --> 00:30:31,260
Speaker 1: Right.

475
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:31,709
Speaker 1: I don't know.

476
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,530
Speaker 0: Some other to put that in perspective.

477
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:40,550
Speaker 0: So forty thousand years ago, modern human like humans appeared like we are today physically.

478
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:41,811
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

479
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:49,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like, you know, when was Rome a few a couple thousand recently, like yesterday, right?

480
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,070
Speaker 0: Rome is like yesterday, Rome didn't fall until the fourteen hundreds.

481
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:55,351
Speaker 1: Right.

482
00:30:56,032 --> 00:31:05,910
Speaker 1: So this place is like, you know, we found like skeletons that are really old, but like in terms of civilizations, it's like this is as old as it gets.

483
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:06,293
Speaker 1: Right.

484
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:08,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's quite a lot there.

485
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:19,190
Speaker 1: The thing is, any articles I've found about like, you know, it's like older stuff are talking about like Gobekli Tepe.

486
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:19,751
Speaker 1: Right.

487
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:24,189
Speaker 1: It's like Carahen Tepe was discovered only, I think, in twenty twenty one.

488
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:31,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, that other site was more well known, but it has from what I remember it as it was there's a lot.

489
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:37,750
Speaker 0: there's been more research on that site, but that site was less well preserved and had fewer artifacts and did not have the extent that this site has.

490
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:38,852
Speaker 1: Right.

491
00:31:38,952 --> 00:31:43,690
Speaker 1: So I don't know why there isn't more in-depth English language reporting about this site.

492
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:50,170
Speaker 1: Maybe it's because of the status of politics in Turkey and people, you know, going there and, you know, doing journalism.

493
00:31:50,510 --> 00:32:05,170
Speaker 0: But I've read one one thing that has been a factor is that this is one of those rare sites that is rare enough to where there are archaeologists who argue that we shouldn't excavate too much and we should wait, assuming that excavation technology will get better.

494
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:13,990
Speaker 1: Maybe, but yeah, it was discovered by some shepherd dude and it's like, you know, it does it in terms of archaeology.

495
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:14,313
Speaker 1: Right.

496
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:16,349
Speaker 1: It's like it doesn't get better than this.

497
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:25,750
Speaker 0: I mean, this is this is at least eight thousand years older than the Minoan civilization, which is one of the oldest civilizations we even know existed.

498
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:26,691
Speaker 1: Right.

499
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:33,608
Speaker 1: If you think about if you think about fantasy archaeology, not even real archaeology, fantasy archaeology in the dark.

500
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:36,610
Speaker 0: This site is older than the cataclysm.

501
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,031
Speaker 1: Right.

502
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:42,770
Speaker 1: It's like a fantasy archaeology like Indiana Jones is like, let's find the Ark of the Covenant.

503
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,329
Speaker 1: Let's find the Holy Grail.

504
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:53,030
Speaker 1: This shit is multiple times older than a Holy Grail or an Ark of the Covenant would be if those things were real.

505
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:55,173
Speaker 1: Right.

506
00:32:55,193 --> 00:33:06,730
Speaker 0: There could have been five Minoan civilizations that came and went in succession in the in the time between now and where this site appears to have been built by humans.

507
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:11,557
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we didn't actually point.

508
00:33:11,637 --> 00:33:17,450
Speaker 1: is this is significant enough that you should learn about what the hell's going on there.

509
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:21,870
Speaker 0: I think they really like penises.

510
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:25,730
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, what else did they have for entertainment?

511
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,567
Speaker 1: It's eleven thousand years ago.

512
00:33:28,391 --> 00:33:30,549
Speaker 1: This is not video games.

513
00:33:31,596 --> 00:33:32,508
Speaker 1: What else did they have?

514
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,113
Speaker 1: They had.

515
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,830
Speaker 0: this is this is a you might think, oh, there's some penises.

516
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:39,090
Speaker 0: No, go read this article.

517
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:39,942
Speaker 0: There's penises.

518
00:33:40,677 --> 00:33:41,090
Speaker 0: There are.

519
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,628
Speaker 0: OK, here's the note to the Stonehenge, one of the oldest things we know about half as old as this.

520
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:50,593
Speaker 0: Yep.

521
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:55,090
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day, much more recent fact, it was uploaded this month.

522
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:08,230
Speaker 0: So, you know, the NES, the Nintendo Entertainment System forget special later versions and the whole Castlevania three thing, but generally it had one sound chip and it was a pretty good sound chip for its time.

523
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,370
Speaker 0: The NES had some really good music at two square wave channels.

524
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:17,030
Speaker 0: You had a triangle wave, you had the PCM and he had the static channel like pretty good biz.

525
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:18,949
Speaker 0: NES games got good music.

526
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,049
Speaker 0: And this person is a very short YouTube video.

527
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:29,550
Speaker 0: They explain how this chip works really simply, like they show all the sounds and then they point something out that a lot of people don't realize.

528
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:44,190
Speaker 0: I didn't realize this, the imperfections of that chip, not the limitations of how the audio was generated and how it could have been used by an NES, but the limitations of the specific implementation of that chip itself.

529
00:34:45,572 --> 00:34:46,147
Speaker 0: So what do they do?

530
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:52,768
Speaker 0: They redesigned the chip to function identically to how the NES would have used it.

531
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:57,770
Speaker 0: But one by one, they fix all of the problems with that chip.

532
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:58,770
Speaker 0: And guess what?

533
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,269
Speaker 0: NES music through it just sounds better.

534
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,934
Speaker 1: Well, but I mean, what's?

535
00:35:05,054 --> 00:35:10,970
Speaker 1: that seems kind of meh when you can think about like the Castlevania three, which just had the better sound chip.

536
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just had a different, better sound chip.

537
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's more, that seems like a better idea to me.

538
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,330
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, it is a better idea.

539
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:23,702
Speaker 0: This is more, the cool part of it is theoretically you could crack, you could put this into an emulator and have an option to hear.

540
00:35:23,782 --> 00:35:27,770
Speaker 0: like, what would the sound sound like if there weren't all these artifacting errors happening?

541
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:36,690
Speaker 0: In the NES, because a lot of the music that was written for the NES didn't necessarily use those, that artifacting on purpose to achieve any particular effect.

542
00:35:36,991 --> 00:35:48,130
Speaker 0: It was just a side effect of how the music was made, but it also gave the capability to make new music that actually works better with this chip.

543
00:35:48,431 --> 00:35:53,710
Speaker 0: And I don't want to, like, you can watch the video, it's short and it explains in detail every single thing they did.

544
00:35:54,011 --> 00:36:00,430
Speaker 0: And it starts with the stepper that's making those triangle waves, now they aren't actually triangle waves, they're kind of broken.

545
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,049
Speaker 0: And that's the first thing they fix.

546
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,210
Speaker 0: And then it just goes deeper and deeper and deeper.

547
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,350
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is Ninefox Gambit.

548
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:22,570
Speaker 0: It's, I think I've said this a bunch of times, but I don't want to belabor the point, it is about violent calendars and I really enjoy it and I'm very nearly done with it.

549
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:30,210
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I'm going to be done with it by the end of this weekend, so I'd say the next Thursday episode we do, we should just do the Book Club book on it.

550
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,188
Speaker 0: You should start reading it.

551
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:33,070
Speaker 0: It'll probably only take you like a week to read it.

552
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,829
Speaker 0: It's a fast read.

553
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:37,389
Speaker 1: I mean, I read the whole thing a while ago.

554
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:40,040
Speaker 0: Yeah.

555
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,309
Speaker 0: Otherwise, obviously, we have no conventions coming up.

556
00:36:43,573 --> 00:36:45,210
Speaker 1: Website progress is coming along.

557
00:36:45,350 --> 00:37:03,270
Speaker 1: I'm working on a feature to where, let me know out there, listener, right, what podcast player you use, because there are features in their RSS feed features and there are ID3 tag features that allow me to put chapters in podcasts.

558
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,650
Speaker 1: So like you could skip straight to Thing of the Day more easily, for example.

559
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,697
Speaker 1: Right.

560
00:37:07,717 --> 00:37:09,230
Speaker 1: And I am going to implement.

561
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:16,669
Speaker 1: I'm going to try to implement both of those in a way that works somehow, but obviously only some things are going to support it.

562
00:37:17,993 --> 00:37:20,130
Speaker 1: So, you know, I want to see how worthwhile it is.

563
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,250
Speaker 1: You know, we only have one listener.

564
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:33,350
Speaker 1: I got to know if that one listener doesn't use a podcast app where that will do anything, or at least if you let me know what app it is, I can research, like, you know, what that app supports and try to implement.

565
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,406
Speaker 0: The listener just pointed out in the chat, even Sieve only starts in 4000 B.C.

566
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:39,893
Speaker 1: That's true.

567
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:40,838
Speaker 1: Very, very apt listener.

568
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:55,730
Speaker 1: A plus that listener is probably smart and uses a high quality podcast app that will support chapters, which I should finish programming as soon as the weather is not good enough for the hockey ends.

569
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,870
Speaker 0: The funny thing is the weather, not great today, but hockey in the dark.

570
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,438
Speaker 0: So, yeah, anyway, I think that's all the matter.

571
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:08,710
Speaker 0: we got for a while about check out our discord, check out our forum, check out our live streams.

572
00:38:09,014 --> 00:38:10,170
Speaker 0: The listeners just chatting here.

573
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,170
Speaker 0: I just said words that were fed to me via the listener.

574
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:14,530
Speaker 0: That happens occasionally.

575
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:24,008
Speaker 0: And yeah, we're online doing stuff and you'll see us doing more and more stuff as time goes on and it's nice out and we'll leave it at that.

576
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:24,730
Speaker 0: so we don't shit talk.

577
00:38:25,692 --> 00:38:27,146
Speaker 0: So let's dive right into it.

578
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:32,150
Speaker 0: We've I can't believe we've never actually done a geek nights episode on this topic.

579
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,087
Speaker 1: We've talked about this topic so much.

580
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:37,110
Speaker 1: News is and other, you know, opening bits.

581
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:42,570
Speaker 0: We've done three separate panels that touch on aspects of this area in the past.

582
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,070
Speaker 0: We did one on like a panel on like how to make money making games.

583
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:48,929
Speaker 1: We're doing that geek nights thing again where we don't say what the thing is.

584
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,269
Speaker 1: We're talking about making money by selling games.

585
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:52,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, somehow.

586
00:38:53,470 --> 00:39:02,050
Speaker 0: So I'll link to our old lectures because they cover a lot of ground here, but I think one, we can't go too, too deep on a lot of the details tonight or we'll run into hockey.

587
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:04,790
Speaker 0: And those are those are future shows.

588
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,910
Speaker 0: We just be cannibalizing.

589
00:39:06,231 --> 00:39:09,237
Speaker 0: But two, I think we should focus on.

590
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:15,430
Speaker 0: let's not talk about the before money of how you get money to even make a game and just talk about, say, you've got a game.

591
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:20,430
Speaker 0: How the hell do you make money from it rather to recoup your costs to whatever?

592
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,289
Speaker 0: Just how do you make money?

593
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:21,950
Speaker 0: I'm assuming so.

594
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,330
Speaker 1: We live in a capitalist society, right?

595
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,469
Speaker 1: You need money to live.

596
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:30,950
Speaker 1: If you spend your time making a game, video game, tabletop game, role playing game, any kind of game.

597
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:33,369
Speaker 1: You spend your time on that.

598
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:47,230
Speaker 1: You might want to recoup your investment of time, resources, et cetera, in the form of money and maybe even do that well enough or enough to not have to do some other job.

599
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:48,133
Speaker 1: And that could be.

600
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:49,498
Speaker 1: your only job is do.

601
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:53,170
Speaker 1: it is converting your time and effort into games and turning those into money.

602
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:59,430
Speaker 1: And there are so many different ways to do it and they keep changing.

603
00:40:00,151 --> 00:40:21,910
Speaker 1: And the laws around doing it and just the structure of our society and everything makes it like this unique situation where that that type of work does is like different from a lot of other types of work, even other types of entertainment work, like making music or making movies, even though there are some similarities.

604
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:34,690
Speaker 0: There are a lot of similarities, but the industries are structured differently in, honestly, extremely toxic ways that make gaming this perfect storm of problems because a lot of movies fail to make their money back.

605
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:40,710
Speaker 0: But there's all their revenue streams and stuff that happens like the movie industry is structured very differently.

606
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:53,410
Speaker 0: But games, even if we just talked about video games, let alone tabletop, I'd say ninety nine point nine percent of all games that ever made make do not even make back the money it took to make them.

607
00:40:54,198 --> 00:40:54,729
Speaker 1: Probably not.

608
00:40:55,851 --> 00:41:07,170
Speaker 0: And I struggle as a professional product manager in capital markets to figure out if it's even possible to make money from the vast majority of games.

609
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:11,670
Speaker 0: Regardless of the quality of those games, there are games that make a lot of money.

610
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:12,830
Speaker 0: They are rare.

611
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:17,490
Speaker 0: They're usually well supported and the margins are probably not even that big.

612
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:21,210
Speaker 0: There's a handful of games that have, you know, they get some sort of cult status.

613
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:25,150
Speaker 0: The algorithm promotes them and they sell way higher than anyone expected.

614
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:27,930
Speaker 0: But those are black swan events that are so rare.

615
00:41:28,011 --> 00:41:29,390
Speaker 0: They're almost not worth talking about.

616
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:31,029
Speaker 0: So what do we do?

617
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,069
Speaker 0: What are we at a game?

618
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,950
Speaker 0: You Scott and I made it advanced train wars.

619
00:41:35,153 --> 00:41:36,089
Speaker 0: We made some game.

620
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:38,129
Speaker 0: It's it's a video game.

621
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:39,990
Speaker 0: It can run on any platform.

622
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,708
Speaker 0: Let's say we are like it's already done, ready to go.

623
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:43,749
Speaker 1: What do I do?

624
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:52,870
Speaker 1: Well, the first issue is that unlike other forms of artwork, is that copyright law only partially applies, right?

625
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:59,690
Speaker 1: It's like any music or art or other sorts of things you make for the game are protected by copyright law.

626
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:04,690
Speaker 1: And so, you know, other people couldn't steal those things, at least legally.

627
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:06,128
Speaker 1: We could try to sue them if they did.

628
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:10,450
Speaker 1: But the actual rules of the game, right?

629
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:12,890
Speaker 1: We could try to patent them, I guess.

630
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:13,302
Speaker 1: Right.

631
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,249
Speaker 0: You know, yeah, that gets into dicey.

632
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,869
Speaker 0: A few game companies have tried that crap over the years, but it hasn't been successful.

633
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:20,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, nobody does that.

634
00:42:20,773 --> 00:42:20,990
Speaker 1: Right.

635
00:42:21,091 --> 00:42:23,530
Speaker 1: So it's like someone could just copy our game.

636
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:25,630
Speaker 1: And this happens all the fucking time.

637
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:25,950
Speaker 1: Right.

638
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,359
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, how many wordles are there or how many?

639
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:33,750
Speaker 1: when threes came out, there was like 20, 48 came out like a day after.

640
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:34,170
Speaker 1: Right.

641
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,150
Speaker 1: It's like, right.

642
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:45,330
Speaker 1: So we have to make our game in such a way that nobody out there can replicate it and do a better job quickly.

643
00:42:45,762 --> 00:42:45,970
Speaker 1: Right.

644
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:54,870
Speaker 1: There has to be something about our game that, like, can't be beat or can't be easily copied, you know, like there's something to it.

645
00:42:55,097 --> 00:42:55,269
Speaker 1: Right.

646
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:59,020
Speaker 0: So it's even worse in that regard because they don't even have to make.

647
00:43:00,062 --> 00:43:02,710
Speaker 0: doing it better doesn't even necessarily mean making your game better.

648
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,749
Speaker 0: They could take your game, make it worse, market it better, sell more of it.

649
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,190
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, so this is so if you think about games, games that are successful.

650
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:11,770
Speaker 1: Right.

651
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:19,550
Speaker 1: It's like every game that's successful is in some way has an aspect that can't just be copied and beaten.

652
00:43:19,678 --> 00:43:19,850
Speaker 1: Right.

653
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:22,050
Speaker 1: So all those FPS is out there.

654
00:43:22,171 --> 00:43:25,050
Speaker 1: It's like, well, people can copy FPS is, but wait.

655
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:35,190
Speaker 1: But the ones that make money are ones that have these, you know, multiplayer communities that are, you know, carefully, you know, administered and whatnot.

656
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:35,428
Speaker 1: Right.

657
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:42,750
Speaker 0: It's like it's not easy to set that up or they're part of a franchise of single player games that people know and already like.

658
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:48,690
Speaker 1: And they think there's some sort of a story or plot or movie with cut scenes that's attached to the game.

659
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,870
Speaker 1: And that's all copyrighted.

660
00:43:50,015 --> 00:43:50,250
Speaker 1: Right.

661
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,010
Speaker 1: And, you know, people have some attachment to that.

662
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,509
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a Star Wars FPS or something like that.

663
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,250
Speaker 1: Or, you know, some new intellectual property is attached to it.

664
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,950
Speaker 0: I mean, if I have like forever comes out, a lot of people would just buy it sight unseen.

665
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:03,970
Speaker 1: Right.

666
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:08,189
Speaker 1: You know, so, you know, that you need to have something like that.

667
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:09,522
Speaker 1: Otherwise, right.

668
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,072
Speaker 1: People aren't going to.

669
00:44:11,512 --> 00:44:21,429
Speaker 1: no matter what monetization method you choose, you're no one's going to pay for the game because it's like if I just put out a really solid FPS, it's like there's a ton of really solid FPS.

670
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:22,070
Speaker 1: is mine better.

671
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:32,829
Speaker 1: Be free to have anyone to choose it if it doesn't have a thing attached to it that makes it unique, better, special, you know, not something every other FPS has.

672
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:33,806
Speaker 0: Yep.

673
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,769
Speaker 1: But that applies no matter what kind of game.

674
00:44:37,032 --> 00:44:37,809
Speaker 0: So let's say we did that.

675
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:38,687
Speaker 0: Our game is unique.

676
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:40,644
Speaker 0: It is Advanced Wars 18XX something.

677
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,038
Speaker 0: It's unique and it's not.

678
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,590
Speaker 0: it's not a complete narrow niche.

679
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,910
Speaker 0: It's a game that we think gamers would buy enough for us to make some money.

680
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:51,030
Speaker 0: Well, now we have to think about it.

681
00:44:51,050 --> 00:45:02,670
Speaker 1: So the first the first way we could try to make money is to literally sell the game, just be like, you pay us money and you we will give you the copy of this game and then you could play it all you want forever.

682
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:04,709
Speaker 1: And some people still do this.

683
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:09,290
Speaker 1: But nowadays you have to do it digitally because who's buying physical cartridges?

684
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:14,368
Speaker 0: Look, I'm so invested in gaming that I have been podcasting about gaming for like 15 years.

685
00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:20,050
Speaker 0: And yet I very rarely buy new games.

686
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:25,289
Speaker 0: And when I do, I buy them in bulk for almost zero dollars.

687
00:45:27,252 --> 00:45:27,990
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

688
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,549
Speaker 1: And the place someone buys them from is going to take a cut.

689
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:32,307
Speaker 1: Right.

690
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,490
Speaker 1: Is Steam takes a cut.

691
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,109
Speaker 1: Nintendo eShop takes a cut.

692
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:35,479
Speaker 0: Yeah.

693
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:37,528
Speaker 1: Apple App Store takes a cut.

694
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:39,470
Speaker 0: You might say, oh, I'll sell it directly.

695
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,445
Speaker 0: Well, one, no, you won't.

696
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,009
Speaker 1: And two, we know it will come to your website to buy your game and download a set up.

697
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:44,929
Speaker 0: All right.

698
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,550
Speaker 0: Hey, you want to you want to buy an exe file from me for 20 bucks?

699
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,470
Speaker 0: Just put your credit card into my website.

700
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:52,408
Speaker 1: PayPal me, at least that's a little safer.

701
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,270
Speaker 1: But yeah, so that's not happening.

702
00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:04,339
Speaker 1: So the problem with this method is that a relative to your development cost, right, you're going to have to charge an amount of money.

703
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:08,210
Speaker 1: that is like no matter where you set your price point, right?

704
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:14,268
Speaker 1: If you set the price too low, you'll never have enough sales at that low price point to make enough money.

705
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:14,583
Speaker 1: Yeah.

706
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:19,290
Speaker 1: And if you set the price too high, well, you're going to further decrease sales.

707
00:46:19,593 --> 00:46:21,110
Speaker 1: And it's like you'll get more per sale.

708
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:29,607
Speaker 1: But it's like that doesn't seem to be a magic number at which, you know, you will make like unless your game is a mega hit.

709
00:46:30,071 --> 00:46:34,890
Speaker 0: This is where any of you got like an MBA and you think you can solve this problem.

710
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:40,489
Speaker 0: You think, you know, this concept of supply and demand because you took Econ 101 as a freshman in college.

711
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,109
Speaker 1: The supply is infinity here.

712
00:46:42,392 --> 00:46:43,330
Speaker 1: That doesn't make sense.

713
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:48,009
Speaker 0: Well, supply and demand demand as a simplistic set of two curves is.

714
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:52,049
Speaker 0: Laughable to the point of being absurd.

715
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:53,933
Speaker 0: The only way to

716
00:46:53,973 --> 00:46:54,494
Speaker 1: succeed,

717
00:46:54,775 --> 00:47:15,070
Speaker 0: the most the most the most true metric is value based pricing instead, where the all the price you can charge for something is dependent solely on how much your customer values, what they will get from that thing, but what it costs you to make the thing is not part of the equation.

718
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:16,210
Speaker 1: Nope.

719
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:27,670
Speaker 1: So the way that and you can take advantage of that, the way to make money on the buy my game for a flat price deal is to make a game where the cost of development was low.

720
00:47:27,891 --> 00:47:28,071
Speaker 1: Right.

721
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:32,570
Speaker 1: You look out there at like the vampire survivors or the spires of the world.

722
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:41,410
Speaker 1: And it's like those can make money just selling the game because they can keep going to new platforms, keep reaching more audiences, keep finding more customers.

723
00:47:41,811 --> 00:47:45,310
Speaker 0: I still play this today, but they don't make any more money for me.

724
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:45,636
Speaker 0: I bought it.

725
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:46,410
Speaker 0: Well, I bought it twice.

726
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,570
Speaker 0: I bought it on the switch, but I digress.

727
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:58,610
Speaker 1: But they but they can keep the cash flow going because people keep finding out about the game, making the game didn't cost nearly as much as making most other game.

728
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,810
Speaker 0: Well, it and it turns into a long tale of revenue.

729
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:05,993
Speaker 0: Like people will just keep occasionally buying Slay the Spire for a long, long, long, long time.

730
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:09,470
Speaker 0: And you don't have to spend much money to keep that happening.

731
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:12,868
Speaker 1: I mean, it does eventually narrow down to a trickle.

732
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:23,995
Speaker 0: But then you do a release tied to a bundle with your new game that you're going to get to new game in a second, because, yeah, that's the only monetization model I'm aware of that works.

733
00:48:24,298 --> 00:48:25,229
Speaker 0: That isn't evil.

734
00:48:26,151 --> 00:48:32,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, but even the the big, big triple-A titles are not succeeding with the.

735
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:33,769
Speaker 1: just buy my game and that's it.

736
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:37,590
Speaker 1: They're all doing extra stuff on top of that because it's not enough.

737
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:37,891
Speaker 1: Right.

738
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:52,130
Speaker 1: And the core problem is even if you did make a bunch of money on that initial, I'm just selling my game like, you know, people have done since, you know, selling NES cartridges and games for, you know, on floppy disks and whatnot.

739
00:48:52,271 --> 00:48:55,630
Speaker 1: It's that you get the money once and that's it.

740
00:48:56,010 --> 00:49:05,990
Speaker 1: It's like when people want to if you have a game studio, it's like you form a game studio, you make a game, you sell the game, you get money.

741
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:13,509
Speaker 1: And then it's like, all right, we pay everyone and we, you know, we pay off all our debts and everything and maybe have extra money.

742
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,849
Speaker 1: And it's like, do you want to keep making games?

743
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:20,908
Speaker 1: Well, that you just you only got like it was like winning the lottery lump sum.

744
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:21,955
Speaker 1: Right.

745
00:49:21,975 --> 00:49:23,270
Speaker 1: It's like that's it.

746
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:26,210
Speaker 1: You want it to have a sustainable business, right?

747
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,570
Speaker 1: Like a grocery store.

748
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:29,550
Speaker 1: It's like cash flow is constant.

749
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,708
Speaker 1: It's always coming in.

750
00:49:31,191 --> 00:49:32,015
Speaker 1: You can't have this.

751
00:49:32,396 --> 00:49:35,810
Speaker 1: cash flow comes in once every four or five years deal.

752
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:36,753
Speaker 1: Right.

753
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:42,310
Speaker 1: You need constant cash flow and just only making money when you release the cash flow and release your game.

754
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:54,709
Speaker 1: And not at any other time, even if the game is successful, does not provide a steady stream of cash flow, does not provide a stable business, cannot keep food on the table for people, even if all the games are mega hits.

755
00:49:55,110 --> 00:50:06,590
Speaker 0: Never mind the fact that the vast, vast crushing majority of games, no matter how good they are, will sell less than 50 copies anyway, like selling a few hundred.

756
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:06,911
Speaker 0: Right.

757
00:50:06,931 --> 00:50:11,129
Speaker 1: I'm saying like if you're a hit, if you're not a hit, it doesn't matter what your monetization method is.

758
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:11,773
Speaker 1: You're not a hit.

759
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:14,270
Speaker 1: It's like you didn't make any money, no matter what tricks.

760
00:50:14,771 --> 00:50:17,450
Speaker 0: Everyone I know is release games on Steam, even studios.

761
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,709
Speaker 0: A thousand sales is like the most ludicrous dream come true.

762
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:27,749
Speaker 0: A thousand, a hundred is better than most people will ever see.

763
00:50:30,452 --> 00:50:41,370
Speaker 0: The 30s to 40s run a lot of games end up seeing and that drives this even worse ecosystem where even if you pick a price, no one will pay attention to your game because there's no discoverability.

764
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:53,509
Speaker 0: Your game is in a list, unsorted among tens of thousands of other games, many of which are selling for like a dollar or are actually just free.

765
00:50:55,172 --> 00:50:55,372
Speaker 0: Yep.

766
00:50:55,393 --> 00:51:00,389
Speaker 0: So you almost have to pay for marketing and people and all the things to get.

767
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:10,813
Speaker 0: people even pay attention or know that your game exists in the first place, which either drives your price up higher or takes even more of your tiny profits away or more likely just fails.

768
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:12,590
Speaker 1: Or becomes gambling.

769
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:12,910
Speaker 1: Right.

770
00:51:12,931 --> 00:51:18,730
Speaker 1: It's like I go into debt to pay for ads and hopefully the ads make the game sell and then I make all my money back.

771
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:19,498
Speaker 1: Right.

772
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:20,130
Speaker 1: So gamble.

773
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:27,759
Speaker 0: So the next possibility is that you sell the game directly, just like we said, and maybe you make some money back.

774
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,970
Speaker 0: You probably don't make that much.

775
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:35,134
Speaker 0: But what you really do, the most effective way to make money is to use if that was successful enough,

776
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:36,117
Speaker 1: you

777
00:51:36,258 --> 00:51:49,350
Speaker 0: use that as the hype machine leading into your next game and you usually try to get an investor, a publisher, someone who's going to front money for your next game based on the success of your previous game.

778
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,576
Speaker 0: A lot of people make.

779
00:51:51,716 --> 00:52:00,931
Speaker 0: a studio will make its first game knowing it won't sell many copies and it'll be a commercial disaster because their goal is not to make money with the first game.

780
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:06,909
Speaker 0: It is to make money with their second game by getting a publisher and using the first game to get the publisher to notice them.

781
00:52:07,512 --> 00:52:07,652
Speaker 1: Right.

782
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:13,690
Speaker 1: You're just trying to get some, you know, and this all this stuff applies to, you know, any size of, you know, studio or whatever.

783
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:13,972
Speaker 1: Right.

784
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:17,210
Speaker 0: It's like, I mean, this applies to a lot of industries, not just gaming.

785
00:52:17,431 --> 00:52:20,010
Speaker 1: I'm a generic professional or a bunch of people.

786
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:20,812
Speaker 1: Right.

787
00:52:20,852 --> 00:52:22,077
Speaker 1: It's like you.

788
00:52:22,137 --> 00:52:25,813
Speaker 1: if you can get the publisher, it's like, OK, well, that takes the risk away.

789
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:26,074
Speaker 1: Right.

790
00:52:26,114 --> 00:52:32,350
Speaker 1: It's like even if the second game that the publisher funded is a flop, I was still able to keep food on the table.

791
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:33,051
Speaker 1: Right.

792
00:52:33,071 --> 00:52:38,035
Speaker 1: I got this investment and I use that to feed myself while I made a game and the game failed.

793
00:52:38,297 --> 00:52:39,810
Speaker 1: Maybe I now have to do something else.

794
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:46,307
Speaker 1: But I was able to live by making games for a period of time, regardless of the game succeeding or failing.

795
00:52:46,368 --> 00:52:46,490
Speaker 1: Right.

796
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:54,370
Speaker 1: This this the risk of whether the game succeeded or failed was taken on by the publisher and taken off of my shoulder as the game maker.

797
00:52:56,211 --> 00:52:56,472
Speaker 1: So.

798
00:52:58,177 --> 00:53:03,254
Speaker 0: But now you're in a relationship with a publisher, guess who gets some creative control now?

799
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:06,190
Speaker 0: Guess who starts guiding you toward how to make money?

800
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:09,690
Speaker 0: Because now you haven't actually solved your monetization problem.

801
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:13,410
Speaker 0: You've kicked that can down the road and made it someone else's problem.

802
00:53:13,873 --> 00:53:14,789
Speaker 0: Now you've got a publisher.

803
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:22,174
Speaker 0: Their problem is how do I make money so I can pay these jerks, Rym and Scott back for what I owe them?

804
00:53:22,294 --> 00:53:25,729
Speaker 0: and simultaneously how can I milk them so I make money?

805
00:53:28,294 --> 00:53:28,856
Speaker 1: Yep.

806
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:29,638
Speaker 1: So those are.

807
00:53:29,658 --> 00:53:37,870
Speaker 1: you know, you make one game, you sell it or you try to make a series of games constantly, each one funding the next rolling over.

808
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:38,370
Speaker 1: Right.

809
00:53:38,391 --> 00:53:43,870
Speaker 1: Maybe you get a maybe you hit a jackpot and some kind of series and you just keep making sequels forever.

810
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:44,632
Speaker 1: Right.

811
00:53:44,934 --> 00:53:48,510
Speaker 1: You can get a whole franchise going and that would be one way to go about it.

812
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:55,830
Speaker 1: The other thing, all right, the thing that people are trying to do these days is try ways that get you the constant cash flow.

813
00:53:56,552 --> 00:53:56,734
Speaker 1: Right.

814
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,089
Speaker 0: Have some is one way.

815
00:53:59,032 --> 00:53:59,234
Speaker 1: All right.

816
00:53:59,294 --> 00:54:01,430
Speaker 1: You can do it whether it's free to play or not.

817
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:01,733
Speaker 1: Right.

818
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:03,450
Speaker 1: That's just the initial barrier to entry.

819
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:08,453
Speaker 1: But it's like once someone's in the game, once they're playing it, it's like, OK, we got a player.

820
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:10,890
Speaker 1: Let's try to get more money out of them.

821
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:11,231
Speaker 1: Right.

822
00:54:11,312 --> 00:54:14,770
Speaker 1: We got their initial monies, whether it was zero or a lot or right.

823
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:16,869
Speaker 1: But we're just going to get more monies from them.

824
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:43,850
Speaker 1: So you can sell DLCs, you can sell cosmetic bullshit, you can, you know, basically manufacture any possible thing that could make the player give you more money for more game, for more stuff in the game, gambling, you know, gambling where they always lose whatever you can come up with, whatever kind of nonsense.

825
00:54:44,432 --> 00:54:44,672
Speaker 1: Right.

826
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:57,361
Speaker 1: And the fact is that on the from the perspective of the player, a lot of those monetization techniques, the gambling ones, the pay for things that aren't purely cosmetic.

827
00:54:57,523 --> 00:54:57,767
Speaker 1: Right.

828
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:02,290
Speaker 1: You know, most of those are like immoral.

829
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,175
Speaker 1: Right.

830
00:55:03,235 --> 00:55:03,818
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

831
00:55:03,878 --> 00:55:06,150
Speaker 0: Directly immoral, predatory.

832
00:55:07,032 --> 00:55:15,950
Speaker 0: And what's sad is that they are the most effective way to monetize games and they are one of the only ways people successfully monetize games currently.

833
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:16,952
Speaker 1: Yeah.

834
00:55:16,972 --> 00:55:21,210
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, on the one hand, it's like, yeah, it's immoral to do that.

835
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:25,955
Speaker 1: But if you're on the game making end, it's like, you know, sometimes you feel like that you have no choice.

836
00:55:25,975 --> 00:55:26,196
Speaker 1: It's like.

837
00:55:26,216 --> 00:55:28,529
Speaker 1: that's the only way that you can continue to do this.

838
00:55:29,032 --> 00:55:31,789
Speaker 1: And people don't take the well, don't do that.

839
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,929
Speaker 1: That means your business isn't viable.

840
00:55:34,071 --> 00:55:35,230
Speaker 1: They don't take that as an answer.

841
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:42,830
Speaker 1: The same reason we talk about conventions operating, you know, when this covid, it's like people don't take well, then your business shouldn't exist.

842
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:45,169
Speaker 1: You should go out of business as like a viable path.

843
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:55,930
Speaker 0: I hate to say this, but I think the games industry tabletop and video has hit a point where the vast majority of it is unsustainable and will collapse.

844
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,950
Speaker 0: Almost every studio is going to go under eventually.

845
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,981
Speaker 0: Almost every game designer, everything is so.

846
00:56:02,001 --> 00:56:05,433
Speaker 0: it's such a weak and broken ecosystem right now.

847
00:56:05,453 --> 00:56:09,054
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, they're not going to collapse as long as they can continue to operate immorally.

848
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even then that's starting to.

849
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:13,469
Speaker 0: there's only so much blood you can get out of that stone.

850
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:19,870
Speaker 0: The economy being bad means fewer people, the people who are like fewer people gamble.

851
00:56:19,971 --> 00:56:23,911
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, the people who are most likely to or more people gamble because they're desperate.

852
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:34,909
Speaker 0: I'd say the people who are predated upon by a lot of these types of monetization schemes are the same people predated upon by MLM schemes and NFT scams and all that other stuff.

853
00:56:35,251 --> 00:56:58,969
Speaker 0: So you're competing with scams, you're competing with scams and scammers for these people's attention, but also those people will eventually run out of money because this is a person who will not pay twenty dollars for a game, but will gladly pay four hundred dollars for the exact same game if you just sell it to sell the payment part of it to them slightly differently.

854
00:56:59,972 --> 00:57:03,550
Speaker 0: Yep, like think about the terrifying implications of that statement.

855
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:18,750
Speaker 1: So, yeah, the one, I guess, morally acceptable, the main morally acceptable way to go about this right is to basically break up your game into pieces and sell them individually to sort of change the perception.

856
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:19,151
Speaker 1: Right.

857
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:23,658
Speaker 1: If I have a game, you know, with twenty levels in it and I sell it to you for twenty dollars.

858
00:57:23,678 --> 00:57:24,430
Speaker 1: Right.

859
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:30,867
Speaker 1: Well, OK, you know, at least I got all my twenty dollars, even if you only played level one and then gave up.

860
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:37,329
Speaker 1: But what if I sell you five levels for twenty dollars, I might still write there might be enough there.

861
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:48,210
Speaker 1: That's like if someone was willing to pay twenty dollars and play one level and stop playing the game and I gave him twenty levels, what they would also pay twenty dollars or five levels, play one level and stop playing.

862
00:57:48,452 --> 00:57:48,695
Speaker 1: Right.

863
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:50,149
Speaker 1: Is that I'm still right.

864
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:54,009
Speaker 1: So why would I give you know, I can give less game for the same price.

865
00:57:54,811 --> 00:58:05,790
Speaker 1: And then people who do play the game and finish and if they still want more, now I can start selling levels, you know, additional content.

866
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:10,130
Speaker 0: Toby Fox actually did that with expansions for tabletop games.

867
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:10,975
Speaker 1: Right.

868
00:58:11,036 --> 00:58:12,190
Speaker 0: It's a fantastic model.

869
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:22,290
Speaker 0: So what Toby did is Undertale, I still to this day say it has the best score of any video game I have ever played, but it's a fantastic game.

870
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:24,730
Speaker 0: And he made the sequel Delta Room.

871
00:58:25,851 --> 00:58:28,170
Speaker 0: Delta Room is going to be five chapters long.

872
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:32,513
Speaker 0: It's on the switch and all these platforms, chapters one and two, he released them just free.

873
00:58:32,614 --> 00:58:34,448
Speaker 0: He released one and then he released two just totally free.

874
00:58:35,272 --> 00:58:37,168
Speaker 0: But chapters three, four and five are going to cost money.

875
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:40,823
Speaker 0: Smart way to go.

876
00:58:40,844 --> 00:58:51,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, you just have to for this to work, your game just has to be good enough and compelling enough that someone will actually want to continue and play more.

877
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:52,122
Speaker 1: Right.

878
00:58:52,804 --> 00:58:58,619
Speaker 0: But that is so rare, because even if your game is good, it's very hard to even convince people to try it in the first place.

879
00:58:59,582 --> 00:58:59,783
Speaker 1: Yep.

880
00:59:01,574 --> 00:59:02,560
Speaker 1: So, yes, that's another way.

881
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:15,200
Speaker 0: The most ethical way today, which was ruined by Kickstarter, unfortunately, is crowdfunding up front where you do a Kickstarter like crowdfunding campaign that functions as a preorder.

882
00:59:15,762 --> 00:59:20,439
Speaker 0: If it succeeds, you got paid and you make the game for the people who wanted it.

883
00:59:20,946 --> 00:59:21,599
Speaker 0: Everybody wins.

884
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,820
Speaker 1: And if it doesn't get funded, assuming you actually deliver the game, you don't just like fail to make the game, which you might.

885
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,959
Speaker 0: But let's assume you succeed.

886
00:59:30,004 --> 00:59:31,780
Speaker 0: I think that is the model for the future.

887
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:38,120
Speaker 0: Unfortunately, Kickstarter as a company has fucked up so badly that I'm deleting my account and I urge you to never use them again because of their block.

888
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,951
Speaker 1: But there are other companies that do crowd.

889
00:59:39,971 --> 00:59:41,603
Speaker 0: their companies are coming into that niche.

890
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:44,120
Speaker 1: You could just do a preorder yourself.

891
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:44,441
Speaker 1: Right.

892
00:59:44,482 --> 00:59:47,880
Speaker 1: The problem, the thing is, this is not necessarily perfect.

893
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:48,243
Speaker 1: Right.

894
00:59:48,263 --> 00:59:50,239
Speaker 1: So first of all, there are.

895
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,700
Speaker 1: Companies that are, you know, they don't they have plenty of money, right.

896
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:00,740
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, Nintendo will do a preorder for, you know, like a Zelda game.

897
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:04,662
Speaker 1: But, you know, that's, you know, I guess in the digital era, that doesn't mean much anymore.

898
01:00:04,803 --> 01:00:05,245
Speaker 1: Right.

899
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:07,535
Speaker 1: But in the cartridge era, it meant a lot because it was.

900
01:00:07,555 --> 01:00:09,700
Speaker 1: it wasn't to help them make the game.

901
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,564
Speaker 1: The game was made.

902
01:00:10,605 --> 01:00:13,890
Speaker 1: It was to help them figure out how many to ship to which game stops.

903
01:00:14,074 --> 01:00:14,299
Speaker 0: Right.

904
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:19,100
Speaker 1: Nowadays, the preorders on, you know, big time video games don't make much sense.

905
01:00:19,622 --> 01:00:29,200
Speaker 0: Well, they do because what they are is marketing and proof of demand, because, again, the primary unit of the economy of games is attention, not dollars.

906
01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:30,203
Speaker 1: Yes, sure.

907
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:36,120
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's like they don't need to preorder if they have enough money to make the game and pay all their people already.

908
01:00:36,242 --> 01:00:36,344
Speaker 1: Right.

909
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:37,099
Speaker 1: They're already wealthy.

910
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:44,988
Speaker 1: The preorder is needed only for the small people who it's like if we want to make this game to begin with, we don't we?

911
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,839
Speaker 1: it's like we would have to quit our jobs.

912
01:00:47,321 --> 01:00:55,220
Speaker 0: I would argue the people do preorder as a necessary part of monetization because they capture people, they make that they're making the game.

913
01:00:55,881 --> 01:01:00,156
Speaker 0: They do a preorder and they always put some bonus in the preorder.

914
01:01:00,196 --> 01:01:01,481
Speaker 0: that won't be for the general.

915
01:01:01,501 --> 01:01:07,346
Speaker 1: Those preorders, the preorders that come from the big companies happen after the game is made.

916
01:01:07,567 --> 01:01:09,480
Speaker 1: They're doing it before the game is released.

917
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:20,983
Speaker 1: But after it's made, that is not by Halo five special edition with all this garbage that happens like a week or a month before Halo is released, not five years when they start making it.

918
01:01:21,225 --> 01:01:25,325
Speaker 0: So they happen way earlier in the pipeline nowadays than you'd expect for a lot of companies.

919
01:01:25,627 --> 01:01:28,120
Speaker 1: Those those triple-A games take like years to make.

920
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,580
Speaker 1: They're not doing the special edition preorders as the day they start making the game.

921
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,101
Speaker 1: Right.

922
01:01:33,121 --> 01:01:39,340
Speaker 1: But the preorders from crowdfunding for small places happen before any before like almost anything is made.

923
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:39,660
Speaker 1: Right.

924
01:01:39,681 --> 01:01:46,339
Speaker 0: That's why the model of the Kickstarter style model of it gets funded or it doesn't is probably the best way to go.

925
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:53,602
Speaker 0: But then the economy is going to be around the attention of if there's a million, million, million game people trying to kickstart, trying to crowdsource all their games.

926
01:01:54,105 --> 01:01:56,158
Speaker 0: Most of them aren't going to get crowdsourced in the first place.

927
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:57,722
Speaker 1: Right.

928
01:01:57,802 --> 01:02:06,883
Speaker 1: And also it come now, it's no longer about, you know, while that seems, you know, it seems good, the crowdfunding from the perspective of a small time place doesn't have enough.

929
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:08,120
Speaker 1: Can't get a publisher.

930
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:09,128
Speaker 1: They don't want.

931
01:02:09,149 --> 01:02:10,199
Speaker 1: they want to quit their jobs.

932
01:02:10,542 --> 01:02:12,599
Speaker 1: Like it all makes sense when you think about that way.

933
01:02:13,003 --> 01:02:14,940
Speaker 1: But there's parts of it that don't make sense.

934
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,260
Speaker 1: Like, wait a minute.

935
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:27,340
Speaker 1: You know, even if I crowdfund this game, it's like I'm even if everything I've seen about the game looks good and even if they do deliver it, it's like I'm buying games sight unseen.

936
01:02:27,861 --> 01:02:34,719
Speaker 1: Now I'm making my purchasing decisions not based on who makes the best game, but based on who makes the best, you know, campaign video.

937
01:02:35,021 --> 01:02:35,564
Speaker 0: Yeah.

938
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:39,900
Speaker 1: And it's like there might be better games out there that you missed because the campaign videos are shitty.

939
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:45,800
Speaker 1: You're going to buy games, but I would point out it's already good campaign videos with all monetization schemes.

940
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:54,539
Speaker 0: It's already like this because you have to make a really slick pitch and get marketing crap out everywhere or no one will literally ever hear your game exists.

941
01:02:56,022 --> 01:03:01,083
Speaker 1: You know, and it's like, you know, now it's like the quality of the games again is not mattering.

942
01:03:01,123 --> 01:03:01,304
Speaker 1: Right.

943
01:03:01,364 --> 01:03:08,899
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if you're going to accept capitalism, you're supposed to believe in that voting with your dollars, which is voting for don't.

944
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:09,923
Speaker 1: Right.

945
01:03:10,084 --> 01:03:12,099
Speaker 1: Voting for the thing that you like the most.

946
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:20,360
Speaker 1: Voting for the thing you like the most means you have to know if you like the thing before you spend the money, not after you spend the money.

947
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:21,262
Speaker 1: Right.

948
01:03:21,425 --> 01:03:22,499
Speaker 1: Because they spend it.

949
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,470
Speaker 1: You're just speculating on your.

950
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:27,105
Speaker 1: instead of gambling for money, you're gambling for entertainment.

951
01:03:27,165 --> 01:03:27,548
Speaker 0: Another.

952
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:29,380
Speaker 1: I'm betting that this will be entertaining.

953
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:30,372
Speaker 0: I was wrong.

954
01:03:30,514 --> 01:03:30,879
Speaker 1: Damn it.

955
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,400
Speaker 0: Another growing model is the Patreon style model.

956
01:03:35,481 --> 01:03:38,300
Speaker 0: And there are several games that are funded this way.

957
01:03:38,721 --> 01:03:46,700
Speaker 0: They have some sort of Patreon like system where you pay them a fee, like a monthly fee or annual fee or something.

958
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,927
Speaker 0: But you're basically.

959
01:03:48,987 --> 01:03:51,560
Speaker 0: it's not like I'm paying a monthly fee to access this game.

960
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:56,340
Speaker 0: I'm paying a monthly fee to access this game and have a direct line to the creator.

961
01:03:56,501 --> 01:04:06,842
Speaker 0: And these games tend to be games where content in the game changes and continually gets updated based on the whims and desires of the people who pay the most directly into that system.

962
01:04:06,862 --> 01:04:07,083
Speaker 1: Right.

963
01:04:07,746 --> 01:04:11,700
Speaker 1: In these cases, you're not so much actually paying for a game.

964
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:12,102
Speaker 1: Right.

965
01:04:12,142 --> 01:04:15,319
Speaker 1: It's like there is a game there, but, you know, you might play it.

966
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:20,700
Speaker 1: But what you're actually paying for is like, you know, is just literally it's Patreon.

967
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:21,281
Speaker 1: Right.

968
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:29,119
Speaker 1: You're an artist that you appreciate their works and you are supporting them and you want to maybe a parasocial relationship with them.

969
01:04:29,622 --> 01:04:29,803
Speaker 1: Right.

970
01:04:29,863 --> 01:04:33,540
Speaker 0: I was about to say that is just monetizing parasocial relationships.

971
01:04:33,801 --> 01:04:33,982
Speaker 1: Right.

972
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:34,464
Speaker 1: You want to.

973
01:04:34,484 --> 01:04:37,616
Speaker 1: you want to access their community or them or whatever.

974
01:04:38,801 --> 01:04:39,083
Speaker 1: Right.

975
01:04:39,164 --> 01:04:40,877
Speaker 1: And it's like you're paying for that.

976
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:46,080
Speaker 1: And the person the art, the person happens to produce happens to be a game.

977
01:04:46,742 --> 01:04:47,305
Speaker 1: But it has.

978
01:04:47,365 --> 01:04:49,900
Speaker 1: you're not monetizing the game really.

979
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:50,946
Speaker 1: You know, you're just.

980
01:04:51,147 --> 01:04:51,550
Speaker 1: you're just.

981
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:53,200
Speaker 1: it's the same as other forms.

982
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:59,280
Speaker 1: You know, it wouldn't be any different as if they were a musician or a filmmaker or a photographer or whatever.

983
01:04:59,801 --> 01:05:03,400
Speaker 1: You know, it just happens to be that they make games, you know.

984
01:05:03,461 --> 01:05:04,679
Speaker 1: And I guess that's not the worst.

985
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:04,961
Speaker 1: Right.

986
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:08,020
Speaker 1: Because those are all valid ways to fund those other forms.

987
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,620
Speaker 0: But just like with everything else in capitalism, it leads to a patron.

988
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,640
Speaker 0: You know, it's called Patreon.

989
01:05:13,401 --> 01:05:20,240
Speaker 0: It leads to a patron system where rich nerds are the only people who decide what kinds of games get made and how those games get made.

990
01:05:20,301 --> 01:05:20,709
Speaker 0: And that's it.

991
01:05:21,036 --> 01:05:21,219
Speaker 1: Yeah.

992
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,882
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, this is thing is, you know, people complain all about copyright, rightly so.

993
01:05:25,962 --> 01:05:29,681
Speaker 1: There's a lot of problems with the current copyright regime and copyright in general.

994
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:40,380
Speaker 1: But the copyright system that came into play right, you know, in the last couple of centuries replaced the patronage system, which was way worse.

995
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,001
Speaker 1: Right.

996
01:05:41,242 --> 01:05:54,725
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if you believe that someone who makes art with all of their time should be someone who deserves, you know, food, shelter, et cetera, and you don't set up socialism.

997
01:05:54,745 --> 01:06:03,780
Speaker 1: so where everyone just gets those things, no matter what, as a human right, then it must follow that those people who are artists must get money somehow.

998
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:16,500
Speaker 1: And there's not really a lot of other ideas out there, video games or other medium for how those people can get money without one of these kind of shenanigans.

999
01:06:18,082 --> 01:06:33,563
Speaker 0: And they're all problematic, mostly, so I can think of two more like different monetization models and we're running out of like fundamental ways you can do this other than just you're rich and you release games that you want and you don't care if anyone plays them.

1000
01:06:33,764 --> 01:06:36,760
Speaker 1: Well, there's the really basic one, which is subscription, right?

1001
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,040
Speaker 1: It's like you have a World of Warcraft and it costs X a month dollars.

1002
01:06:40,282 --> 01:06:40,504
Speaker 1: Right.

1003
01:06:40,584 --> 01:06:42,620
Speaker 1: And it's like you can get the steady cash flow.

1004
01:06:43,281 --> 01:06:47,360
Speaker 1: And because now not only have you made a game, you're constantly making more game.

1005
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:48,533
Speaker 1: It's a game that never ends.

1006
01:06:48,553 --> 01:06:49,120
Speaker 1: Right.

1007
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,368
Speaker 1: And so that's your.

1008
01:06:51,488 --> 01:06:56,059
Speaker 1: you're delivering value to the people who are constantly paying and it's a service that you keep up.

1009
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:07,020
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, when I was a long time ago, I felt that I never did that right for any game because I was like, you know, so used to just buying a game and owning it.

1010
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:11,440
Speaker 1: And also I didn't have that much money to subscribe to a video game like that.

1011
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,119
Speaker 1: You know, the more than that cost more than Netflix costs now.

1012
01:07:14,721 --> 01:07:14,963
Speaker 1: Right.

1013
01:07:15,467 --> 01:07:17,160
Speaker 1: But it's actually not bad.

1014
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:24,799
Speaker 0: The subscription game model, if so, if Overwatch got rid of those loot boxes for skins and it was just ten bucks a month, I would just pay ten bucks a month.

1015
01:07:25,621 --> 01:07:31,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, sure, it's it's a lot of money for, you know, most people to pay.

1016
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,600
Speaker 0: But think about the value you get.

1017
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,959
Speaker 0: I play Overwatch ten hours a week.

1018
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,900
Speaker 0: So, yeah, dollar an hour for not even a dollar an hour.

1019
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:43,200
Speaker 0: So ten bucks a month for 40 hours of entertainment a month.

1020
01:07:43,483 --> 01:07:44,919
Speaker 0: That is a crazy good deal.

1021
01:07:45,622 --> 01:07:57,339
Speaker 1: If your game is really good and you can deliver a player base, right, you know, to get a lot of people playing it who really care about it and it has some multiplayer online component of it.

1022
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:57,681
Speaker 1: Right.

1023
01:07:57,701 --> 01:07:59,920
Speaker 1: That's, you know, especially if it's MMO, obviously.

1024
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:00,281
Speaker 1: Right.

1025
01:08:00,422 --> 01:08:07,880
Speaker 1: Then it's like, hey, you know, you can feed all your staff as an ongoing business with a subscription model.

1026
01:08:08,424 --> 01:08:10,160
Speaker 1: And it's like there's really nothing wrong with that.

1027
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:18,960
Speaker 1: The only really downside is that, you know, if you can't sustain the game, you know, in the long term, eventually it's going to fade and lose popularity.

1028
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:22,979
Speaker 0: It also doesn't work for games that are a one and done like I made in Advance Wars.

1029
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:23,621
Speaker 0: There it is.

1030
01:08:24,423 --> 01:08:30,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has to be a forever game and, you know, no game lasts forever.

1031
01:08:30,781 --> 01:08:35,520
Speaker 1: But it keeps people out of the game who don't have a lot of money.

1032
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:35,921
Speaker 1: Right.

1033
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:43,176
Speaker 1: Because even up even five dollars a month or like what, you know, is like kids can't be paying five dollars a month.

1034
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:43,741
Speaker 1: Right.

1035
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:48,826
Speaker 1: It's like only adults are going to be with jobs are going to be able to like subscribe.

1036
01:08:48,907 --> 01:08:50,000
Speaker 0: The industry is going this way.

1037
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,336
Speaker 0: This PlayStation Network and all these things and game pass increasingly.

1038
01:08:53,356 --> 01:08:58,466
Speaker 0: a lot of kids, their parents buy them a subscription and they just get whatever games are in that subscription.

1039
01:08:58,506 --> 01:08:59,620
Speaker 0: And there's the only games they get.

1040
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,580
Speaker 0: That is the most common way parents interact with their kids in terms of video games.

1041
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:10,830
Speaker 1: Now, what I mean, if you can get a game and get your game into one of those subscriptions, you get a piece of.

1042
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:13,383
Speaker 1: you get a piece of the money or I don't know how to calculate it.

1043
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:16,200
Speaker 1: Do they do it like royalties, like however many people play the game?

1044
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,381
Speaker 0: Once that ecosystem scales up, I'm pretty sure it's going to be like Spotify where you don't make shit.

1045
01:09:21,426 --> 01:09:27,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like every time someone plays, every time someone with the bundle plays your game, you get a fraction of some penny.

1046
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,081
Speaker 1: Right.

1047
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,425
Speaker 1: It's like so.

1048
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:40,300
Speaker 0: two other ways you can go is one, the game that is designed as an e-sport and you make your money from the e-sport itself as opposed to from the game.

1049
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Speaker 1: However, I mean, that's the same.

1050
01:09:42,281 --> 01:09:47,417
Speaker 1: You know, that's the same as making money from merch or from any sort of ancillary things around the game.

1051
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:49,770
Speaker 0: I still don't think anyone has tried like.

1052
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:53,260
Speaker 0: I don't think the ecosystem is mature enough to support that fully.

1053
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,779
Speaker 0: The attempts that have been made have mostly failed.

1054
01:09:57,142 --> 01:10:03,200
Speaker 0: It's not like hockey where they make their money from the fact that people are watching hockey, not for the fact that people are playing hockey directly.

1055
01:10:03,823 --> 01:10:04,640
Speaker 0: But we're not there.

1056
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:13,099
Speaker 1: There are companies that make money from people playing hockey or hockey equipment companies, but they're not making as much money as like the NHL is.

1057
01:10:14,081 --> 01:10:14,241
Speaker 1: No.

1058
01:10:15,164 --> 01:10:21,461
Speaker 0: And the last way that is, I've seen a few small time game designers and game makers do this.

1059
01:10:21,782 --> 01:10:26,482
Speaker 0: They make a game, but they are themselves or they know someone who is a live streamer.

1060
01:10:27,124 --> 01:10:29,232
Speaker 0: The game is very entertaining to watch.

1061
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:34,440
Speaker 0: or they set up an ecosystem where people basically pay for the live stream.

1062
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,660
Speaker 0: They make their money almost entirely from the live streaming.

1063
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:41,780
Speaker 0: Someone buying the game and playing it on their own is almost like a secondary effect.

1064
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,838
Speaker 0: It's just like bonus money.

1065
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:44,476
Speaker 0: But that is also rare.

1066
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:49,700
Speaker 1: Usually people are paying streamers to stream their game as a form of advertising.

1067
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:53,140
Speaker 1: How do you make you like if someone streams your game, you don't make money from that.

1068
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:53,916
Speaker 1: You pay for that.

1069
01:10:53,977 --> 01:10:54,018
Speaker 0: No.

1070
01:10:54,180 --> 01:11:04,242
Speaker 0: So what if you have a deal with a streamer where you make a game, they stream your game, your game is uniquely entertaining in a stream and that and you share revenue with the streamer.

1071
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,940
Speaker 1: I've never seen that small stuff.

1072
01:11:09,424 --> 01:11:18,599
Speaker 0: I, I strongly suspect the streamers streaming totally accurate battle simulator specifically make more money than that game has ever made in sales.

1073
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:23,843
Speaker 1: What I mean, the streamers make the money, but the people who make the game are spending money on that.

1074
01:11:24,526 --> 01:11:25,550
Speaker 1: So the streamers are.

1075
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,662
Speaker 1: the streamers are advertised are basically doing sponsor.

1076
01:11:28,882 --> 01:11:40,885
Speaker 0: I'm saying if you make a game, a way to monetize it is to also be the streamer instead of paying a streamer and the stream might make money or the stream might cause the game to make money.

1077
01:11:41,107 --> 01:11:42,900
Speaker 0: It basically buys you a two lottery tickets.

1078
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:48,140
Speaker 0: All it costs you is doing two completely different jobs simultaneously.

1079
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:53,060
Speaker 1: Well, but why would you if you're if you are if you can be a successful streamer, right?

1080
01:11:53,581 --> 01:12:00,200
Speaker 1: Why would you make a game for yourself to play that might get you a second revo stream?

1081
01:12:00,581 --> 01:12:03,280
Speaker 0: This only assumes we're in the situation you and I talked about.

1082
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:07,040
Speaker 1: We already made just play games that other people have made.

1083
01:12:07,442 --> 01:12:08,086
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

1084
01:12:08,146 --> 01:12:10,339
Speaker 0: This assumes what we said at the beginning of this bit.

1085
01:12:11,203 --> 01:12:12,451
Speaker 0: We already made the game.

1086
01:12:12,492 --> 01:12:13,599
Speaker 0: How do we make money with it?

1087
01:12:13,902 --> 01:12:15,540
Speaker 0: How do you and I make money with the game?

1088
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:19,415
Speaker 0: We start live streaming it and try to make an entertaining live stream.

1089
01:12:19,596 --> 01:12:21,506
Speaker 1: that that still makes no sense.

1090
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:23,280
Speaker 1: If you can make a successful live stream.

1091
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,659
Speaker 1: Why did you make a game like we are?

1092
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:31,288
Speaker 1: But we probably make more money than someone else's more popular game than your own unpopular game.

1093
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:32,519
Speaker 0: I'm saying we already made the game.

1094
01:12:33,222 --> 01:12:36,000
Speaker 0: So now we're trying to monetize it, monetize it by streaming.

1095
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:37,706
Speaker 1: You're going to if you're.

1096
01:12:37,826 --> 01:12:40,480
Speaker 1: if your stream is not successful, you're not going to monetize.

1097
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:43,640
Speaker 1: You're not going to be able to monetize your own if selling the game is not successful.

1098
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,540
Speaker 0: You're not going to monetize selling the game.

1099
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:46,403
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

1100
01:12:46,423 --> 01:12:50,360
Speaker 1: If your stream is successful, you could make more money.

1101
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:57,300
Speaker 1: Streaming another already popular game than you could streaming your own unpopular game.

1102
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,003
Speaker 0: It depends.

1103
01:12:58,103 --> 01:13:01,139
Speaker 1: So there's no reason to stream your own game.

1104
01:13:01,801 --> 01:13:02,082
Speaker 1: Right.

1105
01:13:02,403 --> 01:13:08,260
Speaker 0: Like as a way to make money, except as we agreed at the start of the show, the whole premise was you already make the game.

1106
01:13:08,543 --> 01:13:09,675
Speaker 0: Now, how do you make money with it?

1107
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,220
Speaker 1: Streaming your own game is not a good way to make money.

1108
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:14,762
Speaker 0: How do you know?

1109
01:13:14,782 --> 01:13:19,202
Speaker 0: streaming probably makes more money for the people who stream than most games do?

1110
01:13:19,464 --> 01:13:23,200
Speaker 1: So if you already made it straight, you've already made a game, right?

1111
01:13:23,943 --> 01:13:25,459
Speaker 1: And you're a successful streamer.

1112
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:32,339
Speaker 1: Even if you've already made the game, streaming another more popular game will make you more money streaming.

1113
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,220
Speaker 0: Well, that's your fault for having made the game already made game.

1114
01:13:35,462 --> 01:13:37,358
Speaker 0: That's your fault for having made the game in the first place.

1115
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:39,864
Speaker 1: You can't.

1116
01:13:40,306 --> 01:13:42,940
Speaker 1: streaming is not a way to monetize a game you have made.

1117
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:46,620
Speaker 0: It's a way to I think it absolutely is getting paid for the stream.

1118
01:13:46,761 --> 01:13:55,300
Speaker 0: I think there's more money there, but I think the use for this now in the current ecosystem would be specifically the fairly rare situation of you've made a game.

1119
01:13:55,622 --> 01:13:56,620
Speaker 0: It wasn't successful.

1120
01:13:57,283 --> 01:13:59,380
Speaker 0: You don't want to pay some other streamer to stream it.

1121
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:04,180
Speaker 0: You start streaming your own game or you do a revenue sharing with the stream.

1122
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:05,003
Speaker 1: That's not good.

1123
01:14:05,064 --> 01:14:21,360
Speaker 1: That makes no sense, because if you are if you are capable of of making a popular stream, even if you've already made an unpopular game, you will make more money streaming on another someone else's popular game, not necessarily the ecosystem in your own game.

1124
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:24,460
Speaker 1: That ecosystem is going to make your stream unpopular.

1125
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:30,939
Speaker 0: Generally, the ecosystems of the people who stream big games is a very small number of streamers who make all the money and nobody else makes anything.

1126
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:37,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, so but people who stream unpopular games, there's nobody who's popular, right?

1127
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:51,000
Speaker 1: You have to stream a popular game to have any chance and to begin with, not necessarily if you're a popular streamer, actually, even the popular streamers, if you watch their streams, as soon as they switch like a sponsored game, the views drop to nothing.

1128
01:14:51,301 --> 01:15:01,319
Speaker 1: Well, if you are capable of being a popular streamer and you try to give yourself free sponsored slots to your own game, everyone will stop watching you immediately when you switch to the game that you made.

1129
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:04,495
Speaker 0: I mean, you say that, but I still think it's a monetization model.

1130
01:15:04,515 --> 01:15:08,458
Speaker 0: that's possible because like we said, the assumption was it's not monetizing the game.

1131
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:15,480
Speaker 1: You're just being a streamer who happens to have made a game and you will make more money just being a streamer if you're a good.

1132
01:15:15,801 --> 01:15:18,439
Speaker 0: Well, like I said, that's your fault for having made the game in the first place.

1133
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:21,140
Speaker 1: That's you're making no sense anyway.

1134
01:15:22,423 --> 01:15:22,807
Speaker 1: It's time.

1135
01:15:22,827 --> 01:15:23,778
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1136
01:15:26,262 --> 01:15:28,420

Speaker 0: I don't know what else can be said about the horrific school shooting that seems to have happened today.

1149
01:16:33,709 --> 01:16:36,022
Speaker 0: that is separate from the other two shootings that just happened.

1150
01:16:36,163 --> 01:16:40,440
Speaker 0: So I don't know what to say other than disown your Republican relatives.

1151
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:41,868
Speaker 0: And I leave you simply with.

1152
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:43,620
Speaker 1: these kids weren't unlucky.

1153
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,159
Speaker 1: This only happens in this country.

1154
01:16:48,701 --> 01:16:54,733
Speaker 1: And nowhere else, nowhere else do little kids go to school thinking that they might be shot that day.

1155
01:16:56,861 --> 01:17:06,305
Speaker 1: Nowhere else do parents have to talk to their kids, as I have had to do, about why they got locked into a bathroom and told to be quiet for five minutes just in case a bad man entered that building.

1156
01:17:06,646 --> 01:17:09,605
Speaker 1: Nowhere else does that happen except here in the United States of America.

1157
01:17:09,928 --> 01:17:10,920
Speaker 1: And it is a choice.

1158
01:17:13,242 --> 01:17:17,180
Speaker 1: It is our choice to let it continue.

1159
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,940
Speaker 0: What are we doing?
