1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:08,840
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:11,599
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday April 23rd 2019.

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,807
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:22,277
Speaker 1: We've got two tabletop sports for you with catch the moon and volt Faustin.

5
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:31,293
Speaker 0: Let's do this Alright, so the Roosevelt Island to a two weeks ago.

6
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:32,537
Speaker 1: Yeah had the shit show.

7
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:39,252
Speaker 1: they had their annual You know cherry blossom festival And I guess someone wrote an article about it or like advertised.

8
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,160
Speaker 0: if you don't know about Roosevelt Island is not from New York.

9
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,106
Speaker 0: Just go to Google Maps.

10
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:44,240
Speaker 0: type in Roosevelt Island and see where it is.

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,120
Speaker 0: It's weird island in the middle of the East River that it was previously known as welfare island.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, people live on it.

13
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:51,200
Speaker 0: There's it used to be a smallpox hospital there.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,815
Speaker 0: There used to be a tram that went up and down from the bridge now.

15
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:54,700
Speaker 0: There's a sky car.

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,792
Speaker 0: Anyway, they have cherry blossoms there and people go to see them.

17
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:58,094
Speaker 0: Yep.

18
00:00:58,174 --> 00:00:59,037
Speaker 1: I do I go every year.

19
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,511
Speaker 0: Yeah So there's big festival and it was a shit show.

20
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:04,259
Speaker 0: So we're like, well, let's avoid that.

21
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:14,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the secret of New York is if any Publication of any kind talks about any free event anywhere in the five boroughs is the first year.

22
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:14,920
Speaker 0: It was a shit show.

23
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:18,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's never so Years someone talked about it.

24
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:23,080
Speaker 1: So instead of like a thousand people going tens of thousands of people tried to go.

25
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:27,440
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's not an easy place to get to even during non festival times.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,264
Speaker 0: We tried to go there.

27
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:30,794
Speaker 0: we take the bus down and we think all right.

28
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,060
Speaker 0: I normally just bike there.

29
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,625
Speaker 1: I would never.

30
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:37,660
Speaker 1: I would never go to Roosevelt Island except except on foot or on bicycle.

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,910
Speaker 0: Hey, we took the bus down there.

32
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,280
Speaker 0: We're like, alright, let's take on the F train.

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,691
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's a weekend the F trains not going that way.

34
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:45,305
Speaker 0: We'd have to go backwards and then forwards like alright Let's just walk there.

35
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:47,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's one subway station on Roosevelt.

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,754
Speaker 0: There is a bus and it learned while we were walking over the bridge.

37
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:51,960
Speaker 1: Oh the Roosevelt Island bus.

38
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:54,148
Speaker 0: No, there actually is a New York bus.

39
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,036
Speaker 0: The Roosevelt Island bus only goes on the island.

40
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,160
Speaker 1: No, that is not true.

41
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:59,940
Speaker 0: Anyway, I've never seen the red bus go off the island.

42
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:06,816
Speaker 1: It was like a q1 talking like, you know a lot about Roosevelt Island, but I'm getting the impression You don't know that much about saying I've never seen the red bus.

43
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:07,380
Speaker 0: leave the island.

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,435
Speaker 1: Dude, the red bus is on Crescent Street all the time.

45
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:10,020
Speaker 0: I never seen it.

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,655
Speaker 0: Anyway, I saw the q1 o2 going over the bridge onto the island.

47
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,640
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh we could have used that.

48
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't even know where to get on the queue 102 any.

49
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,780
Speaker 1: Oh, wow only 12,000 people live on Roosevelt Island.

50
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a lot of people.

51
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:21,809
Speaker 1: Roosevelt Island.

52
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:24,080
Speaker 1: Therefore is one of the bigger cities in America.

53
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,756
Speaker 0: Anyway on they building that new school thing there, right?

54
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:32,980
Speaker 0: So yeah It's kind of creepy because it's like a Cornell Tech School and it's real big.

55
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,720
Speaker 0: It's like a whole university like like a whole college, right?

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,758
Speaker 0: And I look at all these buildings that look most of them look done.

57
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:47,740
Speaker 0: ish One of them is not but the other ones are and I look it in the window and there's like desks in there Yeah, and computers like good to go and I saw no people because it ain't live yet.

58
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:52,640
Speaker 0: But it's like it's real weird dude if it to see that all that stuff like.

59
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:55,993
Speaker 0: So we're ready to be used.

60
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:57,540
Speaker 0: not a student not a nothing.

61
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:02,160
Speaker 1: You may recall that one of my primary hobbies before I moved to New York City was urban exploration.

62
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:10,869
Speaker 1: That is 100% the kind of place I would break into for funsies, but in New York City I don't want to get shot as a terrorist or anything.

63
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,274
Speaker 1: So I don't break into buildings anymore.

64
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:23,999
Speaker 0: Anyway, so The apparently is two different kinds of cherry blossoms and the kind that was open during the festival You know would have still been around but there was some kind of storm action that blew them all off.

65
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,111
Speaker 1: What we went over there the next day and they were all.

66
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:26,896
Speaker 0: that was the next day.

67
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:27,520
Speaker 0: This is a week later.

68
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:28,567
Speaker 0: It was a storm.

69
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:29,776
Speaker 1: Oh you went this weekend.

70
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:32,920
Speaker 1: Yes Because this weekend the other cherries were blue, right?

71
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,460
Speaker 0: So the other chair the newer ones they had some action, but actually they weren't a hundred percent ready.

72
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,818
Speaker 0: So I bet if you go like the middle of this week or next weekend, the other kind will be even crazier.

73
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:43,520
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah.

74
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:54,239
Speaker 0: So while we're there we realized oh There was actually a much easier non bike way to get here that we forgot about the ferry and used to go home.

75
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:59,158
Speaker 1: So for the first time heavily subsidized actually really awesome East River Ferry.

76
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:02,535
Speaker 0: for the first time I took the ferry and I'm sure it is heavily subsidized.

77
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:03,400
Speaker 0: who knows what it cost?

78
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,930
Speaker 0: But actually I was very surprised.

79
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:06,580
Speaker 0: a lot of people are using it.

80
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:19,740
Speaker 0: Dude, the ferry is really really important now in New York Like if it disappeared there'd be trouble because it's Pete I guess the people online are complaining about the ferry like yeah I want to see ridership data, you know, it's costing a lot of money.

81
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,492
Speaker 1: Dude, I see people on the ferry late at night.

82
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,160
Speaker 0: There's a lot of people on that ferry.

83
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,490
Speaker 0: It was exactly on time.

84
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,620
Speaker 0: It took me directly where I wanted to go.

85
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,733
Speaker 1: The only complaint I have is that it tends to only run every hour.

86
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it needs to run.

87
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,629
Speaker 1: I think it should run every 10 minutes.

88
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:36,794
Speaker 1: I don't care how much that costs.

89
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:39,904
Speaker 0: It was not frequent but It was pretty great.

90
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:46,129
Speaker 0: So if you cut in New York and you know, you have to go somewhere Consider the ferry.

91
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,803
Speaker 1: I would even say go one step further if you're Touristing in New York.

92
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,714
Speaker 1: The ferry is a great way to see Autana, New York.

93
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:55,620
Speaker 0: It goes to touristy places, too.

94
00:04:55,721 --> 00:05:01,875
Speaker 1: Yeah You can take the ferry down Like to lower Manhattan and then you can take a different ferry to Staten Island.

95
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:03,200
Speaker 1: don't get off in Staten Island.

96
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:07,415
Speaker 1: But if you ride the ferry to Staten Island and you want it it's only like 275 to ride it.

97
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,767
Speaker 0: Yeah, compare that.

98
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:10,432
Speaker 0: It's like well, I don't know.

99
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:12,764
Speaker 0: the tourist boat costs like The Circle Line is actually good.

100
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:13,908
Speaker 0: It's it's a good tourist thing to do.

101
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:19,452
Speaker 1: But I think sometimes the Staten Island ferry is just free.

102
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:20,638
Speaker 0: The Staten Island ferry is always free.

103
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:21,361
Speaker 1: It is free I don't know.

104
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:23,168
Speaker 0: I wrote the Staten Island ferry once in my life.

105
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:26,380
Speaker 0: There are scammers who hide out near the Staten Island ferry and pretend to sell tickets.

106
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:34,066
Speaker 0: They sell like $40 tickets to tourists and then the tourists ride it and they're like, they don't realize That it's just free.

107
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:35,920
Speaker 0: It's just free all the time always.

108
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:42,058
Speaker 1: But the secret is if you get on this ferry, it just goes around the Statue of Liberty like right next to it.

109
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,399
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

110
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,405
Speaker 1: So in the news, what do you got?

111
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:52,537
Speaker 0: so there's this game coming out what's it called scroll subverse, right?

112
00:05:52,677 --> 00:06:00,780
Speaker 0: So Apparently there's a company called FOW interactive that I never heard of before today and they make porn games of some kind.

113
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:07,709
Speaker 1: It's like oh, oh not subverse like submarine but subverse like sub First.

114
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:14,100
Speaker 0: yes, okay All right, so I'd never heard of them, but there are 10,000 comments on this Kickstarter, right?

115
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,041
Speaker 0: But apparently they're kind of popular and people like their porn games, you know They're the.

116
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:19,788
Speaker 0: I don't know if they're the good porn game.

117
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:21,896
Speaker 0: I get the feeling they're not the good point.

118
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,502
Speaker 1: two million dollars They're pledged.

119
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:25,007
Speaker 0: What good what?

120
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,432
Speaker 0: so they have decided.

121
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,780
Speaker 0: I guess they successfully have made games in the past.

122
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:36,826
Speaker 0: So they're making a game that is basically shitty Mass Effect But porn where you have sex with wife.

123
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:37,367
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

124
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:43,626
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why we made subverse a tactical RPG shmup hybrid With fucking.

125
00:06:43,908 --> 00:06:44,351
Speaker 0: that's right.

126
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:54,360
Speaker 0: It's it's literally just Mass Effect only probably not as good a piece of software because I mean whether you like the game Mass Effect or not It's a triple-a Quality software that cost a lot of money.

127
00:06:54,862 --> 00:07:07,520
Speaker 1: While at one point it's like your ship is crewed by the sexiest and deadly deadliest waifu's But I don't think it's just waifu's because it looks like there's also a character who is a perpetually stoned imp with six testicles.

128
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:15,868
Speaker 0: The point is this game on Kickstarter has already got a million plus dollars, you know, which is Shocking.

129
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:29,040
Speaker 1: there's an old adage In every part of the internet where art is made is that if you are if you really want to make money Just make it the porn version of the thing you wanted to make and you will never need to work again.

130
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:33,060
Speaker 0: You don't even have to do a great job because the porn covers for your lower quality ness.

131
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:35,310
Speaker 0: I mean, let's just make porn settlers of good time.

132
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:42,140
Speaker 0: It'll be a really shitty board game of porn Like porno miniatures that is naked and Scott Sellers is already pornographic.

133
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,360
Speaker 1: Kinda if you got any wood cuz I got a bunch of sheep.

134
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,868
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's just make the literal.

135
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:47,832
Speaker 0: just go all out like that.

136
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:49,280
Speaker 0: His is my sheep and these are wood.

137
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:50,257
Speaker 0: They just fit into each other.

138
00:07:52,941 --> 00:08:02,540
Speaker 1: It is like you would be if you're not aware of like this side of the world like there are people I know Who make a living in New York like a living living?

139
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,851
Speaker 1: Just drawing furry fetish porn.

140
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:05,616
Speaker 1: That's it.

141
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:06,220
Speaker 1: That's all they do.

142
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:19,217
Speaker 1: there are patreon that you can only find if you know the thing like know where to look because they can't search patreon and They make like $40,000 a month and it's just like bad porn updated monthly.

143
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:25,160
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm There's people who just sit at home with a webcam not having any sort of middleman or company.

144
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:30,680
Speaker 0: Just you know being naked in front of a webcam and people just keep giving them money all day long.

145
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,168
Speaker 0: So as long as they stay there look at it.

146
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:34,171
Speaker 1: shots from this game.

147
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,158
Speaker 1: It actually looks really bad.

148
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:42,111

150
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:45,680
Speaker 1: oh really this is this is what titillates you.

151
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:54,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay Just I couldn't not do it as news because look how much money people are paying for this game We love to entertain.

152
00:08:54,504 --> 00:09:06,162
Speaker 1: so we decided to pack subverse to the brim with waifus of multiple alien species and organic Classifications all of which were created by world-renowned art director and squid girl titty enthusiast Mm-hmm.

153
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:06,664

Speaker 0: but yeah.

160
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:21,100
Speaker 1: But I don't think I am worried that you cannot actually date the perpetually stoned amp with six testicles.

161
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:21,965
Speaker 1: I'm worried.

162
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:24,240
Speaker 1: you can only date the big-breasted waifus.

163
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:30,466
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that's correct and people are gonna pay one point two million dollars or pledge Rim if you could date.

164
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:35,939
Speaker 0: see just tell the post a comment one of the comments and say look if you let me date the Six-testicle guy I will play this game.

165
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:42,274
Speaker 1: I mean cuz that's basically we're gonna say if I could have dated Ventus will I would have played the to the end of rune factory for?

166
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,870
Speaker 1: Anyway, oh there's oh so there is.

167
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,240

00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:53,806
Speaker 0: Good lord for a million dollars.

169
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:54,548

Speaker 1: when I say that I like to watch you know, do you know what I'm actually quoting?

179
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,907
Speaker 0: I do I think I do.

180
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:35,655
Speaker 1: do you think you do?

181
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:38,407
Speaker 1: We'll convene on this later.

182
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,840
Speaker 1: So in some other news, this is breaking today.

183
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:52,340
Speaker 1: But if you weren't aware in the games industry, there's been a really annoying problem for a while because China As you know is a country that does not have free speech and is very like most countries on earth.

184
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:54,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, free speech is super rare.

185
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,395
Speaker 0: It's like United States.

186
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:56,400
Speaker 0: end of list.

187
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:00,760
Speaker 1: Yep, pretty much and even then free speech in the US has a lot of problems.

188
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:03,408
Speaker 0: I mean other countries sort of have free speech.

189
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:07,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, not really Germany's a lot better in a lot of ways.

190
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,784
Speaker 0: They still don't have free speech.

191
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:12,495
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'd be okay with American free speech except for fascists.

192
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:13,538
Speaker 0: Sure, but I'm just.

193
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:24,722
Speaker 0: I'm not saying Yeah, I'm just saying a tech, you know, Mary United States is one of the only countries to have actual free speech on paper For good or ill Guaranteed.

194
00:11:24,923 --> 00:11:30,708
Speaker 1: but China if you want to sell a video game in China You have to submit it to the government.

195
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:35,685
Speaker 0: if you want to be gonna release any artwork or anything in China You're gonna do anything in China.

196
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:41,340
Speaker 1: So a while ago the Chinese government stopped approving any new video games.

197
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:51,180
Speaker 1: Yep, and they started didn't approve any for nine months due to some Like some complicated reason where the government was like restructuring and I didn't really understand it.

198
00:11:52,505 --> 00:12:04,192
Speaker 1: All I know is that it was actually really causing a problem in the game industry Because a lot of publishers were planning on selling games They were developing in China and they put in their applications and they were just ignored.

199
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:04,654
Speaker 1: Hmm.

200
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:16,492
Speaker 1: So the freeze has ended The reorganization is done and they've implemented a bunch of new rules and as of today We now know the rules and restrictions and to quote Kotaku.

201
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:20,820
Speaker 1: It's not to looking so good for Mortal Kombat 11.

202
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,500
Speaker 1: So China has now banned several genres of games.

203
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:28,780
Speaker 1: So games that involve gambling can no longer be made.

204
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,623
Speaker 0: That's good.

205
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:34,926
Speaker 0: Belgium got rid of a whole lot of gambling in games, you know, but not no No, but this means you could not.

206
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:37,779
Speaker 1: this is like this implies that you could not have a game.

207
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:41,093
Speaker 1: You could not have an RPG where you play poker to fight people.

208
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:41,896
Speaker 0: Sounds good.

209
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:48,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay You cannot have mahjong or poker or gambling as a focus of the game.

210
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:56,380
Speaker 1: You cannot in any way represent China's Imperial history so you can't even play destiny warriors.

211
00:12:56,561 --> 00:13:00,193
Speaker 1: I guess not any any part of China's history.

212
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:02,400
Speaker 1: at least at least it says Imperial history here.

213
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,016
Speaker 1: But there's a note because it's not Exactly clear what they mean by this and all the clarifications are in Chinese.

214
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:19,368
Speaker 1: like this is breaking news So it hasn't been fully translated for me yet, but it seems that games that deal with much of China's history Regardless of context are banned.

215
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:27,146
Speaker 1: Okay, corpses cannot be shown nor can blood and Recoloring blood is specifically prohibited.

216
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:32,840
Speaker 1: You cannot pull the Mortal Kombat of green blood or that sweat coming off of that guy.

217
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:34,202
Speaker 1: Okay.

218
00:13:34,502 --> 00:13:48,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the these rules are actually pretty restrictive because just before the show I tried to go through a list of games I could think of that have come out recently or would be coming out and Most of them run afoul of at least one of these rules.

219
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,722
Speaker 1: no Mario Yeah, overwatch couldn't.

220
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:53,726
Speaker 1: well Mario does the goomba who is squash count as a corpse?

221
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:55,789
Speaker 1: No, I mean you killed him.

222
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:56,430
Speaker 1: He's dead.

223
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,505
Speaker 0: uh-huh Tetris touch.

224
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:00,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, Tetris does not have corpses.

225
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,652
Speaker 1: Tetris is good.

226
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:03,860
Speaker 0: There's plenty of games that are just fine.

227
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:15,897
Speaker 1: But the real interesting thing now is that the rules like based on what I'm reading here The rules have gotten to the point with this recent release that a lot of studios in the u.s.

228
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:25,680
Speaker 1: Now Aren't sure if they could possibly Make like take games that are already in the pipeline and get them to the point where they would get Chinese regulatory approval.

229
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,620
Speaker 0: There was that recent news that the switch was approved for sale in China.

230
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,849
Speaker 0: Maybe it's because the switch has Nintendo.

231
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,099
Speaker 0: Like I said makes a lot of games that are perfectly.

232
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,764
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah They're not making games.

233
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:38,840
Speaker 0: or you chop people up and shoot people up with guns or make lots of blood or anything like that.

234
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:40,747
Speaker 1: I like to shoot and/or slice.

235
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:42,795
Speaker 0: Well, you're gonna have to shoot slice slice.

236
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,880
Speaker 1: I like to shoot and/or slice.

237
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,228
Speaker 0: You're gonna have to shoot slice slice on the western hemisphere.

238
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:49,157
Speaker 1: In a Chinese historical drama while playing Mahjong.

239
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:49,940
Speaker 0: I'll do it in Europe.

240
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:50,645
Speaker 0: That's my game.

241
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:52,940
Speaker 0: Or in the United States cuz you're not doing it in Beijing.

242
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:59,504
Speaker 1: So I'm sure we'll see some follow-up on this once the fullness of these rules is translated.

243
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:08,920
Speaker 1: coupled with the first major studios Possibly changing their sales forecast based on whether or not some games they have in their pipeline Can actually be sold in the Chinese market.

244
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:17,123
Speaker 1: But the good news is it is technically possible now for games to be approved which was not the case for the last nine months Hmm.

245
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:25,750
Speaker 0: All I gotta say is you know people in the US who cry about free speech, you know Because some company deletes their tweets or whatever, right?

246
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:27,113
Speaker 0: This is actually.

247
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,918
Speaker 0: this is what actual censorship looks like.

248
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,990
Speaker 0: Yeah Our sentence doesn't look like that.

249
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:33,920
Speaker 0: I don't want to hear free speech out of your mouth.

250
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:38,251
Speaker 0: Okay, that if that happens that's when you go on First Amendment.

251
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:38,512
Speaker 0: right.

252
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,257
Speaker 0: if that's not happening then guess what.

253
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:51,180
Speaker 1: it's not a First Amendment But anyway things of the day, so I found a cute little documentary here.

254
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,100
Speaker 1: It's a little old but it's got all the info you need.

255
00:15:54,503 --> 00:16:04,000
Speaker 1: You may remember that when I was a kid I had my brother at a Gameboy and I Due to constantly hurrying at my parents was able to get myself a Game Gear.

256
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:09,733
Speaker 1: That the Game Gear was my main portable console for my entire childhood.

257
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:12,340
Speaker 1: the battery lasted maybe a half hour.

258
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:16,277
Speaker 0: So I usually mean the what six double A's.

259
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:22,380
Speaker 0: well So are the two packed paddle things you shoved in that had connectors that looked like six double A's.

260
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:26,159
Speaker 1: I had a paddle thing that plugged into the AC port that would last about an hour.

261
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:29,059
Speaker 1: But so as a side a side point.

262
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:37,221
Speaker 1: Actually, the reason the batteries died was because there's one battery that powers the backlight and the other batteries power the rest of the console Mm-hmm.

263
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:42,822
Speaker 1: So if you just keep rotating the batteries you can last a lot longer I know.

264
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:51,760
Speaker 1: or if you hacked it to put multiple batteries in that one spot, which I saw some people doing Or just plug it in while you play it may defeating the purpose of portability.

265
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:58,687
Speaker 1: No, because my primary use cases were in order in bed in order I am in the car and I'm a kid.

266
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:02,840
Speaker 1: a 10-minute car ride is an infinite amount of time and I need to entertain myself.

267
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:05,550
Speaker 1: And we had the cigarette lighter adapters.

268
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,932
Speaker 1: That was fine.

269
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:07,598
Speaker 0: Is that strong enough to keep it on all the time?

270
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:13,355
Speaker 1: Yeah Also at grandma's house and I don't want to play the Intellivision or the Atari plug.

271
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:25,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you say a nomad Or I am sitting somewhere without power usually for not that long like in line at Cedar Point and I played it until the batteries Died and then I was just really sad and bored.

272
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:27,640
Speaker 0: you carried it around cedar point like on roller coasters.

273
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:34,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay I had a little a little tiny backpack that had the game gear the game boy a little battery-powered fan and some water.

274
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:36,719
Speaker 1: Okay, and some vanilla extract.

275
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:43,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, why are you carrying that around the amusement park?

276
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,270
Speaker 0: for no reason.

277
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,080
Speaker 1: who are you Inspector Clouseau, what's your thing of the day?

278
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:56,520
Speaker 0: I think you just say you just mentioned in the middle extract, which is right either Accidentally in there and you're trying to be silly or you're just lying and you just try to be funny.

279
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:03,377
Speaker 1: So I carried vanilla extract with me because I would get dr Pepper to drink and I would always put a little bit of vanilla in it to make vanilla.

280
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:03,618
Speaker 1: Dr.

281
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:04,382
Speaker 0: Pepper Uh-huh.

282
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:05,106
Speaker 0: All right.

283
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:07,417
Speaker 1: I did that throughout my entire childhood thing.

284
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,951
Speaker 0: I did Spent a big money on the vanilla.

285
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:11,664
Speaker 1: Yeah How much?

286
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:14,059
Speaker 1: how much vanilla do you think I was pouring into my dr.

287
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,300
Speaker 0: Pepper?

288
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,772
Speaker 0: Did you carry a little like half teaspoon with you to measure the?

289
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:18,320
Speaker 1: no, I actually would measure it in the cap.

290
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:22,528
Speaker 0: Okay, a cat was a lot 20 ounce dr.

291
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,958
Speaker 1: Pepper smart amount anyway.

292
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:39,506
Speaker 0: So way back in the PC days like 1997 or 98 If you wanted to play some video games on your computer that you know had some advanced graphics with Windows 95 or 98 You know get some GPU action.

293
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:41,191
Speaker 0: You didn't have a lot of options.

294
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:44,300
Speaker 0: It wasn't like there was g-forces in those days, right?

295
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:45,942
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

296
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:52,566
Speaker 0: you just had to have a killer CPU like a Pentium something and it would just do all the rendering in software Which is what most people did.

297
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,939
Speaker 1: and I had a 200 megahertz Pentium.

298
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,374
Speaker 1: But if you're in video I could play these goddamn games before I had a video card.

299
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:04,240
Speaker 0: if you read video game magazines They were like, oh man, you got to buy these graphics cards and some of them weren't even video cards.

300
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:11,473
Speaker 0: I think you just put them in like a PCI or a VGA slot VGA ISA slot ISA.

301
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:20,560
Speaker 0: My first network card was ISA as was my first sound card And then they would just sort of do some work and like help out the CPU doing some GPU biz.

302
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:27,060
Speaker 0: Right, but you know, it wasn't real until we had real 3d game, which is quake the real 3d game.

303
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:35,758
Speaker 0: Yeah And there was a version of quake that was like called V quake or something that needed like this special card from a company You've never heard of and no one bought that fucking thing.

304
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,406
Speaker 0: But then there was GL quake.

305
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:44,538
Speaker 0: GL quake was revolutionary because it alright buy any video card you want as long as it uses Open GL.

306
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:55,160
Speaker 0: So now that started to be in competition where people could make cards that people could afford that supported enough of the OpenGL API So that it would actually make quake run a lot faster.

307
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,838
Speaker 1: The problem was a card that's that pretty fully supported OpenGL not affordable.

308
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:09,360
Speaker 0: now They had like a min GL which is like a small subset of the OpenGL API that quake would actually, you know, use any disclosure.

309
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:15,858
Speaker 1: I used to know a lot more about this because in this era it mattered to me a lot.

310
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:18,946
Speaker 1: the point is nowadays I just don't remember any of the cards.

311
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:22,617
Speaker 0: at the time was the 3d fx voodoo cup.

312
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,366
Speaker 1: in my Personal opinion when I was a kid.

313
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:29,480
Speaker 1: I always thought those voodoo cards were garbage pieces of shit because they had bad color.

314
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,585
Speaker 0: There's all these problems.

315
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,313
Speaker 0: by the time that I was buying video cards.

316
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:40,145
Speaker 1: I bought a TNT - I didn't Got a creative graphics blaster extreme anyway 400 bucks for that thing.

317
00:20:40,345 --> 00:20:44,440
Speaker 0: I paid like 300 pre-ordered the TNT - for like three or four hundred anyway.

318
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:48,545
Speaker 0: the point is Someone here wrote up.

319
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:49,468
Speaker 0: What's the person's name?

320
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:51,456
Speaker 0: Oh, this is real reason.

321
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:52,540
Speaker 0: This is written like a week ago.

322
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,685
Speaker 1: Fabian sang a lard.

323
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:56,993
Speaker 0: Fabian sang lard wrote this like a week ago.

324
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:59,080
Speaker 0: There's amazing published a week ago.

325
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:04,856
Speaker 0: It's amazing write-up of like every detail of the voodoo card and what the deal with them was.

326
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:06,160
Speaker 1: it's kind of amazing.

327
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:17,065
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read this whole thing right for anyone who wasn't there then or was there then and wants to go down memory lane Or fill in the holes in your knowledge of what the deal was then Fabian's got you covered.

328
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:20,621
Speaker 0: It's also amazing to see quotes from Tom's Hardware in 1997.

329
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:29,040
Speaker 1: that site is still going as far as I know Dude, I just found on a Nantec a review of the creative graphics blaster extreme.

330
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:30,039
Speaker 0: From what year?

331
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,952
Speaker 0: 1997. and Nantec is that old and they kept their content up.

332
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:34,854
Speaker 0: good job in it.

333
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:41,214
Speaker 1: Oh, they used a Pentium 3 MMX they're eight years older than geek nights with an.

334
00:21:41,314 --> 00:21:47,019
Speaker 1: a open motherboard Was 64 megabytes of RAM which back then was a shit ton of RAM.

335
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:54,280
Speaker 0: Wow, but yeah, if you're wondering, you know, you think the state of video cards and GPUs nowadays is bad.

336
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:55,626
Speaker 1: Yeah, dude in the old days.

337
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,360
Speaker 1: You'd buy a video card with like a voodoo card.

338
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,951
Speaker 1: You'd need like the glide wrapper to make a game.

339
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:02,799
Speaker 1: That was just OpenGL even work.

340
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:10,658
Speaker 1: So like you had to know a lot about the games you were buying and the individual video cards And you had to do a bunch of fuckery to make them work.

341
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:14,660
Speaker 1: You couldn't just buy quake and if you had a better video card, it just looked better.

342
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:24,669
Speaker 0: I just remember every game I would install and it would give me three choices glide which I knew was only for voodoo cards which I didn't have and then OpenGL and DirectX and I knew that I had both.

343
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:34,300
Speaker 0: well DirectX slash direct 3d and I knew I had both of those because I Windows 98 SE and I had a TNT - I could choose either one of those and I choose whichever one seemed better.

344
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:35,927
Speaker 0: They I couldn't didn't really notice a difference.

345
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:39,039
Speaker 0: They're both fine because my computer was so OP at the time.

346
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:46,177
Speaker 0: Yeah my computer was 99 my computer was not Opie at the time because I was gonna brought the computer to RIT and it became not OP.

347
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:54,524
Speaker 1: I was still using that 200 megahertz to the as Late as right before I went to RIT And then I bought.

348
00:22:54,584 --> 00:23:00,529
Speaker 1: I sold all my bonds and I used all that money to buy one Computer that I used while I was in college.

349
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:03,340
Speaker 1: Anyway, so we're gonna review all in the meta moment.

350
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,349
Speaker 1: The geek nice book club book is a painful book.

351
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,294
Speaker 1: It is pages of pain.

352
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:10,220
Speaker 0: I have read some painful pages.

353
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:13,952
Speaker 1: I also started reading some painful pages few chapters of pain.

354
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:15,476
Speaker 0: I am feeling the pain.

355
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:20,592
Speaker 1: Yeah, the prose is Better than a typical branded.

356
00:23:20,752 --> 00:23:22,500
Speaker 1: our book based on a franchise.

357
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:25,353
Speaker 0: I will say this they gave the main character two names.

358
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:31,174
Speaker 0: They named him at the threson Yep, and I assume it's a him and also named him the amnesiac hero.

359
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:35,365
Speaker 0: and basically every paragraph is Alternating between those two names.

360
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,311
Speaker 0: and it's since it's like this narrator.

361
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:42,091
Speaker 0: It's the amnesiac hero did xxx the blah blah blah blah blah blah.

362
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:43,739
Speaker 0: the threson did X blah blah blah.

363
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,525
Speaker 0: the Hero did X blah blah blah.

364
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:46,347
Speaker 0: the threson did it.

365
00:23:46,387 --> 00:23:50,860
Speaker 0: and just alternating between the two names and every sentence structure is the so-and-so.

366
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:54,722
Speaker 1: He's gonna get a third name if I recall correctly I'm sure.

367
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:57,169
Speaker 1: what's the tiefling if you met her yet?

368
00:23:57,209 --> 00:23:59,194
Speaker 1: Yes, she calls him zombie.

369
00:23:59,214 --> 00:23:59,295
Speaker 1: Yeah.

370
00:23:59,615 --> 00:24:00,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

371
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:02,304
Speaker 0: Zoom me I just read that literally.

372
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:04,773
Speaker 0: just read that zoom on the train just now.

373
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,058
Speaker 0: That was the ding.

374
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:09,380
Speaker 1: I just read So yeah, we're gonna talk about that book anyway.

375
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,288
Speaker 1: Otherwise bunch of our panels are on YouTube.

376
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:18,992
Speaker 1: the real harm of games rare game mechanics and The most recent judging of anime all three can be yours.

377
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,056
Speaker 0: I just judged.

378
00:24:20,257 --> 00:24:21,100
Speaker 0: I finished that judge.

379
00:24:22,382 --> 00:24:22,804
Speaker 0: It was all good.

380
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:23,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, good stuff.

381
00:24:24,271 --> 00:24:26,120
Speaker 0: So it's not a good anime coming this season, by the way.

382
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,614
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got no cons until anime Boston just happened.

383
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:31,160
Speaker 0: It seemed like it was good, but we weren't there.

384
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,967
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I'll go back next year.

385
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:34,352
Speaker 0: We'll see the security though.

386
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:35,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the problem.

387
00:24:36,118 --> 00:24:41,440
Speaker 1: other than that I think I'm more inclined to just go back to Connecticut because Connecticut is does not have the security problem.

388
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,263
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll have it though.

389
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:43,468
Speaker 1: I doubt it.

390
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:45,074
Speaker 0: Anyway, I highly doubt it.

391
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:47,809
Speaker 0: So we were at PAX East and at PAX East We play a lot of games.

392
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:50,626
Speaker 0: Yep, and We could talk about a lot of those games.

393
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:53,860
Speaker 0: But today we're just gonna talk about two that we played back to back.

394
00:24:54,922 --> 00:25:02,987
Speaker 0: Basically, we're sitting there on Sunday We got some time before the Omega thon and I you know in my wanderings of tabletop working in there I had noticed a few games.

395
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,835
Speaker 0: So I went over to the library.

396
00:25:04,895 --> 00:25:05,498
Speaker 0: I grabbed one.

397
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:05,980
Speaker 0: we played it.

398
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,740
Speaker 0: I went returned it grabbed the other one and we played it because they were quick and they looked like a lot of fun.

399
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:14,876
Speaker 0: They looked easy to learn and they were dexterity grabby games.

400
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:19,713
Speaker 0: and we had the circle table Which was great for dexterity grabby games and they were both pretty good.

401
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:24,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the first one It's called catch the moon and basically from 2017.

402
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:25,896
Speaker 1: It's a recent game.

403
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:26,960
Speaker 0: Both of these are recent games.

404
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,985
Speaker 0: The other one was 2018.

405
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,980
Speaker 1: It was a nominee for the cardboard republic socializer Laurel.

406
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:49,976
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you know our opinion on stacking games like Jenga or via Paletti or the Rhino hero Or any stacking balance games most of the ones that we've played right sort of have the same similar Mechanical problems not in terms of the fun of the stacking or the skill of the stacking that

407
00:25:49,996 --> 00:25:51,019
Speaker 1: parts off that bright

408
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:51,440
Speaker 0: solid.

409
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,345
Speaker 0: It's really easy to do that.

410
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:53,833
Speaker 1: It's not via Paletti with the hook.

411
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:55,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love that hook.

412
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,285
Speaker 0: It's super fun and solid.

413
00:25:56,305 --> 00:26:01,268
Speaker 0: the problem is the the victory conditions and the actual rules For winning and losing.

414
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:02,940
Speaker 0: a lot of these games are very flawed.

415
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of them are.

416
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:08,237
Speaker 0: you make it fall down you lose everyone else wins, but that's unsatisfied.

417
00:26:08,257 --> 00:26:09,160
Speaker 0: It's very unsatisfying.

418
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,410
Speaker 0: There's a lot of turn order determines who wins.

419
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,630
Speaker 0: it's like a lady right a Jenga tower will become Destabilized on about the X turns.

420
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,815
Speaker 0: you have this many players.

421
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:21,365
Speaker 0: you want to have turn X To be so.

422
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,734
Speaker 0: that way it'll be the most stable on your turn.

423
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:26,549
Speaker 1: games like via Paletti that run out It's really just satisfying.

424
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,260
Speaker 0: if turn order is what determines It's like aha it became unstable on the turn before yours.

425
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,684
Speaker 1: So you lose regardless of your actual pulling skills and turn order wouldn't matter that much except Stacking games.

426
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:42,778
Speaker 1: if people get good at stacking then a turn order is the only thing left to determine who wins.

427
00:26:42,858 --> 00:26:48,916
Speaker 0: and it's also Dissatisfying because most of them involve, you know balancing and shakiness and then a thing collapsing.

428
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:51,204
Speaker 0: and when the thing collapses It's like well GG.

429
00:26:51,244 --> 00:26:52,147
Speaker 0: This isn't.

430
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:52,869
Speaker 0: we can't continue.

431
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:53,712
Speaker 0: We don't have anything left.

432
00:26:53,973 --> 00:27:05,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this game we played catch the moon I'm not gonna say it perfectly solves all those problems But it does go a long way towards solving them and it tries to solve them and for that I give it a lot of Credit plus.

433
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:08,712
Speaker 0: it's still really fun to fiddle with this game because what this game is?

434
00:27:08,732 --> 00:27:13,900
Speaker 0: it is a game of balancing little wooden ladders And they're all shaped slightly differently.

435
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,345
Speaker 0: It's a bunch of little wooden ladders.

436
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:18,036
Speaker 0: you start the game with two straight ones in this plastic cloud.

437
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:22,528
Speaker 0: that sort of keeps them erect And there's a lot of different starting positions for the two starting ladders.

438
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,738
Speaker 0: and then you roll some dice or something like.

439
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:25,918
Speaker 0: that.

440
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:26,460
Speaker 0: is dice, right?

441
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,680
Speaker 0: Yes, and they tell you how you have to place your ladder.

442
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,732
Speaker 0: It's like your ladder has to be exactly touching one other ladder.

443
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:48,636
Speaker 0: two other ladders, you know It's like there's a rule about how you have to place your ladder But as long as you follow that rule The other the important thing is one your ladder has to have some part of it higher in Elevation than all the existing ladders.

444
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:53,763
Speaker 1: in the thing You nominate one of your hands as your grabby hand and you can't ever touch anything with anything But that hand.

445
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:54,968
Speaker 0: yeah, you gotta use one hand only.

446
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:57,297
Speaker 1: but here's a difference.

447
00:27:57,337 --> 00:27:58,727
Speaker 0: random ladder You can't choose one.

448
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,236
Speaker 1: most stacking games have rules Like you can't fuck with the structure like you can't fuck with parts of the Jenga.

449
00:28:04,256 --> 00:28:05,340
Speaker 1: You're not actively moving.

450
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:14,948
Speaker 1: Yep in this game You can do whatever the hell you want to the structure as long as you only use one hand and you only touch it with The ladder you're about to play.

451
00:28:14,968 --> 00:28:17,138
Speaker 0: you can't put your hands on the existing ladders.

452
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:18,204
Speaker 0: only your ladder you're placing.

453
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:30,579
Speaker 1: as long as you do not break it or Touch the cloud or the table with the ladder in your hand Drop the ladder in your hand or break the rule of placement like touching too many at the same time.

454
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:32,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can eat the dice.

455
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:41,336
Speaker 1: Yeah As long as you obey the dice you can fuck with it as much as you want to get it on there and you might think Well, wouldn't we just make a really ugly weird structure?

456
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:42,804
Speaker 1: Hell, yeah Yeah, that's right.

457
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:43,950
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of crazy shit.

458
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:44,292
Speaker 0: You can do.

459
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:45,820
Speaker 0: the instruction book is actually really good.

460
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:52,540
Speaker 0: It shows you a lot of different possible ways of placing your ladder and even names them and different techniques with funny names.

461
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,548
Speaker 1: Right the shameful something we use.

462
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,857
Speaker 0: we use the shameful whatever the shameful whatever it is.

463
00:28:58,977 --> 00:29:02,469
Speaker 0: many many times You just lay a ladder flat on top of another ladder.

464
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:02,831
Speaker 0: Yep.

465
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:04,457
Speaker 0: We did that frequently.

466
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:06,180
Speaker 1: Oh my god We had no shame.

467
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:16,196
Speaker 1: We had a game where there were four like shameful stacks in a row and then like another structure and then another Three higher up on the shameful support the shameful support.

468
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:18,160
Speaker 0: So he did that a lot anyway.

469
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:21,119
Speaker 0: But yeah, this game is a ton of fun.

470
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:25,416
Speaker 0: the one thing that makes it really good is that let's say you fuck up on your turn.

471
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:29,940
Speaker 0: you go and you try to Put your ladder and you end up knocking over a shit ton of ladders.

472
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:31,527
Speaker 1: Well the way it works that you can't.

473
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:34,160
Speaker 1: there's no way to make the entire thing just collapse.

474
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:37,260
Speaker 0: Let's say I go to place my ladder and a whole bunch of ladders fall off.

475
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:38,739
Speaker 0: I just I just mess up real bad.

476
00:29:39,282 --> 00:29:42,094
Speaker 0: All right, I scoop up all those ladders and just put them in front of me.

477
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:43,560
Speaker 0: they're now negative points.

478
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:44,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't lose.

479
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:48,539
Speaker 0: the game doesn't continue term order doesn't determine the victory or anything like that.

480
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:52,231
Speaker 0: We just keep going and it's like you can still keep having fun.

481
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:57,488
Speaker 1: The game doesn't end disappointingly, but you also get Hobbs are disappointed in you.

482
00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:13,320
Speaker 0: There is a clear winner at the end and it's more likely that the winner is going to be the person with the best ladder placing skill as opposed to the person with The most luck or seat position or anything like that because I think that makes it a much more satisfying dexterity.

483
00:30:13,864 --> 00:30:14,328
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

484
00:30:14,368 --> 00:30:26,459
Speaker 1: if I recall correctly the rule is When the game ends meaning all the ladders have either been placed or been fucked up in some way Then whoever has the least tears yep wins the game because they fucked up the least yep.

485
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:33,280
Speaker 1: If multiple people are tied then with tears then whoever has the least ladders wins the game.

486
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,080
Speaker 0: So this game is like and the game also ends when you run out of ladders, I think right?

487
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like you place all the ladders you're gonna have the same number of turns.

488
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:44,071
Speaker 0: You can also have a ton of players going in this game.

489
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:46,020
Speaker 0: Why does it go to like eight players on the ridiculous?

490
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,753
Speaker 1: I forget we played with varying numbers of players and it always worked.

491
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:49,959
Speaker 0: I think six players.

492
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,307
Speaker 0: Yep It goes to six which is best.

493
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:52,979
Speaker 1: three to four, which I could see right?

494
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,409
Speaker 0: Yeah It's definitely best of three to four.

495
00:30:54,469 --> 00:31:03,660
Speaker 0: but yeah, cuz you're gonna get you know If you play with too many players, it'll still be just fine as a game But there'll be a lot of waiting and as a fewer turns per person which will make it less fun.

496
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:06,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but otherwise the game will still be solid even with six players.

497
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:08,507
Speaker 1: So I feel like this.

498
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:12,692
Speaker 1: I feel like I want to buy it because it is the best second game for us I've found.

499
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:14,939
Speaker 0: yet I do like it.

500
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:21,871
Speaker 0: But I feel like you want to just want to take these advances in stacking game rules And apply them to a even better stacking game.

501
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:28,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, the trouble is a lot of the stacking games I like the most are such that if someone fucks up the entire thing is likely to collapse.

502
00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:35,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what if it's via plenty and it's like, okay If you knock something over you take all those cylinder as a place to get a teardrop or something?

503
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,321
Speaker 0: I don't know.

504
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:43,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, just take these innovations and apply them to the to the genre to push it forward From where it is now.

505
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:50,927
Speaker 1: Yeah props to Fabian Rifard and Juan Rodriguez for advancing the genre of Stacking dexterity tabletop games.

506
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:51,348
Speaker 1: Yep.

507
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:55,380
Speaker 1: Like I don't know if you realized you were solving these fundamental problems of the genre.

508
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:02,200
Speaker 1: You solved like the Primary things we've complained about for more than a decade in the stacking genre.

509
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:13,400
Speaker 0: It also goes to show you you know Someone like me sits there and looks at like a flaw in a game and like is like I'll make a game that fixes this And I'll think about ideas and I got won't unless I got the perfect solution.

510
00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:14,949
Speaker 0: It's like nope, not good enough where it's like.

511
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,940
Speaker 0: they're just like yeah good enough solution.

512
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:20,478
Speaker 0: They put it out there and they publish it and they actually make something.

513
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:21,948
Speaker 0: Yep It's good.

514
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:26,972
Speaker 0: and if someone talks about it on a podcast Or something to me sits there and still thinking of like it's not perfect.

515
00:32:27,835 --> 00:32:31,243
Speaker 1: So this other game we played Volfasten well, I don't.

516
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:33,249
Speaker 0: yeah, sorry about the German pronunciation.

517
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,378
Speaker 0: It's vol vo ll pfo sten.

518
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:37,120
Speaker 0: It's all one word.

519
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,304
Speaker 0: What does it mean in German?

520
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:39,891
Speaker 0: It means idiot poll.

521
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:42,340
Speaker 0: Someone said some someone said it means idiot poll.

522
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,123
Speaker 0: They tweeted at us.

523
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:46,636
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I saw them playing this at PAX.

524
00:32:46,676 --> 00:32:47,840
Speaker 0: They have these turn in tabletop.

525
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,162
Speaker 0: They have these tournaments at night use like like Saturday night showdown stuff like that where you sign up for this tournament And you show

526
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:54,644
Speaker 1: up not

527
00:32:54,684 --> 00:33:06,207
Speaker 0: knowing what games are about to be played and you just sometimes you're even playing different games other people in the same round of the tournament and you know you play and you play and you try to just it's just who's good at Games, who knows what these games are gonna be?

528
00:33:06,328 --> 00:33:14,340
Speaker 0: only the people who run tabletop know those games are gonna have Time and I saw in a later a very late round possibly a final round of one of these tournaments.

529
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:18,019
Speaker 0: People are playing this game and I remember what the box looked like.

530
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:26,809
Speaker 0: So I went and got it from the library and this game is vol Fausten idiot poll or something Whatever, it's basically advanced jungle speed.

531
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:27,792
Speaker 0: It's advanced.

532
00:33:27,893 --> 00:33:30,019
Speaker 0: It's sort of advanced sort of not advanced.

533
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:35,299
Speaker 0: Yeah So the way it works is there are five poles or six poles three four or five six.

534
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:40,040
Speaker 0: There are six sticks and each stick has a lot of different factors.

535
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:50,812
Speaker 0: They each contain on the top of the stick their square Rectangular like tall sticks like I don't you know, whatever a die face Is a die face from one to six.

536
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:52,200
Speaker 0: then on the side?

537
00:33:52,640 --> 00:34:02,620
Speaker 0: There is a picture of an animal a letter to the alphabet a number of sticks a number of just sticks like like hash marks Like someone was scratching out the date because they were in prison.

538
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:06,892
Speaker 0: Yeah a shape and a polygon right a polygon of some kind.

539
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:12,559
Speaker 0: and then you get a whole bunch of dice and you choose which Dice you're gonna use when you play the game, right?

540
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,824
Speaker 0: so we chose.

541
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:17,116
Speaker 0: we decided to use the simple dice because of just the situation we were in.

542
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:19,123
Speaker 0: and You what?

543
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:27,350
Speaker 0: we roll the dice and the dice tell you which totem to grab What to do depending on which dice you use, right?

544
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, some dice tell you which totem to grab.

545
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:30,839
Speaker 0: the white one I think yep.

546
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,860
Speaker 0: Some tell you how to grab it how to grab the totem and some tell you what to do before you grab the totem.

547
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:48,860
Speaker 0: Right, yeah, so you could end up a situation where it's like, okay, you got a clap then you got to grab a totem You got to grab it in between like your index in your ring.

548
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:51,139
Speaker 0: You're like your two hands the backs of your two hands.

549
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,103
Speaker 1: that's the worst one.

550
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:59,271
Speaker 0: and then you win if you get the totem with like the What the biggest animal on it or something?

551
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:01,780
Speaker 0: So it depends on the animal with the most legs.

552
00:35:01,864 --> 00:35:11,533
Speaker 1: Yeah so the factors are like you're shooting for the highest number of One of the attributes which might be either the Sometimes the row gets reversed.

553
00:35:11,553 --> 00:35:12,940
Speaker 0: You may be going for animal with the least leg.

554
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,707
Speaker 1: So one die says the factor.

555
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:16,614
Speaker 1: so like you're looking for your by default.

556
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:18,160
Speaker 1: The factor is the die face.

557
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,447
Speaker 1: You're looking for the highest die face.

558
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:21,580
Speaker 1: The factor is the polygon.

559
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,158
Speaker 1: You're looking for the polygon with the most sides.

560
00:35:23,461 --> 00:35:31,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, if the factor is the animal you're gonna for the animal with the most legs But the orange die might modify that and say no you're looking for the opposite of that.

561
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, now I need the animal the least legs the snake.

562
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:35,540
Speaker 0: the snake has one leg, right?

563
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:39,120
Speaker 0: So obviously all the all the sticks are mixed up right zero legs.

564
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:48,500
Speaker 0: I said like the stick with the letter a on it Which should be the best stick if you had alphabet ranking reversed, right has the number two on top of it.

565
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:55,238
Speaker 0: So if you were right, so when you're any octopus with the second most legs, yep, so and the hexagon Yep.

566
00:35:55,764 --> 00:36:04,700
Speaker 0: So it's like every third Situations based on the dice that come up where every stick basically has an equal chance of being the best stick for any given die.

567
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:08,336
Speaker 0: So you don't know until seeing the die which stick you want to grab.

568
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:11,600
Speaker 0: not only that But you know, you might be too slow.

569
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,880
Speaker 0: You might not have grabbed the best stick because you were a little slower than the person who did grab the best stick.

570
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:19,154
Speaker 0: And in that case the second best stick is now the best stick.

571
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:20,540
Speaker 0: There's actually ranking involved.

572
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,640
Speaker 0: It's not just like so whoever grabs it wins and everyone else loses.

573
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,820
Speaker 1: So everybody grabs and then you evaluate did you grab it the right way anyone who grabbed it the wrong way?

574
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,427
Speaker 1: They're just eliminated, right?

575
00:36:30,447 --> 00:36:43,120
Speaker 0: So there are actually a lot of cases where it's like, okay maybe it was, you know clap and grab it with your wrong hand and You grab the worst possible stick But everyone else either forgot to clap or grabbed it with their normal hand.

576
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:51,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you're sitting there with the shittiest stick but in your you did everything else, right you win you get the most points Yeah, so you get first place second place third place, right?

577
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,320
Speaker 0: So the the score keeping is actually pretty clever.

578
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:56,709
Speaker 0: basically If you win around you get three points.

579
00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:58,135
Speaker 0: if you come in second you get two points.

580
00:36:58,175 --> 00:36:59,140
Speaker 0: if you come in last you get one.

581
00:36:59,441 --> 00:37:05,031
Speaker 0: You can only score points if you actually Successfully grab something right?

582
00:37:05,052 --> 00:37:09,330
Speaker 0: So there could be situations where now Three everyone else get zero way this going works.

583
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,080
Speaker 1: is you get a long stick a medium stick or a short stick, right?

584
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,540
Speaker 1: At the end of the game you make your idiot pole from all the sticks.

585
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Speaker 0: Whoever is really just a really clever score sheet to have these little wooden sticks that are Length one two and three except the gray sticks are about a millimeter.

586
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,159
Speaker 0: Complaining about the manufacturing precision of the stick?

587
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:38,018
Speaker 1: No, but they were consistently so and if I was losing by a millimeter I would say that I had lost there one two and three.

588
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:40,066
Speaker 0: Stop being pedantic rules.

589
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:42,053
Speaker 0: Say you saw the laying that guy's.

590
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:44,040
Speaker 1: stop making up your own rules for games.

591
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,900
Speaker 0: Stop being that guy complaining about the manufacturing position.

592
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:48,747
Speaker 1: Who says I complained?

593
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:50,476
Speaker 1: I said that that is part of the designers.

594
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:55,606
Speaker 0: No, it is not one two and three - I say it is obvious.

595
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,720
Speaker 1: a second place in the third place is not as long as a first place.

596
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,267
Speaker 1: I would say the first place breaks that tie.

597
00:38:00,388 --> 00:38:00,910
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

598
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,272
Speaker 0: by

599
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,120
Speaker 1: the written rules of this game

600
00:38:04,805 --> 00:38:17,307
Speaker 0: You save a lot of time adding up your score with apps or calculators or anything like that Because you can just lay out all your store sticks in a big long line and whoever's score stick total score Stick is the longest is the winner.

601
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:20,179
Speaker 0: It's a really fun and clever scoring mechanism.

602
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:30,565
Speaker 0: Mechanically speaking that doesn't involve math And matches the theme of the game of idiot pole because you're grabbing poles and also using an idiot pole to keep score And that's really clever and fun.

603
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:33,573
Speaker 1: The game is actually very difficult.

604
00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:35,418
Speaker 0: Yes, it is way hard.

605
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,807
Speaker 0: We're like, oh, yeah We're advanced.

606
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:37,940
Speaker 0: Let's use some advanced dice.

607
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,280
Speaker 1: So if you think you're good at jungle speed and you'll be good at this now.

608
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:44,814
Speaker 0: So some of them involve like standing up turning around and see.

609
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:48,060
Speaker 0: so if your environment isn't good It's not really great for this game.

610
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:54,384
Speaker 0: You want to be in a situation where you're at a table where everyone can reach the whole table without getting up Yep, right with their arms.

611
00:38:54,404 --> 00:39:01,611
Speaker 0: You need a small circular table relatively speaking maybe like a cocktail situation But you want it low so everyone can sit in chairs.

612
00:39:01,912 --> 00:39:09,800
Speaker 0: and plus you need room because to be able to get up and run Around the chairs depending on which dice you use you can always use the simpler dice and avoid those scenarios.

613
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,319
Speaker 0: Either table is suboptimal, which is what we did.

614
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:20,223
Speaker 0: Yeah But I think if you really want to get the most out of this game You need that perfect environment where everyone's sitting around Equidistant.

615
00:39:20,243 --> 00:39:24,920
Speaker 0: you can all grab this the sticks because you can't arrange the sticks all right in the middle of the table.

616
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:26,178
Speaker 0: They need some space between them.

617
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, so naturally speaking some sticks are gonna be closer to some players that sometimes and sometimes not.

618
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:39,863
Speaker 0: But if your table small enough and everyone's sitting close enough that won't really matter because all the other stuff is really what's gonna determine The winning and the losing.

619
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:42,391
Speaker 1: and unlike jungle speed we're very like.

620
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:50,212
Speaker 1: very often two people grab the totem at the same time and you needed to come up with a like Specific way to resolve that situation.

621
00:39:50,734 --> 00:39:52,000
Speaker 1: that isn't just violence.

622
00:39:52,742 --> 00:40:00,189
Speaker 1: This game has the same problem, but it happens less often because most of the time Someone does just figure out what to grab.

623
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,097
Speaker 0: yes jungle speed has the problem.

624
00:40:02,157 --> 00:40:02,800
Speaker 0: so often it.

625
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,960
Speaker 0: So it puts in a bunch of rules for like okay, whoever's lower on the totem?

626
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,565
Speaker 0: We're just got more fingers on the totem.

627
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:12,620
Speaker 0: wherever has the totem right by any means necessary right in this one.

628
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:16,170
Speaker 0: Cut out a lot of those rules because it happens so rarely.

629
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:17,795
Speaker 0: you don't really need those rules.

630
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:22,423
Speaker 0: if you're a mature adult It won't happen But you're better off Grabbing a diff.

631
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:30,015
Speaker 0: right if you're gonna you would better off not fighting with the person for the top stick and is grabbing another stick Before someone else grabs it.

632
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:31,183
Speaker 1: yeah I would.

633
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:34,360
Speaker 0: there's no reason that if you're fighting over a stick that is poor strategy.

634
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,034
Speaker 1: Well it does have a. the problem is occasionally three times in our game Which is a small number compared to the number of like throws every single.

635
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:46,420
Speaker 1: yeah three times Two people grabbed the same stick at the same time, and there's no way to resolve it.

636
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:56,300
Speaker 1: But if you just come up with a simple rule because the rules do say you cannot pry it out of someone else's hand So I think you could do the jungle speed rule of whoever's holding it lower wins right?

637
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,970
Speaker 0: I give just basically like you can tell like it's in your hand.

638
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:00,817
Speaker 0: You're trying to pry it therefore.

639
00:41:00,857 --> 00:41:01,559
Speaker 0: You don't get it.

640
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's sort of obvious.

641
00:41:03,012 --> 00:41:03,860
Speaker 0: in most scenarios.

642
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,900
Speaker 0: There were two the one who's the prior and who's the price twice me and Pat?

643
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,327
Speaker 1: We're both holding it at the same time And we both had a grip on it.

644
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:15,677
Speaker 0: with the right hand with the right hand the right manner We do we do after doing the right thing yep.

645
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,223
Speaker 1: So that's.

646
00:41:17,243 --> 00:41:26,480
Speaker 1: the only thing I would add is just come up with a very simple rule of if two people hold it Whoever's holding it closer to the bottom gets it like something like that just in case and then you're good.

647
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Speaker 0: I mean you could also if you really want to just put your phone up And then if you set your phone nearby recording you could see who grabbed it first with some instant replay.

648
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,404
Speaker 1: Oh, we should do that.

649
00:41:34,424 --> 00:41:36,636
Speaker 0: for jungle speed you should make an instant replay app.

650
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:40,240
Speaker 0: It's like oh Add is to replace your whole life.

651
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,514
Speaker 0: Just put this phone on the little tripod and turn this app on.

652
00:41:43,674 --> 00:41:44,960
Speaker 1: that is not a bad idea.

653
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:53,098
Speaker 0: Keep continuously recording for like you know a minute And then if you ever need an instant replay you can just actually all my cameras like the cameras will do that.

654
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:54,684
Speaker 1: hmm They have a continuous mode.

655
00:41:54,824 --> 00:41:55,466
Speaker 1: yeah that purpose.

656
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:56,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

657
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:59,619
Speaker 1: Maybe we should start doing that when we play dexterity games, okay?

658
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:00,901
Speaker 0: We'll see.

659
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:04,294
Speaker 0: we'll slow it down as fast as the highest frame rate and see who grabbed it first.

660
00:42:04,495 --> 00:42:07,607
Speaker 1: so I would say and Both Faustin is from 2018.

661
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:08,991
Speaker 1: They're both pretty recent games.

662
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:14,568
Speaker 0: Sorry German people yep and German speakers Hansa toy tonica.

663
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:15,009
Speaker 0: anyway.

664
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:21,851
Speaker 1: anyway these games are both pretty good Both worth getting if you want like dexterity games on the table.

665
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:25,844
Speaker 1: They are both like way above average for that genre Mm-hmm there.

666
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:28,759
Speaker 1: neither one of them is great, but they are both very good and very fun.

667
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:32,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know where you're gonna get a copy of all Faustin or or the other.

668
00:42:33,723 --> 00:42:35,197
Speaker 0: Both these games might be hard to find.

669
00:42:35,237 --> 00:42:40,499
Speaker 0: yeah They're the kind of games you're gonna have to either like import or trade someone or something like that.

670
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:45,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, dude Vol Faustin there are only four pictures of it in board game geek.

671
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:49,493
Speaker 1: like I have more pictures of this game on my cell phone That are on board game geek.

672
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:52,453
Speaker 0: yeah So sorry your photos to board game geek.

673
00:42:52,694 --> 00:42:53,398
Speaker 1: I think I should.

674
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:56,739
Speaker 1: yeah Sorry, we reviewed two games that are great that you probably can't play.

675
00:42:57,321 --> 00:43:00,571
Speaker 0: Imagine the vol Faustin might get an American release or not.

676
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,360
Speaker 1: you couldn't make vol Faustin pretty easily.

677
00:43:03,704 --> 00:43:04,900
Speaker 0: You could just make a vol Faustin.

678
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,077
Speaker 0: You just need a wood shop to make the the wooden sticks, and then you could just wood shop.

679
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:11,300
Speaker 1: just buy squared squared.

680
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:15,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could buy a square Wouldn't stick?

681
00:43:15,744 --> 00:43:16,507
Speaker 0: and then just chop it.

682
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:20,382
Speaker 1: you need a dremel and us and one Square.

683
00:43:20,483 --> 00:43:22,530
Speaker 0: go to the hardware store get one piece of wood.

684
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,220
Speaker 0: That's the right shape and just cut it the right lengths.

685
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,351
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know six inch five inch four inch three inch whatever.

686
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:30,780
Speaker 0: I guess I guess I'd do seven six five four three two

687
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like maybe

688
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:39,079
Speaker 0: eight seven six five four three one inch in between each and then get a bunch of dice and draw on Them and then you're good, and you're good to go and you get the rulebook from the internet.

689
00:43:45,264 --> 00:43:52,716
