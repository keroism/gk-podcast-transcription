1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,792
Speaker 1: It's Thursday August 2nd 2018.

2
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:12,213
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:14,139
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:23,000
Speaker 1: tonight We're bringing back a long-running geek night series how to not suck at things with how to not suck at the beach.

5
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:26,816
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:31,580
Speaker 1: Yesterday I come home, and I do some stuff that plays them overwatch.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:40,467
Speaker 1: I'm doing a bunch of chores like I'm doing my things and I smell a smell that I haven't smelled in a long time poison just a little bit poop.

8
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:46,390
Speaker 1: the best way I'll describe It's a smell that in the modern era all for you never smell anymore.

9
00:00:47,231 --> 00:01:00,613
Speaker 1: It's the smell of you know when you have an incandescent bulb that's covered in dust how it'll have this sort of like Slightly burning dust smell if it's on a long time or like you turn it on and it hasn't been turned on in a long Time like like.

10
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,703
Speaker 1: that's the smell from my childhood that I don't encounter anymore cuz literally every light bulb.

11
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:15,030
Speaker 1: well with the exception of two Xenon but nobody cares every other light bulb in my apartment, so I thought was either a CFL or mostly LEDs.

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:23,769
Speaker 1: so uh I Think like I'm thinking like I'm gonna find that smell later And then eventually I get some groceries and I opened the fridge and I found the smell.

13
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:30,090
Speaker 1: So the fridge door had closed and in fact the seal around the edge was like touching.

14
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:34,875
Speaker 1: But the door was held a tiny bit open And I cannot identify what.

15
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:40,130
Speaker 1: held the door open and held it open just enough to leave the lights on in the fridge.

16
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:42,736
Speaker 1: Those two light bulbs.

17
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:49,702
Speaker 1: There's two not one are both 40 watt incandescent fucking bulbs And they basically cooked everything in the top half of the fridge.

18
00:01:49,722 --> 00:01:51,708
Speaker 1: I had to throw away almost everything in the fridge.

19
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:56,363
Speaker 1: Yeah Luckily a lot of the stuff was kind of old so I didn't feel too bad about it.

20
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:03,210
Speaker 1: and the bottom of the fridge cuz The fridge was just cooling the whole time was cool enough to wear like all the veggies and all that stuff was fine.

21
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,636
Speaker 1: So I lost some meat.

22
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:09,475
Speaker 1: I lost some old sauces, and I lost all the like dairy Related product.

23
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:13,550
Speaker 0: like all the dairy adjacent will throw food away like the drop of a hat when it's perfectly fine.

24
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,630
Speaker 1: So would you if your fridge for an entire day was well above the FTA approved temperature keep some?

25
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,900
Speaker 1: Like nearing room temperature ground beef.

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,562
Speaker 0: I check it.

27
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:25,324
Speaker 1: What do you?

28
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,046
Speaker 1: how would you check it?

29
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:26,768
Speaker 0: check it?

30
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,270
Speaker 1: Yeah?

31
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:28,050
Speaker 1: What would you do?

32
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,552
Speaker 1: What is your?

33
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:32,090
Speaker 1: what would you do to determine whether or not this?

34
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:39,110
Speaker 1: Nearing brown room temperature ground beef that has been at this temperature for an unknown amount of time is safe.

35
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,331
Speaker 1: What?

36
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:40,476
Speaker 1: what is the thing you will do?

37
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:43,810
Speaker 0: well first of all right the longest it could have been at that temperature would be?

38
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,061
Speaker 0: Like since you left in the morning.

39
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:45,849
Speaker 1: so like eight hours.

40
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:49,450
Speaker 1: That's way above what was okay when I worked at that restaurant.

41
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,003
Speaker 0: I mean if I take some you know I might have.

42
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:57,994
Speaker 0: you've got some food And it's currently cold and from the fridge or freezer I take it out leave it on the counter for eight hours And then cook it.

43
00:02:58,215 --> 00:03:04,585
Speaker 0: I would not leave ground beef on the counter for eight hours To that you know to get it to room temperature for cooking cuz you don't want to cook it when it's cold.

44
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,208
Speaker 0: right that's perfectly Okay, so maybe I cook it right away.

45
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:12,028
Speaker 1: I take issue with saying that leaving ground beef on the counter for eight hours before you cook it is okay.

46
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,636
Speaker 1: I don't see a problem all right.

47
00:03:14,837 --> 00:03:19,153
Speaker 1: I uh we should do the ground beef challenge Mmm.

48
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:22,430
Speaker 1: I'll get some ground beef, and we'll leave it out for eight hours at room temperature.

49
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:23,868
Speaker 1: Then you can eat it, and we'll see what happens.

50
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:32,252
Speaker 0: Anyway, I ordered that we're not leaving it out for like 24.

51
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:37,289
Speaker 1: I I. so I could not be sure that the problem didn't happen the night before either.

52
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,376
Speaker 1: Hmm could not be sure it was.

53
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:42,325
Speaker 1: the top half of the fridge was warm like all.

54
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:47,145
Speaker 0: the butter was completely liquid And I'm still cooking it to the appropriate safe temperature to kill.

55
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,675
Speaker 1: fucking everything right yeah But that does not necessarily matter.

56
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:54,712
Speaker 1: a lot of the pathogens and food create poison so even if you kill the bacteria It's too late.

57
00:03:55,033 --> 00:04:00,090
Speaker 1: the food is already unsafe even if you kill all the bacteria in it, but I've set the poison on fire.

58
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't work for many things.

59
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,317
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's Thursday.

60
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:05,981
Speaker 1: It's the lounge.

61
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:06,886
Speaker 1: We can talk about anything.

62
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:07,469
Speaker 1: He's got any news.

63
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:08,636
Speaker 0: I do have a news.

64
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:09,420
Speaker 0: this news like.

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,089
Speaker 1: he didn't fight me on how it's called the lounge.

66
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:12,989
Speaker 0: You gotta give up on that.

67
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:18,115
Speaker 1: That is one of the hills I will die on oh Die.

68
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:20,363
Speaker 1: and our website even calls it the lounge.

69
00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:21,409
Speaker 0: die soon then.

70
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:22,983
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

71
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:23,649
Speaker 0: so?

72
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,574
Speaker 0: The you know people.

73
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:29,850
Speaker 0: I know most people know about the Nobel Prize, but only nerds know about the Fields Medal.

74
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:35,210
Speaker 0: The Fields Medal is basically what you is like sort of like the Nobel Prize for math only sign.

75
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:38,003
Speaker 1: I know about the Fields Medal only because of YouTube channels.

76
00:04:38,063 --> 00:04:39,269
Speaker 1: I follow that talked about it.

77
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:47,244
Speaker 0: Okay, I knew about it before then, but basically if you win the Fields Medal You're like one of the best maths people ever right.

78
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:48,670
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of people who want it.

79
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:51,269
Speaker 0: It's only given to like math geniuses.

80
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:54,019
Speaker 0: So it's a big deal if you get the Fields Medal.

81
00:04:54,822 --> 00:05:00,553
Speaker 0: and so just recently what a few days ago Just super recently yeah August 1st.

82
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:01,777
Speaker 0: so yesterday yesterday.

83
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:04,907
Speaker 0: They awarded the Fields Medal to someone.

84
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:05,429
Speaker 0: What's his name?

85
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:09,937
Speaker 1: Feels metal The most prestigious award in mathematics.

86
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,447
Speaker 1: I reckon it didn't say it is winner of god.

87
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:16,477
Speaker 1: damn it article Kocher.

88
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:18,210
Speaker 1: Burkar receives the medal okay?

89
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,210
Speaker 0: Yes, so the person won the medal and after Burkar that name sounds really familiar.

90
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:28,910
Speaker 0: Anyway, famous math genius person yeah, so I don't know what math they want it for cuz probably where over my head.

91
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:30,515
Speaker 0: So you won the medal.

92
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:35,510
Speaker 0: you know nice ceremony and everything put it in his his briefcase right?

93
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:37,454
Speaker 0: And I guess it was.

94
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:39,722
Speaker 0: you know it was a party some sort of reception or something you know.

95
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:44,970
Speaker 0: yeah, right a Few minutes later that briefcase is gone.

96
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,458
Speaker 1: Pro that is Pro.

97
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:56,470
Speaker 1: I mean I Think the only place that's a public place where I trust anything out of my own sight is actually enforcer land.

98
00:05:57,313 --> 00:06:00,022
Speaker 1: That is literally the only place that is acceptable.

99
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:03,618
Speaker 0: the point is is that that briefcase is gone So everyone starts looking for it now.

100
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,167
Speaker 0: This is like a serious.

101
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:10,441
Speaker 0: Hi someone Yeah Got into this an invite only of well clearly an inside job.

102
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:15,477
Speaker 1: someone who's jealous someone who knows what the fields fucking metal is Right and wants it right.

103
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,966
Speaker 1: I mean unless it's made out of gold or something.

104
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:18,629
Speaker 1: I've never seen it.

105
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:19,010
Speaker 0: pretty sure.

106
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,117
Speaker 0: It's a solid gold disc anyway.

107
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,060
Speaker 0: It's value.

108
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:22,662
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

109
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:23,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's worth $4,000.

110
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:23,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not.

111
00:06:25,816 --> 00:06:32,170
Speaker 1: It's pretty good Because the thing the reason you steal gold is that unlike other things that are melted the fuck down then no one knows it.

112
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:34,861
Speaker 1: There's no way to determine what it was.

113
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:39,302
Speaker 0: they can just make a new Fields Medal But they should also catch whoever stole the $4,000 lump of gold.

114
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:48,705
Speaker 0: yeah, anyway they found the briefcase tossed away and open and Not only was the Fields Medal gone as well.

115
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:51,154
Speaker 0: It was gone I don't know.

116
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:53,888
Speaker 0: puts their wallet in a briefcase and not in their pocket, but whatever.

117
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,294
Speaker 0: And yeah, there's this.

118
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:57,619
Speaker 1: there's a situation.

119
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,050
Speaker 0: I have done that for this is like a loupon situation.

120
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:11,270
Speaker 1: No, but the situation where I have basically put my wallet in like a bag or something and not had it on me at An event like this is in my job.

121
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,689
Speaker 1: I would often like be on a stage giving basically like a TED talk so and I wouldn't carry anything on me.

122
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,442
Speaker 1: So I can put it all somewhere now swimming.

123
00:07:19,623 --> 00:07:23,984
Speaker 1: It's not in a briefcase somewhere It's like in my hotel room probably in that safe.

124
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:29,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway This is awesome loupon thief story, but they're totally gonna get caught.

125
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:37,022
Speaker 1: I think they got seen on camera Yeah, but okay, so someone wearing a hat and dark clothes Yeah, I feel like it's easy to get away with the crowd.

126
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:40,810
Speaker 0: It's such a. it's such a small You know event with not too many people at it.

127
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it's gonna be really hard for these people.

128
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:45,037
Speaker 1: I feel like there's two main possibilities.

129
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:51,057
Speaker 1: possibility number one that I think is the second most likely is Inside job of someone related to the event.

130
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:55,950
Speaker 1: this number two thing that I think is the most likely is someone who works at the hotel.

131
00:07:56,891 --> 00:08:08,150
Speaker 0: Well, I think what it could be is actually someone who's real smart and was perhaps got You know in by working for the caterer or working for the hotel or dressing like that, you know or some such.

132
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:10,819
Speaker 0: So there probably wasn't mega security there.

133
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,050
Speaker 1: I imagine you trust the people at an event like this.

134
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,728
Speaker 0: It's the kind of thing where you could probably just walk in right?

135
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:23,010
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, I didn't read the details of like when and how like I didn't see the breakdown of the timeline.

136
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:26,070
Speaker 0: Like when did they last see the pretty think about like a wedding?

137
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,769
Speaker 0: It's like you can just walk in until someone says who the hell are you?

138
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,581
Speaker 1: Okay, so he what he what he got the award for or for?

139
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:37,960
Speaker 1: let's see if we understand this for his work on Categorizing different kinds of polynomial equations.

140
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,625
Speaker 0: I know what polynomial equations are.

141
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:40,990
Speaker 0: I know what categorizing is.

142
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:42,668
Speaker 1: So we're halfway there.

143
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:50,130
Speaker 1: He proved that the infinite variety of such equations can be split into a finite number of classifications.

144
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:52,234
Speaker 0: Actually make sense.

145
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:56,370
Speaker 0: Okay, so every kind of polynomial equation fits into one of some number of categories.

146
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,701
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that number of categories is finite as opposed to infinite.

147
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:01,326
Speaker 0: Well, what's what are the number of categories?

148
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:04,946
Speaker 1: It doesn't say He might not have identified all the categories.

149
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:10,826
Speaker 1: He just proved That's a finite number of categories a major breakthrough in the field of bi-rational geometry.

150
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:11,889
Speaker 1: I have no idea what that is.

151
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,615
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing that that like three blue one brown channel We'll talk about.

152
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,069
Speaker 0: I can understand why that's a big deal.

153
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:26,909
Speaker 1: This sounds like the kind of thing where I will find a YouTube video that will explain this and I'll feel like I Understand it after I watch the YouTube video.

154
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,279
Speaker 0: But you know and you won't be able to use it whatever.

155
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,009
Speaker 1: in the same way that I feel like I understand how 18th century ships work after I read a Horatio book.

156
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:44,990
Speaker 1: So in turn in another high story something was stolen that cannot just be melted down and cannot easily be fenced.

157
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:51,190
Speaker 1: Someone stole the Swedish crown jewels work work work like.

158
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:56,090
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna read the first part.

159
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:04,330
Speaker 1: Thieves stole priceless royal artifacts in a daring raid on a Swedish Cathedral.

160
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:11,530
Speaker 0: Before escaping by speedboat all the Swedish sports teams are gonna have to change the Jersey to have one crown instead of three.

161
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:17,289
Speaker 1: Or they should just put that little logo on milk back on milk cartons.

162
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:24,787
Speaker 0: But this story is crazy and I guess it's a lot harder to heist than yeah.

163
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:34,036
Speaker 1: And even if you succeed like maybe no one thought anyone would try to steal them and like maybe it was easier than you expected What are you gonna do with them?

164
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:36,064
Speaker 1: If you sell it to a supervillain?

165
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:37,530
Speaker 1: He's just going to have you killed.

166
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:40,942
Speaker 1: If you keep them you gain nothing.

167
00:10:40,962 --> 00:10:42,790
Speaker 0: great, I mean I can wear the.

168
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:47,271
Speaker 1: Yeah, to be fair if I stole the crown jewels It's me.

169
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:51,650
Speaker 0: people always think when you steal something you want to fence it to get money because money is what you actually want.

170
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,328
Speaker 0: What if what they wanted was the crown jewels a fucking sweet?

171
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:59,110
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, I feel like if I got my hands on these getting crowns even only plays you could buy a crown.

172
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:03,745
Speaker 0: I have a tiara still yeah going to go on Amazon you search for crown.

173
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:04,708
Speaker 0: You can find a real one.

174
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,952
Speaker 1: No Well, what do you mean?

175
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:09,842
Speaker 1: right real like actually made out of gold or real like?

176
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:12,170
Speaker 0: yeah an actual jewel a real jewelry crown.

177
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,530
Speaker 0: I bet even if you go over to Fifth Avenue, you couldn't find a crown.

178
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:16,637
Speaker 0: I'll bet a real crown.

179
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,864
Speaker 0: I could get a crown jewel quality crown.

180
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:20,429
Speaker 1: Maybe that's what I'll spend my square money on.

181
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:24,050
Speaker 1: But you can read the story about this thing.

182
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:32,430
Speaker 1: But yeah, if I stolen if I had these ground jewels I would tell no one But I would wear them around the house and I would ensure that I was buried in them and that would be the extent.

183
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:40,150
Speaker 0: I would just go someplace where no one to recognize what they were and Just be the the crazy dude who wears a crown all the time like the dude who would wander around.

184
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,013
Speaker 1: Magpies are not.

185
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,825
Speaker 1: make that the dude the banana maracas guy.

186
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:50,770
Speaker 1: and in a maraca my hero You could be the banana maraca equivalent except the thing you're doing is walking around the convention.

187
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:52,761
Speaker 0: I walked around a convention with the crown.

188
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,230
Speaker 0: nice cosplay bro, right?

189
00:11:54,530 --> 00:12:00,129
Speaker 0: Nobody who would know at PAX East unless they was like even if there was a Swedish person there would they fucking recognize it?

190
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,221
Speaker 0: Would they believe that it was the real one right?

191
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:05,390
Speaker 0: It's like it would just look like an awesome crown.

192
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:06,896
Speaker 0: No one would even say anything.

193
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,790
Speaker 1: Yep, right, but then again you might find that one nerd who's like.

194
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:11,452
Speaker 1: That's the.

195
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:14,683
Speaker 1: that's a really good Swedish King cosplay.

196
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:15,686
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

197
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:16,730
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

198
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:18,850
Speaker 0: No, it would be a banana maraca crown.

199
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:22,473
Speaker 1: That's what I would do.

200
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:26,890
Speaker 1: I would give them to and also I would give the crown to the banana maraca guy.

201
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,934
Speaker 0: You could also just do.

202
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:30,966
Speaker 0: I know I can just dress up as Burger King.

203
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:36,087
Speaker 1: you could probably really On your deathbed you reveal it.

204
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:43,000
Speaker 0: The one problem with this plan is that One of many problems.

205
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,427
Speaker 0: There's really only one problem with the plan Is that actual crowns are heavy as fuck and your neck is gonna hurt like a motherfucker.

206
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:56,210
Speaker 1: Uh They're actually lighter than you think because that while they are heavy because it's gold they are.

207
00:12:57,031 --> 00:13:00,714
Speaker 0: Go wear that crown for all of packs and tell me how your neck doing I don't know.

208
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:03,470
Speaker 0: I have none didn't wear crowns for eight hours.

209
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, they only wore them for specific ceremonies.

210
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:07,166
Speaker 0: They wore them for the ceremony.

211
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:07,990
Speaker 0: then they went in the back room.

212
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,914
Speaker 0: They took that shit off.

213
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:10,300
Speaker 1: I didn't look at what they actually stole.

214
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,590
Speaker 1: if they're I hope they got one of those like.

215
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:14,617
Speaker 0: They stole actual crowns.

216
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:17,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, they stole other thing because I really like those holy hand grenades.

217
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:19,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, look there's a picture of the two of them right here.

218
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,587
Speaker 1: hide your bunnies the holy hand grenades.

219
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:22,350
Speaker 0: hide your bunnies.

220
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,746
Speaker 1: They got these two maces and the crowns.

221
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:27,552
Speaker 1: mace Septers.

222
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:29,584
Speaker 1: don't mess with the scepter in Shadowgate.

223
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:30,269
Speaker 1: It's bad news.

224
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:42,201
Speaker 1: So in some weird side news This just like this weird story about cuz but it illustrates a broader point Kroger which is like this Midwestern grocery store chain.

225
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:43,786
Speaker 0: It's like only rim cares.

226
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:44,830
Speaker 0: It's a really big chain.

227
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,479
Speaker 1: But but the news is not about.

228
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,745
Speaker 1: I don't care about Kroger like.

229
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:48,489
Speaker 1: that's not the crux.

230
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:54,855
Speaker 1: They are a bunch of their stores have banned Visa credit cards.

231
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:57,383
Speaker 0: I'm surprised they're banning Visa and not Amex.

232
00:13:57,443 --> 00:13:58,045
Speaker 0: is Amex.

233
00:13:58,245 --> 00:13:59,770
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure has the biggest fees?

234
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,850
Speaker 1: Yep, but visa is used the smallest fees visas used the most by people.

235
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:07,862
Speaker 1: That's correct and visa has very high fees.

236
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:11,077
Speaker 1: Yeah, and from what I gather visas I mean they all have high fees.

237
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:12,224
Speaker 0: just Amex is even higher.

238
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:16,610
Speaker 1: Yeah So the dispute is over the high annual swipe fees.

239
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:18,819
Speaker 1: So visa charges these like annual fees.

240
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,350
Speaker 1: right and the grocery store is basically trying to ban visa.

241
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:23,278
Speaker 1: Well, they're they can like.

242
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:26,170
Speaker 1: there's no law that says they have to accept one kind of credit card.

243
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,210
Speaker 1: No, what sucks is that my entire life?

244
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:35,010
Speaker 1: I always had this policy to have at least two different types of credit cards just in case this kind of bullshit happen.

245
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,414
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have an Amex and a visa.

246
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:43,537
Speaker 1: So I had um And I had that for my like a long time.

247
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:44,401
Speaker 0: I had a MasterCard.

248
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:46,550
Speaker 0: originally it changed a visa without my input.

249
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,886
Speaker 1: Yeah my MasterCard fucking changed a visa and all my credit cards are visa.

250
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:56,410
Speaker 0: then I got a American Express and then I got another visa and I don't use the old two old ones.

251
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:57,453
Speaker 0: So I still have them.

252
00:14:57,674 --> 00:15:03,293
Speaker 1: there's a restaurant in Long Island City called turn us all and I forget this every goddamn time I eat there.

253
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:09,292
Speaker 1: they accept two forms of payments cash or Amex.

254
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:12,221
Speaker 1: hmm, they don't accept visa or MasterCard.

255
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:12,703
Speaker 1: Hmm.

256
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:14,889
Speaker 1: I forget this every goddamn time we go there.

257
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,093
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz Amex me.

258
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:22,427
Speaker 0: one of Amex's things they did and I guess still do is make like exclusive deals Especially with restaurants, which is horrible.

259
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:26,239
Speaker 1: Like I Almost want to boycott places that do stuff like that.

260
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,563
Speaker 1: Hmm on principle.

261
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:28,627
Speaker 0: See here's the thing right.

262
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:31,950
Speaker 0: on the one hand It's like man cards are super convenient.

263
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:36,370
Speaker 0: I just want to use my card or Apple pay everywhere so I don't have to carry any cash.

264
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,601
Speaker 0: Think about it and life is super easy.

265
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,490
Speaker 0: and I get points and bonuses, right?

266
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,337
Speaker 0: and of course the reason I get bonuses?

267
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:57,758
Speaker 0: because as we've said many times credit cards are Benefit the user of them because you know us yep And as long as you always pay off your your balance Which you should yeah, and they benefit the credit card company and the bank that use the credit card But they hurt the merchant.

268
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,430
Speaker 0: the credit cards suck for merchants a cost of money.

269
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:01,214
Speaker 1: But here's my.

270
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:02,219
Speaker 1: I have an actual solution.

271
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:04,410
Speaker 0: so I was but I would love to use credit cards everywhere.

272
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,725
Speaker 0: But something that's actually been happening lately is you know, obviously it's because I like this convenience.

273
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:11,590
Speaker 0: cash only is annoying, right?

274
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,189
Speaker 1: Oh, I won't go to places.

275
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:14,913
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

276
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:19,008
Speaker 0: What's even worse than cash only won't accept cash is I've run into.

277
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:24,749
Speaker 0: that is especially where I work now in Soho, there are several places that are card only.

278
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:29,570
Speaker 0: and Now you might say well, why would you be upset about card only if you love to use?

279
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:32,709
Speaker 1: Poor people marginalize people poor people kids.

280
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:39,010
Speaker 0: Not everyone in the world can even have a credit card Even if they're smart and listen to our advice and try and get a credit card.

281
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,171
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we say they should like I got a credit card at 16.

282
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,940
Speaker 1: It's a big part of why my credit so good.

283
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:45,829
Speaker 1: that is actually not easy to do.

284
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:55,929
Speaker 0: I think it should be illegal to not accept cash at all because you're basically saying yeah You can't shop here unless you are, you know, it's like even if you're.

285
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,450
Speaker 0: You're a smart person who wants a credit card and would use it everywhere and would always pay off the balance.

286
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:03,578
Speaker 0: Sometimes you just can't fucking get one.

287
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:05,003
Speaker 1: So here's to count.

288
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:08,674
Speaker 1: I'm not arguing these but these are Valid counterexamples.

289
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:12,989
Speaker 1: What if there is a place that only sells very expensive things.

290
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:16,965
Speaker 1: It is dangerous to accept cash in a place like that.

291
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:22,894
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Like say you sell like ten thousand dollar suits and twenty thousand dollar ostrich things Like.

292
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,290
Speaker 1: is it okay to not accept cash?

293
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:32,269
Speaker 0: It's okay, I guess if you also accepted things like say a money order from the post office Okay, or maybe a cashier?

294
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,594
Speaker 1: Cashier's checks are pretty much not.

295
00:17:34,795 --> 00:17:35,878
Speaker 1: they're always a scam.

296
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:39,187
Speaker 1: They're they're less secure than a regular goddamn check really.

297
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:43,649
Speaker 0: They're not a certified check It's a check the bank prints out.

298
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:48,146
Speaker 1: Yeah So that you know It's more easy to counterfeit because they're weird and people don't know how to like.

299
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:49,130
Speaker 1: people don't know about them.

300
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,636
Speaker 0: I thought they were harder to counter.

301
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:53,466
Speaker 0: no than uh, so why doesn't the bank fix that then?

302
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:54,390
Speaker 1: because they don't give a shit.

303
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,183
Speaker 1: Cuz cashier's checks are basically only used by people trying to scam them.

304
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,549
Speaker 1: Why don't we here's it?

305
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,419
Speaker 0: Why don't we scam and commit counterfeit cashier's check?

306
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:04,429
Speaker 1: the the real fancy check is the certified check.

307
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:10,614
Speaker 1: All right, a certified check means the the issuing bank Guarantees the money.

308
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:10,895
Speaker 0: All right.

309
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:14,990
Speaker 0: Well, that's the point is that you just accept something that anyone could have access to.

310
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:25,808
Speaker 0: Regardless Person suddenly gets mega-rich and finds a suitcase full of money that's not stolen and they hand it into the police.

311
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:35,070
Speaker 0: the police give it Back and it's all legal and they want to buy a crown And they go into the crown store and they're like cat the no cash accepted at the crown store.

312
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,793
Speaker 0: They should.

313
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:39,833
Speaker 0: they should have some other option because no one's gonna give that person a credit card yet Right they?

314
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:41,499
Speaker 0: because they haven't established any credit rating.

315
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,210
Speaker 0: There's still a homeless person with a pile of dollar bills, right?

316
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:47,446
Speaker 0: They should be able to go to the post office get a money order and buy the crown.

317
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:55,710
Speaker 1: So To at least we'd have to change a lot of laws because cash is only required to be accepted to pay debts.

318
00:18:55,891 --> 00:19:00,431
Speaker 1: Technically, I'm not a lawyer but that is what lawyers have said Mm-hmm.

319
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:02,860
Speaker 0: It's so I'm saying the law should be so.

320
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,770
Speaker 1: say you eat at a restaurant that didn't say they won't take cash.

321
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,770
Speaker 1: They usually have to take cash because now you owe them a debt.

322
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:10,229
Speaker 1: You can pay that debt with cash.

323
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:14,590
Speaker 1: But if you didn't get food yet, they could say we won't serve you if you're gonna pay cash.

324
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:21,108
Speaker 1: That would be okay, but they couldn't say we won't take cash after they served you the food anyway.

325
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:27,729
Speaker 1: So all that aside, I think the real answer is Credit card should be nationalized.

326
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:29,655
Speaker 1: They shouldn't be private.

327
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:31,903
Speaker 1: There shouldn't be private companies running them.

328
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:33,869
Speaker 1: They should be regulated and nationalized.

329
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:47,450
Speaker 1: Well, I think that the private company should be able to offer their own credit cards But there should be government-issued credit cards that anyone can get that Are regulated heavily and compete with the private with the party all private.

330
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,890
Speaker 0: So the problem is is two different things going on here, right?

331
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,235
Speaker 0: The first thing what's really?

332
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:54,307
Speaker 0: it's like a credit card is technically like a loan, right?

333
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:54,910
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

334
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,690
Speaker 0: It's like you're getting a loan to buy things and then paying it back.

335
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,730
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but they function the same way as a debit card.

336
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,593
Speaker 0: Well, right is they?

337
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:10,045
Speaker 0: what they should do is they should make just a nationalized free to anyone who wants one anonymous Cash cards so you can have the who.

338
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:10,990
Speaker 1: those are dangerous, too.

339
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:19,559
Speaker 1: those do not solve a lot of the problems of why we want to eliminate cash because Bearer instruments are valuable to steal.

340
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:21,626
Speaker 0: No, no, the cash isn't on the card.

341
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:22,910
Speaker 0: It's still attached to your account.

342
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:26,189
Speaker 0: It's just a. it's just a mechanism for buying things.

343
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,510
Speaker 1: There should be national nationalized credit and debit cards that are available to anyone.

344
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,241
Speaker 0: No, it's that the loan part shouldn't be nationalized.

345
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:38,219
Speaker 0: right if you want to get loans and have a line I think the loan part should also be also be nationalized.

346
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,590
Speaker 1: They might not have to issue a high limit to everyone.

347
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:44,410
Speaker 1: No, you might only get a limit of $10.

348
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,813
Speaker 0: No You should just.

349
00:20:45,873 --> 00:20:46,175
Speaker 0: just.

350
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:56,350
Speaker 0: the ability to buy things online In stores that only take cards to just the ability to conveniently buy things without carrying pieces of paper should be free to everyone.

351
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:01,550
Speaker 0: With loans and interest that doesn't need to be free to everyone.

352
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:03,710
Speaker 0: It's better off if it's not free to everyone.

353
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,658
Speaker 1: I would argue that that should be.

354
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:18,310
Speaker 0: but a three-year-old who wants to buy something from the ice-cream man Should be able to have a card not have to carry pictures of George And the ice-cream man should be able to accept should be forced to accept that card, right?

355
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:19,718
Speaker 1: But what about Bitcoin?

356
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:20,886
Speaker 1: that'll solve all these problems?

357
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:21,469
Speaker 1: Fuck your coin.

358
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:30,352
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the day.

359
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:44,419
Speaker 1: so as much as I Think a lot about UX and like UX is literally like one of my core Areas of expertise professionally like I've done it professionally for a long goddamn time and I think I'm good at it.

360
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:59,138
Speaker 1: But nowadays I rely mostly on teams of UX people and I'm kind of not allowed to do my own UX because I'm supposed to be doing this higher-order stuff, but this article that I found is Fantastic and all of you should read it.

361
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:15,780
Speaker 1: It is a very detailed explanation of the principles of using animation as part of UX in a way that adds value to the UX as opposed to just looks nice and this is Really really well put together and really really accurate.

362
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:25,539
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and it has animated examples Like remember a while ago someone did that thing that all these animated gifs showing all the ways to handle scrolling in platformers.

363
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:36,280
Speaker 1: It's like that but for basically UX animations like real-time versus not real-time and the way is to separate elements and it's really really intuitive and really well put together.

364
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:40,539
Speaker 1: This should be your Bible if you design user experiences that involve motion.

365
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:45,159
Speaker 0: So we're doing our episode today about the beach.

366
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:49,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, my thing of the day is someone very excited to go in the water.

367
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:50,360
Speaker 0: Oh, it's very appropriate.

368
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:52,892
Speaker 1: This individual is exactly excited sadly.

369
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:53,756
Speaker 0: There's a link.

370
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:54,720
Speaker 0: is a link to Facebook.

371
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:58,800
Speaker 0: I couldn't find the link anywhere else, but I also didn't put that much effort into it.

372
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:07,603
Speaker 0: So if you send us a non Facebook link to the same clip in the next hour, so we can we can replace the Facebook link.

373
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:07,944
Speaker 0: Yep.

374
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:08,868
Speaker 1: This is real good.

375
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,174
Speaker 0: It should be publicly visible.

376
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:12,906
Speaker 0: Even if you don't have a Facebook account I think is it has that like?

377
00:23:13,187 --> 00:23:14,773
Speaker 0: I think people don't realize that is like.

378
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:16,420
Speaker 0: they say oh never get a Facebook account.

379
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:16,782
Speaker 0: Well, it's like.

380
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:20,105
Speaker 0: actually even if you don't make a Facebook account There's a like.

381
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:27,729
Speaker 0: most stuff on Facebook is just publicly visible If you link to it like even like where they have live streams and stuff Like they were streaming like some sports on there.

382
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,460
Speaker 0: You just could go visit it without an account and watch so whatever.

383
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:35,509
Speaker 1: But this person is very excited in the meta moment.

384
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:43,109
Speaker 1: the new geek nights book club book that has not been updated on the website is 2001 is a space odyssey.

385
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,053
Speaker 0: is it written by?

386
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,298
Speaker 0: was Arthur C. Clarke?

387
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,019
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, is that right?

388
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:55,693
Speaker 0: So we don't know anything about Arthur C. Clarke except he was the author of that book and I assume an old white guy.

389
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:57,139
Speaker 1: so we did an odyssey.

390
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,971
Speaker 1: now We're doing a space odyssey.

391
00:23:58,992 --> 00:24:11,130
Speaker 1: Oh It gives me an idea actually for the third book pages of pain by Troy Denning that that that's that Forgotten realms adjacent planescape book.

392
00:24:11,632 --> 00:24:13,920
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go see the movie in 70 millimeter on Sunday.

393
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:16,688
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go read about Arthur C.

394
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:17,692
Speaker 0: Clarke on Wikipedia.

395
00:24:17,953 --> 00:24:19,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know that much about him.

396
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:21,070
Speaker 0: I just know all I know.

397
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:25,011
Speaker 0: he's is an old white Side-by-side dude, it's an author.

398
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,195
Speaker 0: I literally know nothing else.

399
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:34,160
Speaker 1: the next invention We're going to perform at will be the penny arcade expo even alive or not West the real one.

400
00:24:34,782 --> 00:24:37,129
Speaker 1: We're gonna be there doing the 40 tabletop games.

401
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:39,817
Speaker 1: You must play on Monday, September 3rd 10 a.m.

402
00:24:41,762 --> 00:24:42,569
Speaker 0: Seattle time.

403
00:24:42,811 --> 00:24:43,457
Speaker 1: Yeah 10 a.m.

404
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,125
Speaker 1: Ps PDT PST.

405
00:24:46,145 --> 00:24:47,489
Speaker 0: I think it'll be an old time.

406
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:53,073
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever time it is specific time, but in New York It'll be 1 o'clock p.m.

407
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:54,080
Speaker 0: On Monday.

408
00:24:54,281 --> 00:25:01,062
Speaker 1: But the thing we're doing that we've never done before is Pax is going to live stream this panel on one of their three twitch Channels.

409
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:02,349
Speaker 0: well assuming it works.

410
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,019
Speaker 0: It'll either be working by Monday It'll have like three days to figure it out.

411
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:09,053
Speaker 0: There was a time but also it's the first panel in the morning.

412
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:10,600
Speaker 0: So will they have it set up yet in time?

413
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,932
Speaker 1: I mean all I can say is there was a time when I was the deputy manager of the enforcer team that did the live Streaming and the and it was a game.

414
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,319
Speaker 1: They never messed it up.

415
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:34,980
Speaker 1: I'm assuming they will continue that tradition of quality and You will be able to watch us live on either Pax 2 or Pax 3 and I imagine what will happen is a large number Of people will have no idea who the fuck we are and we'll be commenting who the fuck are they?

416
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:43,786
Speaker 1: But to give you some perspective When I was moderating the Pax chat in the back in the day when I did this for Pax That was the those.

417
00:25:43,886 --> 00:25:46,939
Speaker 1: that was literally what everyone said about literally everyone on every panel.

418
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:53,133
Speaker 0: so So I already learned one interesting thing about Arthur C. Clarke.

419
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:54,800
Speaker 0: All right, so he's born in England.

420
00:25:55,183 --> 00:25:55,648
Speaker 0: All right.

421
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:02,520
Speaker 0: He lived there until 1956 and then he moved to Sri Lanka because he was big into scuba diving.

422
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:12,340
Speaker 0: I did not know that he discovered the ruins and assuming Wikipedia is not lying He discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient Konaswaram temple in Shrinkhoma.

423
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,492
Speaker 1: Tracy's already posting Arthur C. Clarke facts in the chat here.

424
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:22,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then he died 10 years ago Well in March of 2008 and he was 90.

425
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:23,789
Speaker 0: So if he was alive today, he'd be a hundred.

426
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:25,826
Speaker 0: All right Pretty good run.

427
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:30,732
Speaker 1: Yeah, so This how to not suck if that seems like a weird title.

428
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:38,228
Speaker 1: we this was a series We started in geek nights many many years ago like 2006 was when we were doing this.

429
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:38,650
Speaker 1: 2007 2005 maybe even yeah.

430
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,313
Speaker 1: But we did up like 2006 was like the peak of doing these.

431
00:26:43,574 --> 00:26:50,160
Speaker 1: so the idea was We wanted to have geek guys have a little mini-series like how to not suck at things was one of the series.

432
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:57,894
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna bring it back because that's an easy way to make Thursday episodes And the idea is to give our own direct advice on how to not suck it.

433
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:11,640
Speaker 1: not necessarily how to be good at something Not necessarily useful skills, but if you're going to interact with the thing we talk about We've done such episodes as how to not suck at life how to not suck at driving how to not suck at taking your turn.

434
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:13,560
Speaker 1: I don't suck at settlers of Catan.

435
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,600
Speaker 1: So we're going to talk about how to not suck at the beach as in that place with water and sand.

436
00:27:19,982 --> 00:27:25,678
Speaker 0: It's definitely beach season right now not this weekend, but next weekend I'll probably going to a beach assuming the weather cooperates.

437
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:29,530
Speaker 1: yep And as you might know if you listen to geek nights We are big fans of beaches.

438
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,435
Speaker 0: if I had so much money didn't have to work I'd probably live on a beach.

439
00:27:32,638 --> 00:27:41,943
Speaker 1: yeah But out of scope for this episode is advice on how to not suck at going to the beach When that is used in the context of quitting your job because you're rich Because the.

440
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:47,078
Speaker 1: that advice is if you have enough money to go to the beach you should go to the beach.

441
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,002
Speaker 0: Yes That's it.

442
00:27:48,223 --> 00:27:49,730
Speaker 1: That's the full advice right?

443
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,136
Speaker 0: so no you're a normal person.

444
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:53,425
Speaker 0: It's summer You don't have to go to work today.

445
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,031
Speaker 0: The weather's good right.

446
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:55,994
Speaker 0: you're going to go to the beach.

447
00:27:56,095 --> 00:28:00,069
Speaker 0: first thing you got to do How to choose the right fucking beach.

448
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,795
Speaker 1: there's different kinds of beaches.

449
00:28:01,856 --> 00:28:06,800
Speaker 1: so if you live in part We're going to mostly talk about America because that's where the most big beach experience.

450
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:09,412
Speaker 1: But we will talk about some other beaches in America.

451
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:11,220
Speaker 1: They're basically three kinds of beaches.

452
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:13,166
Speaker 1: There's well four there.

453
00:28:13,186 --> 00:28:30,050
Speaker 1: the three main ones are beach that has normal sand and is only slightly polluted beach that has Abnormal sand and or rocks and sucks and they very small number of Very nice beaches yeah that have sent normal sand right.

454
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,120
Speaker 0: so you got to make sure that a you're allowed to access the beach.

455
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:41,460
Speaker 0: There are beaches that are public, but there are also beaches that are public But like technically only open to townies for example in Fairfield, Connecticut, right?

456
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,715
Speaker 0: There's a beach on Long Island Sound and it's open to the public.

457
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:47,587
Speaker 0: you can just go there But you can't park.

458
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:51,280
Speaker 0: the only way to get there is with a car unless you live super close right because it's a suburb.

459
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:53,294
Speaker 0: The only way to get there with a car.

460
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:58,875
Speaker 0: you got to park somewhere And you can't park there unless you got a sticker from the town or some shit like that.

461
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:03,693
Speaker 0: right because they want to keep out People from other towns and people who can't afford to live in Fairfield.

462
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:11,180
Speaker 1: There's a lot of classism Around America, and there's weird weird old laws about beaches, too.

463
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,108
Speaker 0: So whenever beach you want to go to the first thing you got to do is make sure it's a beach that you have some Way to get to without.

464
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:21,128
Speaker 0: and you know sometimes they might try to charge you money Or some other bullshit.

465
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:22,375
Speaker 1: figure out if you have to pay or not.

466
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:26,088
Speaker 1: like there are beaches that are Excess, but those signs are illegal.

467
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:26,529
Speaker 0: right.

468
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,060
Speaker 0: there's beaches where there's like in California.

469
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:36,360
Speaker 0: I know that there's public beaches But you to physically get to the public beach you would have to go through the private property of a rich person.

470
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:39,172
Speaker 0: But according to the law you there is.

471
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:41,140
Speaker 0: there must be a path for people to do so.

472
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,639
Speaker 0: But the rich people block off those paths so you could get there with a boat.

473
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:47,468
Speaker 0: The rich people might try to harass you.

474
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:48,693
Speaker 0: you got to fight with them.

475
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:56,300
Speaker 1: my favorite thing is Activist hanging out on a beach that they got to buy a boat and pissing off some rich person who probably shouldn't be allowed.

476
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:03,369
Speaker 0: Or like busting open a path where they're legally supposed to be one in hopes that You know because they're willing to go and fight the rich person.

477
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,600
Speaker 1: well like even even places like Wildwood like actually I would.

478
00:30:07,282 --> 00:30:16,513
Speaker 1: In my experience North Wildwood, New Jersey for all of the problems of that area has one of the best Actually public no problems getting to it.

479
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:18,140
Speaker 1: beaches in the East Coast.

480
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:24,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you got a car It's a fantastic markings a little tough But you can just park and you can park in the town doesn't matter where you from.

481
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:26,803
Speaker 0: you could drive there from California and park there.

482
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:31,880
Speaker 1: you can park for free legally on the street close enough to walk to that Beach if the spot open.

483
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:35,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the laws they've passed.

484
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,453
Speaker 1: There's still classes laws there.

485
00:30:36,674 --> 00:30:37,817
Speaker 1: the law is there's like a $500 fine.

486
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:44,420
Speaker 1: You don't see a lot of not white people there If you change your clothes in any public bathroom.

487
00:30:45,162 --> 00:30:50,660
Speaker 1: They want you to have to live there or pay for a hotel to have a place to change into your swimsuit.

488
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:59,320
Speaker 1: Yep, like literally the only reason that law exists is to harass poor people who want to enjoy the beach But don't want to spend the night in an expensive hotel.

489
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:00,705
Speaker 0: I mean the rule.

490
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:08,439
Speaker 0: the law is that you can't change into your bathing suit in the bathroom change in your car Yeah, or wear a bathing suit in the car when you go home.

491
00:31:08,863 --> 00:31:10,600
Speaker 0: You know get in your car wrap a towel around you.

492
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:13,140
Speaker 1: I saw I've seen people do this.

493
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,206
Speaker 1: The pro move is the family brings.

494
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:23,260
Speaker 1: you have four family members stand in a square holding up a big beach towel and you take Turns everyone else changing in that temporary area.

495
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:30,560
Speaker 1: Because another things a lot of beaches do is they ban tents because people might use tents to change their clothes?

496
00:31:30,782 --> 00:31:32,960
Speaker 1: Yep, that's the primary reason they ban tents.

497
00:31:33,242 --> 00:31:35,575
Speaker 0: so you got to find a beach that you can go to.

498
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:53,244
Speaker 0: now now that you've Figured out the beaches that are in range that you can go to go online and you will find there's actually a surprising amount of real somewhat real-time information about the beach such as Water temperature how much bacteria is in the water how what the waves and the tides are gonna be Where the beach is open.

499
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:54,991
Speaker 0: are the lifeguards gonna be there?

500
00:31:55,393 --> 00:32:00,399
Speaker 0: all this info is available online For just about any beach that has enough people visiting it.

501
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:04,040
Speaker 0: Right and you got to check it out because you want to go get some warm water.

502
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,420
Speaker 0: You wanna go into frigid cold ass polar bear water, right?

503
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,698
Speaker 0: And if you don't know anything about the beach water clothes because of some bacterial growth or some shit You don't want to go there.

504
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:23,540
Speaker 1: Like if you don't know say if like it's summer, it's summer and you might just assume Oh, it's summer so I can go to the beach but water temperature changes on a different schedule from the regular seasons.

505
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,040
Speaker 1: So if you try to swim in June, the water is gonna be freezing.

506
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:29,551
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you try to swim in August, it's gonna be warm.

507
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:35,344
Speaker 1: if you try to swim in like October It'll actually still be kind of warm September.

508
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:41,848
Speaker 0: it's still kind of warm in the water a little bit but get because the specific heat of water is real high Obviously slow and cools down.

509
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:44,680
Speaker 1: obviously shift those months if you live like in Australia.

510
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, flip to the six months plus, you know, yeah on the bottom of the earth.

511
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:50,448
Speaker 1: So the fourth kind of Beach Lake.

512
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:53,340
Speaker 1: beaches are garbage unless they're on the Great Lakes.

513
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,466
Speaker 1: That's really all there is to say.

514
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:56,659
Speaker 0: Well, I mean so the thing with a lake right?

515
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:02,116
Speaker 1: Beaches they have they have an area of scum and then it really depends.

516
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:04,711
Speaker 1: There's land there's scum There's the shitty little lake.

517
00:33:04,953 --> 00:33:05,720
Speaker 0: it varies a lot.

518
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,580
Speaker 0: Actually when I was growing up the town lake was it's like it sort of just got worse over time.

519
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,086
Speaker 0: It started out kind of great cuz like.

520
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:17,503
Speaker 0: actually fresh water does not moving a whole lot, you know But it's also not.

521
00:33:17,544 --> 00:33:22,160
Speaker 0: a pool has a lot of advantages over ocean depending on what you want to do there.

522
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll smell weird.

523
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:24,158
Speaker 1: It'll be slimy.

524
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:33,896
Speaker 0: That's the thing is that when I was very young like elementary school Right the lake beach in the town had a very large area you could swim in.

525
00:33:34,157 --> 00:33:35,200
Speaker 0: it had a lifeguard there.

526
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:35,762
Speaker 0: We would.

527
00:33:35,782 --> 00:33:37,027
Speaker 0: there would be tons of people there.

528
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:38,734
Speaker 0: We'd be doing awesome shit in the sand.

529
00:33:38,774 --> 00:33:40,220
Speaker 0: Someone made like a huge sand sculpture.

530
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,900
Speaker 0: I remember one time was a big alligator.

531
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,407
Speaker 0: Yeah Right and everyone had a super blast there.

532
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:52,440
Speaker 0: and then like five six years went by by the time I was in middle school like late Middle school the the area you were allowed to swim had gotten much smaller.

533
00:33:52,942 --> 00:33:53,965
Speaker 0: No one was going there.

534
00:33:54,286 --> 00:33:57,337
Speaker 0: the lake was like covered in like a sheet of green algaes.

535
00:33:57,357 --> 00:34:04,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's like though if they had you know Whatever caused that probably some pollution in some other environmental not goodness.

536
00:34:04,822 --> 00:34:09,916
Speaker 0: Right that lake beach could have maintained its awesomeness and it didn't you know?

537
00:34:09,936 --> 00:34:12,920
Speaker 0: fresh water needs to be you know Well taken care of to be good.

538
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,620
Speaker 0: You can also do things in the fresh water like take a little rowboat out and do some fishing.

539
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:19,353
Speaker 0: You can't do it a you know, you you go to ocean.

540
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:20,900
Speaker 0: You gotta do different kind of fishing, right?

541
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,186
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get away with a little rowboat.

542
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:22,929
Speaker 1: Yep.

543
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:31,896
Speaker 0: So, you know, you got it, you know Yeah, but I have their merits the ocean and also the the lake Yeah, but ocean beaches can also be mad gross doing all that.

544
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:32,760
Speaker 1: that is true.

545
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:41,043
Speaker 1: But I guess ocean beaches and Great Lakes beaches have a primary advantage that no lake no normal baby-ass lake could ever have Waves.

546
00:34:41,224 --> 00:34:42,831
Speaker 0: well, you some people don't want to wave.

547
00:34:43,154 --> 00:34:44,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to wave.

548
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:50,000
Speaker 0: I know you want to wave, you know, but the thing is if you want surfing you gotta have gotta have way Body surfing.

549
00:34:51,062 --> 00:34:56,340
Speaker 0: If you're surfing there's like tons of apps and websites that give you super surfing information.

550
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,438
Speaker 1: There's also way more surfing beaches than you might think.

551
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,513
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah There's people who are like actually down in Rockaway like that area.

552
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,020
Speaker 0: There's like super crazy surf people.

553
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,980
Speaker 0: They'll surf any time of year if the app says it's a good surf day, even if it's super cold.

554
00:35:08,161 --> 00:35:11,820
Speaker 1: Yep, but if you don't know the body temperature stuff like look it up.

555
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:24,818
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna try to explain all the temperatures here, but as a general rule of thumb 65 degrees Fahrenheit water temperature is The minimum that most people would stay in the water for more than like a minute.

556
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:28,096
Speaker 1: Yeah 70 is where people tend to be comfortable.

557
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:36,410
Speaker 1: I I'm okay I'll take 60 though Like I'll swim in 60 But it hurts after a while because I'm skinny.

558
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:39,380
Speaker 1: my ankles hurt a lot if I swim in water like that.

559
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,132
Speaker 0: You see if I feel myself shivering I get out.

560
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:48,510
Speaker 1: Yeah any body of water Some of our friends who have a little more padding were are Shockingly capable of staying in water.

561
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,300
Speaker 1: that would kill me for a long period of time.

562
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:57,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, as I have seen them do out of pure spite I mean that just happens and even if you go in a pool, that's the heated pool or tub.

563
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:04,265
Speaker 0: It's like even if the waters, you know, if the water is less than 98.6 degrees, you're cooling off your body You're gonna.

564
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:06,540
Speaker 0: if you stay in there too long, you'll get hypothermia.

565
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,580
Speaker 1: All right, so we'll get back to the water.

566
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,612
Speaker 1: But let's talk about what you got to bring.

567
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:15,539
Speaker 1: if you're going to a beach I gotta bring a towel of some kind to lay on.

568
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,200
Speaker 1: Yep, because laying on a beach is one of the primary pleasures of a beach.

569
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,732
Speaker 0: I've actually got a. now what I've got is I've sort of upgraded.

570
00:36:21,752 --> 00:36:23,300
Speaker 0: this is not a necessary upgrade.

571
00:36:23,621 --> 00:36:25,028
Speaker 0: It's basically this giant mat.

572
00:36:25,189 --> 00:36:27,359
Speaker 0: It's it's basically like a bunch of plastic straws.

573
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:31,160
Speaker 1: The only flaw is I think I'm gonna get one made out of bamboo instead of plastic.

574
00:36:31,442 --> 00:36:39,320
Speaker 0: No, I mean, I just bought the highest rated cheapest one and it you know It totally rolls up super small it unfolds super big, but you don't lay directly on those things.

575
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:41,710
Speaker 0: No, it's not put a towel on top of that thing.

576
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not that comfortable if you lay directly on it.

577
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:53,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah You want to you don't want to lay directly on the sand because then you get scratched up and it's not so comfy and also Sand gets crazy hot in the Sun even though it's brightly color.

578
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:56,022
Speaker 1: rule number two bring Sandals.

579
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:59,336
Speaker 1: do not assume you can just walk barefoot on the beach.

580
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:01,767
Speaker 0: a lot of times Legit hurt yourself.

581
00:37:01,908 --> 00:37:04,400
Speaker 1: it can get hotter than you think something that can happen to you.

582
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:19,428
Speaker 0: A lot is like you'll get to the beach early in the morning and the sand isn't hot yet Yeah, and you walk on the sand like a nice cool sand Ah, and then you lay out you lay down you go in the water you do some stuff and then you start to walk back And now the sand is hot and you burnt.

583
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:25,640
Speaker 0: you literally could burn your feet and get blisters on your feet from the hotness Of the sand like burn yourself in a legit way, right?

584
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,746
Speaker 0: Like oh my god, I might.

585
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,395
Speaker 0: you could even burn yourself so bad.

586
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:32,894
Speaker 0: You have to go to the hospital Yep, so make sure you protect your feet somehow from burning sand.

587
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:39,260
Speaker 1: if you ever think Maybe you can get away with just wearing your shoes and you'll be careful and you won't get sand in them.

588
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,488
Speaker 1: You know get sand in them.

589
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:42,280
Speaker 0: Even if you just go near the beach you're gonna get sand.

590
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,263
Speaker 0: You're gonna get sand.

591
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:48,100
Speaker 0: you want a sand everywhere something like that where the sand can just be knocked off or some.

592
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,548
Speaker 0: You know something you can wash off.

593
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:57,580
Speaker 1: I don't think you're gonna wash off your Jordans Yeah, so in terms of the beach towel do not buy a traditional like cotton beach towel.

594
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,114
Speaker 1: The pro move is to buy a Turkish towel and regular beach towels.

595
00:38:01,134 --> 00:38:01,696
Speaker 0: good now.

596
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:02,640
Speaker 1: They're too bulky.

597
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:03,882
Speaker 0: Yeah big.

598
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:09,740
Speaker 0: the bulkiness makes it easier to dry yourself off because they can hold more water you don't and they're more comfortable to lay on.

599
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,414
Speaker 1: My other rule is towels at the beach are never for drying yourself off.

600
00:38:13,434 --> 00:38:16,165
Speaker 0: They're only for laying on They're also for drying off.

601
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:17,912
Speaker 1: Why would you ever dry yourself off?

602
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:18,695
Speaker 1: Just stand there.

603
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,060
Speaker 0: Sometimes it doesn't work.

604
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:24,740
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, if it's really if it's too cold to be at the beach also, it's not necessarily drying yourself off from the ocean.

605
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:29,776
Speaker 0: It's after you get out of the ocean You could take a little shower to wash off all the sand and then you want to dry.

606
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:36,104
Speaker 1: see, you know Yeah, I mean then you can use the thing you laid on the beach with because you can shake all the sand out then dry Yourself off with.

607
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:40,004
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's useful to have a towel for dry If you're gonna be there a long time.

608
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:42,994
Speaker 1: the beach umbrella is actually pretty key.

609
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:44,820
Speaker 1: Do not buy a cheap one.

610
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:51,245
Speaker 0: Well, I bought a cheap one and the cheap one has a hard time staying in the ground, you know But it still works.

611
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:54,560
Speaker 0: The thing is because I had a hard stain staying in the ground.

612
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:57,900
Speaker 0: I went and I bought an anchor which is actually super fan anchors.

613
00:38:58,362 --> 00:39:05,739
Speaker 0: It's a big plastic screw and then you can basically shove any umbrella in the top of it And that will keep the umbrella from flying away.

614
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,020
Speaker 0: So but if you buy a fancy umbrella, it will have a built-in super anchor like that.

615
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:17,780
Speaker 0: So, you know You just need some kind of umbrella that's actually strong enough that it won't fly away and is actually large enough and will block the sun.

616
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,531
Speaker 0: You got to position it just right.

617
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:26,680
Speaker 0: you might have to some of the umbrellas Actually can move and change the position throughout the day which is good because you're gonna stay at the beach all day.

618
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,429
Speaker 0: Why are you going if you're only going for five minutes?

619
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,745
Speaker 0: you go to the beach early the morning and you stay there as long As you possibly can.

620
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:32,890
Speaker 1: that's really those important advice.

621
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,100
Speaker 1: if you're gonna go to the beach make it a whole day thing.

622
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, you go as early as you can you stay as long as you can.

623
00:39:37,735 --> 00:39:38,580
Speaker 0: the sun's gonna move.

624
00:39:38,862 --> 00:39:40,916
Speaker 0: You got to move the umbrella to stay in the shades.

625
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:41,399
Speaker 0: You don't burn.

626
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,726
Speaker 1: It always weirded me out like especially in Wildwood.

627
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:48,300
Speaker 1: We would be leaving the beach as a lot of people were arriving at the beach.

628
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:50,567
Speaker 1: Yep, like they wasted their whole day.

629
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:54,700
Speaker 1: They're gonna spend the worst part of the day on the beach and they're missing like the good parts.

630
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, also, you got to look at the hours for the lifeguards too because you know, you don't want to drown.

631
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:01,287
Speaker 1: Yeah, so let's talk about.

632
00:40:01,307 --> 00:40:08,304
Speaker 0: even if you know how to swim and you're good at swimming It's not the greatest idea to go at least in an ocean With no lifeguard.

633
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:14,896
Speaker 1: So one thing that annoys me is that American beaches have gotten increasingly paranoid about safety And they don't let you swim out far enough anymore.

634
00:40:14,936 --> 00:40:20,574
Speaker 0: Like anywhere The lifeguards these days are jerky and will will definitely err on the side of caution.

635
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:31,144
Speaker 1: Like the same beach ten years ago I would swim way out and like it was awesome and nowadays I get even ten feet out and they're like tweet tweet Yep, bring it in Yep.

636
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:38,971
Speaker 1: So the pro move there is to go with a bunch of people and swim before the lifeguards come because you have enough people To be able to deal with a situation that might occur.

637
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:41,000
Speaker 0: Plenty of people drowned when they were with a bunch of friends.

638
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's usually because.

639
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:46,999
Speaker 1: usually that happens because some beaches are more prone to that or not.

640
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:55,120
Speaker 0: And this is again A good idea is make friends with someone who is a real lifeguard and then you won't be afraid to just go in an unlived.

641
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:01,177
Speaker 1: But two things one if you don't know how to swim do not go into the water unless there's a lifeguard.

642
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:01,698
Speaker 1: No kidding.

643
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,286
Speaker 1: Two Read about the beach.

644
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:06,433
Speaker 1: Some beaches are very prone to riptides.

645
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:08,480
Speaker 1: Some beaches are not prone to riptides.

646
00:41:08,782 --> 00:41:19,225
Speaker 1: Some beaches have dangers you might not know about like on like Submerged rocks or sandbars like you got to know this stuff or a lifeguard will just yell at you and make sure you don't engage With those situations.

647
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:22,280
Speaker 0: even if you're dainty you're willing to swim with no lifeguard.

648
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:28,503
Speaker 0: I am and I have much of my life and if there are signs that say like this is a no swimming area There's a reason.

649
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:29,748
Speaker 0: don't swim in that area.

650
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:32,057
Speaker 0: swim in the place that usually would have a lifeguard.

651
00:41:32,077 --> 00:41:32,860
Speaker 0: That's a swimming area.

652
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,720
Speaker 1: Yep, so when Scott was dumber like not that long ago.

653
00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:38,400
Speaker 1: He didn't believe in riptides.

654
00:41:38,822 --> 00:41:40,287
Speaker 0: I didn't believe that a riptide was me.

655
00:41:40,327 --> 00:41:43,338
Speaker 0: drag me someone who knows how to swim like me out into the ocean.

656
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:45,205
Speaker 0: you just swim Sideways and you escape.

657
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:47,835
Speaker 1: so riptides are dangerous.

658
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:49,120
Speaker 0: I didn't say they didn't exist.

659
00:41:49,201 --> 00:41:52,723
Speaker 0: I said they weren't gonna say they didn't exist To see.

660
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:56,678
Speaker 1: you would argue at length that there's no way a riptide on any beach could pull you out to see.

661
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,261
Speaker 0: that's what I Said.

662
00:41:57,322 --> 00:41:58,569
Speaker 0: it's not gonna pull me out to see.

663
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,220
Speaker 0: I know how to say good not that doesn't matter.

664
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,267
Speaker 0: I could swim sideways that doesn't matter.

665
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:10,595
Speaker 0: in some places if I can't if I'm trying to go towards the beat the sand and I Feel that the water is not letting me do so I'll just swim sideways until I could get to this.

666
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,740
Speaker 1: there are Depending on the conditions of certain beaches there are riptides.

667
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:20,220
Speaker 1: They'll be so wide that they will carry you out to seed to see no matter how fast you swim sideways.

668
00:42:20,544 --> 00:42:21,678
Speaker 0: Oh, then I will go to a boat.

669
00:42:23,204 --> 00:42:24,112
Speaker 1: There will not be a boat.

670
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:24,798
Speaker 1: You'll just die.

671
00:42:25,563 --> 00:42:26,729
Speaker 0: Someone will see that I'm doing.

672
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:39,232
Speaker 1: that means but it shocks me How many people swim at beaches and don't know how to deal with riptides because generally unless you're at a beach that has specific Specific problems like some beaches will have legit crazy dangerous riptides.

673
00:42:39,472 --> 00:42:41,719
Speaker 0: This is also info you can check online in advance.

674
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:47,975
Speaker 1: - yeah But if you're caught in a riptide Meaning the water is like pulling you out to sea and you can't.

675
00:42:47,995 --> 00:42:49,280
Speaker 0: you're trying to go back to land.

676
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,116
Speaker 0: But no you're going out to sea even though you're swimming towards the land.

677
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:54,951
Speaker 1: It's real simple Do not try to swim back to the beach.

678
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:56,660
Speaker 1: You will literally die if you do that, right?

679
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:06,456
Speaker 0: You basically just exhaust yourself and then you won't even be able to stay afloat and you'll drown swim Perpendicular to the beach in any direction until you feel the riptide in parallel to the beach.

680
00:43:06,536 --> 00:43:12,910
Speaker 1: Yes parallel to the beach Sideways until the the current pulling you away from the beach.

681
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,500
Speaker 1: lessons then turn toward the beach.

682
00:43:15,664 --> 00:43:19,733
Speaker 1: Yes And if you can signal for help the other thing that people because if

683
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:23,629
Speaker 0: you can just signal for help someone can like throw you The ring and you can grab and let us pull you or

684
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:27,599
Speaker 1: they'll at least keep track of where you're being pulled out to see So they can send someone to go rescue you.

685
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:38,799
Speaker 0: Coolest thing about swimming in beaches in Australia They'll give like a lifeguard of like a lifeguard with a floaty and a rope will go swim out to get you and then the life Guard on the land will hold on to the other end of the rope.

686
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:43,379
Speaker 0: The lifeguard will grab you and then the lifeguard on the land will pull the rope to pull you both back to the sea.

687
00:43:43,761 --> 00:43:58,920
Speaker 1: I've spent a lot of time swimming at Manly and Bondi beaches in Australia and the coolest thing about Australian beaches other than the fact That they're literally perfect in every possible way Good God, is that the lifeguards will let you do whatever the fuck you want.

688
00:43:59,321 --> 00:44:08,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could swim all the way out of the ocean and they'll just know like oh, yeah He's out there and they kind of keep an eye on you and then some you know fish creature comes and kills you.

689
00:44:09,341 --> 00:44:10,385
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they'll deal with it.

690
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:11,289
Speaker 1: Like they'll save you.

691
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:12,554
Speaker 1: They'll try.

692
00:44:12,574 --> 00:44:13,940
Speaker 1: Well nowadays they do these cool things.

693
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,356
Speaker 1: Well, they'll send a drone out to like drop a life preserver.

694
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:21,095
Speaker 1: Ooh Yeah, or they'll like they'll do like they will yell at you if you're doing something.

695
00:44:21,135 --> 00:44:25,880
Speaker 1: that's really really dumb But they give you way more rope than American lifeguards.

696
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:35,480
Speaker 1: well, and I really appreciate that the other thing I appreciated was that I really like waves and Like at Manly Beach that like six-foot waves were just coming in constantly.

697
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,964
Speaker 0: Yeah the kind you see like it's.

698
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:42,824
Speaker 0: it's weird because my whole life you would watch like TV or you know watch cartoons and people Surfing in cartoons.

699
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:55,240
Speaker 0: you see these waves that looked like cartoon waves like, you know Never experienced that in my life in America Except like once a big wave can go into a lot of beaches my whole life and I never saw a wave like that.

700
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,088
Speaker 0: I thought that they were made up cartoon waves.

701
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:59,056
Speaker 0: It's like no those cartoon names exist.

702
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,869
Speaker 0: Just not in Anywhere in Northeast United States.

703
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:04,020
Speaker 1: So if you don't like waves, that's fine.

704
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:16,911
Speaker 1: But if you do, I'd highly recommend even if the waves seem small to learn how to like the techniques to deal with waves because if you're swimming like you didn't like a Wave hits you and you don't ride it the right way.

705
00:45:17,394 --> 00:45:18,097
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

706
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:22,800
Speaker 1: It's just like, okay Whatever if a big wave comes you could have a mouthful of disgusting salt.

707
00:45:22,862 --> 00:45:26,100
Speaker 1: Yeah You could be slammed into the sand under the water.

708
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:35,539
Speaker 1: The wave could like knock you over and hurt you and the rules are pretty simple when the wave is coming You have to decide are you going to go under it or are you going to ride it?

709
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:38,932
Speaker 1: Any other thing you could do carries significant risk.

710
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:44,419
Speaker 0: if the wave is big and you don't know what you're doing You could jump you can go under you can let it push you.

711
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:46,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you can just go with it.

712
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,280
Speaker 0: There's a lot of things you can do, but if you are standing firm and it smacks you that's the bad news.

713
00:45:51,421 --> 00:46:02,380
Speaker 1: But also if the wave is big like for example thing I like to do when a wave comes in is to jump into it and ride it like on my chest up through the crest Pop out the top and then land on the other side of it in the water.

714
00:46:03,123 --> 00:46:12,626
Speaker 1: If you do that to a large wave and you do not have excellent form It's just gonna fucking throw you down and it'll hurt like hell Depends how deep you are out there.

715
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:16,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a sandbar maybe or it'll it'll like throw you into the top of the water.

716
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:31,760
Speaker 1: But the guaranteed way to get through any big wave no matter how big it is is as it's coming you dive You like push yourself forward Dive into it as it's cresting over you go down and ride under the bottom and come out the top behind it.

717
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,097
Speaker 0: So you learn about tides but being on the beach You don't have to learn nearly as much about tides you do.

718
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:38,087
Speaker 1: All you got to know is how.

719
00:46:38,287 --> 00:46:39,773
Speaker 1: where is the high tide line?

720
00:46:39,893 --> 00:46:50,460
Speaker 0: and put your towels and all your stuff Beyond that line right because if it's low tide when you get to the beach That means there's a lot more sand and a lot less water And so it's gonna be a lot less sand later in the day, right?

721
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,727
Speaker 0: This the water is gonna come up and they'll be.

722
00:46:52,928 --> 00:46:59,620
Speaker 0: the beach size will decrease and if you put your stuff too close to the Water that will come up and make all your stuff wet.

723
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,800
Speaker 0: So and it will come faster than you realize like it might surprise you and tides do not line up two days.

724
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:08,229
Speaker 1: No, it's not like at four change.

725
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:14,360
Speaker 0: It doesn't change just like once a day changes a few times a day Yep, so make sure you when you get to the beach just put it doesn't matter.

726
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,580
Speaker 0: You know people are like so interesting like picking a good spot at the beach.

727
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:28,400
Speaker 0: It's like no just put your shit pretty much anywhere as long as it's far enough away from the water that it won't get wet But close enough to the water that you don't have to walk super far to get to the freaking water.

728
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,208
Speaker 1: So put on sunscreen.

729
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:32,880
Speaker 1: I do not care if you think you put on sunscreen.

730
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,100
Speaker 0: I don't care if you believe sunscreen will give you cancer.

731
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,444
Speaker 0: guess what the Sun will also give.

732
00:47:36,484 --> 00:47:42,223
Speaker 1: you can't put on more sunscreen than you think you need and put it on more more times Than you think you need.

733
00:47:42,264 --> 00:47:47,690
Speaker 0: I guess the recommendation they say is like if you get in the water and get out put it back On every few hours put it back.

734
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:51,808
Speaker 0: That's like the official recommendation I actually personally have had.

735
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:58,973
Speaker 0: as long as I cover every part of my body that's exposed to the Sun With one really good fit, you know heavy application.

736
00:47:59,495 --> 00:48:00,660
Speaker 0: I've never been burned.

737
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,160
Speaker 0: I only get burned when I forget a spot or miss a spot.

738
00:48:03,522 --> 00:48:07,580
Speaker 0: But if I go to a beach if I go in the water, I'll put it on again.

739
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:11,460
Speaker 0: Also, what I'll do is to avoid having to save up money on sunscreen.

740
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:15,180
Speaker 0: When I get out of the water, I put on a shirt and get into the umbrella.

741
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,455
Speaker 1: Yep, so bring with you a shirt that blocks UV.

742
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:20,940
Speaker 1: cuz not all shirts do yep.

743
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:33,060
Speaker 1: And also bring an umbrella like we said because actually one of my favorite things to do on the beach I only do this if I got there via car or I'm staying in a place that's near the beach like overnight is the beach chair.

744
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:41,979
Speaker 1: So I'll lay in the Sun for a while But most of my day will be me sitting in the chair under the umbrella reading a book and just enjoying the ambiance of the beach.

745
00:48:43,482 --> 00:48:46,740
Speaker 1: God, that's the one thing I can't really do it Sandy Hook that I would do in Wildwood.

746
00:48:46,921 --> 00:48:50,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know food on the beach is always a thing.

747
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:57,656
Speaker 0: So a lot of beaches will have a place where you can buy food and that is the best option Even though it costs money because now you don't have to carry shit Yep.

748
00:48:57,941 --> 00:49:07,507
Speaker 0: But if you have a car or the beach is super close to your house or super convenient or whatever and the beach allows it You can get some grilling going on there.

749
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,451
Speaker 1: bring that cooler.

750
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:10,680
Speaker 0: bring a cooler full of good stuff, you know.

751
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,979
Speaker 0: It's usually easier to do when you got more people, you know, you know, just think about it.

752
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,250
Speaker 0: And yeah, you know don't do anything to dirty up the beach.

753
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:21,180
Speaker 0: If you leave any litter on the beach, you must die.

754
00:49:21,421 --> 00:49:24,237
Speaker 1: Yep, if you smoke on the beach, I hate you as a person.

755
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:24,739
Speaker 0: you must die.

756
00:49:25,842 --> 00:49:27,307
Speaker 1: Uh, don't play music.

757
00:49:27,347 --> 00:49:27,929
Speaker 1: That's annoying.

758
00:49:28,029 --> 00:49:31,340
Speaker 1: Usually some beaches that's okay, but most beaches that's not okay.

759
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,485
Speaker 0: A lot of minor stuff.

760
00:49:32,586 --> 00:49:34,917
Speaker 0: if your towel gets all sandy you want to shake it out.

761
00:49:34,977 --> 00:49:36,824
Speaker 0: Okay, good You're gonna want a sandy towel.

762
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:38,369
Speaker 0: watch the wind.

763
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,095
Speaker 0: don't blow that sand on someone else.

764
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:47,391
Speaker 0: Yeah jerk face What else you know, you play some music at the beach with your Bluetooth speaker, that's cool.

765
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:50,660
Speaker 0: playing it too loud and not just me not cool.

766
00:49:51,443 --> 00:50:00,117
Speaker 1: So the main things I like to do at the beach the things that the highest quality activities in order are throwing a frisbee Cool throwing a frisbee being having it, you know bumping to other people not cool.

767
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:03,300
Speaker 1: Yep In order of my enjoyment.

768
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:05,068
Speaker 1: So therefore this is the order of things you do.

769
00:50:05,129 --> 00:50:08,638
Speaker 1: swimming is the best thing to do at the beach because it's the most exclusive to the beach.

770
00:50:10,023 --> 00:50:22,720
Speaker 1: laying in the sand Laying on a towel enjoying the Sun Sitting and reading and making fucking sand castles if you have the skills to make a sand castle If you don't just make bad sand castles, I've made a lot of bad sand castles.

771
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,059
Speaker 0: I've only made bad sand castles.

772
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:28,980
Speaker 1: But I feel like sand castles are the thing that are most likely to cause me to get a sunburn.

773
00:50:29,381 --> 00:50:32,735
Speaker 0: I've come to the conclusion like I see, you know sand castles are one of those things.

774
00:50:32,755 --> 00:50:38,340
Speaker 0: when I see people make them It's like it looks like the sand when I see like the really fancy professional ones.

775
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:46,516
Speaker 0: Right the sand that they're using looks nothing like the sand I see on a New York That one year we made a shit ton of sand castles in a while.

776
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:47,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're shitty.

777
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:54,811
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that the people who make the best sand castles are doing it at these beaches Where the sand is different and thus easier to make a sand castle.

778
00:50:55,393 --> 00:50:56,658
Speaker 0: and the ones like we get this.

779
00:50:56,678 --> 00:51:05,771
Speaker 0: you get the sand Wet up in New Jersey or whatever and it's like it's all wet and super dark and you sculpt it or whatever But then it gets all dry and crumbles apart, right?

780
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:07,980
Speaker 0: I see people making a fancy sand castle.

781
00:51:08,241 --> 00:51:10,513
Speaker 0: They're saying looks dry like it's brightly colored.

782
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:14,815
Speaker 0: It's not dark yet It's staying together in like a really awesome shape and that's a different.

783
00:51:14,835 --> 00:51:16,304
Speaker 0: it must be a different sand At least I'm.

784
00:51:16,626 --> 00:51:21,673
Speaker 0: I believe it's different sand they've got And there must be certain beaches that are really good for sand castle.

785
00:51:21,693 --> 00:51:22,396
Speaker 0: that I haven't been to.

786
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:24,143
Speaker 1: so someone asked What about kite flying?

787
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:29,123
Speaker 1: so kite flying is banned in a lot of beaches because it is dangerous to the other people on the Beach, right?

788
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:31,280
Speaker 0: I mean if you're really good at kite flying it won't be dangerous.

789
00:51:32,761 --> 00:51:37,276
Speaker 0: There's a lot of incidents or people are really shitty at kite flying and the kite comes and swoops down.

790
00:51:37,296 --> 00:51:38,882
Speaker 0: if I can like stab Someone.

791
00:51:39,243 --> 00:51:40,186
Speaker 1: well, you saw that happens.

792
00:51:40,206 --> 00:51:44,280
Speaker 1: We just got impaled by a umbrella that got away, right?

793
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,808
Speaker 0: You can get impaled by a kite too.

794
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:50,580
Speaker 0: If you do want to fly a kite at the beach Usually that's the thing that's off season, right?

795
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:57,120
Speaker 0: Well, it's a thing you can do offseason and it's a thing you can do super early or super late when people are not.

796
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:00,700
Speaker 0: You know, the lifeguards aren't there but the beach you're allowed to go on to the sand.

797
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:02,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the time for kite flying.

798
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,323
Speaker 0: as soon as people are beaching and the lifeguards show up You got to reel that kite in.

799
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:10,074
Speaker 1: so I am also a fan of the beach sports.

800
00:52:10,596 --> 00:52:11,940
Speaker 1: Like I like to play beach volleyball.

801
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,834
Speaker 1: Unfortunately, most of our friends we would go to beaches with are not into.

802
00:52:15,854 --> 00:52:17,100
Speaker 1: we're not into that when we would go.

803
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,353
Speaker 0: So I'll say you don't need to go to a beach to play beach volleyball.

804
00:52:19,373 --> 00:52:23,393
Speaker 1: There's beach volleyball courts Yeah, but I'm not into it enough to seek it out on its own.

805
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:24,698
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing I like to.

806
00:52:24,738 --> 00:52:30,740
Speaker 1: it's like an Activity I like to add to the beach because there's a big difference because it's hard to find a beach It's got that shit pre-installed.

807
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:36,380
Speaker 1: Well more importantly nowadays when we go to the beach because we're busy we tend to go for like a day trip and that's it.

808
00:52:36,882 --> 00:52:39,532
Speaker 1: The day trip to the beach is a very different experience from the.

809
00:52:39,934 --> 00:52:41,440
Speaker 1: you are at a beach for a week.

810
00:52:42,164 --> 00:52:47,619
Speaker 1: the longer you're going to be at the beach the more Adjacent activities you bring to the beach.

811
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:52,340
Speaker 1: Like I'll read a whole book as opposed to reading my phone and then just laying there.

812
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:56,000
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot of new and interesting takes on like beach sports.

813
00:52:56,060 --> 00:53:02,259
Speaker 0: Like there's that one where there's like a. there's like basically a mini trampoline, but you don't jump on it You like trampoline you throw a thing at it.

814
00:53:02,621 --> 00:53:06,135
Speaker 0: I think we must have might have even done this as a thing of the day once like, you know these weird.

815
00:53:06,557 --> 00:53:09,384
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah You're talking about.

816
00:53:09,484 --> 00:53:17,198
Speaker 0: isn't there one where like you've got bowlers where it's like it's like two wooden balls on a rope and then There's like these sticks and you try to throw it to get it to wrap around the sticks.

817
00:53:17,318 --> 00:53:18,725
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like there's all these.

818
00:53:19,046 --> 00:53:20,954
Speaker 1: really horseshoes is a good beach thing.

819
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:24,380
Speaker 0: I like playing horseshoes at the beach Yeah, but there's lots of new and interesting different ones.

820
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,518
Speaker 0: Oh, what's the one where it's like all kinds like Viking bowling or something?

821
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:29,080
Speaker 0: What's that one?

822
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,071
Speaker 1: Oh, I saw someone talking about.

823
00:53:31,091 --> 00:53:32,460
Speaker 1: that seems really hipstery, right?

824
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,894
Speaker 0: There's basically all these like outdoor sports and some of them you can't do like.

825
00:53:35,914 --> 00:53:40,101
Speaker 0: you can't really pray croquet on the beach But some of them are beachable right, you know You can.

826
00:53:40,142 --> 00:53:43,575
Speaker 0: if you smooth out an area you can do bocce on the beach sort of yeah.

827
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:48,414
Speaker 1: Yeah, Frisbee I am a big fan of the boogie board, but I actually can't surf at all.

828
00:53:48,595 --> 00:53:49,659
Speaker 1: So I don't really can't surf.

829
00:53:51,545 --> 00:53:53,793
Speaker 0: I want to seem safer than skiing.

830
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:58,997
Speaker 1: if I ever leave America like if I'd flee Politics and go to Australia or something I feel like I'd take up surfing.

831
00:53:59,037 --> 00:54:02,760
Speaker 1: but I'm not gonna take up surfing here because I wouldn't be able to do it often enough to get good.

832
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:04,340
Speaker 0: You could do it often enough people.

833
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:04,963
Speaker 0: I know that.

834
00:54:05,003 --> 00:54:13,080
Speaker 1: I know that I wouldn't because I'd have to like go to the beach every day Like I have to skate like they're beaching and going in the freezing cold and they they want to serve so bad.

835
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:13,679
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

836
00:54:14,107 --> 00:54:21,765
Speaker 1: but like Sky already have enough sports where I have to like make it a central part of the season like skiing and biking like they're a Central part of my season.

837
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:24,419
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna add another sport that requires that level of effort.

838
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:27,330
Speaker 1: But boogie boards is a low barrier to entry.

839
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:33,960
Speaker 1: like it does not take long to learn how to use a boogie board or body Surf, so that's the thing I do in the water and that's the main reason why I want waves.

840
00:54:39,992 --> 00:54:42,530
