1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,488
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, October 2nd, 2012.

2
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:13,013
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:13,796
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:15,100
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,297
Speaker 1: We're back, and it's time to talk about Faster Than Light.

6
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,669
Speaker 1: AKA my favorite new game.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,388
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,298
Speaker 0: Okay, so I realize you have this problem here.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,610
Speaker 0: How many opening bits you think we have now, not having done a show in weeks?

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,176
Speaker 0: Ten billion opening bits.

11
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:38,948
Speaker 1: So let's assume that my entire trip to India is only one.

12
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:43,644
Speaker 0: I mean, and I was here not doing Geek Nights for a couple weeks.

13
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:45,230
Speaker 0: How many opening bits you think I piled up?

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,577
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I was also after PAX.

15
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:51,330
Speaker 1: Remember, I came back and I had that week where you were still off doing stuff.

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I realized you had this problem.

17
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,530
Speaker 0: I started off just before the show started.

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,299
Speaker 0: I told Rim we gotta ration the opening bits.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,625
Speaker 0: Hold on to them so we can dole them out slowly over the course of the next bunch of episodes, but there is a flaw.

20
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:07,150
Speaker 0: This has happened before.

21
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:10,781
Speaker 0: We have had gluts of opening bits.

22
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,485
Speaker 0: You know what happens?

23
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:19,869
Speaker 0: We go into a show, we use probably the best of the opening bits that we could remember at the time, and then we immediately forget every other opening bit that's been piled up.

24
00:01:20,912 --> 00:01:26,270
Speaker 0: When it's time for the next show, the only things that can come to mind are things that have happened since the last show.

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,844
Speaker 1: Sometimes I realize we're like that fish in Finding Nemo.

26
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:31,434
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just... It's gone.

27
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:32,258
Speaker 0: It's gone.

28
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,814
Speaker 1: I mean, you know how many times we'll be at work and I'll be like, "Scott, let's do the show tonight on

29
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:35,854
Speaker 1: X.".

30
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:37,843
Speaker 0: But there's always one thing we can remember.

31
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:39,049
Speaker 1: We'll do the show tonight on X.

32
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,213
Speaker 0: For 1957 or '58.

33
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:43,504
Speaker 1: Because a man's got to remember.

34
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:47,194
Speaker 0: I remember something about six Geodudes.

35
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:50,550
Speaker 1: It was in fact most memorable, but you cannot live ten memories.

36
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:52,736
Speaker 0: And that's it.

37
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:54,610
Speaker 0: In Sydney?

38
00:01:57,915 --> 00:01:58,559
Speaker 1: It is a Tuesday show.

39
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,010
Speaker 0: It's actually not Sydney, it's in Melbourne.

40
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:00,711
Speaker 1: I know.

41
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:02,178
Speaker 1: Well, it's funny.

42
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:08,741
Speaker 1: I saw a lot of people who don't live in Melbourne trying to argue that that was in fact a red herring.

43
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:10,930
Speaker 1: That it was mere speculations.

44
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,562
Speaker 0: Okay.

45
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,110
Speaker 0: I remember how you're talking about how Munich was like the bad place in Germany.

46
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, except, well, other people said that.

47
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,004
Speaker 0: Have you seen all of the videos and photos that were posted of Oktoberfest?

48
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:24,610
Speaker 0: People just like lying all over the place?

49
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:26,289
Speaker 0: Vomiting all over themselves in Munich?

50
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,574
Speaker 1: Or Muncken?

51
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:28,260
Speaker 1: Muncken?

52
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,270
Speaker 0: Whatever you want to call it.

53
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,171
Speaker 0: Whatever.

54
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:33,730
Speaker 1: There is a Munich-themed beer house now in Manhattan, in midtown.

55
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,374
Speaker 0: Interesting.

56
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:36,030
Speaker 1: So it's a Munich-style beer garden.

57
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,910
Speaker 0: Is it for real or is it just they say that on the, you know.

58
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,312
Speaker 0: I don't know.

59
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:45,200
Speaker 0: I mean, because like right next door there's a Chinese restaurant that says it's Szechuan style, right?

60
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,688
Speaker 0: Right on the side, Szechuan style.

61
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,110
Speaker 1: So how many aspects does that Kung Po chicken have?

62
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,656
Speaker 0: Negative 10 aspects.

63
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:58,179
Speaker 0: They would need to add 10 aspects before you could even detect that it was aspectless.

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,390
Speaker 1: But he's named after a famous general.

65
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,788
Speaker 0: Famous general did not eat that.

66
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:05,090
Speaker 0: Okay.

67
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,617
Speaker 1: Also, I want my last.

68
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:13,527
Speaker 1: So I would like to point out if we're talking about beginning, now that we're back from our long hiatus, I hope you guys still remember we exist.

69
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:17,079
Speaker 1: But we put out the call for guest episodes.

70
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:19,369
Speaker 1: We got one really good episode that we put up.

71
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:24,430
Speaker 1: And now that we're both back, we have like four more guest episodes on the way.

72
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,025
Speaker 1: So we'll use them because there's more travel coming up.

73
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:30,331
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to Moscow.

74
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:32,015
Speaker 1: now is where I'm being aimed.

75
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,700
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

76
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,998
Speaker 1: So before we get to FTL, I do.

77
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:42,126
Speaker 1: I want to talk about a game that I played.

78
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:42,528
Speaker 1: I beat.

79
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:49,310
Speaker 1: I'm done with and it is so cheap that everyone should play it because whatever, it's a few dollars.

80
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:50,895
Speaker 1: Oregon Trail.

81
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, we saw we saw this in the Kickstarter room at PAX.

82
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,970
Speaker 1: I saw it and I was like, Oregon Trail, is that just a zombie themed Oregon Trail?

83
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,861
Speaker 0: And the answer is yes, that is exactly what it is.

84
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:07,719
Speaker 1: Now, this is actually Oregon Trail director's cut, which is different.

85
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,268
Speaker 1: Oregon Trail was originally from what I read.

86
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:11,994
Speaker 1: I've never played it or three web game.

87
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:17,029
Speaker 1: I played it and it was just a like note for note homage to Oregon Trail.

88
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:24,550
Speaker 1: Oregon Trail, while it is like Hammond, Oregon Trail is also like the heart or the liver.

89
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,621
Speaker 1: We should do perhaps the brain.

90
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,767
Speaker 0: We should make Oregon Trail.

91
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:32,303
Speaker 0: It's about Oregon's and the musical instrument and not the body part.

92
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:38,149
Speaker 1: So is the opening just a like eight bit representation of that opening scene and punch drunk love with a Hammond organ?

93
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,339
Speaker 0: No, it's the whole track, right?

94
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,670
Speaker 0: The whole path is from one side of the organ to the other.

95
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,990
Speaker 0: And the guy walks all the way across and then he walks all the way back to top row.

96
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:47,136
Speaker 0: That would sound horrible.

97
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:49,770
Speaker 0: Then he walks all the way back on all the knob parts.

98
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:56,091
Speaker 1: So Oregon Trail and then the mini game is all on the pedals down on the floor is I was never good at that.

99
00:04:56,111 --> 00:05:01,307
Speaker 1: Many game is not just an homage, but it is a good game in its own right.

100
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,595
Speaker 1: It actually adds as many games.

101
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:05,482
Speaker 1: It has fun little Easter eggs.

102
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:10,199
Speaker 1: I think I've had a few dollars for it and I'm not going to play it on hard.

103
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:12,249
Speaker 1: I'm not going to try to get a high score.

104
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:21,788
Speaker 1: In fact, I think the scoring mechanism is pretty broken because I got a higher score one time when I died halfway there than I did when I made it to the end with like three family members alive.

105
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:22,270
Speaker 0: Yeah.

106
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,335
Speaker 1: But it's super fun.

107
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:36,714
Speaker 1: And the main reason it gets points, the main reason I like it is that if someone gets bit by a zombie and you want to put them down, you're like, I got to put rim down or I got to put Rainbow Dash down.

108
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:39,884
Speaker 1: I did have to put Rainbow Dash down once.

109
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:41,911
Speaker 1: Chase made it to the end with me.

110
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:47,193
Speaker 1: In fact, Chase and Emily were the only people who made it to Oregon with me in the time I actually beat the game.

111
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:52,773
Speaker 1: You fucking got a broken arm and died before I even got like three checkpoints in.

112
00:05:53,937 --> 00:06:02,684
Speaker 1: But anyway, is that if you put someone down, you want to kill him before they turn into a zombie, it makes you actually play a mini game of shooting them in the head.

113
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:05,914
Speaker 1: And you have to use a bullet.

114
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:08,885
Speaker 1: If you're out of bullets, you can't put them down.

115
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:09,346
Speaker 0: Yep.

116
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:10,410
Speaker 0: Better get some.

117
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,703
Speaker 1: The game's beginning sort of conceit is pretty great to this dude.

118
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:16,047
Speaker 1: Clements kind of.

119
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:16,730
Speaker 0: he's in DC.

120
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,271
Speaker 0: Yeah.

121
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,616
Speaker 1: And he teaches you how to play the game.

122
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:24,219
Speaker 1: And basically he gets a broken arm, gets disinterrogates bitten by a zombie, tells you how to play.

123
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,887
Speaker 1: And then you have to put him down.

124
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:27,654
Speaker 1: He's basically shown you the entire game.

125
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:31,067
Speaker 1: I don't know what else I can say without spoiling it.

126
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,130
Speaker 1: You should buy this game.

127
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:33,938
Speaker 0: You're going to spoil Oregon.

128
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,103
Speaker 0: There are things.

129
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:36,870
Speaker 0: you travel across the country.

130
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,695
Speaker 0: Everyone's zombies now.

131
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:46,813
Speaker 1: So there's a bunch of kind of interesting little like texty Easter egg things to discover.

132
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,159
Speaker 1: And some of them are pretty meta.

133
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:55,349
Speaker 1: Like at one point it'll stop every now and then and say like, there's something interesting happening outside of your car.

134
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:56,593
Speaker 1: Do you want to go check it out?

135
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:58,739
Speaker 1: And they're all different.

136
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:02,350
Speaker 1: Like one of them just says Northwest South or East.

137
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,600
Speaker 1: And you just pick and then stuff happens.

138
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,085
Speaker 0: Northwest Southwest.

139
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:10,453
Speaker 1: So I did Northwest Southwest and I found a thing.

140
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:12,278
Speaker 0: Yeah.

141
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:15,909
Speaker 1: But I don't want to spoil all those little bits.

142
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:20,226
Speaker 1: I'm not going to review it any further other than you should buy this game for your smartphone.

143
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,499
Speaker 1: You should play it on normal difficulty until you beat it.

144
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:26,251
Speaker 1: And once you've beaten it, there's no reason to ever play it again.

145
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:31,208
Speaker 1: Also, don't bother with that cloud swarm, a high score tracker, whatever.

146
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:32,172
Speaker 1: There's no point.

147
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:32,613
Speaker 0: All right.

148
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,327
Speaker 0: So I played a different phone game other than Super Hexagon.

149
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:38,694
Speaker 1: Oh, my God, I can't play Super Hexagon.

150
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,442
Speaker 0: And that game was ten million.

151
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,570
Speaker 0: Ten million is basically bejeweled.

152
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:48,563
Speaker 0: You get you know, you swipe to get three things in a row.

153
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:48,804
Speaker 0: Right.

154
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:53,788
Speaker 0: But it's slightly different because in Bejeweled, you can swap any two gems that are adjacent orthogonally.

155
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:54,050
Speaker 0: Right.

156
00:07:54,591 --> 00:08:01,513
Speaker 0: In this what you ten million, what you can do is you can take any row or column and slide it infinitely.

157
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:04,666
Speaker 0: And it wraps around like Pac-Man, either a top bottom or left right.

158
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,273
Speaker 0: And then you let go.

159
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:11,656
Speaker 0: when there's any three things that are lit up in, you know, vertically or horizontally or more than three, you can get five.

160
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:12,459
Speaker 1: So I have to let go.

161
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,866
Speaker 1: I can't just be like.

162
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:14,268
Speaker 0: Right.

163
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:20,636
Speaker 0: So basically, what you do is you pick a column or row and you you spin it all the way around with your finger until something lights up and then you let go.

164
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:23,426
Speaker 0: Now, here's the thing.

165
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:29,807
Speaker 0: The things that you can match are swords, magic wands, shields, rocks, wood and treasure chests.

166
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:31,915
Speaker 0: Those are the the symbols that you can match.

167
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:32,337
Speaker 0: Right.

168
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:39,390
Speaker 0: And what happens is while you're playing this Bejeweled at the top of the screen, this little man is running to the right and he bumps into something.

169
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,413
Speaker 0: Oh, keys.

170
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:40,933
Speaker 0: There's another one.

171
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,318
Speaker 0: Keys, keys.

172
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:45,207
Speaker 0: Let's say he bumps into a monster.

173
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:45,729
Speaker 0: Right.

174
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:52,076
Speaker 0: Well, you want to match swords and match magic wands and he'll start hurting that monster with swords and magic wand damage.

175
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,587
Speaker 0: And if the monster dies, then he'll start running again.

176
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:59,390
Speaker 0: Now, when he takes damage, he moves to the left and when he succeeds, he moves more to the right.

177
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:00,032
Speaker 0: All right.

178
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:00,314
Speaker 0: Right.

179
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:06,830
Speaker 0: So you if he goes all the way to the right of the extreme right, you actually sort of like get a bonus and he snaps back to the normal position.

180
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:11,470
Speaker 0: If he goes all the way to the left, you die and you go back to the beginning and you can play again.

181
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:20,701
Speaker 0: And all the stone and wood and gold you get, you use to upgrade your damage and magic power and armor and your shield shields to write your shields.

182
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,350
Speaker 1: Fanatical devotion to the Pope.

183
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:23,851
Speaker 0: That's right.

184
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:32,466
Speaker 0: Use it to upgrade all your shit like an RPG so that when and then you go back in the dungeon, you play more Bejeweled and to get more stuff.

185
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:34,213
Speaker 0: And then you level up your guy and you keep doing this.

186
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:37,026
Speaker 0: And the idea is that you keep playing until you get over.

187
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:41,306
Speaker 0: You cross the 10 million threshold and then you escape the dungeon and you win.

188
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:42,894
Speaker 0: But then you can keep playing on free mode.

189
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:43,014
Speaker 0: Right.

190
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:43,838
Speaker 1: But you do win.

191
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,802
Speaker 0: You do win.

192
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:46,851
Speaker 0: And you see some credits roll that are cute.

193
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:47,353
Speaker 1: All right.

194
00:09:47,614 --> 00:09:54,781
Speaker 0: Uh, the thing is, is since it's just Bejeweled, it's like while I'm playing it, I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:57,793
Speaker 0: And when you do treasure chest, you're like, got to match keys, got to match keys.

196
00:09:57,854 --> 00:09:59,381
Speaker 0: And you match some keys to unlock the treasure chest.

197
00:09:59,421 --> 00:09:59,582
Speaker 0: Right.

198
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,602
Speaker 0: And if you match keys while you're like fighting a monster, it doesn't do shit.

199
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:04,868
Speaker 0: That does nothing.

200
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:07,823
Speaker 1: It's like, when you, so when you stop playing it, you just feel dirty.

201
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:08,225
Speaker 1: No.

202
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:14,495
Speaker 0: When you, when I, when I got, when I basically what happened is it got to like 6 million and then I picked it up when I woke up in the morning, I'm like, I'll play around.

203
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:18,494
Speaker 0: And it was the mega round because I had almost upgraded everything all the way.

204
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:24,134
Speaker 0: So I was just like, boom, boom, boom, blowing everything up, match, match, match, match, like crazy.

205
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:24,395
Speaker 0: Right.

206
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:28,310
Speaker 0: And I got like four, four plus million points in the one round.

207
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:31,624
Speaker 0: And I played like many, many rounds to get up to this point.

208
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,155
Speaker 0: And then in one round I got more than halfway through and I just beat it.

209
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:35,400
Speaker 0: I sold the credits.

210
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:40,061
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh, and then I was like, well, there's no reason to, I went to play the free mode.

211
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:43,032
Speaker 0: And now I'm like, oh, I'm just matching things for no reason.

212
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:47,163
Speaker 0: Now that is not reason.

213
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:52,663
Speaker 0: I mean, you can, if you want uninstall and reinstall the games to reset it because there's no reset button on purpose.

214
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:54,793
Speaker 0: But I'm like, why would I want to do that?

215
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:56,380
Speaker 0: And just like, I've just deleted it.

216
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:56,843
Speaker 0: And that's it.

217
00:10:57,305 --> 00:11:03,289
Speaker 1: You know, it's funny you bring that up because I, while I was in India, one thing I did is I read a book now at PAX dev.

218
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:08,012
Speaker 1: I was introduced to this book and the people who introduced it and talked about it said very good things about it.

219
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,440
Speaker 1: It is called characteristics of games.

220
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:14,535
Speaker 1: And this is a book that is written by a number of people.

221
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:16,807
Speaker 1: But the one that you probably all know is Richard Garfield.

222
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:20,902
Speaker 0: That's the guy who made magic, the gathering, also known as money, the wasting.

223
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:28,230
Speaker 1: And one, I know this book is legit because he references in the book specifically, for example, who are the other people that wrote it?

224
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,136
Speaker 0: Like how much was his contribution?

225
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,022
Speaker 1: Freshly opened booster pack.

226
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:33,286
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

227
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:40,412
Speaker 1: George Scott Elias, K. Robert Guschera, Peter Whitley was the illustrator and Eric Zimmerman wrote the forward.

228
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:40,894
Speaker 0: Okay.

229
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:43,506
Speaker 0: So there were pretty much three authors, right?

230
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:45,575
Speaker 0: So does it actually tell you which parts are written by which guy?

231
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:48,204
Speaker 1: It was a collaborative work, but here's the deal.

232
00:11:48,224 --> 00:12:04,372
Speaker 1: So I read this book and I realized that what Richard Garfield and these people have done is taken everything that matters on the core level for game design and given us a lexicon to discuss those topics.

233
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:07,542
Speaker 1: So I'm not saying I'm smarter than Richard Garfield.

234
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:16,389
Speaker 1: I'm clearly not, but for now on, anytime you ever disagree with me on a point about like game design, read this book first.

235
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,222
Speaker 1: The book agrees with me and then argue with the book.

236
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:20,769
Speaker 1: And if you defeat the book, then we'll talk.

237
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:25,550
Speaker 1: I hereby defer to this book for pretty much everything I think when it comes to games.

238
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:25,971
Speaker 0: Yeah.

239
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:26,774
Speaker 0: It's kind of weird.

240
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:30,569
Speaker 0: Like, you know, you sort of discover something on your own.

241
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:33,102
Speaker 0: Like maybe you're one of those people who lives in the woods all alone.

242
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:36,278
Speaker 0: You never went to school and you sort of discovered calculus on your own.

243
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,398
Speaker 0: And then you start reading like a book on calculus and you're like, whoa, a derivative.

244
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:41,423
Speaker 0: That's what they call it.

245
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:42,467
Speaker 0: But I know what that is.

246
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,331
Speaker 0: That's the summer flash.

247
00:12:43,352 --> 00:12:44,559
Speaker 1: For example, Scott, here's the difference.

248
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,972
Speaker 1: What he refers to now, this is a term I'd heard before.

249
00:12:47,454 --> 00:12:50,284
Speaker 1: People have referenced it in game theory, the chip taking game.

250
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:51,710
Speaker 1: You know what we call that?

251
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,135
Speaker 1: The vote who wins game.

252
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,866
Speaker 1: Now I have homework for all of you out there.

253
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:57,131
Speaker 0: Boy, isn't the chip taking game?

254
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:57,632
Speaker 0: No, thanks.

255
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,259
Speaker 1: Uh, not quite.

256
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,042
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

257
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:04,164
Speaker 1: This book is great.

258
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:11,123
Speaker 1: If you design games, play games, care about games, you should read this book.

259
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:13,149
Speaker 1: It is a, it's an introduction.

260
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,940
Speaker 1: There are two ways to learn the things that are inside of this book.

261
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:27,253
Speaker 1: One read the entire book cover to cover or to play German board games for 10 years, PC games for 20 years, console games for 20 something years.

262
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:28,778
Speaker 0: Do what we did.

263
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:29,741
Speaker 1: Yeah.

264
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:32,350
Speaker 1: One of these two things, you'll get to the same conclusion.

265
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:32,830
Speaker 0: Right?

266
00:13:33,373 --> 00:13:39,514
Speaker 1: So I have homework for all of you because there is something in this book that will matter to more to Scott than anyone else.

267
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:54,427
Speaker 1: If you can explain to me and Scott, why in vote who wins games, also known as the chip taking game, also known as political games, how come whenever there's a game where basically all the players do things, but it doesn't matter.

268
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:54,768
Speaker 1: Really.

269
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:58,683
Speaker 1: There's a voting who to attack and really they're just voting who wins.

270
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:00,550
Speaker 1: How come room always wins?

271
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,682
Speaker 0: And I say to the people, look, everybody, this is a vote who wins game.

272
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,293
Speaker 0: Cast your vote for yourself and also for me.

273
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:13,995
Speaker 0: But at least if you're not going to vote for me, at least do not vote for a vote for anyone but rim.

274
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:18,478
Speaker 0: And I tell this, I can recognize when we're playing this kind of game, for example, the zombie mall game.

275
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,745
Speaker 1: Oh, the zombie mall game.

276
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:20,248
Speaker 0: And I'll wreck it.

277
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:22,015
Speaker 0: I'll say, guys is voted wins game.

278
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,841
Speaker 0: Nobody vote for him.

279
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:26,069
Speaker 0: And I say this like explicitly yet.

280
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:27,253
Speaker 0: What do people end up doing?

281
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:28,477
Speaker 0: They vote for him.

282
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:29,741
Speaker 0: Do they not know how to vote?

283
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:30,644
Speaker 0: Like hanging Chad?

284
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,752
Speaker 1: What's going on?

285
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:35,846
Speaker 1: I remember a distinct time and Wildwood where you weren't playing.

286
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:38,137
Speaker 1: You were sitting on the couch, like playing Pokemon or something.

287
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,021
Speaker 1: We were playing.

288
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:41,211
Speaker 1: A bunch of us were playing the game every round.

289
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:42,934
Speaker 1: You yelled rims winning.

290
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:43,815
Speaker 1: Fuck him.

291
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:44,997
Speaker 1: He's going to win.

292
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,059
Speaker 1: You're voting for him.

293
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,122
Speaker 1: You weren't looking at the game.

294
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:47,704
Speaker 1: And then I won.

295
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:52,700
Speaker 1: So the thing is, the people Scott tells this to don't disagree.

296
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:54,263
Speaker 1: They wreck it.

297
00:14:54,303 --> 00:14:55,046
Speaker 1: They recognize.

298
00:14:55,086 --> 00:15:00,384
Speaker 1: They know that even if Scott is trying to act in his own self-interest, they know that.

299
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:04,460
Speaker 1: it is true from personal experience that I win these games pretty much all the time.

300
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:06,085
Speaker 0: So do they not know how to vote?

301
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:06,788
Speaker 0: Is that what it says?

302
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:15,419
Speaker 1: If you read this book, your homework is to tell us why I win these games, because it actually says straight up why I win these games.

303
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,347
Speaker 0: Well, you had that book around here somewhere, right?

304
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:17,870
Speaker 0: I do.

305
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,794
Speaker 0: So let me check it out.

306
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:19,960
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I'll just give it to you.

307
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:24,009
Speaker 1: Seriously though, I cannot express to you how useful.

308
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,974
Speaker 0: How long is it?

309
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,137
Speaker 1: A week of reading.

310
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:29,081
Speaker 1: A deep, careful reading.

311
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:30,883
Speaker 0: Let's move along.

312
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:31,424
Speaker 0: Okay.

313
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:40,275
Speaker 1: So anyway, things of the day.

314
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:49,486
Speaker 1: Much like how when ponies were big, we did a lot of pony things the day, but now we backed away because, you know, people know you can find all those things on your own.

315
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:55,689
Speaker 1: And long time ago I did a series of things of the day that were related to Hitler and or being born to be alive.

316
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:59,459
Speaker 0: So send your Nazi complaints to.

317
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:00,983
Speaker 1: the new thing.

318
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:04,251
Speaker 1: Of course, is Gangnam style.

319
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:06,657
Speaker 0: How come you can't say it properly?

320
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:13,942
Speaker 1: I can't make everything of the day just be a mashup of it because that there'd be too many things like ponies.

321
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:14,585
Speaker 1: There's a thousand.

322
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:15,509
Speaker 0: I want to do a thing.

323
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:17,920
Speaker 0: How can no one can pronounce Gangnam properly?

324
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,546
Speaker 1: People have no bungas.

325
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:22,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're basically, it's like, you know how it's pronounced.

326
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,331
Speaker 0: Somebody just said it and you're like Gangnam.

327
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,777
Speaker 0: It's like, no, there's another N in there.

328
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:27,400
Speaker 0: It's Gangnam.

329
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:36,920
Speaker 1: I think what it is is that even if you know how it's pronounced, if everyone else around you is pronouncing it wrong, you will start to reflect the way they say it even if you know better.

330
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,946
Speaker 0: Subconscious doesn't happen to me.

331
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:47,220
Speaker 0: I listen to someone say something and then I say what they said and then, but it's like people like be talking to someone who says the thing properly.

332
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,926
Speaker 1: So Scott, I'm just going to warn you.

333
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:55,654
Speaker 1: It is highly likely if I go back through the geek nights archives that you say Gangnam style more often than Gangnam.

334
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,983
Speaker 0: No, maybe you're just hearing it improperly.

335
00:16:58,064 --> 00:16:59,329
Speaker 1: I'm just, you want to bet?

336
00:16:59,750 --> 00:16:59,951
Speaker 0: Yeah.

337
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:03,023
Speaker 1: You want to bet that you've never said Gangnam style on geek nights?

338
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:03,604
Speaker 0: I have not.

339
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:04,828
Speaker 1: How much do you want to bet?

340
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:06,512
Speaker 0: A lot.

341
00:17:06,914 --> 00:17:07,696
Speaker 1: How much money?

342
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:09,743
Speaker 0: I don't think I've said it that often.

343
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,011
Speaker 0: When have we said it on the show?

344
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,441
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I might have secret knowledge.

345
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:21,623
Speaker 1: So I'm just going instead of giving you every mashup with it because it would be the pony situation.

346
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:27,278
Speaker 1: This one had me laughing out loud and is also related to Hitler.

347
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:27,920
Speaker 0: Great.

348
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:30,623
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny.

349
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,416
Speaker 0: Okay, so October 2012, what month is October 2012?

350
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:40,597
Speaker 0: Well, it is many months, but most importantly, it is the month of the flexagon.

351
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:42,705
Speaker 0: Now, you might be saying, what the fuck is a flexagon?

352
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,502
Speaker 0: Here's a handy YouTube video that will show you what a flexagon is.

353
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:49,616
Speaker 1: That's the same girl who did snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake.

354
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,420
Speaker 0: That's exactly right.

355
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,691
Speaker 0: The same person she, which is a thing of the day.

356
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:55,182
Speaker 0: Many, many, many, many moons ago, I think in Beacon Times.

357
00:17:55,303 --> 00:17:55,865
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

358
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:56,226
Speaker 1: Yeah.

359
00:17:56,568 --> 00:18:01,987
Speaker 1: She has done many similar videos that are basically this mix of mathematics and adorableness.

360
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:02,589
Speaker 0: Right.

361
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:05,819
Speaker 0: So watch this video about flexagons.

362
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:06,260
Speaker 0: Yay.

363
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,110
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, we're back from Pax Prime.

364
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:11,495
Speaker 1: We're back from Pax Dev.

365
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,589
Speaker 1: We didn't even talk about it in the news, but Pax Australia was announced.

366
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,568
Speaker 0: I can't even remember the last episode we did, what we talked about.

367
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:24,385
Speaker 1: And there's a good chance we'll go because it doesn't directly overlap with Kineticon.

368
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:26,335
Speaker 1: It's the week after Kineticon.

369
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,541
Speaker 1: So here's what we're going to have to do.

370
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:30,635
Speaker 1: Go to Kineticon, run the panels department as always.

371
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:38,124
Speaker 0: Do you want to go to Australia immediately after Kineticon or do you want to go to, you know, to the Pax Australia and then stay in Australia after?

372
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:43,300
Speaker 1: If I go to Australia, I am definitely staying there for a while.

373
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:43,701
Speaker 0: Right.

374
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:44,223
Speaker 0: But are we good?

375
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:50,744
Speaker 0: We could go immediately after Kineticon and then stay there until the Pax and then leave.

376
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:53,112
Speaker 0: Or we could go there, get there.

377
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,260
Speaker 1: You act like these are mutually exclusive.

378
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,912
Speaker 1: If I go to Australia, I'm staying there at least two weeks.

379
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:00,404
Speaker 0: Are you going to say the before and after the Pax?

380
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:04,280
Speaker 1: No, I'm probably going to go there with just enough time to be ready to do Pax.

381
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:04,801
Speaker 0: Yeah.

382
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,672
Speaker 0: See, that's a you're using option number one.

383
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,864
Speaker 1: But then I'm going to stick around for like two or three weeks.

384
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:09,326
Speaker 0: Yeah.

385
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:10,753
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, where do we go?

386
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:13,465
Speaker 0: Because we could leave immediately after Kineticon.

387
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:15,976
Speaker 1: I'm going to leave like a day or two after Kineticon.

388
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:17,503
Speaker 1: But I need to, like, get my shit together.

389
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:19,190
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, you know, do we?

390
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,142
Speaker 0: you know, the timing of the leaving was all the question was about.

391
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,090
Speaker 1: I mean, if Pax starts what, Friday?

392
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,379
Speaker 1: Kineticon ends Sunday night.

393
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:30,174
Speaker 1: There's not that many days because it takes a full day to fly there.

394
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:30,656
Speaker 1: Yeah.

395
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:32,623
Speaker 0: But you cross the date line to actually go back in time.

396
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:40,416
Speaker 1: You get one of the days back, which remember, Scott, one of the ways we're going to lose an extra day and one of the ways we're going to get the day back.

397
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:42,927
Speaker 1: So which side of the trip do you think those two are on?

398
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:45,640
Speaker 0: I can just it's the lines pretty close when you're out there.

399
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,049
Speaker 0: So you can just sort of sail in a boat and get the day back if you want.

400
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:52,305
Speaker 0: I mean, it only takes a couple hours to get out there.

401
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:57,606
Speaker 0: You know, you take a couple hours in the boat, you go out there, you reset in one day.

402
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:57,827
Speaker 0: Yes.

403
00:19:58,068 --> 00:19:59,977
Speaker 0: It's like it's like Half-Minute Hero, right?

404
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:08,144
Speaker 1: Quite a bit of consternation, because as you guys know, for many years now, me and Scott run the panels and workshops department at Kineticon.

405
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:26,663
Speaker 0: And when Robert Coo said that Pax would require difficult decisions, I assumed he meant it would be during San Diego Comic Con, which was going to make it during Pax, but it meant it would be very likely overlapping with Kineticon, which also often overlaps San Diego Comic Con.

406
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:32,044
Speaker 0: But in fact, this year, Kineticon does not overlap San Diego Comic Con, but Pax OS does.

407
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:33,368
Speaker 0: My guess was correct.

408
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:36,197
Speaker 0: However, it often is not a difficult decision.

409
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:40,312
Speaker 0: No, considering we've never been nor will we likely go to San Diego Comic Con.

410
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:43,845
Speaker 1: I mean, honestly, I'm not even going to the New York Comic Con this year.

411
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:44,769
Speaker 0: I'm not either.

412
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,195
Speaker 0: I was half considering.

413
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,038
Speaker 0: So get this.

414
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:49,828
Speaker 0: I was half considering going for a day just to check Scott.

415
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:50,109
Speaker 0: Right.

416
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:53,543
Speaker 0: But number one, there was nothing that I need to see.

417
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:55,593
Speaker 0: Like last year, there was the Kota Shinkai.

418
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:56,156
Speaker 0: Exactly.

419
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:57,422
Speaker 0: But this year there's nothing like that.

420
00:20:57,462 --> 00:20:58,125
Speaker 0: I got to go see.

421
00:20:58,185 --> 00:21:03,228
Speaker 0: And two, when I went, I'm like, oh, I should go back a one day Sunday badge and I go and it's like all sold out.

422
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:03,931
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh, fuck it.

423
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:10,502
Speaker 1: So I've never paid for a badge to New York Comic Con or the New York Anime Festival, but I've been to all of them up until this point.

424
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:15,099
Speaker 1: You didn't go to the first New York Comic Con, the one that was a disaster.

425
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:15,380
Speaker 0: Right.

426
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:16,765
Speaker 1: But I went to all the other ones.

427
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:19,415
Speaker 1: But this year I didn't even bother.

428
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:23,271
Speaker 1: Like, I got the press stuff and, you know, we've gotten a press badge every year for years now.

429
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:27,931
Speaker 1: I didn't even bother because I literally could not think of anything I wanted to cover there.

430
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:32,331
Speaker 1: The only thing I could think of that I wanted to cover is show all the empty panel.

431
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:38,360
Speaker 1: Yes, because I have all this video from last year and the year before where I walked around and all the panel rooms were empty.

432
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,787
Speaker 1: It was all like a publisher announcing a game or announcing like some book or comic that no one gave a shit about to an empty room.

433
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:47,238
Speaker 1: so they could just say that they announced at the con.

434
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:49,328
Speaker 1: And if anyone doubts me, no, I have video.

435
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:53,026
Speaker 0: It's like, dude, if you have a booth, you just you could just announce it at your booth.

436
00:21:53,086 --> 00:21:54,170
Speaker 0: I need to get the panel for.

437
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:54,271
Speaker 0: Yeah.

438
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:55,978
Speaker 1: I don't know.

439
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:56,801
Speaker 1: The New York Comic.

440
00:21:56,841 --> 00:22:07,926
Speaker 0: I also have a feeling right that maybe in general they don't want panels because if there's panels, then people who are going to stay there for the duration, no matter what, are going to spend their time not buying.

441
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:08,368
Speaker 0: Yes.

442
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:14,010
Speaker 1: There is a very specific incentive at the New York Comic Con and events like it to funnel people in and funnel people out.

443
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,221
Speaker 1: New York Auto Show style for the counts.

444
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:20,915
Speaker 1: But yeah, this is maybe we'll do a show on that kind of stuff.

445
00:22:21,096 --> 00:22:27,740
Speaker 1: Anyway, suffice it to say, we're not even going to go to the New York Comic Con, but we will probably be around in the city.

446
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,897
Speaker 1: So if you guys go to it, we may show up in an after party anyway.

447
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:36,790
Speaker 0: Oh, by the way, the New York Comic Con is not this weekend, but next weekend.

448
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,017
Speaker 0: It's October 11th through 14th.

449
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:39,760
Speaker 1: But you know what?

450
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,182
Speaker 1: Fuck that noise, because shortly thereafter, right before Halloween is Burning Apocalypse Con 2012.

451
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:47,789
Speaker 0: I think it's just called Burning Con.

452
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,151
Speaker 0: Is it?

453
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:49,075
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

454
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:49,718
Speaker 1: I signed up.

455
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:51,103
Speaker 1: I haven't even looked at the website.

456
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:52,127
Speaker 1: If there is a website.

457
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:52,669
Speaker 0: It.

458
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,050
Speaker 0: Yeah.

459
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:53,812
Speaker 1: Just burning.

460
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:59,430
Speaker 0: That coincides nicely with the sixth, seventh anniversary of Geek Nights.

461
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:00,093
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait.

462
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,339
Speaker 1: So it's just Burning Con.

463
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,287
Speaker 0: The seventh anniversary of Geek Nights.

464
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:04,432
Speaker 1: It's just Burning Con.

465
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:06,221
Speaker 1: But Vincent Baker is going to be there.

466
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:10,252
Speaker 0: Yes, it's Burning Con 12 colon the Triad Umbert.

467
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:16,753
Speaker 0: That's why it is because it is the Triad Umbert because it includes Luke Crane, Vincent Baker and John Harper.

468
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:18,540
Speaker 0: That's the Triad Umbert.

469
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:22,211
Speaker 0: The three games by those three game designers are acceptable.

470
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:27,735
Speaker 1: I am running in a scenario that I've run at many events to date, and I think it's getting pretty solid.

471
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:28,600
Speaker 0: I thought you ran it once.

472
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,766
Speaker 1: No, I ran it at Burning Con.

473
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:32,874
Speaker 1: I ran it at two recesses.

474
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:33,556
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

475
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:38,874
Speaker 1: And I got to say, running Burning Wheel at a recess really sucks.

476
00:23:38,974 --> 00:23:40,038
Speaker 0: Oh, how was it at the second?

477
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,945
Speaker 0: I don't even hear about how it was at the second recess.

478
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,245
Speaker 0: But not as bad as the first one, though, with the guy who is adversarial, sits down.

479
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:50,434
Speaker 1: He's like, so I hate these fucking indie RPGs.

480
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:52,581
Speaker 0: So why did you sign up for one?

481
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:54,308
Speaker 1: He's like, so what's Burning Wheel got for me?

482
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,743
Speaker 1: One guy in this game was like, you know what I fucking hate?

483
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:59,954
Speaker 1: When a game has a bunch of rules for everything.

484
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:03,712
Speaker 1: Please tell me this game doesn't have like social conflict or any bullshit like that.

485
00:24:03,732 --> 00:24:04,978
Speaker 1: Another guy sits down.

486
00:24:05,018 --> 00:24:09,172
Speaker 1: He's like, I only care about procedural mechanical resolution of conflict.

487
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:12,944
Speaker 1: And these two guys just stared each other down the entire game.

488
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:18,021
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'm running that again and I think it's going to be awesome.

489
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:26,788
Speaker 1: But more importantly, Kehil White, our good friend, really important at PAX Prime and East, you know, read pop and all that.

490
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,640
Speaker 1: He's going to be there doing baby's first Burning Wheel.

491
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:30,463
Speaker 0: Why are you?

492
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:31,888
Speaker 0: why are you making announcement?

493
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:39,542
Speaker 0: That's like saying it's like usually you say someone's going to be at a thing when the person is going to run a thing or if they're, you know, an important.

494
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:42,774
Speaker 0: He signed up just to go to it like everyone else.

495
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:43,175
Speaker 0: Yeah.

496
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:44,822
Speaker 1: You know what else is going to be there?

497
00:24:45,344 --> 00:24:49,582
Speaker 1: Most of our friends not going to be there because they're all wusses who are afraid of running a game.

498
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:50,486
Speaker 1: Because here's the thing.

499
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:55,224
Speaker 1: Burning Con makes you a badass because you are required to run a game.

500
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:58,096
Speaker 0: But this year there is a beginner's track.

501
00:24:58,156 --> 00:25:04,157
Speaker 0: It is more expensive, but don't think the beginner's track gets you out of running a game because it doesn't.

502
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:07,469
Speaker 0: You just get taught on day one by Luke Crane on day two.

503
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:14,756
Speaker 0: You run the game and you could try to be a pussy and show up on day one and learn and not show up on day two.

504
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:15,840
Speaker 0: But then, you know, what happens?

505
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,870
Speaker 0: Luke Crane shows up at your house and you know what?

506
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:21,499
Speaker 0: It's not called Burning Wheel for no reason.

507
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:34,156
Speaker 1: I just picture Luke Crane wearing like some Scandinavian metal black T-shirt and his red rim glasses with a burning wheel KKK style on the lawn.

508
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:39,999
Speaker 0: So, but yes, if you've never even played a tabletop RPG in your life, sign up for a beginner's track.

509
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:41,185
Speaker 0: It'll be totally awesome.

510
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:43,920
Speaker 0: I'm not allowed to sign up for a beginner's track or else I totally would.

511
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,642
Speaker 1: In fact, he makes a big deal about how if you are caught being in the beginner's track and you are a beginner.

512
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:58,676
Speaker 1: Not only are you forced to move to the normal track and you don't get the extra money back, but I think it says that Luke will sit in your game and pester you.

513
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,589
Speaker 0: Oh, that's like a bonus though, except for the burning part.

514
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:04,682
Speaker 1: They also have rules about hacks, which I think is very important.

515
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,130
Speaker 0: I'm not a hack fan, I gotta say.

516
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:09,658
Speaker 1: I am done with hacks at conventions.

517
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:11,567
Speaker 1: I don't know why everyone loves hacks so much.

518
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:13,720
Speaker 0: It's like, just play the game by the fucking rules, all right?

519
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:20,571
Speaker 1: The reason I'm messing with the wheel or inspectors or some indie RPG is because I'm sick of taking a shitty system and hacking it to make it good.

520
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:26,677
Speaker 1: Most people who hack games, not good game designers, the hacks are worse than the actual game.

521
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:26,898
Speaker 0: Right.

522
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:30,326
Speaker 0: Anyway, quick meta moment.

523
00:26:30,346 --> 00:26:31,792
Speaker 0: Are we meta momenting right now?

524
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:32,717
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're meta momenting.

525
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:33,420
Speaker 1: It's long.

526
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, so much meta has piled up.

527
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:37,659
Speaker 1: All right, so I got one more and then you can go.

528
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:48,272
Speaker 1: So we did our lecture at PAX, PAX Prime, and I can't obviously upload video of our stuff at PAX Dev, but I did upload the first of our three mini lectures.

529
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:52,808
Speaker 1: when the game plays the player, AKA, we talk about DDR for 20 minutes.

530
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,556
Speaker 0: Don't hate the player, hate the player.

531
00:26:54,717 --> 00:26:56,685
Speaker 1: And we realized, you know what this panel really is?

532
00:26:56,705 --> 00:26:58,412
Speaker 1: How to be an effective hater 101.

533
00:26:58,412 --> 00:27:03,451
Speaker 1: It's a good panel, and we got to try out our multi-camera angle.

534
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:09,360
Speaker 1: There are one, two, three, four, five distinct, six distinct camera angles in the video.

535
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:14,057
Speaker 0: Anyway, so you know how we have all our things all over the Internet.

536
00:27:14,097 --> 00:27:19,946
Speaker 0: We have websites, we have emails, we have an email newsletter, which I'm going to start mailing again once we start doing something to mail about.

537
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:23,721
Speaker 0: We got Facebook's, we got Twitter's, we got all these things.

538
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:23,922
Speaker 0: Right.

539
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,660
Speaker 0: Well, I have two news is on this front of having things all over the Internet.

540
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,740
Speaker 0: News number one, apparently Facebook is even didn't realize this sort of scammy and shitty.

541
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:40,300
Speaker 0: What Facebook has been doing is if I post something on the night's Twitter, everyone who follows the nights on Twitter sees that if they read their Twitter often enough.

542
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:40,661
Speaker 0: Right.

543
00:27:41,062 --> 00:27:50,314
Speaker 0: If I post something on Geek Nights Facebook page, apparently it will not be guaranteed to show up in everyone's newsfeed who subscribes to the Geek Nights page.

544
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,679
Speaker 0: It will only subscribe.

545
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:54,653
Speaker 0: It will only show up in some small percentage of those people's news feeds.

546
00:27:55,095 --> 00:28:06,355
Speaker 0: And Facebook wants you to pay them money to get like a sponsored page or whatever to guarantee that that message will show up on every on the pay the newsfeed of every person who follows your page.

547
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:12,680
Speaker 0: So if you are using following Geek Nights on Facebook as your primary means of Geek Nights news updates.

548
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,161
Speaker 0: Stop it.

549
00:28:13,844 --> 00:28:14,708
Speaker 0: Well, don't stop it.

550
00:28:14,748 --> 00:28:18,342
Speaker 0: But you may not be seeing everything that we post there in your newsfeed.

551
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:26,946
Speaker 0: You may actually have to go to Facebook dot com slash, you know, front row crew in order to see everything that is posted there.

552
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:31,601
Speaker 0: So we recommend you also follow us with some other means.

553
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,067
Speaker 0: Number two news.

554
00:28:34,127 --> 00:28:40,081
Speaker 0: We are testing the addition of a new place on the Internet for us to be.

555
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:43,891
Speaker 1: I downloaded Merck for the first time.

556
00:28:43,911 --> 00:28:45,254
Speaker 0: You should use IRS's.

557
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:47,099
Speaker 0: I don't use that.

558
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,485
Speaker 1: But I know Merck doesn't.

559
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:49,409
Speaker 0: You shouldn't use that.

560
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:50,655
Speaker 1: Merck is hardcore using.

561
00:28:50,755 --> 00:28:51,840
Speaker 0: No, it's not hardcore.

562
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:54,267
Speaker 0: Use IRS size what you use.

563
00:28:54,348 --> 00:28:55,532
Speaker 1: Well, the hardcore is Telnet.

564
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:56,637
Speaker 0: Yes, we have an hour.

565
00:28:56,717 --> 00:28:59,644
Speaker 0: I made an IRC channel as perch.

566
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:02,093
Speaker 0: If it still exists, you're going to use IRS's.

567
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:02,735
Speaker 0: All right.

568
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:05,303
Speaker 0: So I see you're so fucking stupid.

569
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,550
Speaker 0: It's not nineteen ninety nine anymore.

570
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:10,259
Speaker 1: So you want to feel old, Scott?

571
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,222
Speaker 1: We got to RIT.

572
00:29:11,242 --> 00:29:13,932
Speaker 1: I use Telnet and Elm to read my mail.

573
00:29:14,032 --> 00:29:18,668
Speaker 0: Anyway, I use pine because they actually had pine in those computers despite the licensing issues.

574
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:24,550
Speaker 0: So if you want we have an IRC channel that is currently temporary beta ish.

575
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:26,277
Speaker 0: If it fails, you're just going to stop it.

576
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:29,492
Speaker 0: But if it doesn't fail, I guess people will be chatting in there.

577
00:29:29,512 --> 00:29:30,175
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

578
00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:31,481
Speaker 1: This is the best Web page ever.

579
00:29:31,742 --> 00:29:34,831
Speaker 0: Anyway, going is the second time cube.

580
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:35,633
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

581
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:36,275
Speaker 1: I'm linking to this.

582
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:37,739
Speaker 1: What is IRC?

583
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:39,864
Speaker 0: So the channel?

584
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:44,962
Speaker 0: it's on the phonetic network, which is the same place that has the XKCD IRC chat room.

585
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:51,084
Speaker 0: So you got to you connect to IRC dot phonetic dot net and then you go to, you know, channel geek nights.

586
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:53,031
Speaker 0: And there might be some people in there.

587
00:29:53,352 --> 00:29:55,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't used it yet.

588
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:58,648
Speaker 0: Maybe because you're not using IRS.

589
00:29:59,271 --> 00:30:01,460
Speaker 1: Maybe because I looked at it, no one was there.

590
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:02,803
Speaker 0: That's also true.

591
00:30:02,964 --> 00:30:09,526
Speaker 1: The thing is, what was I remember a long time ago, I said something and someone else said this and I was just paraphrasing.

592
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:15,008
Speaker 1: It was basically IRC, the place where people turn on bots to idle until they die.

593
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:15,670
Speaker 0: That's right.

594
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:17,337
Speaker 0: We actually have one bot in there.

595
00:30:17,378 --> 00:30:21,455
Speaker 0: All it does is keep logs of the chat room and put them on our website.

596
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:24,066
Speaker 0: You can go to front row crew dot com slash IRC slash logs.

597
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:26,659
Speaker 1: You know, if we if we if we want to go old school, we need a bot.

598
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:31,415
Speaker 1: that every time someone types Ubuntu, it writes phonetically Ubuntu.

599
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,161
Speaker 0: You can write whatever kind of bot you want.

600
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:34,988
Speaker 1: I've never written an IRC bot.

601
00:30:35,189 --> 00:30:36,675
Speaker 0: There's plenty easy ways to do that.

602
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,779
Speaker 1: I imagine there are.

603
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:40,452
Speaker 0: It's actually one of the easiest things to program.

604
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:41,439
Speaker 0: You want to learn to program.

605
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:43,365
Speaker 0: That is not a bad project to start with.

606
00:30:43,505 --> 00:30:44,748
Speaker 0: All right.

607
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:45,390
Speaker 0: Let us move on.

608
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:45,952
Speaker 0: Yeah.

609
00:30:46,353 --> 00:30:47,897
Speaker 1: So FTL.

610
00:30:48,318 --> 00:30:51,251
Speaker 0: So there's this game Faster Than Light and it had a Kickstarter in the.

611
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:56,056
Speaker 0: in the time period when I was kick starting like crazy, I saw the Kickstarter page and I was like, damn, that game looks pretty cool.

612
00:30:56,418 --> 00:30:57,503
Speaker 0: I'll drop you some dollars.

613
00:30:57,644 --> 00:31:00,237
Speaker 0: I'll give you the minimum amount of money required to get this game.

614
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:00,680
Speaker 0: So I did.

615
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,809
Speaker 1: I saw it, forgot about it promptly.

616
00:31:02,949 --> 00:31:03,974
Speaker 0: Of course, I forgot about it.

617
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:07,311
Speaker 0: And then they messaged me and they, you know, and they were like, hey, the game came out.

618
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:08,156
Speaker 0: Here's your code.

619
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:08,839
Speaker 0: Go on Steam.

620
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:10,665
Speaker 0: And I'm like, OK, I guess so.

621
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:21,635
Speaker 0: And I got it on Steam and I played it and I was like, oh, shit, this game is actually, whoa, this game is stupid fun and it runs on anything.

622
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:29,149
Speaker 1: So on my laptop, like the one like idle game, if I'm like on a plane or something was Binding of Isaac, because it's basically an actiony kind of roguelike.

623
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:31,641
Speaker 0: And you can when a room is empty, you can start to hang out.

624
00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:35,270
Speaker 1: This is basically the same.

625
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:44,942
Speaker 1: It fills the same niche for me, except I actually really like playing it the entire time I'm playing it, except the time when I get fucked over, which is every time.

626
00:31:46,787 --> 00:31:50,416
Speaker 1: But Scott is not the point of a game like this in the losing.

627
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:53,950
Speaker 0: No, I think there should be a mode that they should have three modes right now.

628
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,000
Speaker 0: They only have two modes, easy and normal.

629
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,269
Speaker 0: And I think number one, that's wrong.

630
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,257
Speaker 0: They should have learned from Super Hexagon.

631
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:05,192
Speaker 0: If you don't have a true easy mode, don't call it easy mode in Super Hexagon.

632
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:09,463
Speaker 0: The easiest mode is called hard faster than light.

633
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:12,794
Speaker 0: They should have named the modes normal and fuck you.

634
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:18,556
Speaker 0: And then they should have added a third mode winnable and they should have added a fourth.

635
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:22,512
Speaker 0: They should have added a fourth mode nightmare because everyone knows what that means.

636
00:32:22,632 --> 00:32:25,544
Speaker 1: But Scott, easy mode is actually really fucking easy.

637
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:27,191
Speaker 0: Easy mode is not winnable.

638
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:28,757
Speaker 0: Try to win the game on easy mode.

639
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:30,003
Speaker 1: I haven't really tried that hard.

640
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,731
Speaker 1: I've never actually played easy mode.

641
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:32,897
Speaker 0: I don't think you can.

642
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,726
Speaker 0: Oh, you just said easy mode is actually really easy.

643
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:35,792
Speaker 0: And then you said you never played it.

644
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:37,781
Speaker 1: Because normal mode is not that.

645
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:39,586
Speaker 0: And it's on tape.

646
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,711
Speaker 0: Easy mode is not easy.

647
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:42,774
Speaker 1: We'll see.

648
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:44,218
Speaker 0: Try to beat the game.

649
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:56,687
Speaker 0: I can get to the boss on easy mode pretty reliably with a particular strategy I've come up with, but I cannot beat the boss with that strategy because it was a very good strategy for getting to the end and a very bad strategy for beating the end.

650
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:00,600
Speaker 1: Watch us work forward as fast as possible.

651
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:06,972
Speaker 0: The problem is, is all the strategies for beating the end, like building my ship up along the way, are very, very bad for getting to the end.

652
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:08,420
Speaker 1: Got to get that crystal ship, man.

653
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:09,987
Speaker 0: I don't have the crystal ship yet.

654
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:11,254
Speaker 1: Do you know how to get it?

655
00:33:11,837 --> 00:33:13,225
Speaker 0: You got to do some unlucky bullshit.

656
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:14,634
Speaker 0: You have to get this too much luck.

657
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,143
Speaker 0: This is the first thing I talk about in this game.

658
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:16,968
Speaker 1: Why do you need too much luck?

659
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,980
Speaker 1: The game, that's the point of this game.

660
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,623
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

661
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:20,829
Speaker 0: I want a no luck version.

662
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:22,115
Speaker 0: It's called the winnable edition.

663
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:25,931
Speaker 1: The point of this game is that it's a rogue like Star Trek simulator.

664
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:34,568
Speaker 0: You can have rogue likes that where you can, there's people where no matter what luck they get in a game of net hack can still go get that amulet at the bottom, whatever it is.

665
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:35,112
Speaker 1: No bullshit.

666
00:33:35,152 --> 00:33:36,560
Speaker 1: Sometimes you usually get fucking killed.

667
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,750
Speaker 0: No, there are people who no matter what, right?

668
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:41,262
Speaker 0: You get two guys, set them up with the same dwarf fortress.

669
00:33:41,363 --> 00:33:42,850
Speaker 0: that's in the exact same thing, right?

670
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:46,647
Speaker 0: And one guy will kick some ass and one guy might die right away because there's no one's doing right.

671
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:50,407
Speaker 0: There is a non luck element that is very significant in rogue likes.

672
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:51,111
Speaker 1: Yes, and you know what?

673
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:55,328
Speaker 1: In FTL there is too, because I've already, there's a fucking, let me find some speed runs on YouTube.

674
00:33:56,491 --> 00:33:57,494
Speaker 0: FTL speed run?

675
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:59,159
Speaker 0: No, why do I suck?

676
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:05,579
Speaker 1: I'm not saying I'm great at this game, but, uh, I don't think you found any.

677
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:06,181
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.

678
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:07,869
Speaker 1: All right, I'll look for the, Oh, here we go.

679
00:34:08,452 --> 00:34:09,456
Speaker 1: FTL speed run.

680
00:34:09,558 --> 00:34:10,060
Speaker 1: No scope.

681
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,683
Speaker 0: No scope.

682
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:15,534
Speaker 0: Is it final destination Fox only?

683
00:34:15,574 --> 00:34:17,360
Speaker 1: So Scott, what is this game?

684
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,425
Speaker 0: So fast and light is basically it's sort of Star Trek, but it doesn't have the whole bridge thing going on, right?

685
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:26,154
Speaker 0: It's, it's sort of an RTS, right?

686
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:31,556
Speaker 0: You, all you see on the screen is your ship and the guys in it and you control them and give them orders.

687
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:34,753
Speaker 0: And in RTS mode, you click on them and you right click to tell them where to go.

688
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,947
Speaker 0: And depending on which room they're in, in your ship, they'll do different things.

689
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,327
Speaker 0: You can also have complete control of the energy in your ship, right?

690
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:47,308
Speaker 0: So you can say, you know, and your ship produces only so much energy and you only have so many places to put it.

691
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:50,402
Speaker 0: So if you have more places to put it, then you have energy available.

692
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:53,496
Speaker 0: You have to decide what to turn on and what to turn off in real time.

693
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:59,562
Speaker 0: So you might say divert energy from the weapons to the shield or turn off some shields to turn on some weapons and stuff like that.

694
00:34:59,582 --> 00:35:00,527
Speaker 1: Look what's going on here.

695
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:11,093
Speaker 1: It's, it's doing the good game design thing of when you think about like Star Trek or any kind of, you know, thing like this, what's, what's always happening in the show, divert power to the engines, right?

696
00:35:11,113 --> 00:35:14,449
Speaker 1: You get to do the thing that you always think about and see in these media.

697
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:19,432
Speaker 0: Well, unless you spend enough, your new resource points to get enough power, that everything is powered all the time.

698
00:35:19,894 --> 00:35:21,602
Speaker 1: You don't have any other stuff to power up.

699
00:35:21,682 --> 00:35:26,139
Speaker 0: So then you need to spend some resource points to make things consume more power.

700
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,798
Speaker 1: The reason this game shines is that you will never have enough fucking anything ever.

701
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:32,179
Speaker 1: Yeah.

702
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:39,840
Speaker 1: You'll be looking, you'll be like, if I turn off the oxygen, I can power up that missile one more time.

703
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:40,642
Speaker 0: Yeah.

704
00:35:40,802 --> 00:35:43,008
Speaker 0: Or I'm out of missiles.

705
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:45,736
Speaker 0: Let me power those fuckers down.

706
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:46,378
Speaker 0: And you know what?

707
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,350
Speaker 0: I'm going to turn off the med bay cause nobody's hurt right now.

708
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,604
Speaker 0: And that gives me enough energy to temporarily boost the shield.

709
00:35:52,704 --> 00:36:01,617
Speaker 1: Now, the most important thing is that this game would be bullshit, but for the fact that you can pause with no penalty at any time and redo all your cause.

710
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:06,863
Speaker 0: it's a single player game, even though it's an RTS, you can pause and it's like, Hey, why doesn't single-player star craft?

711
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:12,410
Speaker 0: just let you fucking pause, give orders and then unpause because then it's such a completely different game, right?

712
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,612
Speaker 0: But it's only in the single player part, you know, it's like, Hey, there's no micro to worry about.

713
00:36:17,632 --> 00:36:19,659
Speaker 0: There's no fast clicking penalty, right?

714
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,218
Speaker 0: Because you can pause, give the guys orders, unpause and you can do it as much as you want.

715
00:36:24,278 --> 00:36:27,572
Speaker 1: The guys follow their orders, you know, slowly or quickly.

716
00:36:27,592 --> 00:36:29,902
Speaker 0: If they're fucking rock guys, they're fucking so slow.

717
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:30,684
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

718
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:31,668
Speaker 0: Rock guys.

719
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,491
Speaker 1: Anyway.

720
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:33,595
Speaker 1: I have some Mantis guys.

721
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:34,357
Speaker 1: I had a rock guy.

722
00:36:34,438 --> 00:36:35,722
Speaker 0: Mantis guys are the best.

723
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:39,616
Speaker 1: So four fucking Mantis guys came into my O2 room and started fucking it up.

724
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,845
Speaker 0: Just everyone runs to the med bay and wait.

725
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,171
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

726
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:43,734
Speaker 1: And you know what?

727
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:46,306
Speaker 1: They fucked it up and then they moved room to room and fucking it up.

728
00:36:46,346 --> 00:36:46,989
Speaker 0: That's what happens.

729
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,211
Speaker 0: Yep.

730
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:47,774
Speaker 0: Yeah.

731
00:36:47,995 --> 00:36:52,155
Speaker 1: And I vented and eventually they destroyed all my systems and then the ship that was there destroyed me.

732
00:36:52,617 --> 00:36:53,441
Speaker 0: Oh, well you have to see.

733
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,090
Speaker 0: the thing is you have to keep, uh, yeah.

734
00:36:56,733 --> 00:37:05,649
Speaker 0: See, usually when someone attacks my ship and they bored me, I just let them destroy all the systems and then they get to the med bay and they lose there because the med bay heals my guys.

735
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:08,944
Speaker 1: They destroy your shields and then the lasers from the ship take you out.

736
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:13,180
Speaker 0: I've actually been rather lucky in that they sort of avoid the shield room.

737
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,385
Speaker 0: They go to the med room first.

738
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:14,847
Speaker 1: You know what?

739
00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:15,410
Speaker 1: You know what?

740
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,636
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm going to feel dumb.

741
00:37:17,098 --> 00:37:22,075
Speaker 1: The room with the door control, I didn't realize what that was until it got destroyed.

742
00:37:22,356 --> 00:37:22,938
Speaker 0: Oh, good job.

743
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:23,841
Speaker 1: So I was fine.

744
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:24,664
Speaker 1: I'm playing my game.

745
00:37:24,705 --> 00:37:25,829
Speaker 1: Everything's going okay.

746
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:31,051
Speaker 1: And then these Mantis fuckers come on my ship to fuck my shit up and I'm like, all right, I'll just vent.

747
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:35,648
Speaker 1: So I opened up all the doors to vent those guys out and my guys are hiding in the med bay.

748
00:37:35,668 --> 00:37:39,762
Speaker 1: And then that room with the two vertical things broke.

749
00:37:40,644 --> 00:37:45,135
Speaker 1: And then I took out the Mantis and then I couldn't close the doors.

750
00:37:45,155 --> 00:37:49,672
Speaker 0: And what you do is you send two of the guys into the door room to fix it.

751
00:37:49,692 --> 00:37:51,340
Speaker 0: And then they, the room that had no oxygen, right?

752
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,603
Speaker 0: But they have to keep running in and out a whole bunch because it's right next to the med bay and the normal ship.

753
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:57,675
Speaker 0: You keep running in and out a whole bunch until it's repaired.

754
00:37:57,896 --> 00:37:58,057
Speaker 1: Yeah.

755
00:37:58,097 --> 00:38:00,709
Speaker 1: I was one, not in a normal ship until, uh, it didn't work out.

756
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:01,432
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

757
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:01,975
Speaker 0: But yeah.

758
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:05,407
Speaker 1: And then you can, uh, yeah, it's not a good situation.

759
00:38:05,588 --> 00:38:05,728
Speaker 0: No.

760
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:08,559
Speaker 1: I also have the trouble of rock man defense.

761
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:08,900
Speaker 1: Great.

762
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,667
Speaker 1: Rock man cannot catch Mantis man.

763
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:13,954
Speaker 0: No, no.

764
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:18,810
Speaker 0: Mantis man's actually the strongest at fighting damage wise, at least indoors.

765
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,244
Speaker 1: I like how some weapons you can target your own ship and try to shoot a guy.

766
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:22,404
Speaker 1: Yeah.

767
00:38:22,686 --> 00:38:30,582
Speaker 0: But the biggest problem in this game is that you level up right either by, you know, you find equipment, you get what's scrap, which is basically money used to buy upgrades.

768
00:38:30,703 --> 00:38:33,434
Speaker 1: Also your dudes get better by whatever they're doing.

769
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:39,261
Speaker 0: So if a guy does this, you want to make sure the same guy is always doing the same job, but like the same guy is always in the engine room.

770
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,823
Speaker 0: Then he becomes the engineer and gets really good at it, which gives you a slight bonus to engineering.

771
00:38:42,843 --> 00:38:47,163
Speaker 1: Now it's also a super fun sort of mini game of like, you have a guy like this guy's my engineer.

772
00:38:47,183 --> 00:38:49,592
Speaker 1: He's going to do my engines, my repair.

773
00:38:49,934 --> 00:38:51,380
Speaker 1: You kind of like specialize your guys.

774
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:53,446
Speaker 1: Then you're fuck is one of them dies.

775
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:53,546
Speaker 1: Yeah.

776
00:38:56,014 --> 00:38:56,294
Speaker 0: Yeah.

777
00:38:56,515 --> 00:39:01,853
Speaker 1: And it's like, so far, this is a nine minute speed run and the guys doing okay.

778
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:02,375
Speaker 0: All right.

779
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:06,931
Speaker 0: The biggest problem I have in the game is number one, even on easy, you don't get enough scrap.

780
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:08,978
Speaker 0: That's good to buy all that.

781
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:12,596
Speaker 0: You can't fully upgrade all the things you wouldn't be able to, otherwise it'd be boring.

782
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:14,042
Speaker 1: It'd be like cow click winnable.

783
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:16,250
Speaker 0: Uh, two, right.

784
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:22,459
Speaker 0: The other problem is that even if you get the scrap, you know, go to the shops and they just might not have the thing you want to get.

785
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:23,825
Speaker 0: It's like, it's no consistency.

786
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:29,312
Speaker 0: So it's like, I got a strategy that involves stealth and it's just, you can always spend that on the ship instead.

787
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:29,594
Speaker 0: Right.

788
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:36,077
Speaker 0: But it's like you go to the first shop and there's no stealth and you go to the next shop and there's no stealth and you're already like halfway through the game and you still haven't found the stealth device.

789
00:39:36,097 --> 00:39:36,420
Speaker 0: You know what?

790
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,437
Speaker 1: If you still think that stealth is going to be your thing, you should give up on it.

791
00:39:40,658 --> 00:39:41,402
Speaker 0: But that it's like.

792
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:49,899
Speaker 0: then you need the stealth because the final boss, he shoots you with this fricking, you know, fricking multi-drone attack and you need to enable stealth right then.

793
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:50,742
Speaker 0: That's the way to beat him.

794
00:39:50,782 --> 00:39:54,076
Speaker 1: To me, the point of this game is that you can't do everything.

795
00:39:54,096 --> 00:39:54,799
Speaker 1: It is so hard.

796
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:57,971
Speaker 1: It's just make do with what you got and see how far you can get.

797
00:39:58,432 --> 00:39:59,155
Speaker 0: Yeah.

798
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:04,175
Speaker 1: The fact that the end is so unattainable and so difficult actually adds a lot of the fun.

799
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:08,555
Speaker 1: When I finally beat this game, I'm going to throw whatever I'm holding in my hand at the nearest wall.

800
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:09,820
Speaker 0: Here's why I disagree, right?

801
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,962
Speaker 0: You look at a roguelike, like say the Dwarf Fortress, and there is no win in Dwarf Fortress.

802
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:17,151
Speaker 0: Like what's the goal of Dwarf Fortress?

803
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,703
Speaker 0: You play until you lose and the losing is spectacular.

804
00:40:19,763 --> 00:40:21,251
Speaker 1: Actually, that's the one main gig.

805
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,558
Speaker 1: night's lecture we have no video of.

806
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,787
Speaker 0: In Faster Than Light, there is a goal.

807
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:26,894
Speaker 0: It is get to the end and beat that boss.

808
00:40:27,055 --> 00:40:29,684
Speaker 0: And it's not fun to not beat the boss.

809
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:30,408
Speaker 1: To me it is.

810
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:31,814
Speaker 1: I don't care if I don't beat the boss.

811
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:33,059
Speaker 1: It's like Oregon Trail.

812
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,509
Speaker 1: When I finally beat that fucker, it was great.

813
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:37,316
Speaker 0: But I'm never going to beat that fucker.

814
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:39,826
Speaker 1: Well then you're not willing to invest enough into it.

815
00:40:39,926 --> 00:40:40,910
Speaker 1: I've already played this game.

816
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,995
Speaker 0: like how many times?

817
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:44,183
Speaker 1: How good are Counter-Strike?

818
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:45,809
Speaker 0: I'm pretty good.

819
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,936
Speaker 1: So Scott, this is still a speedrun.

820
00:40:47,996 --> 00:40:49,662
Speaker 1: I'm watching this guy beat the game.

821
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:50,524
Speaker 0: He got lucky.

822
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:51,507
Speaker 1: Anyway.

823
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:52,791
Speaker 0: He got real lucky.

824
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:54,457
Speaker 1: Right now his shields are still down.

825
00:40:54,477 --> 00:40:54,878
Speaker 1: Go on.

826
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:55,038
Speaker 1: Yeah.

827
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,914
Speaker 0: The other thing is like not even memorization will help you beat this game.

828
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:00,000
Speaker 1: Whoa, that's all Nebula.

829
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, you've never been to an all Nebula?

830
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:02,893
Speaker 0: I have not.

831
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:05,786
Speaker 0: I guess because you've only played a normal, you've never gotten to one of those.

832
00:41:05,806 --> 00:41:09,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's whole quadrants that are just sectors that are entirely Nebula.

833
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:10,707
Speaker 0: The purple ones.

834
00:41:10,988 --> 00:41:13,236
Speaker 1: I usually go straight for like Rockland.

835
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:14,421
Speaker 1: Hoping to get a right guy.

836
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:16,847
Speaker 0: I just go all green as much as possible.

837
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:19,333
Speaker 0: What was I saying?

838
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:20,777
Speaker 0: Whatever.

839
00:41:20,797 --> 00:41:21,679
Speaker 0: F this game.

840
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:21,920
Speaker 1: What?

841
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,702
Speaker 1: He just died.

842
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:23,484
Speaker 1: Wait, what?

843
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:24,929
Speaker 1: Oh, it's over.

844
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:25,591
Speaker 0: He lost.

845
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:26,794
Speaker 0: What a speedrun.

846
00:41:27,015 --> 00:41:27,938
Speaker 0: Yeah.

847
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:28,680
Speaker 0: No scope.

848
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:32,859
Speaker 0: No scope is why he got shot, Rimden.

849
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:44,561
Speaker 1: I am fine with the fact that this game is goddamn impossible because that adds a lot of the fun to me.

850
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:46,467
Speaker 0: Yeah.

851
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:47,872
Speaker 0: Wait until you're pissed.

852
00:41:47,932 --> 00:41:48,635
Speaker 0: he can't beat it.

853
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:49,698
Speaker 0: What's the point of this game?

854
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:50,422
Speaker 1: What do you get?

855
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:51,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're going to see.

856
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:58,184
Speaker 0: You're going to get good enough to get to the point where you can get to the final boss reliably and then wait till you see what that final boss is like and then you're going to agree with me.

857
00:41:58,204 --> 00:42:01,782
Speaker 0: The only reason you don't agree with me now is because you haven't seen the final boss.

858
00:42:01,802 --> 00:42:04,570
Speaker 1: I enjoy games.

859
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:07,620
Speaker 0: You don't know what the final boss is like at all, do you?

860
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:09,746
Speaker 1: I know he has three stages.

861
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:11,173
Speaker 0: Yeah, what else do you know about him?

862
00:42:11,193 --> 00:42:11,574
Speaker 0: That's it.

863
00:42:11,755 --> 00:42:13,785
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is why you are not in agreement with me.

864
00:42:13,846 --> 00:42:18,248
Speaker 0: So I'm going to assume that you actually do agree with me because you don't know what happens at the end.

865
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,517
Speaker 1: Scott, I enjoy that kind of bullshit.

866
00:42:20,678 --> 00:42:22,003
Speaker 0: No, you don't understand.

867
00:42:22,184 --> 00:42:30,299
Speaker 1: Remember when we played Crystal Chronicles for the first time and we beat that first stage and that second and that third and they're just carrying more stages.

868
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,086
Speaker 1: That was like a four hour boss battle.

869
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:35,098
Speaker 0: Well, that was the square, square, square, square Tesseract boss.

870
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:41,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember dying at a later stage and realizing we had to go back that four hours and start over.

871
00:42:43,421 --> 00:42:44,867
Speaker 1: So, yes, I do know what that is like.

872
00:42:44,907 --> 00:42:45,409
Speaker 1: And you know what?

873
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:46,292
Speaker 1: Bring it.

874
00:42:47,155 --> 00:42:48,500
Speaker 0: No, baby.

875
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:51,887
Speaker 1: This game is stupid fun.

876
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:53,936
Speaker 1: Everyone should buy it and play it.

877
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:54,820
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's true.

878
00:42:55,681 --> 00:42:56,162
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

879
00:42:56,563 --> 00:42:58,208
Speaker 1: So everyone should buy it and play it.

880
00:42:58,569 --> 00:42:59,532
Speaker 1: It's stupid fun.

881
00:43:00,154 --> 00:43:01,658
Speaker 1: Yet you hate it.

882
00:43:01,678 --> 00:43:01,738
Speaker 0: Yes.

883
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,632
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
