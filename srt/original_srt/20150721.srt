00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,261
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:31,230
Speaker 1: I would have tried to make a joke about like yeah, you don't know Jack, but I don't know anyone.

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,096
Speaker 1: I don't think I've ever known anyone named Jack In my entire life.

8
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:43,645
Speaker 0: I did camp counselor was named Jack one really yeah Maybe maybe my roommate and I had a co-worker named Jack that roommate at RIT.

9
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,090
Speaker 1: I never knew his name might have been Jack.

10
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:45,994
Speaker 1: I don't really know.

11
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:46,476
Speaker 0: I don't know.

12
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:47,561
Speaker 0: don't ask me about your roommate.

13
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, just don't ask me about my roommate.

14
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:52,502
Speaker 1: People always think it's weird that I never knew the dude's name.

15
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:53,568
Speaker 1: We never talked to each other.

16
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:57,285
Speaker 1: We just sat back to back and that was.

17
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:57,748
Speaker 1: that was it.

18
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:02,829
Speaker 1: Our only interaction was once he said yes something happened to your fridge when that wine bottle exploded in it.

19
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:09,068
Speaker 0: I Beat a. I beat a Porsche 911 in a race today on my bike.

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:17,370
Speaker 0: oh Yeah, I know that sounds impossible But there was a lot of traffic in his way and I can get through Emily and I beat the seven train on Sunday.

21
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:18,514
Speaker 0: It's not hard either.

22
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:23,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, we biked to flushing and yeah, we can bike to flushing way faster than the seven goes to flushing.

23
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:29,066
Speaker 1: It's a nice bike though, there's basically a bike path that goes almost straight there the whole way.

24
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:29,890
Speaker 0: yeah pretty much.

25
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,909
Speaker 1: We also found a secret path back that I never used before.

26
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,474
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, cuz I said I wouldn't talk about the commute But I can talk about this.

27
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:49,170
Speaker 1: so instead of going on the one side of Citi Field We went like on the backside by all that weird car repair districts you mean Willits Point yeah that whole area there, and you went along the water.

28
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:55,849
Speaker 1: No So there's a. it looks like you're gonna get on the freeway and get the more you bike.

29
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:56,473
Speaker 1: that way You're like.

30
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:58,530
Speaker 1: this is just taking me onto the freeway.

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,710
Speaker 1: I'm going on the freeway and now it's telling me to go into a parking lot.

32
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:13,410
Speaker 1: And then actually on the freeway by the movie theater no There's a little hidden bike path that I never would have even known was there And it's kind of creepy and isolated and like at this weird place.

33
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,506
Speaker 1: I only found it because I had Google Glass on and I was like glass.

34
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:24,500
Speaker 1: take me home And it told me a bikeway, and I kind of followed it despite my better judgment saying this doesn't seem right But it totally was right.

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,329
Speaker 0: this goes along the water to the West.

36
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:28,875
Speaker 1: No, that's not.

37
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:31,028
Speaker 0: I don't know where the hell you're talking about you.

38
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:35,350
Speaker 1: on a map It's not long because you get to the normal bike path right after all that.

39
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:37,362
Speaker 1: But there's just one little like shunt.

40
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:38,629
Speaker 1: it goes through a weird place.

41
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Didn't expect you to.

42
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,609
Speaker 1: I just found a cool path.

43
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:47,698
Speaker 0: How do I doubt the coolness of your path?

44
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,847
Speaker 1: it was pretty cool, uh-huh, I was very pleased with this path.

45
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:54,603
Speaker 1: sure I Can't talk about anything else related to biking.

46
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:55,429
Speaker 1: Thanks to my promise.

47
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:59,550
Speaker 0: Is there any gaming news that has a ton of gaming news?

48
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:02,109
Speaker 0: Way too much gaming news if you haven't done a show in a long time.

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,104
Speaker 1: We actually I think wasn't our last show a gaming show.

50
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:06,130
Speaker 0: that was a long time ago.

51
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:07,695
Speaker 1: I was like right before kinetic on.

52
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:13,995
Speaker 1: it wasn't that long ago still yeah, so we were at kinetic on and There's a bunch of gaming news.

53
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:15,159
Speaker 1: so first off.

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,165
Speaker 1: There is the Kickstarter.

55
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,749
Speaker 1: that happened that we haven't talked about it all yet.

56
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:25,559
Speaker 0: Shenmue 3 Full and I never played Shenmue 1 or 2. so why would I?

57
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:33,190
Speaker 0: These games on like the Sega Saturn or the Dreamcast or whatever there isn't or a PlayStation.

58
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:34,994
Speaker 0: They were on systems I didn't have and couldn't play.

59
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:45,480
Speaker 1: these games are those games that a lot of people I knew knew people who were really into them But I never really knew anyone who was really into them.

60
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:48,349
Speaker 1: and the best way I can describe them is you know how?

61
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:48,830
Speaker 1: in modern?

62
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,435
Speaker 1: Pokemon games there's a mill.

63
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:54,890
Speaker 1: you just wander around and do a bunch of million things that don't really matter at all.

64
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,437
Speaker 1: Imagine that times a hundred.

65
00:03:57,477 --> 00:04:00,550
Speaker 0: yeah everything ever read about this game would simultaneously be like whoa.

66
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,698
Speaker 0: That's so cool like you can do everything.

67
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:10,957
Speaker 0: It's like real-life simulator almost, but then it's like oh There's no reason to do everything It's just a time waster.

68
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:12,826
Speaker 0: you might as well be rune factory for.

69
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:13,710
Speaker 1: well in fact there.

70
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,796
Speaker 1: Well rune factory 4 has the dating element.

71
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:22,009
Speaker 0: It has dating and farming and monster killing and all the things yeah as every possible thing.

72
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:23,753
Speaker 1: Well, there's a.

73
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:25,217
Speaker 0: that's all there is in life right?

74
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:28,507
Speaker 1: remember that old old old penny arcade comic about those games.

75
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:29,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

76
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:35,308
Speaker 1: So what's interesting is that this was the definition of an old?

77
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:50,950
Speaker 1: Popular franchise that it just sort of disappeared that was definitely niche Not actually that widely played or that why I had so much critical Acclaims and the people who did get into it and didn't enjoy it.

78
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,730
Speaker 1: It was like the best thing for much like Sonic the fans Sonic the Hedgehog erotic fiction.

79
00:04:56,252 --> 00:05:00,449
Speaker 1: It's one of those things where there's a small, but extremely vocal and dedicated fan base.

80
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:06,166
Speaker 1: So yeah the Kickstarter happened, and it raised like over six million dollars.

81
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:06,928
Speaker 0: That's about right.

82
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:07,249
Speaker 0: Yeah,

83
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:30,960
Speaker 1: well What's interesting to me the the the point about this is that a lot of people were saying we're complaining That the game raised so much money and a lot of other people seem to have really overblown expectations about the game like because it raised such a huge amount that the game is gonna be like the fully realized vision of Wander around and randomly do stuff in convenience stores.

84
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,290
Speaker 0: the game six million dollars isn't a lot of money.

85
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:36,170
Speaker 1: No, okay for a budget for a game like this.

86
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:41,529
Speaker 0: Maybe if they had 30 million it would be that you need more than that.

87
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:49,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this game's not going to be the second coming of Jesus Or I guess the first coming is Jesus never existed, but I digress.

88
00:05:50,211 --> 00:06:02,259
Speaker 1: But it is very interesting to me that This kind of property was remembered enough by people dedicated enough to our 70,000 people collectively pledged Six million dollars.

89
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,303
Speaker 0: Can you emulate this thing?

90
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:04,930
Speaker 0: I'm curious to go and play the old ones.

91
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,518
Speaker 0: Should we do it see what the reality is?

92
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,549
Speaker 1: should we just play these games?

93
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,277
Speaker 0: It's not possible to emulate them.

94
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:12,101
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna do it.

95
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:14,090
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna buy a Dreamcast or some shit.

96
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:19,153
Speaker 1: I'll bet you can get one on eBay real cheap Whatever.

97
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:19,917
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

98
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:22,110
Speaker 1: No, I mean we might have a Dreamcast.

99
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,016
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have one laying around.

100
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:24,284
Speaker 0: you have a Dreamcast just laying around.

101
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:24,788
Speaker 0: No, you don't.

102
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,542
Speaker 1: I have someone we know probably has one that someone you know, but you don't.

103
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:30,790
Speaker 1: yeah, I'll have that pile of any s's.

104
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,626
Speaker 1: I'll trade someone.

105
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:39,961
Speaker 1: Actually, one of the any s's has a low serial number and apparently people who really care about this too much Care about their what.

106
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:41,830
Speaker 1: which of the 11?

107
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,329
Speaker 1: Versions of the chip or the board in an any s you have?

108
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,970
Speaker 0: well One of those is my any s and one of them is I think your brothers or something.

109
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:51,880
Speaker 1: Well, and there was the third one that we gave away to someone.

110
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,178
Speaker 1: I forget when but that was the one that we won When I won.

111
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:56,601
Speaker 1: right right.

112
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:57,446
Speaker 1: so come turn him.

113
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:58,030
Speaker 0: That's right.

114
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:01,690
Speaker 0: So the one I think your original any s is the one that got given away.

115
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we have the duck hunt one that we won and we we we we I won Sure.

116
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,270
Speaker 0: and then my original any s from when I was a kid.

117
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,422
Speaker 0: So mine is probably the old.

118
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:13,890
Speaker 0: mine came with a red gun though.

119
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:15,150
Speaker 0: So it can't be red guns.

120
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,639
Speaker 0: Not the old one can't be old if it has the red gun.

121
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,934
Speaker 1: the difference between them is actually useful if you're a collector Like it actually is.

122
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:22,918
Speaker 0: what's the difference?

123
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:26,130
Speaker 1: the earliest boards have no lockout at all?

124
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,479
Speaker 1: So every tangen bootleg bullshit cartridge will totally work fine.

125
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,144
Speaker 0: Mine worked with tangen Tetris.

126
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:39,847
Speaker 0: Yeah with micro machines I never tried my and those Bible games never tried Bible games but we definitely were able to play tangen Tetris on that any s. cuz it happened.

127
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:44,545
Speaker 1: so as Versions came out the last versions of the any s actually locked out.

128
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:49,570
Speaker 1: top loader everything You mean top loader know the lat of the original any s the top loader even diff.

129
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:52,361
Speaker 1: No, the top loader had a different board.

130
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:54,590
Speaker 0: Okay, but the top loader was the last any s.

131
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:58,089
Speaker 1: Yes, but it was also a different iteration of the any s. it was a different sku.

132
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,817
Speaker 1: It wasn't just a different board.

133
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,307
Speaker 0: inside of the same sku my cousin had top loader.

134
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:06,256
Speaker 1: Yeah I Remember when the top loader came out.

135
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:08,906
Speaker 1: I couldn't understand why anyone didn't already have an any s.

136
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:10,693
Speaker 0: Yeah Either.

137
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:11,557
Speaker 0: and now it's like man.

138
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,324
Speaker 0: I wish had a top loader so much more reliable.

139
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:14,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what this gives me?

140
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,131
Speaker 1: Hope.

141
00:08:15,472 --> 00:08:18,123
Speaker 1: I'm now waiting for the radish skull and devil.

142
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:19,549
Speaker 0: doll Kickstarter make it.

143
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:26,201
Speaker 0: Yeah, just make it and hope that the guy who made radish skull and devil now sees it And decides that he's actually gonna make it.

144
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:27,910
Speaker 1: I don't think he owns the copyright though.

145
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,643
Speaker 1: Remember all that complicated story of why they didn't own thing.

146
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:32,010
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't think he does.

147
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,678
Speaker 1: That's why the rest of it didn't get made.

148
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:35,426
Speaker 1: That was like a promotional thing.

149
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:36,190
Speaker 0: So that's your news.

150
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:37,460
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a psychonauts.

151
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,629
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for that to get remade.

152
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:42,342
Speaker 1: All those games all those weird things gives me.

153
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:47,981
Speaker 1: Hope that maybe in a far future They'll be an advanced Wars Kickstarter Rampart Kickstarter Rampart Kickstarter.

154
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:49,144
Speaker 1: We just make rampart.

155
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:50,186
Speaker 1: just fucking remake it.

156
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:56,237
Speaker 1: kaboom - yeah electric boogaloo bombaloo You got any news.

157
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:06,060
Speaker 0: There's so much gaming news going on I can't even Touch but I just want to pick this gaming news since I have the most to say about it Even though there's probably more important.

158
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,126
Speaker 0: gaming news is out there.

159
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:16,282
Speaker 0: Yep So I guess ESWC stands for eSports world championship or European something world championship.

160
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:19,070
Speaker 1: I actually can't keep all the league straight in my head anymore.

161
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, look it up ever.

162
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,122
Speaker 1: I don't

163
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:44,843
Speaker 0: know but You know, it was a eSports championship of some kind and There was counter-strike played there and this guy on team Nehillum or Nylem or whatever named Simpis S-E-M-P-H-I-S is doing this interview about what happened there and He just comes out and admits that his whole team was on Adderall the whole time

164
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:46,850
Speaker 1: which like that's actually pretty common.

165
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:54,188
Speaker 0: I mean if there's such high stakes and you want to win and there's no rule against it and there's no drug test Why wouldn't you?

166
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,750
Speaker 1: Yep, that's why we have drug testing in professional sports, right?

167
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:12,709
Speaker 0: So, you know, this is something that you know, this is yet another example of something we've been talking about for years That actually came to be or is actually now in the spotlight and it's like, yep, look how smart we are.

168
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:26,361
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's interesting because you know, actually one of our packs panel to talk about about a moment But we are doing a panel sports or games talking about games and sports and the overlap A moment of that panel discussing this rather this topic.

169
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:43,464
Speaker 1: Yes, and it'll be really interesting because we're seeing gaming and professional gaming go through all the same sort of learning curves as professional sports and interestingly very few of the leagues seem to be Actively looking at like the NFL like what do they do?

170
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:44,710
Speaker 1: Why don't we just do that?

171
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:51,749
Speaker 0: I mean and you know and you think about okay So the big eSports leagues might do something about this eventually or maybe they won't.

172
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:55,263
Speaker 0: maybe It's like well if you want to win eSports, you're gonna take Adderall, right?

173
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:56,347
Speaker 0: Otherwise, how are you gonna compete?

174
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:03,350
Speaker 0: Yeah But what does this say for like your local Street Fighter tournament at your college, right?

175
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,090
Speaker 0: One guy takes Adderall and wins well at the same.

176
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,418
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the difference is do you know some?

177
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,396
Speaker 0: or and as time goes on you think Adderall is gonna be like the only Drug, right?

178
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,770
Speaker 0: There's gonna be some crazy shit out there.

179
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,634
Speaker 0: You can take it's like I.

180
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:18,490
Speaker 1: you know, I run like dumpy local races and I'll you know win a trophy or whatever.

181
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:23,449
Speaker 1: But if I wanted to really what if I just started using strychnine to win those races?

182
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:24,875
Speaker 0: Well, they'll kill you also.

183
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:29,629
Speaker 1: No strychnine was actually so, you know how we should all have a race walking Cuz it's a terrible sport.

184
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,733
Speaker 0: There's drugs and racewalk.

185
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:37,129
Speaker 1: race walking might be the first sport that people use performance enhancing drugs in.

186
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:43,949
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah, they would dope themselves up on strychnine and all sorts of stuff just to keep it going just to keep walking keep walking.

187
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:45,516
Speaker 0: But that doesn't.

188
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:46,160
Speaker 0: how could that help?

189
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,501
Speaker 1: it does.

190
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:47,165
Speaker 1: it keeps you awake.

191
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:48,009
Speaker 1: it's they would use.

192
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,996
Speaker 0: Sleeping is what makes you lose.

193
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:54,190
Speaker 1: Well, so in the old days race walking was more of a endurance challenge.

194
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,250
Speaker 1: It was just whoever goes the longest.

195
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:57,574
Speaker 1: Mmm.

196
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:00,135
Speaker 1: days and days and days and days and days The sports.

197
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:02,470
Speaker 1: they fucked up history and it's still a terrible sport.

198
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:09,877
Speaker 0: But if you needed one more reason to hate it, but I mean take for example, right like the netrunner world champion, Dan Yeah, he's an okay guy.

199
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:11,606
Speaker 0: Yeah ish right ish.

200
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:12,470
Speaker 0: He's okay.

201
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:16,170
Speaker 0: He's not like a bad person and he's really fucking good at netrunner.

202
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,590
Speaker 0: But it's like we're at the Philly regionals.

203
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,348
Speaker 0: It is his local store and he's just like vaping in you know, because the store doesn't stop him.

204
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:24,930
Speaker 0: It's his store.

205
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,493
Speaker 0: They don't care.

206
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:27,043
Speaker 0: so I can't say anything about it.

207
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:31,293
Speaker 0: if the store allows it All right, may or may not and it's like state be illegal I don't know.

208
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:36,349
Speaker 0: I don't know about the laws or anything, but in terms of the fairness of this tournament I mean, it's just a small time.

209
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:45,410
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a netrunner regional, but I mean a netrunner regional might as well be like, you know In terms of all the gaming sports tournaments in the world, that's pretty low bar, right?

210
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,036
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's probably even smaller than your local 5k race or whatever You know, and it's it.

211
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:52,726
Speaker 0: he's taking drugs.

212
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:53,490
Speaker 0: Is it helping him?

213
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:05,668
Speaker 0: I mean part of the tournament is that you got to play seven rounds in netrunner and then elimination rounds You know and last the whole day and keep concentrating and stay on your a-game the whole time from 11 a.m To like 11 midnight midnight.

214
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:10,575
Speaker 1: So here's there's the question that that will Right.

215
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:11,959
Speaker 1: when should he be?

216
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:15,670
Speaker 0: even if you made him go outside is he still is that easy allowed to do that?

217
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:22,410
Speaker 1: When and why did the NHL and the NFL and Major League Baseball and all these things crack down on start testing for drugs in sports?

218
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:28,570
Speaker 1: Was it not partially because the government started getting involved and poking his nose and saying I do something?

219
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:37,269
Speaker 1: I don't think the government is capable of even understanding that video games Played professionally are a thing for at least 20 more years.

220
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:44,710
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know if the it's because the big big professional sports in the US are regulated in some ways by the government?

221
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:51,239
Speaker 1: Yes, partly because of the money and the infrastructure and also, you know The government just had a vested interest for various reasons.

222
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,310
Speaker 0: plus when you know, and the the sports leagues buy into this, right?

223
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,665
Speaker 0: You know, there's all the controversies about like, you know, the local people buying stadiums for the teams.

224
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,213
Speaker 0: It's like well sure It's like.

225
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,566
Speaker 0: we probably shouldn't be doing that definitely shouldn't be.

226
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:11,550
Speaker 0: but if we are Suddenly right there the sports leagues are allowing all that sort of government interference to come in.

227
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,370
Speaker 0: It's like well, we bought you a stadium which means now we can get fuck you over.

228
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,530
Speaker 1: But I I don't think there will be any such pressure from the government unless the story and the narrative become.

229
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:24,810
Speaker 1: Kids are doping themselves up in these video game tournaments.

230
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:30,150
Speaker 1: But I suspect the reaction will be banning video game tournaments not regulating them like we regulate the NFL.

231
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:34,966
Speaker 0: But I mean, you know, the other thing is like why even ban this right?

232
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:35,247
Speaker 0: Why not?

233
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:35,869
Speaker 0: Just allow it.

234
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:43,960
Speaker 1: well, you make the same argument about football right and the answer is it fucks you up and Maybe we shouldn't encourage football.

235
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,485
Speaker 0: fucks you up drugs or no drugs.

236
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:46,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the drugs do not help.

237
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:48,797
Speaker 0: So use baseball as your example instead.

238
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:49,740
Speaker 1: Okay or tennis.

239
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:50,864
Speaker 0: Yeah tennis great.

240
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:52,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not allow it in tennis?

241
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,510
Speaker 1: Well, because those drugs do have hired increase like increased chances of death.

242
00:14:56,852 --> 00:15:01,555
Speaker 0: Let's say someone invented a performance enhancing drug that Didn't really hurt you that much.

243
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:03,764
Speaker 0: I mean is Adderall really gonna shorten your life that much?

244
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,030
Speaker 1: really maybe you don't know.

245
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,718
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not a pharmacologist.

246
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:08,950
Speaker 0: It's not like you're not like you're on crack or meth.

247
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:13,524
Speaker 1: It's more the question of do you want sports to go down that road?

248
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:17,699
Speaker 1: because then everyone in that sport Will have to go down that road to compete.

249
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:23,970
Speaker 1: and if that is the case and there are adverse effects You're probably causing a net harm to society for no tangible benefit.

250
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:28,432
Speaker 0: It's also creates this barrier to entry where like someone like me I can't.

251
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:36,342
Speaker 0: if you know everyone in the whole who plays this game is taking this drug and I don't want to take that drug Then I can't compete in that sport.

252
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:37,790
Speaker 0: That's like an unfair barrier to entry.

253
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,319
Speaker 0: Imagine if you want to go get a job, right?

254
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:39,922
Speaker 0: Remember sports.

255
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:40,425
Speaker 1: All right, Scott.

256
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:42,816
Speaker 0: I'll turn around To go get a job.

257
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:46,390
Speaker 0: and they're like if you want this job, you must snort some cocaine.

258
00:15:46,631 --> 00:15:48,097
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you can't have this job.

259
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:49,403
Speaker 0: That's basically what they're saying.

260
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:50,548
Speaker 1: I'll play the devil's advocate.

261
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:52,959
Speaker 1: back at you I got a kind of real example.

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,065
Speaker 0: that is sports or a job.

263
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:58,241
Speaker 1: Yeah, so For my job I pretty much have to be able to drink alcohol.

264
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,448
Speaker 1: with people like.

265
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:03,650
Speaker 1: I can Drink less and actually I have more than one dump drinks out in bushes.

266
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:13,807
Speaker 1: but if I didn't drink alcohol and didn't hide that fact a lot of people would like it would be difficult for me to do Business because that's just how that world is.

267
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,148
Speaker 1: So you couldn't do my job.

268
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:18,585
Speaker 1: This is the barrier to the same barrier to entry.

269
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:19,069
Speaker 1: Is that okay?

270
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:21,098
Speaker 0: Probably not.

271
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:21,584
Speaker 1: Yeah.

272
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:22,810
Speaker 1: All right Here's another example.

273
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:30,321
Speaker 1: There is a barrier to entry to baseball in that you have to be super strong and you have to be willing to work out a Bunch, are you willing to do pull-ups every day?

274
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:31,989
Speaker 1: or is that a barrier to entry?

275
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,190
Speaker 0: Right?

276
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,437
Speaker 0: Well, I mean that's the thing is right.

277
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:35,510
Speaker 0: It's like genetics Gattaca, right?

278
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,690
Speaker 0: I mean there are certain things that are you know, do you have the skills for the job?

279
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,210
Speaker 0: It's like oh you can't be a programmer unless you have programming skills.

280
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,910
Speaker 1: What if one of those skills is willing to take Adderall, right?

281
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:49,864
Speaker 0: You know willing and you know able are different right?

282
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:50,586
Speaker 1: Well, you're able.

283
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,550
Speaker 1: you just aren't willing.

284
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,797
Speaker 0: That's you know, there's a lot of questions there.

285
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:55,881
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are a lot of questions.

286
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:59,476
Speaker 1: Maybe this is gonna be a fascinating panel We're running at packs.

287
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,043
Speaker 0: Anyway, this is just.

288
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:05,790
Speaker 0: you know, this is just the first instance I've seen of just someone coming out and admitting what everyone already knew.

289
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:09,003
Speaker 1: Well, they do they admit it but not for Adderall.

290
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,430
Speaker 1: It was always one step below that.

291
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,609
Speaker 1: It was like the energy drinks in the caffeine and the guarana and all that shit.

292
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,718
Speaker 1: This is like a step up.

293
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:20,882
Speaker 1: right, you know There's cocaine and amphetamines going on - you know every there.

294
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:23,089
Speaker 0: anything that can help anyone is being used.

295
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:28,717
Speaker 1: But at the same time I get the impression a lot of things that don't help or in fact Actively hurt are being used as well.

296
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:32,510
Speaker 1: I don't think marijuana really makes you better at counter-strike.

297
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:35,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I doubt it does.

298
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:47,370
Speaker 0: Yeah But you know, it would be interesting right for like a you know, especially for things like, you know Due to his vaping right is a mild stimulant like, you know regular old e-cigs really gonna help you that much?

299
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:59,510
Speaker 0: Maybe not right, but if there's such a serious competition and say somebody is you know Like addicted to that and your answer to that is like anyone who's competing during the course of the tournament.

300
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,495
Speaker 0: We're gonna lock you in.

301
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,364
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the reverse barrier to entry of up.

302
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:05,758
Speaker 1: Sorry, you're addicted to cigarettes So now you can't compete in eSports, right?

303
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,207
Speaker 0: It's like you're you know, that's part of the thing right.

304
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:12,450
Speaker 0: when you go black dynamite I'm addicted to steroids and cocaine like when you're in the Olympics, right?

305
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,098
Speaker 0: Not only do they test you but it's like they're.

306
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:16,510
Speaker 0: you know, they're keeping you in that Olympic village and shit.

307
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:23,284
Speaker 0: You can't go screwing around Inside the village, you know, so there's another similar story sex.

308
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:25,309
Speaker 0: Apparently Olympic Village is so much sex going on.

309
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,870
Speaker 0: So because it's all hot people from around the world who are relatively young and also I thought I was gonna bring that up.

310
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,145
Speaker 1: I was gonna I was gonna make that's like the sex fiesta of the world.

311
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:36,410
Speaker 0: is the Olympic Village?

312
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:39,205
Speaker 1: Make an oblique reference to that and then turn it into a joke.

313
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:40,954
Speaker 1: and you were just like, oh, yeah You know, it's a sex village.

314
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:42,379
Speaker 0: It is pretty much everything.

315
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,890
Speaker 0: I've heard is the Olympic Village is like the sexiest place.

316
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:57,965
Speaker 1: so at Evo 2015 fighting game tournament happening Street Fighter 4 dudes controller broke in the middle of it and The story around this is pretty interesting, but it's a finals.

317
00:18:57,985 --> 00:18:58,970
Speaker 0: First of all, it's a big deal.

318
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,500
Speaker 1: This is a big deal, but you can read the story.

319
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,647
Speaker 1: We don't report news on geek nights.

320
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:05,550
Speaker 1: We just comment on it.

321
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:16,250
Speaker 1: What we want I want to talk about is that the rules that they had they had rules about this about what to do with The right, you know Evo is like a legit thing that's been going on for a long time.

322
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:20,150
Speaker 0: It's like they're not amateur hour when it comes to this kind of situation.

323
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:25,204
Speaker 1: So here are the rules on equipment failure in a tournament at Evo.

324
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:29,788
Speaker 0: Okay reporting equipment failure I mean the fact that they have these rules shows it's not amateur hour.

325
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:30,974
Speaker 1: Yep I mean and like.

326
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:37,069
Speaker 1: this is another example of this area this arena this Genre of gaming is maturing.

327
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:40,420
Speaker 1: video game hardware has the tendency to break down during tournaments.

328
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:45,390
Speaker 1: buttons or joysticks will occasionally break down in the middle of a match leaving a Player on the broken side at a significant disadvantage.

329
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:52,614
Speaker 1: The following rules will be used in the event of a break breakdown one in the event of an equipment player Failure.

330
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:55,530
Speaker 1: the player has the out there a lot of typos in this.

331
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,171
Speaker 1: I apologize.

332
00:19:56,492 --> 00:20:00,960
Speaker 1: the player has the option to stop the game in progress and obtain a replacement.

333
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,520
Speaker 1: if The game is stopped in progress the reporting player must forfeit the current rounds.

334
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:10,332
Speaker 1: New equipment must immediately be available.

335
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:12,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure the pros are bringing multiple joy.

336
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,348
Speaker 1: It doesn't say who is responsible for that.

337
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:17,180
Speaker 1: That's something the end of the NHL pros are the pros.

338
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,928
Speaker 1: They're not showing up with one fight I know but I'm saying the NHL rules have things like the sticks are provided in this Capacity the pucks.

339
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:28,347
Speaker 0: your equipment manager takes care of it But it's all in the rules.

340
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:34,096
Speaker 0: if you're if you're so pro at Street Fighter that that is your job Because that's how good you have to be to make it to these finals.

341
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:38,540
Speaker 0: and at Evo You've got probably a person who's carrying a joysticks around.

342
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:39,723
Speaker 1: But what it's just.

343
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:46,460
Speaker 1: it's interesting to point out that this equivalent section in ice hockey rules is like four times longer.

344
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,146
Speaker 1: sure New equipment must be immediately available.

345
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:53,515
Speaker 1: if replacement equipment cannot be obtained in a timely manner you lose.

346
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:58,586
Speaker 1: the player must continue to play on their current equipment or Forfeit the match.

347
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,917
Speaker 0: Well, if your thing is just completely broken doesn't do anything.

348
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:04,932
Speaker 1: You're just gonna lose The entire match not around.

349
00:21:05,152 --> 00:21:21,213
Speaker 1: sure once replacement equipment is obtained the player is given the rest of that round to configure their buttons and test the new equipment if The player gains an undue advantage by doing so Exempli a gratis charging an abundance of super meter.

350
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:23,100
Speaker 1: They must forfeit that game.

351
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:29,420
Speaker 1: Mmm that rule is good, but has too much ambiguity.

352
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:33,654
Speaker 1: It says charging an abundance of super meters.

353
00:21:33,754 --> 00:21:34,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, let me charge a little bit.

354
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,832
Speaker 0: It's if you charge any super meter at all.

355
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,039
Speaker 0: Why is that fair?

356
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, now maybe charge it a little bit is kind of like stepping a little bit past the base.

357
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:47,448
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, just push it a little bit kind of like in hockey Like yeah, if you drop your stick Well, fuck you.

358
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:48,639
Speaker 1: like you can try to pick it up.

359
00:21:49,103 --> 00:21:51,180
Speaker 1: If you break your stick, well, you gotta go get a new one.

360
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,619
Speaker 1: You don't get another person on the ice while you're doing that.

361
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:59,700
Speaker 1: So Oh a player may opt to switch out equipment between games with no penalty.

362
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,002
Speaker 1: Yeah This occurs.

363
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:05,740
Speaker 1: the player will be given ample time to configure his buttons before the game begins.

364
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:10,557
Speaker 1: Not super fan of the gendered language, even though that's technically correct, but whatever whatever.

365
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:11,520
Speaker 0: but yeah.

366
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:15,655
Speaker 0: So they but they have a rule for the situation and the situation happened.

367
00:22:15,996 --> 00:22:17,000
Speaker 0: So they followed the rule, right?

368
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:24,840
Speaker 1: Yep, they followed the rule and the story is that apparently The players thought that the fact that he had to forfeit was kind of bullshit.

369
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:29,370
Speaker 1: So they agreed to alternate procedures among themselves.

370
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:34,057
Speaker 0: So while that's I mean on paper, that's kind of cool, right?

371
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:35,182
Speaker 0: It's like, okay That's at.

372
00:22:35,242 --> 00:22:38,373
Speaker 0: the thing that actually happened is probably a more satisfying thing, right?

373
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,669
Speaker 0: Someone didn't just get an automatic loss They actually played it out.

374
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:45,539
Speaker 0: They even like Right and they really restarted the thing.

375
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:54,780
Speaker 0: They let the timer run down to where the timer was when the breakage happened and they punched each other just enough to have as Much damage done to them as it was when the thing happened.

376
00:22:55,121 --> 00:23:01,289
Speaker 0: so it's like they picked up where they left off which is kind of much more satisfying for the Spectators and for the fairness of who wins right.

377
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:07,011
Speaker 0: if you just get an automatic loss because your controller broke That's kind of disappointing and not cool.

378
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:13,680
Speaker 0: So what happened was cooler, but You can't just have two players Deciding to use a different rule.

379
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,447
Speaker 0: You can't be like at the Super Bowl.

380
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:17,836
Speaker 0: at the start of the Super Bowl both coaches come out and they're like,

381
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,302
Speaker 1: yeah Ref,

382
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:24,956
Speaker 0: we both decided that during this Super Bowl touchdowns will be worth five points instead of the usual

383
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:34,003
Speaker 1: but at the same time Because these are eSports unlike human sports with just humans bumping into each other There are.

384
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:39,000
Speaker 1: there is a lot more capacity for rolling things back and doing alternate procedures.

385
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:45,178
Speaker 1: So that kind of interaction could be one of the hallmarks of some eSports in the future.

386
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:47,120
Speaker 0: that it yeah That would be a good thing, right?

387
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,786
Speaker 0: I mean the fact that you can Like at a football game.

388
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:54,936
Speaker 0: sometimes if there's like it's hard to roll back more than one play To redo something if something was mess.

389
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:57,740
Speaker 1: imagine I'm not saying the same but imagine an advanced wars tournament.

390
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:03,420
Speaker 1: You could theoretically roll back in turns if you needed to write like the net runner tournament.

391
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,326
Speaker 0: I was at some.

392
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:16,390
Speaker 0: something that happens a lot is Someone will like Accidentally leave their cards behind in the previous game and it'll get shuffled into their previous opponents deck and then they'll play a new game And then in the next round and missing some cards.

393
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,607
Speaker 0: and that's why you count your cards for every round to make sure you have Them all and you don't have any extras.

394
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:24,040
Speaker 0: and if you do have extras then you give them back, right?

395
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:33,200
Speaker 0: But it's like I've had seen people play games Missing cards in their deck and you know, we don't have rules yet because the company that makes netrunner sucks at this.

396
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:41,520
Speaker 0: But I've seen some judges say yeah You'll just have to replay that game since the game you played with while missing cards doesn't count and you just roll it back.

397
00:24:42,143 --> 00:24:51,000
Speaker 0: But you know in eSports the rolling back is much more possible Than in say baseball where you'd have to keep fans there for another two hours if you rolled back to say the fourth inning.

398
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:52,568
Speaker 0: You know, you can roll back.

399
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:54,477
Speaker 0: You can say up that last Street Fighter match didn't count.

400
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:54,920
Speaker 0: play it again.

401
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, this matters a lot.

402
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:57,366
Speaker 1: Remember the Omega.

403
00:24:57,406 --> 00:25:00,775
Speaker 0: you can say this Starcraft match fucked up at one minute.

404
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:02,540
Speaker 0: It's all recorded digitally.

405
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:06,095
Speaker 0: We'll just read roll the replay back to the one-minute mark.

406
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:07,200
Speaker 0: Ready set go.

407
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:10,388
Speaker 1: Remember the Omega thon finale at PAX East.

408
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:19,352
Speaker 1: that was the Nintendo World Championships redone and how the games failed Like more than halfway through the first go.

409
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,939
Speaker 1: so they had to start over and do it again.

410
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:28,269
Speaker 1: The team that was winning the first time was winning because they knew how to play fucking Mario one Yeah, the other team didn't.

411
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:33,133
Speaker 1: but because the other team Basically got that practice round and then they had to start over.

412
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:34,579
Speaker 1: the other team was able to win.

413
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:42,611
Speaker 1: They would definitely not have won if they'd played the original match all the way through But the original match was fouled by an equipment failure.

414
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:45,020
Speaker 1: Mmm, so these issues.

415
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:53,159
Speaker 0: While there are many more ways to roll back but in a professional competition Learning something from the practice match isn't gonna make a big difference.

416
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,650
Speaker 0: Yeah unless what it could.

417
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:05,620
Speaker 0: right if you're playing Street Fighter and Practice match and someone revealed their hidden card that they had been saving for the finals And then that match gets undone and they have to redo it again.

418
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,944
Speaker 0: But now, you know, they're hidden card.

419
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:08,849
Speaker 0: They better have another hidden card.

420
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:16,020
Speaker 1: Otherwise, yeah, or even what about just situations like What is the test of skill you'd always talk about in an ortho game?

421
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,566
Speaker 1: What is the thing that you're ostensibly testing?

422
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:24,420
Speaker 1: the omega-thon is ostensibly testing a combination of your skillet games and your knowledge of games.

423
00:26:25,022 --> 00:26:43,363
Speaker 1: So now that the people who had more knowledge of Mario 1 lost that Advantage because that knowledge was given to the other team in the restart anyway, eSports are both simpler and easier in the sense that you can do clever things with the rules and you can buck all the traditions that constrain a Lot of sports,

424
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:51,740
Speaker 0: but even though even the most pro level ones still are not Mature yet in terms of you know, I mean they're getting there rapidly.

425
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:57,999
Speaker 0: Evo is probably the top tier if there is a tier But it's still not as good as it needs to be yet.

426
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:02,540
Speaker 1: Also final note this stuff is gonna be big business down the road.

427
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:06,579
Speaker 1: So it's already big high school kids looking for careers in the future.

428
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,614
Speaker 1: eSports eSports stuff is actually a valid career path, right?

429
00:27:11,654 --> 00:27:17,431
Speaker 1: I mean like team managers You're basically all the jobs that like baseball and football have.

430
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:25,055
Speaker 0: you could be the equipment manager for someone who's really good at Starcraft And you're all like getting keyboards and mice and polishing them and shit.

431
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:29,614
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could be the commentator You could be the ref you could be the commissioner.

432
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:30,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, boo.

433
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:32,627
Speaker 0: And then they'll be talking about you.

434
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:33,350
Speaker 0: I'll be booing you.

435
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:38,700
Speaker 0: They'll be talking about you on ESPN, you know You could be the the trophy polisher, right?

436
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,763
Speaker 0: It's your job to manage.

437
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:45,640
Speaker 1: the Starcraft Hall of Fame is the one that the biggest thing that eSports lack is a Stanley Cup equivalent.

438
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:48,303
Speaker 1: Make it yeah There's got to be an.

439
00:27:48,724 --> 00:27:54,080
Speaker 0: make an overall eSports championship and make a trophy for it and then manage it in a Stanley Cup fashion.

440
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:55,565
Speaker 1: Well, you know we could do.

441
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:56,929
Speaker 1: we could do it the way they have to.

442
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:13,148
Speaker 0: they have to compete in the FPS the RTS the fighting game the turn-based strategy game of some sort boxing the actual sport and also the The What the classic arcade style game.

443
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:15,135
Speaker 1: so, you know we should do oh and pinball.

444
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:22,274
Speaker 1: the easy way to do that because you don't we don't have we don't own an NHL is You know, the Stanley Cup was a challenge cup for a long time.

445
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:26,580
Speaker 1: You make it a challenge cup You just officiate it and you set it up the way the Stanley Cup was.

446
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,574
Speaker 0: So we just we just award it to the best eSports person in North America.

447
00:28:31,674 --> 00:28:39,126
Speaker 1: every start using our own discretion Yes to start and then we basically just manage the rules of When and how it can be.

448
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:43,081
Speaker 0: we should go to the same place that Lord Stanley got the Stanley Cup from and buy a new Cup.

449
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:48,157
Speaker 0: Oh, so I'm sure a silver cup is expensive but affordable, especially if it's gonna last so long.

450
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:48,899
Speaker 0: It's probably worth it.

451
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:50,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, what can a silver cup be?

452
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,678
Speaker 0: a few thousand dollars?

453
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:54,985
Speaker 0: Might even only be hundreds of dollars.

454
00:28:55,026 --> 00:29:00,020
Speaker 1: silver isn't what we have to make the original that we keep ourselves for the museum piece.

455
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:03,260
Speaker 0: No, you know you get the use like the Stanley Cup.

456
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,312
Speaker 0: They used that first one for quite a while until it got big.

457
00:29:06,774 --> 00:29:07,557
Speaker 0: then they did something.

458
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:08,320
Speaker 0: then they made more.

459
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:10,959
Speaker 0: If it never becomes big, why would he buy two cups?

460
00:29:12,462 --> 00:29:20,948
Speaker 0: One failed cup we can have so anyway.

461
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:27,495
Speaker 1: things of the day Crash bandicoot games were not that good.

462
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:30,765
Speaker 0: Like they're not There's 3d platform ease.

463
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:31,749
Speaker 0: I never cared.

464
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:32,772
Speaker 1: I mean, I've never really.

465
00:29:33,193 --> 00:29:35,783
Speaker 1: they're very few of those games that I like Pretty much.

466
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:37,895
Speaker 0: you played Mario 64 and you really like it.

467
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:41,504
Speaker 0: you can play Mario Sunshines or galaxies and whatever.

468
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:43,567
Speaker 0: and then what do you need more of those for?

469
00:29:43,948 --> 00:30:02,800
Speaker 1: but crash bandicoot exists and Very recently as in days ago their cutscenes That were for the first game Animated ones that were never actually used that had surfaced Occasionally and people seem to think they were from a an aborted cartoon.

470
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:15,176
Speaker 1: But no, these were just lost cutscenes that weren't included in the game and Someone found them got permission from the producer of the game and put them on YouTube days ago.

471
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:15,697
Speaker 0: I like.

472
00:30:15,837 --> 00:30:22,041
Speaker 0: I don't know Really it much about crash bandicoot at all But like the big very beginning of this looks very familiar Like.

473
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:24,389
Speaker 0: I feel like I've seen that background before.

474
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:26,296
Speaker 1: yeah, because that stuff is in the game.

475
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:27,379
Speaker 0: I never played the game.

476
00:30:27,862 --> 00:30:29,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you might have bumped into.

477
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:30,599
Speaker 0: I feel like I've seen that guy.

478
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,360
Speaker 0: Those some of those characters are vaguely familiar, but the background is really familiar.

479
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:41,512
Speaker 0: I feel like this is reusing animation cells or backgrounds from something else that I've seen before Because I definitely haven't seen this before.

480
00:30:41,552 --> 00:30:42,659
Speaker 0: that's not possible, right?

481
00:30:43,561 --> 00:30:48,580
Speaker 1: So so, uh, yeah, you're really into furry adjacent properties like Sonic.

482
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:52,477
Speaker 1: Here's the beach here of that a never before seen footage.

483
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:52,980
Speaker 1: Okay?

484
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:56,499
Speaker 0: so, you know, we love to talk on geek nights about.

485
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:01,996
Speaker 0: You know shit like making guns with your 3d printer, yeah, we do.

486
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:03,040
Speaker 0: here's a dude.

487
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:05,391
Speaker 0: I don't know who this is or what they do.

488
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:08,543
Speaker 1: the feds do because there's been a lot of Talk to him.

489
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,346
Speaker 0: They got it.

490
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:14,200
Speaker 0: They got a gun a real gun like a handgun the kind that can kill somebody.

491
00:31:14,845 --> 00:31:29,905
Speaker 0: They attached it with a stick To a drone with propellers on it and he arranged it such that it would fly Fire the gun and then the recoil would sort of push into the drone but the drone wouldn't crash or anything.

492
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:34,658
Speaker 1: drone is surprisingly capable of handling that recoil and it can shoot.

493
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:38,535
Speaker 0: so You can just fly this drone and then shoot someone with it.

494
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:39,620
Speaker 0: It's possible.

495
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,366
Speaker 0: Welcome to the year 2015.

496
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:42,587
Speaker 0: Yep.

497
00:31:42,687 --> 00:31:49,449
Speaker 1: I posit that within a year or two Someone's gonna be murdered in the u.s.

498
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,437
Speaker 1: By another civilian with a drone.

499
00:31:51,457 --> 00:32:06,179
Speaker 0: I don't say a year or two I say five years because someone who is smart enough and capable of setting up the gun on drone is Someone who is smart enough to have a job and have a good life and be whatnot.

500
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:11,854
Speaker 1: Engineers were evil the world would collapse such that they won't be murdering anybody.

501
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:25,919
Speaker 1: But what if Someone like defense distributed got a little cough going on there Lingering for like days decides to make the 3d printed gun that Automatically works that connects to your 3d printed drone?

502
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,184
Speaker 0: You have to be you have to.

503
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,439
Speaker 0: it won't happen until this is so accessible until the self kitty.

504
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:35,020
Speaker 0: once Florida man can do this then there will be a big problem.

505
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,134
Speaker 0: but until then it's just gonna be this awesome thing that we can talk about academically.

506
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:48,740
Speaker 1: cuz I'm gonna say if I if I were Like evil or there was someone I really needed to kill a drone like that Just fly up to their window and shoot them through their window and that would be the end of it.

507
00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:53,260
Speaker 0: if there was something I really needed to kill I would pay someone to run them over with their car in New York City.

508
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,867
Speaker 0: cuz You basically don't get punished for that at all.

509
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:55,489
Speaker 0: It's an accident.

510
00:32:55,992 --> 00:32:57,739
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but why would I want to kill someone in New York?

511
00:32:58,901 --> 00:32:59,770
Speaker 0: Maybe they're visiting.

512
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:00,396
Speaker 0: it's possible.

513
00:33:01,424 --> 00:33:06,225
Speaker 1: It is possible, you know evil dictator visiting the UN Something like that in a moment.

514
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:08,895
Speaker 1: The book club book is still not water ship down.

515
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:10,380
Speaker 1: Scott did upset to update the website.

518
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:20,757
Speaker 0: I'm a little over 25% through.

519
00:33:20,777 --> 00:33:21,600

00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,900
Speaker 0: They are in the city that they got to.

524
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:29,488
Speaker 0: They're like, oh my god, it's a city.

525
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,240
Speaker 1: You mean like barrel out of the share line, whatever.

526
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,550
Speaker 1: They're not in the city city or the city city city.

527
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,198
Speaker 0: No, they're the first the first city they've ever seen.

00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:40,555
Speaker 1: Okay, you've.

530
00:33:40,696 --> 00:33:45,337
Speaker 1: uh This is gonna be another situation where I finished the book and then like a year later we do the show.

531
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:45,920
Speaker 0: this book is big.

532
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,493
Speaker 0: Yo, yeah, and it's not that I don't I read slow.

533
00:33:48,513 --> 00:33:49,920
Speaker 0: I'm actually read way fast.

534
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:50,483
Speaker 0: I just don't.

535
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:53,340
Speaker 0: I go home and I watch something else instead of reading.

536
00:33:53,822 --> 00:34:02,259
Speaker 0: I've been reading but what I've been to my new thing is that since my iPad died actually You know, I used to when I go to bed I would you know iPad until I went to sleep.

537
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:15,083
Speaker 0: But now since my iPad is gone and not getting a new one till it comes out Hopefully iPad Pro comes out and that's not just a rumor You know, I've been reading only books and comics before going to bed instead of Ipad.

538
00:34:15,163 --> 00:34:17,335
Speaker 1: Oh books say yeah books like that book.

539
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:18,020
Speaker 0: Yeah that book.

540
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,400
Speaker 1: Okay, as long as you're reading that book already yesterday because I'm not that excited about finishing this book.

541
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:26,179
Speaker 1: So I don't want to be in a situation where I have to wait.

542
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,840
Speaker 0: You can just read any book you want while waiting.

543
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:31,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is well with some of these books.

544
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:33,608
Speaker 1: if I read a bunch of books I'll forget.

545
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:39,179
Speaker 0: my nuanced points Shows how that tells people that the book may be forgettable or unforgettable.

546
00:34:39,562 --> 00:34:45,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also like the prince of nothing like I got to read it again Run a regular basis to be able to talk about it.

547
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:46,456

588
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:43,056
Speaker 1: we actually have people Representing a wide range of games and game design, right?

00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,260
Speaker 0: You've got us two jerks.

590
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,142

597
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:05,208
Speaker 1: I tried to get someone from oculus on this panel because that would have been the only thing we didn't have The closes we've got.

598
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:07,136
Speaker 0: I guess you also don't have triple-a game developer.

601
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:16,691

602
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:19,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, that's probably the same reason Andrew isn't on either.

603
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, no Andrew is also just afraid of saying something stupid.

604

00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:20,286
Speaker 0: That's not the first time they've been.

644
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:22,760
Speaker 1: I wonder if they'll go back to Vegas cuz they're the venue they were at.

645
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,246
Speaker 0: I don't think they're leaving Vegas.

646
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:26,474
Speaker 0: They're just temporarily doing a Broadway show.

647
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:28,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, that show in Vegas I don't think ever ends.

648
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,261
Speaker 1: the thing is Contract.

649
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:35,595
Speaker 1: if I were them like that resort like the place they play live in Vegas.

650
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:44,200
Speaker 1: I know but the place they perform Kind of Crappy and old-school compared to modern Vegas isn't every place they in Vegas like that.

651
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:56,583
Speaker 1: No, all the places on the new like main strip are Super modern kind of scary how well-designed they are and the place that pen and tell her at just feels really dumpy in like early 90s styling Whatever.

652
00:39:56,764 --> 00:40:00,980
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, so I will be doing that lecture on September 2nd, and you should totally come see it.

Speaker 1: We will likely a video of it.

654
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:06,059

00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,786
Speaker 1: I will link to this and we'll go from there.

662
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:24,218
Speaker 1: All right, so we had a 4th of July party and We as always were playing a bunch of games with a bunch of friends at it.

663
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:30,800
Speaker 1: When you have a lot of friends over there aren't a lot of games that a lot of people can play except party games.

664
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:35,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, the old, you know apples to apples cards against humanity comes out.

665
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,874
Speaker 1: Yep, and you know what those games have to play.

666
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,357
Speaker 0: spot it.

667
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:48,032
Speaker 1: But the our go-to our go-to for this party that worked out real well was mount your friends a gift from the hitman heart That has gotten a lot of play and I'm

668
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,989
Speaker 0: I don't feel like I'm good at that game But every time I play it I do really fucking well.

669
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:55,802
Speaker 0: you do really fucking well, but in the end and he doesn't matter I'm pretty good.

670
00:40:55,843 --> 00:40:56,204
Speaker 0: I won.

671
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:57,749
Speaker 1: I won that one that one.

672
00:40:57,909 --> 00:40:59,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the biggest one we'd ever played.

673
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:01,000
Speaker 0: one previous ones.

674
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,569
Speaker 1: Do you have one previous ones?

675
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,200
Speaker 1: I will give you that you were good at this game.

676
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:06,250
Speaker 1: And it's not the duck hunt.

677
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,415
Speaker 0: It's like assembly programming.

678
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:08,300
Speaker 0: It's like in my mind.

679
00:41:08,862 --> 00:41:10,228
Speaker 0: I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

680
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:21,320
Speaker 1: But when I go to do it somehow it's like oh It's interesting seeing which of our friends are good at it Which of our friends are not because it's not the people you'd expect be good or not good at it.

681
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:23,420
Speaker 0: No, it's like someone to be like the master of fighting games.

682
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,899
Speaker 0: It's like whoa, they're so good at video games and you play mount your friends and it's like dirt.

683
00:41:27,563 --> 00:41:30,840
Speaker 1: But then so Conrad and Joe were like, whoa, you should install jackbox games.

684
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,215
Speaker 1: I was like what like you don't know jack like those old games shit from the 90s.

685
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:39,191
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was like, yeah There's a thing on steam just install it.

686
00:41:39,532 --> 00:41:41,300
Speaker 0: So rim you'd never played any of these ever before.

687
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:55,155
Speaker 1: I've always known about you don't know jack and I just never gave a shit because I Had my fill of party trivia quizy kinds of games Like when I was a little kid and in high school when these were popular.

688
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:58,337
Speaker 1: I was in quiz ball I had I was doing that like in a

689
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:12,478
Speaker 0: Thing with you don't know Jack is I played it in the 90s and we would sit around someone's computer Right with with like a 14-inch monitor and we all you everyone have like a button on the keyboard that's their button for ringing in or whatever and stuff like that.

690
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:17,099
Speaker 0: and Even though it was sort of like it was like a really trivia party game.

691
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:22,680
Speaker 0: But the things that made it kind of more awesome were that it wasn't just straight-up trivia like Trivial Pursuit.

692
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:25,920
Speaker 0: It was clever trivia and really interesting trivia.

693
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,120
Speaker 0: so even though if you weren't winning or whatever you were either learning or Being fascinated and it wasn't really a lot of internet in those days if there was any at all as AOL days.

694
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:44,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, you know, it's like you could you know a cat picture like oh my god Not that I had cat pictures in it and You know, it was sudden.

695
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:45,940
Speaker 0: you could play in that party atmosphere.

696
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:52,520
Speaker 0: But also this the polish of the game itself graphics and sound wise with the narrator with his cover.

697
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,116
Speaker 0: I think they have the same narrators even since the old days even in this new one.

698
00:42:57,156 --> 00:42:59,043
Speaker 0: I think it's the same person It sounds the same.

699
00:42:59,124 --> 00:43:07,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like just the way they talk and you know The whole presentation of it really makes you feel like you're on a professional game.

700
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,039
Speaker 0: show it.

701
00:43:08,341 --> 00:43:17,731
Speaker 0: You know if you can't actually go on the Family Feud, but if you can get your whole family to play You don't know jack game together You're basically you feel like you're on the real double.

702
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:18,593
Speaker 0: dare something at home?

703
00:43:18,614 --> 00:43:23,332
Speaker 1: double dare can't do so Way back to kind of frame all of this.

704
00:43:23,432 --> 00:43:24,778
Speaker 1: why we're talking about this?

705
00:43:24,798 --> 00:43:26,402
Speaker 1: is We?

706
00:43:26,463 --> 00:43:34,113
Speaker 1: what we had said was that the GameCube was like the height of Nintendo's Interesting innovation in that they had that Game Boy link cable.

707
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,579
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and that they underused.

708
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:48,388
Speaker 0: Yes They only use everything that they've invented except the only things they haven't underused are the concept of a portable console the touchscreen the analog stick and The two screens of the DS.

709
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:50,195
Speaker 0: that's the only things they haven't underused.

710
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:55,852
Speaker 0: everything else they've invented They've underused so I guess also the button and the d-pad.

711
00:43:56,073 --> 00:44:06,476
Speaker 1: that was that was an idea that they never capitalized on other than Final Fantasy crystal chronicles and Or swords and for source and verse and pac-man verse three only three games three kinds.

712
00:44:06,837 --> 00:44:09,947
Speaker 1: quite a right So they never.

713
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:13,263
Speaker 1: you know, the DS should be able to connect to the Wii and do that But it just fucking doesn't.

714
00:44:13,323 --> 00:44:14,527
Speaker 1: and they've never done any of this.

715
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:23,175
Speaker 0: and I gave up even just make fucking poker where it's Texas Hold them on the TV is the table and in your 3ds in your hand.

716
00:44:23,195 --> 00:44:24,440
Speaker 0: You can see your hand.

717
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:33,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's even just that just straight-up poker that any card game You're bugging, you know, the concert just but user.

718
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:42,667
Speaker 1: the concept of everyone having their own screen That they can see is a killer app for like Thousands of game ideas.

719
00:44:43,149 --> 00:44:46,080
Speaker 0: Yep, and there's all these game ideas are completely untapped.

720
00:44:46,180 --> 00:45:27,033
Speaker 0: so I've known for a while being a you know programmer that is technologically feasible to either have a server running somewhere a web server is you could use it not web server also or Something running on an HD PC doesn't really matter and then Everyone on their phone or laptop or tablet Connecting such that you could do the same kind of game where on your TV communal screen is one thing and on everyone's individual device is their personal hidden information and you can make games like this, but I've never seen anyone do it or Do it well Until now.

721
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:29,939
Speaker 1: Yep So we've seen people do like SMS or whatever.

722
00:45:30,502 --> 00:45:36,100
Speaker 1: This thing just fucking worked to the to a point that I was pretty intoxicated because it was a big party.

723
00:45:36,505 --> 00:45:50,939
Speaker 1: So I like install this game I'm gonna play it and I just sort of hit go and not only did it just work But it just worked requiring eight people to individually go to their phone and do a bunch of shit, right?

724
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:57,154
Speaker 0: So Technologically, it's I'm pretty sure this is how it works is you run the application.

725
00:45:57,194 --> 00:45:59,420
Speaker 0: It's actually a local Windows app.

726
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:05,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a game right in Steam But you can actually just run the app on someone's phone to get it from the App Store or something.

727
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,484
Speaker 0: So you run this app.

728
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:08,653
Speaker 0: the app connects to the server.

729
00:46:08,673 --> 00:46:10,079
Speaker 0: that's in the cloud somewhere, right?

730
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:15,160
Speaker 0: So you have really, you know, and it's connecting with like this one API.

731
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:21,180
Speaker 0: So it gets the information that needs to be public Meanwhile on the server in the cloud.

732
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:24,860
Speaker 0: So like when they're when this game could disappear one day if they take their server down.

733
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:33,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, because my steam server my steam game will go to the server and say I need a new game Right, and then the server gives it like here's the code for your game right now.

734
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:42,440
Speaker 0: Yeah so you go on your phone and go to the website and You type in the code and then it knows aha this person typed in this code.

735
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:46,820
Speaker 0: They belong to this game And so that's how everyone joins the game as they type in the shared code.

736
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:49,551
Speaker 1: But we're even everyone communicates with this server.

737
00:46:49,591 --> 00:46:53,831
Speaker 0: that synchronizes everyone and uses web sockets Yep to communicate with all your devices.

738
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:55,780
Speaker 1: that is key because it's web sockets.

739
00:46:56,241 --> 00:47:02,160
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just live like you're just connected to a web socket is basically a way to trick a web browser.

740
00:47:02,562 --> 00:47:06,340
Speaker 0: Not trick it but the way to make a web browser have a TCP IP connection.

741
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,167
Speaker 0: You can just send data across arbitrarily.

742
00:47:08,307 --> 00:47:10,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, you can just play quake over a web socket.

743
00:47:10,877 --> 00:47:11,218
Speaker 0: Whatever.

744
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,353
Speaker 1: Yep So it's what got me was that it just worked.

745
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:24,036
Speaker 1: It was super responsive Like way like real-time like I put in an answer and the screens immediately makes the noise or whatever.

746
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:24,457
Speaker 1: like it was.

747
00:47:24,798 --> 00:47:25,340
Speaker 0: it was fast.

748
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:29,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it worked it helped that everyone was on the same Wi-Fi with files But I wasn't.

749
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:31,031
Speaker 1: most people were not connected to the wire.

750
00:47:31,051 --> 00:47:32,196
Speaker 0: You're using your phone phone.

751
00:47:32,256 --> 00:47:33,120
Speaker 1: I was using my phone phone.

752
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:33,622
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

753
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:37,500
Speaker 1: Also, we had just changed the Wi-Fi password because the router had just caught fire.

754
00:47:38,082 --> 00:47:40,711
Speaker 1: So a lot of people were not connected to the Wi-Fi didn't matter.

755
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:41,333
Speaker 1: totally worked fine.

756
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:42,056
Speaker 0: I was on the Wi-Fi.

757
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:45,914
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it was really amazing.

758
00:47:45,935 --> 00:47:54,386
Speaker 1: and Basically, if you have friends who come over and everyone people have smartphones or literally any device with a web browser Yeah, any tablet will work.

759
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:54,707
Speaker 1: fine.

760
00:47:54,868 --> 00:48:00,189
Speaker 1: anything with a web browser that has an internet connection It has to be a web browser that does support web sockets.

761
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:08,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think someone had an old phone and it actually said on their screen Sorry, your browser doesn't support website, but I don't think you can use like the 3ds browser.

762
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,090
Speaker 0: There is also a 3ds has a web browser.

763
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,154
Speaker 1: There's also an app.

764
00:48:12,194 --> 00:48:13,480
Speaker 1: So I think you could use the app even.

765
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I saw the app in the App Store.

766
00:48:15,841 --> 00:48:18,080
Speaker 0: I think you can use the app to actually run the game.

767
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:24,319
Speaker 0: So you could like install the app on an iPad use the iPad as the communal device and then everyone sits around the iPad with their phones.

768
00:48:25,642 --> 00:48:29,100
Speaker 0: Or you can use the video out from the iPad to the TV or who knows what right?

769
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,399
Speaker 0: Or send the screen of the iPad to the TV with an Apple TV.

770
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:35,426
Speaker 1: So the games it has.

771
00:48:35,607 --> 00:48:37,974
Speaker 1: it doesn't have a lot in it, but it has only play.

772
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:39,880
Speaker 0: so we browse through the games.

773
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,800
Speaker 0: But we only played two of them that were recommended and that supported eight players.

774
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:47,303
Speaker 0: Some of the other ones don't support so it's got regular old You don't know Jack?

775
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:51,259
Speaker 1: the same thing that's existed since I was a little kid up to four players.

776
00:48:52,482 --> 00:48:59,927
Speaker 1: The three that are two that are up to eight players Which is like the sweet spot for this game because eight people is a good number of people to play a game at a party Like this.

777
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:02,511
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Fibbage, which is the lion game.

778
00:49:02,894 --> 00:49:03,940
Speaker 0: So as we played that one

779
00:49:04,522 --> 00:49:05,444
Speaker 1: Drawful which is

780
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:05,765
Speaker 0: played

781
00:49:05,785 --> 00:49:06,949
Speaker 1: on a dictionary basically

782
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:07,450
Speaker 0: that too

783
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:10,459
Speaker 1: and then word spud, which is basically just the match game

784
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:10,941
Speaker 0: Mmm,

785
00:49:11,603 --> 00:49:20,319
Speaker 1: and then the last one which takes up to a hundred players looks like a light version of the fibbage one lice water, okay, it's a bit because you know.

786
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,240
Speaker 1: Realistically, yeah, these games could have large numbers of players.

787
00:49:25,603 --> 00:49:33,640
Speaker 1: practically, you've got to Minimize the interaction and minimize how much the game blocks on someone not taking their turn quickly.

788
00:49:34,283 --> 00:49:36,616
Speaker 1: That's why only one of the game supports 100 players.

789
00:49:37,903 --> 00:49:38,607
Speaker 0: So fibbage.

790
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,260
Speaker 0: the way fibbage works is it shows a sentence on the screen?

791
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:47,199
Speaker 0: Like with a question or a sentence with a blank in it or whatever and everyone lies and makes up an answer.

792
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:55,900
Speaker 0: you make up an answer that you want people to Believe is the right answer But you don't want it to be the right answer.

793
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,466
Speaker 0: It has to be a false answer.

794
00:49:57,607 --> 00:50:05,700
Speaker 0: then after everyone has submitted their false answers By the way, if you type in the right answer, it will tell you that you're right and make you type something else.

795
00:50:07,141 --> 00:50:12,759
Speaker 0: Then it will show all of the answers that people submitted as well as the real answer.

796
00:50:13,061 --> 00:50:13,545
Speaker 0: Protip.

797
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:15,680
Speaker 1: if you can't spell you're never gonna win this game.

798
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,282
Speaker 1: Do you have to?

799
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:21,859
Speaker 0: so so from the get-go regardless of being clever and I'm coming up with something good to type in.

800
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:34,200
Speaker 0: You want to a type something in in a way that looks like the way the game would phrase the answer Right and spell it properly and punctuate it the way the game does so it fits in with the other answer.

801
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,659
Speaker 0: Is it like if you use camel case or you know?

802
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,732
Speaker 0: Do something weird or use a word that probably the game wouldn't use?

803
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:44,662
Speaker 0: it sort of stands out and people like that's obviously not The right answer.

804
00:50:45,364 --> 00:50:47,329
Speaker 0: so then you choose which answer.

805
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,080
Speaker 0: once they're all displayed you choose which one you think is the correct answer.

806
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,932
Speaker 0: You might know the correct answer because you typed it in in the first place.

807
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:55,699
Speaker 0: But yeah, just choose that one.

808
00:50:56,664 --> 00:51:05,520
Speaker 0: Anyone who chooses the right answer gets a bunch of points and Anyone who has their false answer chosen by someone else gets a bunch of points.

809
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:13,684
Speaker 0: yep, straight-up party game and then you get score and then you just keep doing this and the points increase and the questions get crazier and Then someone wins.

810
00:51:13,784 --> 00:51:14,889
Speaker 1: Yep, and then the draw.

811
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:17,300
Speaker 1: the one is basically just Pictionary like.

812
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:33,499
Speaker 0: So it tells you to you know, tell one person to draw something So you draw it and then people try to guess what it is Right, it seemed yeah, but everyone's kind of drawn a picture and it comes down to.

813
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,871
Speaker 1: People can't draw like no one can draw.

814
00:51:36,932 --> 00:51:38,980
Speaker 1: None of our friends can draw especially not on your iPhone.

815
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, like even the artist.

816
00:51:40,188 --> 00:51:41,900
Speaker 0: and it doesn't doesn't let you erase either.

817
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:47,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, so even the artists who normally like in a real-world Pictionary situation would be great.

818
00:51:48,245 --> 00:51:52,571
Speaker 1: They were severely Constrained by the way this you get one color.

819
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,039
Speaker 0: Everyone has their own color to draw in.

820
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:58,060
Speaker 0: Yep, and the things it gives you to draw I had the worst possible.

821
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,169
Speaker 0: I the first like the concept of hope.

822
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,540
Speaker 0: the first thing it told me to draw was family values.

823
00:52:03,363 --> 00:52:04,620
Speaker 0: And it's just like are you fucking kidding?

824
00:52:06,562 --> 00:52:08,070
Speaker 0: How am I supposed to draw family values?

825
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:13,460
Speaker 0: if you said family matters I go to draw on an Urkel But you said family values what the hell am I supposed to do?

826
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:21,564
Speaker 1: So the moral of all this I mean we don't need to review party games in depth is that this thing is Really legit.

827
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:25,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, the technology aspect of it is really what makes it happen.

828
00:52:25,377 --> 00:52:26,420
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a party game.

829
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:27,606
Speaker 0: It's a good party game.

830
00:52:27,988 --> 00:52:30,140
Speaker 0: You could you know, you could have this party game going on.

831
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:32,840
Speaker 0: Just you know, even without any technology.

832
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:38,414
Speaker 0: but having the Technology just made it so much easier for people to jump in if we brought this.

833
00:52:38,474 --> 00:52:42,769
Speaker 0: if he busted this out like as a board You know, it would be like an e-poop you cat.

834
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:45,036
Speaker 0: only some people go to it and some people don't.

835
00:52:45,377 --> 00:52:48,220
Speaker 0: the fact that it's on The TV it grabs the center of attention.

836
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:50,520
Speaker 0: People are sitting around on their phones.

837
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,530
Speaker 0: Suddenly you're sitting around on your phones together.

838
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,700
Speaker 0: that really brings everyone in no problem.

839
00:52:56,901 --> 00:53:01,416
Speaker 1: And the thing is it's the barest minimum effort once the technology is there.

840
00:53:01,496 --> 00:53:02,500
Speaker 0: the technology is there.

841
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:10,506
Speaker 0: I just I just learned how to do a really good pattern for writing a web socket Application the other day.

842
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:12,596
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a really great video.

843
00:53:13,118 --> 00:53:13,560
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

844
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,745
Speaker 0: So I can make these.

845
00:53:15,086 --> 00:53:18,319
Speaker 0: but here's I just need someone to do the front-end part to make it look nice.

846
00:53:18,882 --> 00:53:26,115
Speaker 1: The game design part of this like these games are so great The barest effort was put into the game design side.

847
00:53:26,155 --> 00:53:27,439
Speaker 1: That's not even the hard part.

848
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:36,285
Speaker 1: it amazes me that no one's really done this until now, so What I say to you out there Give up on Nintendo.

849
00:53:36,385 --> 00:53:41,000
Speaker 1: They have had the technology to do this on Nintendo consoles since the GameCube era.

850
00:53:41,402 --> 00:53:48,790
Speaker 1: They have squandered that they will never make use of multiple screens That all that multiple people are holding.

851
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,236
Speaker 1: ignore Nintendo.

852
00:53:50,296 --> 00:53:51,080
Speaker 1: give up on them.

853
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:54,972
Speaker 1: I mean Smash Brothers doesn't even work that well in local multiplayer.

854
00:53:54,992 --> 00:53:56,356
Speaker 0: You just make wizard with this.

855
00:53:56,777 --> 00:54:02,800
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah We should just make to prove the tech that we can make the technology happen as well.

856
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:05,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we should just as a proof of concept.

857
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:08,480
Speaker 1: and then all we have to do is sit down and design.

858
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,021
Speaker 1: You know you do.

859
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:15,760
Speaker 1: you design like ten games that are at least as designed as fibbage and drawful and BAM.

860
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:18,269
Speaker 1: You've just made something amazing.

861
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we try to make wizard for this.

862
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:23,217
Speaker 1: Yeah We should license that art.

863
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:28,980
Speaker 0: I'll just scan them in and use them and then in our in our proof of concept.

864
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,891
Speaker 1: Yeah, just to make it work.

865
00:54:29,952 --> 00:54:32,871
Speaker 0: and then you know If anyone wants to make it look nice, they can just replace all those.

866
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:35,503
