1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,452
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, October 11th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:14,960
Speaker 1: Tonight we talk about CITACON!

3
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:18,518
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,840
Speaker 0: So for the first time in like a month we had a thunderstorm.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,665
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was kind of weird today.

6
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:30,187
Speaker 1: how, you know, the weather wasn't all sunny like it's been the past couple days but I didn't feel bad.

7
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:33,520
Speaker 1: Usually when it's all gray, I'm like, uh, it's gray.

8
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:41,318
Speaker 1: And you get that sort of winter semi, you know, less happy than in the summer business going on.

9
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:44,937
Speaker 1: But I was pretty happy with the bad weather today.

10
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:45,359
Speaker 1: I don't know.

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,300
Speaker 0: See the thing is the winter around here doesn't bother me nearly as much as it did in Rochester.

12
00:00:50,364 --> 00:00:52,460
Speaker 0: Well, because it's sunny here in the winter.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,574
Speaker 0: Well, there'll be a foot of snow, but it'll be sunny.

14
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:56,580
Speaker 0: The sun will be out.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,340
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the cold bothers me, but today it was great.

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,084
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

17
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:03,220
Speaker 0: So the cold bothers you yet you get pissed off if the sun is out.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,740
Speaker 1: Well, because I don't like the brightness of the sun, but I like the warmth of the sun.

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,678
Speaker 0: What kind of fungus are you?

20
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:15,980
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was gray and dank, but I was kind of happy because it was a change of pace.

21
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,158
Speaker 1: You know, I like change.

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:26,900
Speaker 0: See, I like change, but when it comes to the weather, I would love it to be like 89 degrees dry and brutally sunny every single day.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,635
Speaker 1: Oh, just something about today's weather felt good.

24
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:30,320
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,080
Speaker 1: I bet you if the same weather was tomorrow, I probably wouldn't feel good about that.

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,614
Speaker 0: You know, the same weather is going to be tomorrow.

27
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:35,139
Speaker 0: In fact, worse.

28
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:38,180
Speaker 0: It's going to be rainy and miserable for the next couple days.

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, see rain, I like, I love rain when I'm inside.

30
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,440
Speaker 1: Rain is the best thing in the universe, and I'm outside, rain is the worst thing ever.

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,750
Speaker 0: See, I like rain outside.

32
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,860
Speaker 0: I like to go for walks in the rain.

33
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:48,159
Speaker 1: You go do that.

34
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:49,725
Speaker 0: I have in the past.

35
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:53,160
Speaker 0: In fact, I remember one time you locked me and Emily out of the house when we did so.

36
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:54,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah I did.

37
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:58,200
Speaker 1: You wanted to be in the rain, but then, oh, you wanted to be inside.

38
00:01:58,622 --> 00:01:59,840
Speaker 1: I thought you liked it in the rain.

39
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,620
Speaker 0: I did, and you know what, it wasn't raining anymore and we were done.

40
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:03,706
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

41
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:06,120
Speaker 1: Well, uh, yeah, you get what you deserve.

42
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,785
Speaker 0: Anyway, we got some news.

43
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:11,340
Speaker 0: Being Anime Manga Comics Day to all of you new Cinecon listeners.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we were at Cinecon this weekend, but while we were at Cinecon, there was another con going on in New Jersey called Manga Next.

45
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:26,480
Speaker 0: Which we kind of wanted to go to, and we might have gone for a, in fact, we probably would have gone for a day if Cinecon hadn't been, you know, awesome and went there instead.

46
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:32,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, uh, Manga Next is apparently the sister, brother, companion convention to Anime Next.

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,840
Speaker 1: It's in the same place, run by the same people, but it's manga instead of anime.

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,240
Speaker 0: Now, I don't know what the hell that's all about.

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,357
Speaker 1: I don't know, what do you do at a manga convention that's different from an anime convention?

50
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:43,920
Speaker 0: I don't know.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,560
Speaker 0: I mean, that's like having a video game convention and then a DDR convention.

52
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:53,853
Speaker 1: I mean, if it was Japan, there's enough manga where you could have a manga convention.

53
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:57,100
Speaker 1: that was a lot like, you know, a comic convention.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,659
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, here, most of the manga I like hasn't been released in the US.

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,840
Speaker 1: I know, right?

56
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,300
Speaker 0: Or has been released in such a limited quantity with no advertising that no one's ever heard of it.

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you could have a complete manga convention for me with like one table full of manga, and that would be all of it in the US.

58
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:18,119
Speaker 1: But anyway, there were two industry panels at this convention where they announced some stuff.

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:27,020
Speaker 1: Del Rey manga announced three new series, Kitchen Princess, Momote, Lollipop, and Shugochara.

60
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,800
Speaker 0: Alright, that last one doesn't have something weird in the name.

61
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,960
Speaker 1: Shugochara is by Peach Pit, who is the people who did Dearest and Rose and Maiden.

62
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,486
Speaker 0: God.

63
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,316
Speaker 0: Yeah.

64
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,957
Speaker 0: God.

65
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:42,700
Speaker 0: Dear, don't even get me started on that goddamn manga.

66
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:57,740
Speaker 1: In addition to the nine volumes of Genshiken that Del Rey will ultimately publish, you know, because they already published some of them here, there's going to be a Genshiken fan book, and there's going to be some Kuujibiki Unbalanced something something.

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,680
Speaker 0: I like Kuujibiki Unbalanced more than I like Genshiken.

68
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's going to be some Unbalanced action.

69
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:04,659
Speaker 0: I'm all about that.

70
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:11,880
Speaker 1: And also the famous Carl Horn, friend of Anime World Order and anime podcasts, you know, I think he works for Dark Horse.

71
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:19,760
Speaker 1: He says that Del Rey will be releasing an encyclopedia covering every manga that has been published in English.

72
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,460
Speaker 1: We'll see if that's true, because, you know, a guy from Dark Horse announces something about Del Rey.

73
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,937
Speaker 1: That's like Sony coming out of the press conference and being like, "Nintendo's coming out with this controller that you can move

74
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:31,379
Speaker 1: around.".

75
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:34,060
Speaker 1: So who knows if we can trust that.

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,760
Speaker 0: But yet at the same time, you stand to gain nothing by lying about another company.

77
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:39,690
Speaker 0: I mean...

78
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:42,138
Speaker 1: All you do is stand to lose when they sue you.

79
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,216
Speaker 0: Or worse, when they come out and say, "No, we're

80
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:45,598
Speaker 0: not.".

81
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:46,318
Speaker 1: Yeah.

82
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,057
Speaker 0: What the hell?

83
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:49,900
Speaker 1: But if there is such a thing, I will totally buy that.

84
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:51,180
Speaker 1: I'll have to see it first.

85
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:51,780
Speaker 0: In a second.

86
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if I saw it and it was good, I would get it.

87
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,299
Speaker 0: I'm curious to see if, you know, my sanctuary will be in there.

88
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:00,100
Speaker 1: Sure, it has to be, because it was a manga published in English.

89
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:04,719
Speaker 0: I'm sure they'll leave something out, and some fanboy will complain about it, and that fanboy might be me.

90
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:10,340
Speaker 1: Oh, and the other panel at the convention that was industry was Vertical.

91
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,760
Speaker 1: You might not have heard of Vertical, because they aren't a big manga publisher like, you know, Tokyo Pop and Viz and such.

92
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,300
Speaker 1: But they do publish Osamu Tezuka's works that aren't already published by Dark Horse and Viz.

93
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:24,659
Speaker 1: Mostly Buddha.

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,639
Speaker 1: They've already published eight hardcover volumes of Buddha, which is all of it.

95
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:32,460
Speaker 1: And they are now publishing the paperback versions, which is what I'm buying.

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,118
Speaker 1: I already have three of them, out of eight.

97
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,460
Speaker 1: And they are going to release, I've already preordered it, another Osamu Tezuka manga, Ode to Kirihito.

98
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,620
Speaker 1: Which is, I guess, awesome, because it's a Tezuka manga.

99
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:53,580
Speaker 1: And they are also going to add to their catalog all of Keiko Takamiya's works.

100
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:58,020
Speaker 1: First they're going to do Two Terra, which is three volumes.

101
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,960
Speaker 1: And then they're going to do some other stuff in the future.

102
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,519
Speaker 1: One they mentioned was Shounenai Song of Wind and Trees.

103
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,179
Speaker 0: Don't they call that a seminal Shounenai work?

104
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

105
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:15,560
Speaker 1: One that was visibly mentioned by name is the seminal Shounenai Song of Wind and Trees.

106
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:16,745
Speaker 0: Huh.

107
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:17,607
Speaker 0: Yeah.

108
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:18,350
Speaker 0: Yep.

109
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:19,280
Speaker 1: Yep.

110
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:21,298
Speaker 1: There you have it.

111
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:23,720
Speaker 1: One other thing, while we're talking about manga.

112
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:32,100
Speaker 1: In two months from now, December, you can preorder it now because you preorder comics and stuff, you know, from Diamond two months in advance.

113
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,620
Speaker 1: Dark Horse is putting out Gunsmith Cats Volume 1 Omnibus.

114
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:39,120
Speaker 0: Hot damn.

115
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:46,360
Speaker 1: It's 460-something pages, and if you preorder it from DCBService.com, it's eight bucks.

116
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,214
Speaker 1: If you buy it at the store, I think it might be 15, 20 bucks.

117
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:50,439
Speaker 0: I need a lot more Omnibuses.

118
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:56,060
Speaker 1: It's freaking a whole shit ton of Gunsmith Cats manga for not a lot of money.

119
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,239
Speaker 1: So either preorder it now or in December, go to the bookstore and buy it.

120
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,860
Speaker 0: See, I'm waiting for someone to re-release all of Urusei Atsara.

121
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,517
Speaker 0: I mean, my friend Ken had a whole thing.

122
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,700
Speaker 1: I would buy one volume of that, but I don't know if I'd buy all of it.

123
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:13,800
Speaker 0: I'd buy it all, because that show has a special place in my heart.

124
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,300
Speaker 1: There's got to be a lot of Urusei Atsara manga.

125
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:19,080
Speaker 0: There is a lot of that manga.

126
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,880
Speaker 1: There's a lot of long-running manga series, and I learned my lesson from One Piece.

127
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,170
Speaker 1: I probably don't want to buy them all.

128
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:27,519
Speaker 1: Just buy enough of it.

129
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:33,520
Speaker 0: The thing is, I read a lot of the manga, and it never really got old.

130
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,597
Speaker 0: It changed itself up more than Ranma, even to the point that it was usually always funny.

131
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:41,140
Speaker 1: You got news?

132
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got news.

133
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,239
Speaker 0: Real quick, little news.

134
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:47,160
Speaker 0: There's been all this talk about the trouble with the PS3 launch.

135
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:50,480
Speaker 0: Well, not really the launch, but the pre-launch, the pre-orders.

136
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,360
Speaker 0: Now, they sold out immediately, and now they're all on eBay, but eBay's shutting them down, but no one cares, and they're going to come back up, whatever.

137
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:01,240
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, Nintendo, which says they're going to have, what, like 9 million Wiis or something stupid?

138
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,640
Speaker 1: There's like a hajillion freaking Wiis going to be out there.

139
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,474
Speaker 1: If you want a Wii, you're going to get one, if you've got the dinero.

140
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,857
Speaker 0: So, the Nintendo store in New York City, in Manhattan, where Scott pre-ordered the Wii a while ago... Weeks ago.

141
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:17,360
Speaker 0: A while ago, yeah, has quietly started taking pre-orders again.

142
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like they took pre-orders from me and a whole bunch of other people, and then they stopped.

143
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:25,220
Speaker 1: And then they started taking them again without any announcement at all.

144
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also currently with no limit.

145
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:31,820
Speaker 0: And they haven't said how many they're going to allow to be taken before they stop, but...

146
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:34,715
Speaker 1: But a guy said... A guy on the street said...

147
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, well actually, apparently he asked the Nintendo store guy.

148
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,918
Speaker 1: An employee at the Nintendo store told the guy who told the internet who told us...

149
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Speaker 0: So, while it's total hearsay, I don't doubt this for a second, that currently more than a thousand have already been pre-ordered to be picked up...

150
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,408
Speaker 1: No, that's not what he said.

151
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:53,940
Speaker 1: That's not what he said at all.

152
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,760
Speaker 0: What was just cut out there was me showing Scott the website and proving that I was right and he was wrong.

153
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,838
Speaker 1: What do you want from me?

154
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:12,520
Speaker 0: They have indeed sold, as of press time of that article on Kotaku, more than one thousand Wii pre-orders at the Nintendo store, and there's no stopping in sight.

155
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,328
Speaker 1: How could they sell a thousand Wiis?

156
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:17,840
Speaker 1: I'm going to wait in line with a thousand people for Wiis.

157
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,180
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, you don't have to wait in line.

158
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,313
Speaker 1: How many Wiis are they going to have?

159
00:09:20,354 --> 00:09:20,860
Speaker 1: Two thousand?

160
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:21,959
Speaker 0: Probably more than that.

161
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,065
Speaker 1: I wonder, here's the thing though.

162
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:25,389
Speaker 1: They got a thousand Wiis.

163
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,780
Speaker 1: They better have a thousand Zelda Twilight Princesses there, or else.

164
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,066
Speaker 0: You know how many?

165
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:32,840
Speaker 0: They're probably going to print extra of everything, because it doesn't matter.

166
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,134
Speaker 1: I mean, they're going to need like eight thousand Wiimotes there.

167
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:38,760
Speaker 1: Where are they going to put all this shit?

168
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:41,004
Speaker 0: Uh, you know what?

169
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,389
Speaker 0: I'm sure they've got a contingency.

170
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,160
Speaker 0: I'll bet they've got a giant freaking warehouse somewhere in that building.

171
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,200
Speaker 1: They've got to have it somewhere in the basement or something, because goddamn, that's a lot of Wiimotes.

172
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, see, I'm torn now, because I want to go down to the Nintendo store for what might be the crazy launch.

173
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,480
Speaker 0: But at the same time, our friend's throwing a party out in Philly.

174
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, his party's on Saturday.

175
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,094
Speaker 1: The Wii launch is on Sunday.

176
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:04,800
Speaker 1: You can show up at any time on Sunday.

177
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,199
Speaker 1: I'm not going to go at midnight, even if Reggie's going to be there.

178
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,920
Speaker 0: What if Reggie and Miyamoto were going to be there, and they would fellate you?

179
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,439
Speaker 1: It would have to be something like that.

180
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:26,710
Speaker 0: Things of the day!

181
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,370
Speaker 1: We're going to replace you saying things of the day.

182
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,070
Speaker 0: With an echoey version of me saying things of the day.

183
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:36,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, but hopefully a recorded one, so you don't have to say it every day, and it'll sound better.

184
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:38,149
Speaker 0: I think it sounds fine the way it is for now.

185
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,090
Speaker 0: I'm not adding any of that stuff until season 2 anyway.

186
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got to do something then.

187
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,130
Speaker 0: We got a lot more important things to change than that.

188
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,349
Speaker 1: So, what kind of thing of the day you got?

189
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,010
Speaker 0: Mine actually is a very personal thing of the day.

190
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,149
Speaker 0: You see, being at Sitacon, no, nothing like that.

191
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,989
Speaker 0: It's not a video of anything large that may be associated with me.

192
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:07,070
Speaker 0: So we were at Sitacon, and we had the video game pianist, Martin Lung, and entertainment system doing concerts there.

193
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,450
Speaker 0: Scott recorded one of the songs that the video game pianist did from the audience.

194
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:20,210
Speaker 1: On my shitty, shitty, shitty digital photo camera, which happens to have a video function just in case.

195
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:27,830
Speaker 0: Yep, now I was actually much further away in the booth dealing with the spotlight and the stage lights and the house lights during his concert.

196
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,509
Speaker 1: I don't know why you were doing that.

197
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,650
Speaker 0: Because no one else would.

198
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,910
Speaker 1: So, just leave it alone.

199
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:35,550
Speaker 1: You couldn't hear the concert properly from that case.

200
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,230
Speaker 0: Actually, I could because as soon as I set the lights, I just stood in the back like I used to at club all the time, and it was great.

201
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:40,815
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

202
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:46,206
Speaker 0: It was mostly just because no one else knew what settings to put the house lights.

203
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:47,109
Speaker 0: at once he walked in.

204
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:50,709
Speaker 0: Because I just happened to be in the room when we set it up the first time.

205
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:52,327
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

206
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:52,470
Speaker 1: Anyway.

207
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:55,357
Speaker 0: But, this kid is amazing.

208
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:59,970
Speaker 0: We'll talk about him when we talk about the actual con, but here's an actual video of the concert we saw.

209
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,689
Speaker 0: At least a tiny, tiny portion of it.

210
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, a very tiny portion at the beginning.

211
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:11,190
Speaker 1: Alright, my thing of the day, I don't know if I used this already, but I looked on our website, and it wasn't listed as the thing of the day already.

212
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:14,110
Speaker 1: And, so I'm gonna use it, screw everybody.

213
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,870
Speaker 1: Even if we talked about it on the show somehow, you're gonna hear about it again.

214
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,489
Speaker 0: Hey Scott, it's all you.

215
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,190
Speaker 1: Yup, it is all me, whatever.

216
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:32,290
Speaker 1: So, there's a game show in Japan, and the way the show works is they show the contestants fun video trivia things, and then they have this "Hey" button.

217
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,749
Speaker 1: And they kinda hit the "Hey" button a bunch of times.

218
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:38,930
Speaker 1: If it's something they like, they give it more "Hey's" with the button.

219
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:46,610
Speaker 1: And that's all it really is, and one of the segments they showed the contestants on the show was the voice actor of Doraemon.

220
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,510
Speaker 1: And she can apparently beat Arkanoid on one credit.

221
00:12:52,770 --> 00:13:00,210
Speaker 1: And they show you this woman, this like middle aged woman, who's a voice actor of a big blue magical cat.

222
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,350
Speaker 0: She's a little frumpy and surly looking.

223
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:08,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, they show her beating all of Arkanoid on one credit.

224
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,630
Speaker 1: And they fast forward through a bunch of boring parts.

225
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,609
Speaker 1: So you see her playing really really fast.

226
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:15,161
Speaker 1: And at one point her hand gets big.

227
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:16,510
Speaker 1: It's kinda scary.

228
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,870
Speaker 1: But yeah, I didn't even know Arkanoid had a boss or anything.

229
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,530
Speaker 1: Yet this lady can just freaking beat the crap out of the whole game.

230
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, and of course the song played during the boss is in fact one of the songs that Entertainment System played at the con.

231
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:33,490
Speaker 0: It's also one of my favorite early video game songs.

232
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:37,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a really recognizable video game song that everyone knows.

233
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:41,890
Speaker 1: But very few people, relatively speaking, recognize it from Arkanoid.

234
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,560
Speaker 0: Well I was playing it shittily on the piano for pretty much the last month because it was stuck in my head.

235
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:04,878
Speaker 0: And Scott was always like "What fucking game is that

236
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:05,080
Speaker 0: from?".

237
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,705
Speaker 0: And I was like "I don't

238
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:05,947
Speaker 0: know.".

239
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:06,774
Speaker 0: I heard it.

240
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,200
Speaker 0: Because I heard an overseas remix while I was laying in bed one day and I didn't look up at what it was.

241
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:15,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's one of those songs where you could play it for someone and they go "I know that!

242
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,099
Speaker 1: That's from that video

243
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:16,320
Speaker 1: game!".

244
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,764
Speaker 1: "What video

245
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:16,966
Speaker 1: game?".

246
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:17,815
Speaker 1: "Uhhh...".

247
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,780
Speaker 1: And then Arkanoid is the correct answer.

248
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,720
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, Citicon 2006 at the SUNY Institute of Technology in Utica, New York.

249
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:29,611
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

250
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:31,900
Speaker 0: Not gonna talk a lot about the campus.

251
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,480
Speaker 0: And it looks like a really nice school, but god damn is it a barren wasteland in Utica.

252
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:41,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, Utica is not the greatest town.

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,220
Speaker 1: I mean, if anyone is complaining about, you know, Baltimore being bad, or Jersey sucking, or any other town sucking for conventions...

254
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,340
Speaker 0: You can shut your pie holes.

255
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,940
Speaker 1: Utica is perhaps the worst place to have a convention ever.

256
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,067
Speaker 0: I mean, it seemed alright.

257
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,860
Speaker 0: You know, we show up, you know, Friday evening.

258
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,464
Speaker 0: Now first we drive in Friday, right?

259
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:02,292
Speaker 0: No one is on this campus.

260
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:05,260
Speaker 0: I mean, not a single god damn person.

261
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,660
Speaker 1: Well, they had a four day weekend apparently for Columbus Day, which I did not know until later.

262
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,440
Speaker 1: But apparently that made most of the 2,500 students on campus leave and head for the hills.

263
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, RIT, all the unhit people would leave whenever there's a break.

264
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:23,940
Speaker 0: And all the awesome people would stay on campus and make even more mischief than usual.

265
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,620
Speaker 1: Unless they were forced to leave, which were on occasion.

266
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,023
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, but whatever.

267
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:34,540
Speaker 0: You know, we show up and we walk in the door and there's this school store right next to the artist alley where we have all our equipment set up.

268
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:37,880
Speaker 0: And they sell Red Bull and balls and food and everything we thought we would need.

269
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Speaker 0: Turns out, they closed at 5pm on Friday and are not open on weekends.

270
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,860
Speaker 0: Thus cutting us off from any source of nourishment.

271
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,279
Speaker 1: We had to drive to get anything and the only place to get anything in this town was Walmart.

272
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,138
Speaker 0: In fact, we asked around and everyone we talked to said, "You can go to the

273
00:15:57,178 --> 00:15:57,580
Speaker 0: Walmart?".

274
00:15:58,502 --> 00:15:59,980
Speaker 0: There's a McDonald's in the Walmart.

275
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,146
Speaker 0: Wow.

276
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,360
Speaker 1: Just wow.

277
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,517
Speaker 0: Of course, the sad thing is, you know, everyone we talked to was like, "Yeah, there's nowhere to

278
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:05,758
Speaker 0: eat.".

279
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,800
Speaker 0: But then we drive over to the hotel with the con chair and there's a million restaurants that they just were stupid and didn't tell us about.

280
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:13,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with these people.

281
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,120
Speaker 1: Maybe they're a freshman without cars.

282
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I mean, there's a Delmonico's and a bunch of pizza places and a couple bars.

283
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a lot of fast food over there too, but you know, there were places to eat.

284
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,880
Speaker 1: Not many, but they were there and there were enough of them to get us through a weekend.

285
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:36,780
Speaker 0: The only point I want to make, and we're going to do a whole show on this in the near future, is that SUNY IT is probably a great school to learn about IT and computer stuff.

286
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,240
Speaker 0: But to all of you people at RIT who might complain about the tuition at RIT, you get what you fucking paid for.

287
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,485
Speaker 1: Holy shit do you get what you paid for.

288
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:52,740
Speaker 1: There were things at RIT that I took for granted, like having projectors in every classroom that work.

289
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,120
Speaker 1: You know, having very fast internet connections everywhere, having wireless everywhere.

290
00:16:58,303 --> 00:16:59,218
Speaker 0: Having a tech crew.

291
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,540
Speaker 1: Having a tech crew, having large classrooms that can support having lots of people in them.

292
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:12,480
Speaker 0: Having coffee shops with subsidized coffee open on campus pretty much 24/7 and grocery stores on campus.

293
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,160
Speaker 1: Having a big ass library and lots of computer labs and more than three non-residential buildings.

294
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,819
Speaker 0: Having soda machines that don't completely run empty before Friday night at a con.

295
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:30,480
Speaker 1: Having cards that you can buy things with and multiple places to eat food from.

296
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,478
Speaker 1: Having a gym that's separate from the SAU.

297
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,532
Speaker 1: Anyway.

298
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get what you pay for.

299
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, so quit your bitching about RIT.

300
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,460
Speaker 1: That's right.

301
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,662
Speaker 0: But on to the con.

302
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:48,080
Speaker 0: Now, showing up at the con, I mean it was a really short drive, was a very heartening experience because we had no idea what to expect.

303
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,740
Speaker 0: Cidicon had come out of the blue and asked us to come to the convention and then went so far as to offer to pay all of our expenses.

304
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,959
Speaker 1: So of course we went.

305
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,211
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean forget MangaNext.

306
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:00,559
Speaker 0: We would have had to pay to get in there.

307
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,378
Speaker 0: What kind of panel could we do?

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,240
Speaker 1: Nothing.

309
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we show up and we have no idea what to expect at all.

310
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,960
Speaker 1: Well, I expected it to be a relatively small con.

311
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,320
Speaker 1: Like if more than 300 people showed up, I would have been like jumping out of my socks surprised.

312
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean in terms of like people or anything, we didn't know what was going on.

313
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,539
Speaker 1: We had no clue, not at all.

314
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:27,000
Speaker 0: So we walk into the, you know, the only building and there are like 15 people wearing red staff shirts standing there like they're waiting for us.

315
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,795
Speaker 1: Yep, so we're like, "Hey, what's

316
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:28,998
Speaker 1: up?".

317
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I gotta say the convention was really professionally run.

318
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:39,180
Speaker 0: The con chair, Corbin, really had his act together and it was- Well, Andrew Corbin, but Corbin's his last name.

319
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,259
Speaker 0: I can't call him anything but Corbin.

320
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:42,600
Speaker 1: Me either, me either.

321
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,800
Speaker 0: God, you know how many times I made multi-pass jokes this weekend?

322
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,418
Speaker 0: Multi-pass.

323
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:47,360
Speaker 0: Multi-pass.

324
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:50,000
Speaker 0: Hi, I'm Corbin Dallas.

325
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:59,100
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah, he ran a tight ship and his staff was pretty competent and this con was run better than some much bigger cons I've been to.

326
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:10,480
Speaker 1: Imagine if you went to Otacon and there was the same number of staff and, you know, there was the same, everything that happens at Otacon was the same, only there were half as many people there.

327
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:20,700
Speaker 1: So you got, you know, you didn't have to, all the problems caused by lots of people, you wouldn't be a panel you couldn't get into, you could sit right at the front of every concert and event.

328
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,226
Speaker 1: You know, you could get whatever you wanted in the dealer's room.

329
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:30,480
Speaker 1: All those problems caused by too many people in competition among con members, go away.

330
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,443
Speaker 1: That is what Cinecon was like.

331
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:41,945
Speaker 1: It was a convention that was run for, they could have handled, you know, the only reason I would say they couldn't have handled a thousand people is because the main auditorium couldn't hold that many people.

332
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:48,420
Speaker 1: So they could have handled easily three to five hundred people and there were maybe a hundred to two hundred people.

333
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,710
Speaker 0: Yep, but they ran everything as though, I mean they ran a tight ship regardless of how many people were around.

334
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,700
Speaker 0: They'd go to a panel room and do everything to make it happen even if one guy showed up to it.

335
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,805
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean we were lazier than they were.

336
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:08,699
Speaker 1: By Sunday we had given up and we went to our panel room and said, "If you're here for our panels, go to Artist Alley, that's where we

337
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:08,880
Speaker 1: are.".

338
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,500
Speaker 0: Granted, Sunday was a pretty dead day, understandably.

339
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,466
Speaker 1: It was a very dead day.

340
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:16,680
Speaker 1: They really should have made it a one day con, really.

341
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, or what I would have done is I would have made it a Friday night through Sunday morning con.

342
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:23,420
Speaker 0: Like it stops at 4am on Sunday.

343
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:37,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, going all day Sunday was, I mean, sure it made up for not going all day Friday and only doing Friday night, but really Sunday afternoon, there's a reason cons end in the middle of the day on Sunday, even really big ones.

344
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:41,056
Speaker 1: It's because no one hangs around late on Sunday.

345
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:41,779
Speaker 1: They have to go home.

346
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:55,280
Speaker 0: So also, aside, another aside, not really related to the con, but for probably the first time in a long time, other than maybe KatsuCon where I do this, we had a hotel room that was just me and Scott and there were two beds in it.

347
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,094
Speaker 0: We didn't have the whole entourage of the front row crew with us.

348
00:20:58,134 --> 00:20:59,059
Speaker 0: We had a private room.

349
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:08,638
Speaker 1: Now usually our plan ever since the college days was to cram as many people as we could into as few hotel rooms as we could comfortably sleep.

350
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:09,820
Speaker 1: to save money.

351
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,831
Speaker 1: You know, if a hotel room is $100 a night and it's one person in it, that's like $300 for one guy.

352
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:20,399
Speaker 1: If there's 10 people in it, well, that's $30 per person.

353
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:20,840
Speaker 1: Awesome.

354
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:28,800
Speaker 0: I mean, the way we run Otacon, it typically costs $100 per person to stay in the rooms with us from Thursday until Sunday.

355
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:36,008
Speaker 0: Yet, having a room to yourself is something that is worth all of the money.

356
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:40,354
Speaker 0: And I think at Otacon next year, we are going to get four rooms.

357
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:45,000
Speaker 0: One of those rooms is just going to be like me and Scott and maybe one or two other people at most.

358
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:47,620
Speaker 0: And then we're going to cram everyone else into the other three rooms.

359
00:21:48,241 --> 00:22:02,320
Speaker 1: It was definitely awesome to have an entire bed to myself, be able to throw my shit everywhere without worrying about it getting mixed up with anyone else's shit and not having to wait for the shower or having to worry about other people delaying my con doings.

360
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:16,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean at Otacon, I mean, it sucks, but I have to wake up two hours before I want to get up, take a shower, and then coordinate everyone else showering in some sort of optimal manner or the room goes to shit and no one gets to the con.

361
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:16,920
Speaker 0: Yeah.

362
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:19,000
Speaker 0: At this con, I woke up and I got right in the shower.

363
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:27,959
Speaker 1: If we had our own room at Otacon or any other convention, we could get up, shower, and leave, and leave everyone else with their own devices and be like, "Screw you

364
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:28,300
Speaker 1: guys.".

365
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:28,712
Speaker 1: Yeah.

366
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,410
Speaker 1: Because everyone would have keys to those rooms and whatever.

367
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:34,960
Speaker 1: We got our own room, we got our own keys, we don't need you.

368
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,940
Speaker 0: So before we continue, we set up in the artist alley with a pirate flag and a bunch of apples and all our stuff and our flyers and everything.

369
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,219
Speaker 1: And we brought all this equipment there.

370
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,964
Speaker 0: That we didn't use, though we could have.

371
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:52,200
Speaker 0: I mean, entertainment system wanted to be interviewed, the video game pianist wanted to be interviewed, pretty much a lot of people wanted to be interviewed.

372
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,673
Speaker 0: We just didn't really feel like doing it at the con.

373
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:57,340
Speaker 0: It really, it would have gotten in the way of the fun.

374
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:07,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the Night Shift guys did a 20, 30 minute podcast at the con and I listened to it and it was good, but no one else really felt like doing any podcasting.

375
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:17,560
Speaker 1: I mean, Happy House of Hentai podcasted all their panels, you know, and it's relatively easy for them because they're way low tech and low effort in their podcast.

376
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,600
Speaker 0: Luckily they make up for it with funniness.

377
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,865
Speaker 1: They make up for it with funniness and spades.

378
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:27,058
Speaker 1: I was sketchy, I was like, "Happy House of Hentai, those sound like they're going to be scary

379
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:27,660
Speaker 1: perverts.".

380
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,059
Speaker 0: And they ended up being awesome.

381
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,401
Speaker 1: They ended up being awesome.

382
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:31,763
Speaker 1: All the guests were awesome.

383
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:47,600
Speaker 1: Basically at this con, sure there were some awesome con attendees, but most of the con for us was a bunch of awesome guests and some awesome staff hanging out, being awesome together, while all occasional people milled about around us.

384
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,280
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean one of the panels we got dragged into doing, and it was just us and Corbin, was basically Your Favorite Anime Sucks.

385
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:59,159
Speaker 1: He kind of dragged us into it and we were kind of like, "Eh, whatever, alright, we got nothing better to

386
00:23:59,199 --> 00:23:59,320
Speaker 1: do.".

387
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,100
Speaker 0: And we did Late Late Night on Saturday.

388
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,700
Speaker 1: And he liked doing it so much, he made us do it again the next day.

389
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,360
Speaker 0: And the thing is, the people who were there liked it so much that they all came back to see it again in the morning.

390
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then we remembered to actually tell them to listen to Geek Nights.

391
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we totally didn't plug ourselves, we just did stuff at the con.

392
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:25,160
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean, the panels we ran, like the podcast using Nightpannel or the Your Favorite Anime Sucks panel.

393
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,459
Speaker 1: We didn't record any of these panels.

394
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:33,720
Speaker 0: But they were awesome, because it was basically just us hanging out in front of the room and people listening to us and being entertained.

395
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, so from now on, if you guys out there listening to the show, you're not going to have the luxury of hearing all our con panels podcasting anymore.

396
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,410
Speaker 1: We're not going to podcast all of them.

397
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,040
Speaker 1: In fact, we're not going to podcast most of them.

398
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,440
Speaker 1: So you're going to have to come to cons to hear us now, or you're missing out on something.

399
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, though we did record the Podcasters Unite panel.

400
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:57,240
Speaker 0: I'm trying to clean it up, because for various reasons it couldn't be recorded very well.

401
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,700
Speaker 0: Because all the other podcasters want it, but I'm not going to bother with trying to plan it on our show.

402
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,266
Speaker 1: No, we're not going to plan it on our show.

403
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:06,440
Speaker 1: You're going to have to listen to one of the other podcasters who was at the con.

404
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,579
Speaker 1: They might put it up if they think it's okay with them.

405
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,240
Speaker 0: So I guess before we continue, the guests we hung out with at the con were all awesome.

406
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,600
Speaker 1: Everyone was awesome.

407
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,040
Speaker 0: We had, of course, Dave and Joel from one of my favorite new podcasts, Fast Karate for the Gentlemen.

408
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:27,940
Speaker 1: Dave and Joel, Fast Karate for the Gentlemen is two guys who are hilarious talking about, I guess, anime.

409
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,030
Speaker 1: And making lots of awesome, hilarious jokes.

410
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,760
Speaker 1: You know our joke about you can't attend Pokemon.

411
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,977
Speaker 0: You can't attend Pokemon.

412
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,520
Speaker 1: It's kind of like that styling, which is why it's so awesome.

413
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:40,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, their style of humor is infectious.

414
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:45,460
Speaker 0: And also, we ran an anime match game, which went over really, really well.

415
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:47,679
Speaker 0: We're going to try to do this at Otakana Katsukan now.

416
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,380
Speaker 0: But they were panelists, and good God are those guys hilarious.

417
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,000
Speaker 0: I want them to be celebrity panelists any time I ever run that game show forever.

418
00:25:58,043 --> 00:25:58,428
Speaker 1: I agree.

419
00:25:59,238 --> 00:25:59,420
Speaker 0: Okay.

420
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, we also had half of the Ninja Consultants.

421
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:03,080
Speaker 0: Noah was there.

422
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, Noah is the male half of the Ninja Consultants.

423
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:11,160
Speaker 1: And, you know, I'd met him before and hung out with him a little bit, but never for real, like this time.

424
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,319
Speaker 1: And he's actually way more awesome in person than he is on his podcast.

425
00:26:15,863 --> 00:26:17,578
Speaker 1: Not that his podcast is bad, but...

426
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,619
Speaker 0: Just that he's a cool dude.

427
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:19,880
Speaker 1: He's pretty damn cool.

428
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:22,320
Speaker 0: Also, we had a Weekly Anime Review.

429
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,060
Speaker 1: Weekly Anime Review is a podcast I listened to once when they interviewed Corbin, the con cherub zinacon.

430
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:34,180
Speaker 1: And I knew about it, but I never listened to it because I didn't really have a need for a Weekly Anime Review.

431
00:26:35,342 --> 00:26:37,619
Speaker 1: But Aaron and Diana were actually pretty cool.

432
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:40,879
Speaker 1: It was like, I didn't know what to expect from them.

433
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,700
Speaker 1: You know, I figured a kind of laid back, normal anime watching guy.

434
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,035
Speaker 1: Which he kind of was, but he wasn't a loser.

435
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:48,960
Speaker 1: He was awesome.

436
00:26:50,421 --> 00:26:53,020
Speaker 0: I love how... You never give anyone a compliment.

437
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,575
Speaker 0: The best you'll say about someone is usually, "They weren't

438
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:56,058
Speaker 0: shit.".

439
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:56,740
Speaker 1: Yeah.

440
00:26:58,022 --> 00:26:58,779
Speaker 1: No, they were way cool.

441
00:26:59,904 --> 00:27:04,540
Speaker 1: I think they were like the only... them, Noah, and Corbin were the only people who didn't smoke.

442
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:07,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they were also the only ones who actually watch a lot of it.

443
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,160
Speaker 1: Martin Long didn't smoke either.

444
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

445
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:11,380
Speaker 0: We'll get to the little smoking thing.

446
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:18,020
Speaker 0: And of course, Lord K and Hello Kitty from Happy House of Hentai were hilarious and awesome.

447
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:20,000
Speaker 1: Even if you're not a pervert.

448
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,119
Speaker 1: If you don't like hentai, like us, we don't like hentai.

449
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:25,720
Speaker 1: We think it's perverted and kind of sick.

450
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:29,338
Speaker 1: And if you tell us you watch hentai, we'll kind of be like, "Okay,

451
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:29,640
Speaker 1: dude.".

452
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,760
Speaker 0: Granted, I've watched some hentai and it's usually hilarious.

453
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,940
Speaker 1: These people, they don't concentrate on the perverted part of hentai.

454
00:27:37,181 --> 00:27:39,620
Speaker 1: They concentrate on the hilarious part of hentai.

455
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:47,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, they did a panel and at one point, all they did was describe straight up the plot of a hentai.

456
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:52,396
Speaker 0: And listening to that being described, especially by them and the way they did it, was just...

457
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:57,340
Speaker 1: It's comedy gold and they've podcasted all those things.

458
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,080
Speaker 1: So if you go to Happy House of Hentai, you should be able to listen to that stuff pretty soon, if not already.

459
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:09,200
Speaker 0: Yep, and of course, last and certainly not least, we had the Night Shift podcast, who I hadn't heard of or anything until this con.

460
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,260
Speaker 1: Well, I heard of the Night Shift podcast from the Citicon website when they announced them as guests.

461
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:19,080
Speaker 1: So I went and I checked out one of their episodes and they talked about cheap beer, one of which was steel reserve.

462
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:21,390
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Okay, whatever.

463
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,197
Speaker 1: I wonder what those guys will be

464
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:23,479
Speaker 1: like.".

465
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,889
Speaker 1: But they were actually awesome guys.

466
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,160
Speaker 1: We talked a whole lot with them about all kinds of stuff.

467
00:28:28,702 --> 00:28:31,880
Speaker 1: And they brought a computer and they were running all the main games on it.

468
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,938
Speaker 0: Man, we spent so much of Sunday playing absolutely shitty old fighting games with each other.

469
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:37,380
Speaker 0: It was great.

470
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, they brought this main cabinet and everyone was hanging around playing games on it all the time.

471
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,560
Speaker 1: They were definitely wicked smart.

472
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:46,930
Speaker 1: And their podcast, I listened to some other episodes.

473
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,720
Speaker 1: It was much better than their beer episode.

474
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,420
Speaker 0: Well, it actually came up in the Podcast Using Night panel.

475
00:28:52,780 --> 00:29:04,198
Speaker 0: Every podcaster out there, especially the people who are weekly or monthly instead of daily like us, everyone always worries about, "What if I get a new listener and they listen to the one shit episode out of the hundred good

476
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:04,499
Speaker 0: ones?".

477
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

478
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,740
Speaker 1: These guys, I think they do twice weekly is the rate of doing their show.

479
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:13,899
Speaker 1: And it's pretty short and it's mostly, you know, hilariousness.

480
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,001
Speaker 0: Yep.

481
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:18,100
Speaker 0: Now, of course, the other two guests, Entertainment System.

482
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,540
Speaker 0: If you've never heard of them, we've talked about them before, they are a Nintendo metal band.

483
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:28,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, we met Entertainment System at Otacon two years ago.

484
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:29,107
Speaker 0: I think so.

485
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:29,840
Speaker 0: They did a concert.

486
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:35,700
Speaker 1: They performed at Otacon to a middling crowd, which we were prominent members.

487
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:39,440
Speaker 0: To say prominent, all right, first off, we're yelling and screaming.

488
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,260
Speaker 0: And then we started a mosh pit, which was broken up by Otacon staff within eight seconds.

489
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:53,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, these guys, they got a rhythm guitarist who's the lead guy, two lead guitars, a bassist and a drummer.

490
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:00,140
Speaker 1: And they freaking just, they have, they're not actually just, you know, playing Nintendo songs on rock instruments.

491
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:03,500
Speaker 1: They actually have composed, you know, pieces of music.

492
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:14,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, arranged pieces of music based on old Nintendo songs, you know, and what their new songs like Mega Man three for three, which is three Mega Man, three songs combined into one.

493
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,480
Speaker 0: And their 007 song is really hard and great.

494
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, their Goldeneye, you know, from the frigate stage is actually really, really good.

495
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,455
Speaker 1: Like I didn't, I was like, I've heard rock James Bonds before.

496
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:26,560
Speaker 1: How good is yours going to be?

497
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:28,049
Speaker 1: Oh, it's real good.

498
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:28,855
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

499
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:40,760
Speaker 0: But at Otacon, we made such a stink at their, at their show that later on we were going to see, I think we talked about this on the show before, but briefly we were going to see a show like a violent movie.

500
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:46,040
Speaker 0: and they come up and they point us, they're like, it's those guys, those guys are awesome.

501
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,420
Speaker 1: And we said, it's those guys, those guys are awesome.

502
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,200
Speaker 0: And it's two groups of guys who were being fannish at each other and it was hilarious.

503
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:56,440
Speaker 1: And then we saw, we saw them at a Citicon.

504
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,251
Speaker 1: They actually showed up to do their shows and everything.

505
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:01,280
Speaker 1: And you know, we rocked out.

506
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,006
Speaker 1: They did two concerts, actually one in sort of an open room, and then one right before.

507
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:09,160
Speaker 1: the video game pianist did his thing after and after the cosplay.

508
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,960
Speaker 0: So of course we know here's the difference between Otacon and Citicon.

509
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,008
Speaker 0: At Otacon, the staff broke up our mosh pit.

510
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,940
Speaker 0: At Citicon, the staff started their own mosh pit.

511
00:31:19,262 --> 00:31:22,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just rocking out with the staff at the first concert.

512
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:22,780
Speaker 1: It was way cool.

513
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,380
Speaker 1: And then we went out to him after and he's like, yeah, I remember you guys from Otacon.

514
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,340
Speaker 0: And they gave us free t-shirts.

515
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,440
Speaker 1: They gave us t-shirts because we rocked out the most, more than anyone else at their concert.

516
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:40,060
Speaker 0: So if you at all like video game music or metal, I highly suggest you check out Entertainment System.

517
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,420
Speaker 1: Myspace.com/entertainment-system.

518
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,609
Speaker 0: They got some CDs out.

519
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,200
Speaker 0: Apparently they sell out constantly.

520
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, the CD is constantly sold out.

521
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:53,758
Speaker 1: They're gonna do a big show in State College, Pennsylvania, which is where Penn State is, and that's October 28th.

522
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,270
Speaker 1: So if you're gonna go, if you're anywhere near Penn State, State College, Pennsylvania, go there and see the show.

523
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:01,720
Speaker 1: It's gonna be their biggest show.

524
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,240
Speaker 1: And then they're going to the West Coast apparently.

525
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, and hopefully I'd love to see him play out here.

526
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,900
Speaker 0: I'm gonna see if I can get him into RIT or something for some big gig somewhere.

527
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,980
Speaker 1: That would be pretty awesome.

528
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, a band like that at RIT would just go crazy.

529
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:16,339
Speaker 1: They would indeed.

530
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:24,278
Speaker 0: Yep, and in addition to them, we had Martin Leung, I hope I'm pronouncing his last name wrong, the video game pianist.

531
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,006
Speaker 1: You might remember this guy.

532
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:33,040
Speaker 1: He was famous on YouTube and E-Bombs World and everything because he played Mario blindfolded and backwards and everything like that.

533
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:47,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, in addition to being a classically trained, damn fine pianist, I mean, to put it in perspective, he is, and not to knock piano squall at all, but he is as better than piano squall as piano squall is better than me.

534
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,140
Speaker 0: This kid is amazing.

535
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,460
Speaker 0: He is freaking amazing.

536
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,179
Speaker 0: Because I'm a shit piano player.

537
00:32:52,782 --> 00:32:55,600
Speaker 1: And I'm not a piano player at all.

538
00:32:56,581 --> 00:33:00,980
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess I'm better than absolute zero, but it's like one degree.

539
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,120
Speaker 0: So, you know, he's famous on the internets now and he plays all these big things and they flew him out to Sitacon to play a concert.

540
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,072
Speaker 1: And he's not lying about his skills.

541
00:33:10,253 --> 00:33:11,780
Speaker 1: Let's just put it that way.

542
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, if anything, this kid is way too humble.

543
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,819
Speaker 0: He deserves to have a little bit more ego about how cool he is.

544
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,517
Speaker 1: Not like us, where we're like, "Oh, we're so awesome and we're only mostly

545
00:33:22,657 --> 00:33:22,939
Speaker 1: awesome.".

546
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:24,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're like, "We're so awesome, blah, blah,

547
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:24,960
Speaker 0: blah.".

548
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,450
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Eh, I just do what I do.

549
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,875
Speaker 0: I'm an okay student at my

550
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:29,257
Speaker 0: school.".

551
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,719
Speaker 1: You know what I mean?

552
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,420
Speaker 1: He said there were 40 other students studying classical piano at his school.

553
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:36,351
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Well, are you better than them?

554
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:36,996
Speaker 1: Are they better than

555
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:37,177
Speaker 1: you?".

556
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:39,599
Speaker 1: Apparently he's been playing piano since he was four.

557
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:43,680
Speaker 1: And he just, you know, he wouldn't say anything so great.

558
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,577
Speaker 1: We're like, "Oh, we're so

559
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:44,700
Speaker 1: old.".

560
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,512
Speaker 1: 'Cause we asked him how old he was.

561
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:47,281
Speaker 1: He said 19.

562
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:48,292
Speaker 1: And all of us were like, "Aw,

563
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:48,757
Speaker 1: shit.".

564
00:33:49,642 --> 00:33:50,779
Speaker 0: 'Cause we were all in the mid-20s.

565
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,353
Speaker 1: He's gonna be 20 real soon, though.

566
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:53,380
Speaker 1: He's almost 20.

567
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:53,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

568
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,797
Speaker 1: But the point is, he's like, "Oh, you guys aren't so

569
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:57,059
Speaker 1: old.".

570
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:57,868
Speaker 1: We're like, "Shut up,

571
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:58,010
Speaker 1: you.".

572
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:00,933
Speaker 0: So, he put on a great concert.

573
00:34:00,953 --> 00:34:02,200
Speaker 0: I mean, the crowd loved it.

574
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,900
Speaker 0: And there was a pretty big crowd for this concert.

575
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:04,337
Speaker 0: Yeah.

576
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:05,540
Speaker 0: It was after the cosplay.

577
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:06,985
Speaker 1: After the cosplay.

578
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:10,000
Speaker 1: It was cosplay, entertainment system, Martin Long.

579
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,540
Speaker 0: Yep.

580
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:15,252
Speaker 0: And then, after that, of course, us and the con chair, and what was the other guy's name?

581
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:15,880
Speaker 0: The other staffer.

582
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,768
Speaker 0: Uh... Oh, I'm sorry, dude.

583
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:19,958
Speaker 0: We forgot your name, but you were cool.

584
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:30,498
Speaker 0: So, us, the con chair, Corbin, this other cool guy, and the video game pianist, went out to Delmonico's to get some steak for dinner 'cause we hadn't eaten anything of note all day.

585
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that was a good time, eating dinner.

586
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:37,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, the con could barely function without Corbin there to run everything.

587
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,185
Speaker 1: That was fine.

588
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:39,659
Speaker 1: Nothing much was going on at that time.

589
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,446
Speaker 0: Yeah.

590
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:43,900
Speaker 0: So, they had a cosplay in addition to all this.

591
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,146
Speaker 1: All right, the cosplay.

592
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,080
Speaker 1: We're going backwards in time to the cosplay.

593
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, every con has a cosplay.

594
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,760
Speaker 0: Every con that's good has a cosplay, despite what Anime World Order would say about cosplay.

595
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,587
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

596
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:58,660
Speaker 0: And I gotta say, the people who entered the cosplay were pretty high quality.

597
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:02,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I expected it just to be like a bunch of kids going, but it wasn't.

598
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,820
Speaker 1: It was actually kinda okay.

599
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, no offense to my old alma mater, but they had better, well, at least more people at their cosplay than Tarkon had.

600
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, I must say, though, there weren't any super amazing skits, but what can you expect?

601
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:25,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, though, of note, I mean, 'cause actually, it was funny, Corbin walks by Scott at some point during Saturday, 'cause the cosplay's Saturday night, and he basically says-- It was early Saturday.

602
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he's like, "So, uh, you can run the cos--".

603
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,474
Speaker 0: You're like, "You're set for the cosplay, right?

604
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:31,019
Speaker 0: You're gonna run

605
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:31,119
Speaker 0: it?".

606
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,099
Speaker 0: And then he kinda ran away.

607
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,020
Speaker 1: He's like, "Yeah, we're doing this cosplay.

608
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,474
Speaker 1: You guys wanna do something for it?

609
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:35,898
Speaker 1: Help us

610
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:36,080
Speaker 1: out?".

611
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,017
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Well, what do you want me to

612
00:35:37,037 --> 00:35:37,078
Speaker 1: do?".

613
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,397
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Here's what we got so

614
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:38,599
Speaker 1: far.".

615
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,555
Speaker 1: And he shows me the page in the con book that has the cosplay rules, and then he leaves, and I'm like, "Uh,

616
00:35:43,636 --> 00:35:43,838
Speaker 1: dude.".

617
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,714
Speaker 0: So Scott comes over to me like, "I think we're running the

618
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:47,539
Speaker 0: cosplay.".

619
00:35:48,306 --> 00:35:49,137
Speaker 1: And I was like, "All

620
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:49,360
Speaker 1: right.".

621
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:56,020
Speaker 0: All I can picture is the sound from Anime World Order when Daryl Surratt ran that cosplay.

622
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:58,000
Speaker 1: Oh, that was great.

623
00:35:58,505 --> 00:35:59,360
Speaker 1: And the truth died.

624
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:04,574
Speaker 1: So I called Corbin eventually, and I was like, "All right, what exactly do you want us to do for the

625
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:05,160
Speaker 1: cosplay?".

626
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:07,500
Speaker 1: And in the end, we ended up just judging it.

627
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:14,980
Speaker 1: It was fine, because the part that I didn't want to handle was lining the people up and figuring out who goes on when and who's who and all that jazz.

628
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, but again, props to Citicon for having the staff.

629
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,099
Speaker 0: Everything was totally organized and set up.

630
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was kind of amazed.

631
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,540
Speaker 1: Usually a cosplay will start, like, way after the, you know, allotted time.

632
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:31,639
Speaker 1: Their cosplay started ten minutes after they said it was gonna start, which is basically on time.

633
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially considering the sheer number of people in the cosplay compared to the size of the con.

634
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:46,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, the whole front two rows of the auditorium were filled with cosplayers once they were all done, and about slightly more than that number of people were in the audience.

635
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,560
Speaker 0: Yep, now, on the cosplay panel, we had a bunch of people, like staffers, and the guys from, what, Caffeinated Press?

636
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:57,740
Speaker 1: There was one guy from Caffeinated Press, one staffer, and both of us were the judges.

637
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,840
Speaker 0: Yep, and luckily, I've judged cosplays before.

638
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,459
Speaker 0: In fact, I learned a lot about cosplays from text back at RIT.

639
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,340
Speaker 0: So we were okay to handle this, because Scott, we've talked about cosplays before.

640
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,957
Speaker 0: We know what to do.

641
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:15,540
Speaker 0: And we both kind of filled in everyone else, like, here's how you actually judge a cosplay versus what everyone thinks a cosplay is judged by.

642
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, but screw that cosplay.com buy-the-book stuff, you know.

643
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,699
Speaker 1: See, here's the thing.

644
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:23,279
Speaker 0: I like that kind of cosplay, but I like the free form, too.

645
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:28,520
Speaker 0: Basically, as long as everyone involved in a cosplay knows exactly what to expect, I'm okay with it.

646
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

647
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,080
Speaker 1: So all we had to really do was, you know, every cosplayer had a number.

648
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,200
Speaker 1: We had to take their number and assign the numbers to the awards.

649
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:48,420
Speaker 0: Now, of course, this isn't really Corbin or anyone's fault, but they didn't really... I don't think they knew how cosplay judges need to do their thing.

650
00:37:49,221 --> 00:38:07,079
Speaker 0: As in, he didn't set it up so we could look at the costumes like one-on-one with the people or interview them backstage, which, honestly, the reason I don't fault him is because when I ran that cosplay at RIT when I was president right before I left RIT, you know, that spring cosplay, I totally didn't do that for my judges and Tex yelled at me.

651
00:38:07,864 --> 00:38:09,139
Speaker 0: So that's why I knew to do that.

652
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:14,111
Speaker 0: And the other thing was, you know, judges like to interview like, "So, did you make that yourself?

653
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:14,878
Speaker 0: What fabric did you

654
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:15,040
Speaker 0: use?".

655
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,599
Speaker 0: All that stuff.

656
00:38:16,223 --> 00:38:18,300
Speaker 0: He wanted us to do that in front of the crowd.

657
00:38:18,521 --> 00:38:19,739
Speaker 1: Which is really kind of eh.

658
00:38:20,222 --> 00:38:29,580
Speaker 0: Well, it was fine, except that after the first three people, I didn't want to ask the fourth person a question and none of you fuckers decided to ask a question.

659
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:30,717
Speaker 1: Well, there wasn't much to ask.

660
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:36,496
Speaker 1: Some costumes have something to ask like, "How do you get those wings to stay

661
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:36,699
Speaker 1: up?".

662
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,697
Speaker 1: or "What's that weapon made out

663
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:38,859
Speaker 1: of?".

664
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,076
Speaker 1: or "How long did it take to make that really

665
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:41,520
Speaker 1: intricate?".

666
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:44,418
Speaker 1: or "Is that sewed on or is that painted

667
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:44,679
Speaker 1: on?".

668
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:45,698
Speaker 1: You know, that sort of stuff.

669
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,839
Speaker 0: Though Scott asked probably the best question in this one group.

670
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:50,559
Speaker 1: What question was that?

671
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,100
Speaker 1: The magic.

672
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,879
Speaker 1: Okay, so this group gets up and there are these people, I think they were like evil guys from Kingdom Hearts or something like that.

673
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,360
Speaker 1: And they do this magic trick, which I saw, which is so transparent.

674
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,620
Speaker 0: But the thing is, their stage presence was really good.

675
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:12,980
Speaker 1: Their stage presence was really good and they were pretty cool, you know, in their costumes were above average and everything.

676
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,698
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Can I come up there and do the magic

677
00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:15,939
Speaker 1: trick?".

678
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,077
Speaker 1: You know, I was like, "Yeah, I'll come and do

679
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:18,177
Speaker 1: it.".

680
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,452
Speaker 1: And then they were like, "Uh...".

681
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:22,997
Speaker 1: When they realized that I had figured it out, they were like, "Uh, no,

682
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:23,359
Speaker 1: no.".

683
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:29,740
Speaker 0: But they handled it in character because they were kind of these evil, think like a Gestapo kind of thing, like the aura they were putting on.

684
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,100
Speaker 1: We got to play Kingdom Hearts so we know what the hell these people are talking about.

685
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really want to play Kingdom Hearts.

686
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,097
Speaker 0: But they pulled off this very, "There will be no more magic

687
00:39:37,137 --> 00:39:37,419
Speaker 0: tricks!".

688
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:38,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

689
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:39,254
Speaker 0: "This showing is

690
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:39,578
Speaker 0: over!".

691
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,400
Speaker 0: And they handled it so well that we all voted for them for best presentation.

692
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:52,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the thing was after the cosplay, after people were done doing whatever they were doing on stage, they sat down in the front rows to watch the rest of the cosplay.

693
00:39:53,380 --> 00:40:00,779
Speaker 1: And after those people sat down, the female, who was sort of the lead of their group, was yelling like the greatest shit at all the other cosplayers.

694
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,480
Speaker 0: Like the kind of stuff we always yell.

695
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I thought they were way cool.

696
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,903
Speaker 0: Yep.

697
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:13,600
Speaker 0: Also of note, there were three girls from Quebec who came to this con and cosplayed as very well-done Shinsengumi.

698
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was kind of crazy.

699
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:17,559
Speaker 1: Wow, you came from Quebec to Sitakan.

700
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was really cool because we met him and they had really interesting accents.

701
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,674
Speaker 0: And I thought like, "Wow, they're speaking French?

702
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:25,479
Speaker 0: I wonder if they're...".

703
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:27,999
Speaker 0: And then I talked to him and one of them didn't speak English at all.

704
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,040
Speaker 0: And then I figured out they were Quebecois.

705
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,200
Speaker 0: And haltingly in French, I talked to him a little bit and it was barely enough.

706
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,979
Speaker 0: But luckily two of them spoke English really well.

707
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:36,420
Speaker 0: Yep.

708
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:37,659
Speaker 0: But they were really cool.

709
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:40,280
Speaker 0: And then they won an award too for craftsmanship, I believe.

710
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we gave the person who had the best craftsmanship best in show.

711
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:52,720
Speaker 1: so we get, you know... Normally we would have given... If we would have allowed ourselves to give more than one award to one person, one person would have gotten like four awards.

712
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was this one girl and she was absolutely adorable.

713
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,440
Speaker 0: And I mean that in an entirely innocent way.

714
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,030
Speaker 0: Yeah.

715
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,460
Speaker 0: She was just really cute and she had this costume and it was just absolutely adorable.

716
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:06,819
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

717
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:08,192
Speaker 0: What was it from?

718
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:08,880
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

719
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,599
Speaker 1: I think it was just some thing.

720
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,940
Speaker 0: She had a reference picture, but I didn't look at that.

721
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,660
Speaker 0: It was just... And she did this dance kind of kick thing on stage.

722
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,480
Speaker 0: It was just awesome.

723
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:20,680
Speaker 0: All the judges voted for her in like eight categories.

724
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,460
Speaker 0: Like everything.

725
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,093
Speaker 1: Yeah.

726
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:24,440
Speaker 1: It was sort of an obvious cosplay.

727
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,699
Speaker 1: Like anyone could figure out who was supposed to win.

728
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:28,089
Speaker 1: It was just like, "Oh,

729
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:28,736
Speaker 1: obviously.".

730
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:29,314
Speaker 1: Yep.

731
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,980
Speaker 0: But I mean other than that the cosplay went really well.

732
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,099
Speaker 0: There was a big crowd for it.

733
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,980
Speaker 0: A lot of parents in the audience because their kids were in the cosplay.

734
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:42,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed like a lot of high school kids from nearby came to this thing and their parents were with them and then the parents took them home.

735
00:41:42,602 --> 00:41:44,339
Speaker 1: So they didn't stay for the Late Night Awesomes.

736
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,880
Speaker 1: Which I guess is good because we didn't actually strictly check IDs for all that stuff.

737
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:50,310
Speaker 0: No.

738
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,720
Speaker 1: Like when we talked about hentais and stuff.

739
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Saturday night there was a lot of awesome going on.

740
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,500
Speaker 0: I mean, Happy House of Hentai did their Late Night Hentai panel, which was hilarious.

741
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,938
Speaker 0: And there were a lot of people there.

742
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:13,480
Speaker 0: And then after that the three of us, me, Scott, and Corbin, did Your Favorite Anime Sucks to pretty much until I think 2 a.m we did that for everyone who was left.

743
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,039
Speaker 1: No, we did it way too much.

744
00:42:15,522 --> 00:42:16,260
Speaker 0: It was great though.

745
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,680
Speaker 0: I got to say that's a real easy panel to run and it's really funny.

746
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,920
Speaker 0: And of course, Scott and I have seen mostly the same anime.

747
00:42:23,462 --> 00:42:25,456
Speaker 0: So someone would say, "Make fun of Tenchi

748
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:25,778
Speaker 0: Muyo."

749
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,957
Speaker 0: "Make fun of Evangelion and Kawaii

750
00:42:27,977 --> 00:42:28,260
Speaker 0: Bebop.".

751
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:29,199
Speaker 0: And we'd go nuts.

752
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:36,379
Speaker 0: But then every time someone said an anime that neither one of us had seen and we give each other the look of, "Aw shit, this thing's breaking

753
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:36,500
Speaker 0: down.".

754
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:40,479
Speaker 0: Corbin would bust out and he'd know about the anime and he'd talk about it.

755
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:45,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was generally fun.

756
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:53,360
Speaker 1: I mean, I'd like to see the actual, you know, Your Favorite Anime Sucks panel, whatever.

757
00:42:53,763 --> 00:42:54,639
Speaker 0: Ah, ah, ma.

758
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:58,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, that way I could get a better idea of what I was supposed to do.

759
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,879
Speaker 1: But just making it up as we went along worked pretty well.

760
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, the crowd loved it so much that we ran it again in the morning and almost everyone who was there that night came back to see it again.

761
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:23,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was pretty surprising that, you know, even though we did almost the same thing because they yelled out the same anime, I think what we need to do is we need to figure out which anime people will call out no matter what and write something really clever to say for every one of those.

762
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, except we already had really clever stuff to say for all the big ones.

763
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,780
Speaker 1: So we just need to write it down so we can, you know, save it again.

764
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, we talked about Naruto for like a half hour at night.

765
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:41,760
Speaker 1: You know, that would actually be a good podcast, would be like, Your Favorite Anime Sucks, the podcast, where every week they just pick a new show and for five minutes they say why it sucks.

766
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,128
Speaker 1: Huh.

767
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:48,719
Speaker 1: And just keep going until you've done all the shows because there isn't a new anime every week, so you'd eventually get to them all.

768
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:58,860
Speaker 0: Of course, the Sunday morning panel, we also went on a lot of tangents and talked a lot about just random funny con stories and actually a lot of stories we haven't told on the show yet.

769
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:06,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's what you really have to do, though, for that panel because just saying why animes suck can get a little old because a lot of them is the same reason.

770
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,400
Speaker 1: It's like, Naruto sucks are the same reason that Dragon Ball sucks and Bleach sucks.

771
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,619
Speaker 0: And Yu Yu Hakusho, don't forget Yu Yu Hakusho.

772
00:44:14,013 --> 00:44:14,140
Speaker 0: Yup.

773
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,380
Speaker 0: That show had so much promise.

774
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,440
Speaker 1: Yu Yu Hakusho is basically exactly like Naruto in its suckiness.

775
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,300
Speaker 1: Early episodes, really promising, really good.

776
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,399
Speaker 1: Then it turns into stupid fighting in the end.

777
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:31,480
Speaker 0: So, on Saturday we also ran the Anime Match Game which we had run often at the RIT Anime Club.

778
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,300
Speaker 1: Didn't we talk about this already?

779
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:34,040
Speaker 0: We didn't talk about it in detail.

780
00:44:34,202 --> 00:44:34,479
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

781
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,759
Speaker 0: We just talked about how Dave and Joel were really funny on it.

782
00:44:36,982 --> 00:44:37,259
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

783
00:44:37,962 --> 00:44:40,300
Speaker 0: And we ran it, you know, it's the old 70s match game game show.

784
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:56,699
Speaker 0: We have a bunch of celebrity guests up and Scott was one of them and I was the host and we'll say something like, "Ninja blank" and then the contestant says like, "Star" but then the other people write like, "Gaiden" or "Scroll" and then you have to match the celebrities and get points.

785
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,940
Speaker 1: If you've ever watched the 70s game show, I think it's the 70s game show, it might be 60s, who knows?

786
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,260
Speaker 0: No, it was 60s and it sucked and then it was redone in the 70s and it was hilarious.

787
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,240
Speaker 0: It's one of the most famous game shows ever.

788
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:12,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a famous game show that kids nowadays don't know about unless they watch the Game Show Network which shows all the old game shows.

789
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:18,740
Speaker 0: I felt so old that I actually had to explain the rules to this game show, this super popular game show.

790
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,240
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter because it's real simple to understand and once people get what's going on, it's really entertaining.

791
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:30,120
Speaker 1: It's really, it's not a show about winning and losing because there's really no skill or anything involved.

792
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:33,380
Speaker 1: It's just entertaining the audience with funny matches.

793
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:44,519
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean especially when one comes out of nowhere where, you know, a guest puts down a really weird answer but then the contestant says something really weird and it works out and they win.

794
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,173
Speaker 1: Yeah.

795
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,420
Speaker 0: The crowd ate it up and we had a big crowd.

796
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,380
Speaker 0: We're totally running this at a bunch of other cons.

797
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,639
Speaker 1: We gotta run an anime match game wherever we can.

798
00:45:51,926 --> 00:45:52,011
Speaker 1: Yeah.

799
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,900
Speaker 1: We're gonna spread it around like a fire.

800
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:55,399
Speaker 1: A big fire.

801
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,020
Speaker 1: Alright, so the con had a dealer's room which really wasn't so big.

802
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:06,540
Speaker 1: There were one, two, three real dealers like that were selling merchandise that I can remember.

803
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:12,600
Speaker 1: There was the caffeinated press guys who we met and they were kind of okay cool dudes and they have a business.

804
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,179
Speaker 0: Kind of okay cool dudes?

805
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:18,380
Speaker 1: They weren't, you know, 'cause we said so many other people are awesome.

806
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:21,140
Speaker 1: so I don't wanna say everyone's awesome.

807
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,559
Speaker 0: You don't wanna dilute the awesome pool.

808
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:23,240
Speaker 1: Exactly.

809
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,260
Speaker 1: They were cool guys though.

810
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:33,837
Speaker 1: They were cool guys and they were taking pictures of people in cosplay and then selling them prints of the pictures with their little photo printer there and that's a cool thing to do.

811
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:38,620
Speaker 1: Then you think, you know, other cons, you know, most cons don't have someone doing that.

812
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,300
Speaker 1: You know, Otacon has someone doing that.

813
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:42,179
Speaker 0: Well, most cons do, Scott.

814
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,769
Speaker 1: No, what?

815
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:44,800
Speaker 1: Most cons don't have that.

816
00:46:45,142 --> 00:46:47,500
Speaker 0: Well, every middling to large con does.

817
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:55,160
Speaker 0: The thing is it's usually set up in a very specific way and it's usually-- The only con that I've been to that has that is Otacon.

818
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,959
Speaker 0: Otacon, KatsuCon, Anime Central, OhioCon had it.

819
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,178
Speaker 1: OhioCon didn't have it.

820
00:47:01,061 --> 00:47:01,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, it did.

821
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,380
Speaker 0: OhioCon 2.

822
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,120
Speaker 0: There was a photo suite.

823
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:10,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a photo suite, but it's not where you can get your picture taken and then they sell you a print.

824
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:14,260
Speaker 1: They take your picture and then they put it on their website or in their whatever and they show it to you.

825
00:47:14,743 --> 00:47:15,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, they usually give it to you too.

826
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do have the unique thing that they actually give you prints of it.

827
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're selling you prints of the photos.

828
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:35,078
Speaker 1: I mean, you can go to a con like Anime Next, a fans view is there and you could go into the photo suite and a fans view would take your picture and put it on their website, but they weren't selling you printouts of your photo, you know, which is what these guys do.

829
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:43,419
Speaker 1: And basically they're hoping that cons in the Northeast will outsource their photo suite to them for awesome, which is a great plan.

830
00:47:44,563 --> 00:47:49,880
Speaker 1: And also in the dealer's room was this guy, I forget his name, I have his card I think, or Rim has his card.

831
00:47:49,941 --> 00:47:53,360
Speaker 0: Yep, I got his card laying around in the pile of business cards I took from this guy.

832
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:01,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was an awesome guy and we started talking to him about how he went to, he was in Australia fighting whaling ships and he was a crazy awesome guy.

833
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,100
Speaker 0: And he was promoting a Comic Con.

834
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:08,260
Speaker 1: He was promoting the Syracuse Heroes Expo, which is what I was looking up when I was saying um before.

835
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,460
Speaker 0: Yep, which we would have gone to if we didn't have prior commitments.

836
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:25,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you are anywhere near Syracuse and you like comics, anime, robots, anything like that, that's nerdy, go to SyracuseHeroesExpo.com and this guy was promoting it.

837
00:48:25,674 --> 00:48:28,480
Speaker 1: so it must be good and it does actually look like a good time.

838
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,380
Speaker 1: There's some people there that actually know.

839
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:37,480
Speaker 0: And we're totally gonna get this guy on the show and interview him about just what he was doing in the waters of Australia.

840
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:39,455
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh that's right, C.B.

841
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:40,880
Speaker 1: Cebulski is gonna be there I think.

842
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,499
Speaker 1: He's the guy who wrote X-Men Fairy Tales and he used to work for CPM.

843
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:46,620
Speaker 0: Yep, yep.

844
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:56,259
Speaker 1: He's basically the guy who bridges the gap between the American underwear pervert comics and the world of manga and Japanese stuff.

845
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:02,800
Speaker 1: He actually has a comic coming out in December that I called Wander Lost.

846
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,759
Speaker 1: It's sort of semi-autobiographical deal.

847
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,439
Speaker 1: I'm getting to the first issue just to see what's up.

848
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,280
Speaker 0: Yep, but anyway the dealer's room was pretty small and typical.

849
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:14,274
Speaker 0: They would have liked to have more dealers to the point that we have friends.

850
00:49:14,294 --> 00:49:23,820
Speaker 0: Luke and Gabby run an anime store in Rochester and when he heard that, he was willing to call them Friday night and invite them to come to the con and vent on Saturday.

851
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, he really wanted more people in the dealer's room.

852
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:33,400
Speaker 0: The thing is, not to disparage the dealers that were there, but Luke and Gabby's store could have blown them out of the water.

853
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:48,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, they didn't have any really interesting stuff except one group was selling these really old Tops cards, these Tops collectible cards from Mario and Donkey Kong, the Mario and Donkey Kong game packs.

854
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:54,560
Speaker 1: And I bought two packs of Mario and a pack of Donkey Kong and they're really awesome.

855
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,758
Speaker 0: It had the gum in it.

856
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:04,480
Speaker 1: Well, the Donkey Kong pack had the gum in it and I was gonna challenge someone to eat the gum or eat it myself, but part of the gum was brown.

857
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:06,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was either-- I still have the gum.

858
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,380
Speaker 1: There was either something growing on it-- It's not getting any worse than it was three days ago.

859
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:15,080
Speaker 0: Or some kind of industrial solvent has leaked into that shit.

860
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,380
Speaker 1: I mean, this pack of gum is already really, really old.

861
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,440
Speaker 1: It's not getting much older.

862
00:50:22,161 --> 00:50:28,080
Speaker 0: But actually, the one dealer had Death Notes and he had a bunch of Nana stuff and I almost bought some.

863
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,920
Speaker 0: And a Lockus Kline tumbler that I almost bought.

864
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:32,479
Speaker 1: A Lockus Kline tumbler, you say?

865
00:50:32,641 --> 00:50:33,279
Speaker 0: It was pretty cool.

866
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,680
Speaker 0: The problem with it was it looked really cool.

867
00:50:35,801 --> 00:50:45,199
Speaker 0: except at the very bottom, there's a hint, I'm pretty sure that that was from some sort of not very kosher picture of Lockus.

868
00:50:45,883 --> 00:50:48,080
Speaker 0: But that part was cropped out, so it looked cool.

869
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:54,540
Speaker 0: But I got this idea that it was probably taken from a not-so-savory picture of Lockus Kline.

870
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:58,700
Speaker 1: I was looking for some magnets, like refrigerator magnets of anime, and I didn't find any there.

871
00:50:59,642 --> 00:51:09,199
Speaker 1: Oh, and also, Broccoli Entertainment sent Citicon a bunch of merchandise and they sold it at the Citicon table in the dealer's room along with the Citicon stuff.

872
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:12,054
Speaker 1: That was about the dealer's room.

873
00:51:12,316 --> 00:51:12,619
Speaker 1: That's it.

874
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,700
Speaker 0: Now, the rest of the con, they had a whole crazy ton of anime showings and they had a whole crazy ton of gaming.

875
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,756
Speaker 0: They had a lot of video.

876
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a whole lot of Fullmetal Alchemist trading card game going on.

877
00:51:23,883 --> 00:51:24,574
Speaker 0: And a lot of D&D.

878
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:34,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a whole D&D campaign going on and I saw six or seven people in there playing it, which is a lot of people for a small convention like this.

879
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,360
Speaker 0: I mean, you'd be in the artist alley, which was basically podcast alley, and there'd be no one around.

880
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:39,955
Speaker 0: You're like, "What the

881
00:51:39,976 --> 00:51:40,059
Speaker 0: hell?".

882
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,138
Speaker 0: But then you go over to the other building and, "Oh, that's where everyone from the con

883
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:43,260
Speaker 0: is.".

884
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,260
Speaker 1: There were always four guys playing Smash Brothers.

885
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,619
Speaker 1: There were always two people playing DDR without pads using game pads instead of foot pads.

886
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:58,880
Speaker 1: And there were always six people playing D&D and five guys playing FMA, the trading card game, at all times.

887
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:06,500
Speaker 0: And a lot of people had DSs, but not as many people as other big cons, but there wasn't really so much opportunity to play DS games.

888
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were too busy hanging out with all these guests, doing awesome stuff and talking about awesome stuff.

889
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,040
Speaker 1: There wasn't a lot of DS playing.

890
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:19,159
Speaker 1: Although the Night Shift podcast guy who hadn't really used a DS, he pickedo chatted.

891
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:20,611
Speaker 1: And he was like, "Aw,

892
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:21,198
Speaker 1: mans!".

893
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:22,699
Speaker 1: He was all about it.

894
00:52:23,442 --> 00:52:24,159
Speaker 0: So much for the PSP.

895
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:25,679
Speaker 1: So much for it.

896
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, he said he used the PSP and wasn't interested, so I think he might be going to get a DS.

897
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:34,478
Speaker 1: If someone can demonstrate to him that there's some games he'll like, he'll go for it.

898
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:42,339
Speaker 1: I think he's an RPG guy, too, so there's some RPGs on the DS, especially when Children of Mana comes out and stuff.

899
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,760
Speaker 0: Now here's an interesting thing that we noticed.

900
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,800
Speaker 0: All the guests who were coming from the South smoked.

901
00:52:49,841 --> 00:52:50,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was kind of crazy.

902
00:52:51,422 --> 00:52:55,219
Speaker 1: Because up here in New York-- I don't think-- Happy House of Hentai, I don't think they smoked anything.

903
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:56,260
Speaker 0: I wasn't paying attention.

904
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:57,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think they did.

905
00:52:57,722 --> 00:52:58,580
Speaker 0: I think one of them might have.

906
00:52:58,682 --> 00:52:59,599
Speaker 1: Oh, one of them might have, yeah.

907
00:52:59,722 --> 00:53:00,440
Speaker 0: That doesn't matter.

908
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,739
Speaker 0: All entertainment systems smoked.

909
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:07,354
Speaker 0: But it was weird because they were complaining, "How can New York have these no-smoking

910
00:53:07,395 --> 00:53:07,677
Speaker 0: laws?".

911
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:12,396
Speaker 0: And all us New Yorkers were like, "New Jersey does, too, because not that many people smoke up

912
00:53:12,436 --> 00:53:12,577
Speaker 0: here.".

913
00:53:13,342 --> 00:53:15,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should have a thread on the forums.

914
00:53:15,781 --> 00:53:21,380
Speaker 1: Tell us where you live, and tell us how many people smoke relative to the population.

915
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:28,459
Speaker 0: Granted, my assessment of bars in New York City before the smoking ban was a little biased in that I would never go into a smoking bar.

916
00:53:28,802 --> 00:53:30,620
Speaker 0: And all the non-smoking bars are really nice.

917
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,300
Speaker 0: There weren't really any non-smoking dive bars.

918
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:40,460
Speaker 0: But by the same token, I saw a thing that less than 30% of New Yorkers smoke, and the smoking ban was a great thing.

919
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,719
Speaker 0: Bars are making more money now.

920
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:57,020
Speaker 1: The thing is, you go on the street of New York City and walk around, it feels like there's a lot of smoking going on, because one guy smokes, the whole radius around him is coughing, and all these people can't smoke inside, so they're all on the street.

921
00:53:57,121 --> 00:54:01,039
Speaker 1: So the sidewalks have a lot of smoke on them in general, especially near building entrances.

922
00:54:01,623 --> 00:54:08,560
Speaker 1: But if you actually count the people, smoking and non-smoking, not too many people smoke up here in the Northeast in general.

923
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,740
Speaker 1: I mean, sure they do, but not a lot.

924
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, not nearly as much as the South, which I noticed the same thing at Animazement.

925
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:18,260
Speaker 0: A lot of the people coming to the con smoked outside.

926
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:21,180
Speaker 0: But at Otacon, I mean, hardly anyone smokes.

927
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:27,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you looked at the people at this convention, total, it didn't seem like the con staff was smoking.

928
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,140
Speaker 1: It didn't look like the con goers were smoking.

929
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:34,140
Speaker 1: It was the guests that were from far away were like unanimously smoking.

930
00:54:34,941 --> 00:54:36,119
Speaker 0: And bitching about New York.

931
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:44,720
Speaker 1: And bitching about New York that, you know, we walked into Denny's and the guy was like, smoking, smoking, smoking, and we're like, there is no smoking section at all.

932
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,800
Speaker 0: There hasn't been for a long time.

933
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,140
Speaker 1: There hasn't been for years.

934
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,792
Speaker 1: They're like, no way, dude.

935
00:54:49,812 --> 00:54:50,640
Speaker 1: We're like, yeah, way.

936
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:56,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're like, not only, but New York City had an even stricter law before the state one was passed and everyone was fine with it.

937
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:56,921
Speaker 1: Yup.

938
00:54:58,218 --> 00:54:58,339
Speaker 1: So.

939
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:00,420
Speaker 0: It was just interesting.

940
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:07,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I haven't, you know, I had been away from smoking for a long, you know, a long time.

941
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:12,500
Speaker 1: Like, I stopped noticing it because it was so, such a minor portion of the population.

942
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:20,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, when I went to Raleigh for Animazement, and we went to a restaurant, and the waitress said smoking or none, and I was dumb, I was taken aback, like, what?

943
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:22,839
Speaker 0: Because no one has asked me that question in years.

944
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember when they stopped asking the question, I was like, ooh.

945
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,219
Speaker 1: And then it took about two weeks to get used to not being asked.

946
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,980
Speaker 1: And now when people ask, it's all weird all of a sudden.

947
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,220
Speaker 0: Luckily, almost every place I go on a regular basis has banned smoking.

948
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:48,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, but you look at my work day for the past six months is drive to the middle of nowhere alone where there's no smoking in my car, there's no smoking at my work where I'm alone, no smoking on the way back.

949
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:50,420
Speaker 1: I don't encounter smoke now, really.

950
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,400
Speaker 0: See, I do, but that's because I go down to the Bronx and Yonkers.

951
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:01,000
Speaker 0: Interestingly, not a lot, but I'd say about 10% of the people at my company smoke.

952
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,617
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone at my company under the age of 40 smokes.

953
00:56:05,547 --> 00:56:05,800
Speaker 1: Wow.

954
00:56:06,021 --> 00:56:10,099
Speaker 0: All the old men smoke and the old women smoke, but none of the younger people do at all.

955
00:56:11,023 --> 00:56:11,206
Speaker 1: Huh.

956
00:56:11,612 --> 00:56:11,999
Speaker 1: Alrighty then.

957
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:17,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, the one thing I'd like to say is that Corbin, we've mentioned him a bunch of times, the con chair.

958
00:56:19,604 --> 00:56:23,179
Speaker 0: We're not making fun of SUNY IT at all, but he is definitely a big fish in a small pond.

959
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:38,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, just with my assessment of people based on three days of interaction, Corbin and maybe three or four of the staff guys and girls that I noticed were awesome, big fish type people like us.

960
00:56:40,422 --> 00:56:42,920
Speaker 0: We're not talking in terms of big ego or anything like that.

961
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:49,418
Speaker 0: Just in terms of if they had been at RIT, they would have been pretty much guaranteed members of the front row crew.

962
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:49,962
Speaker 0: Yeah.

963
00:56:49,982 --> 00:56:50,760
Speaker 0: Without question.

964
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:52,045
Speaker 1: Look at Corbin.

965
00:56:52,085 --> 00:56:54,480
Speaker 1: This guy is the president of the anime club.

966
00:56:54,741 --> 00:56:57,779
Speaker 1: He's on their student government equivalent, whatever they call it.

967
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:02,520
Speaker 1: He's running this big con pretty much all by himself and he's doing a really good job of it.

968
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,163
Speaker 0: Yeah, a con.

969
00:57:03,203 --> 00:57:13,960
Speaker 0: and honestly, it's interesting that this con in this little school had more staff and more stuff than ToraCon run by the biggest freaking anime club in the country.

970
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:15,002
Speaker 1: Yeah.

971
00:57:15,926 --> 00:57:21,120
Speaker 1: If we had the people who attended ToraCon going to Sitacon, that would have been awesome.

972
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, if ToraCon were staffed by the people from Sitacon, that would be one fuck of a con.

973
00:57:24,861 --> 00:57:26,420
Speaker 1: It would be one hell of a con for sure.

974
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:33,140
Speaker 1: But yeah, this guy was so awesome, yet the area he was in was so lame, he was like the king there.

975
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:47,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta say, after hanging out with him, I mean, no one really knew each other, but after we did one event and Corbin saw what we were all about and we talked a bit, we were fast friends and we'll probably be hanging out with this dude at any convention we all go to for

976
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:47,600
Speaker 1: the rest of the time.

977
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, I imagine whenever we go to a con in the Northeast area, we'll be like, "Hey Corbin, you wanna go to this con?

978
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:52,834
Speaker 1: Hang out with

979
00:57:52,896 --> 00:57:52,938
Speaker 1: us?".

980
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:53,874
Speaker 1: He'll be like, "Yeah, what's

981
00:57:53,976 --> 00:57:54,037
Speaker 1: up?".

982
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:57,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm definitely gonna drag him in if we get panels at bigger cons.

983
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,170
Speaker 1: That's definitely a good idea.

984
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:00,540
Speaker 1: Definitely a good idea.

985
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:07,580
Speaker 0: I mean, all in all, Sitacon was well worth going, mostly for us because it was free and if nothing else...

986
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if it would have been worth it with the money you had.

987
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,859
Speaker 1: Well, no, it would have been worth it simply because of the entertainment system and the video game pianist.

988
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, that alone was worth more than what we would have paid to get in.

989
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:24,540
Speaker 1: I think that if I lived where I live now, if I lived closer to the con, I would have gone all three days and done everything I could.

990
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:38,699
Speaker 1: If I was an attendee of the con, living where I live now, I probably would have gone, paid the fee, just gone on Saturday, and mostly went to the concerts and the cosplay and not much else.

991
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,619
Speaker 0: But from what I can... I mean, that seems what a lot of people did.

992
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:45,539
Speaker 0: But from what I can gather, the con was successful enough that they can probably throw it again.

993
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:54,200
Speaker 0: And now that it was successful, once, and that everyone who went seemed to have a really good time, I mean, no one was complaining about this con at all, from what I could see.

994
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,940
Speaker 1: And next year, they'll pick a date that doesn't conflict with other cons in the area.

995
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:08,200
Speaker 1: I mean, he tried to pick a date that didn't conflict with other cons, and then MangaNex jumped on him, which has pushed because he goes with AnimeNex, which is already an established con.

996
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:10,940
Speaker 0: But I think this con is going to be a phenomenon.

997
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,460
Speaker 0: I mean, I think it's going to get big in the coming years, or at least it's going to stay and get more people and slowly grow.

998
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,500
Speaker 1: It's pretty much going to be the New York State Anime Convention.

999
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,658
Speaker 1: That's what I think it can be.

1000
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there aren't really any big cons upstate.

1001
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, and mostly because New York City can't have anime cons.

1002
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,500
Speaker 0: You can't have ten anime cons.

1003
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,534
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the... Is there a Buffalo Anime Con?

1004
00:59:31,554 --> 00:59:32,179
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

1005
00:59:32,341 --> 00:59:33,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's Yubicon.

1006
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:33,843
Speaker 1: Oh, is there?

1007
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:36,100
Speaker 1: That's right, but that's really small.

1008
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,580
Speaker 0: Last time, Yubicon was... Or maybe it was two times ago.

1009
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:49,860
Speaker 0: Yubicon was at the same time as Toricon, and all I remember is that I knew people who went to both, and I was at Toricon, and everyone who went to Yubicon came back and bitched that they should have went to Toricon instead.

1010
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only other cons in the area would be...

1011
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:54,900
Speaker 0: Well, Anime North.

1012
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:58,099
Speaker 1: There's Anime North, which is in Canada, and that's about it.

1013
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:15,180
Speaker 1: So I really think Cidicon, if they promote themselves more on the internets, because they didn't see them on Anime News Network or any of the other usual places, and if they run the con as well next year as they did this year, they can really basically get every anime fan in New York State to show up.

1014
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,940
Speaker 0: And I can guarantee that we'll go to pretty much any Cidicon.

1015
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially if they pay us to go and have us as guests.

1016
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,520
Speaker 0: Even if they didn't, this con is... I mean, the hotel's in the air.

1017
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,320
Speaker 0: You get a hotel for like 50 bucks a night.

1018
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a shady hotel for 54 bucks a night.

1019
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,520
Speaker 1: But it wasn't that shady.

1020
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,040
Speaker 1: Like, if you paid them 54 bucks, they would have given you a bed for a night.

1021
01:00:34,322 --> 01:00:37,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not going to be some kind of Monte Cristo thing where they kill you for your diamonds.

1022
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was not what it was going to be, no.

1023
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:41,560
Speaker 1: But it was a little bit shady.

1024
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,840
Speaker 0: And of course, to wrap up, we see we gained a bunch of listeners from Cidicon.

1025
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,359
Speaker 0: We're glad you liked the show.

1026
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:49,240

Speaker 1: And all you people, if you join the forums and you don't get an email saying, "Congratulations, you have joined the forums," you're probably using Hotmail.

1035
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:12,999
Speaker 1: And guess what?

1036
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,559

1038
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have never turned down anyone's entrance to the forums.

1039
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:20,180
Speaker 0: We read them all.

1040
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,459
Speaker 0: We personally approve them all.

1041
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:23,700
Speaker 0: We have never saw fit to turn someone away.

1042
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,460
Speaker 0: And furthermore, we've only ever banned one person ever.

1043
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,280
Speaker 0: And goddamn, was that kid annoying.

1044
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:29,660
Speaker 1: He was real annoying.

1045
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:32,419
Speaker 0: I think that's it.

1046
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:33,237
Speaker 1: Yeah, I yawned.

1047
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:33,719
Speaker 1: It's over.

1048
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:34,378
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1049
01:01:35,923 --> 01:01:37,940
Speaker 0: Stay tuned tomorrow when we'll talk about something.

1050
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:38,738
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

1051
01:01:46,021 --> 01:01:48,120
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1052
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,759
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

1059
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,600
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

1060
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:21,480
Speaker 1: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
