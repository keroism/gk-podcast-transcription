00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,568
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Monday January 31st, 2011.

2
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:15,604
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,795
Speaker 0: Egypt versus the Internet's spoiler.

4
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:21,928
Speaker 0: the Internet wins.

5
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:29,004
Speaker 1: Let's do this When skiing.

6
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:31,174
Speaker 0: this weekend, I'm feeling good about skiing.

7
00:00:31,214 --> 00:00:32,420
Speaker 0: remember I'd you fall down.

8
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:35,071
Speaker 0: I did not fall down one goddamn time.

9
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:36,940
Speaker 1: Did you see you stayed in the bunny slip the whole time?

10
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:38,387
Speaker 1: No, not even the bunny slip.

11
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:39,212
Speaker 1: You were just skate.

12
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:40,480
Speaker 1: You're just going around the lodge.

13
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:43,091
Speaker 0: Actually, I went for it.

14
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:50,380
Speaker 0: I went for some pretty tough runs and Any like evil ten black dive and I didn't do any double black die.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,209
Speaker 1: You didn't do any six ninja star.

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,394
Speaker 0: now you didn't do.

17
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:54,540
Speaker 1: you didn't do the course.

18
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:55,405
Speaker 1: That's so dangerous.

19
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:57,780
Speaker 1: It doesn't even have a sign next to it because they don't want you to go down there.

20
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,590
Speaker 0: I saw a guy who was going off that way.

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,153
Speaker 0: I was skiing.

22
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,300
Speaker 1: really there was no sign.

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,252
Speaker 1: So there wasn't an official course what it is.

24
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,420
Speaker 1: He just went right off the edge.

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,320
Speaker 0: So there's one trail where there's kind of this like there's a fence.

26
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:11,200
Speaker 0: That's like don't go past this and the snow is up against the fence.

27
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:18,460
Speaker 0: And there was a guy standing at the top of that snow because the fence is so deep in this one spot that you can Only see like five inches of the fence.

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,869
Speaker 1: Oh, so the fence was such a shallow fence.

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,873
Speaker 1: If you're on top of the snow.

30
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:26,620
Speaker 1: No, this is like six feet tall It's just there's like there is six feet of snow so you can get over the fence really easily.

31
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,933
Speaker 0: So he's just standing there looking down and there's no trail there.

32
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:33,220
Speaker 0: It's just trees and snow rocks.

33
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:34,446
Speaker 0: There's some rocks.

34
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:35,169
Speaker 1: How steep is it?

35
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,624
Speaker 0: It's about like this like a 70-degree angle.

36
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:40,008
Speaker 1: So it's not ultra dangerous.

37
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:41,532
Speaker 0: That's pretty damn dangerous.

38
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:43,658
Speaker 1: But it's not ultra dangerous like YouTube.

39
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,986
Speaker 0: dangerous Captain you've never skied before.

40
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:47,611
Speaker 1: Red Bull sponsored dangerous.

41
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:51,543
Speaker 0: Usually the more dangerous slopes are not the straight down ones They're the rocky ones.

42
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:56,220
Speaker 1: I think free falling straight down like a few hundred feet is most dangerous.

43
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:59,691
Speaker 1: What's more most dangerous than that especially if this jacket rocks?

44
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:02,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's got you saying oh, that's not dangerous.

45
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,648
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it's not dangerous.

46
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,380
Speaker 1: I'm saying it's not as dangerous.

47
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like yeah, nobody's as good a fighter as Kenshiro.

48
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:09,003
Speaker 0: But what it's like?

49
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:11,874
Speaker 1: that I'm saying what that guy was doing was very dangerous.

50
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:12,757
Speaker 1: It wasn't most.

51
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:17,080
Speaker 0: Yeah Scott It's the difference between 90% and 91%.

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,828
Speaker 1: No, it's more like 80% dangerous.

53
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:20,790
Speaker 0: That's way more.

54
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:22,154
Speaker 1: remember skiing skiing.

55
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,844
Speaker 1: The bunny hill is already 50% danger Are you kidding?

56
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:30,173
Speaker 0: You can't hurt yourself on the bunny hill Unless it's a freak accident.

57
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,720
Speaker 0: You're more likely to get hurt by a car.

58
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:42,151
Speaker 0: You can definitely break your brittle old man hip on the bunny sloop if you're a brittle old man if you're a 30 year old Successful normal person with a reasonable amount of body strength.

59
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:42,974
Speaker 1: You're kidding.

60
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:44,900
Speaker 1: You're gonna get a ski pole right through your eye.

61
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:47,563
Speaker 0: It's pretty hard to hurt yourself Severely.

62
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,999
Speaker 1: someone skis gonna go snap off and then go right through your neck and that'll be the end.

63
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:58,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're more likely to get hit by a car in your apartment than have that happen Not on the third floor, but on the first.

64
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,460
Speaker 1: on the first floor you are right, but not on the third floor.

65
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:04,672
Speaker 0: So anyway, I tried a lot of serious stuff.

66
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,520
Speaker 0: And the one thing I was really practicing was jumping.

67
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,314
Speaker 0: I did some the most air I got I have out.

68
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:10,440
Speaker 1: Did they have a ski trampoline?

69
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:12,534
Speaker 1: No, we shouldn't invent that.

70
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:18,300
Speaker 0: basically There was this like set of like three moguls on the way to one of the cliffs that I would ski off of.

71
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:21,520
Speaker 0: So I would jump all three of those and I was going for air.

72
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,820
Speaker 0: I got about four and a half five feet high off of like one foot mogul.

73
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,413
Speaker 1: I can jump four feet in the air just standing still.

74
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,832
Speaker 0: I Don't know if you can my mate.

75
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,020
Speaker 1: Well, I mean technically right?

76
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,204
Speaker 1: Well, it depends how you measure it.

77
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:41,415
Speaker 0: because like if you want to measure if does not measure does your foot your both of Your feet get more than four feet off the ground.

78
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:42,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could do that I don't know.

79
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:44,248
Speaker 1: The thing is right.

80
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,620
Speaker 1: my head would not go out four feet off the ground.

81
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,275
Speaker 0: Most of it would just be yes got my head was going four feet off the ground.

82
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,100
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's a little different.

83
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:52,426
Speaker 0: Yes And I was doing little baby jumps.

84
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:56,160
Speaker 1: cuz I just busy pick my legs up and I think that's already like two and a half.

85
00:03:56,501 --> 00:04:01,540
Speaker 1: So I just need to get two feet of push, you know, and my head would actually only go two feet up.

86
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,174
Speaker 0: But you say yeah, I'm just I don't know.

87
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,160
Speaker 0: I'd like to see you do a jump.

88
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,942
Speaker 0: Maybe we should do some.

89
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:07,146
Speaker 0: we get an HD camera.

90
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:09,092
Speaker 0: We could set up an event.

91
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:10,817
Speaker 1: We need a ruler plus.

92
00:04:10,857 --> 00:04:11,659
Speaker 1: I would use spring shoes.

93
00:04:13,282 --> 00:04:15,351
Speaker 0: You think spring shoes are gonna help from a standing jump?

94
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:17,120
Speaker 0: Yeah without a bounce.

95
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,047
Speaker 1: Well, I start wiggling a little bit.

96
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:21,696
Speaker 1: and then you know, you got one good spring.

97
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:22,760
Speaker 0: You can use the spring shoes.

98
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:24,326
Speaker 0: I'll use a trampoline.

99
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:26,194
Speaker 1: I'm gonna use a. use a trampoline.

100
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:27,640
Speaker 0: I'll use a trampoline with the double jump.

101
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,052
Speaker 1: I'm gonna use a trampoline with a pogo stick.

102
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:30,655
Speaker 1: You know what?

103
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:34,198
Speaker 0: I'll jump out of a building Like those Russians, it doesn't count.

104
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:39,059
Speaker 0: All right, it's Monday, so what do you got for me?

105
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:49,812
Speaker 1: No, so a lot of people on the Internet's lately people on the Internet's, you know So reliable great sources of news is gonna be one of those.

106
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,679
Speaker 0: some guy on the internet says that.

107
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:53,859
Speaker 1: well This is actually a lot of guys in the internet.

108
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:01,420
Speaker 1: But I think it was more of a meme like one guy's wrote a blog post about it So other got into other people's heads and they believed it and whatever.

109
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,419
Speaker 1: But basically they were all complaining that Google search results as of late are very much more spammy and full of bullshit.

110
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:14,818
Speaker 1: sites That are just you know content farms or all right sites that scrape other sites to get high in search rankings.

111
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:16,126
Speaker 0: before we talk About all that.

112
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:18,483
Speaker 0: I have two kind of Assides.

113
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:23,060
Speaker 0: the first one is that you goddamn kids have no idea how good you have it.

114
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,661
Speaker 1: That's right.

115
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:25,347
Speaker 0: think those search results are bad.

116
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,891
Speaker 0: You think those are bad.

117
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:28,135
Speaker 0: go back to 1997 and search for anything.

118
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:35,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a you know, people sort of take it for granted URL into Yahoo and you will not find that website.

119
00:05:36,014 --> 00:05:36,396
Speaker 0: That's right.

120
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,320
Speaker 1: people take it for granted.

121
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,352
Speaker 1: Now that Google works as well as it does.

122
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:47,280
Speaker 1: they did not live through the era When you would use Alta Vista and then you'd use webcrawler and then you just dogpile which would search every search engine all at once.

123
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,043
Speaker 0: You had two choices.

124
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:52,000
Speaker 1: all the search engines were so shitty that you just couldn't find fuck-fuck.

125
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,660
Speaker 0: The choices were that basically Alta Vista would find five sites that were spammy or completely unrelated to what you were looking for.

126
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:02,456
Speaker 0: Yahoo would find three sites that were that had the information you wanted.

127
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:04,882
Speaker 0: that for our Ford That.

128
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:06,047
Speaker 0: that was pretty much it.

129
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, the best way to find stuff back then was still like web rings Oh god, or link.

130
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,373
Speaker 0: remember everyone had a links page.

131
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:13,317
Speaker 1: Okay?

132
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:14,000
Speaker 1: Yeah

133
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:32,008
Speaker 0: The other thing I have to say is that Every time I've seen someone like an actual human Who who's trying to search for something and they can't find it and they complain that they're finding spammy bullshit I look at what they searched for and they clearly just don't understand boolean logic and Don't know how to search for things.

134
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:35,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, they type like people don't know how to search for shit.

135
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,739
Speaker 0: It's like they need to know how to like what kind of food to feed their baby cat like their kitten and they'll search for like cat.

136
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:44,850
Speaker 0: But Yeah, that that's not gonna find but there's gonna find.

137
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,357
Speaker 1: the Wikipedia article on cats, you know It's it's like I have.

138
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:59,460
Speaker 1: you know just from searching even from the days before there was Google's or Alta Vista's right from using like CD-rom encyclopedias like my searching, you know and using like oars and ends to find stuff in them.

139
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,580
Speaker 0: There was an event when I was in middle school in the Science Olympiad like the National Science Olympiad thing.

140
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:11,122
Speaker 0: That was basically search the goddamn internet and they would give you a bunch of questions and you had and you had access to the Internet.

141
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:11,827
Speaker 0: you had to answer them.

142
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,986
Speaker 1: Oh my god, and uh people Goddamn morons.

143
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:17,449
Speaker 0: This was like 1998.

144
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,151
Speaker 0: I think Yeah, no, this was earlier than that.

145
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:23,021
Speaker 0: This is like 1995.

146
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:26,239
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm really good at searching and most people are not so I think part of the red.

147
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:31,140
Speaker 1: I'm not denying that there are none of these bad results in Google at all because I've definitely seen them in my time.

148
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:38,340
Speaker 1: Yep But usually they come up when you search for something that there really aren't any pages that have that information.

149
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:45,407
Speaker 0: Usually where I see the most problem and I think this is where most people who have complaints are searching They search for in quotes.

150
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:47,334
Speaker 0: Usually well, they don't use quotes because they're stupid.

151
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:49,100
Speaker 0: a specific error message.

152
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:56,600
Speaker 0: They got from something and they find a million people asking the same question in a million forums and no one answers it.

153
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,696
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then there's like the expert sex change link and then they eventually go there.

154
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:01,680
Speaker 0: They can't find what they want.

155
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:07,900
Speaker 1: It's actually semi related to the problem of people not knowing where to go to do things, right?

156
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,575
Speaker 1: It's like for example, let's say something happens in our forum a lot, right?

157
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:14,040
Speaker 1: Somebody's in the geek nights forum They're part of our community.

158
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,960
Speaker 1: That's like their number one internet community or maybe number two internet community, right and they have a question about some programming something.

159
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:29,760
Speaker 1: So they come and ask it there and it's like alright, you know that I'm in this forum And you know, I might know the answer but really you probably should ask this question in Stack Overflow.

160
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,134
Speaker 1: We're all the programmers in the world might answer it.

161
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:33,159
Speaker 1: Why are you asking it here?

162
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,063
Speaker 1: This is not.

163
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:36,859
Speaker 1: this is not a question for this location, you know.

164
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,039
Speaker 1: People just don't know to go to the right place to type in the right thing.

165
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,280
Speaker 0: Also people don't know that you can type site colon URL and then it'll only search that site.

166
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:46,866
Speaker 1: I know I use that every day.

167
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:52,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that's often how I'll search not experts exchange but server fault or Stack Overflow.

168
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:03,940
Speaker 1: If you're not like if you if you have an experience where you search Google and you don't find exactly what you want on the first Try every time you need to improve your Google skills.

169
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,551
Speaker 1: So I suggest you go and you read about Google search and Practice Google searching and study Google search and how to use it better.

170
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:13,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean quotes versus not quotes.

171
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:18,471
Speaker 0: Making, you know selective statements picking one site Excluding a term.

172
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:19,518
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

173
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:28,899
Speaker 0: God I just remembered the old days when I would search for something I'd be like I want like pictures of tenchi muyo characters because I wanted to do something with that.

174
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,552
Speaker 0: I'd search for like pictures.

175
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:35,934
Speaker 0: tenchi muyo Minus porn minus sex minus sex porn minus dildo.

176
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:37,780
Speaker 1: Here's a good example from the other day.

177
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,350
Speaker 1: This is a perfect example.

178
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:47,360
Speaker 1: So, you know curl right C URL Which is the library and command line program you use to do HTTP requests and look at headers and these sorts of things.

179
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,540
Speaker 1: Right, so I was using that and I wanted to add a header.

180
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,800
Speaker 1: So I was like, you know I couldn't the man page was too big and I couldn't find what I was looking for.

181
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,300
Speaker 1: So I was like, how do I add you know this XML header to with using curl, right?

182
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:02,009
Speaker 1: And I was looking for the command line.

183
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:06,629
Speaker 1: curl was what I was looking for and all the results I got were for the PHP curl library.

184
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,500
Speaker 1: So I was like I need to know this, you know, this isn't helping me.

185
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,001
Speaker 1: So I did.

186
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:17,577
Speaker 1: I kept my same search query and I put in minus PHP and I pressed enter and what I wanted was a top result perfect done.

187
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:24,844
Speaker 1: Anyway, so all these people are complaining that the Google search result is not as good and they're saying that you should use a different Engine like duck.

188
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:27,170
Speaker 1: duck go or is very popular.

189
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:27,371
Speaker 1: Yes.

190
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:28,855
Speaker 0: Try one of those things shit.

191
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,380
Speaker 0: You're not gonna find anything better.

192
00:10:30,741 --> 00:10:32,569
Speaker 1: I mean, you know 90% there.

193
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:35,320
Speaker 1: the thing is those things kind of work, right?

194
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,700
Speaker 1: It's like you could get by with those but it's like really that's what you're gonna use.

195
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:52,267
Speaker 1: They Google is searching the internet so fast and crawling everything with such an army of computers That even if someone else might have a better result in a term or two They just can't compete as a whole.

196
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:53,953
Speaker 1: this is really no way.

197
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,260
Speaker 1: they don't have the hardware and software resources.

198
00:10:56,401 --> 00:11:00,480
Speaker 1: They you know, and they're not putting that amount of power towards the problem that Google is.

199
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:08,326
Speaker 1: I mean Google came out today with real-time audio translation of Spanish and English Like you could talk to.

200
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:11,820
Speaker 1: you could talk in Spanish and it will start talking may know as chocolate.

201
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:16,559
Speaker 1: You know, it's not Anyway.

202
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:22,622
Speaker 1: So people a lot of people are complaining about Google shitty search results You know.

203
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:27,339
Speaker 1: and there's a guy actually at Google named Matt cuts who's one of the people at Google you can actually talk to I?

204
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,349
Speaker 1: think that's his job is talking and he's is pretty much job is search spam and he's basically constantly working to make it better.

205
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:39,891
Speaker 1: and he did make it better and he's making it better all the time and People are complaining and trying to be like anti-google.

206
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:41,258
Speaker 1: It's like what the fuck is wrong with you.

207
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:49,292
Speaker 0: now There is the trouble Google has is that a lot of there are a lot of content farms or if you make a bad Search query or you search for something where nobody had like.

208
00:11:49,313 --> 00:12:03,256
Speaker 0: there is nothing worthwhile on the internet You're gonna find the same forum post repeated on a billion bullshit ad revenue generating blogs And Google could do better to block that out, but no other search engine doesn't have that problem.

209
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:06,650
Speaker 1: Yeah So, I don't know what I would do.

210
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,694
Speaker 0: a very simple solution.

211
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:09,100
Speaker 0: Google had this and it kind of went away.

212
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,300
Speaker 0: I don't know if they ever added it back.

213
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,959
Speaker 0: I haven't looked too hard because I rarely have problems for my own cuz I you know I'm logged into Google all the time.

214
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:21,880
Speaker 0: It would be cool if I could you know have an option next to any domain and just blacklisted from my own Google searches forever.

215
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,268
Speaker 1: Well, actually they had a thing.

216
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:25,400
Speaker 1: they used to have Google search wiki, right?

217
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,480
Speaker 1: Which is where you could sort of add and remove and customize the results for a different query.

218
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,567
Speaker 1: They removed Google search wiki.

219
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:32,610
Speaker 1: that feature is gone.

220
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:40,460
Speaker 1: However, if you did Google search wiki while it was enabled For your account then all those things that you did are still in your account.

221
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,790
Speaker 1: So it's like your settings are saved but you can't change them because

222
00:12:42,831 --> 00:12:54,030
Speaker 0: remember back in the day before we had good ad blocking I had a program that basically you'd right-click on an ad and it would pop up at the full uri of the ad and You could turn it new regular expression and it would block.

223
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,100
Speaker 1: that's basically how ad block still works.

224
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,140
Speaker 1: The only difference is that now your ad block also subscribes to the easy list.

225
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,480
Speaker 1: You automatically get all these regular expressions that are automatically maintained by someone else.

226
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:19,023
Speaker 0: I would like to do the same thing for Google because I have a feeling that if I eliminated About 20 or 25 top-level not top-level domains, but it's like domains in dot-com and org That would eliminate 99% of the spam I ever seen.

227
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:26,535
Speaker 1: good because they've got a lot of those content farms are gonna be a Bunch of websites all hosted at the same IP address or they're gonna be a bunch of.

228
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,920
Speaker 1: you know, here's the real trick though.

229
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:38,740
Speaker 1: There's a lot of hosts out there that specialize in like spam bad hosting and what they do is they get a bunch of servers And they get is a bunch of IP addresses that are all over the place that are all pointing at the same thing.

230
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,696
Speaker 1: So it's like they could have one hosting company with so many wacky IPS all over that.

231
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:43,720
Speaker 1: It's really hard to block them.

232
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:46,400
Speaker 1: So with those guys is just a matter of time.

233
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,711
Speaker 1: But the thing is because IP before those guys are gonna run out of IPs.

234
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:51,979
Speaker 1: the trouble comes when we get IP v6.

235
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:53,469
Speaker 1: Then what the fuck are you gonna do?

236
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:54,195
Speaker 0: Yep, like.

237
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:59,526
Speaker 0: here's an example Like I just did a search for because this is something I had to show someone to work how to do recently You know an SSL.

238
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:01,094
Speaker 0: when you have run have a chain certificate.

239
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:05,898
Speaker 0: like you have the real SSL certificate and then a chain certificate that goes to the root authority.

240
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,649
Speaker 0: Yep I just show someone how to set that up.

241
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:08,494
Speaker 0: So I look for a web page.

242
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,380
Speaker 1: I don't even know how to set that.

243
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:11,029
Speaker 0: I know it's pretty straightforward.

244
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:13,060
Speaker 0: Just cat it can catnip them both to get anyway.

245
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,547
Speaker 0: Okay, a Firefox actually doesn't give a shit.

246
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:17,773
Speaker 0: And even if you do it wrong Firefox will say the search.

247
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:18,134
Speaker 0: Okay.

248
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:36,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway If you just Google for SSL chain certificate almost every single response is either Hey want to buy an SSL certificate or a bunch of stupid Forums where people are saying hey, I can't get my chain certificate to work and people don't give answers.

249
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:45,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, that that is a problem is when you search for something that can have two possible Verb, you know actions right is how do I get a chain certificate to work?

250
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:47,080
Speaker 1: What is a chain certificate?

251
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,020
Speaker 1: I want to buy a chain certificate, right?

252
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,379
Speaker 1: So you actually when you search for that you literally have to type in more than just chain certificate.

253
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,423
Speaker 1: You have to type in.

254
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:58,940
Speaker 1: I want to you know, where can I buy a chain certificate or chain certificate prices?

255
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:01,516
Speaker 1: You know, if you're looking to how do I set one up?

256
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:03,720
Speaker 1: you had to go yet You might even have to not use Google.

257
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:09,500
Speaker 1: You might have to go straight to Stack Overflow or server fault or Wikipedia there, you know to read specifically about it.

258
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:18,040
Speaker 0: Whoa, whoa Whoa, so the top link Was looked like one of those spammy forum things and it look it's the side looks like a spammy bullshit forum site.

259
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:19,572
Speaker 0: It has the right answer.

260
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:23,407
Speaker 1: So Did it scrape the right answer from stack?

261
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:25,173
Speaker 0: I think it's great the right answer from someone.

262
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:33,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's possible that happens a lot, too Well, but it's really hard, you know, that's the problem that they're working on is, you know, someone scraped something from a different site.

263
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,291
Speaker 1: Well, how do you know which site was the original site?

264
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:35,593
Speaker 1: Yeah,

265
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:46,140
Speaker 0: I think what they need to do And it'd be nice to do some sort of aggregation where if you notice the same content on a bunch of places Come up with algorithms that determine the fitness to either try to determine the source

266
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:48,257
Speaker 1: They already have that they use it on Google News.

267
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:51,919
Speaker 0: Yeah So we have to do something similar for Google search results.

268
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:59,600
Speaker 1: Here's the thing Google News knows how to group news articles together when they're all about the same thing But it doesn't know what the first source of that news was, right?

269
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:13,552
Speaker 1: So if there's an AP story and the AP story gets in like 30 newspapers Which newspaper shows up on top is like the most popular one, you know most linked to or something It's not their original story, which would be AP link as opposed to Chicago.

270
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:14,675
Speaker 1: something link, right?

271
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:17,667
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah Google search results are just fine.

272
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:18,611
Speaker 1: It's not really a problem.

273
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:24,799
Speaker 0: So the Golden Gate Bridge is Finally in 2012 if Quetzalcoatl doesn't fuck it all up.

274
00:16:25,603 --> 00:16:28,035
Speaker 0: Get all electronic toll collection.

275
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:30,426
Speaker 1: Yes 34 job.

276
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:32,132
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, no 34 jobs.

277
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:34,060
Speaker 1: Do they already have an easy pass kind of thing?

278
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,020
Speaker 0: I have no idea, but they're going all electric.

279
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:37,145
Speaker 0: So get this going.

280
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:46,065
Speaker 0: all electric means 34 jobs get eliminated good 34 and they save 19.2 million dollars for the first eight years Really?

281
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:54,960
Speaker 0: Yeah gasps and The only thing I have to say about that is why is there anywhere in this country where I still pay a toll?

282
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:57,453
Speaker 1: With money is we need more jobs not less jobs?

283
00:16:57,513 --> 00:17:00,234
Speaker 1: if we actually made things efficient like I say they were you know, it's.

284
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:08,234
Speaker 0: That's a good argument except for the fact that this was 34 jobs.

285
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:09,880
Speaker 0: it's not enough job.

286
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,885
Speaker 1: No, no I mean This is the thing that I always say.

287
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:19,290
Speaker 1: right if you go to an economist and you say because people were worried when computers were First invented right that the computers would eliminate jobs Scott.

288
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:24,579
Speaker 0: I'm gonna said replace on your statement and the Weaver the loom Steam power.

289
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,665
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but people are always.

290
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:32,340
Speaker 1: we're always worried that technology would eliminate jobs and economists would say no historically that hasn't happened.

291
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:38,680
Speaker 1: But the truth is and I at least I believe the truth is that it's not the fact that technology won't eliminate jobs.

292
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,671
Speaker 1: Is that we don't extract the full potential of technology?

293
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:43,960
Speaker 1: And if we did we would eliminate jobs.

294
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:50,383
Speaker 0: I was about to say there are only 30 toll workers on that one bridge 34.

295
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:53,512
Speaker 1: there's 34 toll workers on that one bridge in the whole country.

296
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:55,197
Speaker 1: There's thousands of toll workers.

297
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:58,307
Speaker 0: Oh thousands Oh, that's not enough jobs to care.

298
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:02,400
Speaker 1: Okay, so in every office in this country, there's people working on spreadsheets.

299
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,560
Speaker 1: I could eliminate all of them at least, you know, five people per office with a single MySQL computer.

300
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,220
Speaker 0: So here is my corollary argument that that's millions.

301
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:16,656
Speaker 0: My argument will get halfway toward refuting you but then it's gonna refute itself.

302
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:19,604
Speaker 0: All right, so hear me out Every other like.

303
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:25,967
Speaker 0: when the Industrial Revolution happened what we saw was that in the very near term Many jobs were eliminated.

304
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:29,420
Speaker 0: You don't need a shit shoveler when you have an automated shit shoveling machine.

305
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,456
Speaker 0: That's right, except when shit shovelers are still cheaper than automated shit shoveling machine maintenance.

306
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:34,998
Speaker 1: That's true.

307
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:45,320
Speaker 0: However Most of the jobs that the US has today It is not cheaper to hire a person mostly because of health care costs and fair labor practices and things like that.

308
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:50,114
Speaker 0: So we can automate all the shit shoveling jobs like McDonald's.

309
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:51,799
Speaker 0: we can just have a fully automated McDonald's.

310
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:58,740
Speaker 0: The only reason they don't is that a minimum wage punk kid is way cheaper than the automatic burger making machine.

311
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:10,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a full-time person is way more money, but in white-collar world where you can't easily like basically Automating all the jobs would save money like getting rid of.

312
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:18,500
Speaker 1: well any job where decisions are made can't be eliminated Unless you can get like if there are two decision-makers You can just get one person to make all those decisions.

313
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,820
Speaker 0: But you could automate most of the spreadsheet ladies who are so-called office experts with a database and some PHP.

314
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:26,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you need.

315
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,400
Speaker 1: the thing is you need one computer guy.

316
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:29,574
Speaker 1: So here's my argument and it's not enough computer guy.

317
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:49,400
Speaker 0: during the Industrial Revolution million tons of jobs disappeared and there were many people out of work, but the savings to the world By removing all this excess labor that needed to be done Created more jobs in the long run because it created all these kind of new jobs that couldn't exist before.

318
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,293
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're supported by the industrial wait.

319
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:52,220
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, you can get me finished.

320
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,544
Speaker 0: I said I'm gonna review myself.

321
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:59,120
Speaker 0: All right, and I think that was the case with every major technological change up until this point.

322
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:10,642
Speaker 0: I think the difference now is that the jobs that are being created by the destruction of jobs due to technology are Beyond the reach of the vast People.

323
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:16,600
Speaker 1: I was going to say that exact same thing unlike previous times where those people were retrained.

324
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:29,566
Speaker 0: we're not seeing that due to a combination of shitty schooling lack of respect for technology work lack of understanding of technology work and the fact that technology is moving faster than government education Politics everything combined can react.

325
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:34,599
Speaker 0: all those things together are creating almost a Kurzweil Ian singularity out of which we're fucked.

326
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:35,462
Speaker 1: for That is true.

327
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:42,045
Speaker 1: when they replaced, you know, the the factory where it's just an assembly line by hand with the conveyor belt You know people were you.

328
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:45,396
Speaker 1: when they replaced the horse and buggy with the car people were retrained.

329
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:53,100
Speaker 0: It's not just retrained It's that once we replaced, you know guys weaving with factories Then we build a million more factories.

330
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:53,763
Speaker 0: that's all.

331
00:20:54,064 --> 00:21:00,895
Speaker 1: but now the thing is when you get computers involved you make less and The people who worked in the thing the computers are replacing.

332
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:01,740
Speaker 1: you're a spreadsheet guy.

333
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,145
Speaker 1: You work with Excel all day.

334
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:07,140
Speaker 1: if I replace your Excel with a web app that just does all your work for you.

335
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,059
Speaker 1: So now you what do you do now?

336
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,785
Speaker 1: There's nothing to do.

337
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:11,287
Speaker 1: you're done.

338
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:12,573
Speaker 0: No, this would be fine.

339
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:13,196
Speaker 1: We're gonna do.

340
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:14,080
Speaker 1: learn programming.

341
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:18,007
Speaker 0: This would be fine If education was somehow keeping up with technology to it.

342
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:29,200
Speaker 0: if kids in school today or learning object oriented programming from kindergarten onward Then they would be entering the workforce ready to be the workers who take these brand new jobs that were created.

343
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,903
Speaker 0: We'd be fine.

344
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:34,400
Speaker 0: But instead it's like education just falling further and further away from practical skills.

345
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:37,160
Speaker 1: Anyway, but I want to go back to this bridge for a second, right?

346
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,180
Speaker 1: All right, so the bridge did it have easy pass like technology before or if I know okay.

347
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,148
Speaker 1: So let's so.

348
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:48,540
Speaker 1: basically you expect me to be a journalist But anyway, the bridge is now be effectively all easy pass only, right?

349
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:51,680
Speaker 1: So if you go through and you have an easy pass, you're good, right?

350
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,583
Speaker 1: But what if you do?

351
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:56,420
Speaker 1: what if I'm from out of town and I don't have an easy pass and I drive over the bridge?

352
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,803
Speaker 1: What then?

353
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:57,690
Speaker 0: I don't know.

354
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,040
Speaker 0: I'm actually trying to figure that out right now.

355
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,959
Speaker 0: He didn't give me enough stalling time to figure it out.

356
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:10,814
Speaker 0: But look at New York right now where it works and on the throughway and they're doing this more and more Jersey even especially on The way to Wildwood they have the just keep driving easy passes.

357
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:12,100
Speaker 0: Gotcha lanes all over the place.

358
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:20,980
Speaker 0: Yeah They do and if you do not have an easy pass You've got to get off the goddamn exit and go to this one toll booth like the last one.

359
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:22,165
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

360
00:22:22,627 --> 00:22:24,454
Speaker 1: But the thing is the toll booth is still there.

361
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:25,760
Speaker 1: This is what they're talking about here.

362
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,272
Speaker 1: I read some of it was that the basically there's.

363
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:29,860
Speaker 1: no there's no cash lane at all.

364
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,851
Speaker 0: Okay, they have an existing system called fast track.

365
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:32,957
Speaker 0: That's much like easy pass.

366
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:45,093
Speaker 0: All right, and Alright I did some journalism just there and it just so happens that the way this works is if you don't have the fast Track whatever system they just take a picture your license plate and mail you the bill.

367
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:46,920
Speaker 1: All right, that's that's pretty good.

368
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,785
Speaker 1: But I got some questions about that.

369
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:52,677
Speaker 1: What if I'm driving my friend's car through the toll?

370
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:53,700
Speaker 0: then he owes the toll.

371
00:22:54,382 --> 00:22:56,650
Speaker 0: What if he shouldn't have given you his car?

372
00:22:56,951 --> 00:22:58,576
Speaker 0: same thing happens if you borrow my car.

373
00:22:58,957 --> 00:22:59,680
Speaker 1: I got my easy pass.

374
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:02,314
Speaker 1: What if I drive so fast?

375
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:03,400
Speaker 1: the camera fucks up?

376
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,492
Speaker 0: So apparently that's not likely and I'm reading some follow-up articles here.

377
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:08,897
Speaker 1: What if I drive so fast?

378
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:09,780
Speaker 1: it photos me twice.

379
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,885
Speaker 1: So guys, let's wait so slow.

380
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:12,728
Speaker 1: It gets me twice.

381
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:15,695
Speaker 0: then basically what I'm reading here.

382
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:22,576
Speaker 0: Is that the way it works If it misses a couple percent of people and doesn't find them?

383
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:23,520
Speaker 0: don't not find them.

384
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,311
Speaker 0: It doesn't told them the cost savings are so much as who cares.

385
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:26,752
Speaker 1: Okay.

386
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:28,680
Speaker 1: What if I'm in a rented car?

387
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,879
Speaker 1: Won't they rent a car place get the bill?

388
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, and rental cars are registered and they'll probably just pass the bill on to you.

389
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:34,984
Speaker 1: How would they know?

390
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:39,200
Speaker 0: because they know who rented the car when they rented it, but I don't have to pay.

391
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:46,780
Speaker 0: I've already given the car back I don't Scott Nate have you found a rental place that'll let you rent a car without giving them either a bank account or a credit card number?

392
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:52,591
Speaker 0: Most rental places now anyway, they have an easy pass just in the car.

393
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,253
Speaker 0: They just bill you.

394
00:23:53,273 --> 00:23:53,895
Speaker 0: All right.

395
00:23:53,935 --> 00:24:00,113
Speaker 1: So what if I Buy a brand new car and it's got the paper plates on it.

396
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:02,160
Speaker 0: It looks like you can take a picture of it.

397
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,291
Speaker 1: I buy a brand new car and I've got dealer plates.

398
00:24:05,351 --> 00:24:06,656
Speaker 1: is a dealer gonna get the bill.

399
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:07,398
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably ha.

400
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:16,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you borrow a car to test drive it then yeah, you're responsible for the tolls So the license plate owners responsible for the toll.

401
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:17,535
Speaker 0: what I'm fine with that.

402
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:18,700
Speaker 1: Okay, I got one more.

403
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:20,004
Speaker 1: I saw this once.

404
00:24:20,064 --> 00:24:20,646
Speaker 1: this is real.

405
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:26,779
Speaker 1: this guy who is a illegal ricer speeding kind of type of guy modified his car as the button that changes the.

406
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:32,536
Speaker 1: He's got a button that slides a cover down over the license plate completely obscuring.

407
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:33,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

408
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:36,977
Speaker 0: All right 0.1% of people get away with it.

409
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:39,124
Speaker 1: Yes I'm gonna totally.

410
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:41,436
Speaker 1: if I live there I would totally get a button right.

411
00:24:41,657 --> 00:24:42,120
Speaker 0: what I would do?

412
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:42,887
Speaker 1: I would push it.

413
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,080
Speaker 1: it would cover the license plates.

414
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,487
Speaker 1: I drive through the toll and push it again.

415
00:24:45,507 --> 00:24:47,880
Speaker 0: what I would do if I were the programmers of the system?

416
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:50,100
Speaker 0: Any car where it can't figure out?

417
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,379
Speaker 0: What for whatever reason what the license plate is to bill?

418
00:24:54,202 --> 00:25:02,074
Speaker 0: It just logs it and then after you know a month or so or running it We just have humans look at all the ones that couldn't do and see what's the cause like.

419
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,920
Speaker 0: maybe I can't read Delaware license plate.

420
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,167
Speaker 0: Maybe there's people pulling bullshit like you.

421
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:11,100
Speaker 1: they see a generic not fancy car going through the toll with obscured life.

422
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,244
Speaker 0: All right, you live in this area.

423
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:13,649
Speaker 0: This is happening on a regular basis.

424
00:25:14,372 --> 00:25:15,576
Speaker 1: So all right, is it?

425
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:16,460
Speaker 1: maybe I don't live there?

426
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:20,656
Speaker 0: All right, then you did all this work to get away with a getting out of like a $15 toll once.

427
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:22,866
Speaker 0: good on you Do it more than once.

428
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:24,735
Speaker 0: eventually they're gonna just have a cop.

429
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:29,600
Speaker 1: They're like, all right Now they've got a cop there which means they've only saved.

430
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:33,529
Speaker 0: No, because the cops not always there.

431
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:45,620
Speaker 0: what I would do is unless I can find a clear You know that the people who maintain the system unless there is a clear trend of increasing Violations of people not having to pay that is adversely affecting the cost-benefit ratio.

432
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:48,068
Speaker 0: I wouldn't give a shit if it's adversely affecting it.

433
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:54,068
Speaker 0: a cop sits there once and pulls over every goddamn guy with the machine And then I charge you with so many felonies.

434
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:56,296
Speaker 0: You couldn't even believe that felony fraud.

435
00:25:56,316 --> 00:25:57,260
Speaker 1: It's not fraud.

436
00:25:57,602 --> 00:25:59,511
Speaker 0: It's illegal to drive without a valid license plate.

437
00:25:59,612 --> 00:25:59,974
Speaker 0: It is.

438
00:26:00,014 --> 00:26:01,140
Speaker 1: they could suspend my license.

439
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,264
Speaker 0: They can also get you with.

440
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:04,954
Speaker 0: you know, you're committing fraud by avoid toll evasion.

441
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:06,420
Speaker 1: I don't think that's fraud.

442
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:08,289
Speaker 1: You can probably argue fraud.

443
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:13,428
Speaker 1: I think it's toll evasion and it's you know Driving on that license plates properly displayed.

444
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:19,951
Speaker 0: Yep, and you know, whatever else you could pro conspiracy to commit Yeah, it is because you built it.

445
00:26:19,972 --> 00:26:21,418
Speaker 0: you have the device installed in your car.

446
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:21,920
Speaker 0: be pretty easy.

447
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:24,352
Speaker 1: I need a bunch of people.

448
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:29,578
Speaker 1: it would have to be like no Conspiracy just means conspiring to xxx.

449
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:32,931
Speaker 1: But then I can't understand how that would be illegal.

450
00:26:32,951 --> 00:26:33,172
Speaker 1: if what?

451
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:38,552
Speaker 1: if I conspire to do it and then don't do it Can you still and you prove that I did that conspiring without the doing?

452
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:40,720
Speaker 1: it depends on you then that's bullshit.

453
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,752
Speaker 0: They recently arrested a guy for buying this.

454
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:44,876
Speaker 0: There's a fart story about this.

455
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:45,860
Speaker 0: I don't know where it'll end up.

456
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:54,833
Speaker 0: He bought a whole bunch of matches a whole bunch of fuel and Suda Fedron Rested him for conspiracy to make meth amphetamines.

457
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:56,180
Speaker 1: He was think but did he make the meth?

458
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,403
Speaker 1: No, then he.

459
00:26:57,603 --> 00:26:57,884
Speaker 1: how could?

460
00:26:57,904 --> 00:27:00,271
Speaker 1: that's bullshit felony bullshit felony.

461
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:00,974
Speaker 1: I call bullshit.

462
00:27:01,174 --> 00:27:03,060
Speaker 1: I call felony innocent to proven guilty.

463
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,662
Speaker 1: He didn't do.

464
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:05,329
Speaker 0: I'm not saying what's right or wrong.

465
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:06,916
Speaker 0: I'm saying what I would do to you.

466
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:11,694
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what, mr James Bond I'm thinking about making meth right now.

467
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:13,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

468
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:23,784
Speaker 0: I think they got him on some sort of having the will and the means and Follow-up story and Fark pointed out that they found an old story saying that the same guy was arrested for making meth a couple of Times in the past.

469
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:25,775
Speaker 1: I'm not saying the guy was definitely gonna make math.

470
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:28,060
Speaker 0: There's no but I Don't know.

471
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:34,300
Speaker 0: All I'm saying Scott is that if there's a will there's a way to get a felony conviction.

472
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:41,769
Speaker 1: What if I go to the store and I buy a but you sound like men who were like, oh You want to implement this fancy technology?

473
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:42,070
Speaker 1: Yeah.

474
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:44,100
Speaker 0: What if I'm an old man, and I can't figure it out.

475
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,207
Speaker 0: Where's your technology now?

476
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:46,696
Speaker 1: No, this isn't what if I'm an old man?

477
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:46,978
Speaker 1: I'm on.

478
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,714
Speaker 1: figure out It's what if I'm a young man and your technology doesn't work on speakers.

479
00:27:50,975 --> 00:27:52,783
Speaker 0: They got away with shit for a while That's right.

480
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,453
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna be toll freakers.

481
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:57,785
Speaker 0: Yeah, a Much better strategies.

482
00:27:57,825 --> 00:27:59,171
Speaker 0: have a license plate that turns the.

483
00:27:59,372 --> 00:28:01,180
Speaker 1: oh, oh, I got a better idea.

484
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,980
Speaker 1: We hack the system to where it takes a picture.

485
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,265
Speaker 1: But you actually like you.

486
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,920
Speaker 1: you actually just put in the database a picture of like a penis don't see?

487
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,835
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like the cock boat license plate.

488
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:19,796
Speaker 0: exactly Things of the day.

489
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:24,370
Speaker 0: so if you like X cop or Dr.

490
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:25,657
Speaker 0: McNinja, who doesn't?

491
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:28,189
Speaker 0: you will like the other of both of those?

492
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,392
Speaker 1: Who doesn't?

493
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,810
Speaker 0: and if you like best karate for the gentleman?

494
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,388
Speaker 0: You'll probably like both of them as well.

495
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:34,394
Speaker 0: There's this kind of.

496
00:28:35,058 --> 00:28:40,627
Speaker 0: if you if the title of any of those three things Sounds like a thing you would like you will like all three of those things.

497
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:41,190
Speaker 0: That's right.

498
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:50,238
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is that X cop which is a wonderful comic about a cop who finds an axe and becomes X cop Someone made a short fan film.

499
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:53,950
Speaker 0: It's more of a kind of a trailer for what would be the X cop movie.

500
00:28:54,872 --> 00:29:04,288
Speaker 0: The guy they got looks exactly like X guys a little smaller though But otherwise, he looks exactly like a smaller X cop is like 40 feet tall and made of radiation.

501
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:04,809
Speaker 0: That's right.

502
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:08,822
Speaker 0: It's pretty damn good and pretty high production value.

503
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:10,950
Speaker 1: No, except for dinosaur cops mask.

504
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,589
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm gonna email these guys and be like what HD camera do you use?

505
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,652
Speaker 0: Can I buy?

506
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,757
Speaker 0: should I just buy that one?

507
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:17,942
Speaker 0: I don't know.

508
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:21,201
Speaker 0: Yeah you people in the forum I've been looking for an HD camera.

509
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:22,328
Speaker 0: But anyway, that's inside.

510
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:27,650
Speaker 1: All right It's been a while since we've used a hockey fight as a thing and remember hockey fight week.

511
00:29:28,112 --> 00:29:39,310
Speaker 1: So here on a January 26, which is just a few days ago Zach's door teeny and Chris Bartsch of the Dallas Stars and Edmonton Oilers got into a big fight down in Dallas.

512
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:49,510
Speaker 0: Now the my favorite part until I noticed the part that's Scott's real thing of the day was that Basically, they turn to each other and then as soon as they start to fight there is an explosion of gloves.

513
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:50,154
Speaker 1: I love that.

514
00:29:50,174 --> 00:29:51,605
Speaker 0: just BAM in all directions.

515
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:52,270
Speaker 1: That's the greatest.

516
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:54,237
Speaker 1: Anyway, so there's a glove explosion.

517
00:29:54,318 --> 00:29:57,690
Speaker 1: that good old hockey fight and quite a good, you know, very very good hockey fight.

518
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, they keep going at it.

519
00:29:59,116 --> 00:30:00,241
Speaker 1: They're getting real tired.

520
00:30:00,261 --> 00:30:02,470
Speaker 0: guy in the black jersey is clearly winning this thing.

521
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:14,882
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, the thing is about this fight is there's some music playing right do Do and if you are a nerd you will know exactly what music this is.

522
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:15,143
Speaker 0: it is.

523
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:16,908
Speaker 0: In fact the NSM be theme song.

524
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:23,129
Speaker 0: Yes Anyway, that's that's some inside baseball for you.

525
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you're listening to this to the song going on.

526
00:30:27,512 --> 00:30:33,350
Speaker 1: But what's really interesting is that at first I thought this music was being added after the fact by YouTube.

527
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,785
Speaker 1: Right because you watch anything on YouTube and there's always music, you know overlaid this music.

528
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:49,468
Speaker 1: I guarantee you I know for a fact is being played in the arena, you know somewhere there's an intern in Dallas in Dallas Who had that?

529
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:49,951
Speaker 0: mp3.

530
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:54,381
Speaker 0: just Waiting and waiting and waiting for a fight.

531
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:58,990
Speaker 0: that was long enough and worthy enough of it and he had play on that thing And he sat there arms crossed.

532
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:07,269
Speaker 1: That was probably the highlight of his year and every nerd in the Dallas hockey arena watching stars fan was like, oh fuck.

533
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:10,870
Speaker 0: Yes Actually, this is a self-serving thing of the day.

534
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:17,979
Speaker 0: I gotta find the old audio but remember at RIT when I made that clip from the Beavis and Butthead movie And I gave it to the corner crew guy.

535
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:20,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then they played it during the shutout game.

536
00:31:20,491 --> 00:31:22,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was my crowning glory.

537
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:29,222
Speaker 0: The only thing we never got him to play was the tiger tiger song.

538
00:31:29,523 --> 00:31:31,209
Speaker 0: that's right, so yeah.

539
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:41,104
Speaker 0: So before we get into it the meta moment the book club book is Michio Kaku's hyperspace Which I just I'm 90% through it and I'm 10%.

540
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:42,770
Speaker 0: I can say one thing hyperspace.

541
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,016
Speaker 1: I've been playing DS games.

542
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,724
Speaker 0: I hadn't read it since I was a little kid.

543
00:31:45,844 --> 00:31:47,030
Speaker 0: It's talks about the fourth dimension.

544
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:49,001
Speaker 0: It's kind of like Carl Sagan.

545
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:53,277
Speaker 0: Yay science, but it's all about Multidimensional string theory quantum mechanics.

546
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:55,546
Speaker 1: The only thing I want to know is like this book is kind of.

547
00:31:55,606 --> 00:31:58,449
Speaker 1: it's not old old But it's you know, it's it's years old.

548
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:04,226
Speaker 1: It means how is this still mostly what you you know theoretical physicists think?

549
00:32:04,326 --> 00:32:09,210
Speaker 0: or is there new things that say Right, I was looking online and a lot of it is still pretty solid.

550
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:10,338
Speaker 0: All right, a lot of it.

551
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,890
Speaker 0: But anyway, we'll talk about it when we talk.

552
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:17,263
Speaker 1: I would like I would like for someone Timo someone who is a physicist to tell us which parts are not solid.

553
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:22,583
Speaker 0: thing is a lot of his history like after a while It's like alright, so you're with us on this, you know Einstein stuff.

554
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:24,450
Speaker 0: All right, what all quantum mechanics?

555
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,443
Speaker 0: That's just a big fat middle finger to Einstein.

556
00:32:27,483 --> 00:32:28,127
Speaker 0: What about now?

557
00:32:28,187 --> 00:32:28,649
Speaker 0: what now?

558
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,319
Speaker 0: Doesn't this go against everything we're talking about?

559
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:43,787
Speaker 0: So the book goes a lot of good directions But I mentioned it only because I made it my book club book and now having read it again It is scary how much that book influenced my young science interest.

560
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:47,643
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Almost everything I cared about as a kid came from hyperspace.

561
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:48,747
Speaker 1: That's interesting.

562
00:32:48,848 --> 00:32:53,470
Speaker 1: Yeah Also in meta news PAX East is very soon.

563
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,798
Speaker 0: We are doing not one not two not three But five panels.

564
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,586
Speaker 1: only three of them are combined into one.

565
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:01,370
Speaker 1: So it's really three.

566
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:04,324
Speaker 0: We're doing game mechanics and mechanism design again due to popular.

567
00:33:04,364 --> 00:33:05,450
Speaker 1: Do you really need to list them all?

568
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:06,981
Speaker 0: We'll list them all later.

569
00:33:07,183 --> 00:33:07,950
Speaker 0: We'll list them on Tuesday.

570
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:13,670
Speaker 1: We should go to PAX East but the week following PAX East is Zenkai con in Pennsylvania somewhere.

571
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:15,076
Speaker 0: It's a growing anime con.

572
00:33:15,096 --> 00:33:16,381
Speaker 0: We'll be there doing a whole bunch of stuff.

573
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:18,109
Speaker 1: It's sort of the kazukan replacement for us.

574
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:27,804
Speaker 0: Yep Also, uh that the weekend coming up two weekends from now February 10th or February 11th on Friday is a nerd NYC board game night.

575
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,777
Speaker 0: We will be there Playing board games.

576
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:31,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have a lot of listeners showing up.

577
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,820
Speaker 0: It's turning into more and more of a geek nights meet up.

578
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,830
Speaker 1: So if you it's like every week there's like one listener.

579
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,697
Speaker 1: There's like whoa weird.

580
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's always a different listener, too.

581
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:38,630
Speaker 0: Yeah.

582
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:53,570
Speaker 0: so if you want to meet us and you live in the greater New York City area and you come to think coffee on Fridays when they had their nerd NYC board game nights We are there playing board games and you can totally play a board game with us unless you smell.

583
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,045
Speaker 1: Also, we have a website for our crew.

584
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:56,890
Speaker 1: calm go to it.

585
00:33:57,251 --> 00:33:59,599
Speaker 1: We have an email address geek nights a front recruit.

586
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:00,462
Speaker 1: calm email us.

587
00:34:00,703 --> 00:34:01,766
Speaker 1: We have Twitter.

00:34:01,786 --> 00:34:02,710
Speaker 1: geek nights.

589
00:34:03,212 --> 00:34:06,510
Speaker 0: We have a forum that has a sort of forum explosion going on yet again, right?

590
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:12,909
Speaker 1: And also the people in the forum have made their own unofficial geek nights IRC channel, which is on free node.

591
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,464
Speaker 0: It is unsanctioned, but I give it my thumbs up.

592
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:16,389
Speaker 0: wink and nod.

593
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:21,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz people always like Scott, you know, we need a. you know, why don't you make like a geek nights wiki?

594
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,929
Speaker 1: I'm like, why don't you make you dance wiki?

595
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:24,696
Speaker 1: So they're like Scott.

596
00:34:24,716 --> 00:34:25,743
Speaker 1: We want a geek nice chat room.

597
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:26,830
Speaker 1: Like why do you make a nice chair?

598
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:27,675
Speaker 1: So they finally did.

599
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:31,538
Speaker 0: I mean I made the geek nights Counter-Strike server But why do I have to make everything?

600
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:34,170
Speaker 0: the server powered itself off and won't power back on?

601
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:34,591
Speaker 0: I won't.

602
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,724
Speaker 1: I won't say it's official but I mean it does.

603
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:40,469
Speaker 1: so there's not an official chat room But it's a geek nice chat room.

604
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,259
Speaker 0: Yeah If you want to chat one of you listeners makes a geek nights thing.

605
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:46,507
Speaker 0: that is super popular and we decide to make the for real thing.

606
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:50,090
Speaker 0: Obviously you will be the moderator and administrator of it if you want.

607
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:56,750
Speaker 1: Because the main reason I don't want to make an official thing is cuz that means I got to take care of Unofficial, I don't got to do shit.

608
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:02,855
Speaker 0: It's like I said the geek nights Counter-Strike server powered off like a couple weeks ago and won't boot and I got to figure out What's wrong with it?

609
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:04,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the power supply died.

610
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:11,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, feel free to make as many unofficial geek nights things or front row crew things as you want as long as they're unofficial.

611
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:13,655
Speaker 1: You know, I don't really care.

612
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,744
Speaker 0: Well that by nature could not be official.

613
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:20,082
Speaker 1: unless we officialize then I mean think you know, that's what every community on the internet does right.

614
00:35:20,142 --> 00:35:24,420
Speaker 1: if you go to say something awful forums There's a something awful minecraft server.

615
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,395
Speaker 1: I'm sure but that's not run by something awful It's just by people in the community.

616
00:35:28,455 --> 00:35:32,969
Speaker 1: make the something awful, you know community minecraft servers, you know, that's how it works.

617
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,730
Speaker 0: Do note however that we retain all trademark rights to geek nights and front row crew.

618
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:41,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, just as an aside if you get big enough, we're gonna make you sign a licensing agreement.

619
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:45,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think we can sue an IRC channel for using pound geek nights as its channel name.

620
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:51,265
Speaker 0: Cover my bases because I'm not a lawyer and I don't want to do most.

621
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:56,261
Speaker 1: at the worst-case scenario We could write the free node an email and then they would give.

622
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:58,327
Speaker 1: make us the op of the channel instead of them.

623
00:35:58,347 --> 00:36:03,632
Speaker 0: So Egypt we're not gonna talk about Egypt just yet We could.

624
00:36:03,853 --> 00:36:12,110
Speaker 0: I have a feeling once this has resolved itself somewhat We will do a Thursday show on Egypt because I have a lot of say that I've been following this pretty much continuously.

625
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,799
Speaker 0: I'm very interested in the outcome.

626
00:36:13,819 --> 00:36:30,809
Speaker 0: I'm with those kids, but Independently one very specific issue came up that resonated throughout geekly circles because a very similar issue at least on the surface has been Making the rounds in America among nerds and people are afraid of it.

627
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:37,250
Speaker 0: So remember when Obama and the administration and the government kept saying we need an a quote internet kill switch.

628
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,855
Speaker 1: Well, they still want one up.

629
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:43,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, they want one pretty badly and there's debate as to what internet kill switch means.

630
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:56,930
Speaker 0: But we have seen the what an internet kill switch could be in Egypt because Egypt for those of you don't know This is a largely popular movement that kind of came out of social media and hit the real world.

631
00:36:57,251 --> 00:37:02,227
Speaker 0: Because the youth are not stupid and that you know, they can communicate and say we're done at this bullshit.

632
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:03,290
Speaker 0: Let's get together.

633
00:37:03,532 --> 00:37:08,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, every time I look at footage of any Egyptian protests or anything there are more cell phone.

634
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:18,525
Speaker 1: Everyone's got blackberries and cell phones taking pictures of everything uploading the videos to YouTube Everybody's all over that shit tweet in Facebook and everything.

635
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:21,980
Speaker 1: right now granted There's a lot of fake Facebook in it, but this plenty is.

636
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,823
Speaker 1: there's a lot of real.

637
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:26,715
Speaker 0: so Egypt basically Couldn't deal with these protests.

638
00:37:26,836 --> 00:37:31,230
Speaker 0: and shortly after all this began they shut down everything they Madagascar to the internet.

639
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:36,924
Speaker 0: They literally turned off telecommunications in almost the entire nation of Egypt, but here's the thing is.

640
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:41,589
Speaker 1: not only did they turn off the Internets, but they turned it off phones.

641
00:37:41,771 --> 00:37:44,241
Speaker 1: They turned it off in a really clever way.

642
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:50,850
Speaker 1: like they managed to turn it off like, you know They're apparently I was reading there are some other countries that route their traffic through Egypt.

643
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:52,596
Speaker 1: They're still routing to them.

644
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:54,082
Speaker 1: Like this was something.

645
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:56,390
Speaker 1: had smart Cisco people do this, right?

646
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:00,730
Speaker 1: Maybe they paid Cisco themselves to do it because Cisco well has no problems doing that kind of shit.

647
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,632
Speaker 0: You're interested in that.

648
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:17,743
Speaker 0: pay attention to anonymous because at least one group claiming to be anonymous which means they are effectively anonymous is Trying to piece together all the technology that they used to then Scream how far and wide at the companies who allowed this bullshit to take

649
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:18,867
Speaker 1: all Cisco does the same?

650
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:19,870
Speaker 1: does the bullshit in China?

651
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's probably you know them but it basically they were modifying routing tables and this sorts of stuff.

652
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,031
Speaker 1: They weren't.

653
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:29,690
Speaker 1: just you know, some other country or probably just go and cut all the cables and that would be that right?

654
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,233
Speaker 0: But but think about this.

655
00:38:31,253 --> 00:38:32,457
Speaker 0: this is kind of an aside.

656
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:48,090
Speaker 0: but Egypt the government that was probably the worst miscalculation they could ever have made because they saw that social media was really driving this and They turned off the internet and then that actually made the protests bigger not smaller.

657
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:50,580
Speaker 1: This is the one mistake that I always keep pointing out.

658
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,070
Speaker 1: is like everyone all these countries are so stupid.

659
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:59,230
Speaker 1: They take the 1984 approach and the problem with the 1984 approach is that it is obvious everyone can see it.

660
00:38:59,391 --> 00:39:08,325
Speaker 1: It's like, you know You look at like pictures of like Al Jazeera versus Egyptian state television where it shows like no one protesting and just cops standing at an empty street.

661
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:13,130
Speaker 1: and it's like yeah Captain obvious we see what you did there, right?

662
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,315
Speaker 1: You're not fooling anybody.

663
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:19,863
Speaker 0: if you want to fool everyone you have to do the u.s Trick which is have all the free speech you want.

664
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:20,647
Speaker 1: Hahaha.

665
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:22,718
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter You don't actually doesn't amount to anything.

666
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,870
Speaker 0: but think about this from a more direct level.

667
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:31,009
Speaker 0: So there's a large angry growing movement demanding the downfall of the government and democracy and all this stuff.

668
00:39:31,851 --> 00:39:38,448
Speaker 0: So they turn off the biggest circus in the world to a nation that already doesn't have enough bread.

669
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:39,934
Speaker 1: no bread No circuses.

670
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:42,005
Speaker 1: All right, we're gonna even less circuses.

671
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:42,870
Speaker 1: No, that was stupid.

672
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:50,838
Speaker 1: You gotta add if you added bread or circuses, that would make when you turn off phones and the internet Even grandma's getting pissed now.

673
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:51,560
Speaker 1: That's right.

674
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,744
Speaker 1: There was another country.

675
00:39:52,784 --> 00:39:53,165
Speaker 1: I read that.

676
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:54,610
Speaker 1: well, I gave money to everybody.

677
00:39:55,277 --> 00:39:55,581
Speaker 1: I don't know.

678
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,370
Speaker 1: I forget what it was.

679
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:02,749
Speaker 1: I don't know it might have not been true, but I read something about some country giving money to everybody Because you know or something like that.

680
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was something in Kuwait, let me look it up.

681
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:07,262
Speaker 1: you keep talking.

682
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,847
Speaker 0: are you sure it was something?

683
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:10,772
Speaker 0: are you sure it wasn't Nothing.

684
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:11,414
Speaker 0: Hold on.

685
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:12,036
Speaker 1: I'm looking it up.

686
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:12,457
Speaker 1: you talk.

687
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:19,770
Speaker 0: All right, so they tried to shut down the whole internet and they succeeded and It had no effect on the protests effectively.

688
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:30,149
Speaker 0: But at the same time that is a really I don't believe that the US government should have any ability to Dictate any sort of internet thing like that.

689
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:46,690
Speaker 0: The government should have no way to shut down our internet because I cannot imagine any Possible way that that could protect us more than individual entity entities Working to protect their own networks in the event of some sort of scary so-called cyber attack.

690
00:40:47,693 --> 00:40:51,244
Speaker 1: I can't actually find a an actual news article about this.

691
00:40:51,304 --> 00:40:51,725
Speaker 1: quite things.

692
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:53,370
Speaker 1: It was probably just a tweet or something.

693
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,898
Speaker 1: Oh, no, wait wait for it.

694
00:40:54,978 --> 00:40:55,561
Speaker 1: Oh, no Ron.

695
00:40:55,601 --> 00:41:01,883
Speaker 1: Nevermind regard was probably bullshit But yeah, if you want people to stop protesting you had to be nice to them.

696
00:41:01,924 --> 00:41:03,850
Speaker 1: You can't be obviously mean to them.

697
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,003
Speaker 1: This is gonna make them angrier and it definitely that's what happened.

698
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:08,770
Speaker 1: I could have told you that it's the other thing.

699
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:13,958
Speaker 0: I have a more kind of wide aspect of this kind of a wider view because well I want to talk about technologies.

700
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:15,530
Speaker 1: Like what do you do when they cut off the Internet?

701
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,098
Speaker 0: Well, I was thinking about this from Egypt.

702
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:17,962
Speaker 0: What did they do?

703
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:29,119
Speaker 0: They already had critical mass So the mass just coordinated itself with the good old-fashioned means of posters and flyers and Sneaker-net and walking around and shouting from the rooftops.

704
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,763
Speaker 1: Yeah megaphones, right?

705
00:41:31,145 --> 00:41:33,030
Speaker 1: But you know that doesn't replace internet.

706
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:37,377
Speaker 0: Well in an urban culture It can and can for this.

707
00:41:37,718 --> 00:41:47,342
Speaker 0: if you've gotten to the point of going out into the streets and not leaving then You don't need the internet anymore Especially if you're having multiple simultaneous demonstration plus

708
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:51,082
Speaker 1: anything that you're gonna record is gonna be You can put it on the internet later and

709
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:52,110
Speaker 0: you can't stop satellite.

710
00:41:52,331 --> 00:41:55,890
Speaker 0: Someone's gonna get the signal out because look they cut off the internet.

711
00:41:56,332 --> 00:41:57,837
Speaker 0: We still know what's going on.

712
00:41:57,877 --> 00:42:00,005
Speaker 0: The rest of the world knows you can't hide this shit.

713
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:08,570
Speaker 1: satellite dishes can't be V Ham radio ham radio can't be V. Yeah, you know plus look even in for example, North Korea, right geography.

714
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:12,590
Speaker 1: So you go to the border near China and you can pick up a cell tower.

715
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:14,900
Speaker 1: There's actually cell towers there on purpose.

716
00:42:15,162 --> 00:42:16,910
Speaker 0: Look at what happened in Cuba.

717
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:20,465
Speaker 0: There's a black market and USB sticks with copies of Wikipedia on them.

718
00:42:20,686 --> 00:42:25,126
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I think I made that a thing of the day a long time ago.

719
00:42:25,428 --> 00:42:25,930
Speaker 1: That's awesome.

720
00:42:26,273 --> 00:42:27,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, USB underground.

721
00:42:27,704 --> 00:42:32,046
Speaker 0: and in North Korea There's supposedly a USB underground of South Korean pop dramas.

722
00:42:32,328 --> 00:42:38,139
Speaker 1: plus, you know You look at my thing of the day from last Thursday, right the pirate box Which we're gonna be making use of very soon.

723
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:38,963
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

724
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:40,390
Speaker 0: I'm excited about my pirate box.

725
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:52,801
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know you set some of those up and suddenly you've got a you know a wireless Egyptian Intranet and then as soon as there's internet again You just get those pirate boxes on the internet and then I'll snap.

726
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:55,048
Speaker 0: the pirate box is just the first salvo.

727
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:55,650
Speaker 0: and what will eventually?

728
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,170
Speaker 0: Be the thing that I talk about all the time.

729
00:42:57,512 --> 00:43:06,610
Speaker 0: what if we could make for the same money that we're making this pirate box now a Pirate box that also has the option of just finding other pirate boxes making a mesh communications network?

730
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:10,010
Speaker 1: Well, I mean this already is sort of small mesh networking, right?

731
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:11,074
Speaker 1: And we can.

732
00:43:11,234 --> 00:43:16,030
Speaker 1: there's sort of like this ham radio packet routing that you can do if you buy these device.

733
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:17,708
Speaker 0: All that stuff is slow as shit.

734
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:31,210
Speaker 0: However in a situation like this getting video out and getting you know video around and the kind of internet stuff We do as important as that is What's actually important to a movement or a resistance is?

735
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,285
Speaker 0: Text and we can send a lot of text with very low bandwidth.

736
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:36,650
Speaker 1: The other thing we can do, right?

737
00:43:36,894 --> 00:43:40,056
Speaker 0: Serval Wireless networking mechanism.

738
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:40,177
Speaker 0: There

739
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:53,550
Speaker 1: have been plenty of instances of nerds setting up their own GSM network So we could easily get all the AT&T and T-Mobile phones at least You know texting each other for free on some sort of you know, nerd network of kinds

740
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:54,232
Speaker 0: Yeah,

741
00:43:54,473 --> 00:43:55,819
Speaker 1: and the other thing is right.

742
00:43:55,979 --> 00:43:58,630
Speaker 1: if you're talking about a situation where they turned off the internet, right?

743
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:04,130
Speaker 1: This is likely there is a lot less is a lawless situation, you know or much much less law.

744
00:44:04,713 --> 00:44:05,939
Speaker 0: Forget all that America.

745
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:08,170
Speaker 0: It's pretty easy to get around this in the long run.

746
00:44:08,255 --> 00:44:08,731
Speaker 0: Yeah one of the.

747
00:44:08,751 --> 00:44:14,879
Speaker 0: imagine if the internet got shut down like right now like we're sitting here and suddenly there's no internet at All and like I can't.

748
00:44:14,899 --> 00:44:31,950
Speaker 0: my cell phone doesn't get an internet anything So I call some of my friends and and I can't get through to anyone After about a day of that and me, you know using sneaker net to find out that Nobody has internet like only the Northeast power outage and I found out through hook and crook that nobody had power.

749
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:37,690
Speaker 0: Once I figure out that that is due to the government I am in the streets.

750
00:44:38,755 --> 00:44:47,710
Speaker 1: No, but what I'm saying here is that you know The main thing that keeps us from having our own internet right now that it's not controlled by any government or company.

751
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:55,413
Speaker 1: Right is the FCC which regulates and controls which frequency Situation.

752
00:44:55,433 --> 00:44:56,315
Speaker 1: that shit don't matter.

753
00:44:56,335 --> 00:45:01,430
Speaker 1: So up go big ass antennas go to the grocery store empty out the food cans make the cantanas.

754
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,890
Speaker 0: That's why what I would advocate is that nerds should make one of the RFC.

755
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:16,413
Speaker 1: Every nerd should make big antennas that are illegal now and get and just test them out Make sure you don't get busted and then put them in the closet and then if shit ever happens Bust out your antenna.

756
00:45:16,473 --> 00:45:20,784
Speaker 0: now the good nerds need to get together and make RFCs and come up with protocols.

757
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:28,294
Speaker 0: and means that basically assuming Mad Max or at least assuming internet Mad Max What like?

758
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:30,945
Speaker 0: how quickly can the nerds make radio free world?

759
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:32,210
Speaker 0: here's how you do your free earth.

760
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:32,854
Speaker 1: Here's how you do it.

761
00:45:32,894 --> 00:45:33,135
Speaker 1: ready.

762
00:45:33,256 --> 00:45:35,187
Speaker 1: You take the DD wrt firmware.

763
00:45:35,327 --> 00:45:40,693
Speaker 1: you add you know mesh network end of the world mode to it and You know, you can.

764
00:45:40,713 --> 00:45:45,810
Speaker 1: you basically pop the antennas off your router attach your cantanas or whatever other badass antenna you're gonna make.

765
00:45:46,191 --> 00:45:48,377
Speaker 0: That's a pretty gross oversimplification.

766
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:57,084
Speaker 0: You need something more robust because if you use barely commodity stuff like that It'd be pretty trivial for a government that was pissed off enough to just block everything.

767
00:45:57,465 --> 00:45:58,649
Speaker 0: what you both at least block.

768
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:03,949
Speaker 1: you What you know, obviously we can make more advanced stuff too, but you need to have something that any nerd can do.

769
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:11,849
Speaker 0: nerds need to write a protocol and come up with an open standard that would be totally illegal to actually use but would work.

770
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,897
Speaker 0: some Sort of spread spectrum high-powered.

771
00:46:15,097 --> 00:46:24,380
Speaker 0: We don't give a shit about what else we screw up radio system that if it's running is Basically, it's mutually assured destruction for the government to jam it.

772
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:29,842
Speaker 0: they would have to jam everything including themselves including the numbers stations.

773
00:46:29,862 --> 00:46:30,729
Speaker 0: the numbers stations.

774
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:35,040
Speaker 0: Nerd should make some numbers stations, but that's a pretty sure nerds do make.

775
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,461
Speaker 1: the numbers.

776
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:46,328
Speaker 0: take one one one one But zoom out a little bit because we could get into the specific tech and that would almost be a separate show of like.

777
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:48,617
Speaker 0: very Specifically, how would we route around?

778
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:51,729
Speaker 0: but the wider issue is that look what's happening in the Middle East?

779
00:46:52,910 --> 00:47:12,036
Speaker 0: these isolated protests spread throughout numerous countries and the only common theme is that there are people who want Liberalized political systems, even if they do not want liberalism They don't necessarily want to have this kind of open free Western society But they want political freedom.

780
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:16,521
Speaker 0: and that's this kind of core meme that's spread in a way They could never spread before.

781
00:47:16,622 --> 00:47:18,654
Speaker 0: social media I think caused all of this.

782
00:47:18,674 --> 00:47:24,670
Speaker 0: hmm the same level of dissidents would not cause this in many nations simultaneously a long time ago.

783
00:47:24,851 --> 00:47:39,677
Speaker 1: I think what it is is that you know, I have the feeling, you know people anyone in America no matter which side They're on right all of us whether you're right or left or up or down or sideways everyone's dissatisfied about something and Dissatisfaction always outweighs the satisfaction.

784
00:47:39,717 --> 00:47:40,259
Speaker 1: because they take.

785
00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:43,970
Speaker 1: four people tend to take for granted the things they're satisfied about right?

786
00:47:44,592 --> 00:47:50,690
Speaker 1: But the things they're dissatisfied about, you know, if the only problem we had in the entire United States that the DMV had long lines.

787
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:54,810
Speaker 1: People would just be like on Fox News or whatever news station.

788
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:58,130
Speaker 1: They would be like the long line of the DMV to be reporters day with cameras.

789
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,938
Speaker 1: you know everything else in the country is perfect.

790
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:08,530
Speaker 0: or at Maslow's Pyramid if the if the thing Like if there is a thing that's broken that's low enough level to where everybody no matter how much they hate each other all agree.

791
00:48:08,691 --> 00:48:16,490
Speaker 0: I mean look Islamic extremists and Liberal secular youths all agree that the current regime has to go right.

792
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:21,590
Speaker 1: But the thing is people are generally always pissed off at government no matter how perfect the government is, right?

793
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:22,293
Speaker 1: There's no way.

794
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:23,518
Speaker 1: everyone is always.

795
00:48:23,538 --> 00:48:26,030
Speaker 1: no one likes any government no matter what the government is.

796
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,702
Speaker 1: Find me a place time in history country where people are going.

797
00:48:29,983 --> 00:48:30,263
Speaker 1: Yay.

798
00:48:30,364 --> 00:48:31,527
Speaker 1: Our government is so great.

799
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:32,330
Speaker 1: We love living here.

800
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,155
Speaker 1: This is wonderful.

801
00:48:33,195 --> 00:48:34,120
Speaker 1: There's no problem.

802
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,990
Speaker 1: I don't hate any politicians or presidents.

803
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:36,977
Speaker 1: I want all.

804
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,850
Speaker 1: I want to vote for all of them over again and again.

805
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:39,754
Speaker 1: Everything is great.

806
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:40,799
Speaker 1: Never happened.

807
00:48:40,819 --> 00:48:41,281
Speaker 1: Never will happen.

808
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:42,125
Speaker 0: Are you talking about?

809
00:48:42,406 --> 00:48:42,968
Speaker 0: in Cuba?

810
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:45,353
Speaker 0: I mean 90% they're.

811
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:47,260
Speaker 0: just there's landslide elections.

812
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in Egypt - yeah, everyone's happy same kind.

813
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:55,350
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the fact is is that why if that's the case that people are always dissatisfied.

814
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:58,910
Speaker 1: People would always be in revolution right because everyone's pissed off.

815
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:03,894
Speaker 1: So they would have a revolution and then as soon as they're pissed off again, which wouldn't be that long Revolution again, right?

816
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:05,138
Speaker 1: Why doesn't that happen?

817
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:10,074
Speaker 1: It's because people aren't angry enough degree of anger Not to get mad.

818
00:49:10,134 --> 00:49:17,609
Speaker 1: and also how much do you believe that the revolution will work and it's worth your effort Right, which a lot of that has to do with unemployment also?

819
00:49:17,692 --> 00:49:20,383
Speaker 1: Yeah well if you don't have to go to work then you can be in a revolution.

820
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:32,962
Speaker 0: if you have a job you're not going to sell tales back in what I was saying because look the thing Tunisia had its rising up and it was relatively successful and Discontents in neighboring nations basically were like we can do that too.

821
00:49:33,363 --> 00:49:34,225
Speaker 0: We might win.

822
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:39,029
Speaker 1: So what the thing is is that People did not believe that a revolution would work.

823
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:45,450
Speaker 1: But as you get the power of technology right coming in the power of the people is enhanced.

824
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,282
Speaker 1: You need an arm course, not it.

825
00:49:47,342 --> 00:49:48,449
Speaker 0: people were not armed.

826
00:49:48,871 --> 00:49:53,226
Speaker 0: Note that China is blocking the ever-living shit out of any news about Egypt or Tunisia.

827
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:53,929
Speaker 1: That's true, right?

828
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:59,230
Speaker 1: That's with good reason, but at least if you're you know want China to stay the way it is, right?

829
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:06,157
Speaker 1: It's you know, if you suddenly gave a whole country of angry people guns They would there's.

830
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:07,604
Speaker 1: they would suddenly have a revolution.

831
00:50:07,644 --> 00:50:08,970
Speaker 1: cuz now it's like we can take on the army.

832
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:09,659
Speaker 1: We got guns.

833
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,678
Speaker 0: on The Daily Show There was this graphic Johnston was talking about the Egyptian thing.

834
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:23,710
Speaker 0: when it first started he was like blah blah blah the nation of Egypt which Sits on top of and he puts up this graphic the world's largest untapped reserve of Islamist rage.

835
00:50:24,172 --> 00:50:29,535
Speaker 0: And he had this graphic of like sand bedrock oil Islamist rage.

836
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:31,566
Speaker 0: and it was just this pissed off looking guy.

837
00:50:31,586 --> 00:50:32,169
Speaker 1: That's right.

838
00:50:32,692 --> 00:50:43,661
Speaker 1: So anyway instead of giving these people guns we gave them all cell phones and internets Which is almost as powerful a weapon as guns Especially since it looks like the guns that are there.

839
00:50:43,702 --> 00:50:45,750
Speaker 1: the army isn't shooting them so they don't need guns.

840
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:48,301
Speaker 0: Well think about they got all the weapons a very different situation.

841
00:50:48,442 --> 00:50:51,879
Speaker 1: since it's not a violent conflict They don't need weapons.

842
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,110
Speaker 1: The cell phone is the most powerful weapon they have.

843
00:50:54,512 --> 00:50:58,330
Speaker 1: So taking away the internet was basically equivalent of gun control here.

844
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,112
Speaker 0: Well part of it was.

845
00:50:59,493 --> 00:51:07,903
Speaker 1: that's what made the people powerful enough to for them to believe that their revolution would work was seeing that It worked elsewhere and seeing that they could do the same thing.

846
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:12,070
Speaker 0: of course part of the difference here Was that like in Iran with the attempted Green Revolution?

847
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:19,350
Speaker 0: They could basically get people from the rural areas ban them together and just drive them in to quash it.

848
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:35,347
Speaker 0: But in Egypt the military is much more modern and the people in the military are much more Similar to the people who are protesting, you know, that's another thing is the Egyptian military is not made up You know, it's like the people in the military are also be.

849
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:36,010
Speaker 1: it's like America.

850
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:46,649
Speaker 0: Imagine if the the US, you know, New York City's in riots like we're in the streets Military comes out against the New Yorkers who are mad because there's no internet.

851
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:48,453
Speaker 0: and They're those people.

852
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:51,423
Speaker 0: they're from Wyoming and they also don't have internet.

853
00:51:51,604 --> 00:51:53,350
Speaker 1: They're also yeah, they're just they're not they're us.

854
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,518
Speaker 1: They're not like this other group of people.

855
00:51:55,558 --> 00:52:03,727
Speaker 1: that's you know, usually when you have militaries going against the people It's because you have a military class that is sort of above the regular people.

856
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:06,490
Speaker 1: They got better privileges They don't you know, they're not like the other people.

857
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:11,130
Speaker 1: So the military people are happy and well-fed and well-paid while the regular people are in the shitter.

858
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:15,470
Speaker 1: That's when you get militaries that are being all bad say Khmer Rouge kind of situation.

859
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:16,636
Speaker 0: that's why I'm excited about this.

860
00:52:16,656 --> 00:52:16,796
Speaker 0: whole.

861
00:52:16,836 --> 00:52:27,890
Speaker 0: technical outlets is the way the technology assisted this because Egypt's reaction is very much kind of Their admission that this kind of regime is fucked worldwide in the long run.

862
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:33,300
Speaker 0: Mmm, because you can't I mean you can't stop nerds Nope Unless you stop them all.

863
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:39,430
Speaker 0: and if you think is it's happening now There's no outside world for them to get the signal out to it might have petered out.

864
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,314
Speaker 0: It's happening now.

865
00:52:40,374 --> 00:52:48,150
Speaker 1: and the places where there is less stability like Tunisia But our total control of the government or more anger right like Egypt, right?

866
00:52:48,451 --> 00:52:53,050
Speaker 1: So as time goes on right the bar is only going to get lower.

867
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:58,710
Speaker 1: So places that are only kind of angry are gonna be like, oh, we're kind of angry, but we can totally go.

868
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:04,349
Speaker 1: Let's do it and it's only a matter of time before, you know, maybe in our lifetimes with the?

869
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:04,609
Speaker 1: u.s.

870
00:53:06,093 --> 00:53:20,030
Speaker 0: My take on it is more that throughout the Arab world I I'm starting to believe that there is in many places a silent majority that even if they're not necessarily Liberal or have any of our Western ideals and freedoms and maybe not want those things fully.

871
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:28,270
Speaker 0: They definitely want more political freedom and are generally dissatisfied with the brutal regimes that are on top of them.

872
00:53:28,832 --> 00:53:38,123
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of brutal regime is probably I mean, I imagine there are a lot of people who are kind of in public Yeah, sharia law and privately like man fuck this.

873
00:53:38,444 --> 00:53:40,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you think you know Saudi Arabia.

874
00:53:40,691 --> 00:53:46,275
Speaker 1: It's like you really think all those people like, you know love being ruled by a bunch of princes Really?

875
00:53:46,295 --> 00:53:47,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, and look at Egypt.

876
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:51,383
Speaker 0: I mean look at the stereotype of Egyptians to come over here in the clubs hanging out.

877
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:53,370
Speaker 0: look at Egyptian nightclubs in Egypt.

878
00:53:53,874 --> 00:53:55,790
Speaker 0: Those kids don't want to live under Sharia law.

879
00:53:55,870 --> 00:54:04,940
Speaker 0: hell no, but I feel like there's this kind of silent or frightened majority in much of the Arab world that Technology bit by bit is going to show those people.

880
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:05,422
Speaker 0: You know what.

881
00:54:05,924 --> 00:54:07,250
Speaker 0: you don't have to put up for this bullshit.

882
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:08,977
Speaker 0: Look in all those other countries.

883
00:54:09,017 --> 00:54:10,483
Speaker 0: those people stop putting up for the bullshit.

884
00:54:11,005 --> 00:54:21,513
Speaker 0: Mmm, and Iran has the interesting situation that There's this huge gap in generations because of the Iran-Iraq war and all the people who died Very rapidly.

885
00:54:21,674 --> 00:54:30,649
Speaker 0: all the people in power with the very conservative values are going to die of old age or become too old to maintain Power and then there's gonna be a huge gap and then a very large angry youth.

886
00:54:31,072 --> 00:54:34,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, look at we're waiting for the old people to die so we can use computers, right?

887
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:35,994
Speaker 0: They're waiting.

888
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:39,150
Speaker 1: they're waiting for the old people to die because the old people are too religious.

889
00:54:40,753 --> 00:54:44,854
Speaker 0: And even when they're religious, well, we'll see I think we've gone on long enough But I don't know.

890
00:54:44,894 --> 00:54:50,096
Speaker 0: the moral of this is you can't stop the signal and the pirate box is the first step toward Liberating the world.

891
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:51,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, we need to everyone.

892
00:54:51,182 --> 00:54:58,750
Speaker 1: we need to start working on You know some sort of antenna system that totally breaks all kinds of laws in the FCC, but we don't actually implement.

893
00:54:59,012 --> 00:55:01,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't use it until the time is right.

894
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:10,710
Speaker 0: So when the time is right everyone puts their antennas up or make the the separate internet or we make the Pirate boxes that do that that make the mesh network and then we do a Michael Moore thing.

895
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,602
Speaker 0: I remember Michael Moore air dropped all those TVs over Afghanistan.

896
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:16,790
Speaker 0: No, it was a long time ago It was a publicity stunt.

897
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:25,139
Speaker 0: but imagine a day when you know Iran the youth rise up again and We like mass the Western nation start mass producing.

898
00:55:25,179 --> 00:55:25,721
Speaker 0: just nerds.

899
00:55:26,102 --> 00:55:38,130
Speaker 0: every every five nerds get together and make one Mesh pirate box and just kind of ship it over and try to get it smuggled into Iran And then eventually the the nerds of Iran have their own network.

900
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, see that thing is if we tried to like mail these things to say Egypt, right?

901
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:45,550
Speaker 0: Oh, you mail plans and parts in streams that they can't cut off without cutting off.

902
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:50,028
Speaker 1: Right, but the thing is like if you tried to mail something to Egypt now, it's not getting there.

903
00:55:50,168 --> 00:55:50,550
Speaker 0: No, no.

904
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,730
Speaker 0: So you start smuggling these things into places like North Korea over time?

905
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:58,219
Speaker 1: Hmm North Korea's already had plenty of smuggled in.

906
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:01,409
Speaker 1: yep, those people are watching South Korean dramas on VHS.

907
00:56:02,052 --> 00:56:03,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just arrested a lot of people for it.

908
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:04,645
