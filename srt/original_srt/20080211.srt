1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,164
Speaker 1: It's Monday February 11th.

2
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:12,964
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:15,968
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:19,899
Speaker 1: wiki wiki wiki Patangs.

5
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:25,767
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:31,270
Speaker 1: So at work right I'm in charge of this big wiki project.

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,068
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get all our data into some wiki's for documentation purposes and all that business.

8
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:38,499
Speaker 1: the thing that I've pretty much told every company.

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,248
Speaker 1: I've ever worked at would be a good idea.

10
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:43,144
Speaker 1: and finally I'm at a company that they're like yes do this.

11
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:43,848
Speaker 1: It sounds great.

12
00:00:43,888 --> 00:00:44,250
Speaker 1: Go ahead.

13
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:53,160
Speaker 1: So uh one of the problems I ran into was that media wiki and every other wiki is okay But they're all also kind of crappy.

14
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:56,416
Speaker 0: well the thing is they They have probably.

15
00:00:56,436 --> 00:01:05,850
Speaker 0: you know media wiki is probably the best wiki But they all have problems and none of them really have sort of these big features that people need if they're using them seriously.

16
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:09,881
Speaker 1: And the thing is though the real problem is that right now.

17
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:12,150
Speaker 1: I'm using Twiki which is a pretty good wiki.

18
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:21,850
Speaker 1: I'd say that Twiki and media wiki are some of the best and most useful ones, but Twiki is based on flat files as many wiki systems are and media wiki is based on databases.

19
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:29,762
Speaker 1: I will submit that the latter is a much better way of handling things But regardless I got Twiki's all right.

20
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:34,570
Speaker 1: if it's in a corporate environment I can't just have one Twiki or one wiki.

21
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,670
Speaker 1: I should have two you know like the main one and then kind of the backup one the disaster recovery one.

22
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,939
Speaker 0: They couldn't use have a wiki cluster that way.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,646
Speaker 1: Oh, yes a wiki cluster.

24
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,650
Speaker 1: That would be fantastic.

25
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:45,958
Speaker 1: How am I going to do that?

26
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,730
Speaker 0: you just have you know you know what?

27
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,750
Speaker 0: What do you what do you do?

28
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,160
Speaker 0: You know you don't cluster the wiki software itself.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,253
Speaker 0: you use the cluster with the underlying Apache MySQL stack and then you put the wiki on top of it And it just works.

30
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:01,270
Speaker 1: now because the wiki is not in any way based on the database.

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,490
Speaker 1: So I'd have to make a database interface instead of the flat files, and it's complicated.

32
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:09,570
Speaker 1: Not that good of an idea especially for my implementation.

33
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,647
Speaker 1: So found this plug-in this thing that will synchronize two wikis, and it'll be offline online.

34
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:16,530
Speaker 1: It's like this beautiful thing.

35
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:17,349
Speaker 1: So I'm testing it.

36
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:30,700
Speaker 1: I set up my old test environment and I make a change on one Twiki and I hit replicate and the change is put in the other wiki and vice versa and it uses the actual wiki API's Instead of using some sort of file system level thing.

37
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:33,050
Speaker 1: so it reconciles changes properly.

38
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:36,190
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good deal, but the point is disaster recovery.

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,723
Speaker 1: So if one server is down right then if people are making changes to the other one.

40
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,927
Speaker 1: because if I use an r-sync all right Great.

41
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:51,070
Speaker 1: But if one server is down and people use the other server As soon as the first server comes back up it starts r-syncing those files right back in and it doesn't really I lose stuff.

42
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:57,550
Speaker 1: So uh I turn off one of the servers and I hit replicate and it's it sits there for a while.

43
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:03,329
Speaker 1: I think all right great, and then I go to uh use my wiki and Everything's gone.

44
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:07,770
Speaker 1: So I look through the log and it had basically connected to my down wiki.

45
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:11,421
Speaker 1: Saw it wasn't there and the logic wasn't so great on this thing.

46
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,253
Speaker 1: so it said well that page is gone from the main server So I'll delete it.

47
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:18,750
Speaker 1: well that page is gone, so I'll delete it and every page was gone.

48
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,034
Speaker 1: So it deleted my entire wiki.

49
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:20,736
Speaker 0: awesome.

50
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:21,458
Speaker 1: God damn it.

51
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,742
Speaker 1: so alright.

52
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:25,170
Speaker 1: I bring the other server back out like fuck.

53
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,770
Speaker 1: I'm gonna restore this thing I'm gonna start working again.

54
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,788
Speaker 1: So I hit synchronize on the main server again to sync it back up to do some more testing.

55
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:38,889
Speaker 1: see if I can Maybe have the script at least I don't know paying the other server first or see if the main wiki page is up or something before it synchronizes.

56
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:43,004
Speaker 1: and I had synchronized and then as soon as I had synchronized.

57
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:43,768
Speaker 1: I think wait a minute.

58
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:49,007
Speaker 1: So I start tailing the Twiggy log right and I see it going.

59
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,663
Speaker 1: hey I see that you deleted this page.

60
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:54,150
Speaker 1: Oh replication slave.

61
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,161
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna delete my copy.

62
00:03:56,362 --> 00:04:06,020
Speaker 1: Oh, I see you deleted that page So I'm gonna delete the I copy of that too and all the other Twickeys in this whole cluster Systematically deleted one another and themselves.

63
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:08,150
Speaker 0: Oh, that's some good programming.

64
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,481
Speaker 1: That was yeah, and at that point.

65
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:20,367
Speaker 1: I knew it was happening and instead of stopping it I just kind of let it go to see how long it would take A while and took about 30 seconds to wipe out the rest of the wiki's from that point.

66
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:23,470
Speaker 0: awesome Yeah.

67
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:25,588
Speaker 1: So that is my wiki story.

68
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:32,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know I was sitting around today, and I was thinking you know hey I haven't heard any news about that spectrum auction.

69
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:37,350
Speaker 0: there was news about it But then everyone shut up, and then just now that was what I thought earlier in the day.

70
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,861
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the last news I saw was no one bid enough money.

71
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:42,486
Speaker 0: Huh there was news after that.

72
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:45,479
Speaker 0: that I did see but Just that just today.

73
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,504
Speaker 0: I realized when I got home And I went to go look at my Google Reader to find a news.

74
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:55,036
Speaker 0: all right I stopped sort of reading Google Reader And there's a thousand tech news's.

75
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:57,185
Speaker 0: and oh look a bunch of them are at the spectrum auction.

76
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:58,049
Speaker 0: I just didn't read them.

77
00:04:59,152 --> 00:04:59,956
Speaker 0: There are plenty of them.

78
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:01,344
Speaker 1: so that gonna be your news?

79
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,450
Speaker 0: no not at all.

80
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:08,974
Speaker 0: I'm just pointing out that it took me a long time to find a news because there are a thousand tech news items I had to go through.

81
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:15,699
Speaker 1: well you see Scott lately has been doing something that I've done in my life before and it seems like Maybe this would be a PSA for all of you geeks out there.

82
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:28,669
Speaker 1: if you read the internet all the time if you stop Obsessively reading the internet for like a week and only read it when you need to look something up You might suddenly have a different outlook on life for a couple days.

83
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:35,037
Speaker 0: It's weird because every time I think I'm like you know you know or like Especially.

84
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:46,950
Speaker 0: it's not that I think I'm hooked on anything But like other people I can understand from their perspective that they would think I would be hooked on something You know like because I do certain things a lot, and I recognize I do them a lot.

85
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:55,548
Speaker 0: It'd be understandable if someone thought I was addicted to them in some way, but every time I say no I'm just gonna stop doing that I pretty much stopped doing it immediately and don't.

86
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:59,750
Speaker 0: What I've noticed is that I never have any withdrawal symptoms there.

87
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:07,402
Speaker 1: Well what I've noticed and I this happened to me a couple times in my life is if I stop reading the internet especially stop reading the internet for no point.

88
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:17,348
Speaker 1: if I stop the Just generic novelty seeking like let's go to FARC and see what the headlines are Let's go to FARC again, and see what the new headlines are I?

89
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:26,485
Speaker 1: Generally feel a lot more awake and happy and better after I stopped And it might have to do with elevated serotonin levels or whatever.

90
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:27,290
Speaker 1: not gonna get into that.

91
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,436
Speaker 0: I don't have any problem with that.

92
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:31,330
Speaker 0: I feel the same as I did before you say that, but I've noticed something.

93
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,385
Speaker 1: It's been a lot easier to do the show since you stopped reading internet.

94
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:35,330
Speaker 0: We haven't done the show.

95
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:37,417
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what.

96
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:40,370
Speaker 1: it's a lot easier to do right now whatever but not last week.

97
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,959
Speaker 1: You weren't reading the internet either so much.

98
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:44,010
Speaker 0: We didn't really do the show last week.

99
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,472
Speaker 0: We did.

100
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:50,214
Speaker 0: we only skipped one anyway, but uh you want me to do the news that I did find I don't know.

101
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:52,784
Speaker 1: I got another kind of life anecdote.

102
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:53,748
Speaker 1: this related to tech.

103
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:55,790
Speaker 1: all right I could tell this one because it's kind of important.

104
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,743
Speaker 1: We're going to a katsu khan next weekend this weekend actually.

105
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:04,669
Speaker 1: so if you live in the DC area And you want to meet us We're gonna be in DC.

106
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:11,346
Speaker 1: So if you don't want to pay to get into katsu khan because you're not an anime fan one You probably should anyway because katsu khan is not like most anime khan's.

107
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:12,210
Speaker 1: you probably have a good time.

108
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,446
Speaker 1: But that aside give us a line, and maybe we'll see you for lunch or something.

109
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:17,787
Speaker 1: I don't know.

110
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:18,710
Speaker 1: we'll sign an autograph.

111
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:19,814
Speaker 1: We'll be in DC.

112
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:21,319
Speaker 0: This is Chipotle right outside.

113
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,243
Speaker 0: We'll be eating there.

114
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:25,455
Speaker 0: We'll be there three times a day Not three times.

115
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:27,444
Speaker 1: God I almost ate at Chipotle today too.

116
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:28,930
Speaker 0: We'll probably eat lunch there every day though.

117
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:38,364
Speaker 1: I walked past two Chipotle's today, and I stopped if I thought about getting it But then I decided to eat the chicken drumsticks that were in the fridge I stopped in front of both of them and thought oh, man.

118
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:39,430
Speaker 1: I should eat some Chipotle.

119
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:45,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the reason I passed too is I was we need audio stuff because we you know we're going to this katsu khan.

120
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,373
Speaker 1: We went last year.

121
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:58,865
Speaker 1: We kind of run the audio for the game room and last year It was a sad sight with our little piss ant mixer and our like Crappy little compressor in the Mac and we didn't know much about what we were doing.

122
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:00,390
Speaker 1: so we had this gigantic mess of.

123
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,504
Speaker 1: If you see pictures of our setup at katsu khan, and you know anything about audio.

124
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,110
Speaker 1: You'll probably kill yourself.

125
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:07,342
Speaker 1: It was like the worst thing ever.

126
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:07,927
Speaker 0: it's pretty sad.

127
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,359
Speaker 1: So now we have real equipment.

128
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,484
Speaker 1: so to finish that off.

129
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:16,167
Speaker 1: I bought this big oh more real Yeah, but I bought this big case like we're done now.

130
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:17,272
Speaker 1: I got all the stuff I need.

131
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:20,583
Speaker 1: we can bring the whole geek nights rig anywhere trivially.

132
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:26,630
Speaker 1: It's ready to go and I Realized that I need right-angle cables as opposed to straight-in cables.

133
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,680
Speaker 1: There's not so much room in the back, so I thought all right.

134
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:33,799
Speaker 0: I could order these online But which you should have done like I told you to.

135
00:08:34,142 --> 00:08:35,970
Speaker 1: well the thing is even if I've ordered them online.

136
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:39,724
Speaker 1: There's a good chance They would not have come but you would order them when I told you to.

137
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:40,789
Speaker 0: it would have been just fine.

138
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:41,333
Speaker 1: What then?

139
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,429
Speaker 1: they would have shipped Monday evening?

140
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:48,046
Speaker 0: They might have showed up Wednesday evening if I every time they've ever shipped anything to us.

141
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:48,870
Speaker 0: They shut up the next day.

142
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:50,756
Speaker 1: Actually no, that's not true.

143
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:55,830
Speaker 1: that was only true the second time we ordered from them and that time I actually paid a lot for expedited shipping.

144
00:08:56,511 --> 00:09:03,106
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you don't pay for expedited shipping it comes in three to five days And it ships pretty much the evening of like at eleven fifty nine.

145
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:08,769
Speaker 1: They say well the shift Yeah, I'm not worried about it, but anyway, so I figure all right, New York City.

146
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:13,350
Speaker 1: There's a million audio like professional audio stores.

147
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:18,295
Speaker 1: I can just go to one and buy everything I need duh And there's.

148
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:26,652
Speaker 1: they're right by my work, so I walk over there You know to like 48th Street and 6th and 7th Avenue where there's a Sam Ash and Manny's music And there's.

149
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:31,046
Speaker 1: there's like five audio stores and like ones air one area and down the block.

150
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:31,729
Speaker 1: There's a couple more.

151
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:34,365
Speaker 1: So I go to Sam Ash like the big one.

152
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:35,130
Speaker 1: It's pretty well known.

153
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:37,510
Speaker 0: It's like a Sam Ash is mostly an instrument store.

154
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:43,250
Speaker 1: No, it's not Scott Sam Ash as like five different kinds of stores, and they have one of all of them over there.

155
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:52,502
Speaker 0: That's only over there around the country like Sam Ash is like a big chain and most of their stores Just like you know music It's sort of like a Guitar Center kind of kind of place.

156
00:09:52,803 --> 00:10:06,405
Speaker 1: so but they have a recording one like the professional recording equipment they have like thousands of different mixers and compressors and audio cables and microphones and DJ equipment and like everything you need for recording studio foam everything.

157
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:07,710
Speaker 1: so I go in I'm looking.

158
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,557
Speaker 1: I don't see what I need.

159
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:19,129
Speaker 1: so I go up to the Proprietor of the store like standing behind the counter, and I ask sir I need some right-angle quarter-inch insert cables, and he says oh, they're right over there.

160
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:24,909
Speaker 1: And he points at the area where they sell raw cable making equipment.

161
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:41,970
Speaker 1: So I walk over there, and I walk back and say ah no there's nothing like that over there I need an insert cable and already made insert cable, and he says oh I mean they're over there, so I look where he's pointing and he's pointing at the mono guitar cables.

162
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:52,467
Speaker 1: There is nothing but monster $40 like 30-foot mono guitar cables there all right, so I say could you show me where they are?

163
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:53,810
Speaker 1: and at this point?

164
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,349
Speaker 1: I'm suspecting perhaps this gentleman does not in fact know what an insert cable is.

165
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:05,694
Speaker 1: And I talked to him further, and I discovered that he doesn't know Anything About audio.

166
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:10,489
Speaker 1: he does not know I. he could not even tell me what the cables he pointed at do.

167
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:13,377
Speaker 1: So I asked him to see the manager.

168
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:13,939
Speaker 1: the manager comes.

169
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:25,215
Speaker 1: I said look I need some right-angle insert cables, and he says and he kind of looks at the other guy and the other guy gives him this look of us and After about 20 minutes.

170
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:26,981
Speaker 1: I explained what an insert cable was.

171
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,570
Speaker 1: he says oh, sorry sorry you were saying insert cable.

172
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,412
Speaker 1: I thought you meant something else.

173
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:42,038
Speaker 1: they're right over here, and he takes me to the not quarter inch, but eighth inch monster Y splitters Which are not what I want.

174
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:46,965
Speaker 1: so I explained to him what an insert cable does and he says oh We wouldn't carry anything weird like that.

175
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,426
Speaker 1: So I point behind him at the insert cables and say no they're exactly that.

176
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:53,490
Speaker 1: that is what I want.

177
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:57,470
Speaker 1: I just want that with that right angle connector on the instead of a straight in connector.

178
00:11:57,912 --> 00:11:58,153
Speaker 1: He's like.

179
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:00,041
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone makes anything like that, and I'm like.

180
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:02,270
Speaker 1: I just saw them online.

181
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:04,840
Speaker 1: I just wanted to buy them here instead of ordering them online.

182
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,282
Speaker 1: They exist.

183
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:12,304
Speaker 1: in fact the same company makes them And the guy was like uh and I was like god damn it never mind.

184
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:12,765
Speaker 1: I left.

185
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:18,303
Speaker 1: yep, so You know how geeks like we always complain about if you go to a computer store.

186
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:23,661
Speaker 1: none of the employees know anything about computers But they act like they know and they rip off people who don't know anything.

187
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:24,263
Speaker 1: Yep.

188
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:26,310
Speaker 1: I've learned something important.

189
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:35,670
Speaker 1: It's true for all stores period if you know anything about a product and you go to a store that sells that product You're going to learn that no one in that store knows jack for shit about that technology.

190
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:38,923
Speaker 0: Someone who actually knows something about something?

191
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:43,430
Speaker 0: unless they're a college student You know where they're not gonna be working retail.

192
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:47,265
Speaker 0: So if you actually know what the fuck you want you buy it online.

193
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:49,235
Speaker 0: if you don't know what the fuck you want you go To a store.

194
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:54,610
Speaker 0: and because you don't know what the fuck you want Someone else tells you to buy expensive monster cable, and that's how the world works.

195
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:55,733
Speaker 1: It was amazing.

196
00:12:55,773 --> 00:13:03,609
Speaker 0: the days of intelligent people in retail stores being able to help you out are over because as someone actually knows They can make more money somewhere else.

197
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,565
Speaker 0: They're not gonna work in a shit retail store, but every

198
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:14,097
Speaker 1: single store I went to it wasn't like like no one at any point said I don't know what an insert cable is or I'm sorry I'm not because

199
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:14,849
Speaker 0: they don't expect

200
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:15,652
Speaker 1: You

201
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:22,496
Speaker 0: to actually know what the hell you're that you want because anyone who comes in the store doesn't know because all the people do Buy it online like I told you to.

202
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:27,333
Speaker 1: so I. well we couldn't have gotten it in time unless I paid for like $20 Express shipping.

203
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,118
Speaker 0: now we would have gotten it now.

204
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:32,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, you realize that it wouldn't come in time would have been fine.

205
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,265
Speaker 0: Well, we're not having any time anyway, so what's the difference?

206
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:37,449
Speaker 1: cuz I didn't need it I have everything to do for the show.

207
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,681
Speaker 1: I just needed better cable, so I don't know I can leave the.

208
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:41,289
Speaker 1: I don't have to leave the back off of this thing.

209
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:52,625
Speaker 1: So what annoys me is that the people they pretty much every single person at every single audio store every single one on 48th Street in New York City or anywhere nearby there.

210
00:13:52,685 --> 00:14:02,503
Speaker 1: I stopped at several Lied and tried to tell me to buy a thing that had nothing to do with what I asked for But was $40 or so and had the word monster on it.

211
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:09,264
Speaker 0: Yep, so All right, why don't you try going to the the B&H over by the mad square garden?

212
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:13,410
Speaker 0: That's kind of out of my way I know, but it's a really fancy store.

213
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:19,752
Speaker 1: They um I went to five other news nice stores, and this isn't really a music store But it's a.

214
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,343
Speaker 0: it's like a photo store, but oh yeah, they're gonna have.

215
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:22,784
Speaker 0: they do.

216
00:14:22,824 --> 00:14:24,190
Speaker 0: they have crazy equipment there.

217
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:26,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what the same as you want to know.

218
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,630
Speaker 0: But this is the store where all they like the TV and radio people go to shop to get stuff for work.

219
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:37,273
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what people do that at these Sam ashes too because it's right next to like the the Fox News thing and Everything.

220
00:14:37,414 --> 00:14:37,776
Speaker 0: no.

221
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,044
Speaker 1: It's just they did.

222
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:40,050
Speaker 1: they had other equipment.

223
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,449
Speaker 1: They didn't have exactly what I wanted, and they didn't know what anything was.

224
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:46,162
Speaker 0: I think it's worth your shot to go to the B&H.

225
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:47,730
Speaker 1: I highly doubt it.

226
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:53,010
Speaker 1: I could not find a single audio store even around beacon that sells what I want nothing around beacon.

227
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,258
Speaker 0: I'm betting that store will have what you want.

228
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,403
Speaker 1: I'll bet you 50 bucks.

229
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:57,548
Speaker 0: They don't and I've been 50 bucks.

230
00:14:58,051 --> 00:14:59,907
Speaker 1: Uh-huh well you go check tomorrow.

231
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,370
Speaker 0: It's farther away from me than it is from you so you're suggesting that I go over there way out of my way.

232
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:08,049
Speaker 0: It's like a 10-minute walk.

233
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:09,699
Speaker 1: Actually, it's more than that.

234
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:10,728
Speaker 1: I don't have time for that.

235
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:17,537
Speaker 1: No, whatever it took me an hour to go up to the other music stores and argue with the people who own them until I Discovered that they're all incompetent.

236
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway.

237
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:21,710
Speaker 1: I just said all right well I got to get some printing done on foam boards.

238
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,082
Speaker 1: I didn't want to order that online just because I didn't really need it that badly.

239
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,874
Speaker 1: and I know it's super cheap to print stuff On foam board.

240
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:29,924
Speaker 1: so I go to the printer in my building like all right.

241
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:30,889
Speaker 1: I got a USB stick here.

242
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:36,150
Speaker 1: I Can I print some like two foot by three foot two foot by one foot foam boards black and white?

243
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:36,820
Speaker 1: He's like.

244
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:37,450
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's easy.

245
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,129
Speaker 1: I look for you tomorrow.

246
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:39,334
Speaker 1: So I give him the things.

247
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:44,250
Speaker 1: and the first sign of trouble was he looks in the directory, and he's like all right.

248
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:50,349
Speaker 1: So what's here, and I'm like There's only two image files there.

249
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,230
Speaker 1: I want both of them printed, and he's like how big you want.

250
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,551
Speaker 1: I'm like.

251
00:15:53,852 --> 00:16:00,298
Speaker 1: well their actual size in the image files their pings like oh, okay, and he starts he's getting And he figures it out.

252
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:01,384
Speaker 1: I show him how to do everything.

253
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:03,929
Speaker 1: He's like all right all right I'll print these on for you tomorrow.

254
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:05,696
Speaker 1: You want to put down a deposit.

255
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,020
Speaker 1: I'm thinking deposit.

256
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,669
Speaker 1: it cost like 20 bucks to print something on poster boards.

257
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:12,675
Speaker 1: I'm like How much is it gonna be for all this?

258
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:15,383
Speaker 1: and he says a hundred something bucks plus tax.

259
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:18,235
Speaker 1: yeah, and I'm like all right Never mind.

260
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:18,599
Speaker 1: He's like what.

261
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:19,063
Speaker 1: what do you mean?

262
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:19,770
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good deal.

263
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,111
Speaker 1: I'm like.

264
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:24,510
Speaker 1: I can get this for like 20 bucks online plus shipping and he didn't believe me.

265
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,116
Speaker 1: He honestly did not believe.

266
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:26,959

Speaker 1: That's not true.

271
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,981
Speaker 1: You're just trying to scam me.

272
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:31,770
Speaker 1: This is a pretty good deal.

273
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,839
Speaker 1: I'll print these things for you, but that's what it cost.

274
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:34,702
Speaker 1: I was like.

275
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:38,116
Speaker 1: I named like four places Mmm online.

277
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:47,557
Speaker 0: yeah, I would.

278
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:50,828
Speaker 0: I would actually gone to the websites on his computer and showed him

279
00:16:51,410 --> 00:17:02,744
Speaker 1: see He wouldn't let me behind his little counter And he was obviously getting very irate partly because I think there were other customers standing there And they were giving each other this look of whoa wait a minute I think this guy's been ripping us

280
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:03,188
Speaker 0: off.

281
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:14,050
Speaker 1: So uh I was starting to think all right I think I'm gonna swear off buying anything at a brick-and-mortar store ever again except groceries.

282
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,015
Speaker 0: Congratulations.

283
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,710
Speaker 0: Did you join the Scott Club, but then learn something?

284
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:28,319
Speaker 1: I learned many long ago, but I went to one other store, and I realized that now There is one thing that I'm probably better off buying it in person other than food And I went to a strong thing to try it on.

285
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,770
Speaker 1: actually no I ordered a bunch of clothes from Amazon.

286
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:40,448
Speaker 1: They should be here tomorrow all right, but I there's one thing that if you order from Amazon It's really not as good as getting it in person, and that is a haircut all right.

287
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:42,310

Speaker 0: It was.

296
00:17:54,741 --> 00:18:00,745
Speaker 0: the thing is I don't know if I'd pay 30 bucks again But it was not only a good haircut, but it was very convenient.

297
00:18:00,886 --> 00:18:01,930
Speaker 0: being right the fuck there.

298
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:05,015
Speaker 1: Well you see I paid the $60 But that's cuz.

299
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:09,279
Speaker 1: I got like the head massage and the wash And I just had my hair washed and then cut.

300
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:09,961
Speaker 0: I didn't like.

301
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:16,249
Speaker 1: I got the styling and the full deal and let me tell You that was like the best haircut of my life, man, and I don't think Amazon's gonna cut it.

302
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:18,480
Speaker 0: No, you sure I don't think so.

303
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:19,947
Speaker 0: actually I'm gonna check right now.

304
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:27,184
Speaker 1: God if I was Amazon I would sell haircut And if anyone ever bought it, I don't know what I do, but I'd sell it.

305
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,650
Speaker 0: hold on haircut.

306
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:30,358
Speaker 1: I don't think you're gonna find it.

307
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:33,714
Speaker 0: Oh, but you can get a hair clipper And you get.

308
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:36,589
Speaker 0: you can get hair cutting for dummies, so there you go.

309
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:38,175
Speaker 1: I know what that looks like.

310
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:42,350
Speaker 1: that looks like search for a home haircut on YouTube or Google video.

311
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:44,474
Speaker 1: Anyway, what do you got in the news?

312
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:53,835
Speaker 0: I got four cell phone news is I'm gonna combine and I'm maybe arrive at a point I haven't arrived at a point in my brain yet, but maybe by the time I'm done talking about these newses.

313
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,641
Speaker 0: I will figure something out to say this.

314
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,150
Speaker 0: insightful alright, so first news ready.

315
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,382
Speaker 0: These are all from Engadget by the way.

316
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:01,970
Speaker 0: What's an iPhone?

317
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,209
Speaker 0: 14.3 million Windows mobile phones were sold in the past six months alone.

318
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:13,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, not so not nearly that many iPhones are sold in it the iPhones entire life.

319
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:16,517
Speaker 1: It is a pretty new product.

320
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:19,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this is we're talking about the lady.

321
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:24,109
Speaker 0: in the last just the last six months 14.3 Windows mobile phone sold worldwide.

322
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,584
Speaker 1: well I think the reason is that the primary of 40 more three million not 14.3.

323
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,126
Speaker 0: That'd be yeah.

324
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:32,704
Speaker 0: I said yeah, I got the point three of a Windows mobile phone.

325
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:34,310
Speaker 0: the other point seven fell in the trash.

326
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:40,830
Speaker 1: But I think part of that is that the primary market for smartphones are businessmen.

327
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:42,116
Speaker 0: That's what I was gonna say.

328
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:49,210
Speaker 1: really this man like I have a blackberry for work And that's because all there's no business enterprise stuff for the iPhone.

329
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:51,462
Speaker 1: I can't use an iPhone at work for any of my stuff.

330
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:52,930
Speaker 1: I gotta use a blackberry or something.

331
00:19:53,111 --> 00:20:00,643
Speaker 0: I think what that shows us is that even though the iPhone is way cool You know relatively speaking I think is that the market for phones.

332
00:20:00,703 --> 00:20:02,790
Speaker 0: the vast majority of people still want a phone.

333
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,470
Speaker 0: They're just fucking at least in the u.s.

334
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,593
Speaker 1: I know what I think.

335
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:11,959
Speaker 1: I think it's really just that iPhone doesn't support the enterprise business II stuff that these people Yeah, so businessmen won't get it.

336
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,790
Speaker 0: and normal people don't want a smartphone.

337
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:18,677
Speaker 1: they want a regular phone, but I think Apple is still doing a smart thing with the iPhone because There is that.

338
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:28,818
Speaker 1: I think it's kind of like the blue ocean Strategy of there are people who they can sell an iPhone to who do not need the enterprise business phone But yet they would like to have something cool from Apple.

339
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:41,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think slowly but surely they're gonna have to just try to Get try to change people's minds because the a lot of people in the USA I just want to make calls and they don't really and even me who you know wants fancy features.

340
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:54,028
Speaker 0: I got a phone that's got a lot of fancy features, and I think I said this on the show before yeah But I'd soon as I got the phone I was like ooh And I started you know hacking it and unlocking it and using all the fancy features and stuff.

341
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:55,294
Speaker 1: right now You make holes.

342
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,062
Speaker 0: I'd like within a day.

343
00:20:57,183 --> 00:20:58,670
Speaker 0: I just stopped using all that shit.

344
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,655
Speaker 0: I just made calls.

345
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:02,810
Speaker 1: you know like people always say oh rim doesn't buy technology.

346
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,376
Speaker 1: That's just cuz.

347
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,850
Speaker 1: you know I'm cheap and I'm lazy.

348
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,550
Speaker 1: No, there's all sorts of reasons why I don't buy a lot of fancy technology.

349
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,017
Speaker 1: But I was given cuz.

350
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:10,644
Speaker 1: I always wanted a smartphone.

351
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:11,810
Speaker 1: I'd love to have something like that.

352
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:17,839
Speaker 1: I just wasn't willing to spend a bunch of money and my work gave me one and it's I Got it and for like two or three days right.

353
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:20,190
Speaker 1: I was like installing every freaking application.

354
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,294
Speaker 1: I got the opera browser.

355
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:36,589
Speaker 1: I set up all my RSS feeds got the Google Maps the GPS and now every now, and then I look at my work email, and then I work at my home look at my home email and Then I look and say oh wow there's nothing new cuz I just checked it on my computer an hour ago

356
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:37,192
Speaker 0: Yeah,

357
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:38,817
Speaker 1: and then I go oh Google Maps.

358
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:44,253
Speaker 1: That'd be great with the GPS if I still drove anywhere, but oh Google Reader.

359
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:48,849
Speaker 1: oh, I already read my Google Reader and edge is a lot slower than my computer at home.

360
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:50,713
Speaker 1: and Oh great.

361
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:55,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is why despite the fact that the iPhone is not unlocked and is sort of evil.

362
00:21:55,953 --> 00:22:07,980
Speaker 0: I might consider getting one next year when my Contract runs out because in all reality the only things I'll use are like the Google stuff And it'll replace my iPod and I carry one less device.

363
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,229
Speaker 0: if I didn't have I wouldn't actually use that other stuff that often.

364
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:11,289
Speaker 0: if

365
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:25,219
Speaker 1: I Didn't have a blackberry for work and need a blackberry for work I would probably also get an iPhone soon because you know what it replaces my iPod And I can see myself watching videos and stuff and all the stuff It does is the stuff that I do like.

366
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:27,990
Speaker 1: the thing I use my blackberry for the most is the Google Maps.

367
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,556
Speaker 1: Just cuz I could need to look for a business.

368
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:32,969
Speaker 1: You know what that works really really well on the iPhone works, okay?

369
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:34,954
Speaker 0: Speaking of the iPhone.

370
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:39,067
Speaker 0: There's a new 16 gig iPhone and the iPod touch is now 32 gigs.

371
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:45,989
Speaker 1: My nano is two gigs mines for I don't know why you got the two Because it was a lot cheaper.

372
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,458
Speaker 1: You know what it's never filled up.

373
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,101
Speaker 0: No.

374
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:51,069
Speaker 0: I filled up my I've gone over to before.

375
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:58,084
Speaker 1: well You know what it's gonna go over to now because I haven't listened to podcasts and months And I'm gonna sync up before we go to katsu khan so great.

376
00:22:58,165 --> 00:23:03,300
Speaker 0: Okay, it's also You know the Nokia n95 which is pretty much the phone that does everything right?

377
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:11,913
Speaker 0: Nokia n96 we're talking like $800 here, but this is one ludicrous motherfucking phone.

378
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:18,112
Speaker 0: Let me tell you it's got like a TV tuner and that is what I need.

379
00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:24,130
Speaker 0: it's got an engage action in there, and oh Wi-Fi GPS, that's cool.

380
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:26,540
Speaker 0: It's guy pretty much anything you could imagine.

381
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,230
Speaker 0: This is the kitchen sink of phones.

382
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:32,912
Speaker 0: if I was stupidly rich I would get it, but really I wouldn't use 90% of that stuff.

383
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:34,559
Speaker 0: so maybe even that I wouldn't got.

384
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,360
Speaker 1: you know It's it's a pipe dream, and it's not even a pipe dream.

385
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:46,640
Speaker 1: This is like fantasy talk, but what I really want like like the perfect phone for me Is something the size of this blackberry like the size and shape of this blackberry?

386
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:59,023
Speaker 1: No, no I got a scratch that the perfect phone just connects to my brain and I can just talk and do whatever my brain so never Mind yeah, and the one last bit of phone news here the Android.

387
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:00,389
Speaker 0: you know the Google Android thing.

388
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:08,492
Speaker 0: they put out the SDK a while back And they had a little contest that was like hey whoever makes the best stuff you'll get ten million dollars And you know whatever.

389
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,660
Speaker 0: right well You know the SDK they put out had some problems.

390
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:18,580
Speaker 0: I tried to use it and it did have some problems like you couldn't do certain things and you couldn't test certain features properly.

391
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:27,889
Speaker 0: So now they've said all right all right We're gonna update the SDK in a few weeks, and we're gonna delay the contest until April, and I'm like oh Uh-huh.

392
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:31,269
Speaker 0: so it seems I don't know how much confidence I have in this Android.

393
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:36,400
Speaker 0: now there seems to be some slip-ups going on with it and such you Know even though it has some promise.

394
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:42,580
Speaker 0: But luckily all this will be sorted out by January oh nine when my phone contract runs out, and I'll be okay.

395
00:24:43,463 --> 00:24:52,156
Speaker 1: So uh I actually got some news too despite all my anecdotal Talking about walking around in New York City and failing at buying consumer services.

396
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:57,923
Speaker 1: right now There's a lot of talk in our forums and the rest of the internet about Anonymous.

397
00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:01,013
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get into all that but theoretically.

398
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:13,893
Speaker 1: I'm sure you all know you're all internet people that Anonymous had planned and that's interesting to say because anonymous is not a person or a group supposedly But some sort of second-order simulacra, but I'll get to that now.

399
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:18,231
Speaker 0: well you're getting to a lot of things here But not really saying much I'm getting.

400
00:25:18,271 --> 00:25:19,080
Speaker 1: I'm getting to that.

401
00:25:19,948 --> 00:25:23,668
Speaker 1: So they'd planned this Protest of Scientology, and there was.

402
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,895
Speaker 1: there's a lot of talk on the internet about.

403
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:26,838
Speaker 1: this is the like.

404
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,159
Speaker 1: This is it.

405
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,160
Speaker 1: This is the emergence of behavior on the internet.

406
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:41,615
Speaker 1: This is anonymity and there's this cult of anonymity speaking out And we'd seen glimmers of this in a as yet unaired documentary that our friends Pete and James filmed at Otacon that they're still working on.

407
00:25:41,676 --> 00:25:45,728
Speaker 0: but oh Wait a way to call someone a shit talker.

408
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:49,120
Speaker 1: no the thing is we knew they need more footage name in more time.

409
00:25:49,200 --> 00:26:16,716
Speaker 1: I don't I don't call him anything because I didn't do anything much beyond geek nights lately, but They this happened on Sunday You know people were saying oh there's gonna be these thousands of it's gonna be this crazy protest and worried about the police and all That and I'm not gonna talk about the whole thing but it looks like maybe 200 people showed up to the New York City protest of Scientology and If this had been more successful now these people say oh, it was a great success.

410
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:17,760
Speaker 1: look at all the people we got.

411
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:28,120
Speaker 1: we got like 200 people in New York City and like 500 people in London and like One person in Tokyo and like 40 people here and 50 people here and all over the world all these Scientology in Tokyo.

412
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,127
Speaker 1: Well, they only had one guy protesting it.

413
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,213
Speaker 1: so maybe there's only one Scientologist.

414
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:33,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, I walked up.

415
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:34,197
Speaker 1: He's like.

416
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:51,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're dumb I was like hey whatever but All right This is this is like the emergence of the internet like Future the zeitgeist of the internet that at power of anonymity to rise up, and we're among you were everywhere blah blah blah.

417
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:55,372
Speaker 1: They only got 200 people despite all this talk.

418
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:57,440
Speaker 1: in the New York City metropolitan area.

419
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:04,723
Speaker 1: now That's 200 out of to estimate conservatively 17 million people Mm-hmm.

420
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:15,274
Speaker 1: so out of 17 million people in a generally representative of Geekery, and you know the kind of affluent technorati of America.

421
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:16,458
Speaker 1: You've got 200 people.

422
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,787
Speaker 1: There are 200 people in your little organization.

423
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:20,714
Speaker 0: I've seen flash mobs with more people than that.

424
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:27,394
Speaker 1: I don't want to call anonymous shit talkers, but If this has been more successful, I would have.

425
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:29,888
Speaker 1: I have this whole thing I want to talk about about someday.

426
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,200
Speaker 1: We're gonna have second-order simulacra.

427
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,960
Speaker 1: We're gonna have like these entities on the internet.

428
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,788
Speaker 1: But I'm not gonna talk about that because that didn't happen.

429
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:41,960
Speaker 1: the anonymous uprising was not this great event.

430
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:52,740
Speaker 1: It was basically just nothing more than what could have been done with BBS is ten years ago And it was just 4chan people and it wasn't anything special, and I I almost feel bad about that.

431
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,290
Speaker 0: You know I think this proves the what I what I we think.

432
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:59,540
Speaker 0: what does it prove that a lot of those people are?

433
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:15,880
Speaker 0: Miners who aren't just allowed to go to a protest they're probably in school and such and Those are probably shows you what a small percentage of the people are actually Independent free adult individuals who can get up and go somewhere when they want to without mommy.

434
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,231
Speaker 0: Can I go protest a Scientologist keep driving, New York City?

435
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,897
Speaker 0: I need some money for a train ticket.

436
00:28:20,937 --> 00:28:23,166
Speaker 0: I have a job I'm in high school.

437
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:29,658
Speaker 1: I mean I think when I go on 4chan look at hentai's I think what it comes down to ever seen a real boob.

438
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:31,826
Speaker 1: Wow, that was harsh.

439
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:32,771
Speaker 1: Yeah, see.

440
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:35,021
Speaker 1: I think what it really gives you real boobs They do.

441
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,008
Speaker 1: how many boobs that are in 4chan?

442
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:40,700
Speaker 0: not live in person, but I'm not since their mama had him.

443
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,525
Speaker 1: That's that's pretty harsh.

444
00:28:42,565 --> 00:28:43,990
Speaker 1: I wasn't gonna go that low, but

445
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:44,933
Speaker 0: what I want to go

446
00:28:44,954 --> 00:29:00,475
Speaker 1: is that someday we're going to see the emergent behavior of the internet and if like 10,000 people had just showed up in vmasks outside and walked by Scientology I would have talked about the revolution of the internet now.

447
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:03,487
Speaker 1: This is the future but Maybe in ten years.

448
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:04,612
Speaker 1: We're not at that point yet.

449
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:05,959
Speaker 1: 4chan is not the future.

450
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:09,712
Speaker 1: Anonymous is not a second-order simulacra.

451
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:14,551
Speaker 1: It is not the emergence of the stuff Undirected intelligent behavior on the internet.

452
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:16,500
Speaker 1: It's just one website.

453
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:17,929
Speaker 1: I mean something awful.

454
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,820
Speaker 0: problems is kind of a lame flash from a hub.

455
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,336
Speaker 1: But not even a flash from something awful could have probably pulled off something better than what you guys pulled off.

456
00:29:24,858 --> 00:29:25,400
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

457
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:28,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, it didn't impress me as much as I hate Scientology.

458
00:29:28,693 --> 00:29:30,220
Speaker 1: 200 people is all you can get.

459
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:35,967
Speaker 1: I think I had more of an impact on Scientology when I argued with one of them for like 10 minutes in Grand Central one day.

460
00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:37,790
Speaker 1: yeah all right.

461
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,696
Speaker 1: Anyway things of the day now.

462
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,630
Speaker 1: This is a much more impressive flash mob than what Scientology put off.

463
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,070
Speaker 1: I'm sure you're all familiar with improv everywhere.

464
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:58,014
Speaker 1: These people get a lot of respect for me because nothing in the best one They did is the.

465
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:01,130
Speaker 0: I think it was like meet an actual black man or something.

466
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:10,401
Speaker 0: I had this black guy and was that like Must've been like a ski resort or something like that and you just had a sign like, you know Like meet a black person and all these people came up.

467
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:12,570
Speaker 1: We're like, hey, I like the one in Union Square.

468
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,250
Speaker 1: We did all the dancing but Talk about a real flash mob.

469
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:23,742
Speaker 1: I have so much respect for these people because nothing in the world is greater to me Than people who go out with one thing in mind.

470
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:25,910
Speaker 1: that thing in mind is freakin squares.

471
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:32,230
Speaker 0: Freakin squares the the oldest form of entertainment known to geek and so this video.

472
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:35,706
Speaker 1: I mean the hippies were almost like proto geeks in terms of freakin squares.

473
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:36,390
Speaker 1: That's what they did.

474
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:45,469
Speaker 1: I learned that from The Simpsons and my mom who was a hippie for a number of years But ever bored just try to freak the squares freakin squares.

475
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,570
Speaker 1: But basically all these people gathered in Grand Central.

476
00:30:49,610 --> 00:31:00,058
Speaker 1: They're walking about doing their business and then suddenly for five minutes they all froze like in a sci-fi movie where time stops for some people but not other people and One.

477
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:05,070
Speaker 1: this was executed Masterfully, like this is so well done.

478
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:09,788
Speaker 1: Yeah The people tried real hard and the best part is apparently the cameraman who were filming it.

479
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:13,625
Speaker 1: We're acting as though they were just walking around and they're like Jesus.

480
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:14,689
Speaker 1: check this out, dude.

481
00:31:15,393 --> 00:31:20,313
Speaker 1: so they were acting like they were part of the crowd even though they're actually part of the flash mob, but There's one.

482
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:24,792
Speaker 1: there's a couple of people whose reaction borders on the This.

483
00:31:24,872 --> 00:31:26,458
Speaker 1: is it sci-fi something like?

484
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:28,265
Speaker 1: they're kind of freaking out like they're not.

485
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:29,530
Speaker 1: they don't get that.

486
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,276
Speaker 1: It's just that you can tell that they're.

487
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:33,323
Speaker 1: they're not quite a hundred percent.

488
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:35,110
Speaker 0: mean you mean they're squares.

489
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,809
Speaker 0: Possibly possibly they might be squares.

490
00:31:38,191 --> 00:31:43,210
Speaker 1: I think the best part though is the guy driving that garbage truck who's like he's on this radio is like man.

491
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:43,592
Speaker 1: I don't know.

492
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:45,020
Speaker 1: All these people are just frozen everywhere.

493
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,885
Speaker 1: I can't move my truck.

494
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:46,609
Speaker 1: I don't know what to do.

495
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,159
Speaker 0: Obviously, they're not hip and nobody.

496
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:50,002
Speaker 1: the guy's taking the strike.

497
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:51,308
Speaker 1: He's like, he just calls his boss.

498
00:31:51,348 --> 00:31:51,690
Speaker 1: He's like man.

499
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,493
Speaker 1: I'm stuck here all these.

500
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:54,180
Speaker 1: there's like hundreds of people frozen everywhere.

501
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:54,722
Speaker 1: I don't know.

502
00:31:55,526 --> 00:31:56,570
Speaker 1: and they all start moving again.

503
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,818
Speaker 1: He's like never mind.

504
00:31:57,858 --> 00:31:58,502
Speaker 1: They're all moving.

505
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,649
Speaker 1: I don't know what just happened.

506
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:04,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the fact that everyone applauds at the end really that was cool.

507
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:09,703
Speaker 1: man, check this video out and Anonymous you could learn something.

508
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:16,373
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, so I since I haven't been looking like Google Reader I had too many things of the day going on But rim found one.

509
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:18,499
Speaker 0: It's a pretty okay site here.

510
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:31,610
Speaker 0: He got it shows you a bunch of companies that you might know like Apple Canon, which I apparently was originally named a quenin or qua non Ibom one of my favorites Ibom googly, right?

511
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:43,217
Speaker 0: LG which is originally apparently lucky chemical and then was gold star and then was LG and It shows you their company logos and how they change over time.

512
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:44,342
Speaker 0: and well I got.

513
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:50,970
Speaker 0: the things I had to say about this is first of all They don't go all the way back with the Firefox logos.

514
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,480
Speaker 0: I used Firefox when it was called Phoenix, right?

515
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,457
Speaker 1: They have ibm's logo from 1888 and they don't have the first Firefox low.

516
00:32:59,517 --> 00:33:01,464
Speaker 0: I used Phoenix 0.5.

517
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:06,680
Speaker 1: that was back when I said that browser crashes all that Phoenix Firebird logo.

518
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,305
Speaker 0: They have theirs from like 0.8.

519
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:09,851
Speaker 0: All right, so they don't.

520
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:12,460
Speaker 0: they didn't go all the way back in time with the logos there.

521
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,799
Speaker 0: All right, which they should have.

522
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:17,007
Speaker 0: but Yeah, this is pretty cool.

523
00:33:17,469 --> 00:33:23,671
Speaker 0: And the other thing I learned from this right is All these companies big companies right with big trademarks.

524
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:28,426
Speaker 0: They changed their logos over time pretty significantly Except Google.

525
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:31,140
Speaker 0: So Google still changes just not so significantly.

526
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,392
Speaker 1: They changed the color of like one letter.

527
00:33:34,453 --> 00:33:38,147
Speaker 0: they change the colors around and they also There's an exclamation point.

528
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,913
Speaker 0: They got rid of and yeah, cuz it didn't look so.

529
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:44,734
Speaker 1: and they on JPEG a fight it Yeah, but anyway the head of that drop shadow.

530
00:33:44,995 --> 00:33:48,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, but change the font Not that much.

531
00:33:49,132 --> 00:33:51,785
Speaker 0: No, they It's okay.

532
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:56,065
Speaker 0: These companies change their logos and it worked out Like I've always been kind of worried.

533
00:33:56,085 --> 00:34:00,040
Speaker 0: that like, you know, we're gonna we're gonna change our look.

534
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:02,814
Speaker 0: If we pick a logo we had to stick with it forever.

535
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:03,960
Speaker 0: if we ever change it, we're fucked.

536
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,459
Speaker 0: I'm like no, you know what, you know, we got this logo.

537
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:09,536
Speaker 0: now We'll use it and then if we change it we can do that.

538
00:34:09,636 --> 00:34:10,340
Speaker 0: It's it's okay.

539
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:12,540
Speaker 1: The cool thing is I just feel bad.

540
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:14,820
Speaker 0: you know for whoever made it cuz it's like.

541
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:21,460
Speaker 0: You know when it's like you had someone design a logo for you use it and then when you stop using it It's like no not disrespecting you.

542
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:27,223
Speaker 1: Well, at least IBM got away with that because I'm pretty sure when they change the logos people who had made previous logos weren't alive Anymore.

543
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:33,775
Speaker 0: yeah, but I don't think we'll change ours soon But one day when you know a few years down the road if we ever have to.

544
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:34,820
Speaker 0: I won't feel too bad now.

545
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,344
Speaker 1: But the 1924 IBM logo.

546
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:42,208
Speaker 1: there's actually a really really big like poster thing of that at IBM.

547
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:45,900
Speaker 1: when I worked there and I so I was familiar with that logo and I always that was cool thing.

548
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:52,295
Speaker 1: But the ones before that before the merger I might have seen him before but I can't recall those.

549
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:54,022
Speaker 1: and I actually really like the first One.

550
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:58,225
Speaker 1: it's really got this kind of old School coolness to it.

551
00:34:58,707 --> 00:34:59,089
Speaker 1: I don't know.

552
00:34:59,109 --> 00:34:59,913
Speaker 1: I just really like that.

553
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:02,002
Speaker 0: I like that third one from 1911.

554
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:02,804
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that one though.

555
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:06,498
Speaker 1: I like the dot and like the O inside that C or whatever it is.

556
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:09,387
Speaker 1: Yeah Computer tabulating recording company.

557
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:09,848
Speaker 1: Yeah.

558
00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:10,390
Speaker 0: Okay.

00:35:11,995 --> 00:35:13,380
Speaker 1: wiki wiki wiki wiki.

561
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had my Twiki story.

562
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:20,060
Speaker 0: It was kind of relevant shall we say maybe all right, so say we talk about some wikis, right?

563
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure everyone here knows about the Wikipedia.

564
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,123
Speaker 1: Wikipedia.

565
00:35:24,203 --> 00:35:30,535
Speaker 1: we don't don't let Scott fool you with his mispronouncing ways Intentionally mispronouncing ways intentionally as it is.

566
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:31,240
Speaker 1: I don't know.

567
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,989
Speaker 1: I don't think Wikipedia is gonna catch on as some sort of internet meme.

568
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,614
Speaker 1: No, it's no pockner.

569
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:36,859
Speaker 0: It's caught on in my office.

570
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:39,604
Speaker 0: It's an office joke.

571
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:43,038
Speaker 1: have you ever seen the office because it's kind of along those lines.

572
00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:45,829
Speaker 0: I think No, not quite but it's worth seeing.

573
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:49,605
Speaker 0: actually I seen it but I'm saying not quite as in that along those lines I don't know.

574
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,820
Speaker 1: I don't think it's got the staying power anyway.

575
00:35:53,304 --> 00:35:54,687
Speaker 0: Okay, what is a wiki?

576
00:35:54,707 --> 00:35:59,860
Speaker 1: a wiki is is a fast thing because in the in the Hawaiian language the word wiki means fast.

577
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:12,414
Speaker 1: Yeah There was the see actually was funny because I remember there was a point a while ago when I think Emily said that yeah Wiki was named after this Hawaiian words like wiki wiki the wiki wiki bus And I think Scott was the one who baulked and said that can't be true.

578
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:13,117
Speaker 0: I didn't say that.

579
00:36:13,177 --> 00:36:17,994
Speaker 0: I said, I don't know Cuz I thought I heard something else, but I don't remember what I heard.

580
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:24,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, you usually do that Someone says something you go And then we look it up and oh, yeah, it was yeah and it was the wiki.

581
00:36:24,894 --> 00:36:30,274
Speaker 1: wiki bus is the original Inspiration for the wiki wiki web which became wikis.

582
00:36:31,743 --> 00:36:34,964
Speaker 1: Yes, so, uh, you're all familiar with Wikipedia But what act like?

583
00:36:35,346 --> 00:36:38,280
Speaker 1: you hear the word wiki and most people think Wikipedia.

584
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:48,020
Speaker 1: But I mean wiki actually means something broader than Wikipedia is a wiki just as hypertext Markup language is a standard general markup language.

585
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:53,927
Speaker 1: God anyway, so what Scott is a wiki?

586
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:55,752
Speaker 0: Well, it's.

587
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:59,746
Speaker 0: I don't know if I haven't looked up an actual Perfect definition of it.

588
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:00,350
Speaker 0: Basically.

589
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:15,377
Speaker 0: It's it's a web application typically a web application, you know and you have these pages and every page has a title and You each page within the page has these as these sort of wiki links that go to the other pages.

590
00:37:15,457 --> 00:37:19,006
Speaker 0: so it's this big Interlinked thing with all these different.

591
00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:19,909
Speaker 1: so the internet.

592
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:32,993
Speaker 0: I can just link to things right right because the difference is that Unlike, you know each page is just a web page, but unlike regular web pages Anyone who visits the web page you can just edit it all they want.

593
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:37,480
Speaker 0: Oh See originally, that's what the web was supposed to be.

594
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:44,380
Speaker 0: The whole web was supposed to be like that, but it was not really the kind of not really sorta not at all.

595
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you look at the original HTTP there were.

596
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,084
Speaker 0: there were verbs to do those sorts of things But now no one uses them.

597
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:51,831
Speaker 1: people didn't even use them back then.

598
00:37:51,872 --> 00:37:52,494
Speaker 1: so much.

599
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:53,619
Speaker 0: I know but they were there.

600
00:37:54,562 --> 00:37:56,469
Speaker 0: They sort ever gonna do it and then they didn't.

601
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,853
Speaker 1: the key to a wiki.

602
00:37:57,893 --> 00:38:07,122
Speaker 1: What a wiki really is is it's a collaborative platform of content publication and basically the idea here is that wikis.

603
00:38:07,303 --> 00:38:17,815
Speaker 1: what I want to get across to all of you because I don't want to go into like the history of Well a wiki was come up with by this guy in like 1995 and then in 1994 was like the seed of the idea.

604
00:38:17,835 --> 00:38:20,839
Speaker 1: and then in this year in this year They cuz no one cares about that.

605
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:21,884
Speaker 1: Most people don't know who.

606
00:38:21,944 --> 00:38:23,871
Speaker 1: any of those people who came up with the internet were like.

607
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:25,939
Speaker 1: how many you even know who Tim Berners-Lee is?

608
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:28,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many of you out there?

609
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:29,272
Speaker 1: You should.

610
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,079
Speaker 1: I did take classes on that at RIT.

611
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:48,840
Speaker 1: Anyway what a wiki is and what makes Wikipedia so great like Scott said is that Anyone and now anyone is has an asterisk after it But anyone can edit it and the power of that is like look at a company a corporation, right?

612
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,012
Speaker 1: You got a small company and you have documents, you know, you you you share emails you.

613
00:38:54,353 --> 00:39:12,492
Speaker 1: maybe there's the procedure for filling out a TPS Report or the procedure for invoking weeaboo, but whatever you're doing Either you have solved like a department that manages your documentation or like Bob from finances all the finance documentation and anytime you need to do something with finance.

614
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:23,213
Speaker 1: gotta call Bob or you got to go to like Bob's desk and root through his crap and find the piece of paper that he wrote it on five years ago or Joey Jojo dies and no one knows how to do his job anymore.

615
00:39:23,233 --> 00:39:29,480
Speaker 1: There's no documentation for it or The finance department has all their documentation, but it's on their own little web server.

616
00:39:29,922 --> 00:39:38,793
Speaker 1: That's running like some proprietary thing and no one else has access to it or someone else finds a problem And they ask Joe from finance to change it, but Joan from finance doesn't care.

617
00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:39,957
Speaker 1: He's dead or something.

618
00:39:39,997 --> 00:39:40,880
Speaker 1: It never gets updated.

619
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:42,145
Speaker 1: So a wiki.

620
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:54,567
Speaker 1: I'm Sam looking through the documentation for I don't know Joey Jojo's weeaboo procedure and I see that he spelled a couple words wrong and he left out the last important step Actually performing the weeaboo.

621
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,660
Speaker 1: So I just log in and I edit his page.

622
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:03,220
Speaker 1: So now everything's correct and I edited it and it has a record that oh, I'll rim edited it.

623
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:10,688
Speaker 1: So if I added penis penis penis way Howard Stern Howard Stern baba bowie The CEO can say I'll rim.

624
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:13,320
Speaker 1: Why did you deface my documentation?

625
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:20,692
Speaker 0: See there are other ways to accomplish the same task Like you could have a bunch of Word documents that everyone shares.

626
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,980
Speaker 0: or you know, you could do all sorts of collaborative.

627
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:28,493
Speaker 0: You know document editing sorts of things, you know It's not just for company documentation.

628
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:29,860
Speaker 0: You can use this for a lot of things.

629
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,766
Speaker 0: I mean look at dwarf fortress with their wiki.

630
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:35,436
Speaker 0: that's basically, you know has all the instructions on how to play the game.

631
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:42,876
Speaker 0: and look at Some other wiki's that like, you know have all the information about all the memes on 4chan and stuff like that.

632
00:40:42,896 --> 00:40:48,520
Speaker 0: Yep, you know, but Got nothing now my brain.

633
00:40:49,742 --> 00:40:53,039
Speaker 0: if I got my brain stored in a wiki, so it's hard for me to.

634
00:40:54,100 --> 00:41:04,624
Speaker 1: But the idea here the philosophy of wiki's because I mean there are a lot of ways you can You can restrict wiki's in different ways and you can make them to the point that they're barely even a wiki anymore and they just you.

635
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:05,568
Speaker 1: it's kind of like how you might.

636
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:14,560
Speaker 1: someone might use a WordPress to accomplish something very specific and You're not blogging but you're using blogging software to kind of do something else and you can do that with a wiki.

637
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:22,260
Speaker 1: but the sort of wiki philosophy is to tap the Collective knowledge of a body of people like at a company.

638
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:25,991
Speaker 1: everyone in your company knows a little bit of information or on the internet.

639
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:31,990
Speaker 1: people know stuff like I know stuff about audio and Someone else knows stuff about video and someone else knows stuff about weeaboo.

640
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,019
Speaker 1: So say I want to learn about weeaboo.

641
00:41:35,381 --> 00:41:39,796
Speaker 1: Well, someone else can write an article about it on the wiki or I need someone.

642
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:40,780
Speaker 1: just thinks one day.

643
00:41:41,203 --> 00:41:42,900
Speaker 1: Hey, I know a lot about TPS reports.

644
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:54,080
Speaker 1: I'm gonna write a procedure how to deal with the TPS report instead of having to find a web server in the company and and Get someone to host it and learn HTML and build this thing and get other people to go to it.

645
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:03,800
Speaker 1: And now that person's got to maintain it you can you can kind of Get the information of the collective body of everyone in your company with the philosophy that everyone has something to contribute.

646
00:42:04,243 --> 00:42:05,371
Speaker 1: Or else why are they working there?

647
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:06,680
Speaker 1: Why are they part of your community?

648
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:11,035
Speaker 1: And then you can tap all of that kind of unobtrusively.

649
00:42:11,115 --> 00:42:18,141
Speaker 1: once everyone knows how to deal with the wiki You have to train them in wiki and that's it because then everyone can contribute everything they know.

650
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:28,465
Speaker 1: you have this knowledge base and if put out correctly having a documentation and procedural wiki is like the best thing a Corporation can do is then

651
00:42:28,485 --> 00:42:33,288
Speaker 0: you can inspire everyone and hire people who can work for cheap and if they don't know something they look It up in the wiki.

652
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:36,330
Speaker 1: Yeah That is that is one philosophy.

653
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:42,071
Speaker 1: I think that's why I received a lot of resistance to Documentation and wikis and some other jobs.

654
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:42,916
Speaker 1: I've had before yeah

655
00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:57,341
Speaker 0: The group I think the only other thing for wiki is you know is of course the collaborative and the editing and whatnot and the You know harvesting the knowledge the little bit of knowledge for many people's to create a large body of knowledge in the in the database Or whatever.

656
00:42:58,084 --> 00:43:03,680
Speaker 0: is the the hyper text ness of it all where you're reading a page in saying encyclopedia, right?

657
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,559
Speaker 0: Then you're learning about something and it says oh, yeah, there's a fancy word that you don't know.

658
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,980
Speaker 0: Well, you know you look at that fancy word.

659
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:21,897
Speaker 0: you got to go get a dictionary or something and even then that might not help you and you got to do a google search in a wiki if There's a fancy word there odds are there might be an entire page about that fancy word.

660
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:27,840
Speaker 0: like for example At my company if I'm writing some documentation about this one web application, right?

661
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,428
Speaker 0: And that web application uses a library.

662
00:43:30,468 --> 00:43:38,660
Speaker 0: we made well when I mentioned the name of the library That will be a link to the page that talks about the library and this I think really helped.

663
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:57,660
Speaker 0: when you're trying to learn from a wiki and that You don't end up getting partial knowledge and having to infer figure things out You can actually if you spend the time to open up all the links and go deep down and and you know follow through on Everything you don't know you can learn in the fullness everything that there is to to be known.

664
00:43:57,941 --> 00:43:59,868
Speaker 1: Yep, and that very much ease.

665
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:16,817
Speaker 1: and in that regard Scott was right about how wikis if If they follow the wiki philosophy are a lot like the early web not so much in the collaborativeness but in the sense that there's a it's just a Page of information and there are links to other information from that information.

666
00:44:16,837 --> 00:44:22,996
Speaker 1: because remember the original Worldwide web was a bunch of pages with links to other pages and people used to follow those links.

667
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:26,480
Speaker 1: that that's almost a dying Phenomenon now except on Wikipedia.

668
00:44:26,922 --> 00:44:33,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, but the actually what I was trying to get at before was nowadays and you browse the web You're mostly doing get and post.

669
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:34,120
Speaker 0: that's pretty much it.

670
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,300
Speaker 0: But originally there in fact many, you know, if you set your web server up, right?

671
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,046
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of other things you can do.

672
00:44:40,086 --> 00:44:44,246
Speaker 0: you can put you can delete you can trace you can connect you can options You can.

673
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:46,131
Speaker 1: so little of that is used at all I know.

674
00:44:46,152 --> 00:44:52,200
Speaker 0: but Originally, the reason that those things are in there was they had the idea that people would put and delete you would upload.

675
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,171
Speaker 0: You know new things on top of the thing you were looking at, you know It would be.

676
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:00,697
Speaker 0: you know The original idea for the web was they would be more like what a wiki is now.

677
00:45:00,737 --> 00:45:04,858
Speaker 0: the whole web Didn't turn out to be it's but we have wiki now, so it's okay.

678
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:08,360
Speaker 0: Yep I think it's better this way to the whole web was a big wiki would be in trouble.

679
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:21,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I mean from technological standpoint and I said this a little bit before but learning how to deal with a wiki is a lot easier for a lot of people than learning how to deal with HTML and webpages and maintaining them.

680
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:38,319
Speaker 1: and and we could talk about I mean we should probably do a show someday on like the hot it like the best practice of how to actually use a wiki because I While I said, yeah, this is the best thing a company can do is to have a wiki at the same time and Improperly set up wiki or a wiki that is set up.

681
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:44,284
Speaker 1: It's just not in a way that is good or that is set up poorly or that is used by people who don't really understand What's going on?

682
00:45:44,888 --> 00:45:52,060
Speaker 1: We'll probably do a lot more harm than good And I could talk for hours because I'm actually doing that in my company right now.

683
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:57,332
Speaker 1: but in terms of how to set up a wiki or what's good or bad about wiki is not a set of workflows and all that stuff.

684
00:45:57,373 --> 00:46:00,560
Speaker 1: but The moral is geek nights episode.

685
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,218
Speaker 1: It's just a little.

686
00:46:01,782 --> 00:46:10,875
Speaker 1: we went along in the front partly because I'd have a lot to say without going into technical detail about wiki's is simply that Anytime you have to collaborate with more than a few people about something.

687
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:17,360
Speaker 1: I Believe that a wiki is probably even a temporary wiki is one of the best ways to do that.

688
00:46:18,321 --> 00:46:34,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you think about all the possibilities say you play D&D with all your friends Have the DM or someone run a wiki and you all just update your character information in there and you know say the DM posts a summary of the most recent session and then you go in and you you Remember one thing in more detail than he did.

689
00:46:34,689 --> 00:46:44,227
Speaker 1: so you add to it and then someone else says oh Well, I remember and they add to that and then oh, I'm gonna write a backstory and they add like this whole bit Anything you do you with other people.

690
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:50,828
Speaker 1: you can use a wiki to kind of get all the information you all have out in Such an easy and simple way.

691
00:46:50,848 --> 00:46:56,136
Speaker 1: and it's trivial to set up wiki's you can use like quickie wiki or Twickie and just set them up and they just work.

692
00:46:58,205 --> 00:47:01,609
Speaker 0: mmm, yet the I'm having a problem today.

693
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:02,959
Speaker 1: It's it's already late.

694
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:07,417
Speaker 1: We got we both though still I stayed in the city late to eat dinner and try to buy stuff.

695
00:47:07,918 --> 00:47:12,642
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, and get an hour and a half long haircut, but Good.

696
00:47:12,682 --> 00:47:13,547
Speaker 1: Well, I got the massage.

697
00:47:13,587 --> 00:47:14,090
Speaker 1: you go with it.

698
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,920
Speaker 1: And then the lady kept playing with my hair afterward.

699
00:47:16,622 --> 00:47:25,880
Speaker 0: The only other thing I got to say about wiki's is that the the main problem I see with them today Is that they require anyone to edit it to sort of learn the wiki language and the wiki?

700
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:33,958
Speaker 0: Well, the wiki language is not super complicated But it's not just you know, it's not so obvious to just you know, you can't.

701
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:36,790
Speaker 1: you can't Funny you because that's one of the concerns.

702
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,120
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm gonna talk someday about like Enterprise wiki.

703
00:47:39,261 --> 00:48:01,940
Speaker 1: I think that's definitely show we have to do now, but I I've been experimenting a lot with how to Make like one how to teach people who aren't super technological about this sort of thing How to deal with a wiki and how to make a wiki like in terms of setting up the initial like seeding the data That's already there and the data structures that are already there to make it intuitive for people to add to it.

704
00:48:02,543 --> 00:48:13,320
Speaker 1: and also I've been looking a lot into different kind of WYSIWYG editing solutions and it's not that difficult to make a wiki that is very accessible to people who are not technological.

705
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:15,329
Speaker 0: No, it's not that difficult.

706
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:23,000
Speaker 0: but like a lot of the WYSIWYG things I've seen are basically just like a string of buttons and then the buttons will put the wiki language in there.

707
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,170
Speaker 0: It's like it's no more helpful than like a button that puts in a P tag.

708
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,715
Speaker 1: Because that's not WYSIWYG.

709
00:48:28,317 --> 00:48:28,638
Speaker 1: I know.

710
00:48:28,678 --> 00:48:30,326
Speaker 1: By definition That's not WYSIWYG.

711
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:32,440
Speaker 0: I know but that's sort of you know, that's what I've seen.

712
00:48:32,521 --> 00:48:36,395
Speaker 1: Yeah But I actually say WYSIWYG because I found that actually the new version of Twiggy.

713
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:43,300
Speaker 1: just because this is like if you want to See it the newest version of Twiggy comes by default with a WYSIWYG editor on and it's pretty slick.

714
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,278
Speaker 1: I gotta say

715
00:48:45,103 --> 00:48:46,207
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm interesting,

716
00:48:46,810 --> 00:49:03,899
Speaker 1: but yeah next time you have to collaborate with people consider using a wiki and Someday, we'll do a show on the best practices of using wikis and kind of high-powered corporate enterprise, you know big-deal environments But let me know if you're interested in that and we might do that show sooner rather than much later.

717
00:49:04,322 --> 00:49:09,471
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the big the one big problem I think with wikis other than me having to learn the language thingies having

718
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:17,194
Speaker 1: the indigo children article on Wikipedia that I gave up on Fixing no after like two years of constantly editing that all

719
00:49:17,595 --> 00:49:26,580
Speaker 0: all the web server stuff behind Wikis setting them up making them work all that sort of stuff is actually not very polished even for media wiki.

720
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,427
Speaker 1: I'll say one thing.

721
00:49:27,447 --> 00:49:28,778
Speaker 1: there's two things I can say about that.

722
00:49:28,979 --> 00:49:41,691
Speaker 1: one What someone needs to make and I think that the VMware player and that sort of thing is making an opportunity for people to People who are altruistic to make Appliances that will just make the world a better place real quick.

723
00:49:41,751 --> 00:49:46,523
Speaker 1: and one of those things I think would be a fully functional Wiki appliance.

724
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:47,525
Speaker 1: hit play.

725
00:49:47,845 --> 00:49:49,849
Speaker 1: you've got a wiki ready to go.

726
00:49:49,949 --> 00:49:55,080
Speaker 1: just run it And those exist but a lot of them are not so great.

727
00:49:55,441 --> 00:50:00,580
Speaker 1: I was playing around with the Twiki one and it was okay, but it was depth by far not an optimal solution.

728
00:50:00,901 --> 00:50:02,689
Speaker 1: No, someone should do it better.

729
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:03,071
Speaker 1: Not me.

730
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:04,778
Speaker 1: I don't have time, but one of you out there.
