00:00:16,294 --> 00:00:17,990
Speaker 1: Tonight we talk a bit about raid.

5
00:00:23,182 --> 00:00:23,910
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:34,793
Speaker 0: Well for anyone who thinks that we are wizards of all technology I submit that I am only a wizard of digital technology.

7
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:38,208
Speaker 0: when it comes to analog technology I am the fail.

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:38,691
Speaker 1: how?

9
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:39,557
Speaker 1: so what did you do?

10
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:40,080
Speaker 0: well?

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,265
Speaker 0: I want to get a parking permit for the the beacon train station right and I hate Sending mail.

12
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:52,900
Speaker 0: just cuz I have to get a stamp and go to the post office and go out of my way And it kind of sucks, so I don't even open my mail anymore really.

13
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:55,014
Speaker 1: I just kind of let it pile up and then after a month.

14
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:55,840
Speaker 1: I kind of go through it.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,515
Speaker 0: I only know I know what like think certain mail looks like and I know what other mail looks like.

16
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:05,980
Speaker 0: so only certain mail gets Opened right away and certain mail just gets thrown out without even being open all my bills.

17
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,244
Speaker 1: Everything is electronic.

18
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:09,973
Speaker 1: the only things I get in the mail are wedding invitations.

19
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:14,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Get more packages than letters anyway.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,809
Speaker 0: So I don't want to mail them the application and they couldn't.

21
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,438
Speaker 0: I couldn't do it by internet or by phone or anything like that But I could do it by fax.

22
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:27,500
Speaker 0: So I filled out the form and faxed it to them on my own volition according to what their website said.

23
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:29,513
Speaker 1: All right, did you use a cover sheet?

24
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:30,117
Speaker 0: No?

25
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:32,079
Speaker 0: Such a thing existed.

26
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:38,780
Speaker 0: But anyway, they never ever responded to me, and I was lazy and the parking is relatively cheap here.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,765
Speaker 0: So I didn't care that much.

28
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:40,609
Speaker 0: and today.

29
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:41,212
Speaker 0: I said all right.

30
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:42,739
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try this again.

31
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:45,275
Speaker 0: So first I called them, and I was cuz.

32
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:47,145
Speaker 0: I was gonna say hey I'm about to fax you this.

33
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:50,460
Speaker 0: tell me if you get it right, so I'm like all right are there parking permits?

34
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:53,954
Speaker 0: Yes, we have permits, so I just my fax to the application.

35
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,099
Speaker 0: You'll send me the permit.

36
00:01:55,139 --> 00:02:02,189
Speaker 0: Yes That's what we'll do all right, and I realized when I when I did the faxing I went over to the fax machine with the filled out form.

37
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:02,772
Speaker 0: I put it in.

38
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:06,147
Speaker 1: did you put the paper in upside down and Fax them a blank sheet of paper.

39
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,739
Speaker 0: I punched in the phone number, and it just didn't work.

40
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,174
Speaker 0: It was like dee dee dee dee dee dee something.

41
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,902
Speaker 0: it made a shit ton of noise And it sucked.

42
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:17,699
Speaker 0: so someone next door who you know someone in the next cube or whatever who knew?

43
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,702
Speaker 0: How to use.

44
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:22,700
Speaker 0: the machine came over and he's like you got a good nine and then one?

45
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:26,088
Speaker 0: That's pretty obvious, and then the number.

46
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:29,720
Speaker 0: yeah, and also you're correct this fax machine.

47
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:33,600
Speaker 0: You have to put the piece of paper with the text facing away from you.

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:41,440
Speaker 1: You do realize that every fax machine or anything like that There's a little icon right there with the paper and that tells you which way the text.

49
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,248
Speaker 0: I think there was no such like it's there.

50
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:44,815
Speaker 1: I practically guarantee it.

51
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:49,220
Speaker 0: well anyway I had apparently previously faxed them a white sheet of paper.

52
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:50,665
Speaker 0: This time.

53
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:55,924
Speaker 1: well you know I realized that in that case the cover sheet wouldn't help you because it just would have been two Blank sheets of paper.

54
00:02:56,065 --> 00:03:05,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't believe the fax machine can even fax a blank piece of paper wouldn't it say hey That's a blank piece of paper there you realize how old and dumb fax technology is.

55
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,287
Speaker 0: it's such shit They really need to.

56
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:12,416
Speaker 0: people just need to like not PDFs attached to email at least come on.

57
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:19,776
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah I really and that's if you suck you really what you should have is some sort of Like document sharing sort of thing going on.

58
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:27,280
Speaker 1: well I actually I have to use fax machines pretty often, so I'm just used to them But I don't like them, and I can't really blame you for having trouble.

59
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,174
Speaker 0: It's not just fax machines that I can't use it's pretty much all analog devices.

60
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:34,120
Speaker 0: I just have a problem.

61
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,824
Speaker 1: Well your phone is digital.

62
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:37,168
Speaker 0: No my telephone.

63
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,274
Speaker 0: Yes, but like landline phones.

64
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:41,560
Speaker 0: I'm no good like voicemails not so good.

65
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:43,007
Speaker 1: What trouble?

66
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:45,520
Speaker 1: can you have a voicemail leave a message beep message?

67
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,504
Speaker 0: I always like leave.

68
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:50,440
Speaker 0: I always like fail to delete the voicemail or accidentally save it.

69
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:53,873
Speaker 1: Ah, I thought you meant you have trouble using other people's voicemail.

70
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:56,505
Speaker 1: like you get the voicemail You just don't know what to do.

71
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:58,396
Speaker 0: Oh and when it cut that's the other thing.

72
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,180
Speaker 0: It's like my cell phone.

73
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,958
Speaker 0: I'm alright because it has like menus and things like that the phones at work even though they're voip.

74
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:05,790
Speaker 0: It's like I can't do.

75
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:06,918
Speaker 0: I can barely make a call.

76
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:12,136
Speaker 0: Actually my current company unlike IBM transferring a phone call give up.

77
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,039
Speaker 0: I can't do it.

78
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:17,500
Speaker 1: There was everything was out like there were documents on the website.

79
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:22,680
Speaker 1: So if I need to know how to dial internally in the PBX is and all that I could just go to this website.

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,132
Speaker 1: It would say you know dial six seven to call this facility and blah blah blah.

81
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:28,140
Speaker 1: then the extension and my current work?

82
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:31,810
Speaker 1: No, there's really no documentation for it at all.

83
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:38,139
Speaker 1: so I realized one day that I had no idea how to call anyone Anywhere other than with the full phone number.

84
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:44,037
Speaker 1: So I ended up always going nine one area code phone number to call someone in the cubicle down from me.

85
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:47,530
Speaker 0: yeah, I Think that's the one thing I do know.

86
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:50,660
Speaker 0: if it's you know someone's extension You can pretty much just type the extension.

87
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,526
Speaker 1: It'll work only if you work in a really small place because usually there'll be a bunch of different sites or different Categories different areas.

88
00:04:57,868 --> 00:04:58,370
Speaker 1: like an IBM.

89
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,500
Speaker 1: you had to dial for to get some people's extensions.

90
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,974
Speaker 1: You had to dial three four to get other people's extensions.

91
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,560
Speaker 1: Ah Yeah, I've never worked at a small company.

92
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,248
Speaker 0: But in that case right the extension would be like.

93
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:14,304
Speaker 0: if your extension was like 100 right and they were I would just on my Business card.

94
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:18,119
Speaker 0: I would make my extension three four X 100 or something like that.

95
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:22,173
Speaker 1: Yeah But that doesn't help because you never give your business card to the internal people.

96
00:05:22,193 --> 00:05:29,999
Speaker 1: as for the external people we give the real phone Number that connects you to the outside world I'm talking about if I have to call Bob and receiving to find out if my package came.

97
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:41,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I know his big phone number, and I know his extension But I don't know which number I have to append or prepend or whatever to get to that extension short of dialing the whole Thing at work.

98
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:50,198
Speaker 0: They actually do have a pretty cool system where I am now where like my extension until before the phone broke was 666 right because it was the phone from the conference room.

99
00:05:50,218 --> 00:06:00,947
Speaker 0: and If you want to call that phone It's like phone number phone numbers 666 and it's like they actually just got real phone numbers that end with the Extension for each and every phone.

100
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:03,218
Speaker 0: so everyone sort of has their own phone number.

101
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:08,960
Speaker 0: as opposed You can also call the main phone number and then dial the extension or you within the office just the extension.

102
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,364
Speaker 0: But it's pretty cool because you have a real full phone number where the last four digits happen to be your extension And that's neat.

103
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:19,296
Speaker 1: so the very least you think you got the faxes under control now.

104
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:20,220
Speaker 1: You think you could send a fax.

105
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,349
Speaker 0: I think I can send a fax.

106
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:22,580
Speaker 0: We'll see if I get a parking permit.

107
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:25,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just sent a bunch of faxes a little while ago.

108
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:27,456
Speaker 1: actually yeah earlier today.

109
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:28,660
Speaker 0: fax machines need to die.

110
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:33,720
Speaker 0: There's a reason that like cool people like when they get faxes they automatically go into email.

111
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:37,774
Speaker 0: Well the thing is one day people get up like an email with a PDF.

112
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:44,657
Speaker 0: They're gonna push the fax button It's gonna go over the telephone line to someone else's end where it gets turned into an email with a PDF.

113
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:50,887
Speaker 1: the reason faxes still exist seems to be that people For some reason trust signatures.

114
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:55,520
Speaker 1: still so if you want to send an official document to someone they always want you to fax it.

115
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:03,919
Speaker 1: That way they've got a copy of your signature Which is just a scribble that anyone could duplicate and handwriting analysis is pretty much made up.

116
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:07,140
Speaker 1: Meanwhile they don't trust electronic signatures.

117
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:11,674
Speaker 1: You know like a PGP signing or a GPG that which is perfect it.

118
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:11,875
Speaker 1: Well.

119
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:12,517
Speaker 1: It's not perfect.

120
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:13,440
Speaker 0: It's effectively perfect.

121
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's effectively perfect.

122
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:24,804
Speaker 1: It's so much more provable that I did or did not sign something with that than it is with a blurry scribble on a piece of paper that I Sent over an analog phone line.

123
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:29,756
Speaker 1: well technically most phone lines convert to digital anyway, but you get the point yep.

124
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:35,716
Speaker 1: anyway in the news There's a story about a blogger getting kicked out of an NCAA game for blogging.

125
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:36,579
Speaker 1: live at the event.

126
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:39,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's actually whether you know it or not.

127
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:45,560
Speaker 0: It's sort of illegal to cover sporting events if you are like licensed to do it like if you go to a football game.

128
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:51,257
Speaker 0: It's technically illegal to like call someone on the phone and tell them what's happening at the game while it happens.

129
00:07:51,337 --> 00:08:04,979
Speaker 0: like there was a problem With that where people would watch a game on TV in an area where there was a blackout and then they would set up a pirate radio station and Like call the game as they watched it on TV.

130
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,379
Speaker 0: So people in the blackout area could listen to it on the radio and a lot of people got busted for that.

131
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:12,567
Speaker 1: Yep, now the story itself is kind of sensationalistic.

132
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:14,552
Speaker 1: It wasn't just oh he's blogging.

133
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:20,980
Speaker 1: they actually were specifically prohibited from blogging live Ahead of time and decided to try and do it anyway.

134
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,854
Speaker 1: I pretty much just ignore the headlines and digger slash data.

135
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:30,029
Speaker 1: I just read the comments and find out There's always the one comment right away that says what actually happened.

136
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:43,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just noticed this trend lately where it's like people Seem to think that you know if they think that something should be free like yes You should be free to blog whatever you want, but you know, it's not illegal I agree.

137
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:52,349
Speaker 0: But when there's things that are specifically prohibited like you cannot bring a camera into this concert People are starting to like take a little too far.

138
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,718
Speaker 0: and it's like no that it really is prohibited.

139
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:57,008
Speaker 0: and yes They do have a right to prohibit that.

140
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,600
Speaker 0: and no you don't have a right to go in there.

141
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,400
Speaker 0: And yes, they can just take away your ticket.

142
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:03,311
Speaker 0: You better listen to them or the?

143
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:04,619
Speaker 0: I have no sympathy for you.

144
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:17,277
Speaker 1: but yet at the same time all of this that they do is Obviously nothing more than trying to control and protect their revenue stream, which is based solely on Selling the information that is being generated at these events.

145
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,422
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like.

146
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:22,880
Speaker 0: I agree that if I was them I would not have the same policy the same way.

147
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,216
Speaker 0: you know people like the Grateful Dead don't have the same policy and it works out really well because you're not stupid.

148
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:32,751
Speaker 0: but the It's not wrong for them to have it.

149
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:33,695
Speaker 0: It's not evil.

150
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:37,734
Speaker 0: It's not unconstitutional It's perfectly legal and right in every way.

151
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:38,800
Speaker 0: They're allowed to do that.

152
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:47,420
Speaker 1: Well, I think you should be allowed more down to the issue that Originally back in the day when they made all these rules and decided like oh we're going to not let people see you.

153
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,098
Speaker 1: Well, make sure they don't sneak recording equipment in.

154
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:55,380
Speaker 1: Recording equipment was big and expensive and heavy and easy to see and not many people had it.

155
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,913
Speaker 1: It was hard to get away with that sort of stuff.

156
00:09:57,457 --> 00:10:07,119
Speaker 0: now everyone's phone is Connected to the internet and as a camera and as a video camera and as a recorder and things are getting smaller.

157
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:12,444
Speaker 1: and again I mean even I remember I used to go to Red Wings games a lot as a kid and my mom Had that.

158
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:25,710
Speaker 1: the rule was kind of complicated where you couldn't have Bigger than a certain size lens if you came to a hockey game Because they wanted to sell you the official pictures of the game Instead of letting you take high-quality ones on your own.

159
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,003
Speaker 0: and also the only people allowed to take high-quality photos like press Photographers and things like.

160
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:39,788
Speaker 1: well, my mom had a very very small looking camera, but when you turned it on it went and Was an ad.

161
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:46,260
Speaker 1: I mean it wasn't an SLR crazy camera But it was super super high quality and way beyond the rule.

162
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:56,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, and every time we go to a hockey game They'd look at it and it said how big the lens wasn't all that stuff on the front But she just put some tape over that and they'd look at it and they didn't know anything about cameras.

163
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,823
Speaker 1: They just let her in.

164
00:10:57,385 --> 00:11:00,719
Speaker 1: but one day they said hey, wait a minute turn that camera on.

165
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:00,940
Speaker 1: it went.

166
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,530
Speaker 1: They said alright, you can't bring that camera in.

167
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:05,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, go put it in your car.

168
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:11,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, uh, she just walks right over to a line like two doors down and just walks in there.

169
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,164
Speaker 1: nice Like there's just.

170
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:19,600
Speaker 1: there's no way to prevent this sort of thing from happening No matter how many rules you make no matter how many people you arrest.

171
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:30,940
Speaker 1: I mean, it's cliche to say that information wants to be free But at the same time people want to make information free and will take great risks and go to great lengths to do so.

172
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:38,340
Speaker 0: But at the same time While I agree with everything you just said I have no sympathy for the guy sitting in the movie theater with the video camera.

173
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:38,975
Speaker 1: No, no.

174
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:42,300
Speaker 0: And he says this is this is oppression.

175
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:48,980
Speaker 0: They kicked me out of the movie theater for videotaping the movie and I'll say yeah, cuz you can't do that dumbass.

176
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:57,025
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time if someone was at a baseball game and they were typing up blog posts about the baseball game or covering The baseball game on their own.

177
00:11:57,707 --> 00:12:08,308
Speaker 1: it does bother me that you could have a monopoly on the factual Press coverage of an event, but at the same time it's technically a private event But yet then you're broadcasting the event public.

178
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:08,990
Speaker 1: I mean technically.

179
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,492
Speaker 0: well, they don't.

180
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:18,520
Speaker 0: they don't have a monopoly on the press coverage but it's that you are prohibited from Like because the you have to do it with a press pass.

181
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:19,942
Speaker 1: Here's my.

182
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:25,440
Speaker 1: alright, so they they don't want not like non approved press from coming in and doing this.

183
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,360
Speaker 0: No, it's not that they don't want not approved press.

184
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,802
Speaker 0: They don't care.

185
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:31,395
Speaker 0: what you say about the baseball game of the basketball game is that they don't care.

186
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:36,419
Speaker 0: they care about you Telling people what's happening while the game is going on.

187
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,773
Speaker 0: Don't want you to confess with the TV and the radio.

188
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:40,960
Speaker 1: No, that's not where I was going with this.

189
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,238
Speaker 1: All right, so all right.

190
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,155
Speaker 1: so to prevent this they have all these rules about how you can't broadcast stuff out of the stadium or whatever.

191
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:53,836
Speaker 1: what if Happen to have a geosynchronous satellite over the stadium and I just have a real-time camera pointed at it.

192
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:59,772
Speaker 1: I'm not in the stadium I'm just filming something from public property and I happen to be distributing it on the internet.

193
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:02,599
Speaker 1: Yeah now could they go after me?

194
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,406
Speaker 0: Where are you space?

195
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,211
Speaker 0: Are you in space?

196
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:08,234
Speaker 1: I'm not in space.

197
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,156
Speaker 1: Where's your company?

198
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:10,520
Speaker 1: No, no company.

199
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,639
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that you were filming something that is publicly viewable from a public space.

200
00:13:16,683 --> 00:13:18,639
Speaker 0: See, there's nothing wrong with the filming it.

201
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,650
Speaker 0: it's that they wouldn't care about that.

202
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,104
Speaker 0: the thing that they would get you for is the Distribution of it without expressed written consent.

203
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:26,426
Speaker 1: but yet photography.

204
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:31,988
Speaker 1: if you take a picture of something from public space and There was no reasonable expectation of privacy.

205
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:33,875
Speaker 1: Then you can distribute that picture all you want.

206
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:39,212
Speaker 1: Yes, you could You know, you know depending somewhat on the country and our state you live in.

207
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:45,534
Speaker 0: but yeah, the other thing is that Watching a baseball game from space not too exciting.

208
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,100
Speaker 1: Hey, I'm zoomed in enough.

209
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,120
Speaker 1: I mean there's gonna be some bit of delay until we get some sort of quantum transport device.

210
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:52,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, they're just.

211
00:13:52,905 --> 00:14:05,439
Speaker 0: they're gonna use every legal means necessary to just because they make an agreement with like a TV company saying you Will be the only people broadcasting this in these areas and they make an agreement with the radio station saying you will be the only people to you know.

212
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:10,980
Speaker 0: Share this information live as it happens in these areas and you'll be the only website to do, you know.

213
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:25,041
Speaker 0: So if they don't want you to be able to compete with those exclusive agreements Without paying up That's all they're trying to prevent so that people don't not watch TV and not listen to the radio and instead go to your pirate Website.

214
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:29,313
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time f1 in the very least has shown us why this fails.

215
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:31,800
Speaker 0: because f1 is a prime example.

216
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:43,560
Speaker 1: There are people who want to cover it and people who want to see it but it's not easy to see and it's not easy to get and All the coverage is really exclusive and hard to find and you really have to pirate it or pay a lot of money.

217
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,189
Speaker 0: Yep, the way because the way f1 is done is there's a company.

218
00:14:47,290 --> 00:15:08,045
Speaker 0: the guy who sort of runs the business side of the FIA is Bernie Ecclestone Ecclestone everyone to say it and he owns this a lot of companies but this broadcasting company and every f1 race has this same people filming it and So in every single country in the world like the US Germany France Italy It doesn't matter.

219
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:14,774
Speaker 0: if you're watching the f1 race You're all seeing the exact same cameras the people who are calling the race.

220
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:22,240
Speaker 0: the announcers are different for each country Of course because different languages and everything and they're watching the same video feed that you're watching.

221
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:25,308
Speaker 0: They're not like looking around They're not at the track.

222
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:30,540
Speaker 0: usually unless the you know They happen the the race happens to be in your country and they're watching this.

223
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:32,351
Speaker 0: everyone's watching the same video feed.

224
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:35,528
Speaker 0: you're watching and just talking and It kind of sucks.

225
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:42,540
Speaker 0: because the people announcing, you know Usually they like to have some coordination with the people who control the cameras like hey, we'd really like to see that.

226
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,707
Speaker 0: Hey, we'd really like to see that.

227
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:44,512
Speaker 0: Why don't we look over there?

228
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:58,079
Speaker 0: when I look over there, you know If you're in Spain, you want to see what the Spanish drivers are doing if you're in France You want to see the French driver is doing not Show everyone in the entire world the same exact thing and it doesn't really work out and it's not HD.

229
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,791
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I just think that is actually hurting the sport.

230
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:07,000
Speaker 1: It's hurting it tremendously, but they don't seem to realize Helping their wallets tremendously.

231
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:15,307
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I mean, maybe they don't realize that it could be more popular But I think they do realize that what they're doing now makes them a lot of money So they probably don't care they.

232
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,480
Speaker 0: I don't think they care about f1 being popular.

233
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,715
Speaker 0: They're sort of like with the pomp and the.

234
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:27,080
Speaker 0: you know The prestige and all that highfalutin business and they're really big, you know, they don't really want a bajillion fans.

235
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:33,476
Speaker 0: They want few very rich and snooty fans Because that's what they are the few rich and the snooty.

236
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:34,020
Speaker 1: of course.

237
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:42,901
Speaker 1: I guess the moral here is uh Do everything you can to pirate sporting events then broadcast them to the world, but don't complain if you get busted because yeah You're not.

238
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:46,616
Speaker 1: well complain about the policy, but don't complain about the fact that you got caught.

239
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:56,188
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not a policy I would implement but it is a fair and you gotta be like I'm a bootlegger, baby.

240
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,013
Speaker 1: Yeah.

241
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,916
Speaker 0: Oh I have a news also So I'm just gonna say this really quick.

242
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:05,659
Speaker 0: Is that Apple announced that they're putting out Safari for Windows?

243
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,126
Speaker 0: and There's not much I got to say about that.

244
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:11,700
Speaker 1: Nah, I don't see the market because there aren't many people I get.

245
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:22,359
Speaker 1: I. the only people I could see caring about this are people who have either a Windows laptop or Work in a company that doesn't have Macs which means work at a company.

246
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:26,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you're a web developer and you want to see how your website works.

247
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:33,074
Speaker 1: I was just saying they use Macs at home and it bothers them that they can't get their Safari anywhere else.

248
00:17:33,355 --> 00:17:40,764
Speaker 0: Here's the thing Safari runs in this the same web browsing rendering engine that Conqueror does.

249
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:47,656
Speaker 0: it's very fast and it's got some niceness to it like the custom widgets that match your you know OS widget set and stuff like that.

250
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:57,674
Speaker 0: But and it's it's fairly standards compliant very standards compliant in many cases But a lot of things don't work in it and it's not really all that useful.

251
00:17:57,754 --> 00:18:05,720
Speaker 0: and like the tabs in Safari are all not Even half as good as the Firefox tabs and it just is it does not any extensions for it really.

252
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:13,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I honestly I ranked Safari third after well, obviously Firefox Number one and then after opera.

253
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:20,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, an opera is really The only reason I don't use opera because it is faster and has a little better set than Firefox.

254
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:23,400
Speaker 0: extensions Extensions and the keyboard shortcuts are off.

255
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:30,698
Speaker 1: I honestly opera had a use when we use the Mac before we realized that we can just zoom in straight up because it has.

256
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:35,440
Speaker 0: the Opera has the better zooming function where it actually resizes the images as well as the text.

257
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:42,354
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you might as well just go one step further if you're zooming in anyway And just use actual zoom in on your desktop technology.

258
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:46,168
Speaker 0: Yep, but yeah Safaris not that great a browser.

259
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:53,517
Speaker 0: It's gonna have a real hard time competing with because on the Mac It doesn't really have to compete because Mac users either use that or Firefox.

260
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:54,160
Speaker 0: There's no IE.

261
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,087
Speaker 0: No one uses opera on the Mac.

262
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:57,452
Speaker 0: that that's just stupid.

263
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:58,998
Speaker 0: and on Windows.

264
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:02,726
Speaker 0: You've got Firefox IE7 which isn't that bad?

265
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:08,931
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used it a little bit since I'm still having troubles with Linux So I keep ending up in Windows and I tried it.

266
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:10,838
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like the advantage ie has.

267
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:11,983
Speaker 0: in Windows It's pre-installed.

268
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:14,713
Speaker 0: the advantage Safari has in Mac is pre-installed.

269
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:21,155
Speaker 0: if Safari is not pre-installed You're gonna have a hard time beating Firefox which is also not pre-installed.

270
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,520
Speaker 0: Yeah and better.

271
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:26,980
Speaker 0: Oh, well, but yet the actual news I want to talk about is this drobo thing.

272
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,823
Speaker 0: Drobo drobo.

273
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:34,360
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if it stands for disk robot or drive robot, but there's nothing robotic about it.

274
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:35,989
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty obvious.

275
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:36,713
Speaker 1: stands for dr.

276
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:37,216
Speaker 1: Abbot.

277
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:42,946
Speaker 0: Oh obviously that bastard Him and his doctor about.

278
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:43,308
Speaker 0: okay.

279
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:45,837
Speaker 0: Anyway, the basically this is a box.

280
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:52,227
Speaker 0: It's pretty fancy if you've ever wanted to set up like a raid or some sort of storage array or like.

281
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:57,840
Speaker 0: you have a whole lot of hard drives mainly for because that's all it can hold and You want to turn them into one big hard drive?

282
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,420
Speaker 0: This thing does it from a user interface perspective better than anything else has ever done it?

283
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:09,993
Speaker 1: Yeah from the way Scott described it to me Thusly plug four drives into it and then plug the USB in.

284
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,620
Speaker 0: that's pretty much all you have to do.

285
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:13,986
Speaker 0: It's got four holes for force here.

286
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:15,590
Speaker 0: any serial ATA drive will work.

287
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:23,476
Speaker 0: any serial ATA drive any any and you plug them in you just slide them right in there and it has lights for each one.

288
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:30,464
Speaker 0: and When the drive is sort of like doing its business the light will be sort of yellow like hey This drive isn't ready.

289
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:32,071
Speaker 0: yet when the drive is ready.

290
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:34,682
Speaker 0: It's green and when the drive is broken It's red.

291
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:39,340
Speaker 0: and if the light is red you just take the drive out and put a new drive in the spot.

292
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:42,886
Speaker 1: so what kind of striping a raid or whatever does it do?

293
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:43,608
Speaker 1: because doesn't?

294
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:50,016
Speaker 1: obviously it has some sort of parity because otherwise a Broken drive you wouldn't just swap it out.

295
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:50,700
Speaker 1: You'd be fucked.

296
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:54,975
Speaker 0: It doesn't use any of the like the raids that we know it like.

297
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:56,381
Speaker 0: it's not just a raid 5.

298
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,433
Speaker 0: It's not just a raid 6.

299
00:20:58,433 --> 00:20:59,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like great six.

300
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:13,120
Speaker 0: It's something else that is not known to us but it can be that way because it's like it's a special box that does things its own special way and It doesn't have to be something that we know about because it's sort of like this.

301
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:14,826
Speaker 0: It just works what you know.

302
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:20,834
Speaker 0: and while I like things to be open source and well-known if it just works What the hell do I care as long as it works?

303
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:21,620
Speaker 1: Yeah?

304
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:28,580
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not like unless they had secret firmware that would look for credit card numbers on your hard drive.

305
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,527
Speaker 0: But you plug this thing into your computer.

306
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:34,260
Speaker 0: It just sees it as a normal external USB hard drive.

307
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:44,375
Speaker 1: I guess all I want I would wait for is I want what I want is that thing that little four-way spider With a serial ATA hole or a SCSI hole on the end instead of USB.

308
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:53,960
Speaker 0: Yes, they're going to make ones supposedly with with ES ATAs or Fire wires or something else and better USB is probably what I really want.

309
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,520
Speaker 0: The only problem I have with this device is that it's an external hard drive as opposed to a network attached hard drive.

310
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:02,540
Speaker 1: Yeah If only it had like an RJ45 and a little web server.

311
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,970
Speaker 0: What you have to do with this is you have to plug this into a computer that on that computer You have to make a file server of some sort.

312
00:22:09,352 --> 00:22:10,820
Speaker 0: It should have the file server in it.

313
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,740
Speaker 0: So I just plug it into my router put it next to my router and now every computer on my network can read and write To it like it's some sort of network drive.

314
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:21,723
Speaker 1: See sadly Scott and I for the longest time were Planning like.

315
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:26,880
Speaker 1: we kept like periodically looking at the prices of hard drives and sans and nazis and all those things.

316
00:22:27,202 --> 00:22:29,660
Speaker 1: We wanted a gigantic file server.

317
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:37,740
Speaker 1: We could put all our music all our everything other than our personal files on it back everything up to it put geek nights on It and be our permanent storage in the house forever.

318
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:40,460
Speaker 1: But every time it always cost a little bit too much.

319
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,258
Speaker 1: We didn't worry about it.

320
00:22:41,802 --> 00:22:53,297
Speaker 1: And now I realize that with my new computer once I get the motherboard working fully I think I'm just gonna build a big raid 5 in my computer and use that Because it's so much cheaper than any other solution out there.

321
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,283
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

322
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:57,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus I got these 10 saders.

323
00:22:57,832 --> 00:22:58,795
Speaker 1: I gotta use them for something.

324
00:22:59,257 --> 00:23:00,864
Speaker 0: You don't have to use it I have to.

325
00:23:01,185 --> 00:23:03,677
Speaker 1: it bothers me that I have all these saders and I'm not using any of them.

326
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:04,160
Speaker 1: I'm using you.

327
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:17,012
Speaker 0: It's a big thing on in gadget here that compares all the the features of raid 5 with the features of the Drobo and the Drobo is sort of slightly better in some ways and Equal and others and I'll have to read that.

328
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:33,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty cool And it the coolest thing about it I like is the lights on it because you know as the lights that tell you if a drive is working or not It has these blue lights at the bottom where as you're filling up your storage space more blue lights will turn on and as you You know, if you take a drive out put a bigger one in.

329
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:33,875
Speaker 0: they'll try it.

330
00:23:33,915 --> 00:23:34,900
Speaker 0: the lights kind of turn off.

331
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,079
Speaker 0: So you have a visual thing looking at it how much space is left to put data on?

332
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:52,554
Speaker 0: It also has some other things that tell you like how hot the box is in case it's overheating and stuff like that All with just colored and nicely shaped and positioned LEDs Which is more than a lot of those expensive NASA's have huh?

333
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:56,068
Speaker 0: And the thing is only five hundred dollars Which is not bad at all.

334
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:58,600
Speaker 1: five hundred dollars without drives without drives.

335
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:05,255
Speaker 0: But a lot of those NASA's that are not as good as this except for the fact that they have file sir Oh except for the fact that they have the one thing we need.

336
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:13,097
Speaker 0: but they're also normal raid and not the superior Drobo thing and they also don't have the Helpful LEDs and they also are a pain in the ass to get to work.

337
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:14,844
Speaker 1: Oh Superior is it?

338
00:24:14,884 --> 00:24:15,607
Speaker 1: I mean are there bad?

339
00:24:15,627 --> 00:24:17,815
Speaker 1: they have benchmarks showing performance differences.

340
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:19,040
Speaker 0: Oh, they've got all this.

341
00:24:19,321 --> 00:24:19,803
Speaker 1: What about?

342
00:24:19,903 --> 00:24:21,610
Speaker 1: how does it affect the MTBF?

343
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,180
Speaker 1: because different kinds of raid are?

344
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,382
Speaker 1: varying have varying levels of Stress.

345
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:32,560
Speaker 1: they put on drives and raid tends to kill drives and better raid tends to kill drives more quickly.

346
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:36,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, well is the whole thing about it on engage it that you can read?

347
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,920
Speaker 1: I got it Because I really would wonder how reliable it is and it seems pretty good to me.

348
00:24:41,020 --> 00:25:04,588
Speaker 0: I think some of the best features are like it works with only one drive but you need at least two drives for redundancy and the Whereas if you unarrayed five like the redundancy overhead if you have like four two hundred and fifty gig drives you get a seven hundred and fifty gig array, but with a Drobo to 250 gig drives and to 500 gig drives is a one terabyte array.

349
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:10,280
Speaker 0: you see That's interesting.

350
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:20,048
Speaker 1: yeah, but I wonder because that means that there's some sort of the distributing parity in a different way or it's not symmetrical and I wonder if that wouldn't put a lot more stress on the drives.

351
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:21,392
Speaker 0: I don't know.

352
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:36,335
Speaker 1: but or either that or what hurt the performance It could hurt the performance but that you know what the problem is It's impossible to tell because you as limited by USB I'll bet I'll bet that it because it's on USB 2 is the only reason it's better.

353
00:25:36,655 --> 00:25:42,800
Speaker 1: and if you weren't limited by that I think you'd see a serious performance deficit compared to standard raid.

354
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,970
Speaker 0: Yeah But here's the thing.

355
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:49,460
Speaker 0: if you are The kind of person who's gonna buy this is a home user who wants to store their photos or the videos of the music.

356
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,799
Speaker 0: You don't need fucking performance on that.

357
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:55,710
Speaker 0: It's not like some giant database hosting god-knows-what.

358
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,315
Speaker 0: for that you get like a sad or something.

359
00:25:57,616 --> 00:26:03,059
Speaker 0: if you're just storing your photos It's gonna take less than a second to store the photo over the USB to no matter what.

360
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:11,837
Speaker 1: so But at the same time performance at the same time Those people are the people who are much less likely to buy this strange contraption.

361
00:26:12,198 --> 00:26:15,149
Speaker 0: and then well That's the thing is that this is a nice friendly box.

362
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:15,751
Speaker 0: I mean look at that.

363
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:18,000
Speaker 0: It's like it's not some strange contraption.

364
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:29,060
Speaker 0: It's targeted trying to get people who you know have a whole bunch of photos or whatever and just want to you know A nice only kind of thing, but then those people have to buy four of these big ugly metal boxy things.

365
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,466
Speaker 0: You just buy two plus.

366
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,780
Speaker 0: a lot of people are like selling it in packages with drives and things like that.

367
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:34,975
Speaker 1: So now that's a good idea.

368
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:40,880
Speaker 1: Yeah I just think that the target audience of this wouldn't really be willing to buy hard drives might have difficulty.

369
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:49,259
Speaker 0: I think the target audience is sort of those middle people like You know people who don't know as much about like as much about technology as we do.

370
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:55,300
Speaker 0: But they're you know, the kind of people who down have like a hundred DVDs of burned fan subs.

371
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,260
Speaker 0: But they don't know shit about computers.

372
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:58,528
Speaker 0: but they know how to do.

373
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:05,560
Speaker 0: they know how to do this and they're always Complaining about how their raids don't work and they want they keep asking us how they should partition their drives.

374
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:07,339
Speaker 0: Those people are gonna buy this thing.

375
00:27:07,422 --> 00:27:12,347
Speaker 1: Yeah I thought those people just burned everything to DVD and then made gigantic Spindles that they never opened again.

376
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:14,959
Speaker 0: Well now they're gonna buy like three drobos instead.

377
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:22,069
Speaker 1: god I remember there's this one kid at RIT always came to the club and he had You know those like 200 CD spindles you can buy.

378
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:22,471
Speaker 1: Yep.

379
00:27:22,732 --> 00:27:27,267
Speaker 1: He had two of those full of CDs With burned anime.

380
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:30,980
Speaker 1: I never understood those people and they were in his dorm room covered in dust.

381
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:33,590
Speaker 0: Why do you save?

382
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,038
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

383
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:42,043
Speaker 1: Well, even the fact that he saved him on a medium where it was almost impossible to get any given episode you wanted out Of that mess, you know It's like.

384
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:49,240
Speaker 0: I don't even understand the people who collect Physical things like just collect them like collect comic books to have not to read but to have.

385
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:52,859
Speaker 0: So I really don't understand someone who collects digital non-physical things.

386
00:27:53,543 --> 00:27:56,680
Speaker 1: I can understand people who collect just to have if they're historians.

387
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:03,920
Speaker 0: Well, yes Because then you're actually getting a purpose out of it not just to have as in just to have not for any other purpose.

388
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:09,600
Speaker 1: But I thought when I bought a hundred copies of Cyclops and Jean Grey getting married that I was making an investment?

389
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:21,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure Things of the day.

390
00:28:21,772 --> 00:28:28,290
Speaker 1: So, uh, we really don't like American Idol and all of the sort of effluvia surrounding that business.

391
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:30,598
Speaker 0: I don't even watch TV.

392
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:37,330
Speaker 0: So there's definitely no way I'm gonna be in on this reality TV Which is really just a fancy way of saying New Age game show.

393
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:38,875
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I didn't.

394
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:55,502
Speaker 1: what really bothered me about American Idol because it was off and on when I went to go get My laundry or whatever would be that the singing was usually really bad and it was kind of this Warbly modern can't hold a note for any given amount of time.

395
00:28:55,522 --> 00:28:57,950
Speaker 1: They were all singing the same kind of music.

396
00:28:58,551 --> 00:28:58,792
Speaker 1: I didn't.

397
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:01,886
Speaker 1: the show just was really painful and it bothered me.

398
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:02,408
Speaker 1: I didn't like it.

399
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,576
Speaker 0: I'm much more a fan of what was that show?

400
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,242
Speaker 0: star search that old one.

401
00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:08,450
Speaker 1: Yeah any any kind of old variety show?

402
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:08,972
Speaker 1: I like.

403
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:09,877
Speaker 0: yeah, I like those.

404
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:11,909
Speaker 1: In fact, I wish there were variety shows.

405
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:15,610
Speaker 0: I think there are but just they're not so much in the US anymore.

406
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:16,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, not so much in the US.

407
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:20,263
Speaker 1: But anyway, we caught this clip on YouTube.

408
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:22,795
Speaker 1: wasn't from American Idol or something else I think it was.

409
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,215
Speaker 0: they said it was from like Something Britain.

410
00:29:26,696 --> 00:29:29,627
Speaker 1: see that would make sense because they're a little bit more cultured on the other side.

411
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:38,953
Speaker 1: Yep So at least as far as the accents would lead us to believe I think we've talked about that before God, I should.

412
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:42,390
Speaker 1: I'll have to tell that anecdote about that pocket watch and what it did to us at the wedding.

413
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:44,681
Speaker 0: All right, but anyway do anything to me?

414
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:45,786
Speaker 1: Well, I did.

415
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:46,349
Speaker 1: you didn't have it.

416
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:51,034
Speaker 1: You were not forced to speak in a terrible British accent while holding a pocket watch up Constantly.

417
00:29:51,094 --> 00:29:53,790
Speaker 0: if I had a pocket watch I would not speak in a terrible British accent.

418
00:29:53,911 --> 00:29:55,821
Speaker 1: You have to it's part of having a pocket watch.

419
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,269
Speaker 1: It's one step away from a monocle.

420
00:29:57,651 --> 00:29:59,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I had a monocle, I wouldn't.

421
00:29:59,157 --> 00:30:00,423
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be all British though.

422
00:30:00,443 --> 00:30:03,939
Speaker 0: I would be all railroad tycoon Ah equally good equally good.

423
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:06,270
Speaker 1: I do say the railroad blub anyway.

424
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:11,649
Speaker 1: So this guy comes out and says I'm going to sing some opera for you and everyone goes, huh?

425
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,890
Speaker 1: And he sings opera pretty damn well.

426
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:20,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I. the thing was is like I was going backwards through the dig videos.

427
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:31,582
Speaker 0: So there was a video of Pavarotti singing the same song and then I go back two pages and then there's this guy and I'm like, oh They posted the Pavarotti because they saw this one.

428
00:30:31,602 --> 00:30:36,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see what you did there So it wasn't so impressive.

429
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:42,510
Speaker 0: after watch it's like watching Michael Schumacher drive and then watching some guy drive the same course.

430
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:44,756
Speaker 1: Granted it was still very impressive.

431
00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:50,176
Speaker 0: It was it was you look at the guy and you're like, alright, you're gonna sing opera Let's see this.

432
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:54,750
Speaker 0: and then you're like, oh, hey He was no Pavarotti, but it was pretty damn good.

433
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:06,350
Speaker 1: And I got to say I was happy that the audience reacted positively very positively Which was somewhat surprising because most people I talked to express in the least a mild dislike of opera.

434
00:31:06,872 --> 00:31:08,920
Speaker 1: Not many people I know are fans of opera.

435
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,324
Speaker 0: I think what it is is a lot of people You'd say they don't like opera don't know about it.

436
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:14,847
Speaker 1: Never seen.

437
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:17,335
Speaker 0: actually Really listen to it.

438
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:21,548
Speaker 1: or or there are people who liked opera and then went to see fucking God.

439
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,270
Speaker 1: or Dammer on.

440
00:31:22,551 --> 00:31:23,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, that thing is.

441
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,920
Speaker 0: I thought it was Dammer on.

442
00:31:26,482 --> 00:31:29,130
Speaker 1: it's the the you know, the the the last of the Ring cycle.

443
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:36,129
Speaker 1: Yeah and everybody dies and it's just freaking long and the overture takes forever and it just it won't end and it just keeps going.

444
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:37,753
Speaker 1: and I fell asleep twice.

445
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:38,495
Speaker 1: Ah,

446
00:31:39,197 --> 00:32:02,121
Speaker 0: I saw the Romeo and Juliet opera once like the afternoon at Lincoln Center And the only problem I had with it is that okay, you know, everyone sings really well, that's cool You know and it's Romeo and Juliet, which is also cool and it's in Italian Which normally I'd have no problem with but it's in Italian and I kind of want to know what they're saying Even though I could kind of guess I'd like to know.

447
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:07,590
Speaker 1: well, you know good opera house They either give you a libretto with translations or they have the little screen.

448
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:16,418
Speaker 0: they have the little LED readout on the chair in front of you and you you can't see anyone else's because the angle the Viewing angle of them is exactly straight on.

449
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:23,270
Speaker 0: so you only see your own and if you look over the shoulder of the person In front of you, you can see theirs and you just like one row of them all the way down to the front.

450
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,895
Speaker 0: But and I'm looking at that.

451
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:28,303
Speaker 0: I'm not looking at the stage.

452
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:30,690
Speaker 0: It's not like subtitles on an anime where I can see both.

453
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:36,381
Speaker 0: Well, you're usually not missing too much I know I know but they had really fancy costumes and I only barely remember them.

454
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think my favorite is still Don Giovanni.

455
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:41,793
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

456
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:45,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever I like opera you should like opera too.

457
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:46,154
Speaker 0: We're not talking about the.

458
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:48,202
Speaker 0: we talked about the browser and now we're talking about the.

459
00:32:48,263 --> 00:32:52,781
Speaker 1: yeah, I didn't realize that We could have made a joke, but we didn't we?

460
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:53,767
Speaker 0: just I just made the joke.

461
00:32:53,787 --> 00:32:54,210
Speaker 1: No, you didn't.

462
00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:55,238
Speaker 1: You didn't make the joke.

463
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:56,467
Speaker 1: You just made a reference to it.

464
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,527
Speaker 1: That's you pointed out that you at least you were a step above the person the people.

465
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:01,130
Speaker 1: we used to know a guy.

466
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,638
Speaker 0: This is a C programming joke.

467
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:11,890
Speaker 1: Just put like a little asterisk on there and you got the joke, uh But We used to know a guy who would always and sadly it's a very easy thing to pick up and start doing subconsciously.

468
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:19,289
Speaker 1: You know, sometimes someone says something and you know that you could make a joke about it or there's a joke there But you're don't come up with the joke.

469
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:27,763
Speaker 1: What do you do is he'd always whenever that situation come up say something like well, I could make a joke about that but I think I'll leave it to your imagination.

470
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:31,418
Speaker 1: or ah I could make a joke, but I'll just let it slide.

471
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:41,273
Speaker 0: and what that really means is I'm good at recognizing opportunities for jokes, but not coming up with jokes you know very quickly and Improvisationally.

472
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:48,146
Speaker 0: therefore I will attempt to make myself Seem like I could be cool and come up with jokes by saying I could but I can't.

473
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:49,330
Speaker 1: it works pretty well.

474
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:54,792
Speaker 1: It's like getting you like you get a half point in a game when you do that as opposed to the whole point for actually Making the joke.

475
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:59,847
Speaker 1: However, if someone actually makes the joke that you couldn't come up with that's bad news.

476
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:00,669
Speaker 0: You are the lose.

477
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:05,890
Speaker 1: Anyway, my the last thing I want to say is that they kept cutting to the audience and showing everyone.

478
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,369
Speaker 1: You know acting like this is really cool and like getting really into it.

479
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:22,434
Speaker 1: But looking at their faces and this might just be me being very cynical, but I get the impression I would wager that several of the people who are like nodding along like oh, this is good Oh, yes.

480
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:22,655
Speaker 1: Yes.

481
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:30,870
Speaker 1: Yes and looking at each other and looking around and smile like yes we're.

482
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:54,453
Speaker 1: Or acting like they liked it or acting like this was a big deal in order to appear more educated or erudite or cultured to the people around them much like how Psychologists have recently discovered that the dynamics of laughter and humans have a lot to do With how you feel about your social standing compared to the people around you much more so than with the actual humor involved in the jokes Being told.

483
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:55,456
Speaker 1: Yep.

484
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:56,542
Speaker 1: That is my guess.

485
00:34:56,723 --> 00:35:06,445
Speaker 0: also, you know how the people it's like You present them with the highfalutin waters that are actually all just hose water and they're like, oh, yes I can taste the salt and the minerals in this one.

486
00:35:06,485 --> 00:35:06,866
Speaker 0: Yes.

487
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:09,494
Speaker 0: Oh It's quite that.

488
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:22,275
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that even if it even if there might be some people in the audience I have a feeling that that Psychological phenomena is quite prevalent among the persons Listening to this man saying

489
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:26,350
Speaker 1: yeah, it's like the reverse smile and nod or the group smile and nod or whatever.

490
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,193
Speaker 1: What do you got for me?

491
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:31,127
Speaker 0: So I'm going through and I see something.

492
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:31,649
Speaker 0: that's you.

493
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:36,319
Speaker 0: normally I'm not a big fan of the animals But this is a case of animals fighting which is.

494
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:39,990
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter what it could be anything fighting and fighting is always good.

495
00:35:40,131 --> 00:35:41,801
Speaker 0: I'm kind of tired of the human fighting.

496
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,390
Speaker 1: you're saying you're not a fan of the animals.

497
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:47,624
Speaker 1: You're the one who posted that big long thread about funny cute animal.

498
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:49,510
Speaker 0: We're not gonna reveal why that was done.

499
00:35:49,871 --> 00:35:51,759
Speaker 1: Oh, so you had some sort of ulterior motive.

500
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,703
Speaker 0: Perhaps we did.

501
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:58,183
Speaker 0: I also had an ulterior motive Ulterior motive in what I didn't posting another thread.

502
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:02,159
Speaker 0: I didn't even post in that thread I know but you you will see why.

503
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,806
Speaker 0: the the the.

504
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:10,167
Speaker 0: in the future I'll discuss the ulterior motive of that thread and another thread which rim started quite quite quite.

505
00:36:10,207 --> 00:36:10,448
Speaker 1: Yes.

506
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:15,369
Speaker 0: Yes Anyway, anyway in this video it starts off with some people.

507
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:19,608
Speaker 0: They're probably in Africa and like the Savannah or the Serengeti or whatever you want to call it.

508
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:30,693
Speaker 0: I don't know I'm not a wildlife discovery channel person and See some Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo and There's a lot.

509
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:31,356
Speaker 0: there's quite a few.

510
00:36:31,396 --> 00:36:38,379
Speaker 1: Buffalo perhaps a herd of them and there's not the word I mean, I mean, it's like a big herd of buff like it's a murder of crows.

511
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,010
Speaker 0: heard a gaggle of geese and One of them is really big like a huge Buffalo and it's walking and it's walking.

512
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:47,942
Speaker 0: And then they look over to the right with their video camera.

513
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:49,449
Speaker 0: And what do they see?

514
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,241
Speaker 0: Lions and you go, oh man, this is gonna be good.

515
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:57,550
Speaker 0: We're gonna see lions eat buffaloes All right, or possibly buffaloes fight off lions.

516
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,134
Speaker 0: Yeah This Buffalo is pretty big.

517
00:36:59,174 --> 00:37:09,710
Speaker 0: like if it was brave enough to like rush the lion and ram it with the horns It could have done some serious damage like probably just gored the whole damn line, but there are quite a few lines.

518
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:11,638
Speaker 0: So not the greatest move.

519
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,610
Speaker 0: they would have to like work as a team to get rid of the line plus the Buffalo.

520
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:16,096
Speaker 1: They were obviously unawares.

521
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:22,526
Speaker 0: They were much like me walking toward the bomb site and dust - I mean The Lions are pretty much the same color as the grass.

522
00:37:22,768 --> 00:37:26,348
Speaker 0: like, you know They were the light brown and it was all this light brown grass everywhere, huh?

523
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:30,270
Speaker 0: It's almost like there was some pretty sure buffaloes done at the greatest eyesight.

524
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:36,940
Speaker 1: It's almost like there's some sort of evolutionary advantage and being the same colors or surroundings if you're a predator, huh, huh?

525
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:51,388
Speaker 0: So there's some few lions crouching down and the buffaloes come closer And eventually the Lions go run run run run run run run run run run run and the Buffalo goes doo doo doo doo And the buffaloes turn around and run away.

526
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:56,330
Speaker 0: Enemy spotted yep, and I think these lines are gonna go and jump on this Buffalo, right?

527
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,872
Speaker 0: But they don't.

528
00:37:56,913 --> 00:37:59,265
Speaker 0: they pass by it and like why are you passing that Buffalo?

529
00:37:59,285 --> 00:38:00,110
Speaker 0: Where are you going to bite him?

530
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:09,670
Speaker 0: They pass by another Buffalo and then they jump on the baby Buffalo Lava girl cuz I mean while it was a baby Buffalo and that's kind of cheap.

531
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:13,590
Speaker 0: It's like picking off like the worst player on the other Counter-Strike team just to get a kill.

532
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,560
Speaker 0: But that but it had plenty of meat on it.

533
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:29,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, baby Buffalo is no shame Leaving your team to die Defending the bombsight while you sneak around back through the sewer to knife slowly to death the one afk guy.

534
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:38,030
Speaker 0: So they get this tiny Buffalo and it's like a little pond or a lake or something there and they kind of get it.

535
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:55,930
Speaker 0: But it you know and all the other big Buffalo kind of back off and they're they're going away a little bit not too far away But they're going away and all these Lions are jumping on this baby Buffalo They sort of fight with it and wrestle it like onto the edge of this water and they kind of into the edge of the Water a little bit and they're fighting with it and they're fighting with it and they're biting it.

536
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,862
Speaker 0: it looks like they've you know, pretty much killed it.

537
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:03,300
Speaker 0: as far as I could tell and You know, there's people in the who are taking the video or commenting.

538
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:09,151
Speaker 0: They're on some kind of Safari and after a few minutes It's a hubbub Crocodile.

539
00:39:09,192 --> 00:39:10,337
Speaker 1: come oh shit.

540
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:11,662
Speaker 1: You sure it's not an alligator.

541
00:39:11,823 --> 00:39:12,406
Speaker 0: It was a crowd.

542
00:39:12,426 --> 00:39:16,341
Speaker 0: They said crocodile And it lives in the water, you know, okay, you know the difference.

543
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:18,710
Speaker 0: one lives in the water one scuttles on the land.

544
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:22,470
Speaker 1: Well the easy way to tell crocodiles have the pointy nose and alligators have the wide noses.

545
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:23,433
Speaker 0: I couldn't really tell.

546
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,216
Speaker 0: it's kind of far away.

547
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:30,970
Speaker 0: and they go snap snap snap snap snap try to steal the Buffalo And the Lions are like.

548
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:40,029
Speaker 0: So eventually the Lions do manage to pull the Buffalo out of the water and more onto the land and the alligators are.

549
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:42,021
Speaker 0: the Crocodiles are like, yeah, whatever.

550
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:43,349
Speaker 0: I'm not getting out of the water's too hot.

551
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:47,027
Speaker 0: And then the big buffaloes come back.

552
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:52,382
Speaker 0: Oh shit They're probably mad now and I won't give away the ending but it's it's quite hilarious.

553
00:39:52,944 --> 00:39:53,646
Speaker 1: You know what it is.

554
00:39:54,187 --> 00:39:56,370
Speaker 1: It's the circle of life lol.

555
00:39:58,152 --> 00:40:05,020
Speaker 0: All right, so by recent request and by Going along with the news item.

556
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:06,669
Speaker 0: We got to talk about the raid.

557
00:40:07,191 --> 00:40:07,512
Speaker 1: Alright.

558
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:11,444
Speaker 1: now very briefly raid RAID.

559
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:25,960
Speaker 1: now there is some debate as to what raid actually stands for but I'm going to pretty much go out into the open and say that if you think it stands for anything other than redundant array of Independent discs then you're pretty much an idiot.

560
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really expensive discs.

561
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:32,600
Speaker 0: Okay Yes, so I could get floppy disks.

562
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,442
Speaker 0: Does that count?

563
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:35,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna make a raid with floppies.

564
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:38,334
Speaker 1: They're real Alright.

565
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:45,787
Speaker 1: so before we talk about what raid is What I mean raid solves a problem that a lot of people don't realize they have.

566
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:50,250
Speaker 0: you see well It solves a problem that also was a great bigger problem in the olden days.

567
00:40:50,410 --> 00:41:09,718
Speaker 1: Yes, you see in terms of your computer into the most unreliable as per how unit valuable it is in a computer is Always the hard drive because that is where the data is and the data is often not as Replaceable as the components of the computer itself.

568
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:14,614
Speaker 0: I mean even if RAM let's say RAM was super unreliable RAM broke all the time Right.

569
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:18,038
Speaker 0: Well if RAM breaks That's not really that big a deal.

570
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:21,250
Speaker 0: if you have money because you replace the RAM you didn't lose anything.

571
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:25,390
Speaker 1: Yes, money can always solve normal computer problems, right?

572
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,390
Speaker 0: But your hard drive has some data on it, which cannot be replaced if it is lost.

573
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:32,261
Speaker 0: So that's why you do backups and all these sorts of things.

574
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:38,031
Speaker 0: also hard drives have moving parts Which makes them extremely prone to failure Extremely.

575
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:49,267
Speaker 1: Yes hard drives crash fairly often and I've actually got two Completely full completely crashed hard drives sitting around my room that I wish I could get the data off of.

576
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:50,290
Speaker 1: but there's just no way.

577
00:41:51,015 --> 00:41:52,404
Speaker 1: Even if I had a lot of money, there's a good chance.

578
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:53,089
Speaker 1: I just couldn't do it.

579
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,475
Speaker 0: So raid is one.

580
00:41:54,736 --> 00:42:03,908
Speaker 0: one thing raid does is technology which solves the problem that Hard drives are prone to failure and you don't want that to fuck you and you don't want to lose data.

581
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,495
Speaker 1: now There's another problem.

582
00:42:05,535 --> 00:42:09,250
Speaker 1: There is another problem hard drives because like Scott said they have moving parts.

583
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:13,524
Speaker 1: You know, there's a physical thing moving around in there getting the data.

584
00:42:14,066 --> 00:42:16,737
Speaker 1: hard drives are Incredibly slow.

585
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:19,630
Speaker 1: They're the slowest part of your computer by far.

586
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:31,210
Speaker 0: This is why we have RAM and why we have cash and why we have all these other place registers and other places for to store data in your computer because Sometimes you need to access read and write data really quickly.

587
00:42:31,692 --> 00:42:33,220
Speaker 0: So that's why we have RAM and things.

588
00:42:33,522 --> 00:42:37,302
Speaker 0: if hard drives are as fast as RAM We just wouldn't have hard drives.

589
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:39,652
Speaker 0: We would have just so much RAM You wouldn't believe.

590
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:43,764
Speaker 0: but when you want to store all it's hard to have a lot of data.

591
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:45,790
Speaker 0: That is also rapidly accessible.

592
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:51,542
Speaker 0: That's why we have these different levels, you know, a register is stupidly fast but it's also stupidly small.

593
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,832
Speaker 0: a RAM is Bigger.

594
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:59,230
Speaker 0: you can have like two gigs of RAM many gigs of RAM and it's fast not as fast as registers.

595
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,221
Speaker 1: Well, more importantly it's not persistent.

596
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:16,436
Speaker 0: Yep hard drives Not only can you have a whole shit ton of data stored permanently even after the computer turns off but you can have a whole shit ton of data stored permanently when the computer turns off and It's kind of slow.

597
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:17,260
Speaker 1: It sucks.

598
00:43:17,823 --> 00:43:22,319
Speaker 1: So raid Solves both of these problems in various different ways.

599
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,590
Speaker 1: You see they realize problem - oh you have a third problem.

600
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,554
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a third problem right?

601
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:32,704
Speaker 0: So sometimes, you know, imagine if you did, okay Let's say you just wanted to have a whole bunch of hard drives, right?

602
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:36,960
Speaker 0: Let's say you wanted to have I don't know three terabytes of data, right?

603
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:38,144
Speaker 0: So you went there's.

604
00:43:38,184 --> 00:43:40,090
Speaker 0: no it's very hard to get terabyte drives.

605
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,990
Speaker 0: Let's say you in the olden days was even harder to care terabyte drives.

606
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:48,810
Speaker 0: You would need 31 gigabyte hard drives or as some people say gigabyte hard drive.

607
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, those people however.

608
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:50,475
Speaker 1: Yeah.

609
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:55,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, but let's say today you go out you buy three one terabyte hard drives, right?

610
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,990
Speaker 0: Now, let's say you have a database and that database is two and a half terabytes large.

611
00:43:59,835 --> 00:44:01,613
Speaker 0: You need to now Have.

612
00:44:01,994 --> 00:44:03,500
Speaker 0: you're like you'll see using Windows.

613
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,930
Speaker 0: You've got the C Drive the D Drive in the eDrive.

614
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:08,938
Speaker 0: How do you get one file on three drives?

615
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:11,605
Speaker 0: a 30 terabyte hard drive does not exist.

616
00:44:11,946 --> 00:44:13,210
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do about that?

617
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:20,156
Speaker 1: Yes, so think about the name raid redundant array of Independent disks.

618
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:23,168
Speaker 1: It's pretty self-explanatory as to what it is.

619
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:25,930
Speaker 1: Basically One hard drive is unreliable.

620
00:44:26,491 --> 00:44:31,283
Speaker 1: However, the odds of that hard drive failing are X. say you have two hard drives.

621
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:36,096
Speaker 1: the odds of both of them failing at the same Time are much less.

622
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:43,061
Speaker 0: unless you buy two of the exact same hard drive on the exact same day from the exact same And even then use them the exact same amount.

623
00:44:43,342 --> 00:44:44,869
Speaker 1: even then it's still somewhat less.

624
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:46,332
Speaker 1: Yep But not as much less.

625
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:47,315
Speaker 1: but still now.

626
00:44:47,415 --> 00:44:48,598
Speaker 1: three drives four drives.

627
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:57,890
Speaker 1: if you only needed one drive to stay up and your data would Be okay, then for every drive you add your data is that much safer and that much more secure.

628
00:44:58,182 --> 00:45:09,981
Speaker 0: Yeah If I have a hundred gigs of data And I have three 100 gigabyte hard drives and I have the exact same data on all three drives at all times and one of them crashes Big deal.

629
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:11,779
Speaker 1: now to Speed.

630
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:26,050
Speaker 1: All right I've got a hundred megabytes worth of data on a hundred megabyte hard drive and when I'm gonna read that data I basically because it's a physically moving part in there I have to read it from beginning to end if I'm reading it at one big piece of data in one go.

631
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:28,806
Speaker 1: So I'm limited by the speed of the hard drives.

632
00:45:28,846 --> 00:45:35,770
Speaker 0: data access Yes The slowest part of the hard drive is the moving discs inside and the read head that goes back and forth on them.

633
00:45:36,392 --> 00:45:41,370
Speaker 0: Actually that when once the data is read off of the platter the rest is stupidly fast.

634
00:45:41,892 --> 00:45:45,230
Speaker 0: So anytime you can make those things go faster is better.

635
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:50,310
Speaker 0: Your computer can handle all the hard drives are sending out because it's just so much faster than the hard drive is.

636
00:45:50,912 --> 00:45:53,941
Speaker 1: So now let's say I've got two 100 megabyte drives.

637
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,510
Speaker 1: Both of them have the exact same data on them.

638
00:45:57,353 --> 00:46:07,590
Speaker 1: I could have one hard drive start reading from the beginning of the file forward and Simultaneously start reading the data from the middle of the hard drive to the end on the other drive.

639
00:46:07,911 --> 00:46:11,869
Speaker 1: So now I can get the data off the hard drive pretty much twice as fast.

640
00:46:12,552 --> 00:46:14,498
Speaker 0: That's pretty high quality right now.

641
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:15,361
Speaker 1: say I have three.

642
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:18,290
Speaker 1: now I can read in third save for every drive.

643
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:27,930
Speaker 1: I add it gets that much faster to read data off because I can read the data in parallel Obviously diminishing returns if you're randomly reading data from all over the hard drive.

644
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:31,910
Speaker 1: But it's still a significant performance increase and that's why rate is awesome.

645
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, problem three.

646
00:46:33,396 --> 00:46:36,450
Speaker 1: I want to have I say I got ten one gigabyte drives.

647
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:38,919
Speaker 1: I want to combine them all to make one ten gigabyte drive.

648
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,445
Speaker 1: Well ray just does that.

649
00:46:40,645 --> 00:46:41,288
Speaker 0: it just does that.

650
00:46:41,308 --> 00:46:43,610
Speaker 1: not gonna make an Analogy, I think you can figure it out at this point.

651
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:50,910
Speaker 0: You take rats up pretty much to sum up raid the simplest way possible to someone who doesn't want to know any of the details.

652
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:56,326
Speaker 0: You take a bunch of drives a bunch of hard drives and you combine them into one hard drive.

653
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:57,630
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

654
00:46:58,272 --> 00:47:04,170
Speaker 1: So you might have heard then that there's all these different kinds of raid raid zero number one raid zero plus one.

655
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:07,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, you might have five Jbod raid ten.

656
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:08,719
Speaker 1: raid six is my favorite.

657
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:09,020
Speaker 1: Yep.

658
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:11,346
Speaker 0: Well the first one let's talk about that one first.

659
00:47:11,386 --> 00:47:15,380
Speaker 1: Jbod Jbod Jbod just a bunch of discs.

660
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:23,310
Speaker 1: That's a Jbod is it's all it lets you Do is take a bunch of drives and either plug them all in or mash them all together into one big drive.

661
00:47:23,612 --> 00:47:24,963
Speaker 1: So it's not really a raid.

662
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:25,750
Speaker 1: It's an aid.

663
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,977
Speaker 1: It's just an array of independent disks.

664
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:29,100
Speaker 1: There's no redundancy.

665
00:47:29,461 --> 00:47:32,410
Speaker 1: if one drive goes you lose everything.

666
00:47:33,095 --> 00:47:34,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it's just one big hard drive.

667
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:44,569
Speaker 0: If it's part of your hard drive crashes Well now it can't figure out what data is on any part of the drive because the way file systems work That's using that fancy new ZFS thing.

668
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:45,633
Speaker 1: But even that might save.

669
00:47:45,674 --> 00:47:50,370
Speaker 1: like theoretically if part of a hard drive died you could get the data from the rest of it.

670
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:54,190
Speaker 1: But that data would be mostly useless due to fragmentation and other issues.

671
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,590
Speaker 1: You'd be lucky to get anything and to be very expensive and difficult.

672
00:47:56,811 --> 00:47:57,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not.

673
00:47:57,494 --> 00:48:03,420
Speaker 0: basically if you have just a bunch of discs and a one drive crashes You're done also with just a bunch of discs.

674
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,690
Speaker 0: You're not speeding anything up at all.

675
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,410
Speaker 0: It's it's going just as fast as it would be if you had one disc.

676
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:13,363
Speaker 1: You basically get almost none of the benefits and all of the problems.

677
00:48:13,744 --> 00:48:14,386
Speaker 1: because think of this.

678
00:48:14,627 --> 00:48:15,590
Speaker 1: Here's the biggest problem.

679
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:17,860
Speaker 1: All right, J Bob say I combine one.

680
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,467
Speaker 1: I combine two discs into one.

681
00:48:20,049 --> 00:48:26,757
Speaker 1: now I've doubled the chances of losing all the data because if either one of those drives fails at any point I lose all the data.

682
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:28,566
Speaker 1: say I've got ten discs.

683
00:48:29,069 --> 00:48:31,158
Speaker 1: now There are ten hard drives.

684
00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:37,240
Speaker 0: if any one of them fails, I'm fucked Alright, so the next one you got is raid zero.

685
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:40,109
Speaker 0: raid zero does something called striping.

686
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:45,210
Speaker 1: raid Zero is the way to get speed and performance and you sacrifice for liability.

687
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:49,670
Speaker 0: Yes, basically raid zero is also not gonna save you if any of the drives crashes.

688
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:54,549
Speaker 0: You still have the same problems of oh my god one drive crash.

689
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:55,389
Speaker 0: now It's all gone.

690
00:48:55,972 --> 00:49:02,204
Speaker 0: You solve the problem of turning a bunch of drives into one drive and you solve the problem of hey Let's make this go faster what it does.

691
00:49:02,224 --> 00:49:05,819
Speaker 0: instead of writing Let's say you have a hundred megabyte file, right.

692
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:13,750
Speaker 0: instead of writing a hundred megabytes onto drive number one It'll write 50 megabytes into drive number one and 50 megabytes into drive number two.

693
00:49:14,253 --> 00:49:19,669
Speaker 0: And that way when you want to read the debt that file It will read it off of both drives at the same time.

694
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:35,390
Speaker 0: It's sort of like slicing through a cake if you imagine both drives being on top of each other and the data is written by right directly on top and then through into the next drive and You basically can get almost twice as much data on and off your drives.

695
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:37,139
Speaker 0: Yes, you could with just one drive.

696
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:43,890
Speaker 1: in practice due to the way it works It ends up being somewhat less than that, but it's still a fairly significant and measurable performance increase.

697
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:48,970
Speaker 0: If you're having it keep in mind that's not gonna be a performance increase for most normal people.

698
00:49:49,332 --> 00:49:58,183
Speaker 0: It's only gonna help you if you're reading and writing a lot of data Like I don't know loading a gigabyte of textures from a drive So you're loading times and fancy games will increase.

699
00:49:58,284 --> 00:50:04,470
Speaker 0: or say Encoding HD videos that take up ginormous amounts of space something like that.

700
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:09,869
Speaker 1: a lot of people will put like their scratch space or their temp files on a rust right trade like that.

701
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:19,977
Speaker 1: or They'll install their operating system there on a stripe like that and then they put all their actual data files and config files Somewhere else where it's secure and backed up.

702
00:50:20,238 --> 00:50:20,398
Speaker 0: Yep.

703
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:22,666
Speaker 1: Now again, this is not really a raid.

704
00:50:23,127 --> 00:50:23,990
Speaker 1: It's an a raid.

705
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,274
Speaker 1: There's no redundancy.

706
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:26,940
Speaker 0: It's not but it is called raids.

707
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,448
Speaker 1: Yes, it is called raid, but technically there's no redundancy.

708
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:35,670
Speaker 0: that is No data, I guess I guess the name of it is actually quite good because it's raid zero raid nothing.

709
00:50:36,649 --> 00:50:40,945
Speaker 1: Ah Yeah, now raid one is the exact opposite of that.

710
00:50:41,026 --> 00:50:47,490
Speaker 1: instead of striping It's mirroring all it does say I've got two identical drives two drives of the same size.

711
00:50:48,034 --> 00:50:49,629
Speaker 1: It writes the exact same data to both.

712
00:50:50,011 --> 00:50:50,372
Speaker 0: That's it.

713
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:50,753
Speaker 0: now

714
00:50:51,174 --> 00:51:08,170
Speaker 1: you often will take depending on how it's set up a slight performance hit because you have to write data to both Drives and keep them in sync, but you get a substantial performance increase on reading because you can still read the data Independently from the two different drives as long as the setup properly.

715
00:51:08,673 --> 00:51:09,781
Speaker 0: Yeah, and this is really good.

716
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:18,590
Speaker 0: because now, you know If you have important data you want to save and you don't really care about reading or writing it very quickly and it's you Know you can fit it on one drive.

717
00:51:18,972 --> 00:51:24,237
Speaker 0: You just buy one more drive and now you don't have to keep tape backups You need to run backup applications.

718
00:51:24,257 --> 00:51:29,769
Speaker 0: You do need to take you do if you're in a serious environment But for your home a raid one is enough.

719
00:51:30,091 --> 00:51:34,985
Speaker 1: Well, I guess we we're not gonna get into this but there are two very different kinds of backing up data.

720
00:51:35,527 --> 00:51:36,590
Speaker 1: raid is one of them.

721
00:51:36,932 --> 00:51:53,450
Speaker 1: there's another kind of backup and a lot of people are under the Misassumption that if you have a raid one or some sort of raid that protects your data from being lost in a physical hard drive failure That that is all the backing up you need to do because there are a lot of things that does not protect you.

722
00:51:53,651 --> 00:51:58,750
Speaker 0: You know if you're in a business environment and you want to make sure you have the best practices then the raid is not enough.

723
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:04,590
Speaker 0: But if you're a guy at home and you want to make sure your mp3 collection is around forever a raid one will do it.

724
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:08,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, just don't accidentally type RM - RF star and you're fine.

725
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:13,687
Speaker 0: Yes, and if one of the drives crashes replace it so that you know, you can keep your mirror.

726
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:17,314
Speaker 1: But anyway raid one I mean obviously the benefits.

727
00:52:17,896 --> 00:52:21,186
Speaker 1: you have your failure chances because you have two drives in this.

728
00:52:21,707 --> 00:52:23,994
Speaker 1: if one of them fails You're just fine.

729
00:52:24,295 --> 00:52:26,463
Speaker 1: You just replace it and it'll rebuild itself.

730
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:28,570
Speaker 1: You don't lose any data at all.

731
00:52:29,132 --> 00:52:38,314
Speaker 1: the only way you can lose your data short of a problem with you know, Deleting your data on your own a user error is if both drives fail Simultaneously.

732
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:39,869
Speaker 1: the odds of that are pretty low.

733
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:46,670
Speaker 0: Yeah Now the thing to know about raid zero and one is that they require at least two drives each.

734
00:52:47,174 --> 00:52:49,130
Speaker 0: You know, you could do a raid zero with two drives.

735
00:52:49,312 --> 00:52:51,956
Speaker 0: You could do with more than two drives also But you need at least two.

736
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:54,470
Speaker 0: raid one also needs at least two drives.

737
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:59,930
Speaker 0: The thing with raid one also is that let's say you have a 500 gigabyte drive and a 200 gigabyte drive.

738
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:05,888
Speaker 0: Well, you're only gonna have 200 gigabytes of space total because it's gonna have 200 gigs and that it's gonna mirror it.

739
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:06,797
Speaker 0: and that's you're Done.

740
00:53:07,003 --> 00:53:07,209
Speaker 1: Yep.

741
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:15,710
Speaker 1: So the benefits of raid zero super fast super easy big performance increase and there's effectively zero overhead.

742
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:16,994
Speaker 1: You don't have any space.

743
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:20,694
Speaker 0: Yep, but you are going to Double your chances.

744
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:24,046
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah you Significantly increases your chance of losing data.

745
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:29,058
Speaker 1: raid one has your chances of failure and you still get a performance increase from reading.

746
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:35,968
Speaker 1: you take usually a performance hit of some kind in writing but The overhead is 50%.

747
00:53:35,968 --> 00:53:39,460
Speaker 1: you lose fully half of the hard drive capacity you have.

748
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:46,493
Speaker 0: Yep, to 500 gig drives only gives you 500 gigs of space Whereas with a raid zero that gives you a terabyte of space.

749
00:53:46,754 --> 00:53:47,880
Speaker 1: so you might think alright.

750
00:53:48,242 --> 00:53:50,453
Speaker 1: Well, uh, there is there a more efficient way to do this.

751
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:51,760
Speaker 1: Well, I ought to be some sort of math.

752
00:53:51,941 --> 00:53:53,367
Speaker 1: I could do this one.

753
00:53:53,387 --> 00:53:54,533
Speaker 0: There's one other thing you can do.

754
00:53:54,573 --> 00:53:56,040
Speaker 0: You could do a raid zero plus one.

755
00:53:57,003 --> 00:54:01,600
Speaker 1: Ah the raid zero plus one the realm of people with infinite money.

756
00:54:01,841 --> 00:54:03,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, see a raid zero plus one.

757
00:54:03,527 --> 00:54:07,120
Speaker 0: the way this works is you have two raid zeros, right?

758
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,280
Speaker 0: So I got drive one and two drive one and two are striped in a raid zero.

759
00:54:11,843 --> 00:54:18,512
Speaker 0: Drives three and four are striped in a raid zero But drives three and four are a mirror of the stripe.

760
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:20,017
Speaker 0: that is raid zero and one.

761
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:23,230
Speaker 0: you basically Mirror two raid zeros.

762
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:25,380
Speaker 1: It's a little more complicated than that.

763
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:28,052
Speaker 1: But all of these kinds of raids are a little more complicated than that.

764
00:54:28,093 --> 00:54:30,142
Speaker 1: Yes, you don't care good god You don't care.

765
00:54:30,182 --> 00:54:36,100
Speaker 1: Yes, so nice to say you get crazy performance benefits and the only thing it costs you is money.

766
00:54:36,521 --> 00:54:47,599
Speaker 0: yeah, raid zero plus one obviously requires at least four drives and Use the size of the smallest drive and it's expensive and it needs a lot of overhead.

767
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:52,800
Speaker 0: and But you basically get a striped raid zero, which is stupidly fast.

768
00:54:53,162 --> 00:55:07,994
Speaker 0: so you get all the speed benefits of raid zero and If one of the two if one of the stripes goes down you can replace it with another stripe and you're still good With the the raid oneness, it's not widely reused not terribly well supported.

769
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:12,727
Speaker 1: You probably want to avoid it because Raid five exists.

770
00:55:12,928 --> 00:55:13,209
Speaker 1: Yes.

771
00:55:13,469 --> 00:55:15,095
Speaker 1: We'll talk about raid three and five.

772
00:55:15,196 --> 00:55:16,320
Speaker 0: you want to talk about three first?

773
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:17,031
Speaker 0: Well be able.

774
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:22,320
Speaker 0: first I think we should just talk about why we don't talk about two three and four and why no one uses two three and four.

775
00:55:22,571 --> 00:55:43,739
Speaker 1: well the Raid standards each level of raid is a specific way of going about this and they all have their pros and cons and for various reasons They have all become effectively obsolete except for raid Zero one five six and then a lot of the proprietary or special corporate ones that we don't need to talk about.

776
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:48,263
Speaker 1: Yep, raid four and raid five are the same Effectively.

777
00:55:48,665 --> 00:55:51,157
Speaker 1: It's just a matter of how they go about what they do.

778
00:55:52,004 --> 00:55:54,727
Speaker 1: raid three is Similar to four and five.

779
00:55:55,069 --> 00:56:00,129
Speaker 1: it just goes about it again in a different way But it's not as similar as far as to five.

780
00:56:00,651 --> 00:56:01,855
Speaker 1: Yep raid two.

781
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:02,978
Speaker 1: Don't even worry about it.

782
00:56:02,998 --> 00:56:05,095
Speaker 0: Good God Don't don't worry about raid two.

783
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:14,180
Speaker 0: in fact I wouldn't even recommend reading the Wikipedia is or anything on the other is actually a website if you just search that has pictures And diagrams that show you how all the raids work specifically.

784
00:56:14,321 --> 00:56:16,439
Speaker 1: It's kind of interesting if you're into that sort of thing.

785
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:21,760
Speaker 0: Yes, but basically what all these things come down to is something called parity.

786
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:24,867
Speaker 0: It's a magical math that I'm going to teach you.

787
00:56:25,268 --> 00:56:41,839
Speaker 0: that allows you to have say I don't know five hard drives and Be able to actually use four of them but without mirroring and You can still have all the benefits of raid zero and one at the same time by using magic math.

788
00:56:41,919 --> 00:56:44,573
Speaker 1: now Parity is not just used in raid and harder.

789
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:45,980
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's used all over the place.

790
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,607
Speaker 1: Parity is used in a lot of things.

791
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:50,840
Speaker 1: It's basically a way of knowing well, there's different ways to use it.

792
00:56:50,860 --> 00:57:05,868
Speaker 1: it's a way of knowing if data has been corrupted or changed in transit or in storage and Depending on how it's set up knowing how to fix that data by adding metadata the meta the sum of the metadata Being less than the sum of the actual data.

793
00:57:05,888 --> 00:57:09,700
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm because I mean theoretically you could always just send your data twice.

794
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:14,960
Speaker 0: Yep, so I'm not gonna actually talk about the actual math used because it's kind of complicated.

795
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:17,934
Speaker 0: I love I'm going to use the simplified version of it.

796
00:57:17,994 --> 00:57:19,320
Speaker 0: That is easier to understand.

797
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:25,920
Speaker 1: What I will do is I'll link to a very simple and easy to understand method that is used in some old networking equipment.

798
00:57:26,061 --> 00:57:27,165
Speaker 1: Yep, I'll link to it.

799
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:29,073
Speaker 1: There's a nice animated tutorial somewhere out there.

800
00:57:29,093 --> 00:57:30,600
Speaker 0: I'm sure but here's an example, right?

801
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,759
Speaker 0: Let's say I have four bits.

802
00:57:33,021 --> 00:57:37,597
Speaker 0: So four zeros and ones right and I want to remember all four of them.

803
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:42,559
Speaker 0: now I all I need here first is I need one more zero and one.

804
00:57:42,881 --> 00:57:48,710
Speaker 0: Alright, if I only have four zeros and ones and one of them breaks There's no way for me to figure out what that missing one is.

805
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:51,220
Speaker 0: it broke and I only have three of the zeros and ones.

806
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,111
Speaker 0: Let's say it's one one zero zero just for example, right?

807
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:56,039
Speaker 0: Let's say the second one dies.

808
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,728
Speaker 0: now I have one blank zero zero.

809
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:02,160
Speaker 0: How the hell do I know what if that broken one is a one or a zero?

810
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,379
Speaker 0: I have a 50% chance of guessing that sucks.

811
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:09,076
Speaker 0: I'm basically gonna be screwed if I pick wrong and that that imagine.

812
00:58:09,096 --> 00:58:10,320
Speaker 0: now you're dealing with a hard drive.

813
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,706
Speaker 0: That's millions and millions and billions of ones and zeros.

814
00:58:13,128 --> 00:58:14,050
Speaker 0: It's not gonna work out.

815
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:14,672
Speaker 0: Right?

816
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:17,700
Speaker 0: So first I need an additional one or zero.

817
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:20,607
Speaker 0: so Normally with a mirror, right?

818
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:23,800
Speaker 0: I would need to remember all four of these ones and zeros.

819
00:58:23,941 --> 00:58:27,540
Speaker 0: I would need four more ones and zeros to mirror four drives.

820
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,804
Speaker 0: I need four drives.

821
00:58:29,245 --> 00:58:32,253
Speaker 0: that kind of sucks with this magic parody math.

822
00:58:32,373 --> 00:58:34,700
Speaker 0: I can do it with just one more drive.

823
00:58:35,162 --> 00:58:43,600
Speaker 0: So four drives add just one more drive And now I can remember it just as well as if I had four more drives.

824
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:44,848
Speaker 0: That's pretty hot.

825
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:49,820
Speaker 1: now to get back to raid We'll use the example of raid three because that makes it's the easiest to understand.

826
00:58:50,522 --> 00:58:51,886
Speaker 1: Let's say we'll do we you.

827
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:57,744
Speaker 1: it doesn't really give by you anything with two drives because you need one drive to be the parody Drive, so it doesn't matter.

828
00:58:58,025 --> 00:59:01,340
Speaker 1: So we'll start with three drives and we'll compare this to mirror.

829
00:59:01,864 --> 00:59:04,119
Speaker 1: So I want to make a raid three with three drives.

830
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:10,759
Speaker 1: Basically drive one and drive two contain data and I spread data across these two.

831
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,907
Speaker 1: But drive three doesn't contain any data at all.

832
00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:19,020
Speaker 1: drive three contains parody information of the data on the other two drives.

833
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:23,454
Speaker 0: Yep, that's the extra bit that you need as opposed to copying everything.

834
00:59:23,494 --> 00:59:25,160
Speaker 0: You just have the extra bit on the end.

835
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:39,337
Speaker 1: so if drive one fails Between the information on drive to the data there and the parody information on drive three I can recreate the data that should have been on drive one when drive one got destroyed.

836
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:40,320
Speaker 0: and this is how it's done.

837
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:40,701
Speaker 0: You ready?

838
00:59:41,162 --> 00:59:45,656
Speaker 0: Let's say drive zero is has a one on it and drive two has a one on it.

839
00:59:45,796 --> 00:59:47,060
Speaker 0: right drive three.

840
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:48,445
Speaker 0: What do we put there?

841
00:59:48,726 --> 00:59:51,395
Speaker 0: Well, let's say let's pick even right.

842
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:54,666
Speaker 0: Well, there's two ones That's an even number of ones.

843
00:59:55,107 --> 00:59:57,134
Speaker 0: So on drive three we put a zero.

844
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:58,980
Speaker 0: now, let's say drive one dies.

845
00:59:59,502 --> 01:00:02,720
Speaker 0: Well, we know that the drive three says zero.

846
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,485
Speaker 0: So there should be an even number of ones.

847
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:08,357
Speaker 0: and we know that on drive two, which still works.

848
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,060
Speaker 0: There's a one.

849
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:14,580
Speaker 0: Therefore drive one must be one dun-dun-dun.

850
01:00:16,202 --> 01:00:21,120
Speaker 1: Luckily for the world Ray does not work on the bit level like that.

851
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:22,383
Speaker 1: No I doesn't precise.

852
01:00:22,624 --> 01:00:28,180
Speaker 1: and in fact the only difference between raid four and raid five is how it goes about that specific.

853
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:33,139
Speaker 0: Yes, they don't use that exact math because that exact math would take for god damn ever.

854
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:33,400
Speaker 0: They do it.

855
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,287
Speaker 0: It would be a nightmare.

856
01:00:34,307 --> 01:00:35,900
Speaker 1: They do it in much larger chunks.

857
01:00:36,101 --> 01:00:38,780
Speaker 0: Yes, they do it in huge chunks of ones and zeros.

858
01:00:38,941 --> 01:00:41,680
Speaker 0: But and they use very fancier and more efficient math.

859
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:48,915
Speaker 0: But that's basically the kind of thing that's going on here is you have You know some ones and zeros and then some other ones and zeros.

860
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:49,980
Speaker 0: that are your actual data.

861
01:00:50,462 --> 01:01:10,915
Speaker 0: and then you sort of line them up in rows and columns and Make a new line of ones and zeros and that way if any one line Column or row gets knocked out you can look at the columns and rows around it add them up and then By looking at all them and doing some math you can redraw all the missing ones and zeros.

862
01:01:10,956 --> 01:01:18,324
Speaker 0: sort of like if someone array Yeah to sudoku that was working and I erased the middle of it you would be very easy for you to just figure out the Answer in the middle.

863
01:01:18,848 --> 01:01:19,472
Speaker 0: That's what it's like.

864
01:01:19,492 --> 01:01:21,078
Speaker 1: That's a really good analogy actually Yeah.

865
01:01:21,521 --> 01:01:29,294
Speaker 1: So thus very briefly because I'm sure now you're all wondering what the differences are between raid three four and five Because you always hear about raid five, you know here about three so much.

866
01:01:29,515 --> 01:01:34,820
Speaker 1: Yep, three Alright, so I've got what I have a parody drive and two normal drives.

867
01:01:35,102 --> 01:01:38,963
Speaker 1: Basically with mirroring I lose 50%.

868
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:43,960
Speaker 1: I lose one drives worth of space to put stuff because the whole drive is taken up by that extra information.

869
01:01:44,442 --> 01:01:47,920
Speaker 1: With raid three I lose one disc total.

870
01:01:48,382 --> 01:02:07,680
Speaker 1: So I get the space of n minus one discs and being the number of discs that I've bought The problem with raid three is that while you get a performance increase from being able to Hit all these drives and read data from them parallel Whatever no matter what you do whenever you write data to the drives There's always the bottleneck of that third drive.

871
01:02:08,037 --> 01:02:12,729
Speaker 1: No If you're just reading from drive one or drive two You always have to read from drive three drive three.

872
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,777
Speaker 1: the parody drive is always in use.

873
01:02:14,837 --> 01:02:15,760
Speaker 1: It's always the bottleneck.

874
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:19,871
Speaker 1: It actually becomes much more likely to fail because it's getting hammered all the time.

875
01:02:20,212 --> 01:02:23,100
Speaker 1: Yep, and thus raid four and five.

876
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,325
Speaker 1: We'll just talk about raid five.

877
01:02:25,027 --> 01:02:31,990
Speaker 1: The only difference is that instead of having one parody drive It distributes the parody among all of the drives.

878
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:35,300
Speaker 1: So every drive contains parody and data.

879
01:02:35,902 --> 01:02:45,379
Speaker 1: Thus there's no one drive that's singled out and all the drives are treated equally and as a result you get much more of a Performance increase lesser performance hit and it's generally much safer.

880
01:02:45,439 --> 01:02:53,060
Speaker 0: Yep So instead of having let's say you got five drives Normally, you would have let's see drives one two, three and four would have the data and drive five would be the parody.

881
01:02:53,463 --> 01:02:55,820
Speaker 0: Well, what if we made each drive?

882
01:02:56,301 --> 01:03:01,540
Speaker 0: Four fifths of each drive was data and one fifth of each drive was parody.

883
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:09,565
Speaker 0: So the first fifth of drive one is parody the second fifth of the second drive was parody the third fifth of the first drive Was parody etc.

884
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:13,040
Speaker 0: and all the other fifths of each drive was the actual data.

885
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:19,600
Speaker 0: Now each drive has a little parody and a lot of data and you're only losing what one fifth of the space.

886
01:03:19,741 --> 01:03:24,365
Speaker 0: So with five 100 gig drives you have 400 gigs of space.

887
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:28,260
Speaker 0: if a drive crashes you can replace it and you won't lose any data.

888
01:03:29,002 --> 01:03:34,440
Speaker 0: More the benefits of the striping going on because you're reading from all these drives at once instead of just one drive.

889
01:03:35,141 --> 01:03:36,466
Speaker 0: It's just awesome all around.

890
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:39,840
Speaker 1: and the primary benefit is that now you can raid three.

891
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:45,160
Speaker 1: I guess I don't know afraid you could actually do it because I've never actually run into raid three in the real world.

892
01:03:45,361 --> 01:03:46,225
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not going to.

893
01:03:46,386 --> 01:03:49,400
Speaker 1: in all my I mean, it's always raid five or some proprietary thing.

894
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,560
Speaker 1: But with raid five say a drive fails.

895
01:03:53,162 --> 01:04:01,894
Speaker 1: The raid will continue to function in a degraded state where when you're reading data It'll on the fly figure out what the data should have been based on the parody.

896
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:10,040
Speaker 1: and because the parody is distributed It's not as much of a performance hit as it otherwise would be It's still a performance hit though.

897
01:04:10,401 --> 01:04:15,617
Speaker 1: So usually what you do is you end up having an n minus 2 hit to the amount of space you get.

898
01:04:15,998 --> 01:04:19,369
Speaker 1: so say you've got You want four drives you want to raid five of them.

899
01:04:19,931 --> 01:04:29,423
Speaker 1: what's generally done in the corporate world is two drives end up equivalent of being data and then the third drive equivalent is the parody and It's distributed.

900
01:04:29,463 --> 01:04:30,749
Speaker 1: but that's how it works logically.

901
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:33,440
Speaker 1: The fourth drive is not even active.

902
01:04:33,602 --> 01:04:41,220
Speaker 1: It just sits there spun up ready And if a drive fails the raid starts running in a degraded state so you can still use it.

903
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,166
Speaker 1: But there's a performance hit.

904
01:04:42,609 --> 01:04:52,274
Speaker 1: meanwhile it starts Recreating the data that should have been on the dead drive on that spare drive Because they're only really failing of raid five and raid three.

905
01:04:52,294 --> 01:04:53,940
Speaker 1: and all this is that let's say a drive dies.

906
01:04:54,168 --> 01:04:55,237
Speaker 0: All right It'll still work.

907
01:04:55,701 --> 01:05:03,960
Speaker 1: But now I'm in a dangerous position because now all the drives are being hit harder Because they have to do more work to figure out all the data on the missing drive.

908
01:05:04,149 --> 01:05:14,543
Speaker 1: Yeah So now I'm pushing them more than I would have been already - if another drive fails before I have on that old drive that broke replaced I lose everything.

909
01:05:14,624 --> 01:05:16,670
Speaker 1: it's over because I can't recover from drives.

910
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:20,845
Speaker 0: failing you get to figure out the number of even ones and zeros and Stuff like that.

911
01:05:20,905 --> 01:05:23,484
Speaker 0: You need to have pretty much all of them But one.

912
01:05:23,504 --> 01:05:27,226
Speaker 0: if you're losing just one of the you know The set you can figure it out.

913
01:05:27,306 --> 01:05:31,540
Speaker 0: if you miss two from the set you can't figure out - it doesn't work.

914
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:32,839
Speaker 0: The math doesn't work that way.

915
01:05:33,181 --> 01:05:36,398
Speaker 1: That is where all those other raids that we're not going to talk about come in.

916
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:45,250
Speaker 1: Where they'll do something like the parody is actually a grid instead of just stripes so you can lose Certain combinations of drives and still be okay.

917
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:48,060
Speaker 0: You have two different parity schemes working at the same time.

918
01:05:48,141 --> 01:05:50,543
Speaker 0: So if you lose certain data Then you can.

919
01:05:50,704 --> 01:06:04,270
Speaker 0: you might one parity scheme might work or like one parity scheme might be able to save the other Parity scheme which can then save the data and all sorts of it's like redundancy of the parity But not of the actual data and it's crazy stuff like that.

920
01:06:04,912 --> 01:06:06,657
Speaker 1: All right, we've gone on a while.

921
01:06:06,677 --> 01:06:09,840
Speaker 1: So very briefly There there are a couple different ways to do raid.

922
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:13,100
Speaker 1: Generally, it comes down to doing it in hardware and doing it in software.

923
01:06:13,362 --> 01:06:15,520
Speaker 0: Hardware is the best way if you do it in hardware.

924
01:06:15,706 --> 01:06:27,600
Speaker 0: basically what that means is you buy a machine and you plug a bunch of drives into the machine and the Machine does the raid on its own and it does it with chips and things like that and it's very fast and it's very reliable.

925
01:06:27,982 --> 01:06:32,300
Speaker 0: And your computer your actual computer doesn't know this raid going on.

926
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,304
Speaker 0: It doesn't need to know shit.

927
01:06:33,324 --> 01:06:35,634
Speaker 0: your CPU doesn't do anything your RAM doesn't.

928
01:06:35,654 --> 01:06:38,545
Speaker 0: it doesn't know that there's a raid Computer a disk.

929
01:06:38,645 --> 01:06:42,800
Speaker 0: your computer thinks that it's just one hard drive and it's a really big hard drive.

930
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:46,454
Speaker 1: It's kind of like a net like net is for having a bunch of computers behind.

931
01:06:46,495 --> 01:06:47,880
Speaker 1: then there's one interface to the outside.

932
01:06:48,241 --> 01:06:49,425
Speaker 1: It's like that for hard drives.

933
01:06:49,726 --> 01:06:49,886
Speaker 1: Yep.

934
01:06:50,227 --> 01:06:58,692
Speaker 1: It's super good super awesome super expensive very expensive Difficult to manage and it's all scuzzy which means the drive all scuzzy.

935
01:06:58,712 --> 01:06:59,615
Speaker 1: This is plenty much.

936
01:06:59,655 --> 01:07:01,500
Speaker 0: Nah, there are hardware acla t-rays.

937
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,266
Speaker 0: It's expensive.

938
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:16,560
Speaker 1: There aren't many that they're out there There aren't many and very few people use them and a lot of things that Say they'll do raid with a card or something with serial ATA are actually software raid And they're not really like good hardware real raid.

939
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:27,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are some boxes you can buy that you can actually not just cards that you would put in your computer But actual boxes that drives go in that do a hardware raid like some NAS and SAN type things.

940
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:28,763
Speaker 0: But don't worry about that.

941
01:07:29,265 --> 01:07:31,675
Speaker 1: every raid you run into is software raid.

942
01:07:32,037 --> 01:07:33,784
Speaker 1: pretty much now Here's the kicker.

943
01:07:33,865 --> 01:07:41,232
Speaker 1: a lot of people see a motherboard or whatever and it says oh Supports raid zero one zero plus one and five and jbud.

944
01:07:41,412 --> 01:07:43,980
Speaker 1: and you might think hey, it's a hardware raid isn't the hardware?

945
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,120
Speaker 1: Actually, it doesn't do it in the hardware at all.

946
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:54,923
Speaker 1: It just makes it easy for your processor and your stuff and your operating system to do it, but it's still basically Software raid.

947
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:57,751
Speaker 0: Yeah, it might be a little bit of hardware raid like.

948
01:07:57,812 --> 01:08:07,948
Speaker 0: it has some raid functions built into it But you still need some sort of driver and your operating system has to know it's a raid and your operating system has to deal With it in some way or another.

949
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:17,260
Speaker 0: and that's why a lot of those raids Will work only with certain operating systems and under certain conditions, and they're really not all that fast or that reliable.

950
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:20,872
Speaker 0: But if you make them work, it is a raid five.

951
01:08:21,173 --> 01:08:23,120
Speaker 0: It's just not as good a raid five now.

952
01:08:23,602 --> 01:08:32,279
Speaker 1: Here is the primary problem with people out there using raids Outside of corporate server environments even though I personally like raid a lot.

953
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:36,279
Speaker 1: I plan to build a fairly extensive raid system in my new computer.

954
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:54,537
Speaker 1: but raid at its fundamental core the way it accesses discs puts a lot more stress on them than normal access would and Especially if you're doing raid with consumer level hard drives, you know, you buy a serial ATA Car drive at Best Buy.

955
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:56,950
Speaker 1: Yeah a max tour a Seagate or something.

956
01:08:57,371 --> 01:09:05,037
Speaker 1: These drives are not really ready to handle that amount of stress and they're going to fail on you at a much higher rate than They otherwise would have.

957
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:09,790
Speaker 1: so you will end up buying Replacement drives more often than you would otherwise.

958
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:15,707
Speaker 0: I mean if you just buy a hard drive and just keep using it sure one day it'll fail and you lose all your data If you didn't back it up.

959
01:09:16,113 --> 01:09:20,161
Speaker 0: But it'll probably fail Many years from now unless you're crazy using it too much.

960
01:09:20,603 --> 01:09:24,517
Speaker 0: if you put that drive in a raid like a raid One with one other drive.

961
01:09:25,059 --> 01:09:27,227
Speaker 0: It'll probably fail like in two years.

962
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:29,314
Speaker 1: Well, luckily It's the.

963
01:09:29,617 --> 01:09:31,450
Speaker 1: the lower lumber raids don't do it so much.

964
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:32,694
Speaker 1: It's mostly raid five or eight.

965
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:39,376
Speaker 1: zero is pretty nasty though raid five is the worst because you're constantly Fiddling with the parity data.

966
01:09:39,617 --> 01:09:43,812
Speaker 1: So all the drives are being accessed all the time You're.

967
01:09:43,893 --> 01:09:51,243
Speaker 1: as a result you're gonna wear those drives out and Professional SCSI drives and servers are much more apt to deal with this.

968
01:09:51,746 --> 01:09:54,596
Speaker 1: your consumer level hard drives We're not designed with raid in mind.

969
01:09:54,817 --> 01:09:56,424
Speaker 1: They're not built at the same tolerances.

970
01:09:56,464 --> 01:09:58,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not as reliable.

971
01:09:58,131 --> 01:09:59,629
Speaker 1: They can't handle the heat as well.

972
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:04,250
Speaker 0: Yep, they still might last for a year or two, but they're not gonna last in super long term.

973
01:10:04,712 --> 01:10:09,370
Speaker 1: So I guess what my warning here is that you might think oh, I'll just build a raid five.

974
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:10,369
Speaker 1: My data's safe forever.

975
01:10:10,972 --> 01:10:17,508
Speaker 1: Be aware that you're gonna have to have an extra hard drive on hand to be ready to replace one when they die because they're Going to die.

976
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:19,356
Speaker 0: Here's the other thing that you got to know about.

977
01:10:19,557 --> 01:10:25,597
Speaker 0: in a fancy server like a data center if a hard drive crashes You can just without doing anything.

978
01:10:25,637 --> 01:10:28,807
Speaker 0: Just pull the hard drive right out of there and slide another one in.

979
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:29,489
Speaker 0: just whoop whoop.

980
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:31,395
Speaker 1: Yes, you realize in fancy servers.

981
01:10:31,877 --> 01:10:34,324
Speaker 1: I have hot swapped PCI cards.

982
01:10:34,746 --> 01:10:36,170
Speaker 1: I have hot swapped hard drives.

983
01:10:36,672 --> 01:10:38,318
Speaker 1: I hot swapped RAM.

984
01:10:38,338 --> 01:10:41,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, hot swap means that you can take it out and plug it in while the computer's on.

985
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:42,614
Speaker 0: It's a USB.

986
01:10:42,654 --> 01:10:44,845
Speaker 0: You can just plug USB things in while the computer's on.

987
01:10:44,926 --> 01:10:48,050
Speaker 1: Yeah fancy computers You can do that with hard drives and cards and everything.

988
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:52,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could just take the CPU out put one in while the computers on but you can't take all the CPUs Not all of them.

989
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:54,927
Speaker 0: But there's some where you could take a CPU out.

990
01:10:55,712 --> 01:11:00,050
Speaker 0: You could put sticks of RAM in the computer while it's on and then it will add that RAM to the computer.

991
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,447
Speaker 0: There are computers like that.

992
01:11:02,011 --> 01:11:04,037
Speaker 0: Your computer your computer is not like that.

993
01:11:04,298 --> 01:11:09,842
Speaker 0: pretty much the only thing you can hot swap on your computer is like a CD ROM Or a USB or a firewire.

994
01:11:10,164 --> 01:11:10,909
Speaker 0: that's about it.

995
01:11:11,412 --> 01:11:22,359
Speaker 0: so if your raid has a problem you pretty much have to shut it down immediately and take the drive out and put a new drive in and Figure out which drive you have to replace.

996
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:28,621
Speaker 0: because if you don't have the fancy box with the lights on it telling you which one Crashed you got to figure out which one crashed.

997
01:11:28,882 --> 01:11:31,190
Speaker 0: you might replace the wrong one and now you're in trouble.

998
01:11:32,651 --> 01:11:43,989
Speaker 0: So it's not that easy to have a consumer raid and raid isn't really meant for consumers And that's why things like the Drobo I talked about in the news are pretty hot because it brings something like raid.

999
01:11:44,695 --> 01:11:53,493
Speaker 0: You know that sort of redundancy and data safety to the consumer with ease and not a lot of effort or all these troubles that You can have.

1000
01:11:54,036 --> 01:11:55,040
Speaker 1: and on that note.

1001
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,787
Speaker 0: There's there's one more thing one more thing.

1002
01:11:56,807 --> 01:11:57,530
Speaker 1: We've gone long already.

1003
01:11:57,550 --> 01:12:02,310
Speaker 0: You can do a software raid even if you don't have a motherboard that has anything for it.

1004
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:02,410
Speaker 0: Oh,

1005
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:06,232
Speaker 1: yeah, in fact in Windows you can pretty much just click in the disk manager and say make a raid go Yeah

1006
01:12:06,252 --> 01:12:13,685
Speaker 0: in Linux you can just be like if you just had three drives Plugged into your computer and your motherboard is like stupidly old, but it can plug in three drives.

1007
01:12:14,086 --> 01:12:21,190
Speaker 0: You can just say alright Combine those three partitions on the three drives into one drive and yeah do a raid one and it'll do it.

1008
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:27,130
Speaker 0: You have to configure it and stuff, but you can do it entirely in software with no help from the hardware whatsoever.

1009
01:12:34,491 --> 01:12:37,081
