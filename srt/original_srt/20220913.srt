1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,488
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, September 13th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:10,709
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:14,657
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,226
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:19,560
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are talking about multiplayer game servers.

6
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:22,938
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:29,230
Speaker 0: So, the place in which I live, you know, New York City, right?

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:38,810
Speaker 0: Most of the establishments of commerce, right, are gonna be your small, you know, tight places that are in a mixed zone building, right?

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,669
Speaker 0: You know, bodegas, nail salons, restaurants, right?

10
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:47,970
Speaker 0: You got a few larger grocery stores here and there, but they're not, like, supermarkets from the suburbs, right?

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,110
Speaker 0: Those only exist in car places, pretty much, right?

12
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:58,550
Speaker 0: You know, and then I guess the third kind might be, like, Fancy Manhattan Store would be the third kind of establishment, right?

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,570
Speaker 0: You know, but lately, you know, there have been more suburban-style establishments, right?

14
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,589
Speaker 0: There's a Wegmans in Brooklyn.

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,850
Speaker 0: They're gonna open a Wegmans where, I guess it's not a new one.

16
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,830
Speaker 1: I was about to mention that other Wegmans that's coming.

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:16,070
Speaker 0: The other Wegmans is in a former Kmart location, so it's not really a change from city-style to suburban-style.

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:32,890
Speaker 0: But one suburban-style commerce establishment that has existed in New York for as long as I've lived here, even longer, that I've never gone to, despite the fact that it's literally two or three blocks away from where I live, is Costco.

19
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,190
Speaker 0: There is an enormous Costco.

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,290
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I run past that Costco, like, two or three times a week in the summer.

21
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,670
Speaker 0: Have you ever been in the Costco?

22
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,450
Speaker 1: Never once, though I often, you know what I do?

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:50,150
Speaker 1: There is, a condition of that Costco being built was that they had to make the waterfront accessible to the public.

24
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:51,410
Speaker 0: That is, that is correct.

25
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:57,230
Speaker 1: So there's a really nice waterfront park that connects, like, kind of between the Socrates sculpture, like, there's this nice little park back there.

26
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,550
Speaker 0: It goes from Socrates to Rainy Park, like, this little tiny path behind the Costco.

27
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:02,730
Speaker 1: It's a nice little running path.

28
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,490
Speaker 1: There are almost always cool dudes fishing back there, families having little picnics.

29
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:08,229
Speaker 1: It's actually a pretty nice place.

30
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,970
Speaker 1: If I was a kid, that is the place our parents would have dumped us while they shopped, because it is a pain in the ass to shop with kids.

31
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,110
Speaker 0: There are many kids dumped back there.

32
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,930
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know, I've been thinking, you know, because the economy has fucked the fuck up.

33
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,430
Speaker 1: Oh, I got some, I can talk about some fuck-the-fuck-up economy.

34
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:26,789
Speaker 1: PAX, uh, PAX was weird.

35
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:27,970
Speaker 1: I'll leave it at that.

36
00:02:28,153 --> 00:02:29,190
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that in a minute.

37
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:38,250
Speaker 0: But anyway, even though the economy has fucked the fuck up, despite the fact that I'm admittedly very affluent, right, I'm like, you know, it wouldn't hurt to save some money at the Costco.

38
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,990
Speaker 0: The reason I've never gone to the Costco is because it's like, I don't have a lot of room in my apartment.

39
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:49,790
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I order, like, one 12-pack of toilet paper and we get a new one when we're down to, like, four rolls left.

40
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,930
Speaker 1: Like, I do not keep stuff.

41
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,170
Speaker 0: So I'm like, yeah, I could go in there and I could buy something large, right, to save money, you know, per unit, at least on the unit price.

42
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:11,910
Speaker 0: But if I don't finish or use all of that before it spoils, assuming it's a spoilable good, or if it takes up too much space and I have nowhere to store it in my small apartment, that's like I'm not really saving any money here, right, if I'm throwing stuff away.

43
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:24,450
Speaker 0: You know, one time I bought a, um, I bought a giant Kirkland olive oil on the internet, and whoever I bought it from obviously just arbitraged and went to Costco and bought the olive oil and sold it to me as a markup.

44
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,595
Speaker 1: I'm pretty confident.

45
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:29,309
Speaker 1: a lot of things I could buy on Amazon are just people doing that at Costco's.

46
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:39,741
Speaker 0: Very, I've seen people, I've bought things on Amazon in the past, you know, maybe a handful of times, and gotten a Costco email, right?

47
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,166
Speaker 0: Someone just went to Costco.com, bought it, and put in my address, right?

48
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:48,610
Speaker 0: So, which I could start doing now, because if it wasn't clear- Whoa, so you actually got a membership.

49
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:57,643
Speaker 0: Right, right, because I was like, you know, I'm like, it's 60 bucks for the cheap membership, you know, 120 for the, I'm not sure if it's actually a good deal, better membership, right?

50
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:02,010
Speaker 0: And I'm like, you know, we'll try it, worst case, I'm out 60 bucks, right?

51
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:09,860
Speaker 0: If we go in there, and we don't buy anything, then I'll just won't renew, and I'll be out 60 bucks, I've spent more on less in the past, right?

52
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:17,450
Speaker 0: Um, and if it, somehow it's good, and we get a bunch of stuff, then good, I didn't waste my money, right?

53
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:28,245
Speaker 0: It's like, um, so for the first time ever, we went and bought a membership, we went to the Costco, and I haven't, I have been in these kind of warehouse-y stores in the past, but not this millennia.

54
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:32,150
Speaker 0: Lately, I'm doing a lot of things that I've done before, but not this millennia.

55
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, that could be a good Thursday show, actually, that specific topic.

56
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:39,689
Speaker 1: I'm in a similar boat for a lot of reasons, COVID being one of them.

57
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,429
Speaker 0: Watch television, you know, things like that.

58
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:48,170
Speaker 1: At night, you know, we've been doing them every now and then over dinner, watching, like, PBS, the news.

59
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:49,637
Speaker 0: Ugh.

60
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, weird.

61
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,114
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I got some good things about Costco.

62
00:04:56,174 --> 00:05:06,710
Speaker 0: Number one, we did indeed buy many things in there that I didn't expect that would be in there, and we saved a lot of money, and it was worth it from a commerce perspective, right?

63
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,941
Speaker 0: Big box of fig bars, we got, like, electric toothbrush heads, those are real expensive, right?

64
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:17,370
Speaker 0: And it was, it was expensive, it was like a pack of, like, a whole bunch for 50 bucks.

65
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,350
Speaker 1: I go to your house, there's, like, a shipping container full of toothbrushes.

66
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,959
Speaker 0: No, it was, like, one big package of, like, maybe 20-something, I'm not sure how many, but it was a lot, right?

67
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:31,990
Speaker 0: For 50 bucks, which seems like a lot, but if you go online, like, three cost, like, 30 bucks, right?

68
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,495
Speaker 0: So it was a huge savings, right, despite the high price.

69
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:39,100
Speaker 0: The butter was the best deal, right?

70
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,010
Speaker 0: It's like, if you go to the grocery store in New York City, and you buy butter, it's like, two sticks could be four or five dollars.

71
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,374
Speaker 0: Four sticks could be, like, six, seven dollars, right?

72
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:54,641
Speaker 0: I was able to get, not just any butter, the fancy Irish Kerrygold butter, right?

73
00:05:55,061 --> 00:06:01,890
Speaker 0: It was a box, and the box contained eight butters, but they were double butters, two sticks worth each.

74
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,280
Speaker 0: So, effectively, 16 butters, right?

75
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:08,570
Speaker 0: For, like, $15.

76
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,270
Speaker 1: That's too much butter to put in my fridge, unless I'm using it imminently.

77
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:18,346
Speaker 0: But it's, like, it's basically, it was, like, buy three butters, get one free, which is 25% off.

78
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:19,490
Speaker 0: butter is, like, a huge deal.

79
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,449
Speaker 1: Well, it's keeping the fridge, like, it's not gonna go bad.

80
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they weren't, it wasn't that large, physically, right?

81
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:29,008
Speaker 0: It's, like, it's more butter than you would normally have in your fridge, but it wasn't, like, buying 24 rolls of TP.

82
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,190
Speaker 1: You cram, like, two of those way in the back of the fridge, and you put two up front.

83
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,329
Speaker 0: 56 rolls of TP against 24 wouldn't be that big.

84
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:34,599
Speaker 0: Yeah.

85
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:35,673
Speaker 0: So that was good.

86
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:40,670
Speaker 0: There's also, people are correct, there are some services you can avail yourself of at Costco without a membership.

87
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:48,270
Speaker 1: I was always told the best thing at Costco, I never verified this, this is based on, like, some guy saying this, but it was multiple some guys over the years.

88
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:52,508
Speaker 1: If you go to a Costco that has a tire center, you buy car tires, and they're, like, nothing.

89
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,357
Speaker 0: Our Costco does, indeed, have the tire center.

90
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:56,701
Speaker 0: It has the food court.

91
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,490
Speaker 0: It also has the liquor store, which, obviously, I don't drink.

92
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:03,290
Speaker 0: But it's, if you want to buy liquor, you can go there without a membership.

93
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,790
Speaker 1: They got various king and ducal peas of various qualities.

94
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,439
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm sure it would be cheaper than normal if they had that in stock, right?

95
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:14,710
Speaker 0: I mean, I think that's the downside of the Costco, is, like, there's no reliable inventory.

96
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,300
Speaker 0: Like, you can't go there expecting something to be there.

97
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,770
Speaker 0: It's, like, they got what they got right now, right?

98
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,009
Speaker 0: You know, because that's what they've got.

99
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,210
Speaker 1: Plus, booze is hard to shop discount for, unless you're an alcoholic, because, like, I like booze.

100
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,102
Speaker 0: The quantities were large, but they had, the selection was large.

101
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:33,170
Speaker 0: There's a whole separate place to buy booze.

102
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,584
Speaker 1: I buy, like, a bottle of whiskey every seven to fifteen months.

103
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:40,570
Speaker 1: Like, it's not like I drink this stuff that fast.

104
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:50,250
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously, I would obviously tell someone never drink poison ever, but if you're gonna drink the poison, even me, a non-poisoned drinker, it's, like, it's probably a good deal.

105
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,698
Speaker 0: All right, so it was the bad, the bad parts of the Costco, right?

106
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:58,470
Speaker 0: The bad part was that, due to circumstances, right, we went there Saturday afternoon.

107
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:07,610
Speaker 1: Oh, no, when I run past that place, part of the reason I run through that park, people are, like, blocking the sidewalk down the street trying to get into this place.

108
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,200
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, we walked in with our little wagon.

109
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,830
Speaker 0: We didn't use a car, so that wasn't a problem.

110
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,230
Speaker 0: What was a problem is that the aisles in the store, at least the New York one, were too narrow.

111
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,275
Speaker 0: They were, like, bare, two wagons.

112
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:19,841
Speaker 0: Everyone uses the giant wagons there.

113
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:22,690
Speaker 0: We were using our pole wagon that we brought, you know, our own wagon.

114
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:28,610
Speaker 0: But the wagons that everyone uses are, they, basically, two of them can barely fit in an aisle.

115
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,304
Speaker 0: So, if there's even one person who's not fully to the side of an aisle, the aisle's blocked.

116
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:34,529
Speaker 0: It's, like, no one can go.

117
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:38,830
Speaker 0: And if you try to turn around the ends of the aisles, it's, like, it's not any wider on the end cap.

118
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,481
Speaker 0: It's just, like, it's really hard to move around that store.

119
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,949
Speaker 0: I would recommend going at a different time.

120
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:49,720
Speaker 0: But, yeah, I was, I was, I was expecting to have thrown away $60.

121
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,270
Speaker 0: I was pleasantly surprised I didn't throw it away.

122
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:55,757
Speaker 0: We'll see how many, I still might not renew.

123
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:59,330
Speaker 0: It depends how many more times I go in a year, because, like, we stocked up.

124
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,754
Speaker 0: Like, when am I going to need more butter now?

125
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:10,550
Speaker 0: Maybe I won't need it again this year, in which case I'm not going to pay 60 bucks in order to get a discount on butter.

126
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:20,750
Speaker 0: But, you know, it was, it was an experience, a novel experience, and there was some things they had there that I was surprised I wasn't expecting to see there.

127
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:25,289
Speaker 0: Giant bag of pistachio nuts, you know, come on.

128
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:31,099
Speaker 1: So, I was, of course, me and Emily were at PAX West the other weekend.

129
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,810
Speaker 1: We're well out of the incubation period, so I guess we did, in fact, avoid COVID at it, and now I'm boosted.

130
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:37,650
Speaker 0: So, uh, alright.

131
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:45,910
Speaker 0: I got boosted yesterday at the Costco pharmacy, which is just as good as the Rite Aid pharmacy, only there's less slow people waiting in line.

132
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:46,949
Speaker 1: Good to know.

133
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:51,350
Speaker 0: I think you might be able to use that without a membership as well, I'm not sure.

134
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:58,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a bunch, depending on the state you're in, too, different states have rules where Costco's will have things that technically they have to let you use.

135
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:04,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I went to it, and they did not check my membership card when I entered the store or at the pharmacy, so.

136
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:10,060
Speaker 1: So, uh, PAX West was interesting because it was still a small PAX West.

137
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,526
Speaker 1: It was not even close to sold out.

138
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:14,009
Speaker 1: The scalpers were like...

139
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,270
Speaker 0: Well, they were pushing hard on Twitter to sell tickets on the internet.

140
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,375
Speaker 1: Oh, the dudes in the street?

141
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,570
Speaker 1: There were still the same number of them as always was the crazy thing.

142
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,389
Speaker 1: They were like...

143
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:28,450
Speaker 0: They're probably there for every single, you know, public convention center event, and you'd probably go over to the stadiums during every sporting event.

144
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:34,130
Speaker 1: At normal PAXes, pre-COVID, those dudes would be, like, selling them for, like, nearly what PAX sells them for.

145
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,430
Speaker 1: Here, they would buy them from you for, like, ten bucks when you were leaving, because people leaving really didn't go back in.

146
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,896
Speaker 1: People, of course, expo hall and bail.

147
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:43,710
Speaker 1: And they were selling them back to people for, like, five bucks.

148
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:45,558
Speaker 1: So...

149
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,329
Speaker 0: They were losing money on scalping?

150
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:56,470
Speaker 1: No, they were buying them for five bucks, they were selling them to people for ten bucks, they were making basically, like, five dollar profit on each one of these badges, which isn't bad for nothing.

151
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:57,989
Speaker 1: Just hanging out outside, I guess.

152
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:05,290
Speaker 0: I mean, first of all, right, suddenly, right, everyone's mad at the scalpers when, you know, they're jacking up the price.

153
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:11,190
Speaker 0: But look, here in this situation, right, you know, arguments that capitalism should be destroyed aside.

154
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,007
Speaker 1: Right?

155
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:15,910
Speaker 1: Just assume that's our Carthago de Lendem Est on any conversation.

156
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:24,830
Speaker 0: Arbitrage suddenly becomes useful, right, when supply is high, like, "Oh, look, you don't have to pay fucking full price to go into the PAX, you know, that's perhaps sub-par.

157
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:27,310
Speaker 0: The scalper is actually a good guy suddenly.

158
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:28,909
Speaker 1: But I think there's a phenomenon...

159
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,845
Speaker 0: Not to defend the scalper, right?

160
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,950
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, again, the scalper is not the core problem.

161
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,370
Speaker 0: Don't be mad at the scalper.

162
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,270
Speaker 1: Very side effects.

163
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,410
Speaker 0: Not the player, yes.

164
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:46,828
Speaker 1: But what's interesting is that I think this is going to continue even after COVID, this trend, partly because what seems to be happening is...

165
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:49,069
Speaker 0: I don't think there is an after COVID.

166
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,530
Speaker 1: Well, as far as, like, as good as it gets and everything's as normal as it's ever going to be again...

167
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,509
Speaker 0: It's like, we're not after flu right now.

168
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,590
Speaker 0: It's like, there's going to be some sort of COVID forever.

169
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,710
Speaker 0: We're just going to live, like, and deal with it, suffer, you know, just like we suffer with flu and everything else.

170
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:15,610
Speaker 1: But I do think this is going to escalate incredibly because there's a lot... I feel like this PAX, almost everyone who was there was only there for expo haul.

171
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:23,970
Speaker 1: Like, the ratio of expo only versus literally anything else was the starkest I've ever seen at any PAX ever by a wide margin.

172
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,430
Speaker 1: Pretty much everyone came just on Saturday just for expo.

173
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:33,810
Speaker 1: All the other days were mostly quiet and empty and all the non-expo areas were mostly quiet and empty.

174
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,290
Speaker 1: Big panels, got giant crowds, of course, like big celebrity panels.

175
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,770
Speaker 1: Uh, main events never filled despite...

176
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,950
Speaker 0: Did you go to the Reggie panel?

177
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:42,320
Speaker 1: Uh, no, I didn't.

178
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,250
Speaker 1: We were busy with some other stuff.

179
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:44,389
Speaker 0: That's a shame.

180
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was streamed, actually.

181
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:49,070
Speaker 0: I'm sure I'll be able to see it if I really want to.

182
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,129
Speaker 0: I don't know how good it is.

183
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,088
Speaker 0: It just, you know, be in the same room as Reggie, be like, "Oh, there's that

184
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:53,269
Speaker 0: guy.".

185
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,370
Speaker 1: So it was a weird PAX in that they didn't have any of the external venues.

186
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,298
Speaker 1: There was nothing in, uh...

187
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:05,370
Speaker 0: Well, the external venues are for the... Oh, you mean the PAX-rented external venues.

188
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:13,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there was... Main Theatre was actually just in the ballroom where normally Tabletop Expo is in the Hyatt Regency.

189
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,390
Speaker 1: And that was the only PAX thing in that building.

190
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,630
Speaker 1: Tabletop was just the entire top floor of the Seattle Convention Center.

191
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:23,830
Speaker 1: I note it is no longer the Washington State Convention Center.

192
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,970
Speaker 1: It is now the Seattle Convention Center.

193
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,650
Speaker 1: The rules around it have changed.

194
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,670
Speaker 1: They can bar the public from entry, which they did for this PAX.

195
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:32,029
Speaker 1: They even closed the park.

196
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,470
Speaker 1: The park behind the convention center was for PAX only.

197
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,268
Speaker 1: You can only get to it from inside of PAX.

198
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:39,030
Speaker 0: Do we know why this happened?

199
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,690
Speaker 1: I don't know the full deal, so I'm not going to speculate.

200
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,889
Speaker 1: But they renamed it, they rebranded it, there's signs everywhere about it.

201
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:50,630
Speaker 1: And there's that other convention center space that they were talking about building.

202
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,310
Speaker 1: It is very near completion and it is fucking gigantic.

203
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,709
Speaker 0: Oh, the one that's where the buses used to be?

204
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,209
Speaker 1: Holy shit, is it big.

205
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,090
Speaker 0: Is that going to be the Washington State Convention Center?

206
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:02,909
Speaker 0: Is that what the deal is?

207
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,195
Speaker 1: I don't know.

208
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:04,090
Speaker 1: I expect PAX...

209
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,309
Speaker 0: Or is it all going to be one thing?

210
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:06,147
Speaker 1: I don't know.

211
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:13,630
Speaker 0: I don't know any event that could even... The Paxist of peak PAX could probably not fill all of that.

212
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,950
Speaker 1: Peak PAX could fill both of those if they stop using the higher regency for tabletop.

213
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,230
Speaker 1: And just put tabletop in the convention.

214
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,970
Speaker 0: Oh, if they stop using any other building whatsoever?

215
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:28,170
Speaker 1: I bet they still use Benaroya for main events or Paramount for main events.

216
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,510
Speaker 1: I think they'll keep doing that kind of stuff.

217
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,710
Speaker 1: Apparently the only reason they didn't have them for this PAX was like, Hamilton was in one of them, like pre-arranged.

218
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,948
Speaker 1: And something else was in the other one, like there was big stuff going on.

219
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,650
Speaker 0: That reminds me, the Met Opera season starts soon.

220
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:47,110
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe it's time to mask up and go to an opera.

221
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,229
Speaker 1: But I digress.

222
00:14:49,010 --> 00:15:08,030
Speaker 1: The PAX itself, tabletop, despite it being such a tiny PAX, on Saturday and also on Sunday during primetime hours, because tabletop was so tiny, being just the top floor of the SCC, it was completely full, there were no tables, there was nowhere to sit, it was crammed with people.

223
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:09,610
Speaker 1: The other two days?

224
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,070
Speaker 0: I thought you said the non-expo areas were not crowded.

225
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,276
Speaker 0: Just tabletop.

226
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:15,410
Speaker 1: Only tabletop freeplay.

227
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,330
Speaker 1: Because tabletop freeplay was like a fifth of the tabletop space.

228
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,770
Speaker 1: There was almost no tabletop freeplay space.

229
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,209
Speaker 1: All the tabletop space was magic and tabletop tourney and tabletop expo.

230
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:29,969
Speaker 0: Oh, alright.

231
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,350
Speaker 1: So there were hardly any tables for freeplay.

232
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,387
Speaker 1: Pretty much everyone was just freeplaying in hotels.

233
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,890
Speaker 0: Freeplay is not a moneymaker.

234
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:41,750
Speaker 0: Every room you make freeplay is a room that costs the convention money and doesn't bring in any revenue.

235
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:48,150
Speaker 1: So when I say tabletop freeplay was full and you couldn't get a table, that's because there were only like 40 tables total.

236
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,693
Speaker 1: Our panel got.

237
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:54,810
Speaker 1: a whole ton of people came to the panel, I think that went really well.

238
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,849
Speaker 1: It was a pretty okay normal PAX.

239
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:16,230
Speaker 1: However, and I want to preface this very much, I do not want to imply that I am saying anything that you might see like Fox News type dipshit people say, but Seattle did not recover well from the earlier days of the pandemic.

240
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:23,890
Speaker 1: The entire area around the convention center in every direction is pretty fucking rough right now.

241
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:25,848
Speaker 1: A whole bunch of businesses just boarded up.

242
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,150
Speaker 1: Lots of restaurants are gone, stores are gone.

243
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,430
Speaker 1: The businesses that are open all had smash out windows everywhere.

244
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:39,150
Speaker 1: The Bartels, the drugstore near the convention center, someone smashed the window out between Friday and Saturday.

245
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:45,850
Speaker 1: Every store has guards wearing like fucking fake ass body armor standing outside their doors, acting like bouncers.

246
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,510
Speaker 1: There are angry and altercation ready people all over the streets.

247
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:56,730
Speaker 1: I had several specific, honestly dangerous altercations.

248
00:16:57,732 --> 00:17:00,310
Speaker 1: And there are fucking cops everywhere.

249
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:04,849
Speaker 1: Like more cops than you see in Times Square, everywhere in Seattle.

250
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,569
Speaker 1: It was just weird and rough.

251
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:14,006
Speaker 0: Well, clearly the one thing you can take away from that is cops everywhere has not solved the problem, has it?

252
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:22,150
Speaker 0: If cops are the solution and there's cops everywhere, why is it so rough?

253
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:23,848
Speaker 0: That's the takeaway I have.

254
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:34,210
Speaker 1: This is a combination of the economy of a small city like Seattle not even being close to recovering at the rate that larger cities did.

255
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,488
Speaker 1: Not that larger cities have recovered.

256
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,850
Speaker 0: I think it's also like downtown Seattle, right?

257
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:46,650
Speaker 0: Something like a pandemic will make you leave there.

258
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,889
Speaker 1: Oh, it looks like that's happening.

259
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:49,656
Speaker 1: I was looking around at rents.

260
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,689
Speaker 1: Rents look like they're way down in downtown Seattle and people are just GTFOing.

261
00:17:55,051 --> 00:18:02,090
Speaker 0: Right, it's not like New York where there's an extremely strong reason to live in New York City.

262
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,570
Speaker 0: What's the benefit of living in downtown Seattle?

263
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,130
Speaker 0: It's like you can walk to Pike Place Market as your grocery.

264
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:15,408
Speaker 1: Emily's bosses live right above Pike Place, right in that area apparently, and they love it.

265
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:21,849
Speaker 1: I think Seattle downtown is going the route of Hartford pretty fast.

266
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:29,890
Speaker 0: Especially since Seattle actually does not the best job, far from as good a job as they should be doing.

267
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,030
Speaker 1: There's so many asterisks we've got to put into this conversation.

268
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:39,730
Speaker 0: Better than most places in terms of having a good public transport to downtown Seattle.

269
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:44,410
Speaker 0: They got the light rail and the bus system is not complete garbage.

270
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:56,750
Speaker 0: You can reasonably live outside of downtown Seattle in a different place, in a fancy suburb place, and get to downtown Seattle when you need to get there.

271
00:18:57,531 --> 00:19:04,690
Speaker 0: Faster than someone living where we used to live takes the metro north to New York City, and the cost of living will be much lower.

272
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:08,004
Speaker 1: There's also way more bike lanes, fantastically.

273
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:09,309
Speaker 1: There's just bike lanes everywhere now.

274
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,870
Speaker 1: But nobody fucking rides in them, and everyone's riding on the sidewalk anyway.

275
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,069
Speaker 0: Well the hills are an issue.

276
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:22,150
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but despite the fact that there are bike lanes everywhere, every single person on a bike is on the sidewalk.

277
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:28,630
Speaker 1: And those Lime electric scooters that were the bane of San Antonio were clogging up all of downtown Seattle.

278
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:34,189
Speaker 0: I mean people can just go watch any of the, you know, not just bikes, YouTube or whatever, and learn why that is.

279
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:34,911
Speaker 1: Yup.

280
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:39,203
Speaker 1: So it's like, I wouldn't have even talked about this.

281
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:41,830
Speaker 1: That's not the kind of thing I would mention, even visiting a city.

282
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,830
Speaker 1: Because cities are all different and the world's kind of fucked and capitalism is a toxic cancer on the earth.

283
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:50,989
Speaker 1: But it was honestly so bad that it stuck with me.

284
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:57,137
Speaker 1: There's never been a place I have been and returned to.

285
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:03,509
Speaker 1: that has gotten so radically different for the worse, so fast compared to Seattle in my entire life.

286
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:05,939
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't that fast.

287
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,209
Speaker 0: It was like three years, right?

288
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, but three years and I go back and it's like a totally different city.

289
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:14,040
Speaker 1: And Detroit actually got better when I went back.

290
00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:16,990
Speaker 1: Most places I visited have gotten better or at least neutral.

291
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:18,885
Speaker 1: But Seattle is just...

292
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,769
Speaker 0: Fortunes rise and fall.

293
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:22,614
Speaker 1: Yup.

294
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:26,230
Speaker 1: I think it'll be a challenge for PEX as this continues, too.

295
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,902
Speaker 1: Because it was definitely causing issues and altercations around the convention center.

296
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,369
Speaker 1: that I think will be more of a problem as time goes on.

297
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:38,410
Speaker 1: Unless something radical changes in the entire American economy and government.

298
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,590
Speaker 0: What'll it mean for that new giant convention center that they're building?

299
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,456
Speaker 1: I don't know.

300
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:43,728
Speaker 1: I think this can actually hurt.

301
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:48,870
Speaker 0: Who's gonna want to run an event there if it's not a nice place to go, right?

302
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,904
Speaker 1: I think it could actually hurt the usage of that convention center.

303
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,730
Speaker 1: We'll see how it goes.

304
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,270
Speaker 1: But it was rough to the point that it was actually notable.

305
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:07,690
Speaker 1: In much lighter news, and I think the only real news we're gonna talk about in this segment today, the Nintendo Direct happened.

306
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,029
Speaker 1: So we can at least cover all the important bits.

307
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,219
Speaker 0: I thought it was gonna be at 1.

308
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,610
Speaker 0: It was at 10 AM, at least our time.

309
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:14,073
Speaker 0: I know!

310
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:17,185
Speaker 1: I had a note in my calendar, but it was one of those all-day notes.

311
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:18,330
Speaker 1: I didn't really think about it.

312
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,210
Speaker 1: So I got online to go to the Discord, like, "Alright, when's the Nintendo...".

313
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,819
Speaker 1: "Oh, it's almost... Oh, fuck.

314
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:24,221
Speaker 1: Okay.".

315
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,730
Speaker 0: Anyway, most of the announcements were stuff nobody cares about, as usual.

316
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:31,318
Speaker 1: Yup.

317
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,210
Speaker 0: Notable announcements.

318
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:39,190
Speaker 0: There's a remake of, I believe... I think it's the GameCube Kirby game, maybe?

319
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:41,082
Speaker 0: It's a previous Kirby game.

320
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:42,090
Speaker 0: It's getting an HD remake.

321
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:43,112
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

322
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:44,927
Speaker 1: Kirby's Return to Dreamland Deluxe.

323
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:46,572
Speaker 0: Yup.

324
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:47,669
Speaker 0: So that's one.

325
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,135
Speaker 1: I'll probably play that.

326
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:50,689
Speaker 1: I'd put it in these kinds of remakes.

327
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,730
Speaker 0: I still didn't play the new, actually new Switch Kirby.

328
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:00,530
Speaker 0: So I don't know why I would go back and play this remake of an old one that I missed.

329
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:07,309
Speaker 1: They announced, like, I saw a bunch of people in my timeline really excited about Octopath Traveler 2, which I guess...

330
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:13,890
Speaker 0: I played the demo, and it's like I can understand why JRPG people are all over the Octopath Traveler.

331
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,570
Speaker 0: Like, if I was a JRPG person, that would be the one.

332
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:17,329
Speaker 0: Oh, absolutely.

333
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:18,426
Speaker 0: I'm not.

334
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,043
Speaker 1: Yup.

335
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,329
Speaker 1: GoldenEye 007 with online play was actually a surprise to me.

336
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:34,189
Speaker 0: Right, so if you have Nintendo Switch online, you can play NES, SNES, Genesis, and N64 games on the Switch.

337
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:39,810
Speaker 0: It's not a full library, but it's basically all of the S-tier titles, like most of them.

338
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,225
Speaker 0: Yup.

339
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,830
Speaker 0: But there are a bunch of N64 S-tier titles that were missing.

340
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,089
Speaker 0: They just announced they're adding a significant portion of those.

341
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:56,217
Speaker 1: GoldenEye, Pilotwings, Mario Party, Mario Party, Mario Party, Pokemon Stadium, Pokemon Stadium, 1080 Snowboarding, Excitebike 64.

342
00:22:56,217 --> 00:23:08,150
Speaker 1: Yup, so... I'm honestly moderately excited to be able to play GoldenEye 007 online with the caveat that online play has never worked in any Nintendo game, and I don't trust that it'll work with GoldenEye.

343
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:11,049
Speaker 1: I honestly do not think it'll work.

344
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,110
Speaker 1: Like, maybe I'll be wrong, but they've been batting zero with those things working.

345
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,570
Speaker 0: As long as you can play four people with Switches just sitting around, play GoldenEye against each other.

346
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:25,890
Speaker 0: I could see that happening if there are enough people with Switches in the same place, right?

347
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,570
Speaker 0: You don't need a TV, you don't need to... Remember, you used to have to set up, like, TVs and all that, right?

348
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:30,930
Speaker 0: Yup.

349
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:38,470
Speaker 1: Though I have found, in my experience with the Switch, doing local no-TV multiplayer across Switches also doesn't fucking work in most cases.

350
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:42,170
Speaker 0: Local no-TV multiplayer, I guess.

351
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:50,290
Speaker 1: Every time I've tried to do it with a Switch or a 3DS, it never actually worked, but I've only ever tried to do it at conventions where that stuff tends to not work anyway.

352
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:54,089
Speaker 1: But conventions are the place I most often want to do exactly that, so...

353
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:03,210
Speaker 0: Anyway, they announced, I predicted that there would be one of the second-tier first-party franchises that would get a new game announcement, and I was correct.

354
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,610
Speaker 0: Pikmin, they announced Pikmin 4.

355
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,028
Speaker 1: Yeah, moderately excited.

356
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:13,084
Speaker 0: I played the demo of Pikmin 3, and I enjoyed it, but I wasn't like... It didn't make me want to buy and play the whole thing.

357
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:13,870
Speaker 0: It's just like, that's enough.

358
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like it.

359
00:24:16,698 --> 00:24:18,970
Speaker 1: Actually, I kind of want to go back and play the old Pikmins again.

360
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:20,250
Speaker 0: Go ahead.

361
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:21,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I should.

362
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:31,210
Speaker 1: I don't know why people were mad that they didn't announce Breath of the Wild is coming out, or Breath of the Wild 2, because obviously it's coming out next year.

363
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,390
Speaker 1: We've known this forever.

364
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, they announced the date.

365
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,724
Speaker 1: They did not announce.

366
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:36,910
Speaker 1: it is coming out imminently.

367
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,802
Speaker 1: All the people who kept saying, "Oh, they're going to announce it's a Christmas

368
00:24:39,822 --> 00:24:40,002
Speaker 1: game.".

369
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:41,650
Speaker 1: Of course it's not a Christmas game.

370
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,950
Speaker 1: This is coming out in May 12th, next year, and that's fine.

371
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,890
Speaker 0: That's around the time that most Zelda games have come out.

372
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:50,134
Speaker 1: Not a surprise.

373
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:54,007
Speaker 1: Honestly, I'm just ignoring all news about Breath of the Wild 2.

374
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:54,970
Speaker 1: I guess now we know the title.

375
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,353
Speaker 1: Tears of the Kingdom.

376
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:00,604
Speaker 1: Because it's just something I'm going to pre-order.

377
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:02,650
Speaker 1: I'm going to play immediately when it comes out.

378
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,810
Speaker 1: No words anyone says on the internet are going to change what I do when this game comes out.

379
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:08,974
Speaker 0: Yeah.

380
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:10,710
Speaker 0: I don't even know why they need trailers.

381
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:15,910
Speaker 0: They could just be like, you know, if I was Nintendo, right, I would pull a poll.

382
00:25:16,552 --> 00:25:19,130
Speaker 0: They're already pretty secretive, right, but not Apple secretive.

383
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,830
Speaker 0: But I would be like, I would just not say anything.

384
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,142
Speaker 1: On May 11th, it would just be like, "Breath of the Wild 2 has a

385
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:26,383
Speaker 1: date.".

386
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,675
Speaker 0: Just on May 11th, put up a YouTube video.

387
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:38,290
Speaker 0: that's a still black screen, and it just says the words like, you know, the Zelda logo appears.

388
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:41,650
Speaker 0: It could just be a solid white Zelda logo on a black background.

389
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,930
Speaker 0: And then there's a link, there's a purchase, there's a purchase link, right?

390
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,270
Speaker 0: A link to purchase link.

391
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:53,362
Speaker 0: A link to purchase link, and then it says, "Available today, right now.

392
00:25:53,422 --> 00:25:53,823
Speaker 0: Available

393
00:25:53,863 --> 00:25:54,004
Speaker 0: now.".

394
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:58,030
Speaker 0: Right, so there's no ambiguity on that.

395
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,330
Speaker 0: I still think if I- And then anyone who goes to the eShop, it's just like right there at the top, like a full width banner.

396
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,622
Speaker 0: Just like, "Click here for

397
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:05,067
Speaker 0: Zelda.".

398
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:08,710
Speaker 0: No screenshots, no trailers, no nothing.

399
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,423
Speaker 0: Just, "New, Zelda, click

400
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:10,907
Speaker 0: here.".

401
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:18,930
Speaker 0: It's like people who are really, you know, whatever, are gonna wait for a video game news site to buy it and post screenshots and YouTubes.

402
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,809
Speaker 0: And some streamer will stream it right away, and then you'll see it.

403
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,110
Speaker 0: But they don't waste money on any marketing content.

404
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,244
Speaker 0: Just be like, "New Zelda's out

405
00:26:26,264 --> 00:26:26,508
Speaker 0: today.".

406
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:33,070
Speaker 1: I think there's only one company and one major game that ever has a chance of getting that treatment.

407
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:38,570
Speaker 1: If there is ever a Half-Life 3, I feel like that's how they're gonna release it.

408
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,329
Speaker 1: It's just one day is for sale.

409
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,269
Speaker 0: Just like today, guys.

410
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,790
Speaker 0: Just like, bam!

411
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:44,202
Speaker 0: Half-Life 3, out.

412
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:49,429
Speaker 0: If I were the product manager- On the Steam homepage is just the Half-Life logo and a Buy Now button.

413
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:56,770
Speaker 0: If I were a product manager at Valve- Just put an orange lambda in a circle on a black background and an add to my library button.

414
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:02,290
Speaker 1: I would stake my career on launching it like that being the best decision I could ever make.

415
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:04,009
Speaker 1: And I am confident I would be right.

416
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,701
Speaker 0: You don't gotta do nothing.

417
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:06,508
Speaker 0: You don't gotta hype it.

418
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:11,510
Speaker 0: The hardest part would be keeping the Valve employees from spilling the beans ahead of time.

419
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,070
Speaker 1: I mean, they all get buried with the first production disc in the tomb.

420
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:24,828
Speaker 0: Thankfully, they've cried wolf so much, or at least reverse wolf cried, that even if Valve employees come out, they're like, "Half-Life 3 is coming,

421
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:25,230
Speaker 0: everybody!".

422
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,207
Speaker 0: People are like, "Tell me another

423
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:28,468
Speaker 0: one.".

424
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,658
Speaker 0: It's like, "I work at Valve.

425
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,163
Speaker 0: Sure you

426
00:27:30,203 --> 00:27:30,284
Speaker 0: do.".

427
00:27:32,695 --> 00:27:34,010
Speaker 1: And there's a few other things.

428
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:37,130
Speaker 1: Looks like there's a Harvest Moon remake coming.

429
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:44,690
Speaker 0: There are a lot of farming games getting remade or new farming games coming, which tells me farming games must be making a lot of money.

430
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:45,870
Speaker 0: People keep making them.

431
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:51,229
Speaker 1: The Turbo Nerds, Fast Karate, if it was still producing podcasts, would be excited about this.

432
00:27:52,770 --> 00:28:00,549
Speaker 1: The Fatal Frame that came out in Japan only on the Wii in the late 2000s is apparently coming out on the Switch in the US.

433
00:28:01,371 --> 00:28:05,450
Speaker 0: They are doing a good job of getting the old missing Japanese titles out in the US.

434
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:20,750
Speaker 0: Ever since, I think what must have happened is that the Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 2, 3, whatever, must have sold so that everyone caught on to that.

435
00:28:22,051 --> 00:28:24,770
Speaker 1: And there's some other announcements, but honestly, we don't really play those kinds of games.

436
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,250
Speaker 1: And if you play those games, you already know about these announcements.

437
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:30,290
Speaker 1: Just go read a website to find out everything Nintendo announced.

438
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,370
Speaker 1: I will say, though, I'm a tiny geek by now that I have played a bunch more of Cult of the Lamb.

439
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:43,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is just sloppy Hades, Binding of Isaac Melee.

440
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:44,742
Speaker 1: That is 90% of the gameplay.

441
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,590
Speaker 1: Decide if that's what you want or not, if you are not already playing that game.

442
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:53,770
Speaker 0: So if you're looking for more Animal Crossing, you should not buy Cult of the Lamb?

443
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:54,662
Speaker 0: I would not.

444
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:55,169
Speaker 1: It is not.

445
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:55,970
Speaker 0: Some other game?

446
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,810
Speaker 1: Most of the gameplay is sloppy.

447
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:05,710
Speaker 1: Take a sloppy port of Hades and mash it into the Binding of Isaac engine, or what feels like the Binding of Isaac engine.

448
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:08,110
Speaker 1: That is the majority of the actual gameplay.

449
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,410
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess two more.

450
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,861
Speaker 0: There's the new Fire Emblem, and all the Fire Emblem.

451
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,430
Speaker 0: people are, you know, raveling.

452
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:16,270
Speaker 0: And I just haven't played a Fire Emblem in forever.

453
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:19,290
Speaker 1: I can't tell if they're happy or mad about the new Fire Emblem.

454
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:21,902
Speaker 0: There's so much mixed ravel.

455
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:23,470
Speaker 0: I can't tell what's going on in that scene.

456
00:29:23,852 --> 00:29:26,910
Speaker 0: And then, lastly, The Fist of the North Star.

457
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,756
Speaker 0: Oh, right!

458
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:29,050
Speaker 1: I almost forgot to talk about that.

459
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:35,250
Speaker 0: It's not exactly the game that we played in the arcade with the six punching bags.

460
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,510
Speaker 1: Because that game requires a full arcade machine with six physical things to punch.

461
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,850
Speaker 0: It's effectively that game is coming out for the Switch.

462
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:44,888
Speaker 0: I might buy that.

463
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,620
Speaker 1: Oh, I will absolutely buy that.

464
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,030
Speaker 1: We're doing a fucking show on that.

465
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,030
Speaker 1: That's gonna be great.

466
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:51,108
Speaker 1: Or it's gonna be bad.

467
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:52,770
Speaker 0: That's not a game I can buy on PC either.

468
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:54,849
Speaker 1: I am absolutely getting that game.

469
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:03,020
Speaker 1: But, anyway, things of the day.

470
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:13,140
Speaker 1: It is, despite the fact that it's like 85 degrees and humid outside, and it sounds like I saw rumblings that there's gonna be a New York heatwave, like, in October is predicted.

471
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:14,108
Speaker 0: Oh, good.

472
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,660
Speaker 0: I can go biking.

473
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,212
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

474
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:23,360
Speaker 1: But, because it's September, we have technically entered spooky season as far as I'm concerned.

475
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,980
Speaker 0: We already bought some Halloween decorations at the dollar store.

476
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,424
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

477
00:30:26,464 --> 00:30:28,020
Speaker 1: It is already over the garden wall season.

478
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:41,350
Speaker 1: So, my thing of the day is this is one of many channels that just gives you, like, one to two hour long compilations of music of a genre on YouTube of various provenance.

479
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:50,140
Speaker 1: And this one is specifically an hour and a half of electro swing, nicely mixed together into an experience, my kind of jam.

480
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:55,300
Speaker 1: But, it is specifically spooky electro swing.

481
00:30:56,401 --> 00:31:00,840
Speaker 1: And, if you're a spookies fan or an electro swing fan, I think you will actually enjoy it.

482
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,520
Speaker 1: I picked the 2021 one because it was a particularly good one.

483
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,512
Speaker 1: It was much better than the 2021 from this channel.

484
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:10,540
Speaker 1: So, what do you got?

485
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:10,941
Speaker 0: All right.

486
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:15,480
Speaker 0: So, recently, I did a thing of the day from a YouTube channel called Karen Puzzles.

487
00:31:15,721 --> 00:31:23,400
Speaker 0: And Karen, the jigsaw puzzle YouTuber, bought a 24,000 piece puzzle and spent six YouTube videos putting it together.

488
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:32,540
Speaker 0: Now, normally, I would never use the same YouTube channel again for another thing of the day, especially not so soon after already featuring that YouTube channel as a thing of the day.

489
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:42,100
Speaker 0: But, Karen managed to succeed at making an exception for themselves, and they did a video so different from their other videos, right?

490
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:55,138
Speaker 0: And, what they did is there was a live stream of the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championships, and they commentated it from their home on their own and edited that commentary together into two videos, right?

491
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:11,340
Speaker 0: And, uploaded those two videos so you can experience spectating the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championships in a lot less than the many, many hours that it takes to watch the actual live stream, right?

492
00:32:12,204 --> 00:32:14,835
Speaker 0: And, I learned a lot about the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship.

493
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:15,840
Speaker 0: We may talk about it.

494
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,420
Speaker 0: I think we're going to do a jigsaw puzzle episode eventually.

495
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,299
Speaker 1: We spent like 20 minutes talking about this before we did the show.

496
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:25,265
Speaker 0: Yeah.

497
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:34,880
Speaker 0: But, what I can say is that competition game-wise, the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship, it has room for improvement, but it's actually not too bad, right?

498
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,467
Speaker 0: It's a decent, competitive structure.

499
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:41,760
Speaker 0: It looked like it had a friendly, high-quality environment.

500
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:49,754
Speaker 0: And, I would be willing to go to it if it wasn't in Spain, and not because I don't want to go to Spain, because I don't want to go to Spain now.

501
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:52,379
Speaker 1: That's fair.

502
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,739
Speaker 0: I would love to go to Spain.

503
00:32:55,901 --> 00:33:01,060
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Nuts Book Club book, which I guess we'll do in October, because this is the last Geek Nuts for a while.

504
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,151
Speaker 0: I have read, right?

505
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:03,019
Speaker 1: Well, go on.

506
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:04,908
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a short book.

507
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:05,672
Speaker 1: Scott has read it.

508
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:06,656
Speaker 1: I have read it.

509
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:07,480
Speaker 1: It is great.

510
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:14,960
Speaker 1: Just don't have time to do a show on it, because Geek Nuts is going to be on a three-fucking-week hiatus.

511
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,979
Speaker 0: Thursday night, I'm going to- The book is what?

512
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:18,931
Speaker 1: Binti.

513
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,340
Speaker 0: Alright, so I just want to clarify that you have chosen only the first book as your book club book?

514
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:24,938
Speaker 0: You read all three?

515
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:26,398
Speaker 0: I read all three.

516
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:27,578
Speaker 1: I'll read the other two.

517
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,980
Speaker 0: They were, like, people said these were short.

518
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:33,339
Speaker 1: I told you, one setting for both had most.

519
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:38,360
Speaker 0: Each one of them took me maybe an hour, so it's like three hours for the whole trilogy.

520
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:40,468
Speaker 0: I feel like we got a retcon.

521
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,320
Speaker 0: How many people are really reading it anyway, right?

522
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,120
Speaker 0: I feel like you got to retcon and make the trilogy the book club book.

523
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:45,929
Speaker 1: I think I can do that.

524
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,880
Speaker 1: We can talk about all three.

525
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,005
Speaker 0: It's your book club book.

526
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:50,359
Speaker 0: I can't force that upon you, but you know.

527
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:52,040
Speaker 1: I think I will do it.

528
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,920
Speaker 0: It takes three hours, maybe three to four hours to read all three.

529
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:07,780
Speaker 1: Well, especially because we were extending the deadline, because like I said, the big meta news is where I'm going to be biking 500 miles from our apartment to Emily's parents' house way upstate, like an hour away from Buffalo.

530
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,556
Speaker 0: Not in one shot, though.

531
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,659
Speaker 1: Over the course of seven days, starting Friday when the sun comes up.

532
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,045
Speaker 0: Very reasonable.

533
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:15,791
Speaker 0: Not in one day.

534
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,800
Speaker 1: No, I would die.

535
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,931
Speaker 1: We're doing 100 miles the first day, and every day after.

536
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:23,900
Speaker 1: that is way easier than the first day.

537
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:32,820
Speaker 0: There was a guy I met at a family function who might, you know, he might be old man Scott.

538
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,190
Speaker 0: He has like a Mets tattoo.

539
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:37,340
Speaker 0: He's like an old biking man.

540
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:43,420
Speaker 0: But he said that he biked a length of New Jersey 200 miles in one shot.

541
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,378
Speaker 0: And I'm like, all right, he's more biking than I am.

542
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:46,446
Speaker 0: Yeah.

543
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:48,018
Speaker 1: And he's way older than I am.

544
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,000
Speaker 1: I can reliably bike 80 miles with zero discomfort whatsoever.

545
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,873
Speaker 1: I'm just living my best life the whole time, averaging like 12 to 15 miles an hour.

546
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,059
Speaker 0: Depends on the terrain.

547
00:34:58,762 --> 00:34:58,924
Speaker 1: Yep.

548
00:34:58,964 --> 00:34:59,711
Speaker 1: I mean, not 80 miles.

549
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,017
Speaker 0: Depends on how many people I got with me.

550
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:02,575
Speaker 1: Yep.

551
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:03,620
Speaker 0: Depends on the weather.

552
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:10,160
Speaker 1: But 100 miles, usually the last 10 or 20 miles are still type two fun.

553
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,798
Speaker 1: Like it's fun, but it's not as fun as the first 80 miles.

554
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,360
Speaker 1: Like that is when Rims old man body starts to say, you need a break before you do another 100 miles, buddy.

555
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:20,679
Speaker 1: So this should be a good time.

556
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,620
Speaker 1: And then I am immediately flying to London for a week for a work trip.

557
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,680
Speaker 1: And then I'm flying to Frankfurt for a week for a work trip.

558
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,197
Speaker 1: So I ain't going to be back in the United States or back to do geek nights until like the week of October 10th.

559
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:38,160
Speaker 0: No royal shit is going to interfere with your plans?

560
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:48,189
Speaker 1: Actually, the royal shit has fucked up a bunch of other people's plans because there's now an ad hoc holiday on like the Monday, I guess, that a bunch of people are traveling for some stuff.

561
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:51,640
Speaker 1: that's semi-related to why I'm going there, but that doesn't affect me.

562
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,356
Speaker 1: But I booked my trip looking at the US calendar and the London calendar.

563
00:35:57,396 --> 00:35:58,580
Speaker 1: I didn't look at the German calendar.

564
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,839
Speaker 1: So I'm going to be in London for a week and then I fly to Frankfurt for a week.

565
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:06,760
Speaker 1: But there's a German holiday and our office is closed on that Monday.

566
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,600
Speaker 1: So I hope no co-workers are listening to this.

567
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,680
Speaker 1: I'm just going to hang out in Frankfurt on Monday and I get a vacation.

568
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,212
Speaker 0: Wait, I'm looking at my actual calendar.

569
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:20,780
Speaker 0: Is this an Oktoberfest related holiday?

570
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:23,264
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens.

571
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:27,380
Speaker 1: We'll see what photos I post to Twitter in Frankfurt.

572
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:29,451
Speaker 0: Many pretzel emojis appearing.

573
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:30,478
Speaker 0: Pretzel sausage emojis.

574
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:41,580
Speaker 1: What I'll say is the one thing to know if you go to Germany, especially if you were in Bavaria, because I fucked this up the first time I went to Munich.

575
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:48,780
Speaker 1: If you go to a restaurant and they just bring out a bunch of bread or a bunch of pretzels, don't fucking eat them.

576
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,971
Speaker 1: They're like a euro each.

577
00:36:51,535 --> 00:36:52,360
Speaker 1: They are not free.

578
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:52,837
Speaker 0: I'd eat one.

579
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, they will not.

580
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,440
Speaker 1: At least know that they are not free when they bring you those pretzels.

581
00:36:57,741 --> 00:36:59,894
Speaker 1: They are bringing them out and you are not.

582
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:00,779
Speaker 1: Don't eat them all.

583
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,820
Speaker 0: I probably couldn't even eat the whole pretzel anyway, right?

584
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,145
Speaker 0: They were kind of small.

585
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:05,733
Speaker 1: They brought a bread basket.

586
00:37:05,894 --> 00:37:07,020
Speaker 1: I ate the whole bread basket.

587
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:13,158
Speaker 1: The guy came back later and was like, "Yeah, you owe me like 23 euros for that entire fucking basket of bread you

588
00:37:13,238 --> 00:37:13,379
Speaker 1: ate.".

589
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:14,558
Speaker 0: Was it worth it?

590
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:15,720
Speaker 1: Yeah.

591
00:37:18,764 --> 00:37:20,907
Speaker 1: Oh, and last but not least, the panel.

592
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:27,660
Speaker 1: I promise there was a new version of that losing panel and it was a radically redone version of that panel.

593
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:29,300
Speaker 1: It is a completely different talk.

594
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,440
Speaker 0: I haven't watched it, so I can't say it, but I wager that it's not.

595
00:37:33,881 --> 00:37:40,720
Speaker 1: It actually is because the original panel, the first half was single player games, the second half was multiplayer games.

596
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,199
Speaker 1: Barely talked about role playing games.

597
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,540
Speaker 1: This one, the first half is a rewritten single player games.

598
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:47,500
Speaker 1: The second half is tabletop RPGs.

599
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,720
Speaker 1: We don't talk about multiplayer at all and I tell everyone to go watch the other video, but I'm not going to change anything.

600
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,446
Speaker 1: That video is perfect.

601
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:55,800
Speaker 1: where we talked about multiplayer games.

602
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,726
Speaker 1: Losing is on YouTube in its entirety.

603
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:05,800
Speaker 1: Me and Emily doing the panel with a link to all the slides and every reference we made.

604
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,399
Speaker 1: All the other panels and videos we talked about are all just there.

605
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,302
Speaker 1: Go watch it.

606
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:10,065
Speaker 1: It was a really good time.

607
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:13,400
Speaker 1: We had a good audience and we ended with five minutes to spare.

608
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,700
Speaker 1: We took a question from the audience and I followed my rule.

609
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:35,680
Speaker 1: I called on the first non-male, non-white appearing person who raised their hand and not only did they ask a fantastic question, but they are already a Geek Nights fan and they came to the panel specifically because they wanted to ask us this question that was relevant to this panel at a previous panel we did at PAX West before COVID.

610
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:40,180
Speaker 0: I guess I'll go and skip to the end and listen to this question.

611
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,560
Speaker 0: That was a pretty good question.

612
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,260
Speaker 0: That has been cheesed.

613
00:38:43,185 --> 00:38:44,080
Speaker 0: A cheesed question.

614
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:51,800
Speaker 1: Listener, I did not catch your name and because of COVID protocols, the enforcers of course shooed almost everyone out of the room so we couldn't interact too much.

615
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,569
Speaker 1: So if you're listening to this, email us.

616
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,860
Speaker 1: I will happily answer your question in more detail via email.

617
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,079
Speaker 0: Okay, we can finally get to the main bit.

618
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:03,520
Speaker 1: Finally get to the main bit.

619
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:16,239
Speaker 1: This is something that I spent a lot of time thinking about in middle school and high school because you kids don't realize what it was like to try to play games.

620
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:23,900
Speaker 1: In this case, we're pretty much only talking about PC games, like multiplayer PC games for the most part.

621
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:40,600
Speaker 1: If you wanted to play Quake or Doom or any one of those games like Command & Conquer against someone else, you had to know like the phone number of a special service to dial, the actual direct IP address of a specific server that someone was running.

622
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:41,912
Speaker 1: How were they running it?

623
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:42,540
Speaker 1: Magic.

624
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:46,360
Speaker 1: I didn't know how to run a server until like late high school.

625
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:53,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, the way that I played multiplayer PC games was of course local, right?

626
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,375
Speaker 0: Whether you're sitting at the same computer with two input devices or a LAN.

627
00:39:59,221 --> 00:40:04,620
Speaker 0: All the computers are just plugged into the same hub and you connect that way using IPX or something.

628
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:07,488
Speaker 0: And then you've got the dial up.

629
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:10,260
Speaker 0: One person opens up their modem, the other person dials the modem.

630
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,414
Speaker 0: You call it, you're effectively just making a phone call and then playing.

631
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:14,640
Speaker 0: I've done that method.

632
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:19,718
Speaker 0: But yeah, because, you know, we don't have IPv6 really, right?

633
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,394
Speaker 0: It's like you could, you know, go to like open up Half-Life back in the 90s or early 2000s and be like click new game.

634
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:31,760
Speaker 0: And then that would sort of create a server and run the game locally.

635
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:36,239
Speaker 0: And then someone else could try to find your game either in the game list or typing in your IP.

636
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:42,820
Speaker 1: Good luck actually making that work the way people's houses and internet actually worked at the time.

637
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:52,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially so your computer, even if you could get the networking part to work, your computer had to run the server and the game for you, the client for you at the same time.

638
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,779
Speaker 0: So you needed a very powerful computer for this to be a good experience.

639
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,620
Speaker 0: Oh my god, remember in RIT?

640
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,280
Speaker 0: Especially if there were more than just a few players, right?

641
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:11,100
Speaker 1: Remember in RIT when we were playing Ricochet locally with IPX and our neighbors like bullshit firewall detected it and they called campus safety on us claiming we were hacking them?

642
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:12,281
Speaker 0: Yeah.

643
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:20,220
Speaker 0: Anyway, so what happened is you basically had to just run a game server.

644
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:27,440
Speaker 0: You would get a computer that was dedicated to doing nothing else, but running the game server, the computer would have a publicly accessible IP address.

645
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:30,599
Speaker 0: And now everybody who wanted to play could connect to the server.

646
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:33,060
Speaker 0: Their local computer would only have to run the client.

647
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:43,160
Speaker 0: And as long as your network connection to the server was solid and low latency enough, 100 or less usually, hopefully even less than that, maybe less than 50 if you're really good.

648
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,439
Speaker 0: A single digit if you're in college, right?

649
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:48,618
Speaker 1: A single digit for me in high school for reasons I'll get into.

650
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:57,538
Speaker 0: But anyway, then multiplayer PC gaming became a good, decent experience in the early 2000s, late 90s.

651
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:00,260
Speaker 1: Now it was a fascinating time.

652
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:07,560
Speaker 1: I think we'll start by talking about what it was like to be a player and then we can talk about what it was like and the challenges of actually running a server.

653
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:10,460
Speaker 1: And then what sort of killed this and what the current state of things are.

654
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:15,920
Speaker 1: Because those are the three main interesting topics here that don't overlap other Geek Nights episodes we've already done.

655
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:22,260
Speaker 1: As a player, you got to understand, this was already a rarefied experience.

656
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:36,900
Speaker 1: The tiniest percentage of people who even had access to a computer that could play a game like Quake had the ability, knowledge, and community to play it online with significant numbers of other people.

657
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:40,280
Speaker 1: That was already very rare for most people.

658
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:46,000
Speaker 0: It might be common if you go to, say, a nerdy college, everyone's playing Counter-Strike in every room.

659
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,940
Speaker 0: But worldwide, almost nobody.

660
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,660
Speaker 1: And even most college kids, when we were in high school, not a lot of colleges even had this stuff set up.

661
00:42:56,609 --> 00:42:57,399
Speaker 0: Only the nerdy ones.

662
00:42:57,861 --> 00:43:01,820
Speaker 1: RIT was notable in that it had a, for real, campus network that worked.

663
00:43:02,561 --> 00:43:06,100
Speaker 0: And even if the college wasn't nerdy, there might be a nerdy section of the college.

664
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,793
Speaker 0: Like just the people in the CS department, but no one else.

665
00:43:08,974 --> 00:43:10,200
Speaker 0: The whole rest of the college wasn't in it.

666
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,540
Speaker 1: So in high school, like skipping modems, because that's a little dicey.

667
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,560
Speaker 1: If I wanted to play Quake online on a server.

668
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:22,420
Speaker 1: One, I had to know a community of people online who lived pretty close to me.

669
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,300
Speaker 1: Like they had to live in Southeast Michigan or it wouldn't work.

670
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,939
Speaker 1: Internet was a lot slower back then.

671
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,240
Speaker 1: Like so much slower and so much higher latency.

672
00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:32,960
Speaker 1: Whatever you think it was like, you were wrong.

673
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:34,359
Speaker 1: Unless you were as old as us or older.

674
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:42,760
Speaker 1: So I had to just somehow know like a bunch of people who lived in Southeast Michigan who all played Quake.

675
00:43:43,403 --> 00:43:44,700
Speaker 1: All had similar sensibilities.

676
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:55,140
Speaker 1: And knew someone in our collective circles who had the arcane knowledge to run a public Quake server with a real IP address.

677
00:43:55,742 --> 00:44:00,800
Speaker 1: So it was some rich white kid usually running a server on like dedicated hardware.

678
00:44:01,423 --> 00:44:05,600
Speaker 1: And the local community of people playing one specific game.

679
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:11,920
Speaker 1: And only that game would find each other on BBS's and web-based forums and bulletin boards.

680
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:18,020
Speaker 1: I spent a lot of time in IRC just watching for is anyone playing Quake?

681
00:44:18,361 --> 00:44:25,840
Speaker 1: Because if anyone I know is playing Quake, they would post in IRC the IP address or often just the name of the server they were on.

682
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,720
Speaker 1: Because some of the servers were kind of exclusive.

683
00:44:29,261 --> 00:44:35,160
Speaker 1: Like Bunnies was a place I would play where it was only chill cool people and people tried to win.

684
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:41,021
Speaker 1: And it had like a 20 millisecond ping even in 1997.

685
00:44:41,021 --> 00:44:46,420
Speaker 0: And the thing is, you know, not all of the servers, right?

686
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,580
Speaker 0: It's not like today where you can just get a server list, right?

687
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,215
Speaker 0: It's like, ah, here are all the Quake servers, right?

688
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:53,000
Speaker 0: Let me choose one.

689
00:44:53,241 --> 00:44:55,900
Speaker 0: It's like back in those days, there wasn't a server list.

690
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:57,458
Speaker 0: It was type in the IP here.

691
00:44:58,301 --> 00:45:01,840
Speaker 0: There might have been some other software that was separate that you could use.

692
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:08,880
Speaker 0: It might list servers, but people had to add their servers to those lists on purpose, right?

693
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:17,200
Speaker 0: If someone wasn't advertising to the world that they have a server at an IP address, finding it was going to be very, very difficult.

694
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:23,440
Speaker 1: But even worse, the more well known the IP address was of a server, the more dipshits were there.

695
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,920
Speaker 1: And the more popular it was, you try to log in, it's full.

696
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:32,020
Speaker 1: I spent a lot of time, literally, I would just sit there at my computer, like looking at the internet.

697
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:38,160
Speaker 1: Well, I had Quake open constantly trying to connect to the IP address of a good server because it was full.

698
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,212
Speaker 0: Because as soon as someone quits, there's a spot open.

699
00:45:41,232 --> 00:45:43,280
Speaker 0: It's first come, first served digitally.

700
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,959
Speaker 0: If you can get that spot, you're in.

701
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:48,834
Speaker 1: And generally, if the server was full, that's a hopping server.

702
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:50,260
Speaker 1: You definitely want to be there.

703
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:52,240
Speaker 1: If a server lets you in right away, it's usually empty.

704
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:59,940
Speaker 0: Sure, you could join a server that's got two people playing and hope that maybe there's a lot of people who are currently refreshing and trying to join the full server.

705
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:04,379
Speaker 0: And if they see the server with two people go to three and four, they might go to that one.

706
00:46:05,121 --> 00:46:06,900
Speaker 0: And this only works, though, when there's a server listing.

707
00:46:08,486 --> 00:46:10,364
Speaker 0: But the more public servers... Sometimes it doesn't happen.

708
00:46:10,384 --> 00:46:13,560
Speaker 0: Sometimes you go to the server with two people and no one comes and it's like, god damn it.

709
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:19,400
Speaker 1: So there were a bunch of Quake 1 and Quake 2 servers running various mods and some of them were vanilla in my area.

710
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:27,080
Speaker 1: But most of them, there were people there, but they were bad people, they were griefers and trolls and cheaters and all this crap.

711
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:36,640
Speaker 1: So separately, there was a list of servers that I knew about and the people I knew knew about from private IRC that weren't listed on all those websites.

712
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:39,719
Speaker 1: And those were the cool places where chill people would hang out.

713
00:46:41,661 --> 00:46:46,620
Speaker 0: But it was harder for those ones to have enough people to be playing.

714
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,599
Speaker 0: It was more rare that you would go there and actually get a good game going on.

715
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,400
Speaker 0: Because it's not open to the public with lots of players coming all the time.

716
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:53,962
Speaker 0: Except Bunnies.

717
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:58,880
Speaker 1: Bunnies was pretty much full 24/7 because that was the best server in Southeast Michigan.

718
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:02,952
Speaker 1: And you had to... Bunny had to talk to you to vet.

719
00:47:02,992 --> 00:47:05,159
Speaker 1: you were a chill person before they'd even tell you the IP.

720
00:47:06,081 --> 00:47:10,840
Speaker 1: And I was password protected and that was where I spent a lot of time playing Quake games back in the day.

721
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:18,194
Speaker 1: But you were 100% at the mercy of whoever out there ran the server.

722
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:21,140
Speaker 1: They were the dictator god as far as you were concerned.

723
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,700
Speaker 0: Yep, and the person running the server can do all sorts of nonsense.

724
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,340
Speaker 0: They can kick you, they can ban you, at least ban your IP based on what system it was.

725
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,631
Speaker 0: When Steam came around, they could ban your Steam ID.

726
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:33,360
Speaker 0: You need to get a whole new Steam account.

727
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:36,049
Speaker 0: They could change the rules on the server.

728
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,215
Speaker 0: They could change the gravity.

729
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:38,160
Speaker 0: They could change the map.

730
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,369
Speaker 0: They could change fucking anything.

731
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:42,600
Speaker 0: Anything that was a Quake variable, right?

732
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,380
Speaker 1: I had three different versions of Weapons Factory, a mod for Quake 2 installed.

733
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,800
Speaker 1: Because all the different servers I connected to were all running different versions of the mod that were mutually incompatible.

734
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, they could cheat.

735
00:47:55,354 --> 00:47:56,500
Speaker 0: They could do whatever the hell they wanted.

736
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,510
Speaker 0: They ran the server.

737
00:47:57,732 --> 00:47:58,460
Speaker 0: They were in charge.

738
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,950
Speaker 0: The people who made the game have no say.

739
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,360
Speaker 0: The people playing the game have no say.

740
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:07,260
Speaker 0: The person running the server is like a GM in old school D&D where they just do whatever they want.

741
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,048
Speaker 0: And that was, in some ways, good.

742
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:11,720
Speaker 0: And in some ways, not good.

743
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,399
Speaker 1: Yep, like you talk about today, like, "Oh, without matchmaking, gaming

744
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:15,520
Speaker 1: sucks.".

745
00:48:16,442 --> 00:48:19,100
Speaker 1: This is so far beyond without matchmaking.

746
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:20,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, right?

747
00:48:22,022 --> 00:48:22,907
Speaker 1: And I had a lot of fun.

748
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:25,180
Speaker 1: And it was a really interesting time.

749
00:48:25,581 --> 00:48:27,653
Speaker 1: But those days also sucked.

750
00:48:27,894 --> 00:48:36,099
Speaker 1: They were a giant pain in the... I had a notepad file that was the list of, like, the specific servers I could play each game I cared about on.

751
00:48:36,921 --> 00:48:37,333
Speaker 1: And that was it.

752
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:38,602
Speaker 0: Yep.

753
00:48:39,707 --> 00:48:42,940
Speaker 0: So, as time went on, right, things progressed a bit, right?

754
00:48:43,161 --> 00:48:45,699
Speaker 0: The "run your own server" got a little bit easier.

755
00:48:48,203 --> 00:48:50,759
Speaker 0: Some normal people could do it or just pay someone else to do it.

756
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,020
Speaker 1: Freshman year of RIT, I ran a Counter-Strike server, a really crappy one, from my dorm room.

757
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,618
Speaker 1: And then Scott and I ran a much better one from our colony apartment.

758
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,980
Speaker 0: When I bought a new computer, the old computer ran the IcyWorld server.

759
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,233
Speaker 0: Yep, we ran an FYI.

760
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:11,400
Speaker 0: It wasn't a strong enough computer to run, like, Dust 2 or whatever, but IcyWorld is a tiny map, so it worked.

761
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:11,740
Speaker 1: Yep.

762
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,695
Speaker 1: We limited it to, what, like eight or ten players, I think.

763
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:15,720
Speaker 1: Otherwise it would lay out.

764
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, IcyWorld doesn't need that many players, right?

765
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:17,798
Speaker 0: Exactly.

766
00:49:18,802 --> 00:49:19,679
Speaker 0: Per team, per team.

767
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:23,940
Speaker 1: I spent a lot of time playing on our dumpy little IcyWorld server at RIT.

768
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:24,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too.

769
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:27,499
Speaker 1: What I was very happy about is, it was always bumping.

770
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:29,932
Speaker 1: There were always people there, even if we weren't using it.

771
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,119
Speaker 1: I was very happy about that.

772
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:35,520
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah, running your own server got easier.

773
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,580
Speaker 0: There was the server listings that were run by the game developers, right, so it's easy to find games.

774
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,360
Speaker 0: You know, the anti-cheat technology came into play.

775
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,320
Speaker 0: There was already, like, existing anti-cheat, like Punkbuster, if anyone remembers that.

776
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:54,640
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I was not cool with Punkbuster until people were cheating so much.

777
00:49:55,023 --> 00:49:56,940
Speaker 1: That I was willing to accept that malware.

778
00:49:57,741 --> 00:50:04,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, then Valve came out with that VAC, right, which was much better, but not perfect anti-cheat, right?

779
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,580
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know, it was okay times, right?

780
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:14,740
Speaker 0: It was, they eliminated some of the problems of the old day, but you still had the fundamental same situation, right?

781
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,720
Speaker 0: Where a server is run by a person, that person is in charge.

782
00:50:19,261 --> 00:50:26,900
Speaker 0: Every, you know, there aren't really, some of the games, their company might run a few servers of their own, just to create, like, a baseline.

783
00:50:27,422 --> 00:50:30,440
Speaker 0: But people rarely played on those very much, right?

784
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:36,780
Speaker 1: And the cool part about that era, all those eras, was in the early days, they were just dictators.

785
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:49,220
Speaker 1: But that brief period where the ease of running a server expanded, we saw a lot of servers where people set up really fun and clever stuff.

786
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:56,400
Speaker 1: That sort of threw gasoline on the existing mod scene, and people were doing really interesting things.

787
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:04,580
Speaker 1: Some servers would have completely different rulesets, like, people were experimenting, whole communities would, like, form around weird servers.

788
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:09,340
Speaker 1: It was, honestly, a really fun time to be alive in terms of gaming, because you gotta wait for the-.

789
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, not all of those mods and customizations were, like, good as games.

790
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,780
Speaker 1: Oh, most of them were absolute dogshit, don't get us wrong.

791
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,740
Speaker 0: Right, but it was still, like, a flourishing period of creativity and excitement and all sorts of, you know, there were lots of options.

792
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:28,120
Speaker 0: And you'd be surprised, like, what random Half-Life mod you could turn on and actually find players, right?

793
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,567
Speaker 0: It's like, Natural Selection.

794
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:31,235
Speaker 0: 1 was a Half-Life 1 mod.

795
00:51:31,476 --> 00:51:32,180
Speaker 0: That's what it was.

796
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:40,020
Speaker 0: It wasn't a new game, you know, it's like, it was a Half-Life 1 mod, and if it wasn't for the ability to run your own server, it's like, it wouldn't have been possible.

797
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:41,639
Speaker 0: It never happened.

798
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:52,780
Speaker 1: So, it went from an era of a very small number of nerds with money and arcane knowledge could run these, to almost any nerd who cared could run this, like, it was pretty easy.

799
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:56,850
Speaker 1: But then, the server world, like, kind of went away.

800
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:00,920
Speaker 1: Like, in the modern era, very few people run their own servers.

801
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:10,060
Speaker 1: They're almost entirely reliant on the company that released the game will let people spawn games, but not necessarily dedicated servers.

802
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:12,487
Speaker 1: A lot of these companies will let you customize.

803
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:16,940
Speaker 1: Some games let you customize to extreme extents, like Overwatch.

804
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:22,139
Speaker 1: If you spawn a custom game, you can put some ridiculous mods in there.

805
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,460
Speaker 0: Right, but you can't make up your own mod, you can just choose from the mods that they're providing.

806
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,999
Speaker 0: It could be an extensive list.

807
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,760
Speaker 1: But you can also tune every parameter, you can import objects, there's a lot of customization.

808
00:52:32,821 --> 00:52:33,911
Speaker 0: You can't write code, though.

809
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:34,759
Speaker 0: There's a line.

810
00:52:35,923 --> 00:52:39,320
Speaker 1: You can get close to writing code with some of the modding capabilities.

811
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,979
Speaker 0: You couldn't make something like Natural Selection 1 Overwatch.

812
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,546
Speaker 0: You could not.

813
00:52:42,213 --> 00:52:42,779
Speaker 0: Absolutely not.

814
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,448
Speaker 0: You could make another game.

815
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:44,240
Speaker 0: that's not Overwatch.

816
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:47,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if we just focus on the server aspect of it...

817
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,658
Speaker 0: You couldn't add some character that didn't exist.

818
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:58,280
Speaker 1: I don't think the fact that companies went this way is what killed people running their own dedicated servers.

819
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:07,680
Speaker 1: What killed it is the fact that the fatal flaw of all dedicated servers was that without matchmaking, you had to do manual matchmaking.

820
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:17,280
Speaker 1: Unless you played on servers where the people who played were all roughly your same skill level, gaming sucked.

821
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,080
Speaker 1: You were either better than everyone else or you died instantly every game no matter what.

822
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,407
Speaker 1: And that was it.

823
00:53:22,508 --> 00:53:23,500
Speaker 1: There was zero middle ground.

824
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:31,420
Speaker 0: Because a lot of these games were skill-based, high skill cap games, if there were other games... That's also a consequence of the game itself.

825
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:36,360
Speaker 0: If you had been playing with a server of some other game that wasn't a high skill game, that wouldn't have happened.

826
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:40,659
Speaker 0: But you were playing Counter-Strike or Quake, so that was definitely what was going on.

827
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:47,920
Speaker 1: But most games that had dedicated server technology were competitive first person shooter ortho games.

828
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:48,424
Speaker 0: Of course.

829
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:49,318
Speaker 0: Of course.

830
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,518
Speaker 1: Because most other games...

831
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:55,940
Speaker 0: Who's going to go through the effort to do all that for, I don't know, for Candyland?

832
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,500
Speaker 1: And other games like Civilization and stuff like that really didn't have multiplayer capabilities.

833
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,239
Speaker 0: They did play by mail.

834
00:54:03,604 --> 00:54:03,900
Speaker 0: Exactly.

835
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:05,071
Speaker 0: You couldn't even run a server.

836
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:19,560
Speaker 1: FPSs really were the emergence of that concept for most people of run a dedicated server, curate a community around it, and that is the place you play this game with your friends and your extended community.

837
00:54:20,241 --> 00:54:22,039
Speaker 1: Nowadays, you do that via friends lists.

838
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,760
Speaker 0: So companies started running the servers themselves, and this had some pluses and minuses.

839
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:27,522
Speaker 0: We already talked about.

840
00:54:27,622 --> 00:54:31,800
Speaker 0: one minus is the lack of the flourishing creativity of the mods and all that.

841
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:32,858
Speaker 0: But here's the plus.

842
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:34,190
Speaker 1: Quake 1 today, we want to play.

843
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,840
Speaker 1: I right click on all my friends' names in Quake.

844
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,298
Speaker 0: And it works.

845
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,299
Speaker 1: It just works.

846
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,480
Speaker 1: A server appears, my friends are in it.

847
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:42,820
Speaker 0: It works great.

848
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,878
Speaker 1: Nobody else is in it.

849
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,675
Speaker 1: Everyone has the same version.

850
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,336
Speaker 0: No one has to go and update their...

851
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:47,936
Speaker 1: Yup.

852
00:54:48,442 --> 00:54:48,920
Speaker 1: I make it public.

853
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,297
Speaker 0: No one gets a message like, "Oh, the server's got a newer version than you do, or an older

854
00:54:52,337 --> 00:54:52,679
Speaker 0: version.".

855
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,220
Speaker 1: Random people do just join and play with us, and it's totally fun.

856
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:02,940
Speaker 0: Some of those games, you still can get your own maps in there, right?

857
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:03,719
Speaker 0: To an extent.

858
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:04,110
Speaker 0: Yup.

859
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,355
Speaker 0: Things like that.

860
00:55:06,602 --> 00:55:08,979
Speaker 0: But the other players have to have the maps for it to work.

861
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:23,860
Speaker 1: But I guess it's a nuanced space, because it is true that we have lost some of the power and control and modability of servers and the unique aspects of running dedicated servers that you control in these games.

862
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:29,778
Speaker 1: But I think almost all of the pros of the modern era outweigh the cons, because...

863
00:55:30,464 --> 00:55:31,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do outweigh.

864
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,400
Speaker 1: I can't stress this enough.

865
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:42,280
Speaker 1: Without matchmaking, orthogames online that are highly skill-based are absolutely unplayable now that so many more people play games.

866
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:43,335
Speaker 0: Yup.

867
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:49,000
Speaker 0: So some other positives, right, is that cheating has decreased.

868
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,740
Speaker 0: It's still out there, but it's decreased significantly.

869
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:57,220
Speaker 1: You had to find a server where the social contract was, "Nobody cheats," and the mod would actually ban people who cheated.

870
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,740
Speaker 1: That isn't a problem anymore.

871
00:56:00,021 --> 00:56:01,000
Speaker 1: Nobody cheats at Overwatch.

872
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,280
Speaker 1: If someone cheats at Overwatch, they are banned by the company pretty quickly.

873
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,920
Speaker 0: You also don't have to worry too much about the server admin being some jerk, right?

874
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:14,960
Speaker 0: It's like the servers are all adminned by the company, which has the terms of service, right?

875
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:23,493
Speaker 0: It's like if you go to some old Quake server that's run out of someone's house, people there might be going, you know, "Racial slur, racial slur, racial slur,".

876
00:56:23,954 --> 00:56:25,740
Speaker 0: and what are you gonna do about it?

877
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,480
Speaker 0: Report it to who, right?

878
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,240
Speaker 0: It's like the admin who's the one saying racial slur?

879
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,800
Speaker 0: The person who owns that computer?

880
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,299
Speaker 0: It's like, no, right?

881
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:44,940
Speaker 0: But if companies are running them as evil as corporate capitalist entities are, they can actually protect the player base with their terms of service and things of that nature.

882
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:56,820
Speaker 0: And you'll get, you know, it's obviously they haven't completely solved the problem because plenty of people have shitty experiences on their servers all the time, but they can do something about it as opposed to nothing.

883
00:56:58,841 --> 00:57:02,920
Speaker 0: So it's better, you know, even if it's still poopy.

884
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:11,420
Speaker 1: And I think maybe they're like, while there's more we could say, we've gone on over an hour, I'm hungry and I have to play Blades in the Dark like in an hour.

885
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:18,054
Speaker 0: Well, I think the one thing that really needs to be said is the major downside of the not being able to run your own server.

886
00:57:18,254 --> 00:57:20,920
Speaker 0: is the game preservation aspect, right?

887
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:38,159
Speaker 0: All of these multiplayer game experiences, I think this really started with the MMOs and the MUDs, right, is that if the companies running these servers turn their shit off and they don't open source their code or whatever, then you can never experience these games again.

888
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:38,660
Speaker 0: Nobody.

889
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,087
Speaker 0: It's like they're just lost to time permanently.

890
00:57:41,107 --> 00:57:42,130
Speaker 0: They're gone.

891
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:43,475
Speaker 0: There might be screenshots.

892
00:57:44,317 --> 00:57:45,260
Speaker 0: There might be videos.

893
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,250
Speaker 0: There might be some, you know, there might be someone hacks together, like tries to reverse engineer the server or something.

894
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:57,540
Speaker 0: But unless that original server is running, it's a thing that humans can no longer experience.

895
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,889
Speaker 0: Like it is gone, gone the end.

896
00:58:00,753 --> 00:58:02,600
Speaker 0: And that's not cool, right?

897
00:58:03,261 --> 00:58:17,940
Speaker 0: I'm a person who believes that is, you know, if humans are going to survive, right, it's like, what's the point of surviving if we cannot preserve our, you know, a very important note about what you said, though, MMOs did not let players run their own servers ever.

898
00:58:18,921 --> 00:58:19,081
Speaker 0: Nope.

899
00:58:19,582 --> 00:58:21,426
Speaker 1: And in fact, the people who did, they were charging money.

900
00:58:21,467 --> 00:58:21,908
Speaker 0: That's why.

901
00:58:21,928 --> 00:58:22,329
Speaker 0: Yeah.

902
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:27,160
Speaker 1: And FPS is meanwhile, the ones that were well remembered.

903
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:35,860
Speaker 0: Also battle that was really one of the first ones to run their own server with the, you know, the, uh, and the, um, you know, the Diablo.

904
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:43,390
Speaker 1: But like FPS is at least like most FPS is if you have the game, the game usually just includes the ability to host a server.

905
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:46,094
Speaker 1: So the game is preserved in some way.

906
00:58:46,515 --> 00:58:50,280
Speaker 0: What's not preserved are the reason that we can play quick online today.

907
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:57,496
Speaker 0: But there isn't really, you know, other games that had servers, you know, there isn't a tribes to remake on steam, right?

908
00:58:57,716 --> 00:58:58,939
Speaker 0: Because no one can run that server.

909
00:58:58,979 --> 00:58:59,340
Speaker 0: That's why.

910
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,140
Speaker 1: Exactly.

911
00:59:01,342 --> 00:59:11,660
Speaker 1: Uh, but one thing that I don't, I want to disavow you all of is the idea that a lot was lost in the individual servers that disappeared when people couldn't run them.

912
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:28,638
Speaker 1: Because as much as there's a big creative flourishing, 99.999% of all servers for any game during that entire era, we're running absolutely terrible custom configurations that the admin liked that are best forgotten.

913
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:30,640
Speaker 1: to be really blunt about it.

914
00:59:32,321 --> 00:59:34,567
