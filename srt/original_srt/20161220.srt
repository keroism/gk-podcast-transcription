1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,779
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, December 20th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,040
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:14,070
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,637
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:18,170
Speaker 1: Tonight, we're talking about Doom.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,833
Speaker 0: 2016 Doom.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,285
Speaker 1: A new one.

8
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:22,903
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

9
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,336
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah.

10
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:27,769
Speaker 1: I bought the new gaming PC.

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,048
Speaker 1: I'm literally recording Geek Nights on it now.

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:37,969
Speaker 1: And my record of, since I switched to Intel chips, posting successfully the first time I touched the power button?

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:46,363
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I think, you know, we were talking, I think, before about how right now is sort of a time to buy the PC.

14
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:50,490
Speaker 0: because in the one hand, you know, the 1080 is a good time to buy that because it's so new.

15
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:55,290
Speaker 0: And I know there's 1080 TI rumors, but the processor I bought now is the same processor.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:05,290
Speaker 0: I would have bought like a year ago, the same price, but I'm beginning to think maybe it is a good time because even though the CPU feels so old, like why are you buying the CPU now?

17
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,309
Speaker 0: That's already so old.

18
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,449
Speaker 1: They ain't going to get faster.

19
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,369
Speaker 0: Is it so stably right now?

20
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:16,930
Speaker 0: The, I, you know, I put an i5 in my HD PC with a 1070, the new one, and that's like, so spice.

21
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:22,710
Speaker 0: It's like the most stably PC, you know, I'm mispronouncing stable on purpose and not the horse kind.

22
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:28,510
Speaker 0: That's the most stable PC since I've had since the Pentium 3, not even counting the AMD ones, right?

23
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:28,970
Speaker 0: Yeah.

24
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:35,750
Speaker 0: And my current desktop that has like, is, you know, mad blue screening, which I think is because of the motherboard.

25
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:36,850
Speaker 1: That has to be the motherboard.

26
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,050
Speaker 1: That is, that is what caused my previous computer that replaced the one I just replaced.

27
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,670
Speaker 0: So two years ago, I'm sticking with my next time for now and for the foreseeable future, right?

28
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:50,510
Speaker 0: No more gigabyte motherboards, aces only.

29
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:53,870
Speaker 0: I don't care if it costs more money, aces only.

30
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,710
Speaker 1: I was going to get the aces 1080.

31
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,950
Speaker 0: You think it's just brand loyalty.

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,390
Speaker 0: Brands don't mean anything, right?

33
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,970
Speaker 0: I don't care about brands on clothing and I don't care about the brand on the computer.

34
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,250
Speaker 0: I need to show off the fact that it's aces or whatever.

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:12,830
Speaker 0: It's just, I have had in my history of life when buying a bit and aces motherboards as a bit even still around.

36
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:13,290
Speaker 1: I don't know.

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:22,750
Speaker 1: Well, a bit used to be, so in the old days, well, the old days in like the AMD case, seven days, aces and a bit were pretty equivalent.

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:33,810
Speaker 1: I think it's dead now, but it used to be better in terms of a bits would have like more USB headers, like more shit you could do on the motherboard, like raid built in and all this like overclocking nonsense.

39
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:37,849
Speaker 0: But they were less stable point is over the course of like 20 years of my life.

40
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:39,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, aces.

41
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,370
Speaker 0: Mobos have never had any problems that I have bought.

42
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,990
Speaker 0: I'm sure other people can disagree.

43
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:50,650
Speaker 0: Just like I got some brand loyalty with Seagate, even though now Samsung is now the king of storage.

44
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,010
Speaker 0: I'm talking about spinning magnet, spinning magnet disk.

45
00:02:53,030 --> 00:03:00,810
Speaker 1: You know what's fucked up if you went to rim 10, 20 years ago and you were like, yo dog, check out this Western digital hard drive.

46
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:04,490
Speaker 0: Get that not see shit in my face nowadays.

47
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,430
Speaker 1: Actually, if you want a spinning disk, Western digital is really falling off the boat.

48
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,929
Speaker 1: Get the Western digital black.

49
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:12,130
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

50
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,250
Speaker 1: Are those things fast?

51
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,410
Speaker 0: Those cost more monies, though.

52
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:14,945
Speaker 1: It's worth it.

53
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,250
Speaker 1: So when I'm rocking in this thing, I'm going to post the exact, you know, I don't care about the speed of my magnet disk.

54
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:24,050
Speaker 1: I do because, uh, because that's the raid.

55
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,270
Speaker 1: So I have two Western digital black five terabyte drives in a raid.

56
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:28,829
Speaker 0: One is such a bad number.

57
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's fine.

58
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:36,210
Speaker 0: Just, you know what I would do make four terabyte partitions on them and throw away that extra terabyte just because it feels weird.

59
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:40,770
Speaker 0: So you could have a nice, but you're okay with six, six gigabyte.

60
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:41,269
Speaker 1: Why is that?

61
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:41,608
Speaker 1: Okay.

62
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:44,889
Speaker 0: It's even, but it's not, it's not great, but at least it's not five.

63
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,624
Speaker 1: I have 10 terabytes.

64
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:47,609
Speaker 1: That's even.

65
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,106
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

66
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,928
Speaker 1: I just split it in two, rated it.

67
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:58,326
Speaker 1: But, uh, when I'm recording, like Sam capturing video or like capturing, I like to capture directly to the raid.

68
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:03,710
Speaker 1: because if anything goes wrong, now instead of like, if something crazy happens, then I like lose something.

69
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:05,670
Speaker 1: I'm not losing shit with the raid.

70
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,810
Speaker 1: It's a good feeling and all my media is there.

71
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,690
Speaker 1: So I have this workflow now where I can put out, like if I'm editing 4k video, I can save it just to the raid.

72
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:17,750
Speaker 1: So it's safe before I, you know, cause I got to back it up to the cloud or whatever.

73
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:25,289
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was like $200 more total to have 10 terabytes of black instead of 10 terabytes.

74
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,609
Speaker 0: Point is brand sometimes means something.

75
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,040
Speaker 0: Yup.

76
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:28,986
Speaker 0: Sometimes.

77
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:35,410
Speaker 1: But, uh, the other thing is that if I'd bought the computer a year ago, I would add the exact same processor I have now.

78
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,949
Speaker 1: But motherboards got a lot better in the last year.

79
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,270
Speaker 1: Like now you can get like six USB threes and a USB three one if you want it.

80
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,330
Speaker 0: They've been revising the same motherboard layout for a long time.

81
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:47,567
Speaker 0: Yeah.

82
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:51,710
Speaker 1: Like the previous version of my motherboard, the PR version is great.

83
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:52,989
Speaker 1: They are a version.

84
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,809
Speaker 1: The only difference I can see is it's got some bullshit like bling LEDs on it that you can't really turn on.

85
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,950
Speaker 0: That's what the aura means is that the LEDs change color and you can customize the color.

86
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,530
Speaker 1: There's a couple other minor differences in the layout and you get, generally you get more USBs and that kind of stuff.

87
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,906
Speaker 1: And the reviews, the eggs are better, way fewer RMAs cause.

88
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:15,150
Speaker 1: it's like an incremental improvement.

89
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,170
Speaker 0: Why did you put your computer under your feet and not in the computer hole?

90
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:24,810
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of reasons for that, but mostly because I'm actually going to put another hard drive in early next year.

91
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:28,275
Speaker 1: And I can just slide it in without having to unplug all the shit.

92
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:36,990
Speaker 1: early next year is really soon because I ordered the Samsung nine 60 like M dot two crazy drive.

93
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,410
Speaker 1: And the motherfuckers I ordered from sent me a nine 50 like I wouldn't notice.

94
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,130
Speaker 1: So they're going to be a full refund because I was like, send me the nine 60. there were like, we don't have any nine sixties.

95
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:50,429
Speaker 0: That's what I ordered.

96
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:53,430
Speaker 0: But the, oh, it is the deal.

97
00:05:56,794 --> 00:06:08,049
Speaker 1: The, uh, the story with these SSDs right now is that the Samsung nine 60 pros are out in a five 12 gigabyte configuration for like 350 bucks.

98
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,169
Speaker 1: That's insane.

99
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:17,028
Speaker 1: But the five 12 in these nine 50 era was the like top tier in the nine 60 era.

100
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:23,166
Speaker 1: It's the minimum and the one terabyte and two terabyte ones perform way better.

101
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:24,730
Speaker 1: for reasons I don't want to get into right now.

102
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,630
Speaker 1: That's more of a Monday time.

103
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,609
Speaker 0: Whatever's game time.

104
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:38,708
Speaker 1: So if you're going to be really gaming computer guys, wait until like February and you can buy a one terabyte crazy as fast M dot two SSD for your games for like 500, 600 bucks.

105
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,150
Speaker 1: That's not overkill necessarily, but it's, it's not crazy.

106
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,329
Speaker 1: It's just excessive.

107
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:49,450
Speaker 1: So anyway, is there any news other than Mario runner?

108
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:50,929
Speaker 0: No, it's the only game news.

109
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,590
Speaker 0: Even if you go to a gaming news site, it's like the only thing that's on there.

110
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:00,129
Speaker 1: Super Mario run is kind of a big deal for a lot of reasons because you know, me Tomo and all those things came out.

111
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:03,450
Speaker 1: Have any of you launched me Tomo in the last four months?

112
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:04,530
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

113
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:08,110
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe I don't remember what the day I stopped using it was.

114
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,909
Speaker 0: It could have been four months, less than four months ago.

115
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,168
Speaker 1: I actually uninstalled it a couple of weeks ago.

116
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,070
Speaker 0: Do I still have it installed?

117
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:15,609
Speaker 0: Nope.

118
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:19,090
Speaker 1: Cause I was, I was, I was messing with some stuff in the app store and I was like, Oh right.

119
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:19,707
Speaker 1: Me Tomo.

120
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,124
Speaker 1: Haha.

121
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,045
Speaker 1: And I installed it.

122
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:22,430
Speaker 1: That was fun.

123
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:23,928
Speaker 0: It's not installed right now.

124
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:24,419
Speaker 1: Yeah.

125
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:24,941
Speaker 1: Yeah.

126
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,208
Speaker 1: Mario run is.

127
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:26,702
Speaker 1: Yup.

128
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:35,590
Speaker 1: But that was a big deal because it was like Nintendo made a good app on a phone because Nintendo has always been kind of bad about using the world, the ecosystem of phone hardware.

129
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,420
Speaker 0: Well, they just didn't want, you know, Nintendo is like, we make the games, you know, and we want to sell these hardwares and the games.

130
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:44,450
Speaker 0: so that, you know, we're all, we're Nintendo.

131
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,129
Speaker 0: You know, that's how we do.

132
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,250
Speaker 0: That's all we've always done.

133
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:52,650
Speaker 0: And we're mad stubborn in Japanese or the most Japanese and the most stubborn and they're still the most stubborn.

134
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,190
Speaker 0: And even when they give a little bit, they don't give in all the way.

135
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:57,869
Speaker 0: They just give in a little tiny bit.

136
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:58,285
Speaker 0: Yup.

137
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:13,570
Speaker 0: And, but they released, you know, the thing is surprisingly, and Miyamoto said this also, it was like Nintendo and Apple kind of similar keeping secrets, making their own hardware, being really controlling, polishing everything until it's the shiniest.

138
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:15,429
Speaker 0: You know, being late to the party.

139
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:16,162
Speaker 0: Yup.

140
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:16,587
Speaker 0: Right.

141
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:20,350
Speaker 1: You know, sometimes being late to the party makes you the life of the party.

142
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:20,744
Speaker 0: Maybe.

143
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:21,850
Speaker 1: But sometimes.

144
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,650
Speaker 0: The point is Apple and Nintendo, it was obvious to everyone, get along really well.

145
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,329
Speaker 0: Even Apple and Nintendo know this.

146
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:31,308
Speaker 0: So they put out a real Mario game for iPhone, iPad.

147
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,102
Speaker 0: Yeah.

148
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,649
Speaker 1: It's not like Pokemon go.

149
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:36,690
Speaker 1: That's like kind of a bullshitty AR version of Pokemon.

150
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,539
Speaker 0: This is an actual real like, no, you can't say, you know, even if you're one of those pet ants, like.

151
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,370
Speaker 0: this is not a game.

152
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,718
Speaker 0: It is a real video game.

153
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:49,150
Speaker 0: that is a platforming game and requires skills.

154
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,830
Speaker 1: Had this been released for like the Game Boy.

155
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:52,850
Speaker 0: And is difficult.

156
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,770
Speaker 1: It would have been fine.

157
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,448
Speaker 1: Like I would have said great and probably bought it.

158
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:57,349
Speaker 0: Uh, this is the game.

159
00:08:57,876 --> 00:08:58,289
Speaker 0: For 10 bucks?

160
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would have to be a $10 like DS download game or something.

161
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,388
Speaker 1: I would pay 10 bucks to play this on my DS.

162
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:05,670
Speaker 0: Why not?

163
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,515
Speaker 1: Like just if it didn't come out on mobile and they were like, Hey, here's a game we made.

164
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,530
Speaker 1: And I would be like, sure, because the game design of this thing actually pretty slick and clever.

165
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,930
Speaker 1: Like this game is not the simple like baby game you expect.

166
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,289
Speaker 0: I mean, all you're doing literally is you have one control, which is tap the screen anywhere.

167
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:27,828
Speaker 0: And if you tap Mario jumps, if he's already in the air, he does a little spin and slows down for a little bit.

168
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:44,649
Speaker 0: And you know, it's, it's basically depending on the context of where Mario is on the screen, your tap does something different and you need to tap rapidly sometimes, but mostly with extreme precision timing to get Mario to do the things you want him to do.

169
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:49,710
Speaker 0: And if, you know, mostly you just want to get Mario to the end of the level, which is ridiculously easy.

170
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,670
Speaker 0: You only have to jump over the holes.

171
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:56,190
Speaker 0: The bad guys really have a hard time hitting you unless it's like bullet bill or something.

172
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:56,378
Speaker 0: Yeah.

173
00:09:56,871 --> 00:10:02,130
Speaker 0: Or is like you could run right up to a goomba and Mario will just like vault over it and keep walking.

174
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:05,190
Speaker 0: If you don't touch jack shit, it's really hard to die.

175
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,849
Speaker 0: Sometimes you want to die because that's the only way to go backwards and you can't like this.

176
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,607
Speaker 0: No, I'm like, please let there be a piranha plant for me to run into and there isn't.

177
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,289
Speaker 0: and this right because I want it.

178
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,310
Speaker 0: There's no way to go backwards.

179
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,988
Speaker 0: Mario just keeps running to the right almost no matter what.

180
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,410
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's, it's quite difficult.

181
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:43,977
Speaker 0: It just, you know, if you want to start doing fancy stuff like you'll see there's an obvious, you know, different path if you go up, but going up requires like three precision wall jumps and then like a precision jump off a bad guy and then another precision job of bad guy and then you can reach those clouds and get a bunch of bonus coins and it's like, all right, let's try to do that.

182
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:45,810
Speaker 0: and a normal Mario game.

183
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:52,170
Speaker 0: You try to do that and you would fail and you try again and you get it in this.

184
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:54,950
Speaker 0: You fail and then Mario keeps running to the right.

185
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,489
Speaker 0: It's like, fuck you.

186
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,488
Speaker 0: You don't get a second shot.

187
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:57,870
Speaker 0: You got one shot.

188
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:58,350
Speaker 0: That's it.

189
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,290
Speaker 0: Now keep going, Mario.

190
00:10:59,290 --> 00:10:59,868
Speaker 0: You got to restore.

191
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,649
Speaker 0: You want to try again.

192
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,729
Speaker 0: You want to restart the goddamn level.

193
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,749
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like, it's actually hard.

194
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:05,279
Speaker 1: Yup.

195
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:09,490
Speaker 1: Now there's some fascinating circumstances around this game.

196
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:20,269
Speaker 1: So one, the game, and I'm not going to speculate specifically as to why, but it just so happens that right after the game was announced, it was launched and went live.

197
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:28,130
Speaker 1: Nintendo stock basically collapsed like down 15% since December 12.

198
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,355
Speaker 0: I don't know why people are buying and selling that much stock based on one mobile video game.

199
00:11:32,970 --> 00:12:01,929
Speaker 1: I'm not going to necessarily speculate as to whether or not that is the specific cause here, but a lot of people seem to be hinting at the fact that the fact that this game is very poorly rated is a factor because a lot of people might've been looking at this game and deciding that it's a bellwether and whether or not Nintendo is capable of existing in the modern phone app ecosystem and whether or not their ultra premium model, which that's the second part of this.

200
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:08,028
Speaker 1: The fact that this is considered ultra premium was viable because Nintendo charges 10 bucks for this game.

201
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:09,730
Speaker 0: Well, I think their mistake, right?

202
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:11,410
Speaker 0: It was sort of a tough decision, right?

203
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,629
Speaker 0: So obviously apple promoted them.

204
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,650
Speaker 0: Apple and Nintendo both promoted this thing like crazy.

205
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:17,850
Speaker 0: It's a big deal, right?

206
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,948
Speaker 0: And if Nintendo is going to finally make a real game, that's mobile on someone else's platform.

207
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:24,518
Speaker 0: It better do well.

208
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,410
Speaker 0: or Nintendo's being like, well, that didn't work.

209
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:27,249
Speaker 0: Fuck that noise.

210
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:27,548
Speaker 0: Yeah.

211
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,803
Speaker 0: Right.

212
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,075
Speaker 0: So, you know, apple did their best to make it do well because look, apple makes a big cut.

213
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,649
Speaker 0: They wanted to sell a ton too.

214
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,860
Speaker 0: Right.

215
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:39,448
Speaker 0: And you know, if Nintendo is going to make a lot more games for iOS, that would help apple out a ton.

216
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:48,177
Speaker 0: Uh, so anyway, so what they did is they needed it to have a big lot of sales and downloads to get it up in the charts.

217
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:51,430
Speaker 0: because if they do it and it doesn't go up in the charts, well, it looks like a failure.

218
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:56,069
Speaker 0: So they made it free, but only world one is free.

219
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,341
Speaker 0: World one, one, one, two, one, three, and one, four.

220
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:00,707
Speaker 0: after world one, four, you got to pay 10 bucks.

221
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:05,170
Speaker 0: So a lot of people downloaded it and then they were said 10 bucks.

222
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:08,470
Speaker 0: That's a lot of money for compared to most of the games, not just a lot of money.

223
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,110
Speaker 1: The average.

224
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:12,330
Speaker 1: So this is where things get interesting in the mobile ecosystem.

225
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:16,070
Speaker 1: Like two 99 is considered premium.

226
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:21,965
Speaker 0: It's funny that people will like play hearthstone and buy $70 worth of packs of cards.

227
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,290
Speaker 1: I know humans who have put hundreds of dollars into hearthstone, right?

228
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:39,450
Speaker 1: There are people out there like, you know who you are, you, you, who I was talking to on Google about this like two days ago, not spend that much money on hearthstone.

229
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:45,369
Speaker 0: I know it's good, but Jesus son, well, I mean, even the thing is hearthstone, even spending hundreds, it's cheaper than magic.

230
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:48,769
Speaker 0: It's actually cheap as far as collectible games go.

231
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:58,210
Speaker 0: But but anyway, yeah, there are two fundamental care people spending more money on free games for bonus shit than they're spending on Mario.

232
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:00,081
Speaker 0: But then they're complaining that Mario is 10 bucks.

233
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:03,158
Speaker 0: because psychologically you got this game for free and they got paid 10 bucks.

234
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,530
Speaker 0: just made it 10 bucks up front.

235
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,878
Speaker 0: Like if you want to play, you got to pay 10 bucks.

236
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,426
Speaker 0: if nobody, the sales would have been low.

237
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,253
Speaker 0: It wouldn't have gone up.

238
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:14,845
Speaker 1: in the itunes top problem is that freedom.

239
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,830
Speaker 1: So it's two, two problems.

240
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,584
Speaker 1: One is now you've got this clash of worlds between, you

241
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:22,895
Speaker 0: also got people who don't got 10 bucks as their kids, but

242
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:32,829
Speaker 1: gamer people who would self describe as gamers who know about games in a general sense and have a vague basic understanding of the broad ecosystem of gaming as a whole.

243
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:41,848
Speaker 1: And then you've got the masses, the smart, the app market on phones is pretty much the masses.

244
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,910
Speaker 1: And the well for the masses has been poisoned by free to play.

245
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:55,170
Speaker 1: The average person who is not a gamer, when you ask about games, they think about games on their phone and they assume that those games are all free.

246
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:56,788
Speaker 1: That is it.

247
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,870
Speaker 1: That is the ecosystem.

248
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,530
Speaker 1: Getting them to pay more than zero is already a big ask.

249
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:07,729
Speaker 1: And then they download the game that's top of the promotions like, oh, all right, some Mario game.

250
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,410
Speaker 1: I've heard of Mario and they play it and it's fun.

251
00:15:09,872 --> 00:15:14,270
Speaker 1: And then it has for that $10 that is literally insane to them.

252
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,469
Speaker 1: Like that is fucking nuts.

253
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:20,430
Speaker 1: And they're pissed and they're reading the game one star.

254
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,463
Speaker 1: And as a result, the game has 60,000 ratings as of Dateline, uh, 6 34 PM, December 20th.

255
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:33,529
Speaker 1: And its average score is 2.5 and a five star rating system that is effectively zero.

256
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:34,206
Speaker 0: Hmm.

257
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,710
Speaker 0: I mean, it's people giving a five stars cause they paid the 10 bucks, didn't care about paying 10 bucks.

258
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:46,970
Speaker 1: Well, the five star people are the people who expected this to be an interesting Mario game and saw that $10 is pretty cheap for a real game.

259
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:54,121
Speaker 1: I mean, it's the cheapest Mario game has ever been, but normal people who don't know about games, give it one star because what the fuck is this bullshit?

260
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:54,443
Speaker 1: $10 WTF made, right?

261
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:57,570
Speaker 0: They're not judging the game.

262
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,349
Speaker 0: They're judging the $10, you know, for any iPhone game ever.

263
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:06,630
Speaker 0: It also wants to get, you could make fucking like final fantasy.

264
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:07,450
Speaker 0: What's the new one?

265
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,057
Speaker 0: Yup.

266
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:24,790
Speaker 0: You can make final fantasy 16 the whole game, the whole game, iPhone only exclusive, I iOS exclusive and charge 10 bucks for it and, but it's a full final fantasy, just as big as final fantasy 16 should be or will be when it comes out.

267
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,730
Speaker 0: Cause it's definitely going to come out at some point, right?

268
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,249
Speaker 0: For years.

269
00:16:28,092 --> 00:16:30,210
Speaker 0: Uh, and people would be like 10 bucks, what the fuck is this shit?

270
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,844
Speaker 0: But the same game on PS four people be like game of years, $70.

271
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:35,089
Speaker 0: don't give a fuck.

272
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:39,110
Speaker 1: Now that also is interesting cause this gives us some data we never really had before.

273
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,650
Speaker 1: The reviews are pretty much all one star or five star.

274
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:50,089
Speaker 0: There's almost nothing in the middle, which there aren't a lot of one star reviews that say paid 10 bucks.

275
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,509
Speaker 0: Don't like this game.

276
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:52,008
Speaker 0: It's shitty.

277
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:52,870
Speaker 0: Right?

278
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,730
Speaker 0: However, there is a part of the game that is not so great, right?

279
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,104
Speaker 0: So the good part of the game, at least as far as I'm concerned is the main solo part of the game.

280
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,270
Speaker 0: You play these, it's got like six worlds of four levels each, right?

281
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:16,205
Speaker 0: And in each world, you know, it's a little short levels, but the levels, each level has replayability times three because not only getting to the end of the level is a cake walk.

282
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:24,089
Speaker 0: It's automatically running you there with very little things that will actually kill you and you can come back to life a bunch of times and it's, it's not difficult, right?

283
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:32,805
Speaker 0: I beat the game like on my first shot, just like straight through, but in each level there's five coins to get and you got to get all five coins in one.

284
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:33,810
Speaker 0: go for it to count.

285
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:39,090
Speaker 0: So you get all the pink coins, then the level changes and now you get all the purple coins.

286
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:44,609
Speaker 0: And then when you get all the purple coins in one shot, the level changes and there's the five black coins.

287
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:46,225
Speaker 0: Fuck the five black coins.

288
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:52,190
Speaker 0: Not to be racist against those coins because it's not the color that's the problem.

289
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:53,168
Speaker 0: It is their location.

290
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:56,790
Speaker 0: The level changes in a very devious fashion.

291
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,669
Speaker 0: You think really how devious could it be a game where you only have to push a, you don't even got to push.

292
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,848
Speaker 1: I was looking at some youtube videos and you're like, like it's a spot that you wouldn't even can.

293
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:16,810
Speaker 0: I was able to get all five black coins in world one, one and world one, two and in world one dash three, there's some coins I'm seeing and I'm like, how the fuck do you get?

294
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:24,530
Speaker 0: Like how do you even, and you to make it even worse, like I could maybe get up there if it was a regular Mario game and I could go backwards.

295
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:25,610
Speaker 0: You can't go backwards.

296
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:27,070
Speaker 0: You got one shot at each coin.

297
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:27,564
Speaker 0: You miss it.

298
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,027
Speaker 0: Restart the whole goddamn level.

299
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:30,808
Speaker 0: Oh, I missed the first coin.

300
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:32,270
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't matter.

301
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,209
Speaker 0: Restart the whole level.

302
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,468
Speaker 0: Oh, you missed the fifth coin.

303
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,490
Speaker 0: Restart again.

304
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:36,646
Speaker 0: Go back and get the first guy.

305
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,349
Speaker 0: And he's just like, you know, but that's the good part of the game.

306
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:49,310
Speaker 0: The not so good part of the game is the mobile ish type part of the game where you get toads and coins to build your town like a kind of thing.

307
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,370
Speaker 0: And basically this is toad rallies.

308
00:18:51,430 --> 00:19:02,447
Speaker 0: You get toad rally tickets to go in the toad rally and it basically makes you play a level and you're playing the level against someone else's ghost of that level, like sort of like Mario Kart.

309
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:13,950
Speaker 0: There's a little like paper Mario that does the level in their place and you got to do the level better than they did it, which means getting more coins and more points, which means doing more fancy moves.

310
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,370
Speaker 0: You do more fancy moves, you get coin rush, you get more coins, you get more points.

311
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:25,807
Speaker 0: And if you do the level better than the person you chose to go against, you take some of their toads and you get more toads.

312
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:37,169
Speaker 0: But if they do the level, if you don't do the level better than them, you lose toads and you try and just increase your total toad army to level up your town and also get coins to buy shit for your town.

313
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:41,249
Speaker 0: And it's sort of love it or hate it kind of thing.

314
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:43,670
Speaker 1: I see most people seem to love it, which is interesting.

315
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:52,129
Speaker 0: It's kind of fun to do a toad rally kind of, but not as fun as trying to get all five coins and mastering the levels.

316
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:55,969
Speaker 0: But I really don't give a shit about what my mushroom kingdom looks like.

317
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:03,967
Speaker 1: So the five stars are basically the pool of people who are actually gamers who play games on their phones.

318
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,187
Speaker 1: The pool of one stars are normal people who have heard of Mario and are pissed off that they have to pay any amount of money.

319
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:14,590
Speaker 0: Mario is like, you know, the Mercedes of games.

320
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,090
Speaker 0: You ain't going to give me for free.

321
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,030
Speaker 1: So what, pray tell, is in the two, three, four reviews?

322
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,329
Speaker 1: And there aren't that many.

323
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,428
Speaker 1: So I poked around in them.

324
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:25,061
Speaker 1: And what I learned is that the two reviews are mostly.

325
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:29,350
Speaker 1: the game requires an Internet connection 100 percent of the time or it stops working.

326
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:29,906
Speaker 1: That's true.

327
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,210
Speaker 1: You can't actually play it on the go on the first.

328
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,370
Speaker 0: Originally, I'm like, man, that sucks.

329
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,550
Speaker 0: I would really like to play this game on the subway, but it's a good game, so I'll play it anyway.

330
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:39,750
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's bullshit.

331
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:40,930
Speaker 0: You should let me play on the subway.

332
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,650
Speaker 1: That is insane.

333
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,109
Speaker 1: Literally no game I own.

334
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:50,810
Speaker 1: I have a lot of games on my phone won't work if I'm underground, however, or especially the solo part of the game, right?

335
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:51,104
Speaker 0: Yeah.

336
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,490
Speaker 0: However, I realized a subway is kind of shaky.

337
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:57,328
Speaker 0: You can't.

338
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:06,030
Speaker 0: It's not good to play a game that even on my 3DS sitting on the subway, I can't play games that are like real time action because it's fucking shaking.

339
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,590
Speaker 0: Well, dude, I remember I need absolute stillness and stability.

340
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:23,606
Speaker 1: I was remastering those beta episodes of Geek Nights in 2005 for the Patreon and one of them you're talking about playing the surgeon game on the DS and how you can't play it on the train.

341
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:25,449
Speaker 1: You'll just kill it.

342
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,250
Speaker 1: There's no way.

343
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,350
Speaker 0: So I guess that's not an old van Scott problem.

344
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,870
Speaker 0: That's also, you know, young Scott problem.

345
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,870
Speaker 1: But here's all the problems.

346
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,229
Speaker 1: Like I couldn't play it in the bathroom at work because there's just no data in there.

347
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,010
Speaker 0: See, that's bull.

348
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:36,709
Speaker 0: That's a problem.

349
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,689
Speaker 1: I couldn't play it at PAX.

350
00:21:37,873 --> 00:21:38,608
Speaker 1: Like most taxes.

351
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:39,750
Speaker 1: You can't get internet.

352
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,689
Speaker 1: Like it just doesn't work.

353
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,190
Speaker 0: The thing is you just need barely enough internet rather give any data at all.

354
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:44,908
Speaker 0: It's going to work.

355
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:46,229
Speaker 0: You don't need like real data.

356
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:53,289
Speaker 1: You know, I can watch a Netflix movie with no internet on my phone now and yet I can't play Super Mario run.

357
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,195
Speaker 1: That just seems.

358
00:21:55,235 --> 00:22:00,087
Speaker 0: Nintendo is, you know, that's who they are, but it still has friend codes and bullshit.

359
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,389
Speaker 0: It doesn't just let you use game center or whatever.

360
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,210
Speaker 1: And it seems like all the two and three star reviews are those kinds of complaints.

361
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,208
Speaker 0: Like the complaints about the middling bits, right?

362
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:17,387
Speaker 0: Like someone like a four star review might be someone who likes the game, didn't care about spending 10 bucks, but really doesn't like the toad rally, right?

363
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:24,510
Speaker 0: Whereas I look at it and say, well, I don't like the toad rally part either, but they're being extra crap attached to a good game.

364
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:26,070
Speaker 0: Doesn't diminish the good game.

365
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:26,788
Speaker 0: That's already there.

366
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:27,020
Speaker 0: Yeah.

367
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:28,589
Speaker 1: Unless it gets in your way, right?

368
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:35,970
Speaker 0: It's like if I buy Puerto Rico, the best board game there is, and there's 10 garbage expansions in the box and I just throw those out and the rest of the game is still good.

369
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,970
Speaker 0: That doesn't make the existing Puerto Rico worse.

370
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,909
Speaker 1: But imagine if the expansions were printed on the board and like you had to like ignore them, but they were always there in your way.

371
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,470
Speaker 0: Toad rally's not in your way.

372
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,550
Speaker 0: Just don't touch toad rally.

373
00:22:46,752 --> 00:22:47,330
Speaker 0: It's one button.

374
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,925
Speaker 0: Don't touch it.

375
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:56,970
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

376
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:58,230
Speaker 0: I got so many things of the day.

377
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,250
Speaker 0: Which one shall I use?

378
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,110
Speaker 0: This great bounty.

379
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:00,430
Speaker 0: I

380
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:16,370
Speaker 1: also have many partly because, well, lot of reasons partly because I also rebuilt the HTPC by cascading parts down and now it's running on an SSD and I was like watching a lot of YouTube videos and there's a bunch of stuff in the living room and I found this just pretty funny little comedy bit.

381
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:32,230
Speaker 1: It's short and it's about, it's the, the workers and sieve and one of them is a worker from like sieve two, three, four and the sieve six guy is explaining to him how his job is different now and it was actually pretty funny.

382
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,350
Speaker 1: Like it has a pretty good payoff.

383
00:23:33,471 --> 00:23:33,703
Speaker 1: It was good.

384
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:34,468
Speaker 1: It's short.

385
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,450
Speaker 0: All right, so this guy in the Netherlands, a good land.

386
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:39,528
Speaker 0: It's in the nether places.

387
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:42,010
Speaker 1: I got good stuff in my nether places.

388
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:49,189
Speaker 0: He, his phone got stolen and he realized like, oh man, shit, if your phone is stolen, that's like the worst.

389
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,269
Speaker 0: I guess he didn't realize that before his phone was stolen.

390
00:23:52,090 --> 00:24:04,769
Speaker 0: So then he got a new phone and on that new phone, he put spyware, the kind that lets you completely control the phone from anywhere as long as the phone has internets.

391
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:10,130
Speaker 0: And then he let this new phone get stole on purpose.

392
00:24:11,678 --> 00:24:12,310
Speaker 1: That ain't bad.

393
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,550
Speaker 1: He just like got it hanging like out of his pocket, got the phone stolen on purpose somehow.

394
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:31,829
Speaker 0: And now he took the footage that was recorded from the spyware on that phone that he collected as much as he could and created this 20 plus minute long short film of the journey of the stolen phone.

395
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,429
Speaker 0: It's a short film known as find my phone.

396
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:37,388
Speaker 0: It is a good film.

397
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,386
Speaker 1: Good stuff.

398
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,825
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the booklet book is Rebecca.

399
00:24:42,312 --> 00:24:42,630
Speaker 1: Rebecca.

400
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,247
Speaker 1: Sounds like you're reading it, so I'm going to start reading it in earnest and finish it pretty quick.

401
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:56,748
Speaker 0: I'm reading it quite a, you know, the timer on the Kindle says a number of hours and then it seems to that time it reports goes down faster than the actual clock does like.

402
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:59,227
Speaker 0: I'll be reading it and I'll be reading it for 15 minutes.

403
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:03,050
Speaker 0: But the estimated time to finishing went down by like an hour.

404
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,265
Speaker 0: And it's like, OK, I guess you're really bad at estimating.

405
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:07,886
Speaker 0: I'm going to finish this when I don't know.

406
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:15,770
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we're going to be at Magfest doing six panels across four days of Magfest.

407
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,630
Speaker 1: Oh, it's coming.

408
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:19,710
Speaker 1: I'm feeling Magfest real hard.

409
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:25,249
Speaker 0: Like I only have one and a half more days of work.

410
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:26,370
Speaker 1: All right.

411
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,930
Speaker 0: In 2016.

412
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:42,229
Speaker 0: And then, you know, how many days of work I have before Magfest, zero, three and a half more days of work because I go back to work on like the Tuesday and then work on a Wednesday and then a Magfest on a Thursday.

413
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:47,769
Speaker 1: Like Pax is super fun, but I go to between three and five Pax's a year.

414
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:50,430
Speaker 0: So there's only one Magfest.

415
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,806
Speaker 1: Yeah.

416
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:52,349
Speaker 1: Like Pax I'm excited about.

417
00:25:52,712 --> 00:25:56,608
Speaker 1: But but like right after Pax Prime, I'm not like, oh, man, I got to wait another year for this.

418
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,410
Speaker 1: Like, oh, there's another Pax coming.

419
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,470
Speaker 1: Like pretty soon, actually.

420
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,009
Speaker 1: Pax out.

421
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,629
Speaker 0: Let's go after Magfest is over.

422
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:01,910
Speaker 0: Yeah.

423
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,329
Speaker 0: Pax out.

424
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:03,847
Speaker 1: Pax out is like right there.

425
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,229
Speaker 1: So right after Magfest, we're going to Pax out.

426
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:08,910
Speaker 0: And if you want to enforce it, Pax East.

427
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,210
Speaker 0: If you are a previous Pax East enforcer, do stuff.

428
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:12,659
Speaker 1: Yep.

429
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,490
Speaker 1: Stuff's happening.

430
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,269
Speaker 0: Stuff is now.

431
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,904
Speaker 1: Do your stuff.

432
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:16,968
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

433
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,924
Speaker 1: Otherwise, the Patreon for Geek Knights is going strong and I'm uploading more and more content.

434
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:29,430
Speaker 1: I think Emily and I will be reviewing the new Doctor Strange movie pretty soon because actually Emily read all the Doctor Strange comics a long time ago and I never did.

435
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,190
Speaker 1: So we had different perspectives on the movie, which is interesting.

436
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:33,126
Speaker 0: You and me.

437
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,130
Speaker 0: There's there are many various different Doctor Strange comics.

438
00:26:37,793 --> 00:26:39,850
Speaker 1: I feel like everyone, cause I haven't read any of them.

439
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:41,836
Speaker 0: There's so many different ones.

440
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:54,150
Speaker 0: is like, you know, you could almost like if you read some new ones and someone else read some old ones and someone else read some like nineties ones, but it's like everyone would think something different about, you know, Doctor Strange.

441
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:54,607
Speaker 0: Yup.

442
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,686
Speaker 0: Like who he is.

443
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:02,425
Speaker 1: So all that aside, Scott a while ago played the new 2016 doom and he told me I should play it.

444
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:17,929
Speaker 1: I installed it on my previous computer and it was not a good enough experience to where I would be willing to play it all the way through the 770 and the Nehalem, uh, I seven and the 12 gigabytes of Ram.

445
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,127
Speaker 1: Not enough.

446
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,270
Speaker 0: I played it on my six 80 and originally it was running just fine.

447
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,130
Speaker 0: I mean like it wasn't beautiful and amazing.

448
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,910
Speaker 0: It was just, it was plenty good, uh, but it was crashy a bit and I thought this was related to the blue screens.

449
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:46,570
Speaker 0: I mean I busted computer, but actually apparently it was cause of this crappy DRM that they included in it and that DRM in a patch that came out after I beat the game has been removed, but I was able to reduce the crashiness quite a bit also by lowering the settings.

450
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:53,313
Speaker 0: So I use the settings suggested by the G force experience and not the settings suggested by the

451
00:27:53,353 --> 00:28:03,070
Speaker 1: G force experience on my seven 70, which is a way better is well faster than your six 80 and a lot of ways that are relevant for gaming, but my motherboards old.

452
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:05,210
Speaker 1: So the seven 70 wasn't running at full potential.

453
00:28:05,872 --> 00:28:08,105
Speaker 1: So it's kind of like a wash game.

454
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:08,930
Speaker 1: didn't look that great.

455
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:18,150
Speaker 0: Like it was playable, but I mean I had it on low, I originally had it on the medium settings that were suggested and it looked just fine on the low settings.

456
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,010
Speaker 0: It also looked just fine.

457
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:26,159
Speaker 0: It wasn't like back in the day where you turn the settings down in tribes too and everything's just like gray rectangles on the new computer.

458
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:32,885
Speaker 1: cause I got the 10 80, uh, I sure it looks better to the absolute 100% maximum like crazy.

459
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,010
Speaker 1: Like I turned on the shit that you would not turn on on a 10 70.

460
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,070
Speaker 1: Holy shit, does it look different and locked 60 FPS the entire time.

461
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,290
Speaker 1: It is beautiful.

462
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:50,760
Speaker 1: Even Emily, like I'm playing the game and even in the right in the beginning, you know when you're like inside the UAC facility,

463
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:52,066
Speaker 0: the triple a game is new

464
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:57,619
Speaker 1: and then you see that door and you can go outside and you see like the orange Mad Max dystopia of Mars out there.

465
00:28:58,215 --> 00:28:58,927
Speaker 1: You walk out.

466
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:06,750
Speaker 1: Emily was standing behind me and she was like, holy shit, it looks great by the 10 80 guys like Jesus.

467
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:07,685
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

468
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:14,934
Speaker 0: Or I mean the other thing, right, is like, uh, it looks great, but I'm still the same mind I was in.

469
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:18,429
Speaker 0: like the nineties where it's like, I don't care about graphics that much.

470
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,566
Speaker 0: I care about the game.

471
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:20,229
Speaker 0: Yeah.

472
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,405
Speaker 0: The game's just as good on the seven seventies.

473
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,130
Speaker 0: You don't even notice the graphics while you're playing, right?

474
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:33,890
Speaker 1: But the thing is when I was playing with the 10 80, like when I played that great, are they $600?

475
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,004
Speaker 0: Great.

476
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,410
Speaker 0: Is that really worth $600?

477
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:36,970
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing.

478
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:39,669
Speaker 0: You can play the game with a video card that costs half as much.

479
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,110
Speaker 1: It's not just that it looks crazy great.

480
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:49,270
Speaker 0: Like you could get the 10 70 if you're, you can play this thing with like a nine something just fine.

481
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,470
Speaker 1: Maybe like a nine 79 80.

482
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:51,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

483
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:52,366
Speaker 0: Why not?

484
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,989
Speaker 1: You might get occasional frame dips unless you turn stuff down.

485
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:55,667
Speaker 0: Oh no.

486
00:29:56,451 --> 00:30:01,670
Speaker 1: I, because I've been playing a lot of like semi serious FPS is again, frame dips are.

487
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,270
Speaker 1: I will not tolerate a frame dip.

488
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,290
Speaker 1: Like I cannot play with frame dips anymore.

489
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,450
Speaker 1: Like I will turn down everything.

490
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:12,414
Speaker 1: It will be gray models with no lighting in the background before I will take a frame dip.

491
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,210
Speaker 0: And I was mostly just upset about crashing.

492
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,930
Speaker 0: It wasn't crashing.

493
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,765
Speaker 0: I was just, I was fine at 30 FPS.

494
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:26,890
Speaker 1: So it was crashing until I turned the settings way down in the seven 70. but I think I was overheating the seven 70. but anyway, enough of that.

495
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:31,710
Speaker 1: The game is a worthy successor to doom in a lot of ways.

496
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:32,407
Speaker 0: It's not doom.

497
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,211
Speaker 0: It's like.

498
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:39,830
Speaker 0: part of it is doom and part of it's not doomed, but it's still a good fun single player FPS kind of thing.

499
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,069
Speaker 1: Part of it's half life too.

500
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,489
Speaker 0: Part of it is half life too, but pretty good half life too.

501
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,570
Speaker 0: Like kinda like not as, it's not as good at half life too as half life too.

502
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,730
Speaker 1: Like here's the thing that half life two does is real.

503
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:53,110
Speaker 1: It's a good thing to bring up.

504
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,149
Speaker 1: Half life two will have two.

505
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,149
Speaker 1: There's two like hallmarks of half life too.

506
00:30:56,592 --> 00:31:04,050
Speaker 1: One of them is you're in a room, you can walk around, but there's kind of a cinematic happening around you and it won't let you leave until all the people stop talking.

507
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,930
Speaker 1: Doom and half life two both do that.

508
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:06,106
Speaker 0: Yeah.

509
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,229
Speaker 0: Doom does not have cut scenes really.

510
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:09,829
Speaker 0: Oh, it has a few actually.

511
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,910
Speaker 1: But even then, they're pretty insignificant.

512
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,028
Speaker 0: That's not like it stops and shows you a fucking movie.

513
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,004
Speaker 1: And two with the thing that half life two did brilliantly.

514
00:31:18,064 --> 00:31:22,143
Speaker 1: that like, like that is why that game is to this day, like such a brilliant game is.

515
00:31:22,203 --> 00:31:30,210
Speaker 1: it will get you into a mood where you do things that feel natural and are guided subtly into doing things that end up feeling very cinematic.

516
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:50,289
Speaker 1: Like the best example of that is in the, in the like apartment tower in the early part of half life two, where like you're talking to some people and they're like barred guards are busting in in the basement and you're like trying to get away and like you jumped through the window and like the game doesn't necessarily railroad you into that, but it sort of guides you into doing this really cinematic thing.

517
00:31:50,932 --> 00:31:58,389
Speaker 1: Doom does that several times, not as well as half life two did, but way better than any game other than half life two has ever done it.

518
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:04,110
Speaker 0: So here, I mean, mostly it's a single player FPS game with levels and you beat it eventually, right?

519
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:11,381
Speaker 0: Now here's where, here's how the flow of it works and how it differs subtly and maybe not so subtly from other FPS.

520
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:12,690
Speaker 0: is that are single player, right?

521
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:25,845
Speaker 0: First of all, uh, you know, the maps are very doomish and that, you know, you even have, you can press tab to look at the map and you get the key to open the key door and then you get the other key to open the other key door, right?

522
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:34,490
Speaker 0: And the weapon will be up on a pedestal and a real, it's like the level design, despite it being modern and 3d is very doom inspired.

523
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:41,670
Speaker 1: It felt real close to like the levels in the second and third thirds of doom two in particular.

524
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:42,129
Speaker 0: Yup.

525
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:47,689
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, the music and the music, the combat is very doom, right?

526
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,927
Speaker 0: It's pretty much the doom soundtrack, but played with real guitars and not with a mini controller.

527
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,270
Speaker 1: I'm going to tell you, I didn't think about it.

528
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,270
Speaker 1: Like the game starts and this metal music starts.

529
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,008
Speaker 1: I'm like, all right.

530
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:06,789
Speaker 1: But then the metal music kind of like how the Wolverine versus the X-Men had the melody from the old nineties X-Men cartoon in it just like done modern and like changed up.

531
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:11,090
Speaker 1: You hear the original doom melody, like come in and it's good.

532
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,008
Speaker 0: The music is good.

533
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:18,116
Speaker 0: However, it didn't get me as pumped as original doom music, but it got me like 80% of the 80% there.

534
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:18,821
Speaker 0: Yeah.

535
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:24,795
Speaker 0: It's not bad, but it's like the original doom music, like it's like, it's just like tribes too.

536
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,788
Speaker 0: It's like, Oh man, you are ready to go.

537
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,650
Speaker 1: But what it does differently is that it has semi dynamic music.

538
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,470
Speaker 1: So doom would have like a pumping up song.

539
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,090
Speaker 1: Like every, every level has a different music in the music.

540
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,402
Speaker 0: I'm going to tell you a bad secret and that the music and doom isn't as dynamic as you think it is.

541
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:42,669
Speaker 1: Uh, in this doom.

542
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,090
Speaker 1: Yeah.

543
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:44,990
Speaker 1: I know I have figured out the triggers already.

544
00:33:45,172 --> 00:33:45,467
Speaker 0: Okay.

545
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:52,949
Speaker 1: It's basically, did you find the thing that you have to do in the level that's causing the like more monsters to appear or not?

546
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,210
Speaker 0: Oh, that's not how it works either, but okay.

547
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:01,161
Speaker 1: Cause that's, that's the only thing I noticed so far is that, you know, when you find the thing and like pull the heart out and then a bunch of monsters appear and you gotta fight them.

548
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:01,590
Speaker 0: Yup.

549
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,050
Speaker 1: The music will like kick into high gear then until you beat them all.

550
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:06,649
Speaker 0: So you didn't play the whole game.

551
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,150
Speaker 1: Not yet.

552
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,599
Speaker 0: But basically the structure of each level.

553
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,210
Speaker 0: in regular doom, do one doom too, right?

554
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,070
Speaker 0: It's just get to the fucking exit.

555
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,748
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

556
00:34:15,491 --> 00:34:18,710
Speaker 1: Every level is its own thing and the music is just the level.

557
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:23,949
Speaker 0: It's just get to the goddamn exit as quickly or as safely as you possibly can.

558
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:27,109
Speaker 0: And if you're killing demons on the way, do that.

559
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,210
Speaker 0: This doom is not like that.

560
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:35,250
Speaker 0: What will happen in this doom is that you will go into areas and it will lock you in basically each level.

561
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:37,350
Speaker 0: There's only like token bad guys around.

562
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:39,750
Speaker 0: There aren't really a lot of demons around, right?

563
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:46,230
Speaker 0: There's only a few here and there to sort of fill up the environment and they're usually the weak kind that really can't do anything to you and go down.

564
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:56,949
Speaker 0: It's like one regular shotgun shot, but you'll get into an area that's either locks you in right with physically locking the doors behind you or locking the doors in front of you.

565
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,355
Speaker 0: So you can't proceed or both.

566
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:05,670
Speaker 0: or has one of the like an item that you interact with, like grab the key or push a button or the gory heart out of the gore thing.

567
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:05,886
Speaker 1: Yeah.

568
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,410
Speaker 0: Pull the gory heart of the gore thing.

569
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,830
Speaker 0: And it's like, okay, now is combat time.

570
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:15,448
Speaker 0: So it's like combat time in regular doom, do one, do two is always like do two.

571
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:18,770
Speaker 1: level will start and there's like a siren even coming at you.

572
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:22,049
Speaker 0: It's like, go, go, go, do not stop ever in this.

573
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,109
Speaker 0: It's walk around and chill, then combat time.

574
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:36,950
Speaker 0: Then you must kill every bad guy during combat time and then combat time ends and you can chill again and you, it's, it's, it's exploring time, combat time, exploring time, combat time.

575
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:41,590
Speaker 1: I'm looking for the level because the entire game so far reminds me of one specific level in doom too.

576
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:45,513
Speaker 0: I just got to remember which one it is, but the whole game is like this from beginning to end.

577
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:52,354
Speaker 1: tricks and traps in doom to this entire game feels like that map, map eight in doom too.

578
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,309
Speaker 0: It's just explore time, combat time.

579
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:55,809
Speaker 0: One after another.

580
00:35:56,857 --> 00:35:57,087
Speaker 0: Yeah.

581
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,210
Speaker 0: You explore as much as you can get as much goodies as you can.

582
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,905
Speaker 0: There's a lot of secrets just like doom, right?

583
00:36:03,551 --> 00:36:03,742
Speaker 0: You know?

584
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:09,610
Speaker 0: And then when you're ready for the combat, you start the combat and you have to kill all the demons.

585
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:16,030
Speaker 0: If there's even one demon you failed to kill, the music will still be, you know, rocking on and you got to, you know, that's a bad guy somewhere.

586
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,040
Speaker 0: You got to find the problem is half the time.

587
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,798
Speaker 1: it's like one imp who's just like fucking around and you can't, there have been times.

588
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:26,369
Speaker 0: there was a time, uh, one time where the music kept playing and I ran around for 10 minutes.

589
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,399
Speaker 0: It couldn't find the guy.

590
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,349
Speaker 1: that happened to me too.

591
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:30,209
Speaker 0: So I quit and redid it.

592
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,310
Speaker 0: And I, that second time was just fine.

593
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:37,690
Speaker 1: I found the guy and luckily I leveled up the, uh, the, the assault rifle with all the zoom damage stuff.

594
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,010
Speaker 0: I also, that was also my weapon of choice.

595
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:45,783
Speaker 0: The zoomy assault rifle that I upgraded all the way, but it felt so undoomed like to use that.

596
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,429
Speaker 0: Yeah.

597
00:36:46,590 --> 00:37:00,709
Speaker 0: It's not about zooming and sniping that I feel like you shouldn't even have zooming and sniping and doom, but the levels are designed in such a way that there were a lot of opportunities to use it with great effectiveness and it meant that I could stay far away from dangerous demons and not die.

598
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:02,409
Speaker 0: So I used it.

599
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:09,788
Speaker 1: So tricks and traps in doom two, one, if you use like doom editors, that was the default map.

600
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,289
Speaker 1: They'd throw you in if you just launched the game.

601
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,629
Speaker 1: So that's why a lot of people just like specifically remember it.

602
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:17,290
Speaker 1: But the way that map started is you're in this room and it's octagonal.

603
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:18,969
Speaker 1: There's eight doors.

604
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:24,410
Speaker 1: Each door goes to like a tricky place with its own bullshit.

605
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,050
Speaker 1: And that's literally what this game is like.

606
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,270
Speaker 1: Like you go into a place and it's got some bullshit you have to deal with.

607
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,730
Speaker 1: Then you go to another place that's separate, that has different bullshit, right?

608
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:39,482
Speaker 0: It's almost like each, they had different people design map pieces and they just sort of stuck them together in a way.

609
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,970
Speaker 0: But the thing is, a lot of those pieces are just like a big room.

610
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,890
Speaker 0: You're locked in with a whole bunch of demons, kill them all.

611
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:53,889
Speaker 0: Now it's interesting though, because one thing that doom and especially doom two and it forces you to kill them all, you can't just like run through to the exit.

612
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,628
Speaker 0: Like you couldn't do doom two.

613
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,488
Speaker 1: Actually this map did that a lot.

614
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,330
Speaker 1: A lot of the rooms you went into would lock you in and now you're stuck and you have to kill all the monsters to trigger.

615
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:08,068
Speaker 1: I think it was trigger six, six, six and anyway, there's a trigger in doom because that's how the game work.

616
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,350
Speaker 1: You would have triggers that will cause events like do the thing and the door will open.

617
00:38:12,071 --> 00:38:19,089
Speaker 1: One of the triggers is when the last monster in this room dies, does do the thing or when this monster dies, do the thing.

618
00:38:19,892 --> 00:38:22,570
Speaker 1: The whole game is just map 08 of doom two anyway.

619
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:31,310
Speaker 0: So, uh, the bad guys themselves though are a 90% of them are bad guys from old doom games that have been recreated in magnificent fashion.

620
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,290
Speaker 1: Like the amps are great.

621
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,469
Speaker 0: They're just amps only fancier in 3d and modern and kind of creepy throwing fireballs at you.

622
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:41,249
Speaker 0: But you can tell they're an imp right away when you look at them.

623
00:38:41,931 --> 00:38:46,466
Speaker 0: There are certain bad guys that were not used very much in old doom that are now used a great deal.

624
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:48,170
Speaker 0: What's the guy's name?

625
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,670
Speaker 0: The big fat guy with like, he's all tech, mancubus.

626
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:51,950
Speaker 0: Yeah.

627
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:57,348
Speaker 0: Mancubus is like all over this game, even though he was not used very often at all in the old dooms.

628
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:58,289
Speaker 0: Is there an arch vial?

629
00:38:59,097 --> 00:38:59,668
Speaker 0: Which one's that?

630
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,160
Speaker 1: That's the guy who can resurrect people.

631
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:02,350
Speaker 1: is the wizard with the yellow fire.

632
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:09,270
Speaker 0: Uh, maybe there's, there's one thing is there's only one spider and one cyber demon, which is disappointing.

633
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,248
Speaker 1: Is there a commander keen?

634
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:18,969
Speaker 0: Uh, maybe there's, there are many barons of hell plant, you know, it's just, uh, the invisible, you know, that's the arch vial.

635
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:22,570
Speaker 0: No, the invisible demons that just run up to you, right?

636
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,010
Speaker 0: You actually don't see those till a bit later.

637
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:29,070
Speaker 0: The pink guys, pinky, the regular old demon is like kind of a dangerous dude in this game.

638
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:30,830
Speaker 0: Uh, and he doesn't show up till later.

639
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:36,389
Speaker 0: You think he'd show up earlier, but yeah, it's all the guys, you know, uh, one of the thing is the old doom.

640
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:43,450
Speaker 0: There was Caco demon and there was the other one that there were two different floating balls with eyeballs, right?

641
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:47,730
Speaker 0: The red one and the fleshy colored one in old doom.

642
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,030
Speaker 0: And now there's only one kind, the Caco demon, which is, I guess.

643
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:52,459
Speaker 0: Okay.

644
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:52,930
Speaker 1: Yeah.

645
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,850
Speaker 1: You're thinking of the, Oh, what's the, what's that guy called?

646
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:59,010
Speaker 1: The, uh, there's the fleshy one and there's the red one shoots out the skull guys.

647
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:04,123
Speaker 0: One of them is the Caco demon and one of them's not pain element, pain elemental is the one that shoots out.

648
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:09,744
Speaker 0: Pain elemental is not in this game, but there are floating fire skulls that are just on their own.

649
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:16,730
Speaker 0: Uh, but anyway, it's, you know, each bad guy was great about them is that each one has to be defeated in an interesting way.

650
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,129
Speaker 0: It's like, sure.

651
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:25,590
Speaker 0: You could beat any one of the guys just by shooting them a ton and the BFG will kill obviously anything, but each guy has a really efficient way of killing them.

652
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:31,270
Speaker 0: So like to beat pinky, the best thing to do is get behind him and shoot him and he'll go down easy and other guys are going to easy.

653
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:39,230
Speaker 0: We shoot him in the head and other guys would go down easy if you shoot him like, you know, in a certain spot with plasma and other guys would go down easy to a shotgun.

654
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:41,109
Speaker 0: It's like each guy has an easy way to get them.

655
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:50,009
Speaker 0: So it's like you have to really, you know, like recognize guys, switch weapons, move and fight each guy.

656
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:55,590
Speaker 0: When there's a bunch of different guys coming at you all mixed up, you have to, you know, get some interesting strategies going on.

657
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,389
Speaker 0: Like, well, just dodge that guy, kill that one first, that sort of thing.

658
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:07,090
Speaker 0: It also has this mechanic where if a guy's hurt a bunch, but not dead yet, oh yeah, you can do the gore thing.

659
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:12,710
Speaker 0: You can push a button to kill them in a gory and I guess melee fashion.

660
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,430
Speaker 0: It's a weird jarring experience.

661
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:20,409
Speaker 1: Like you sort of like shoot forward and have this weird gory squeaky like play experience and then you shoot back.

662
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:29,207
Speaker 0: I got an upgrade that increased the range on it, which made it even weirder because like I'd be kind of far away from a guy and I'd push a button and suddenly I'd be like ripping his head off.

663
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:36,430
Speaker 1: Like it's weirdly immersive and jarring, but not as just like, it doesn't mess you up.

664
00:41:36,631 --> 00:41:41,958
Speaker 0: Like you're like normally it's like, I'll just shoot all the guys, but hey, if you do that, you lose an ammo and be.

665
00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:44,210
Speaker 0: when you do this to a guy, you get health and stuff.

666
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:44,533
Speaker 0: Yeah.

667
00:41:44,694 --> 00:41:46,509
Speaker 0: So it's like you want to do it if you can.

668
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:52,589
Speaker 0: The other thing is they got the chainsaw, which is a doom classic, but the chainsaw works in a weird way.

669
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:56,510
Speaker 0: It's not, it doesn't come up when you choose your weapons normally.

670
00:41:57,371 --> 00:42:00,130
Speaker 0: Neither does the BFG, I guess to prevent you from using it by accident.

671
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:01,055
Speaker 0: Yeah.

672
00:42:01,377 --> 00:42:03,690
Speaker 0: And when you use the chainsaw, you use fuel.

673
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:05,395
Speaker 0: And what happens?

674
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:12,530
Speaker 0: if you use the chainsaw on a bad guy, you will kill it in an awesome chainsaw way, no matter what, as long as you have enough fuel for that bad guy.

675
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,750
Speaker 0: You, I've even killed like Baron of Hell, a chainsaw, as long as I had a ton of fuel.

676
00:42:16,651 --> 00:42:23,269
Speaker 0: But once you kill a guy with the chainsaw, uh, you get, it just spills a fountain of ammo like everywhere.

677
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:24,850
Speaker 1: So it's interesting.

678
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:26,409
Speaker 1: I couldn't figure out how to use the stupid chainsaw.

679
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,810
Speaker 0: It has a specific button to bring it out.

680
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,031
Speaker 1: Yeah.

681
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:30,849
Speaker 1: So I picked it up and I was like, oh, I can't select it.

682
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:33,989
Speaker 1: So then I thought, oh, maybe it's an item like my frag grenade, but then it wasn't.

683
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:34,331
Speaker 0: No.

684
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:35,015
Speaker 0: Yeah.

685
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:37,230
Speaker 0: I didn't use, I barely use a lot of the game.

686
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,110
Speaker 1: And until Scott came over to the show tonight, I didn't know how to use the chainsaw.

687
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,549
Speaker 0: It has its own button to bring it out.

688
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,648
Speaker 0: It's not a regular weapon.

689
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,870
Speaker 0: That's why same thing with doing a job of telling me that same thing with BFG.

690
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:47,450
Speaker 0: No, I had to look it up in the options.

691
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,610
Speaker 1: I pointedly, the way I played this game is I decided it's a doom game.

692
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:51,910
Speaker 1: Fuck it balls out.

693
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,270
Speaker 0: I'm just going and going and going and going and going and going and going.

694
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:55,189
Speaker 0: That's what I did too.

695
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,389
Speaker 0: Except I also, uh, lingered around and found secrets.

696
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:02,210
Speaker 1: I found a lot of secrets because it does the thing that doom did.

697
00:43:02,351 --> 00:43:03,910
Speaker 1: That's why it's like the secrets.

698
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:09,410
Speaker 0: The thing is doom was all about secrets, but the secrets in this doom or half-life two style secrets.

699
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:13,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're not doing that or told the way doom was.

700
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:18,890
Speaker 1: Cause the way doom would have a lot of secrets would be like, you'd see like a glint of a blue armor.

701
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,513
Speaker 1: Yup.

702
00:43:19,734 --> 00:43:21,890
Speaker 1: And you'd be like, how the fuck do I get in there?

703
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,456
Speaker 0: That's right.

704
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,408
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

705
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:24,113
Speaker 0: Yup.

706
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,169
Speaker 0: That's how it does.

707
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,210
Speaker 1: But what it doesn't do, at least it hasn't done to me yet.

708
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:32,530
Speaker 1: Is the classic thing that doom two would do all the time.

709
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,915
Speaker 1: It was like a hallmark of game design would be.

710
00:43:35,335 --> 00:43:42,250
Speaker 1: you'd go through an area and that would set up triggers to where on your way back, like shit would happen behind you.

711
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,129
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of backtracking.

712
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:46,409
Speaker 0: There's maybe some, but not too much.

713
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:52,030
Speaker 1: Like you do a thing and then like behind you, a door silently opens and like four bears out, come out.

714
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:52,478
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

715
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,050
Speaker 1: Like that stuff.

716
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,829
Speaker 0: The game does a little bit of that, but not a lot.

717
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:58,990
Speaker 1: Like I, because I'm doing like, I was obsessed with doom.

718
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:02,790
Speaker 1: Like I got doomed to like memorize, uh, this game.

719
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:06,004
Speaker 1: I expected a lot of terrifying things to happen.

720
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:07,310
Speaker 1: that did not happen so far.

721
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,609
Speaker 0: Well, have you gone to hell yet?

722
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,690
Speaker 1: Well, no, I'm just on Mars still.

723
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,109
Speaker 0: It's a little more terrifying in hell.

724
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:12,811
Speaker 1: Yeah.

725
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:16,010
Speaker 1: But like doom two, that shit started like in level four.

726
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,350
Speaker 0: It's not, yeah, it doesn't happen as much.

727
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,001
Speaker 0: Uh, also you play it on harder difficulties.

728
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:22,729
Speaker 0: that happens more, but good luck getting there.

729
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,369
Speaker 1: I'm laying it on a hurt me plenty right now.

730
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,510
Speaker 1: I also was hurt plenty, but I'm going to try it in debt.

731
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,590
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to like have a decent way through the game.

732
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:36,310
Speaker 1: I might just start over on a ultra violence and see how it goes a little bit of the ultra violence.

733
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:37,592
Speaker 0: Yeah.

734
00:44:38,495 --> 00:44:43,350
Speaker 0: Uh, the other thing that this game has, which other dooms did have, people just didn't pay attention is a plot.

735
00:44:44,552 --> 00:44:47,390
Speaker 0: It's a really thin plot, but it's a doom plot.

736
00:44:47,591 --> 00:44:48,255
Speaker 0: Yeah.

737
00:44:48,678 --> 00:44:50,250
Speaker 1: And it also presents the plot.

738
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,790
Speaker 0: The thing is the plot of the original doom was just about as thin.

739
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,869
Speaker 0: It just wasn't presented so overtly.

740
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,296
Speaker 0: So you would miss it.

741
00:44:57,357 --> 00:44:58,870
Speaker 1: purely environmental storytelling, right?

742
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:01,156
Speaker 0: It was environmental and also a little bit of text.

743
00:45:01,217 --> 00:45:05,730
Speaker 0: when you started one of the episodes, like the original doom, even do one had a plot.

744
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:18,390
Speaker 0: It's just people didn't know it because they didn't read it and they didn't pay attention and they didn't sort of figure out like, oh, first he's in the base and then he gets overrun and then he goes to hell and then his way out of hell portal open.

745
00:45:18,531 --> 00:45:20,390
Speaker 0: It's like that plot was in the original doom.

746
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,751
Speaker 0: It's just.

747
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:25,869
Speaker 0: you couldn't, you had to like look for it to see it there and fully understand what a dude is like.

748
00:45:26,252 --> 00:45:28,350
Speaker 1: We have play God in this one.

749
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,310
Speaker 0: This dude is just telling you the plot.

750
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:44,085
Speaker 0: It's just like everything is just told to you, but it's basically the same plot as the original doom with the obvious exception of, uh, yeah, you're the doom guy brought back for more doom as opposed to you are.

751
00:45:44,145 --> 00:45:48,230
Speaker 0: now, you know, you're just a guy, a space Marine and you are become doom.

752
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:48,710
Speaker 0: Guy,

753
00:45:50,713 --> 00:45:51,994
Speaker 1: but the way

754
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:52,054
Speaker 0: it

755
00:45:52,775 --> 00:46:07,570
Speaker 1: does that is sort of interesting because it's a little bit deconstructive or a little bit parody in that it'll start to do a half life thing, but like a little casino start, but it'll do it in this almost like desultory fashion and like doom guys.

756
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:14,470
Speaker 1: Response will be to punch the monitor halfway through the dialogue and ended and just continue like that kind of stuff happens a lot.

757
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,530
Speaker 0: Doom guy doesn't give a fuck.

758
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,909
Speaker 0: He just wants to shoot them demons.

759
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:19,770
Speaker 1: Like the thing that like lets you upgrade your shit.

760
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:26,790
Speaker 1: The way you interact with it is it starts to like do a thing and you just fucking punch it in the face and pull the upgrade out of it and keep going.

761
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,830
Speaker 0: He's just, he's doomed guy.

762
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:28,410
Speaker 0: I didn't give a fuck.

763
00:46:28,592 --> 00:46:29,290
Speaker 0: He's supposed to kill demons.

764
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:29,630
Speaker 0: Yeah.

765
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:31,224
Speaker 0: Also, it's got a lot of hell.

766
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:32,824
Speaker 0: I'm going to shoot it.

767
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:35,090
Speaker 0: It was a point at which I don't know if he got there.

768
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:45,350
Speaker 0: I don't remember when it was in the game where the guy who's like the character who just tells you everything, the certain narrator, the cyborg guy, the guy who you're not sure if is good or bad and he's probably both or whatever.

769
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:48,349
Speaker 0: He's like, Oh, you seem to like guns.

770
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:56,950
Speaker 1: You'll find something to your liking over there, but like you only ever interact with the environment by hitting your use button.

771
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:57,969
Speaker 1: Very doom style.

772
00:46:58,313 --> 00:46:59,709
Speaker 0: And it just does whatever it's going to do.

773
00:46:59,871 --> 00:47:00,929
Speaker 0: You don't, there's not a lot of choice.

774
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,690
Speaker 1: It does it in kind of a funny way.

775
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:09,100
Speaker 1: Like sometimes like here's the switch, it may look different and do a crazy thing, but it is just the switch to continue the plot

776
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:12,245
Speaker 0: and you might kick it or just touch it or like early

777
00:47:12,265 --> 00:47:15,330
Speaker 1: on in the game you go to the control room and like you see a switch.

778
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:22,130
Speaker 1: And you hit use on it and it like doesn't do anything, but then there's this dead body like laying next to it and the dead bodies highlighted.

779
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:32,810
Speaker 1: Like you can use it and if you hit use on that doom guy reaches down, holds up the dead guy's arm, shoves it on the control panel and that activates the switch and you don't have to, it's no puzzle.

780
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:40,470
Speaker 1: The puzzle, there's no puzzle to solve there, but it has the trappings of what in another Megaman, Megaman style FPS would have been a puzzle.

781
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has.

782
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,089
Speaker 0: It's like, it's not really a puzzle or a maze, but it's like joke.

783
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:52,270
Speaker 0: It's, it's like there's a lot of parts that like would be amazed, but they didn't make it complex enough where you could actually get lost, right?

784
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,010
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like, oh, I'm doing a maze just like original doom games, ha ha ha.

785
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,130
Speaker 0: But it's like, no, actually it's just like two corners.

786
00:48:00,274 --> 00:48:00,848
Speaker 0: There it is.

787
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,769
Speaker 0: It's not really a place you're going to get lost in like real doom.

788
00:48:04,153 --> 00:48:04,348
Speaker 0: Sorry.

789
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,909
Speaker 0: It's, we didn't make a real maze cause that would take too long.

790
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:12,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even then it's still closer to, cause dooms mazes were not really mazes either.

791
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:15,490
Speaker 1: They were just funneling you through the monster fights.

792
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,190
Speaker 0: Wolfenstein was a maze, right?

793
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:21,650
Speaker 0: Everything got less mazy over time, but this newer doom is the least mazy.

794
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,930
Speaker 1: I feel like the old, like Hexen was more mazy, but I don't really remember that clearly.

795
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:30,130
Speaker 0: Not as mazy as Wolfenstein, which was a literal rectangular maze, you get fucking lost.

796
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:37,609
Speaker 1: Well, the doom engines big, like big thing move forward other than the 2.5D was that walls could be at any angle, not just 90 degrees.

797
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,150
Speaker 0: I mean, that is one nice part.

798
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:43,470
Speaker 1: The side deaths or whatever the sectors, the line deaths.

799
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:44,403
Speaker 0: This is real 3d.

800
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:49,970
Speaker 0: So you got a lot of, you know, interesting ways to hide secrets and maze bits by going up and down.

801
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:53,761
Speaker 0: And you think, well, it didn't quake do all that, but actually quake.

802
00:48:53,781 --> 00:48:56,990
Speaker 0: single players, garbage compared to old doom or new doom.

803
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:03,330
Speaker 1: Cause quake and quake two single player were basically, we made a multiplayer game, but there is technically a single player game here.

804
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,590
Speaker 0: Here's a bunch of garbage levels you never want to play.

805
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:06,039
Speaker 0: Yup.

806
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:07,349
Speaker 1: I don't know.

807
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,170
Speaker 1: I like this game though.

808
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:12,249
Speaker 1: Like it's, it's, I don't know if you want to pay full price price for it necessarily.

809
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:13,090
Speaker 0: Yeah.

810
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:18,190
Speaker 0: I paid full price just because I really wanted to play a single player FPS and it was the best one around.

811
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:21,630
Speaker 1: But like, it was very telling that I play Overwatch a lot.

812
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:27,010
Speaker 1: It's and Counter-Strike again, it's very hard to pull me away from those like competitive modern games.

813
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:31,689
Speaker 1: But then I sat down to play this game to do the show and I just kept playing it.

814
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:35,510
Speaker 1: Like I just kept playing it the way I would when I was in high school.

815
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,790
Speaker 1: I only stopped because I noticed it was like midnight and I had to go to bed.

816
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:47,970
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, I wouldn't pay the, you know, the 50 bucks or whatever because it's the kind of game where I play, I beat it and I put it on the shelf and I'm done.

817
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:48,378
Speaker 0: Yup.

818
00:49:49,110 --> 00:50:00,290
Speaker 0: But if this comes down in the steam sale, like 20 or less, and you want to, you like single player FPSs and you like doom, you should get this game if your computer can play it.

819
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,420
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

Speaker 1: It is a testament to the pipeline I set up that this is the new computer.

830
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:32,844
Speaker 1: I didn't have to change anything.

831
00:51:32,944 --> 00:51:35,168
Speaker 1: My mixer is digital.

832
00:51:35,368 --> 00:51:36,591
Speaker 1: The Firewire card worked.

833
00:51:37,412 --> 00:51:41,960
Speaker 1: I literally just took the template from the old computer and used it on the new computer and it seems like it worked.

834
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:48,940
Speaker 1: I'm about to actually edit the episode together so you'll find out in the forum thread if things did not go according to plan.
