1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,133
Speaker 2: Are we good?

2
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:10,236
Speaker 2: Is it working?

3
00:00:10,336 --> 00:00:10,858
Speaker 1: That's working fine.

4
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:11,661
Speaker 1: Is everyone working?

5
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:12,684
Speaker 1: Yes, everyone's working fine.

6
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:13,266
Speaker 2: Okay, you ready?

7
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:14,390
Speaker 0: One time I saw a goose.

8
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:19,218
Speaker 1: So we're here, we're here with Conrad Kraling.

9
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:20,562
Speaker 1: Many of you may know him from the internet.

10
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:23,330
Speaker 2: Yeah, our fans, it seems it's weird.

11
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:31,650
Speaker 2: It's like people are, I guess they listen to our show and they say they're our fans, even though I tell them not to listen to our show, but all they want to hear on our show is people who aren't us.

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,694
Speaker 1: Huh?

13
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:37,710
Speaker 2: People who are on the show only once, like, you know, a separate weird situation.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:44,752
Speaker 1: If I had a listener not that long ago at an event, say, wait a minute, you know, Conrad, the guy from Johnny Wander?

15
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:45,213
Speaker 2: Yeah.

16
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,604
Speaker 2: People will be like, oh man, the best episodes of Geek Nights.

17
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:55,240
Speaker 2: How about, you know, fast karate for the Geek Nights, the one they always say is the food episodes.

18
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:56,022
Speaker 1: Okay.

19
00:00:56,082 --> 00:00:57,024
Speaker 1: We should do a show on food.

20
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:57,425
Speaker 1: Sure.

21
00:00:57,786 --> 00:01:01,376
Speaker 2: But anyway, so by popular demand, we have brought back.

22
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:05,230
Speaker 1: So Conrad, the corn bed, we've heard that you've seen a ghost.

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,116
Speaker 0: Well, one time I did in fact see a ghost.

24
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:08,858
Speaker 0: What was it like?

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:09,781
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

26
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:15,796
Speaker 0: You see, I was, I was trapped in a dungeon after an entire year of imprisonment.

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,900
Speaker 0: I spent it with a dragon.

28
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:25,159
Speaker 0: Finally, I escaped on a rowboat and after about a year of drifting on the sea, I finally regained feeling in my legs.

29
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:26,623
Speaker 2: Okay.

30
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:36,827
Speaker 1: So I think Emily didn't realize until recently that every time you said that you were referencing this, this thing that we're all, she knew the thing that you were referencing, but she didn't realize that the seeing a ghost was a reference to that thing.

31
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:37,871
Speaker 0: Oh no, it's, it's perfect.

32
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:44,932
Speaker 1: It is because when you reminded me of the dragon was when you put it in the bio, you gave me for our PAX dev panel.

33
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:45,354
Speaker 2: It was dead.

34
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:46,036
Speaker 2: That was on.

35
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:48,804
Speaker 1: And you emailed me too.

36
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:49,887
Speaker 1: You were like, is it okay?

37
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:50,950
Speaker 1: And I was like, yeah, sure.

38
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:52,273
Speaker 1: And I went for it.

39
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:53,737
Speaker 1: I put it up and it's in the book.

40
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:58,673
Speaker 2: You could, anyone can get the PAX dev 2012 program and see it says right there, Conrad.

41
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:00,819
Speaker 1: It's like wearing an Ogloff shirt.

42
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,489
Speaker 1: People who know, know, and nobody else is the wiser.

43
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,347
Speaker 0: I should note that I also use that exact same bio for the mobile gaming summit bio I had to submit.

44
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,296
Speaker 0: And that is an industry professional like situation.

45
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:14,542
Speaker 0: I had never been happier because they printed it.

46
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:15,024
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

47
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:16,087
Speaker 0: They printed it.

48
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:17,030
Speaker 0: I tweeted it.

49
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,196
Speaker 0: I was like, this is the happiest day of my entire life.

50
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:25,675
Speaker 2: I'm so happy that I got a reference to, do we know who the guy is who actually made the song?

51
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:26,157
Speaker 0: Yeah.

52
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:26,578
Speaker 0: Yeah.

53
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:27,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

54
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,545
Speaker 2: Can we like, uh, get him on the show?

55
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:30,428
Speaker 0: Probably.

56
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:32,173
Speaker 0: I would love to shake his hand with gloves on.

57
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:37,513
Speaker 1: We should say something much more important that our friend Kate usually yells at us for stupid shit on the internet.

58
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,539
Speaker 1: She is the one who showed us the dragon.

59
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,222
Speaker 2: Exactly.

60
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:41,626
Speaker 1: So it is her fault.

61
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:43,893
Speaker 2: But yet she'd probably complain if you brought it up.

62
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:47,581
Speaker 1: No, she would probably say probably.

63
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,664
Speaker 1: Okay.

64
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:55,102
Speaker 1: So you might remember years ago we were doing a profiles and geek and then we kind of forgot to keep doing those,

65
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:56,707
Speaker 2: but now we're going to keep doing them

66
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:59,861
Speaker 1: because Conrad's here and we didn't want to talk about cell phones again, even

67
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:02,793
Speaker 2: though everyone wants to hear about cell phones, it's just the same shit over and over again.

68
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:03,315
Speaker 1: It's easy.

69
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:04,419
Speaker 1: Buy an iPhone.

70
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,148
Speaker 1: If you don't want an iPhone, buy the old nexus S.

71
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,094
Speaker 0: well, you can buy the nexus as the nexus.

72
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:09,736
Speaker 0: This is a pilot.

73
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,542
Speaker 2: You can get the next song nexus.

74
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,646
Speaker 0: Yes, the Samsung nexus.

75
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:16,217
Speaker 2: It's disgusting for, but it's gigantic in other ways.

76
00:03:16,258 --> 00:03:17,842
Speaker 2: It's good, but it's sold out.

77
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:24,362
Speaker 2: But I point out that the majority, look, I'm limiting the cell phone discussion to three minutes.

78
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:25,345
Speaker 1: Look at my monitor here.

79
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,572
Speaker 1: This is Dell ultra sharp with a proper color gamut.

80
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:34,973
Speaker 1: The majority of people in the world don't know or care and they'll buy a monitor that costs a quarter as much and say it looks better.

81
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:40,469
Speaker 1: Do you think any of those people need a better screen than this screen on my nexus?

82
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,961
Speaker 0: I refuse to give money to any company that ships pentile matrix.

83
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:49,642
Speaker 2: It's a question of whether it's, you know, but you know, if it's better for you, but do you know it's better for you?

84
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,830
Speaker 1: So when I tweeted about that, I tweeted something.

85
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,644
Speaker 1: I was like, nobody really understands color gamut and they showed blah, blah, blah.

86
00:03:56,005 --> 00:04:08,260
Speaker 1: And there's a Twitter account dedicated to color gamuts and they retweeted me and they emailed me and they were like, you are one of the few people in the world who understands what we care about.

87
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:17,548
Speaker 0: I will, I will go on record as saying that a non tech just did the write up of the nexus for, and the nexus for is this beautiful panel that has not been calibrated at all.

88
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,603
Speaker 0: They did not calibrate it in the factory and they sold out like crazy though.

89
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:27,281
Speaker 0: And a non tech was like, they didn't even, it's not even touched like the nexus for is just, it's gigantic.

90
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:27,602
Speaker 0: Huge.

91
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,083
Speaker 0: Yeah.

92
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:32,977
Speaker 1: If it was this size or a smaller, I'd probably consider it my Palm pre a little while ago.

93
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:36,066
Speaker 2: Cause I have a small, it's the best size.

94
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:36,889
Speaker 1: It's thick though.

95
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,190
Speaker 1: Yeah.

96
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,193
Speaker 2: It doesn't matter.

97
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:43,531
Speaker 1: It has a physical keyboard, which while I still kind of miss physical keyboards, I'm done with physical keyboards.

98
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:44,134
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably.

99
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:44,976
Speaker 2: It's nobody.

100
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:48,268
Speaker 1: There's very few people still type faster on my pre than I can.

101
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,733
Speaker 2: You guys have one minute left on this.

102
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:50,576
Speaker 0: I'm done.

103
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:51,359
Speaker 1: Okay.

104
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,001
Speaker 1: All right.

105
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:52,984
Speaker 1: So what about Google glasses?

106
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:54,349
Speaker 2: They're not coming out yet.

107
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:54,891
Speaker 1: They will someday.

108
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,596
Speaker 1: Did you see that new game ingress?

109
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:57,498
Speaker 2: Yeah.

110
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,203
Speaker 2: If you have an Android phone, get it.

111
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:01,790
Speaker 1: But no, it's a closed beta.

112
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:02,271
Speaker 2: Yeah.

113
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,577
Speaker 2: Well, if you'd got to get in the beta.

114
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:04,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, I tried.

115
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,470
Speaker 1: I even tried to pull rank and be like, do you know who I am?

116
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,752
Speaker 1: Google doesn't.

117
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:08,515
Speaker 2: Yeah.

118
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:08,856
Speaker 2: Google.

119
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:09,559
Speaker 2: Do you know who I am?

120
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,212
Speaker 2: Some guy who uses our fucking thing and doesn't even give a bunch of people at Google.

121
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:17,604
Speaker 1: And that has worked before it's got, I got us into some, some of our early con.

122
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:22,157
Speaker 2: I got the fucking CR 38 Chromebook thing and I don't even use it.

123
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:25,587
Speaker 1: I got some of our earliest con gigs by pulling the, do you know who I am?

124
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:26,410
Speaker 2: Sure.

125
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,216
Speaker 2: Anyway, let us move on.

126
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:29,540
Speaker 1: That was when I wasn't even anyone.

127
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,531
Speaker 2: Are we going to do news and things a day or are we going to do those later?

128
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:32,892
Speaker 2: That.

129
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:33,413
Speaker 2: Okay.

130
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:34,556
Speaker 1: So let us.

131
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:34,957
Speaker 1: Thursday.

132
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:35,779
Speaker 1: It's the lounge.

133
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,245
Speaker 2: So let us profile the Conrad.

134
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:40,751
Speaker 2: So the Conrad, we met you in the college.

135
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:41,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

136
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:45,902
Speaker 2: We know very vague details of your pre-college.

137
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:47,566
Speaker 0: Oh wow.

138
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:47,927
Speaker 0: Okay.

139
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:52,357
Speaker 1: Um, our listeners don't even know about our pre-college.

140
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:53,300
Speaker 0: It's weird.

141
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,245
Speaker 0: My family moved all around New York state.

142
00:05:55,325 --> 00:06:02,787
Speaker 0: So I used to, I was born in Buffalo, but my family immediately moved as far North and as far East in New York state as you can go to base in Canada.

143
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:03,429
Speaker 0: Yeah.

144
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:06,037
Speaker 0: On the Canada, Vermont, New York border on the New York side.

145
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:06,418
Speaker 0: Okay.

146
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,465
Speaker 0: It was in this tiny town called Rouse's point.

147
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:21,197
Speaker 0: And, um, some of my fondest memories, uh, as a child, we're going into with my father into Canada for beer, Vermont for gas, and then back home where he would make me pancakes every Saturday.

148
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,927
Speaker 0: And this was like a really like formative memory I had.

149
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,930
Speaker 0: It was, it was awesome.

150
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,735
Speaker 2: And I could definitely identify with that.

151
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:28,116
Speaker 2: That's good.

152
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:28,417
Speaker 0: And so.

153
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:32,951
Speaker 0: when I was nine though, we moved to Lancaster, New York, a suburb of Buffalo.

154
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:42,195
Speaker 0: Um, which is, I think now why I could never imagine living in the suburbs ever again, like suburban wasteland sort of doesn't even begin to describe it.

155
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:47,113
Speaker 0: Like we had to take the bus 45 minutes to get to the mall, which was the most exciting thing available to us.

156
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:54,698
Speaker 1: You know, it's interesting because suburbs in the Midwest, especially like Southeast Michigan, North, like Northern Ohio are not like that.

157
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:55,320
Speaker 1: There's sub.

158
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,263
Speaker 1: they're suburbs, right?

159
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:58,671
Speaker 1: The same kind of thing you were living in, but they're so dense.

160
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,496
Speaker 1: There's a grocery store, like every mile.

161
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:02,703
Speaker 1: I live near the grocery store.

162
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:06,174
Speaker 1: It's like five minutes in any direction from my house, my house.

163
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,619
Speaker 2: I grew up in which my parents still live in.

164
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:14,882
Speaker 2: You could walk to the mall or the grocery store, but you know, now having lived in the city, I cannot tolerate being not in a city.

165
00:07:14,982 --> 00:07:16,246
Speaker 1: I can't tolerate very long.

166
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:19,816
Speaker 1: I was talking to some of your friends, Conrad, at the party last night.

167
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:24,069
Speaker 1: And we were talking about like, imagine going to a restaurant in a car.

168
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:28,878
Speaker 0: Imagine if you needed milk, you have to get into the car.

169
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:29,580
Speaker 0: Yeah.

170
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:31,225
Speaker 1: What now to me, a car?

171
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:35,859
Speaker 1: actually, now that I don't need a car anymore, getting into a car is like this mystery time.

172
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,464
Speaker 1: Like, Oh my God, we're going somewhere.

173
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:37,745
Speaker 1: Yeah.

174
00:07:37,846 --> 00:07:39,130
Speaker 0: I feel like a dog, right?

175
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,511
Speaker 0: I'm sure.

176
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:41,413
Speaker 0: I'm so excited.

177
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:44,378
Speaker 0: It's embarrassing.

178
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:50,229
Speaker 2: So being someone who lived in the stakes, how did you become all nerdy and technology?

179
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:51,131
Speaker 1: How'd you get your nerd on?

180
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:51,653
Speaker 0: Okay.

181
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:55,144
Speaker 0: So I mentioned that I lived up in this very small town called Rouse's Point.

182
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:59,278
Speaker 0: Despite it being a very small town, my father was very in line with the tech community there.

183
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,432
Speaker 0: So one of his best friends, John Rigby, actually ran a bulletin board system.

184
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:04,414
Speaker 0: Whoa.

185
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:08,527
Speaker 0: I was on, I was on BBSs when I was like four and five and it was a big, I didn't realize.

186
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:09,470
Speaker 2: What kind of computer did you have then?

187
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:12,295
Speaker 0: I believe it was a 386 at that time.

188
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:12,716
Speaker 0: All right.

189
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:13,117
Speaker 0: Wow.

190
00:08:13,177 --> 00:08:15,342
Speaker 1: My first computer was a 486 SX.

191
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:15,824
Speaker 0: Yeah.

192
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,209
Speaker 0: Well, we, I missed the 486 line.

193
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:18,590
Speaker 0: We had that 386.

194
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,183
Speaker 2: The first computer that was in my house that wasn't a video game console was a 486, a hundred megahertz.

195
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:30,278
Speaker 0: So yeah, it was a, and you know, I used to like dial in with all those mysterious pro modem protocols.

196
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:31,180
Speaker 0: It had those funny names.

197
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:34,428
Speaker 0: We only had the one phone line.

198
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:41,304
Speaker 0: So despite the fact that I had, cause back in the day, BBSs, you would have metered a lot of time that you could be on to dial in.

199
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:46,073
Speaker 1: I went to, I used to go to this pirate BBS where you could download, download basically pirated versions of games.

200
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:47,636
Speaker 0: Oh, every BBS.

201
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:52,404
Speaker 1: But I had to, you had to donate money to them, like by mailing them a check.

202
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:52,885
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

203
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:54,287
Speaker 1: And then you would get oxygen.

204
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:56,651
Speaker 1: And it was, it was, it was at this underwater.

205
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,535
Speaker 1: Were they running space trade around there?

206
00:08:58,595 --> 00:08:59,497
Speaker 1: It was the underwater theme.

207
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:02,925
Speaker 1: And if you ran out of oxygen, you couldn't download any more stuff.

208
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:04,829
Speaker 1: And the analogy really didn't work.

209
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:05,170
Speaker 1: that well.

210
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:05,530
Speaker 2: No.

211
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:07,013
Speaker 0: Yeah.

212
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:11,802
Speaker 0: So I had unlimited time on it and it had red dragon, of course, like every BBS.

213
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:13,224
Speaker 0: And I spent a lot of time on that.

214
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:14,747
Speaker 2: So that's the year you spent with the dragon.

215
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,149
Speaker 0: That was my year with the dragon.

216
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,390
Speaker 0: Yeah.

217
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,352
Speaker 1: Bringing it back around.

218
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:21,396
Speaker 0: So, so that was, uh, those, uh, that was sort of my nerdy history.

219
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,659
Speaker 0: Otherwise my father always had computers around the house.

220
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,466
Speaker 0: I was doing basic when I was, you know, in kindergarten and, uh, I sort of just stuck with it.

221
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,850
Speaker 0: because I mean, why not looking back on it?

222
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,142
Speaker 0: Like it's really easy to look at that period of time and be, you know, like, wow, how did I, I was just using windows 95 all those years.

223
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:39,486
Speaker 0: Like it's sort of a miracle thinking back on it.

224
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,330
Speaker 0: Hey, that we moved forward as a race.

225
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:41,570
Speaker 0: Yeah.

226
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,324
Speaker 2: It's like, I use like windows seven today and it doesn't, you know, and it's like one part of my brain is like, this isn't any different than windows 95.

227
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:48,546
Speaker 2: But then I look at windows 95 and I'm like, what?

228
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:50,510
Speaker 2: Yeah.

229
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:53,610
Speaker 1: Remember when plug and play, what didn't even always work?

230
00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:09,170
Speaker 0: Well, we, we referred to it as plug and pray at the time, sort of jokingly, but you know, yeah, like it's really easy to look back on those times in my opinion and, and sort of marvel at how anti-competitive everything was and how very, it was like, well, if you need a computer, you have one choice, you go to the store and you buy a compact.

231
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,150
Speaker 1: I remember I tried to go to gateway and I really wanted windows NT and they wouldn't sell it to me.

232
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:15,470
Speaker 0: Yeah.

233
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:21,503
Speaker 0: And there was like that, that Ray of sunlight that windows 2000 was, it was like, Oh, this is what a real multi-user operating system is like.

234
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,810
Speaker 2: But like, you know, obviously I didn't get that until I got to fucking RIT.

235
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:25,997
Speaker 1: Yeah.

236
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:27,850
Speaker 1: I had windows 2000 before I went to RIT.

237
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:29,850
Speaker 2: I used 98 SE for a long time.

238
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,276
Speaker 1: Because I cashed in all the bonds my grandparents gave me.

239
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:37,630
Speaker 1: And I bought that AMD K7 800 with windows 2000.

240
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,649
Speaker 0: I bought a via chip.

241
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:41,670
Speaker 2: Oh, you and, you and Greg Hartman.

242
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,414
Speaker 0: I bought, I bought it with money that I made from my paper route.

243
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:47,760
Speaker 0: And, uh, I saved up for months to get this, this via chip.

244
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,389
Speaker 0: And I was so excited about having enough money to buy the via chip that I actually didn't have enough money to buy a motherboard, but it didn't matter.

245
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:54,090
Speaker 0: I was just excited.

246
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:01,546
Speaker 2: I saved up a thousand dollars working at the dry cleaners in high school and I bought a Pentium three 450 with a TNT two.

247
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:03,330
Speaker 2: I bought the TNT two the day it came out.

248
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,229
Speaker 0: Did you remember when a CPU slotted in?

249
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,289
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a slot.

250
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,395
Speaker 1: Well, they were sockets.

251
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,649
Speaker 1: Then they went to slots and then back to sockets.

252
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:11,393
Speaker 0: Yeah.

253
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,390
Speaker 2: I never understood what the point of the slot was.

254
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:19,230
Speaker 1: The point of the slot was that because you had more space on that board, you could put a shit ton of like L3 cash on there.

255
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:21,850
Speaker 0: And it was actually thinking about the layout of a board.

256
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,364
Speaker 2: You could probably, and it would still be, it would still be standard, I guess.

257
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:25,670
Speaker 2: Yeah.

258
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,352
Speaker 1: Basically.

259
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:26,512
Speaker 1: Yeah.

260
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,375
Speaker 1: You'd have more space on the, on the board.

261
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:29,999
Speaker 1: You'd have more space.

262
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:36,010
Speaker 1: You could put a bunch of memory in there, like caches and stuff, more L2 L3, which before then only existed on motherboards.

263
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,783
Speaker 2: I think it was a lot easier to put a computer together because you didn't have to deal with the fricking janky ass.

264
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:42,789
Speaker 2: lock it where you're going to destroy everything.

265
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:43,210
Speaker 1: I read.

266
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:54,250
Speaker 1: The only reason that we went back to sockets was that the chip, by only having this edge connection, it just, there was a limited number of pins and a limited amount of bandwidth and the physical distance started to matter.

267
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:54,550
Speaker 2: Yeah.

268
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,321
Speaker 2: Well now the new thing they come up with is the pins are on the motherboard and the contacts on the chip.

269
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:03,090
Speaker 2: And apparently that like reduces some heat or so it's like apparently way better.

270
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:08,440
Speaker 0: I mean, if you think about it, it makes the chips like more physically reliable if nothing else.

271
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,641
Speaker 0: Right.

272
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,965
Speaker 0: We've all, we've all been to pin on a, an Athlon.

273
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,229
Speaker 0: Let's be fair to anybody who has done that.

274
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,993
Speaker 0: So, so I think the move back makes a lot of sense.

275
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:18,574
Speaker 0: I think it's smart.

276
00:12:18,594 --> 00:12:18,914
Speaker 0: Of course.

277
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:22,038
Speaker 0: Um, I'm very excited about building my, my next computer.

278
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:31,770
Speaker 0: Um, I have it all specked out, but I, I'm like really sort of nervous because Ivy bridge is very good, but everything I read about has, well, it's like land of milk and honey.

279
00:12:32,232 --> 00:12:33,978
Speaker 2: Because it's tick tock, right?

280
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:37,130
Speaker 2: So Ivy bridge was tick and the next one's going to be boom, big move.

281
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:45,225
Speaker 1: Every time I've ever researched a computer, I'll immediately see like, Oh, or there's a, you know, X millimeter process coming next.

282
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,570
Speaker 1: Oh, well, you know, there's always something next.

283
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:51,638
Speaker 0: Well, like let's take Nvidia cards, for example, Nvidia cards right now.

284
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:55,566
Speaker 0: The six 60 TI is this phenomenal piece of technology that I would have.

285
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:56,729
Speaker 0: no, I would throw it down for that today.

286
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:57,370
Speaker 0: I'll do it right now.

287
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,172
Speaker 2: I got a six 80.

288
00:12:58,172 --> 00:13:06,090
Speaker 0: it's crazy high roller, but I mean price performance, like that's, it's such a compelling value and it's so, you know, that's what Emily got.

289
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,333
Speaker 1: She's actually these computers.

290
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:13,146
Speaker 1: Emily's computer, my computer are identical, except she has a new video card and I still have my GTX two 60, two six.

291
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,131
Speaker 1: You know what?

292
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:16,335
Speaker 1: Does it fucking matter?

293
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,201
Speaker 1: Cause my computer is a fucking supercomputer.

294
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:21,070
Speaker 1: I can play counter-strike full FPS, NS two full FPS.

295
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:27,643
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I can play NS two full FPS, vertical sync at full resolution with fraps running.

296
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:28,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got vertical sync off.

297
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:30,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to upgrade.

298
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,654
Speaker 1: The reason I haven't upgraded is that settings.

299
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:35,741
Speaker 1: I want the mercury playback engine to work in.

300
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:40,290
Speaker 1: premiere premiere supports a list like 12.

301
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,202
Speaker 2: I enabled, even though I'm not on the list and it works, uh, it's probably not actually working.

302
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:47,167
Speaker 1: How did you enable it with the checkbox?

303
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:48,430
Speaker 1: That's not doing anything.

304
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:55,382
Speaker 1: If you're basically the premiere looks at a string to see if the string for your video card is in a list.

305
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:59,650
Speaker 1: Otherwise it does not enable GPU offloading of a automatic, like live rendering.

306
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:00,692
Speaker 1: All right.

307
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:01,434
Speaker 1: I'll send you a link.

308
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:07,848
Speaker 1: Basically you can add the string of your video card to the list and pretty much any video card after like a 300 series.

309
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,833
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure mine will do it.

310
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:15,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, well, but they, for some reason they won't certify it or whatever, but that is why it's supposed to be a Conrad.

311
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,418
Speaker 0: Well, I, Hey, I'm more than happy to talk about.

312
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:21,490
Speaker 0: I love this shit out of video cards because I do 3d graphics programming.

313
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,676
Speaker 0: Now I spend a lot of time limiting the video card conversation.

314
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:27,803
Speaker 0: I will say that Nvidia and AMD need to get their shit together.

315
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:30,950
Speaker 0: Whoever's writing their drivers needs to fucking step into high gear.

316
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:34,556
Speaker 1: All of our video drivers for a long time.

317
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,460
Speaker 1: They were awesome compared to any other.

318
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:41,790
Speaker 2: lately they're getting flaky because the competition has also always been flaky.

319
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:50,120
Speaker 0: An unnamed source of mine that used to work at Microsoft reported at one point that 50% of windows, blue screen, automatic file bug reports are caused by Nvidia drive.

320
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:58,770
Speaker 0: that I've been getting blue screens lately, you know, some of our user, our user, we get so many support emails that are like your game, blue screen, my computer, and it's too blue screen.

321
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,411
Speaker 2: And you know what?

322
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:06,141
Speaker 2: It happened when an onus was stomping, but it was, it was clearly because the video guy.

323
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:11,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but I mean, to a degree, like it's, it's kind of, um, for us, it's really frustrating because we're a small company.

324
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,172
Speaker 0: We want to treat our customers really well.

325
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,155
Speaker 0: And we're just constantly getting reports.

326
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:16,957
Speaker 0: It's like, well, I play every other game just fine.

327
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:17,538
Speaker 0: What is your game?

328
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:18,179
Speaker 0: Blue screen.

329
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,300
Speaker 2: That is a good question.

330
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,641
Speaker 1: You know what?

331
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:23,045
Speaker 1: The answer is, well, you probably don't actually play every other game just fine.

332
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:26,610
Speaker 2: You're probably made that one open GL call that no one else is making.

333
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,631
Speaker 0: Well, and it's unity too.

334
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:33,880
Speaker 0: The problem is since we do everything in unity, three D we're so limited in how much access we have to a lot of this stuff.

335
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,442
Speaker 0: And so we're sort of at their mercy.

336
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,685
Speaker 0: I think it's the way I want to have.

337
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:40,910
Speaker 2: other unity games would crash as much, you know, well, then there would have to be one.

338
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, but hey, the new Nintendo Wii U, you can ride unity games for it.

339
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,139
Speaker 0: Oh, great.

340
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,760
Speaker 0: Sure.

341
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,643
Speaker 2: Nintendo will let you sell those on the store.

342
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:56,090
Speaker 1: The Wii U came out this weekend and I did not know that someone posted on the forum tomorrow.

343
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone on the forum is recording.

344
00:15:58,053 --> 00:15:59,555
Speaker 2: So you've already got it out.

345
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:01,658
Speaker 1: I won't have it.

346
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,041
Speaker 2: I mean, anyone listening, it's already out.

347
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:04,942
Speaker 1: It's like Nintendo.

348
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:10,670
Speaker 1: Way to, way to be the one thing in my entire life that was constant and trusted without reservation.

349
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,212
Speaker 1: And to blow that.

350
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:20,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, they blew it hard to like generations of bad decisions for me to actually move from sight unseen to going to wait and see.

351
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:23,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, this one, this one was particularly bad.

352
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:38,650
Speaker 0: I mean, when you're, when you're up at E3 showing footage of call of duty that you recorded on a PC talking about your next generation graphics, man, you really kind of have to consider where you are at and then ship what is basically an Xbox three 60 repackaged into Nintendo hardware.

353
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,035
Speaker 0: Man, they've got to be, they've got to be desperate is the only thing I could think.

354
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,517
Speaker 1: And yet they've got the controller.

355
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:48,322
Speaker 1: So they're doing what they, they're doing what they should have done seven years ago.

356
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:49,303
Speaker 0: Now.

357
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:51,526
Speaker 2: Oh, well.

358
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:54,290
Speaker 1: So do you play any video games?

359
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:55,291
Speaker 2: Yeah.

360
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,093
Speaker 2: Well, what games are you playing right now?

361
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:57,794
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

362
00:16:57,874 --> 00:17:01,179
Speaker 0: So I'm playing Mass Effect three multiplayer with everybody.

363
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,100
Speaker 2: How does that work?

364
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,023
Speaker 0: It is board mode in call of duty.

365
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:06,846
Speaker 0: So you survive waves of enemies.

366
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:09,490
Speaker 0: You complete mission objectives on every third wave.

367
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:15,257
Speaker 0: And I play it with, uh, Ananth and my, uh, my girlfriend, Rochelle, and we have a good time.

368
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:22,848
Speaker 0: Um, and I also was playing fallout, new Vegas for quite some time, which it was the best of times.

369
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:24,050
Speaker 0: And it was the worst of times.

370
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,032
Speaker 2: I played it a little bit and then I stopped.

371
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:27,233
Speaker 0: Yeah.

372
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:38,050
Speaker 0: I was impressed obviously with the world as ever, but towards the end of it, I felt like I was tiptoeing around the crash bugs or tiptoeing around the bugs that would delete my inventory.

373
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,413
Speaker 2: I am glad I didn't get that far.

374
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:41,635
Speaker 2: I had problems early on.

375
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:45,802
Speaker 2: where it's like, I think in the first town, there's like a robot, but I never talked to the robot.

376
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:50,370
Speaker 2: And then when I went to the second town, the robot was there and he acted like he knew me already.

377
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,277
Speaker 2: And I was like, I was like, I know you were in the first town because people talked about you, but I never found you.

378
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:59,724
Speaker 2: And why are you here now acting like, you know, me, shouldn't we introduce first?

379
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,166
Speaker 2: And it is stuff like that.

380
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,810
Speaker 2: Whereas in the original fallout three didn't have issues like that.

381
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:11,110
Speaker 2: You know, everything sort of more was, I think they spent more time on making sure each person and character behaved appropriately and was in the right place.

382
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:11,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

383
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,114
Speaker 1: Well, like when I remember the guy who wants to blow up Megaton.

384
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:14,935
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

385
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:17,719
Speaker 1: When I met him the first time I was like, you fucker.

386
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:19,502
Speaker 1: And I just punched him to death right there.

387
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:21,865
Speaker 1: And that plot just disappeared.

388
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:22,506
Speaker 1: Never came up again.

389
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,009
Speaker 1: And I took his clothes and the whole rest of the game.

390
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:26,311
Speaker 0: Yeah.

391
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:32,796
Speaker 0: I also, I feel like all out three proper spoken, a more coherent voice throughout the game.

392
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:37,339
Speaker 0: I really do feel like new Vegas, although at times it was significantly stronger overall.

393
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:38,360
Speaker 0: I don't think it was as cohesive.

394
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,201
Speaker 0: It was still really good.

395
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:40,041
Speaker 0: Like, don't even get me wrong.

396
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,182
Speaker 0: I, I want that setting.

397
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:51,010
Speaker 1: I love those games, but it was because the primary joy I got from it was exploring the world and kind of seeing cool things like the ruin houses and everything.

398
00:18:51,470 --> 00:19:00,396
Speaker 1: But the fact that it was actually so sparse and so generic other than very tiny areas of content that I kind of lost interest almost immediately.

399
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:00,496
Speaker 2: Yeah.

400
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:01,117
Speaker 2: That's another thing.

401
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:04,799
Speaker 2: Cause fallout three is like you come out of the vault and then what?

402
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,161
Speaker 1: And I'm like, Oh my God, look at that freeway.

403
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:11,504
Speaker 2: Not only is it technologically open world, it's the plot is open.

404
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:16,387
Speaker 2: It's like Megaton is right there obviously, but it's like, you don't have to fucking go there first.

405
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:18,708
Speaker 2: It's like, you don't, you know, just, you can see it there.

406
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:21,050
Speaker 2: So it's sort of a design choice, but you can just go out there and you can see it there.

407
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,213
Speaker 2: Whereas in fallout new Vegas, it's definitely more of a linear, like, go here next, dude.

408
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:27,354
Speaker 2: They're telling you where to go.

409
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,176
Speaker 2: You know, like, Hey, you should really go that way.

410
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:30,416
Speaker 2: Yeah.

411
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:34,258
Speaker 1: More sort of a deus exe of, yeah, the plot's over there whenever you're ready, dude.

412
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:34,819
Speaker 0: Yeah.

413
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:39,262
Speaker 0: I really do feel like that was a very intentional choice made on feedback from the first game.

414
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:44,305
Speaker 0: Like in fallout three, I'd be willing to bet that they got a lot of feedback that was like, well, I just didn't know where to go.

415
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:51,050
Speaker 0: And so they probably, they probably doubled down on being easy and in doing so probably punch that particular aspect of it.

416
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,931
Speaker 0: To the game in the face.

417
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:54,192
Speaker 1: Did you play the new deus exe human revolution?

418
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:55,253
Speaker 1: I guess it's not new anymore.

419
00:19:55,313 --> 00:19:55,533
Speaker 0: I did.

420
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:56,734
Speaker 0: I played human revolution.

421
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:57,274
Speaker 0: Did you like it?

422
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:57,955
Speaker 0: I did.

423
00:19:57,975 --> 00:19:59,976
Speaker 0: Uh, I thought it was, I thought it was very good.

424
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:06,120
Speaker 0: Um, of course there, this is, this is another one of those cases where you're talking about design concessions from the first one.

425
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:12,644
Speaker 0: Uh, I think that the first one was more interesting in some ways.

426
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:17,748
Speaker 0: Uh, and also the newest deus exe brought to light for me exactly how bad every modern stealth game is.

427
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:19,709
Speaker 0: I think every stealth game is bad.

428
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:21,330
Speaker 0: Yeah.

429
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:25,495
Speaker 0: Uh, cause I like, I tried playing it except for thief.

430
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:26,997
Speaker 2: thief and nothing else.

431
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:28,879
Speaker 1: Mark of the ninjas 2d thief gold.

432
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:29,600
Speaker 1: That was a good job.

433
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,781
Speaker 2: He've gold is also gay.

434
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:31,882
Speaker 0: Yeah.

435
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:38,770
Speaker 1: Three came for free with my creative graphics blaster extreme, I think, or some other video card I bought and using the old school glide drivers.

436
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, dude.

437
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:43,944
Speaker 1: I remember when my friend Ken came over when he's like, I have open GL.

438
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,150
Speaker 1: We're going to play GL quake.

439
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,211
Speaker 0: Do love glide.

440
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:51,894
Speaker 0: That's like, it's like technological API or sex tool.

441
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:55,097
Speaker 0: We can make a fun game out of this.

442
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:55,518
Speaker 0: Actually.

443
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:58,080
Speaker 2: We should make a new, a new standard to compete with them.

444
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:05,868
Speaker 2: K y you feel like everyone does your video cards for k y it better.

445
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:07,629
Speaker 2: It's really hard to install it in the case.

446
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:08,430
Speaker 2: It just keeps slipping.

447
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,952
Speaker 0: It was supposed to make inserting these cards easier.

448
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:22,739
Speaker 0: No, just inserting the cables is easier, but uh, but yeah, so day deus X, but I really liked, again, I really liked the environment.

449
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:23,559
Speaker 0: I liked the world.

450
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:24,720
Speaker 0: I thought that they did a lot of things.

451
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:38,650
Speaker 1: worried about it in deus X was much deeper feeling and more fleshed out and all the interesting side bits were interesting as opposed to follow three, which actually, well, I know it's a barren post-apocalyptic wasteland, but I was kind of taken aback.

452
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:47,976
Speaker 0: At how barren it was, even like inside of town, new Vegas in particular, it's supposed to feel very sparse, obviously, I think due to its, uh, desert location.

453
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:48,597
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

454
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:49,457
Speaker 0: It's, it's in a desert.

455
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:53,340
Speaker 0: And so you're supposed to feel this, this, the gravity of this massive world.

456
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,222
Speaker 2: And if there wasn't apocalypse pretty much anywhere is going to be sparse.

457
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:56,622
Speaker 2: Yeah.

458
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:56,862
Speaker 0: Yeah.

459
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:02,966
Speaker 0: But, and, and even in DC and in fallout three, there were buildings and there were things, but it was extremely empty.

460
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:04,047
Speaker 0: And of course that was part of the feel.

461
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:08,830
Speaker 0: And so you remove the buildings from the emptiness and it's literal, just like sort of how, you know, a universe and gravity.

462
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,334
Speaker 2: It takes over after all the other forces of neutral that entropy always wins.

463
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:21,619
Speaker 0: But, but yeah, so, uh, otherwise I can't think of what I've really been.

464
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:23,200
Speaker 0: Well, I've been playing a lot of my own game.

465
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,821
Speaker 0: guns of Icarus as you can probably

466
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:26,462
Speaker 2: talk about that for a

467
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:29,664
Speaker 1: bit is to give you the most honest feedback.

468
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:31,325
Speaker 1: I can give actually fun.

469
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:38,210
Speaker 1: The fact that I play it at all in my, in my rotation, my 10 year rotation of counter-strike sleep and natural selection.

470
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,393
Speaker 1: The fact that I'm playing guns of Icarus as a lot.

471
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:40,834
Speaker 0: Yeah.

472
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:44,339
Speaker 0: And, and I am a very harsh self critic.

473
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:50,107
Speaker 0: I will, I will critique, critique myself very strongly, but I'm actually willing to say that I'm very proud of the work that we've done on guns of Icarus.

474
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:52,210
Speaker 0: And I think it's fun and I like playing it.

475
00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:05,730
Speaker 0: So it's a, just for, for those of you who might be listening and somehow, uh, haven't heard me talk about this on another channel, it is a steampunk airship combat game, and it's all small team-based.

476
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,515
Speaker 0: So you and three other dudes get onto this airship and shoot down other dudes full of four people.

477
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:24,150
Speaker 0: And, uh, you obviously you're all on teams and, uh, you have to work together on the ship to perform various tasks like manning the guns, which are affixed to hard points or repairing, uh, the hard points and the weapons and your engines and hull.

478
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:35,310
Speaker 0: And then there's of course the captain who is ostensibly in charge and hollering at you to do things that if my play experience is any indicator, you will ignore and just camp, camp the balloon while our hull gets blown up.

479
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:38,533
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, it's, it's actually fun.

480
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:39,254
Speaker 0: I do.

481
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:43,260
Speaker 0: I can recommend it in good conscience and say, this is a fun game that I worked on the most fun.

482
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,789
Speaker 1: Like once I was playing during the beta with Adam and he's like in storm going to do and he's, he's Clanny and old school.

483
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:49,490
Speaker 1: Like I kind of am.

484
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,136
Speaker 1: So once the two of us were on a ship together, that shit was motherfucking invincible.

485
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:54,838
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

486
00:23:54,858 --> 00:24:02,510
Speaker 2: You guys probably, cause he'd just be like rubber guns, broadside coming three, two, cause every other, cause everyone and every other ship was camping the balloon or whatever.

487
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,070
Speaker 0: Yeah.

488
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,472
Speaker 0: Then we're all just hammering away.

489
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:07,917
Speaker 2: If you have two people working together, well forget it.

490
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:09,178
Speaker 0: Yeah.

491
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:16,568
Speaker 0: We see, we see ships now in game with, with like really experienced players and they, they are really into it.

492
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,890
Speaker 0: They're talking about meta strategy.

493
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,573
Speaker 0: They, we, we added this item.

494
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:26,143
Speaker 0: It was like a harpoon gun and you can harpoon ships and like drag them into you and like nobody used it.

495
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:27,785
Speaker 0: Everybody was like, what is this even for?

496
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:28,226
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

497
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,196
Speaker 2: What I will harpoon and then they can't get, you can see really easy to shoot them now.

498
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:36,478
Speaker 0: This was, this was our thought.

499
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,343
Speaker 0: Initially we were like, well you just harpoon them and you drag them in for the flame thrower.

500
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:44,210
Speaker 0: We almost like you, you could very easily see how you would use it on the ships with two guns on the same side.

501
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,351
Speaker 0: We're like, this will be great.

502
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:58,450
Speaker 0: What we didn't expect was there's a ship with two guns on the very front and the new strategy is to put two harpoons up there and harpoon somebody at you and drag them into you at such speed that you careen right through them and destroy them with your ship.

503
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,035
Speaker 1: That is really, you like, it's amazing.

504
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:06,322
Speaker 2: So you had, you, you put in ramming damage, which is a factor of speed and the size of your ship.

505
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:11,970
Speaker 2: And it just so happened that the speed of the harpoon pole added with the, it just, it just worked out that way.

506
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,412
Speaker 2: You didn't put it in there on purpose.

507
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:16,299
Speaker 0: The ship is the pyramidion, which is a very fast ship to begin with.

508
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:20,790
Speaker 0: And so you, you increase the speed at which you're traveling by like pulling the other ship into you.

509
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:25,359
Speaker 0: You effectively double your collision damage and in doing so you just barrel right through them.

510
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,750
Speaker 0: So you start on broadsides to weaken like their components and then you just careen into them with these harpoons.

511
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:36,390
Speaker 2: I mean, you don't, I don't think even want to check to make sure whether those physics are accurate, right?

512
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:43,584
Speaker 0: I will say actually our, our guy, Jezary Bankston, who did all of the flight and collision models, they're incredibly well modeled.

513
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:46,410
Speaker 0: The, the flight model is, is extremely physics based.

514
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:52,322
Speaker 0: So the distance that your engines are away from the center of the ship, for example, determines your rotation speed.

515
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:55,488
Speaker 0: It determines how fast you can turn because he's applying torque in that way.

516
00:25:55,528 --> 00:25:56,290
Speaker 0: It's, it's really cool.

517
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,002
Speaker 0: He actually wrote a biplane flight model too.

518
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:00,310
Speaker 2: That's super accurate.

519
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,347
Speaker 1: So who's writing the boarding engine?

520
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:06,509
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm glad you should ask about that because it's time for me to kill you.

521
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,729
Speaker 2: We've made this joke before.

522
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:20,210
Speaker 1: I think it's, it's that you, I think part of your success in my opinion is that you guys, because I seem to know a lot of people at this company somehow are doing the opposite of what the tribes two team did.

523
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:29,050
Speaker 1: You have a forum, you look at what your people, like the people playing your game say, but then you make your own decisions based on that feedback instead of doing what they ask.

524
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,914
Speaker 0: This is, this is the only way to make a game.

525
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:39,530
Speaker 0: And, and I said this in another place and I was actually pretty happy with this analogy is that if you have a room full of smoke, your players will ask you to put in a fan to blow away the smoke.

526
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,552
Speaker 0: What you actually want to do is put out the fire.

527
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:54,170
Speaker 0: And so when, when people ask us for things, we like to put them through a filter of like, well, what problem are they attempting to solve with this and how can we affect that more positively or at a more fundamental level?

528
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,595
Speaker 0: And I'm, I'm really happy with the work that we've done in that regard.

529
00:26:57,675 --> 00:27:00,200
Speaker 0: We, a lot of people are very right about a lot of things.

530
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,230
Speaker 0: So for example, the ability to form a crew before you enter into matchmaking or before you enter into a match, that is important.

531
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:13,750
Speaker 2: You can't, you can't, you get in the game, it starts, no one's joined the server yet because they're still loading the map and the game starts and no one wants to get in the comm chair.

532
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,769
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike even has that problem in puppy games.

533
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,491
Speaker 1: Yeah.

534
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:19,293
Speaker 0: So we're, we're actively looking at that.

535
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:22,677
Speaker 0: We, we just implemented and by the time this airs, it will be out.

536
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:28,585
Speaker 0: But, um, Monday coming up, we have a big patch that will do automatic rematch.

537
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:32,790
Speaker 0: So when you're done with a game, it'll put you into a new game on a new map with the same people.

538
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:33,992
Speaker 0: And that's not done yet.

539
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:36,396
Speaker 0: Uh, and so, you know, it'll be in on Monday.

540
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,317
Speaker 0: I'm really excited about it.

541
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:45,470
Speaker 0: And, uh, of course we're going to be making fixes to spectator mode and the like to better support, uh, tournament casting and we're going to get clan support in, in the near future as well.

542
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:46,632
Speaker 0: All right.

543
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:46,933
Speaker 0: Yeah.

544
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:52,847
Speaker 0: We're, we're really excited about, you know, we're going to try to make this game more competitive, I think, and then cater to that community.

545
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:54,110
Speaker 0: It should be really cool.

546
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,791
Speaker 1: That's a good community.

547
00:27:54,831 --> 00:27:56,093
Speaker 1: That community is on the upswing.

548
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,097
Speaker 1: lately has been rocking it.

549
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:00,561
Speaker 1: I mean, you saw the legal legends thing at pass.

550
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:05,670
Speaker 1: That was, that was like more professional than that fake tournament in the wizard.

551
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,110
Speaker 2: Yeah.

552
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,316
Speaker 2: I think it's definitely, it's, it's becoming a crowded space.

553
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:13,250
Speaker 2: There's a lot of people going for it, but I think everyone's going for it because you know, the pie is getting bigger, right?

554
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:21,210
Speaker 2: So, you know, you might feel like, well, how are we, anyone going to care about my game being competitive when everyone's playing, you know, all these mobas and FPSs and such?

555
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:28,586
Speaker 2: Well, there's, you know, there's a whole lot of people looking for games to watch, you know, there's no hockey, no hockey.

556
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:29,649
Speaker 0: watch guns instead.

557
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:30,210
Speaker 0: That's right.

558
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,675
Speaker 0: No, I mean, and it's twitch TV is huge.

559
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:33,638
Speaker 0: No, absolutely.

560
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:38,570
Speaker 0: And we're, you know, we, we have an official channel on twitch and we're, we're trying to court some casters on twitch.

561
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:41,635
Speaker 0: I'm really excited about getting more into this space.

562
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:46,686
Speaker 0: and on the topic of mobas, how do you guys feel about stupid?

563
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:48,310
Speaker 2: I'll be honest.

564
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:48,710
Speaker 2: Okay.

565
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,095
Speaker 2: I think the fundamental game of a MOBA, right?

566
00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:57,062
Speaker 2: The, you know, five on five sort of, you know, thing, it has something going on there.

567
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:57,562
Speaker 2: It's fun.

568
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:03,150
Speaker 2: I kind of want to play kind of like a versus tower defense, but the reality of what every implementation is.

569
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,112
Speaker 2: Some are better than others.

570
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:09,722
Speaker 2: Like legal legends is better than Dota because it doesn't have the nonsense, denying bullshit is the bottom, right?

571
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:14,070
Speaker 2: But they're all, you know, it's like they get the details wrong.

572
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:25,490
Speaker 2: And I feel like if I made a MOBA, I could keep the same fundamental thing, you know, game idea of, you know, five on five control one guy on this map, but it would, but it would be good because there wouldn't be any bullshit.

573
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,893
Speaker 1: Well, this gets into the same thing.

574
00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:35,070
Speaker 1: I mean, in my opinion, MOBAs steer wrong and that the original game had a lot of emergent properties that people who can, you know, had a really strong community around it.

575
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:39,415
Speaker 1: So people would do these emergent things like the last hitting, because that was just the limitation of this mod.

576
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:51,790
Speaker 1: But then when they like canonized those emergent behaviors into legit game mechanics, instead of addressing them in a different way, that is where these games fall flat.

577
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:56,490
Speaker 2: So, you know, judging by the way you even asked that question, I get the feeling you are also anti MOBA.

578
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:02,569
Speaker 0: Let me let me preface this by saying that it is my hope to someday compose a rap song so that I can use the line last hits like MOBAs.

579
00:30:03,632 --> 00:30:05,423
Speaker 2: There is the Dotas, you know, the...

580
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,220
Speaker 0: MOBAs represent a really interesting case study for me because it's exactly what you said.

581
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,410
Speaker 0: It's the emergent properties and how they've translated into codified formalized rule sets.

582
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:20,857
Speaker 0: And I think you're dead on with the last hits.

583
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:25,470
Speaker 0: I think the concept of last hit and you, man, you see this in other games, too.

584
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,150
Speaker 0: So I mentioned I was playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

585
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:34,390
Speaker 0: The points you get from killing enemies is weighted extremely heavily in your favor if you get the last hit.

586
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:37,601
Speaker 0: Even if you didn't contribute most of the damage, you get that last hit.

587
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,990
Speaker 0: You get an insane amount of like experience points.

588
00:30:41,476 --> 00:30:44,850
Speaker 0: I consider that a weak design, I think.

589
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,798
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's a symptom of a greater problem.

590
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,370
Speaker 1: Those mechanics are there, in my opinion.

591
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:55,630
Speaker 1: I can use a better lexicon now because I've read that Characteristics of Games book that we learned about at PAX Dev.

592
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:04,490
Speaker 1: But these games, they have these skill components that require you to master all of these sort of individual fiddly bits.

593
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:13,290
Speaker 1: Because that's the only way to give these games enough strategic and tactical and execution depth to make them appeal to competitive players.

594
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:18,990
Speaker 1: Because there's an extremely high return on investment for learning those skills.

595
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:25,330
Speaker 1: But the problem for me is that those skills that these games make you learn are not analogous to what the game is about at all.

596
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:29,750
Speaker 1: The game appears to be about one thing, but really it's about the worst parts of StarCraft.

597
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:31,614
Speaker 2: Last hitting, right?

598
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,462
Speaker 2: It's like, well, why is last hitting a thing?

599
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:35,350
Speaker 2: Last hitting a thing has always been in video games.

600
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,514
Speaker 2: If you kill the guy, you get the frag.

601
00:31:37,554 --> 00:31:45,150
Speaker 2: In Quake, if you're the one who kills the guy with your Rocky, even if the other guy did 99 of the damage, you are the one who gets the frag on your score.

602
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,250
Speaker 1: Dude, Crystal Warriors on the game gear.

603
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:48,718
Speaker 2: And the reason for this, right?

604
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:51,007
Speaker 2: Why is the reason that every game does this?

605
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:51,690
Speaker 2: This is the reason.

606
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:55,702
Speaker 2: Because we need to add the code that says frag plus one has to be somewhere.

607
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:56,484
Speaker 2: Where do we put it?

608
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:58,550
Speaker 2: We put it in the onDeath function.

609
00:31:59,173 --> 00:31:59,454
Speaker 2: Right?

610
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:03,410
Speaker 2: So, when someone dies, that's when someone gets a frag.

611
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,016
Speaker 2: So, in the onDeath function, right?

612
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:10,789
Speaker 2: How do we, oh, we have to also have access to the person to give this frag to.

613
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:19,410
Speaker 2: Well, we don't, you know, we're going to do at that moment when someone dies, have a running tally of all the damage that's been done to them and figure out, you know.

614
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:22,330
Speaker 2: No one was going to do that, especially not way back in like a mud.

615
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,172
Speaker 2: Well, certainly.

616
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:32,750
Speaker 2: This is carried over till the present day and towards become sort of just gaming common sense in a way, even though it's not common sense, but to where no one would think to do it differently.

617
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:41,850
Speaker 0: Mass Effect 3 does accumulate damage counters though for everybody and experience is divvied up, but the waiting function is my objection in this case, I think.

618
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:51,490
Speaker 0: And I'll also preface this by saying that I'm more in line with Dave Serlin, for example, who's doing a lot of work for Capcom right now on balancing the old school fighting.

619
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:56,509
Speaker 0: He used to be an active member in the fighting game community, but he and I suffer from the same problem in that we're both hands.

620
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:57,592
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

621
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:03,490
Speaker 0: Actually, neither of us are particularly good at execution and we don't necessarily consider that to be the core component of the game.

622
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,411
Speaker 1: So you can play Yomi.

623
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:17,010
Speaker 1: Well, if you remove those components, then you get to the situation where all games break down pretty rapidly and return on investment of skill has to eventually have an end game that is within the reach of players.

624
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:25,090
Speaker 1: MOBAs have these shitty fiddly mechanics because that's the only way to keep a perfect end game out of the grasp of a player who's dedicated to solving the game.

625
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,619
Speaker 0: I think to a degree, I would actually rather make a good game every two years.

626
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,985
Speaker 0: If that's the alternative, I would rather make a good game every two years.

627
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,402
Speaker 1: Ah, that is why I put so much stock in German board games because we solve every game we play eventually.

628
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:38,966
Speaker 1: I mean, Settlers isn't done.

629
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:40,290
Speaker 1: I'm done with Settlers, but you know what?

630
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,829
Speaker 2: Every time.

631
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,470
Speaker 1: It was way fun while I was playing it and when I was done with it, I played a different game.

632
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:52,126
Speaker 2: And you look at board games and constantly there are new ones coming out that are all awesome and in some way, you know, it's like Settlers is no good anymore.

633
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:54,050
Speaker 2: Where did this eclipse thing come from?

634
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,950
Speaker 2: Suddenly this huge hit game selling all selling out multiple editions.

635
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:03,450
Speaker 1: Though I do still play Counter-Strike and I like it for all the meta reasons that these kids like MOBAs.

636
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:09,370
Speaker 1: So I can't pretend that I'm immune to the desire to see a great return on investment.

637
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:14,889
Speaker 2: But at least that the you know, that stuff in Counter-Strike, you know, makes sense, right?

638
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,230
Speaker 1: The actions are analogous.

639
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:16,670
Speaker 2: Right.

640
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,315
Speaker 2: The actions are analogous to what you're trying to do.

641
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:22,025
Speaker 2: I mean, in Street Fighter, they make mostly sense, but not as much sense as Counter-Strike.

642
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:23,409
Speaker 2: And in Dota, they make even less sense.

643
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:24,748
Speaker 2: Shoot your own guys to win.

644
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,248
Speaker 1: I think Soul Calibur has a better analogy.

645
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,130
Speaker 2: Soul Calibur has the best analogy of any real time fighting game that I have played ever.

646
00:34:33,353 --> 00:34:34,290
Speaker 1: Well, Bushido Blade.

647
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:34,996
Speaker 2: No.

648
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:36,638
Speaker 0: Wow.

649
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,268
Speaker 0: Taking it back.

650
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,350
Speaker 0: I haven't even heard the words Bushido Blade.

651
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:43,730
Speaker 1: I was not good at Bushido Blade, but I was better than all my friends.

652
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,735
Speaker 0: It was an SNK game.

653
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:46,005
Speaker 0: I'm thinking of the right game.

654
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:46,670
Speaker 0: That was an SNK game.

655
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,250
Speaker 2: It was the realistic 3D PlayStation game where when you hit someone, they were dead.

656
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:50,853
Speaker 0: Long game.

657
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:51,560
Speaker 0: OK, cool.

658
00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:52,510
Speaker 2: Never mind.

659
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,230
Speaker 2: No, you're thinking of the game where I showed up.

660
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,210
Speaker 1: I was like, I've got a sword and you've got a hammer.

661
00:34:56,571 --> 00:35:00,750
Speaker 1: If I hit you with the sword, maybe you're dead or you're almost dead.

662
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,986
Speaker 2: Or you're wounded at best.

663
00:35:02,512 --> 00:35:03,806
Speaker 1: And you start looping around the ring.

664
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:04,755
Speaker 1: Like, ready?

665
00:35:04,795 --> 00:35:05,181
Speaker 1: Go.

666
00:35:05,222 --> 00:35:05,689
Speaker 1: Someone's dead.

667
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,301
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

668
00:35:07,687 --> 00:35:07,910
Speaker 2: Anyway.

669
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:09,700
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

670
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,429
Speaker 1: I love those games.

671
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:11,691
Speaker 0: Yeah.

672
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:14,790
Speaker 0: Now I'm just looking forward to my Strike Suit Zero Kickstarter coming through.

673
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:21,450
Speaker 0: I really like just sometimes, man, like especially working in games now and having to actually make game design decisions.

674
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,130
Speaker 0: Some days I just like to come home and shoot other spaceships in a spaceship.

675
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:25,689
Speaker 0: That's just the thing I like to do.

676
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,030
Speaker 0: And Strike Suit Zero looks like it's going to be a blast.

677
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:35,770
Speaker 0: And even, you know, even if it's just like to a degree, what I what I've always wanted was sort of like a free space kind of game with like Newtonian physics where you could.

678
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,830
Speaker 2: Nobody's made a free space game in so long.

679
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,576
Speaker 1: No, I would I would I would if there was.

680
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:43,550
Speaker 1: if somehow if Disney made a new TIE Fighter game happen, that was a free space shooter.

681
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,477
Speaker 2: Oh, Disney.

682
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,550
Speaker 1: I would tie fighter.

683
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,730
Speaker 1: I would probably back the highest level of whatever.

684
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,763
Speaker 2: I don't think Disney needs to kickstart anything.

685
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:52,690
Speaker 2: They got money.

686
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,316
Speaker 0: Well, I guess a principle.

687
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:56,489
Speaker 0: I absolutely appreciate it.

688
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,550
Speaker 0: But like, you know, I really remember that Sophie game that came out for the Xbox 360 that was made by Square Enix.

689
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:03,790
Speaker 2: I didn't play it, but I know it was silly.

690
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,700
Speaker 0: It was silly as shit.

691
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,610
Speaker 0: It was like anime spaceships.

692
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,257
Speaker 0: And yeah, it was.

693
00:36:08,337 --> 00:36:10,130
Speaker 0: it was just really dumb and flashy.

694
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:11,481
Speaker 0: And like, I loved it.

695
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:12,309
Speaker 0: I love the shit out of it.

696
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,724
Speaker 0: I must have played it for like 60 hours.

697
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:20,568
Speaker 2: It was just like to this day, there's someone listening right now who's like, yeah, they're like, oh, my God, someone else played seriously.

698
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,530
Speaker 2: And he's like, yeah, the voice acting was awful.

699
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,845
Speaker 2: And now he's listening to this and saying, oh, my God, it's me.

700
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:27,529
Speaker 2: They're talking about me.

701
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:39,990
Speaker 0: Interestingly, when we used to do game jams at work where like every Friday at the last Friday of the month, we would all sit down and a programmer would pair off with an artist and you would come up with your idea for a game.

702
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:42,549
Speaker 0: And then we would vet these ideas and see if anything good came out.

703
00:36:43,152 --> 00:36:45,789
Speaker 0: And I am not a creative person by any means.

704
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:47,649
Speaker 0: I'm just I'm just not.

705
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:53,490
Speaker 0: And so I got paired with John Lynn and John was like, you know, what games do you like?

706
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:58,467
Speaker 0: And I was like, well, you remember Sophie from the PC and like nineteen eighty three.

707
00:36:58,487 --> 00:36:59,290
Speaker 0: I like that.

708
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,752
Speaker 0: I also kind of like to rez.

709
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:09,310
Speaker 0: And so I made this like a rez, like Sophie game that used the music on your hard drive to to create like waveforms and enemy enemy patterns and stuff.

710
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:17,570
Speaker 2: So that was that was the extent of pretty sure that I'm pretty sure the original Sophie wasn't that like for more systems and like any game ever.

711
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:22,210
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, it was like there was a Web page I went to once I had like samples from like every sound card ever.

712
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:28,510
Speaker 2: And like the only game that they could find that they could actually test and all these different sound cards through the generations was like the original.

713
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,519
Speaker 2: So I'm pretty sure it was the original Sophie.

714
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,826
Speaker 2: I have to check that out.

715
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:32,530
Speaker 0: It would make sense.

716
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,409
Speaker 2: It was like Commodore, you know, Atari.

717
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,569
Speaker 0: I was like, what might have made it all the way up to the Sound Blaster era.

718
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:45,644
Speaker 1: I remember when I got my dad, he wouldn't buy me more RAM, but he bought me a Sound Blaster AWE 32 advanced wave effects.

719
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,770
Speaker 1: The only benefit was MIDI was a little bit better set in your blaster environment variables.

720
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,650
Speaker 1: You realize that thing needed two IRQs.

721
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was serious business back then, man.

722
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:00,110
Speaker 0: Not to be trifled with.

723
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, high level ones that you had to reboot DOS in a real mode.

724
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,353
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

725
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:08,410
Speaker 1: I made boot disk because SimCity 2000 would not play on my computer.

726
00:38:08,531 --> 00:38:10,949
Speaker 2: I only needed boot disk for the mech warrior, too.

727
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,870
Speaker 2: And I only freaking had to do that until I got 16 megs of RAM.

728
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,662
Speaker 1: Until I upgraded my RAM, I could not play Doom.

729
00:38:18,682 --> 00:38:20,390
Speaker 1: if I booted the computer legit.

730
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,368
Speaker 2: I had 8 megs of RAM, so I could always play Doom.

731
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:27,030
Speaker 1: I'd hold an F5 to boot to like raw DOS and then I would type mouse to load my mouse driver.

732
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,181
Speaker 1: Hi Mem Mem Maker, all that stuff.

733
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:30,630
Speaker 1: And then I would start Doom.

734
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:36,930
Speaker 2: Not only that, but I, because I had 8 megs of RAM and a quad speed CD-ROM, I could install Doom and Doom 2 in under a minute.

735
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:42,409
Speaker 2: So I could just keep, whenever I needed more space, whenever I needed more space, I could delete it.

736
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,029
Speaker 1: Doom came on a fucking disk.

737
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,170
Speaker 2: I had a CD-ROM that had Doom 2 and Doom Ultimate.

738
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,026
Speaker 0: Maybe at the time he had to put into a plastic caddy to load into his CD drive.

739
00:38:52,086 --> 00:38:52,830
Speaker 2: You don't know, it's possible.

740
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,870
Speaker 2: No, the CD drive was quad speed, bitches.

741
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:56,450
Speaker 0: So by that time, yeah, you're right.

742
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,590
Speaker 2: That's why I said Doom installed, like boom, it's installed.

743
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,769
Speaker 1: Scott, I bought the Doom 2 shareware like when Doom 2 came out.

744
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:06,029
Speaker 1: And then I'd use like wadded and de-hacked to make my own Mavs.

745
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:07,307
Speaker 2: Good job.

746
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:09,187
Speaker 1: I'm very proud of myself.

747
00:39:09,772 --> 00:39:10,228
Speaker 0: Those were the days.

748
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,005
Speaker 2: They were.

749
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,289
Speaker 2: So what are you into besides technology and games that you were known for?

750
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,750
Speaker 2: Uh, well, I live with a lot of- I know you were a nerd of many colors.

751
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I live with several illustrators and many of whom do comics.

752
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:28,990
Speaker 0: And so I end up reading a lot of comics or as to say, comics end up piling up next to my desk.

753
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:29,669
Speaker 2: That sounds like me.

754
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:30,958
Speaker 0: I should read them.

755
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:32,229
Speaker 0: I think that's the way I want to put it.

756
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,769
Speaker 2: What's piled up next to your desk right now?

757
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:34,549
Speaker 0: Oh, God.

758
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:40,960
Speaker 0: The worst part is Ananth will periodically come into my room and just be like, "Hey, we got these in the mail.

759
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:42,026
Speaker 0: You should read one of

760
00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:42,288
Speaker 0: these.".

761
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,950
Speaker 2: And so I will say- You didn't know if Ananth is going to do this, it's going to be good.

762
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

763
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you put it on the pile of everything else, that's good.

764
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,290
Speaker 1: Particularly- I mean, I just got my Daisy Cutter Kickstarter.

765
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,570
Speaker 1: I haven't even like read it at all.

766
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,509
Speaker 0: That looks so good.

767
00:39:52,652 --> 00:39:53,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does look good.

768
00:39:53,611 --> 00:39:56,690
Speaker 0: I will say that I just finished up King City by Brandon Graham.

769
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,050
Speaker 0: King City was originally a Tokyo pop property.

770
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,029
Speaker 0: They published the first book.

771
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:03,010
Speaker 0: It didn't take off.

772
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,947
Speaker 0: And then so they canned it.

773
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:04,909
Speaker 2: Oh, right, right.

774
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:07,169
Speaker 2: A lot of those people have found other places to go.

775
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sat in purgatory for like several years.

776
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,450
Speaker 0: But recently the Omnibus got published.

777
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:16,970
Speaker 0: So it's this amazing, large, hardcover compilation of all the King City comics.

778
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:21,330
Speaker 0: And it is just the most incredible, off-the-wall, urban decay.

779
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,390
Speaker 0: I highly recommend it.

780
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,710
Speaker 0: I'm not going to do it justice summarizing it because this is sadly not my forte.

781
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:35,630
Speaker 0: But I do recommend everybody grab at least the first King City volume, if not the whole hardcover, and just give it a read because it's a blast.

782
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,039
Speaker 0: I love it.

783
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,830
Speaker 2: How about in terms of, you know, movies, musics, and that sort of thing?

784
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,410
Speaker 1: Did you see Wreck-It Ralph?

785
00:40:41,893 --> 00:40:42,970
Speaker 0: I did see Wreck-It Ralph.

786
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,530
Speaker 1: Did you like it?

787
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:48,990
Speaker 1: Because I liked it because Roger Rabbit did in that all the plot was like new characters and the old characters were just cameos.

788
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,190
Speaker 1: They weren't actually- Absolutely.

789
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,690
Speaker 1: Like Bowser was not the villain.

790
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:57,590
Speaker 0: No, it nails what a video game movie sort of needs to be, right?

791
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,070
Speaker 0: Especially because you're absolutely right in your analogy of Roger Rabbit.

792
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,310
Speaker 1: So did you notice that Sandy Fox did one of the fucking voices and AKB48 did the theme to Sugar Rush?

793
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,243
Speaker 1: Well, I did notice AKB48.

794
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,310
Speaker 0: I didn't notice Sandy Fox or something?

795
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:07,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sandy Fox.

796
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:08,990
Speaker 1: I don't even know what voice he did.

797
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:09,570
Speaker 1: She was credited.

798
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,281
Speaker 1: I was like, "Sandy

799
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:10,688
Speaker 1: Fox?".

800
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:11,950
Speaker 1: I still haven't looked up what she did.

801
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait a minute.

802
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:13,549
Speaker 0: I didn't realize that.

803
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,190
Speaker 2: It's Rim's favorite.

804
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:19,170
Speaker 2: The only thing that can make Rim go crazier is if it was like a two-mix opener.

805
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:25,347
Speaker 1: I was just watching old anime openers from the '90s.

806
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,410
Speaker 0: Getting some Nagumi Hayashibara into your diet.

807
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,228
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

808
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:30,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, two-mix, man.

809
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,250
Speaker 0: Did they do rhythm and motion?

810
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:33,149
Speaker 0: Was that two-mix?

811
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,670
Speaker 1: The White Revolution was that music video that everyone thought was an anime, but it was just a music video.

812
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,950
Speaker 2: I didn't know what I was watching that first day of anime club.

813
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:40,629
Speaker 1: I watched that.

814
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,189
Speaker 1: No, two-mix?

815
00:41:41,551 --> 00:41:43,850
Speaker 1: In high school, me and Ken found it.

816
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,290
Speaker 1: We had this MPEG file, but that shit was hard to play back in the day.

817
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,249
Speaker 2: So when you were at that first anime club meeting in 1/2000, you knew you had already seen that.

818
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,970
Speaker 1: Scott, when I came to that anime club meeting, I already knew who two-mix was.

819
00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:02,110
Speaker 1: I knew White Reflection, and I had seen easily half the anime I've seen in my entire life already.

820
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,268
Speaker 0: High school, man.

821
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,608
Speaker 0: That's just how it was.

822
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:08,510
Speaker 1: Scott, I had already seen most of Slayerz, like Eska Flonay.

823
00:42:09,872 --> 00:42:11,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, Eva's the only thing I hadn't actually watched.

824
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:13,250
Speaker 0: So, okay, no lie.

825
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:21,290
Speaker 0: I have this problem, whereas generally when we discuss the media that I've consumed, generally there are two different categories, and it's like a Venn diagram in which the circles don't touch.

826
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,729
Speaker 0: It's like good media and shit that I've accidentally seen.

827
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:29,466
Speaker 0: And this absolutely applied to me in anime in high school as well.

828
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:45,570
Speaker 0: So I ended up with these fan subs of Tenshi ni Naruman, which is this weird, bubbly, sort of just awkward story about this angel that falls to earth and then falls in love with a dude who's all tsundere about it.

829
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,729
Speaker 2: I've never heard of this.

830
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,930
Speaker 2: It's got a anime news network.

831
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:50,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, Tenshi ni Naruman is the name of it.

832
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,349
Speaker 0: It's patently bad.

833
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,960
Speaker 1: I asked because Luke liked it.

834
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,090
Speaker 1: I ended up seeing some of Rhizal Mine.

835
00:42:58,113 --> 00:42:58,287
Speaker 2: What?

836
00:42:58,891 --> 00:42:59,720
Speaker 2: I completely forgot.

837
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,730
Speaker 2: there was a show called that.

838
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,810
Speaker 2: I have no idea what it's about.

839
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,970
Speaker 1: It has that Hajime Te Shimimasho whatever opening song.

840
00:43:07,072 --> 00:43:08,748
Speaker 1: If you hear that song, you'll be like, "Oh, great

841
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:08,930
Speaker 1: show.".

842
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,407
Speaker 1: I probably will.

843
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:12,390
Speaker 2: How about Alien 9?

844
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,432
Speaker 1: Oh.

845
00:43:13,853 --> 00:43:14,770
Speaker 0: Wow, taking it better.

846
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,230
Speaker 0: That was the one with the creepy hats, right?

847
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:16,510
Speaker 0: Yes.

848
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:16,889
Speaker 0: The creepy hats.

849
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,790
Speaker 2: And the whole plot was in the closer the last episode.

850
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, we all went to eat dinner and Gabi was in the other room watching.

851
00:43:23,272 --> 00:43:24,010
Speaker 1: We watched the end of the show.

852
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,330
Speaker 1: And Gabi was watching the closing credits.

853
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:27,326
Speaker 0: She's like, "Oh, my

854
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:27,490
Speaker 0: God.".

855
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,950
Speaker 2: They just kill everyone in the closing credits of the last episode.

856
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:34,767
Speaker 1: All right, she's credited in Wreck-It Ralph with "additional

857
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:35,289
Speaker 1: voices."

858
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,249
Speaker 1: We got burned.

859
00:43:37,063 --> 00:43:37,190
Speaker 0: Ouch.

860
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,130
Speaker 1: No information.

861
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,250
Speaker 2: Background characters.

862
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:41,210
Speaker 0: No record.

863
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:41,730
Speaker 2: Needs some money.

864
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,990
Speaker 0: Wreck-It Ralph was definitely one of the best things to happen this year.

865
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,188
Speaker 0: And we got Looper this year.

866
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,690
Speaker 0: And Looper, man, I take a lot of shit for Looper as much as I did.

867
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,528
Speaker 2: I haven't seen either one.

868
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:52,229
Speaker 0: Okay.

869
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:58,130
Speaker 0: My thing about Looper is even if it wasn't perfect, I think it represents something important.

870
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,549
Speaker 0: It's like we can have these high-concept movies come into Hollywood and do very well.

871
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,310
Speaker 0: Just as a template, that's a positive thing that I want to see more of, right?

872
00:44:06,432 --> 00:44:08,610
Speaker 0: Even if Prometheus wasn't perfect, I want to see more Prometheus.

873
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,568
Speaker 0: I want to see more Looper.

874
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:11,130
Speaker 0: These are things that I like.

875
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:11,533
Speaker 0: I like that.

876
00:44:11,553 --> 00:44:13,270
Speaker 0: I can go to the movies and see good sci-fi again.

877
00:44:13,511 --> 00:44:18,389
Speaker 1: I heard, though, that the new Bond movie is really good and makes up for the second to most recent Bond movie.

878
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:19,610
Speaker 2: I haven't seen either one.

879
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:20,864
Speaker 2: I only saw Casino Royale.

880
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:28,750
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of people who actually like Bond, like they know Bond, and they call this their second or third favorite Bond ever.

881
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,530
Speaker 2: Well, I've seen every Bond movie up to Casino Royale.

882
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,169
Speaker 2: I just haven't seen the two newest ones.

883
00:44:33,794 --> 00:44:34,329
Speaker 1: It was okay.

884
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:39,329
Speaker 1: The only problem with Casino Royale, in my opinion, is that Casino Royale is the derpiest Bond plot.

885
00:44:40,232 --> 00:44:42,710
Speaker 1: Like it's too close to the original book and all of its derpiness.

886
00:44:43,144 --> 00:44:43,310
Speaker 2: Yeah.

887
00:44:43,512 --> 00:44:44,185
Speaker 2: It was all right.

888
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,670
Speaker 0: Are you talking about the old Casino Royale?

889
00:44:46,932 --> 00:44:48,650
Speaker 1: Oh, with Woody Allen or whatever?

890
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:48,878
Speaker 0: Yeah.

891
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:50,249
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

892
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:51,010
Speaker 0: There was a new one.

893
00:44:51,092 --> 00:44:51,528
Speaker 0: Oh, I see.

894
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,790
Speaker 0: This is what I mean about this Venn diagram, man.

895
00:44:54,115 --> 00:44:54,469
Speaker 0: It's real.

896
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:55,649
Speaker 0: My Venn diagram of media is real.

897
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,849
Speaker 1: Wait, so what was the last James Bond movie you've seen?

898
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:03,929
Speaker 0: It was that one where it's like the software mogul tries to shoot down North America with a space laser.

899
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:04,730
Speaker 0: So what, Pierce Brosnan?

900
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, Pierce Brosnan one.

901
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:07,250
Speaker 0: It wasn't GoldenEye.

902
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:07,588
Speaker 0: No?

903
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,788
Speaker 0: No, it was a Pierce Brosnan one.

904
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:11,470
Speaker 1: I hated Pierce Brosnan's Bond movies.

905
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:13,310
Speaker 1: He was an okay Bond, but his movies were, I just didn't like him.

906
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,610
Speaker 2: Wasn't Pierce Brosnan in GoldenEye?

907
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:15,129
Speaker 1: Yeah.

908
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,209
Speaker 1: That was the only good Bond movie he was in.

909
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:18,429
Speaker 1: He was in a bunch more.

910
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:19,290
Speaker 2: Pretty sure GoldenEye.

911
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,150
Speaker 0: Maybe it was GoldenEye.

912
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:23,050
Speaker 2: Pretty sure GoldenEye is about a space laser on a satellite.

913
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,870
Speaker 0: Maybe.

914
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:24,202
Speaker 0: Yeah.

915
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,361
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm thinking about Dr.

916
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,088
Speaker 0: No, actually.

917
00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:27,177
Speaker 2: Dr.

918
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:27,650
Speaker 0: No is about a rocket.

919
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,167
Speaker 0: No, I like Dr.

920
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:28,249
Speaker 0: No.

921
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:28,574
Speaker 0: Dr.

922
00:45:28,655 --> 00:45:29,869
Speaker 0: No is about a rocket.

923
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,809
Speaker 0: But this was definitely a Pierce Brosnan one.

924
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:33,036
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr.

925
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:33,298
Speaker 2: No is.

926
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:35,170
Speaker 2: Sean Connery is the first Bond movie ever.

927
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:35,990
Speaker 2: It's about a rocket.

928
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:36,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

929
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,169
Speaker 0: That was awesome.

930
00:45:37,678 --> 00:45:37,803
Speaker 0: Dr.

931
00:45:37,823 --> 00:45:37,927
Speaker 2: No.

932
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:40,810
Speaker 1: From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball.

933
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:41,890
Speaker 1: Which I really like.

934
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:42,849
Speaker 2: Thunderball is the best.

935
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,350
Speaker 1: You only live twice on our majesty's Secret Service.

936
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:45,990
Speaker 1: Diamonds are forever.

937
00:45:46,131 --> 00:45:46,487
Speaker 1: Live and let die.

938
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:47,389
Speaker 1: The man with the golden gun.

939
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:48,809
Speaker 2: You don't have to go over the whole list here.

940
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:49,783
Speaker 1: Moonraker.

941
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,390
Speaker 2: Moonraker is the corniest, but I like it anyway.

942
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,830
Speaker 1: Well, because it gave us the Moonraker laser.

943
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:55,649
Speaker 2: Of course.

944
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:56,950
Speaker 0: It was The World Is Not Enough.

945
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:57,630
Speaker 0: That was the one.

946
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,170
Speaker 0: That was the last one that I'd seen was The World Is Not Enough.

947
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:02,170
Speaker 1: Oh, that was like at the peak of everything I hated about Bond.

948
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:02,709
Speaker 0: Exactly.

949
00:46:02,953 --> 00:46:03,749
Speaker 0: And that was the last one.

950
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,770
Speaker 0: So like after that, I was like, well, we're done.

951
00:46:06,293 --> 00:46:07,389
Speaker 0: We're done with Bond for a while.

952
00:46:07,953 --> 00:46:08,044
Speaker 2: Yeah.

953
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:08,565
Speaker 2: All right.

954
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:09,850
Speaker 2: What else?

955
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,068
Speaker 0: So now now I have to see Skyfall, though, I hear it's very good.

956
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,330
Speaker 1: Well, you should probably see Casino Royale first.

957
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:15,690
Speaker 0: OK.

958
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:16,201
Speaker 0: Yeah.

959
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:19,410
Speaker 1: It has one of the better opening credits I've ever seen in a movie theater.

960
00:46:20,635 --> 00:46:21,449
Speaker 1: If that's worth anything.

961
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:22,549
Speaker 2: How long have we gone?

962
00:46:23,095 --> 00:46:23,650
Speaker 1: We can keep going.

963
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:25,929
Speaker 1: We've gone on for forty six minutes.

964
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:26,950
Speaker 2: Not bad.

965
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:28,989
Speaker 0: I mean, ask.

966
00:46:29,211 --> 00:46:29,870
Speaker 0: Ask me anything.

967
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:30,650
Speaker 0: I am a Conrad.

968
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:31,470
Speaker 0: Ask me anything.

969
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:32,330
Speaker 1: All right.

970
00:46:33,052 --> 00:46:35,909
Speaker 1: If you had to give an over/under, how many times have you ejaculated in your entire life?

971
00:46:37,455 --> 00:46:38,390
Speaker 2: It's going to be a big number.

972
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,149
Speaker 0: 365 days in a year.

973
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:43,930
Speaker 1: Now you have to think back to the day when that started happening.

974
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,189
Speaker 0: Well, you know, you're right.

975
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:47,070
Speaker 1: But there's a graph.

976
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,990
Speaker 1: It's got to be weighted.

977
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,390
Speaker 1: There's probably way more in the days of discovery.

978
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,230
Speaker 0: Well, it was weird because I started masturbating before I could ejaculate.

979
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:56,430
Speaker 0: So like now this is a weird question.

980
00:46:57,496 --> 00:46:58,090
Speaker 0: That does happen.

981
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:01,150
Speaker 1: I saw I saw a video of a baby in the womb.

982
00:47:01,412 --> 00:47:02,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

983
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:02,807
Speaker 0: Oh, yikes.

984
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:04,030
Speaker 0: I mean, it makes sense.

985
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,049
Speaker 0: All the wiring is there.

986
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:06,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, man.

987
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,750
Speaker 1: OK, so let's say this is called the kids at home with science.

988
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,210
Speaker 1: This is called a Fermi calculation.

989
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:17,729
Speaker 1: You're attempting to make a broad, generalized guess based on extremely like estimated numbers.

990
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:20,350
Speaker 0: Let's say 15.

991
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,750
Speaker 0: I'm 27.

992
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,758
Speaker 0: So 12 years, 365 days in a year.

993
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,269
Speaker 0: Let's say that there's an average of one time a day.

994
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:32,889
Speaker 0: Somebody can do the math with a calculator because I'm not very good at multiple large number multiplication.

995
00:47:33,492 --> 00:47:37,115
Speaker 0: But it basically comes down to 12 times 365.

996
00:47:37,115 --> 00:47:37,669
Speaker 1: It's not too bad.

997
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,627
Speaker 2: No, not bad at all.

998
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:40,229
Speaker 0: I try really hard.

999
00:47:41,157 --> 00:47:42,589
Speaker 0: You working that bone.

1000
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:44,803
Speaker 0: OK, OK.

1001
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,070
Speaker 0: Speaking of shitty anime, have you guys ever seen Green Green?

1002
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,789
Speaker 2: I never even heard of Green Green.

1003
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:50,789
Speaker 0: It's awful.

1004
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:52,682
Speaker 1: It was the shit anime.

1005
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,030
Speaker 2: Why did jerking off every day remind you of Green Green?

1006
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:06,810
Speaker 0: Because in the opening scene of the first episode, there is a man who introduces himself in this really dramatic way by proclaiming that he's he's masturbated at over 100 strokes a minute and shows his blistered hands.

1007
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:10,069
Speaker 0: That's the image of me you should have right now.

1008
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:12,310
Speaker 1: This is like 2002.

1009
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,350
Speaker 0: I watched this in college.

1010
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,249
Speaker 2: We didn't know about it.

1011
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,669
Speaker 0: My freshman year of college, I watched it.

1012
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,489
Speaker 1: We were there.

1013
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,968
Speaker 1: No, I know.

1014
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,030
Speaker 1: A whole bunch of girls without shirts on.

1015
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:20,868
Speaker 1: One's holding a cactus.

1016
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:21,888
Speaker 1: They're all drinking milk.

1017
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, this is Green Green.

1018
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:30,270
Speaker 0: OK, so in college, my freshman year of college, we used to every every night we would get Gracie's takeout food.

1019
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:33,430
Speaker 0: And we would watch the worst anime we could find.

1020
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,950
Speaker 1: Remember, you remember, Scott, you could fill that you could fill that tray.

1021
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:37,487
Speaker 1: All right.

1022
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,129
Speaker 2: The white styrofoam tray.

1023
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,110
Speaker 1: But you had to be able to close it or they wouldn't let you walk out with it.

1024
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:47,730
Speaker 0: Which what I always end up like half of the time we did this, I would always end up taking an entire styrofoam tray full of waffle crisps.

1025
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,150
Speaker 2: Why didn't you hide a bunch of styrofoam trays in the safety barrel?

1026
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:51,429
Speaker 2: You probably could have gone.

1027
00:48:52,738 --> 00:48:53,129
Speaker 0: Oh, God.

1028
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:53,869
Speaker 0: Safety barrel.

1029
00:48:54,050 --> 00:49:00,350
Speaker 1: Well, I remember when I moved out of RIT and I looked in my dorm and I realized I had like 40 Gracie's glasses and like a bucket full of styrofoam.

1030
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:01,190
Speaker 0: All of that silverware.

1031
00:49:01,495 --> 00:49:02,290
Speaker 0: All of that silverware.

1032
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,290
Speaker 0: We still probably have.

1033
00:49:03,491 --> 00:49:05,649
Speaker 1: I have several Gracie's forks and knives.

1034
00:49:06,472 --> 00:49:10,170
Speaker 2: OK, like I'm not one to be turned on by like, you know, hentai and such, right?

1035
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:11,150
Speaker 2: Animated people.

1036
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:18,710
Speaker 2: Wait, Scott, anytime someone ever says I'm not X, but but if that situation were to occur in real life, that would be pretty amazing.

1037
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:24,010
Speaker 1: Scott, maybe not because she one of these naked girls has a cactus.

1038
00:49:25,172 --> 00:49:26,688
Speaker 1: She looks prepared to use it.

1039
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,488
Speaker 0: But I really like they all have milk.

1040
00:49:29,454 --> 00:49:30,110
Speaker 0: They're all pretty cute.

1041
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:30,886
Speaker 0: I really like milk.

1042
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:32,150
Speaker 2: They're all smiling.

1043
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,350
Speaker 2: They're all having a good time.

1044
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:34,549
Speaker 2: They're not upset or anything.

1045
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:34,890
Speaker 1: Yes.

1046
00:49:35,151 --> 00:49:36,170
Speaker 1: You know, where's Darryl?

1047
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,790
Speaker 1: So I was like, how come they're always crying?

1048
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,026
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1049
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:39,250
Speaker 2: These ones are just like, hey, how's it going?

1050
00:49:40,051 --> 00:49:43,110
Speaker 2: It's almost like they're going to play volleyball in nudist colony or something, which is totally hot.

1051
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,010
Speaker 1: But Scott, the cactus really worries me.

1052
00:49:45,331 --> 00:49:47,329
Speaker 2: Hey, you don't know what the cactus could be for.

1053
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:49,430
Speaker 2: It could be for anything.

1054
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:51,869
Speaker 1: I wonder if that show is worse than Photon.

1055
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:53,888
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

1056
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:54,835
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1057
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:56,230
Speaker 1: We did a show recently.

1058
00:49:56,332 --> 00:49:57,450
Speaker 1: We started talking about Tenchi Muyo.

1059
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,170
Speaker 1: And I remember that I really, really have fond memories.

1060
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,769
Speaker 2: You know what my memory of Photon is?

1061
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:02,730
Speaker 1: A small amount of Tenchi Muyo.

1062
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,150
Speaker 2: Let me tell you my memory of Photon going into media play.

1063
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:08,570
Speaker 2: And every time the Photon DVD was always there in the same spot and it never moved.

1064
00:50:08,892 --> 00:50:10,930
Speaker 2: And I kept seeing it every time I went in there to look through DVDs.

1065
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,429
Speaker 2: And that's what I remember of Photon.

1066
00:50:13,132 --> 00:50:14,710
Speaker 0: I remember about Blockbuster, actually.

1067
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:18,230
Speaker 0: You'd always go into Blockbuster and every time Ninja Scroll would be in the same place.

1068
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,950
Speaker 1: Right next to Doom Megalopolis and Armageddon and Wind of Amnesia.

1069
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:23,585
Speaker 0: Fucking Wind of Amnesia.

1070
00:50:25,036 --> 00:50:25,889
Speaker 1: I remember watching that.

1071
00:50:26,071 --> 00:50:27,870
Speaker 1: I thought it was the deepest thing ever.

1072
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:28,990
Speaker 1: I was like, "This is amazing.

1073
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:29,650
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

1074
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:30,730
Speaker 1: This is society.

1075
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:31,017
Speaker 1: This is

1076
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:31,264
Speaker 1: deep.".

1077
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,528
Speaker 1: And then at the end, it's like, "Oh, they're having sex

1078
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:33,730
Speaker 1: now.".

1079
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,786
Speaker 1: Then my mom walks in and I'm like, "I swear it wasn't like this until just

1080
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,108
Speaker 1: now.".

1081
00:50:37,972 --> 00:50:41,047
Speaker 1: And then there's this moment burning my brain where just as my mom is like,

1082
00:50:41,087 --> 00:50:41,409
Speaker 1: "Really?"

1083
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:43,910
Speaker 1: He is nibbling on her nipple.

1084
00:50:44,677 --> 00:50:44,910
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1085
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:45,690
Speaker 0: It gets really into it.

1086
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:46,669
Speaker 2: Well, she didn't bring a cactus.

1087
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,210
Speaker 2: Of course, he's going to nibble if you don't have any cactus protection.

1088
00:50:52,624 --> 00:50:53,940
Speaker 0: And she's wearing gloves too, man.

1089
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:54,499
Speaker 0: She's ready.

1090
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:55,919
Speaker 1: She's got gloves on both hands.

1091
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,413
Speaker 1: Oh, I know.

1092
00:50:57,046 --> 00:50:58,020
Speaker 0: She's serious about that cactus, man.

1093
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,719
Speaker 1: She is the cutest of these four girls too.

1094
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,256
Speaker 0: Oh, I know.

1095
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:01,437
Speaker 1: That hair.

1096
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,478
Speaker 0: Yes, that's right.

1097
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,520
Speaker 0: We watched this.

1098
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,999
Speaker 0: We watched Midori no Hibi.

1099
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:06,120
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

1100
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:06,615
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1101
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,498
Speaker 1: I watched one episode of that and I was like, "That is

1102
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:08,640
Speaker 1: enough.".

1103
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,740
Speaker 2: Is that the one with the puppet hand?

1104
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:09,907
Speaker 2: Yes.

1105
00:51:10,102 --> 00:51:10,192
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1106
00:51:10,361 --> 00:51:11,780
Speaker 0: It was the shit anime tour, man.

1107
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:13,400
Speaker 0: We watched all the worst stuff.

1108
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,160
Speaker 0: We watched Fullmetal Panic, which was good.

1109
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,160
Speaker 0: And then we watched Fullmetal Panic Fumofu.

1110
00:51:17,623 --> 00:51:18,478
Speaker 2: And that was not.

1111
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:20,210
Speaker 1: That was a travesty, man.

1112
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,600
Speaker 0: That was the bait and switch of the moratorium.

1113
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,720
Speaker 2: I watched one episode of Fumofu.

1114
00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:25,939
Speaker 0: We watched two, which was tough.

1115
00:51:26,221 --> 00:51:28,718
Speaker 1: It was like, "Hey, remember this thing that was pretty good that you kind of

1116
00:51:28,738 --> 00:51:28,980
Speaker 1: liked?".

1117
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:29,414
Speaker 1: It was okay.

1118
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,240
Speaker 1: We're going to shit all over.

1119
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,100
Speaker 2: Regular Fullmetal Panic was pretty much a straightforward anime, you know, a little school humor and a little robot fighting.

1120
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:37,615
Speaker 1: And then... Decent plot.

1121
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,858
Speaker 2: Fumofu was just, "Where'd the robot fighting

1122
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:39,919
Speaker 2: go?".

1123
00:51:41,087 --> 00:51:41,540
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

1124
00:51:41,741 --> 00:51:44,699
Speaker 0: I don't know if I've asked you guys what you all think about Haruhi.

1125
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:46,399
Speaker 2: I think it's awesome.

1126
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,620
Speaker 2: I have only seen a few episodes.

1127
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:48,956
Speaker 1: The original Haruhi?

1128
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:49,976
Speaker 1: Like the first...

1129
00:51:50,163 --> 00:51:50,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

1130
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,280
Speaker 0: The very first incarnation.

1131
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,620
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what order to watch them.

1132
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,400
Speaker 2: Whatever episodes I saw were all right.

1133
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:54,934
Speaker 2: I would watch more.

1134
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:56,519
Speaker 0: I watched them in broadcast order.

1135
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:57,999
Speaker 1: That's how I watched them.

1136
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,399
Speaker 1: You know what?

1137
00:51:58,844 --> 00:51:59,940
Speaker 1: I think it was a brilliant show.

1138
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,060
Speaker 1: I thought it was really heartwarming.

1139
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,040
Speaker 1: I really, really, really liked it.

1140
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,199
Speaker 0: Dude, I actually did too.

1141
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:09,400
Speaker 0: And I get mixed reactions when I ask people about it, which is why I was curious as to what you all thought about it.

1142
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:09,697
Speaker 0: I'm trying to...

1143
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,260
Speaker 1: I don't want to speak about it too much because Scott hasn't seen it.

1144
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,069
Speaker 0: I don't really want...

1145
00:52:14,242 --> 00:52:17,040
Speaker 1: What it is actually about is what makes that show Haruhi.

1146
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,520
Speaker 2: Pretty sure I know what it's already about.

1147
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,360
Speaker 1: What do you think it's about?

1148
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,398
Speaker 1: This is interesting because Scott recently enlightened the fact that he's never read or seen Macbeth.

1149
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:28,339
Speaker 1: So I asked him to explain to me what he thinks Macbeth is about.

1150
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,040
Speaker 2: So Scott, what's Haruhi about?

1151
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,940
Speaker 1: What is Haruhi about?

1152
00:52:32,261 --> 00:52:33,420
Speaker 0: You just changed my entire perspective.

1153
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,239
Speaker 2: There's some aliens.

1154
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:34,914
Speaker 2: I know that.

1155
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:36,139
Speaker 2: And they're real.

1156
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:42,440
Speaker 2: And this girl really wants to find the aliens and everyone around her is actually the aliens.

1157
00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:44,138
Speaker 2: But she doesn't know that.

1158
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,290
Speaker 1: There is a meta...

1159
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,920
Speaker 2: And it's also time traveling.

1160
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:55,420
Speaker 1: You're correct, except that there is a meta... You've got what the Prince of Nothing is about, but not what it's about.

1161
00:52:56,162 --> 00:52:57,615
Speaker 2: So I don't see the consult.

1162
00:52:57,676 --> 00:52:58,140
Speaker 2: is what you're saying?

1163
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,140
Speaker 1: No, there's a consult.

1164
00:52:59,320 --> 00:52:59,778
Speaker 1: I'll put it like that.

1165
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,160
Speaker 1: Okay.

1166
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:00,899
Speaker 1: There's a meta.

1167
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,980
Speaker 1: The show is one step deeper than that.

1168
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:03,479
Speaker 2: That's good.

1169
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,840
Speaker 2: That means there's a reason to watch.

1170
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,580
Speaker 1: That is why the show is good and worth watching.

1171
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,819
Speaker 1: Unlike Scrap Princess, which was really fun, but...

1172
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,860
Speaker 2: So sad truth.

1173
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:14,119
Speaker 2: I know more about Haruhi, which I've only watched a couple episodes, than I know about Macbeth.

1174
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:19,580
Speaker 0: This is like the affliction that we all have, like 80s anime watchers.

1175
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,500
Speaker 0: This is what we take home at the end of the day.

1176
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,300
Speaker 1: Well, look at what just happened in our group, just now, this discussion.

1177
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:33,740
Speaker 1: The culture of connected people in the world, at least in the Western industrialized world, is that any conversation, no media is sacred.

1178
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:42,010
Speaker 1: In any group of people, there's going to be the same reaction to... If anyone says any name of a movie, no matter how famous, someone in the room will not have seen it, and everyone else goes,

1179
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:42,696
Speaker 1: "What?".

1180
00:53:43,325 --> 00:53:43,819
Speaker 2: Think about it.

1181
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,160
Speaker 2: You've never seen the West Indies?

1182
00:53:47,342 --> 00:53:48,280
Speaker 2: Think about this, right?

1183
00:53:48,962 --> 00:53:51,680
Speaker 2: I say this a lot, I might have said it on the show 10 or 12 times already.

1184
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,459
Speaker 2: A kid was just born, just now, somewhere in the world, right?

1185
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:04,576
Speaker 2: Hasn't seen Star Wars, hasn't seen anything ever, hasn't played any video game, hasn't played any... And meanwhile, we're making things faster than that kid can possibly even play one game or whatever, right?

1186
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:12,239
Speaker 2: So yeah, starting now, and starting actually a long time ago, no one's ever going to see or hear or play all the things.

1187
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:16,758
Speaker 2: No matter who you find, it's going to be like, "You don't know the

1188
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:17,120
Speaker 2: whatever?".

1189
00:54:17,262 --> 00:54:17,939
Speaker 2: Of course not.

1190
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:18,816
Speaker 2: This isn't possible.

1191
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,120
Speaker 0: We've been discussing this a lot, particularly as we've been watching Adventure Time at my house.

1192
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:24,540
Speaker 1: I'm really digging Adventure Time.

1193
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,680
Speaker 2: I'm going to start watching Adventure Time pretty soon.

1194
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:28,060
Speaker 1: Scott, it's like Venture Brothers.

1195
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,179
Speaker 2: I know what it's about.

1196
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:34,280
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying first season is super fun, but then once you start to get it and kind of get these characters...

1197
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,980
Speaker 2: It's all about the secret apocalypse of the past.

1198
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,380
Speaker 1: It's also just like, it really grows on you in a way that you wouldn't expect.

1199
00:54:39,801 --> 00:54:54,640
Speaker 0: It does, but what really interests me is that the inspiration and the template work that these guys are building off of is very, very clear in a lot of cases, and yet they bring their own really unique and distinct voice to this.

1200
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,585
Speaker 0: So you can say, "Well, there's a kid out there who has never seen Star Wars or who maybe will never see Sailor Moon,".

1201
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:09,257
Speaker 0: and to a degree, they have received at least a part of that because they're part of this conversation, I think, that is ongoing.

1202
00:55:11,282 --> 00:55:13,340
Speaker 0: I'm not doing a good job of encapsulating in some kind of rambling.

1203
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:13,880
Speaker 0: I apologize.

1204
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:20,320
Speaker 0: But it's very cool to see how all of that stuff that we consider really sacred will appear to the next generation of people.

1205
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,419
Speaker 0: I think that's very, very cool.

1206
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:33,260
Speaker 0: And I'm really happy that we have people like Frederator working on stuff like this because they're doing it in absolutely all the right ways, and I think Wreck-It Ralph is another good example of how to kind of respect the past while creating something for the future.

1207
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,880
Speaker 2: Did you see that episode that the Adventure Time people put onto this other show on YouTube?

1208
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,550
Speaker 2: It was like...

1209
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,120
Speaker 0: Oh, with Cartoon Hangover.

1210
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,399
Speaker 0: I believe it was called like Awesomenauts or something similar?

1211
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,777
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't Awesomenauts, but it was basically like these, you know, what the hell was the name of it?

1212
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,219
Speaker 1: Not Superjail.

1213
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:47,602
Speaker 2: No.

1214
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,479
Speaker 0: Oh, that was something else.

1215
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,580
Speaker 1: Oh, give me... I don't even know what that is.

1216
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:58,419
Speaker 1: I just keep... YouTube, until recently, has recommended to me nothing but that He-Man, yeah, yeah, yeah Because you've watched that a thousand times.

1217
00:55:58,681 --> 00:55:59,158
Speaker 1: And My Little Pony.

1218
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:02,140
Speaker 1: And lately, it's been recommending to me Superjail.

1219
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,480
Speaker 0: I wasn't impressed with Superjail.

1220
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,220
Speaker 0: I just don't think it was my kind of show.

1221
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,400
Speaker 0: I don't think it was my kind of humor.

1222
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:10,700
Speaker 0: And I'm not even attempting to make a value judgment.

1223
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,046
Speaker 0: It wasn't for me.

1224
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,278
Speaker 1: It wasn't for me.

1225
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,540
Speaker 1: We have similar tastes lately.

1226
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,718
Speaker 1: I mean, Gravity Falls is rockin' it.

1227
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,700
Speaker 0: Gravity Falls is phenomenal.

1228
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,780
Speaker 1: It's got some flaws, but we didn't show it.

1229
00:56:18,802 --> 00:56:18,956
Speaker 0: It does.

1230
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:19,418
Speaker 0: It does.

1231
00:56:20,021 --> 00:56:24,552
Speaker 0: And in the context that nothing is perfect, I think that Gravity Falls is very good, you know?

1232
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,020
Speaker 0: And I think it's just good to see all this really good creative work coming to light.

1233
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,139
Speaker 0: that's also just very popular and making a lot of money.

1234
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,680
Speaker 0: This is what I've always said.

1235
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:41,199
Speaker 0: I've always said that making a good product is very difficult, but once, you know, you've put in the time and you've managed to create something good, pretty much success follows naturally.

1236
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,860
Speaker 0: And so part of what I do at Muse is, you know, we all try to focus on that point.

1237
00:56:46,621 --> 00:56:48,600
Speaker 0: We try to make a good game above all else.

1238
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:49,216
Speaker 0: That's it.

1239
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,740
Speaker 0: This is our one objective.

1240
00:56:52,422 --> 00:57:02,840
Speaker 0: And the last game I made, Crevers, wasn't perfect, but I can very easily now isolate the flaws with, you know, the way I ran the project, the flaws with the way I coded the project and the flaws with the way that we created the project.

1241
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,080
Speaker 0: And I think that it was like a really necessary speed bump to a degree on the way to Guns of Icarus.

1242
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:08,426
Speaker 0: And, you know, I'm just.

1243
00:57:09,069 --> 00:57:11,280
Speaker 0: it's making a good product is the most important part.

1244
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:13,119
Speaker 0: And I really do think people lose sight of that fact.

1245
00:57:13,603 --> 00:57:15,240
Speaker 2: The name of that new show is Bravest Warriors.

1246
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,595
Speaker 2: That's the way this Warriors.

1247
00:57:16,636 --> 00:57:16,940
Speaker 0: Thank you.

1248
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,732
Speaker 2: I watched the little thing.

1249
00:57:17,752 --> 00:57:18,138
Speaker 2: It was cute.

1250
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:19,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was cute.

1251
00:57:20,081 --> 00:57:21,419
Speaker 2: And I mean, one guy looks like Mega Man.

1252
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:25,160
Speaker 0: I think cartoon, Cartoon Hangover is doing this thing now where you can pitch them anything.

1253
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:26,052
Speaker 2: Really?

1254
00:57:26,114 --> 00:57:26,339
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1255
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,620
Speaker 2: And I'll pitch you something.

1256
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,524
Speaker 0: They will.

1257
00:57:28,826 --> 00:57:30,600
Speaker 0: They will like, man.

1258
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,202
Speaker 1: So get this.

1259
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:34,620
Speaker 1: I'm kidnapped and put in a dungeon and there's this dragon.

1260
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:36,719
Speaker 2: There's also a ghost.

1261
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,720
Speaker 0: No, the dragon isn't the ghost.

1262
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,580
Speaker 0: You see the ghost incidental to the dragon.

1263
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,020
Speaker 0: The dragon has the juiciest B hole in town.

1264
00:57:43,622 --> 00:57:46,940
Speaker 0: However, slimy, scaly stick around.

1265
00:57:47,361 --> 00:57:47,642
Speaker 2: He does.

1266
00:57:48,346 --> 00:57:50,900
Speaker 0: You should actually let me close this out with a rap segment.

1267
00:57:51,783 --> 00:58:00,020
Speaker 2: Mark, if you're going to close out with a rap segment, you should preempt by pimping yourself, promoting the things that you would like people to.

1268
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,500
Speaker 0: I'm actually not going to do a rap segment.

1269
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:09,818
Speaker 0: The only rap lyrics I know are both fake rap lyrics and insanely offensive and feature either any other kind.

1270
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:17,300
Speaker 1: Nothing could be worse than when Tycho did that rap about the prostate at Pax prostate rather barely.

1271
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,520
Speaker 2: I remember he did it.

1272
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,900
Speaker 1: I don't remember the way I have it in my like mashup of Pax Prime one year.

1273
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,679
Speaker 1: I'm going to isolate that and make a separate video of it and link to it.

1274
00:58:25,842 --> 00:58:25,907
Speaker 1: OK.

1275
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:28,319
Speaker 1: It's an insidious cluster.

1276
00:58:28,523 --> 00:58:29,478
Speaker 1: But anyway, dick ballista.

1277
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,898
Speaker 2: Promote your shamelessly self promote your things, which you've already done.

1278
00:58:33,918 --> 00:58:34,780
Speaker 2: some of my name.

1279
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,980
Speaker 0: My name is Conrad Kraling.

1280
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,680
Speaker 0: Right now I'm working at Muse games.

1281
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:41,540
Speaker 0: I was one of the senior engineers on guns of Icarus.

1282
00:58:41,641 --> 00:58:43,540
Speaker 0: I was project lead on our last game, Crevers.

1283
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:45,240
Speaker 0: I did the Johnny wander website.

1284
00:58:46,103 --> 00:58:48,220
Speaker 0: I am on Johnny wander, Johnny wander.com.

1285
00:58:49,302 --> 00:58:51,220
Speaker 0: You'll probably see a lot more of me in the near future.

1286
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,539
Speaker 0: I have some cool stuff coming up.

1287
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,780
Speaker 0: I'm very excited to share that with you guys.

1288
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,099
Speaker 1: You should all cosplay as Conrad at conventions.

1289
00:58:57,783 --> 00:58:58,900
Speaker 0: Yes, that's that's right.

1290
00:58:59,101 --> 00:58:59,900
Speaker 0: It's really hard.

1291
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,056
Speaker 0: You just have to not get a haircut and wear a T-shirt that you stole from somebody two years ago.

1292
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,020
Speaker 2: If you need if you need a reference picture, just buy a bottle of what's that stuff?

1293
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,038
Speaker 1: Oh, that's soju.

1294
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:09,432
Speaker 1: Soju.

1295
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,300
Speaker 0: Just buy a bottle.

1296
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,140
Speaker 0: Buy a bottle of Chamey Sewell Original and take a look at the guy holding it.

1297
00:59:14,281 --> 00:59:14,490
Speaker 0: That's me.

1298
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:14,956
Speaker 0: Yep.

1299
00:59:15,661 --> 00:59:17,959
Speaker 0: Chamey Sewell Original, by the way, is the only soju you should drink the end.

1300
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:19,120
Speaker 0: The only.

1301
00:59:19,786 --> 00:59:20,180
Speaker 0: That's the one.

1302
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:21,060
Speaker 2: Well, you endorse it.

1303
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,454
Speaker 2: You're on it.

1304
00:59:22,323 --> 00:59:23,720
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, obviously they pay me the right.

1305
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:23,816
Speaker 2: Yeah.

1306
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,913
Speaker 2: I feel like if William Williams told you to drink St.

1307
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:26,960
Speaker 2: Paint, it's not going to happen.

1308
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:28,657
Speaker 1: It is no worse.

1309
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:29,800
Speaker 0: Nobody is surprised.

1310
00:59:36,262 --> 00:59:38,400
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1311

1318
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:33,650
