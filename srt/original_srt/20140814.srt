1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,199
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, August 14th, 2014.

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:13,589
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:14,488
Speaker 0: And I'm Emily.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,010
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, The Daily Show.

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:24,290
Speaker 1: And last week tonight, Let's Do This.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,009
Speaker 1: I guess Scott is here only in spirit and in the bumper that I'm going to leave in.

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,710
Speaker 0: Well, he was supposed to do a Wednesday show yesterday and you'd...

8
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:37,568
Speaker 1: Well, we had stuff to do.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I figured.

10
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:38,908
Speaker 1: Stuff's going on.

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:47,790
Speaker 0: But at first we were going to do an animation and comic show, but then I realized that we really haven't been reading a lot of the same comics.

12
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,868
Speaker 0: So I was like, "Eh, maybe we'll just do a show about how we like political

13
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:52,229
Speaker 0: shows.".

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,250
Speaker 0: Because Scott never wants to talk about politics and he has no interest in The Daily Show or all those other satire shows.

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:58,562
Speaker 1: Yep.

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,898
Speaker 1: Kind of like how I'm also thinking about Skyping.

17
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:07,009
Speaker 1: maybe Andrew in because we're tweet about Ukraine buddies and no one else seems to give a shit.

18
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:07,534
Speaker 0: Yeah.

19
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:08,469
Speaker 0: I don't know.

20
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:10,070
Speaker 0: Stuff's been pretty rough.

21
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,646
Speaker 0: Every time I look at the news lately, I'm just kind of depressed, especially these past few days.

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:26,356
Speaker 1: Well, I'll admit and it's a little bit dark to think this, but as much as this is a bad things are happening, aside from the fact that things are still pretty much better than they've been in most points in history.

23
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:34,170
Speaker 1: for most people, it's a little exciting because it's all the sort of geopolitical weirdo crap that's really fun to analyze.

24
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:34,909
Speaker 0: It's awful.

25
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:35,708
Speaker 0: It's awful.

26
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,309
Speaker 1: But I can say that because I have no control over it.

27
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,130
Speaker 1: It's like if you hope there's a crazy thunderstorm because thunderstorms are awesome.

28
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,210
Speaker 1: It's not your fault if the thunderstorm is a little too crazy and people die.

29
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:51,929
Speaker 0: The worst thing is like a lot of the stuff that's happening in Iraq and stuff like that, you could see it coming from a long time ago.

30
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,207
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean like when we invaded Iraq?

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

32
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:04,809
Speaker 0: Like this is a decades building problem and it's like you see it start and you can't do anything about it, but you're like, "Oh, if only people had known then what we know

33
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:05,050
Speaker 0: now.".

34
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,750
Speaker 1: But they did know then what we know now.

35
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,070
Speaker 0: They did.

36
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,850
Speaker 1: And people said it over and over again.

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,568
Speaker 1: They just gave zero fucks.

38
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,449
Speaker 0: But it didn't make any difference.

39
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:12,046
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

40
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:20,647
Speaker 0: Basically, Rym and I, when we read the news or we're mad about this stuff, I'll come home and we'll like bitch at each other like, "Oh, the news, it is so

41
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:21,190
Speaker 0: unhappy.".

42
00:02:21,452 --> 00:02:23,608
Speaker 0: And Scott's like, "Why are you guys talking about

43
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:23,810
Speaker 0: this?".

44
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,650
Speaker 1: Of course, lately he's mad that I even talk about Sailor Moon Crystal.

45
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,710
Speaker 1: He's like, "Why would you talk about it?

46
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,176
Speaker 1: That anime is

47
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:29,663
Speaker 1: terrible.".

48
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:31,984
Speaker 1: Which he's correct, but...

49
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,470
Speaker 0: Scott doesn't understand the catharsis in complaining about things you don't like.

50
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:40,009
Speaker 1: Should we just do the whole show talking about Scott?

51
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:40,888
Speaker 0: Infident complaining.

52
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,450
Speaker 0: But no, because we got other stuff to talk about.

53
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,190
Speaker 0: We're going to go...

54
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:53,610
Speaker 1: So, in personal news, way back when we moved out of Beacon and moved up to New York City, we had a change jar that was pretty much full at that point already.

55
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:54,328
Speaker 0: Oh, the change jar.

56
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:55,809
Speaker 1: So, while we were moving...

57
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:56,388
Speaker 0: My job.

58
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:03,477
Speaker 1: ...our unbonded, dodgy Georgian movers, they saw the change jar and they were like... "We'll give you $300 for

59
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:03,598
Speaker 1: it.".

60
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,430
Speaker 0: So instead...

61
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,290
Speaker 1: Is it worth $300?

62
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,049
Speaker 1: They were trying to guess.

63
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:14,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were trying to like... You know those things at the county fair where they're like, "Guess how many kernels of popcorn are in this

64
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,645
Speaker 0: jar.".

65
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:16,530
Speaker 0: And then you get a prize if you guess right.

66
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:22,089
Speaker 0: They were basically trying to gamble on the fact that they were guessing low balling this change jar.

67
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,884
Speaker 1: Now, I guessed, and I'm really proud of myself, that this jar had about $650 in it of change.

68
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:35,150
Speaker 0: It was $643, not counting the random singles, the paper singles that you threw in it.

69
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:35,649
Speaker 1: And the colognes.

70
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,370
Speaker 0: And the colognes and the Namco tokens, which always got sorted into the quarter.

71
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:47,006
Speaker 0: So basically, for years, this thing has been full, and we've been putting our change in the money hat...

72
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,730
Speaker 1: Into a top hat, like a fake top hat.

73
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,110
Speaker 1: So we've just had this thing, and it's too heavy for me to carry.

74
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,670
Speaker 0: This enormous pretzel jar.

75
00:03:56,912 --> 00:04:00,930
Speaker 1: The free penny arcade came and went in the era when we had this change jar.

76
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,350
Speaker 0: And so the bad thing is there's not a lot of coin stars in the area.

77
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,788
Speaker 0: And so every time... And we don't have a car.

78
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,830
Speaker 1: And Coinstar, I've read more and more, seems to be pretty inaccurate and shitty.

79
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:15,210
Speaker 1: And they take a cut unless you do the Amazon thing, which isn't always available.

80
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,148
Speaker 0: It's not always available.

81
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,130
Speaker 1: Not excited about Coinstar.

82
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:24,668
Speaker 0: So I was like, you know, we'd have a car, like we'd rent a Zipcar or something and be like, "Hey, do you want to swing by the house and get the change

83
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:24,849
Speaker 0: jar?".

84
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:27,165
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Nah, let's deal with that

85
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:27,689
Speaker 0: later.".

86
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,100
Speaker 1: I was like,

87
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:28,370
Speaker 1: "Whatever.".

88
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,410
Speaker 0: I was like, "But there's so much money in there.

89
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,765
Speaker 0: We need to unlock the potential of this change

90
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:33,047
Speaker 0: jar.".

91
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,146
Speaker 0: And so finally I was like, "Fuck

92
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:35,227
Speaker 0: it.".

93
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,530
Speaker 0: And I bought this cheapo hand-cranked money sorter.

94
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,910
Speaker 1: A best-rated one on Amazon.

95
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:49,850
Speaker 0: And so last weekend, in order to procrastinate on my writing, I just sorted all the change in the apartment into little rolls.

96
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,310
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that there were basically no quarters near the top, because we'd been mining them out for laundry.

97
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,010
Speaker 1: But I used to go deep into the layers, like different years, like quarters start to appear.

98
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,670
Speaker 1: Because back then, I had no use for quarters.

99
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:07,348
Speaker 0: Apartment dwellers, they've got to understand, like, quarters are the most valuable of all chains.

100
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,450
Speaker 1: Seriously, I still, to this day, really don't like doing laundry and laundromats.

101
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:23,010
Speaker 1: I have always really hated it, because I don't trust the personal hygiene or ability to use washers and dryers of pretty much anyone outside of my closed circle of friends.

102
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:33,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just like that you're kind of tied to the place, like you're like, "Okay, in exactly 23 minutes, I need to go down, otherwise somebody will take my stuff

103
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:33,710
Speaker 0: out.".

104
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:36,850
Speaker 1: I just don't trust that someone's not going to put some stinky shit in there.

105
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:38,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, well sometimes they smell like diapers.

106
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,767
Speaker 0: So it's like, then you're always like, "Did they just wash cloth diapers right before I went, oh

107
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:43,869
Speaker 0: no.".

108
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,490
Speaker 1: Also, that girl who started a fire because she put like a plastic bag in there.

109
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,790
Speaker 0: Seriously, I have said it once, I'll say it a million times.

110
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:59,570
Speaker 0: If you reach the age of 18 and go to college or something without knowing how to do basic stuff like wash your own clothes- I think at that point they just have to put you down.

111
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:04,721
Speaker 1: No, seriously, you need to go to- Like an old yeller, they just take you out back, they're like, "Sorry, she never learned how to do

112
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:05,030
Speaker 1: laundry.".

113
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,069
Speaker 0: I just think you don't graduate high school.

114
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,669
Speaker 0: Think about the rabbits.

115
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,310
Speaker 1: Think about the rabbits.

116
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:16,610
Speaker 0: Anyway, but it's like, you know, you should have to, that should be a requirement for graduating high school.

117
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,750
Speaker 1: They should lock you in prison and you only get out if you successfully do laundry.

118
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,087
Speaker 0: Or cook an egg without setting off the fire detector or something.

119
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,270
Speaker 1: I remember an unnamed person we knew at RIT tried to cook instead of the fire alarm and I was like- Not the popcorn thing.

120
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,349
Speaker 1: That was a different gentleman who got expelled for that.

121
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,748
Speaker 1: But after this happens, I was like, "What the fuck did you

122
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:36,929
Speaker 1: do?".

123
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,687
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Show me how you cooked

124
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:38,949
Speaker 1: that."

125
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:43,065
Speaker 1: And I watch him cook it and I don't- And you're like,

126
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:43,389
Speaker 1: "Incorrect.".

127
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:51,669
Speaker 1: Don't think he realized that that knob above the stove turned on the grease fan or what a grease fan was.

128
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,007
Speaker 1: The apartment was a cloud of grease and I still don't know how he started the fire the previous time.

129
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:57,579
Speaker 1: Grease?

130
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,235
Speaker 1: But how?

131
00:06:59,276 --> 00:06:59,969
Speaker 1: what sparked it?

132
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,750
Speaker 1: What started it?

133
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,989
Speaker 1: Because it was grease in the air.

134
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,048
Speaker 0: Aerosolized grease.

135
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,750
Speaker 0: Aerosolized grease.

136
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,130
Speaker 1: Doesn't catch fire that quickly.

137
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,589
Speaker 1: I think he must have dropped the egg into the- I don't even know.

138
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,470
Speaker 0: Let's just pretend this never happened.

139
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:14,110
Speaker 1: In the news, I think it is worth talking about a little bit.

140
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:24,684
Speaker 1: If you haven't been paying attention to Twitter, which is pretty much the only place you can pay attention to this on because the regular news- You almost said mainstream news and then you caught yourself because that's a buzzword, isn't it?

141
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,549
Speaker 0: That's what was going on.

142
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,046
Speaker 1: The lame stream media.

143
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:42,789
Speaker 1: They covered it really superficially, but basically there have been multiple days of riots and police issues in Ferguson in the former Confederacy, which is what I refer to all southern states as.

144
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,130
Speaker 0: It's not just riots.

145
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:53,747
Speaker 0: Some of it has been organized protests and some of it has been- There was times of a bunch of shops got busted up.

146
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:03,610
Speaker 1: Regardless of what sparked it, there was a protest the first night and then that devolved by some individuals into riot looting and burning down of at least one business.

147
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:04,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty rough.

148
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,506
Speaker 1: Basically, this whole story is important to pay attention to partially.

149
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:39,667
Speaker 1: as for you kids out there, you nerds, because this is another example of one of those things where social media is way faster and really is the only direct source of news, but at the same time, if you actually just follow the tags or Twitter in the location as opposed to, I don't know, having some sense and reading filters, I mean, people were reporting like real tanks rolling in and martial law and snipers shooting people in the street and all this stuff that didn't happen.

150
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:39,958
Speaker 0: That's it.

151
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:40,929
Speaker 0: That's crazy.

152
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,689
Speaker 0: It's just the people who live there are being like, "This is the crazy shit that's happening to us right now.

153
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,055
Speaker 0: This is

154
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:47,462
Speaker 0: horrible.".

155
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,590
Speaker 0: I think that's the important thing.

156
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,390
Speaker 0: You're able to interface with people who are directly involved in these situations.

157
00:08:56,512 --> 00:09:04,829
Speaker 0: I remember the first time it really hit home for me was during the protests in Iran a number of years ago.

158
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,230
Speaker 0: It was like four years ago or something during that uprising after the election.

159
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:17,070
Speaker 0: You just see tweets of random students who are my age who are just like, "Here's what's happening.

160
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,979
Speaker 0: Everybody gather

161
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:18,242
Speaker 0: here.".

162
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:26,290
Speaker 0: They tweet in English often because that would get people in the Western world aware of the situation.

163
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:36,685
Speaker 0: This is a case where you just see photographs of people's Instagram, and it's like, "Look, it's on fire," or, "Look, this SWAT team has a rifle pointed at my

164
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:37,046
Speaker 0: friend.".

165
00:09:38,531 --> 00:09:45,663
Speaker 0: I think that kind of visibility is one of the most important things for these situations because I think like...

166
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,545
Speaker 1: What's happening now is not different from what has happened countless times in many towns.

167
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,289
Speaker 1: The only difference is that now people are seeing actual photos of what it looks like when the police act that way.

168
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:09,689
Speaker 1: Maybe societies realize they don't have much of a stomach for it, though interestingly, a lot of the more conservative types seem to be pretty much cheering on the police because those people are lawless.

169
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:21,850
Speaker 0: I think it's one of those things where people in the United States can sometimes get very complacent about the really rather shitty state of our race relations here.

170
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:35,609
Speaker 0: It's like incidents like what happened in Ferguson really brings to the forefront that, yes, as a society, we have these issues that are still running beneath the whole surface of our culture, and they need to be addressed.

171
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:39,410
Speaker 1: They're caused by such long-term systemic issues.

172
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:39,804
Speaker 1: Exactly.

173
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,201
Speaker 1: There's a town that was primarily white and middle

174
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:43,722
Speaker 0: class that

175
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:59,470
Speaker 1: over decades became predominantly black, but yet the vast majority of the police force, all elected offices and basically all civil service are white and people who either live on the outskirts of town or live in neighboring towns or suburbs, which is a lot like Detroit.

176
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:10,750
Speaker 1: I remember when I was a kid, my dad and every fireman he knew, there were laws that said if you were a fireman, you had to live inside of the city limits of Detroit because they were trying to have people in the neighborhoods have these jobs.

177
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,690
Speaker 1: Pretty much no fireman lived in Detroit.

178
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,190
Speaker 0: They all cheated.

179
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,250
Speaker 0: They had one apartment that everybody would share, and that was their mailing address.

180
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:24,529
Speaker 1: One bedroom house has 19 firemen living in it, and everyone was okay with that because that's how it rolled.

181
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:28,750
Speaker 1: He would occasionally spend the night there and leave some stuff there.

182
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:33,330
Speaker 1: It was the same situation exactly, but you can read the news for all this stuff.

183
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:39,250
Speaker 1: If you're learning about this now from us on Geek Nights, what the fuck, kid?

184
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,868
Speaker 0: Go look at the internet for, you know.

185
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:42,880
Speaker 1: Things to look at.

186
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:51,930
Speaker 1: One, why do the police in these dumpy little towns have extremely high tech- Well, assault rifles I can see.

187
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,068
Speaker 1: Why do they have tanks?

188
00:11:53,531 --> 00:12:01,550
Speaker 1: All this riot gear and all this crazy crap, and the answer is mostly military surplus and programs after 9/11 to distribute anti-terror stuff.

189
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,988
Speaker 1: So, a whole bunch of pork and BS.

190
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,529
Speaker 1: Pay attention to how that happens.

191
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:27,347
Speaker 1: And two, on the journalism thing, it amazes me that the people who are doing this, like the police and the town and everyone involved, are so slow to respond to social media that basically their side of the story isn't even appearing except as told by normal news the next day.

192
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:31,869
Speaker 1: It amazes me that the mayor wasn't reacting or the governor wasn't reacting immediately.

193
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,430
Speaker 0: Maybe they're worried that they're trying to gauge their PR stuff, you know?

194
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the silence is worse.

195
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,479
Speaker 0: I know, I know, because the silence looks bad like, "Oh, how are we going to spin this sort of

196
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:44,725
Speaker 0: deal?".

197
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,410
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's what I assume.

198
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:53,489
Speaker 0: It's like they're worried they're going to fuck up or that they have fucked up major big time and so they're- Now you fucked up.

199
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:54,230
Speaker 0: Obviously.

200
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:57,969
Speaker 0: But I'm guessing that's why they haven't been on.

201
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,289
Speaker 0: It's not that they're unable to interface with social media.

202
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,385
Speaker 1: I think they are unable to interface because they don't seem to realize how the things they're doing look.

203
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:11,590
Speaker 1: They tear down Al Jazeera's camera equipment after scaring them off and shooting at them.

204
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:14,849
Speaker 1: They didn't realize that other people would video that.

205
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:18,190
Speaker 1: That was the only camera they saw and they just went and took it out.

206
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,109
Speaker 0: This is why police officers need the cameras on them.

207
00:13:21,471 --> 00:13:22,329
Speaker 1: That's the other thing.

208
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:36,030
Speaker 0: People going to videotape the police officers anyway, so you figure why not just be proactive about it and equip every police officer with mandatory surveillance thing.

209
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,364
Speaker 1: We've had this technology for a decade.

210
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,310
Speaker 1: It's just that police really resist this.

211
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,110
Speaker 0: Because they don't want to get caught doing something jerky because often they act jerky.

212
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,090
Speaker 0: But it could protect them as well.

213
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,089
Speaker 0: So if somebody assaults a police officer, then you have evidence.

214
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:52,549
Speaker 1: Well, that's the final trouble.

215
00:13:53,070 --> 00:14:08,570
Speaker 1: Part of the reason why this situation keeps getting violent is even if the police don't do what they've been doing, it's possible that a lot of people will continue to instigate anyway because it's really easy to destabilize and really hard to build something new.

216
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:17,330
Speaker 1: There's almost no way for this situation to not have pretty much terrible optics because in the end, there's no way to know what happened.

217
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,129
Speaker 1: There's no video.

218
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:23,389
Speaker 1: There's eyewitness testimony, which is extremely unreliable, as we've talked about before on Geek Nights.

219
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:32,890
Speaker 1: It's basically a cop's word against a dead kid's word and people in the neighborhood who saw part of, but maybe not all of, the supposed confrontation.

220
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:38,850
Speaker 1: There's probably not going to be any closure or resolution to this at all.

221
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:44,961
Speaker 1: There's nothing we can do that will end it or say, "Oh, the cop was charged with murder and found

222
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:45,409
Speaker 1: guilty.".

223
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:47,909
Speaker 1: If the cop's charged with anything, he'll probably get off of it.

224
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,249
Speaker 1: The best case you can look for is maybe the cop will be found guilty of something and just fired.

225
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:56,630
Speaker 1: There's also the situation where anonymous announced the name of the cop.

226
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:58,189
Speaker 0: I wish they would stop doing that.

227
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:00,709
Speaker 1: Well, we don't know if that was the name of the cop or not.

228
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,730
Speaker 1: The police won't respond.

229
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,729
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

230
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,989
Speaker 0: They've done it before.

231
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:15,110
Speaker 0: Remember when people were trying to dox the Boston bombers and then a ton of people, like a mob, showed up at this poor kid's door who had absolutely nothing to do with the situation?

232
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:19,170
Speaker 1: It was like- Of course, in this case, what if they got the right guy?

233
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,609
Speaker 1: What if they got the right guy?

234
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:28,669
Speaker 0: Still, I feel like even if he's a shitty person, even if he shot the kid in cold blood or something like that, he's terrible, right?

235
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:36,934
Speaker 0: But I feel like ideally he should be tried in a court of law and nobody should have this sort of vigilante justice.

236
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:41,082
Speaker 0: try to get him before he gets out of town or something like that.

237
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:50,710
Speaker 1: Anyone who wants to do anything and that kind of information really can't be hidden.

238
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, people are going to want to try to- The cop's name is going to come out at some point.

239
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,865
Speaker 0: So we're going to have to deal with the fact that, yeah, you know, I've thought about this a lot.

240
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:03,350
Speaker 0: I'm always worried that I'm going to piss off the internet somehow.

241
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:05,330
Speaker 1: I kind of want to, but I'm a different kind of person.

242
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:10,286
Speaker 0: You're a lot less anxious than I am, but I live in fear of being the next.

243
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:14,050
Speaker 1: Anita Sarkeesian What if Scott and I said so many times, bring on the hate.

244
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:17,410
Speaker 1: We haven't gotten any quality hate mail or death threats in a long time.

245
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:19,649
Speaker 0: But have you ever gotten death threats?

246
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:25,450
Speaker 1: You could construe some things that people have said to me as death threats.

247
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:27,530
Speaker 0: Oh, that's kind of worrying.

248
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:36,830
Speaker 1: But that was back 2006, 2007 when podcasts were bigger and it was mostly when we'd do things that got high profile on sites other than our own.

249
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:45,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm always really scared that, oh, well, I'm very public with my persona and so I kind of like throw myself out there.

250
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:55,590
Speaker 0: People know my real name, my real address, so it's weird to think that back in the day it used to be like, you know, we were supposed to hide behind pseudonyms on the internet.

251
00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:02,180
Speaker 0: Maybe it was partly because I was a teenager, but I remember back in the nineties and stuff like nobody told their real name online.

252
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,589
Speaker 0: and now it's basically with social media.

253
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:10,566
Speaker 0: Everybody is, they, they brand themselves as a persona because people want credit for all the stuff they do.

254
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,208
Speaker 0: Exactly.

255
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,190
Speaker 0: And they share their real day to day life.

256
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:13,710
Speaker 0: That's true.

257
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,710
Speaker 1: Back in the old days, I was origins on the internet.

258
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,270
Speaker 1: That was my one of my earliest first handles.

259
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,069
Speaker 0: So it's, it's interesting.

260
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:29,268
Speaker 0: I feel like the net used to be a lot more anonymous before we were like, oh, this is who I am and look at all my stuff.

261
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:33,070
Speaker 0: So it's, it's good in some ways, bad in some ways.

262
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:40,049
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, I'm always scared that there's going to be someone outside my door just being like, I am going to stab her for the thing she said about video games.

263
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,528
Speaker 1: Luckily, the kinds of people who say those things in the context of video games, probably too fat to catch you.

264
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,708
Speaker 0: I run very fast.

265
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,230
Speaker 1: So it's Thursday.

266
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,037
Speaker 1: Scott hates that.

267
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:52,170
Speaker 1: I call Thursday the lounge.

268
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,769
Speaker 0: We will lounge.

269
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,768
Speaker 0: So it's the lounge.

270
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,290
Speaker 1: What are we going to talk about in the lounge?

271
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,230
Speaker 1: What is your topic?

272
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,590
Speaker 0: My topic or news or whatever it might be.

273
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,569
Speaker 0: My thing of the day.

274
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,042
Speaker 0: No news.

275
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:02,909
Speaker 0: No my news.

276
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:10,188
Speaker 0: I thought we were, I thought we had talked about the news that like, uh, you know, I don't know.

277
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:11,570
Speaker 1: Um, you don't have to.

278
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,566
Speaker 1: We can just go right on.

279
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,245
Speaker 1: I hear that bumper coming in.

280
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:27,490
Speaker 1: So anyway, things of the day, I do find it amusing that the, the tune you just hummed was the original geek nights.

281
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:29,428
Speaker 1: You know what that came from?

282
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,688
Speaker 0: Probably a family guy.

283
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,009
Speaker 1: It was a family guy thing.

284
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,830
Speaker 0: Usually when there's an inside joke that I think, yeah, it's weird.

285
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,750
Speaker 0: It's like usually when there's a thing that I think, stop it.

286
00:18:43,377 --> 00:18:44,710
Speaker 1: That was the original geek nights theme.

287
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,810
Speaker 1: If you listeners don't remember that, you've never listened to the beginning of geek nights.

288
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,100
Speaker 0: Yup.

289
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,457
Speaker 0: The, the first lost episodes,

290
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,846
Speaker 1: the first like three months of the show

291
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,256
Speaker 0: basically before you got the OC remixes all up in,

292
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:58,860
Speaker 1: but it

293
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:06,320
Speaker 0: was one of those things where it's like, um, you guys make all these inside jokes and I think they're just like weird things that you made up.

294
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,950
Speaker 0: And then you're like, Oh, it's from family guy.

295
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,398
Speaker 0: I'm like, shit.

296
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,950
Speaker 1: It's not always family guy.

297
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,070
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's Tommy boy.

298
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:18,350
Speaker 1: I hate both of those things, but you got to admit whenever I show you one of the clips that we got something from, they're always funny.

299
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:23,690
Speaker 0: It's like 50 50 some, sometimes I'm just like, ah, it makes me mad.

300
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:27,590
Speaker 1: It's the one in the forum today about how pizza restaurants can't make salad.

301
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,249
Speaker 0: That was true though.

302
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:29,537
Speaker 1: Yeah.

303
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,210
Speaker 0: And see, you know, making fun of a pizza restaurant, see, that's the thing.

304
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,650
Speaker 0: It's like family guy punches down.

305
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:38,409
Speaker 0: That's what I don't like about it.

306
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:42,270
Speaker 1: It's usually punches across and poop and vomit.

307
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,370
Speaker 1: Well, I feel like a lot of vomit.

308
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:54,147
Speaker 0: His whole thing is that like, Oh, I'm going to be edgy and have offensive humor, so I'm going to make fun of this disabled person or I'm going to make fun of this race or something like that.

309
00:19:54,531 --> 00:20:10,109
Speaker 0: And the, the assumption is that because he makes fun of everybody equally, then you know, you can't blame him, but I'm like, yeah, it still makes me kind of annoyed when there's that kind of a crude, slightly, versus main character and anti-hero is a like middle-class white dude.

310
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:12,730
Speaker 0: Well, I don't like the characters either.

311
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,109
Speaker 0: Of course.

312
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,049
Speaker 0: I like Brian.

313
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,681
Speaker 1: He's actually kind of a dick bag bag,

314
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:21,415
Speaker 0: but like the, the episode when he and Stewie go on the road trip, they still do

315
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:22,137
Speaker 1: those episodes,

316
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,642
Speaker 0: but yeah, I mean like it has its moments, but overall it's not a show I really seek out, but

317
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:37,629
Speaker 1: anyway, things of the day, I have it for you, some trading cards from 1902 and these trading cards are the women of the future.

318
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,104
Speaker 1: Oh dude.

319
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:50,686
Speaker 1: Well, the sexy women of the future, they're pinups and they're like, it's women dressed as sort of stereotypes of male roles and it's like.

320
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:52,190
Speaker 1: this is what women will be in the future.

321
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:58,819
Speaker 0: There'll be judges and reporters and things, but, but sexy, it's like Halloween or something back in the 1920s.

322
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,870
Speaker 1: I got to say, I want these styles in these pinups to become real styles that people wear.

323
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:05,790
Speaker 0: We could.

324
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:06,908
Speaker 1: Look at that duck head.

325
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:07,750
Speaker 1: That duck head is great.

326
00:21:07,771 --> 00:21:08,550
Speaker 1: You know what would be cool?

327
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,958
Speaker 0: You know how Halloween, we always lampoon Halloween for being like, oh yeah, it's so lame.

328
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,090
Speaker 0: Adults just have sexy versions of every costume.

329
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,129
Speaker 1: Should we all dress up as this?

330
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:17,464
Speaker 0: Yes.

331
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:26,310
Speaker 0: We should do the sexy versions of like a judge and stuff like that, but the 1910 style of You know when you said sexy versions of judge, all I can think of is the anime judge.

332
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,588
Speaker 0: Or Judge Doom or something.

333
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,929
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen Judge?

334
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:32,487
Speaker 0: No, I didn't.

335
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:34,043
Speaker 1: I did not.

336
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:44,330
Speaker 1: Judge is one of those shows that was sitting in a blockbuster right next to Doom, Megalopolis and Armageddon from the director of Burn Up W.

337
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:45,769
Speaker 0: That looks pretty cool.

338
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:46,950
Speaker 0: I'm looking over my shoulder.

339
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:48,870
Speaker 0: Those are, those are some good pinups.

340
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:49,508
Speaker 0: I like that.

341
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:56,490
Speaker 0: I always like, you know, it's kind of one of those retro futurism things, but I always like what the past thought the future would be.

342
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:11,650
Speaker 0: There was, there was like those French postcards that I saw a few months ago where it was like, you know, a bunch of women sitting around talking on their video phones and basically they had like, you know, a very, very retro looking version.

343
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,910
Speaker 0: Like imagine an iPhone crossed with a gramophone and you have what this postcard was portraying.

344
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,250
Speaker 0: and it was like communication in the future.

345
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,790
Speaker 0: And I was like, oddly prescient.

346
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,869
Speaker 1: I think the cutest girl is the soldier girl with the belle de loge months.

347
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:26,909
Speaker 0: See, are these French too?

348
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:28,989
Speaker 0: French futurism?

349
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,190
Speaker 1: Well, they're all French French postcards.

350
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,245
Speaker 1: It's the women of the future from France.

351
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:36,860
Speaker 0: Oh, it has a Napoleon looking hat.

352
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:40,270
Speaker 1: So you have a thing of the day.

353
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:40,965
Speaker 0: I do indeed.

354
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,130
Speaker 0: Um, my thing of the day is an article on cartoon brew, uh, women.

355
00:22:45,471 --> 00:22:51,270
Speaker 0: I are actually, we got tickets to an advanced screening of the box trolls next Tuesday.

356
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:57,450
Speaker 0: And so that's one of the perks of dating an animator is we can get you into all these free pre screenings and stuff like that.

357
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:10,489
Speaker 0: And they're, it's, I'm actually looking forward to it cause there's going to be a director Q and A. So, um, anyway, this article is how like a use 3d printing to do all the facial expressions in the box trolls.

358
00:23:11,212 --> 00:23:16,790
Speaker 0: And in case you didn't know, um, you know, Coraline and, uh, paranormal and stuff.

359
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:19,390
Speaker 0: They are the studio behind those features.

360
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:31,589
Speaker 0: And uh, one of the things that they're notable for is being some of the pioneers of stop motion in an era where most, uh, animated features are 3d, you know, that are done all digitally.

361
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:52,147
Speaker 0: And uh, the cool thing about one of Leica's processes is instead of like sculpting each head, um, from scratch individually, they actually model it in 3d inside the computer and then use rapid prototyping to make all these different facial expressions for the, for the puppets.

362
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,890
Speaker 0: And uh, so anyway, I'm looking forward to the film.

363
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:01,549
Speaker 0: They're uh, their work is always great and this is actually kind of a cool, uh, cool look into their process.

364
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:04,009
Speaker 0: So I hope you enjoy it.

365
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:04,401
Speaker 0: All right.

366
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,850
Speaker 1: In the meantime, the book club book is still a canticle for Liebowitz.

367
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:09,790
Speaker 1: I suspect Scott won't read it until it's winter.

368
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,128
Speaker 1: We're going to be at PAX prime and Dev.

369
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,578
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

370
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,009
Speaker 0: Rem and I are going to Dev.

371
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,530
Speaker 1: So come say hi to us at Dev.

372
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:20,928
Speaker 1: Uh, I'll be there representing date night-o and HTMLV and visual novels rather than geek nights.

373
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you, you finally are in the game industry.

374
00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:28,369
Speaker 1: I'm a legitimate gamesman at this point.

375
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:34,750
Speaker 1: Uh, we're also going to be at PAX prime doing on Monday in the sandworm theater at noon, how to win every game.

376
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:41,590
Speaker 1: This might be our most deeply thought out and well put together panel, or I guess lecture ever.

377
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,830
Speaker 0: You're actually getting it done way ahead of time.

378
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,307
Speaker 0: It's been done for a long time.

379
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,769
Speaker 1: We practiced it at kinetic con pretty pumped about it.

380
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:55,370
Speaker 1: Might also run it without Scott at Australia because I not Emily and not Scott, I'm going to PAX OSS in October.

381
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,474
Speaker 0: I wish I could go.

382
00:24:56,535 --> 00:24:59,364
Speaker 0: like when you guys went to Australia, I was like, Oh, I wish I could go.

383
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:00,730
Speaker 0: I have no vacation.

384
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:01,430
Speaker 0: Goodbye.

385
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,019
Speaker 0: Yeah.

386
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:02,950
Speaker 1: Well.

387
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:07,710
Speaker 1: It's mostly I work in an industry where I can pretty much just take any vacation time I want.

388
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,870
Speaker 0: Well, this was cool cause it's like, it was like half work, half play.

389
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,630
Speaker 1: I'm going to a far more boring convention in Sydney, uh, about a week before packs off.

390
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:22,049
Speaker 1: So I'm doing, I'm going to two conventions, one of which is fun and one of which is the fixed protocol.

391
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,550
Speaker 0: You lucky guy, all your business travel going to Paris at this point.

392
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:31,230
Speaker 1: I'm kind of one of the, uh, jet experts in the world on the fixed protocol.

393
00:25:32,015 --> 00:25:32,508
Speaker 0: Jet setter.

394
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,610
Speaker 1: I should have a lecture on that.

395
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:41,406
Speaker 1: Actually you should do a, on the fixed protocol or on the fixed protocol, I should be like, so you want to work in the financials.

396
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:51,190
Speaker 0: They give you lots of fancy wine and they pay you really well and, or you could make video games and work way over time.

397
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,820
Speaker 1: A third of the money and send a hundred and 60 hours.

398
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:59,470
Speaker 0: passion, Gerald passion, wait, is that the geeky guy kind of passion?

399
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:00,330
Speaker 1: That's passion.

400
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:00,766
Speaker 0: Oh no.

401
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:05,470
Speaker 1: So I've been watching the daily show pretty much since it started.

402
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:14,090
Speaker 1: Like I literally, when the first episode was announced, like I knew the show was coming because I was a fan of like Liz Winstead and I knew she was like doing this thing.

403
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:15,225
Speaker 1: So I figured I'd follow it.

404
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:22,830
Speaker 1: Uh, kind of knew who Craig Kilborn was because I watched a lot of like weird talk shows and things and I'd seen him on a sports center or whatever.

405
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:25,650
Speaker 1: So I was excited and I watched the daily show and it was awesome.

406
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,189
Speaker 0: So what year did it start about?

407
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,510
Speaker 1: Like 1996?

408
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a long time ago.

409
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,930
Speaker 1: About five or 96.

410
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,951
Speaker 1: I can't exactly remember when, uh, it was started in 96.

411
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:38,103
Speaker 1: I think it was announced in 1995 that it was coming.

412
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,036
Speaker 0: So you must've been like middle school or something, high school, high school, 96 was high school.

413
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:44,850
Speaker 1: as a freshman in high school.

414
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:51,326
Speaker 1: And I remember like three years later when Craig Kilborn left, you were like, oh, it's done.

415
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,290
Speaker 1: I had never heard of John Stewart.

416
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,410
Speaker 1: I didn't, I looked him up and was not particularly impressed.

417
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:01,590
Speaker 1: And Craig Kilborn was the funniest guy I'd ever seen on a talk show.

418
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,650
Speaker 1: So I couldn't imagine, like I figured the show was just going to be awful.

419
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,769
Speaker 1: And then I heard that like he took five questions with him.

420
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:11,705
Speaker 1: So I wouldn't like, they get it, they were going to change the show, change the format around.

421
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,526
Speaker 1: And I remember I watched the first episode of John Stewart and suddenly Craig Kilborn was dead to me.

422
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:18,170
Speaker 1: It was a hack.

423
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:19,029
Speaker 1: He was never funny.

424
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:21,349
Speaker 1: And as far as I can tell, he hasn't done much.

425
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:29,029
Speaker 0: Thing is John Stewart, see, I only started watching the show maybe around 2005 or so because I started watching it.

426
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,587
Speaker 0: I'd never had a TV growing up.

427
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:35,410
Speaker 0: And then I roomed with a girl who is really into television.

428
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,450
Speaker 0: I mean, that's what she was going into is, you know, film and television.

429
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,730
Speaker 1: I watched a decade more of the Daily Show than you.

430
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,407
Speaker 0: I know, that's crazy.

431
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:50,770
Speaker 0: But it's like I started watching the show when John Stewart was already like firmly entrenched as like the longtime host of the Daily Show.

432
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:58,109
Speaker 0: But even then, it's weird to see like clips from when I started watching the show after Colbert had left.

433
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,670
Speaker 0: No, no.

434
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,350
Speaker 0: I remember him as a correspondent.

435
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the Colbert Report started in like 2005 or 2006.

436
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:05,930
Speaker 0: No, it didn't.

437
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:06,658
Speaker 0: It started...

438
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,388
Speaker 1: I just looked it up.

439
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,210
Speaker 0: But I do remember when it started.

440
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:16,287
Speaker 0: I remember when they were like, because Macy and I were like, oh, they're going to have an extra show.

441
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:21,230
Speaker 0: And so, but I started watching it like maybe the year before then, perhaps.

442
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:22,370
Speaker 0: I can't remember.

443
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,410
Speaker 0: Anyway, it was great.

444
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:28,170
Speaker 0: And I actually remember that that was kind of a tradition with us.

445
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:34,228
Speaker 0: It's like we'd kind of take a break from studying around 11 o'clock and watch the Daily Show every night.

446
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:35,547
Speaker 1: Yep.

447
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,449
Speaker 1: And that's still what we do.

448
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:41,536
Speaker 1: Like that's the one thing that... Because I can't watch a good anime while we're eating, because I got to pay attention to it.

449
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:41,910
Speaker 1: Yeah.

450
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,310
Speaker 1: And I can't watch anime while I'm just fucking around like mopping or anything.

451
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,270
Speaker 1: I think anything that... Because I can't understand Japanese.

452
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:47,642
Speaker 1: Yeah.

453
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:49,590
Speaker 1: The thing is... And the dubs are terrible.

454
00:28:49,851 --> 00:28:53,709
Speaker 0: Even without... Because I don't really need subtitles as much as Rim does.

455
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:56,920
Speaker 0: But it's like I really want to pay attention.

456
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:10,988
Speaker 0: if something's visually engaging, but like a talk show or a news program or something like that, it's like you don't have to have your eyes on the screen every second in order to really get the full enjoyment and experience out of it.

457
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,450
Speaker 0: I mean, you're more the type who will do stuff while the television's on.

458
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:21,721
Speaker 0: I have trouble multitasking when there's a TV, like when TV is happening in a space that I'm in.

459
00:29:22,972 --> 00:29:25,530
Speaker 0: So... But yeah, it's a daily show.

460
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:33,850
Speaker 0: It's like I can eat and watch the daily show, but I have a hard time eating and watching a really intense film or something like that.

461
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:40,330
Speaker 1: But as much as I like the daily show, it's still just more funny than it is deeply informative.

462
00:29:41,731 --> 00:29:52,949
Speaker 0: Sometimes, though, he will go on a crusade and he will pick out certain issues that he really wants to highlight, like the whole thing about the first responders, cancer and stuff like that.

463
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,510
Speaker 0: Jon Stewart is actually pretty civic-minded.

464
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:17,670
Speaker 1: I guess as a result, what I both like about the show and what bothers me about the show is that because it's so easy to point out just like individual hypocrisy and just this ridiculous bullshit, the fact that there really aren't that many people doing it and that a comedy show is honestly a better look at the news than most real television news.

465
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:32,230
Speaker 0: I actually feel kind of guilty saying this, but there have been things, especially when I get really busy and then I take a break to watch the daily show, there will be some times when I'll find out about recent news from the daily show.

466
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:37,270
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, look, a lot of adults I know had no idea anything had happened in Ferguson, It's weird.

467
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:38,649
Speaker 0: I can't imagine that.

468
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,244
Speaker 0: It's like...

469
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,068
Speaker 1: They had no idea that anything had gone on.

470
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:42,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I get a lot of stuff.

471
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,650
Speaker 0: People mention stuff on Twitter.

472
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:53,510
Speaker 0: I'll go to Google News, but when I'm really busy, I won't be constantly seeking out news on the internet.

473
00:30:53,671 --> 00:30:58,930
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I spend a good 45 minutes of every morning reading the news, drinking coffee.

474
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

475
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:00,770
Speaker 0: It's been my thing.

476
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,325
Speaker 0: I go into work and it's like, "Oh, time to

477
00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:03,526
Speaker 0: work."

478
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:04,349
Speaker 0: You know?

479
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:16,968
Speaker 0: So anyway, but that aside, one thing that I think is big in the format of the daily show is, like you said, he focuses, especially now, a lot more on the media's portrayal of the news.

480
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,190
Speaker 0: That's a big thing.

481
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,350
Speaker 0: It's like a show that looks at other shows.

482
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:34,569
Speaker 0: He does a lot of stuff with Fox, like Bullshit Mountain, and he'll contrast clips of politicians or news anchors speaking in direct opposition to something that they'd said 12 months earlier during a primary.

483
00:31:35,631 --> 00:31:38,785
Speaker 0: And so I think that's a big shtick that the daily show has.

484
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:47,670
Speaker 0: that kind of sets it apart from, like Colbert shtick is, he's parodying the right wing anchors at Fox.

485
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:52,830
Speaker 0: He's like the conservative, but really overblown and fear mongering kind of thing.

486
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:56,890
Speaker 0: So Jon Stewart is like media criticism.

487
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,210
Speaker 1: I never found the Colbert report funny.

488
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,830
Speaker 1: The concept was funny.

489
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,824
Speaker 1: I watched it once, I was like, "That's a really good take on that,".

490
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:05,810
Speaker 1: and then I had no interest never watching it again.

491
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:13,270
Speaker 0: I like Colbert okay, but I like, Stewart has a little bit more, because he's not as much playing a character.

492
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:20,910
Speaker 0: I mean, he still is, and he still kind of broadened his humor sometimes, but it's like, it feels more sincere.

493
00:32:21,332 --> 00:32:22,986
Speaker 0: It's like a more direct take on it.

494
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:29,510
Speaker 0: So I don't know, Colbert, I have a lot of friends who love Colbert, but he's like kind Yeah, and I'm talking directly at you friends.

495
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:31,089
Speaker 1: I don't think Colbert's that funny.

496
00:32:32,431 --> 00:32:33,708
Speaker 0: But what's he going to do?

497
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,969
Speaker 0: He's going to be a regular talk show host now.

498
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, I suspect they're going to ruin that.

499
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:41,989
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know.

500
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:48,450
Speaker 1: I mean, the only reason Jon Oliver gets away with what he gets away with, because HBO has given him a whole ton of rope.

501
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,470
Speaker 0: So let's talk about that.

502
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,090
Speaker 0: It's basically HBO's version of The Daily Show.

503
00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:05,150
Speaker 1: I like the fact that this kind of news satire is becoming a genre, and that it's so popular among young people, or at least internet-y young people.

504
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:06,088
Speaker 0: That's it.

505
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:06,511
Speaker 0: It's like.

506
00:33:06,712 --> 00:33:10,468
Speaker 0: HBO probably looked at the popularity of The Daily Show and said, "We need

507
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:10,649
Speaker 0: that.".

508
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,846
Speaker 0: And so they got Jon Oliver, who was a former Daily Show correspondent, and gave him his own show.

509
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:22,730
Speaker 0: And so in a way it was kind of like Colbert in that it was almost a spinoff, but it's owned by a completely different channel.

510
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:25,050
Speaker 1: But without having commercials, one.

511
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:25,909
Speaker 1: No commercials.

512
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,089
Speaker 1: And you can say fuck.

513
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:31,129
Speaker 0: And show penises, which happened in a number of instances.

514
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:38,468
Speaker 1: I'm going to admit that I like Jon Oliver's show already more than I like The Daily Show, ever.

515
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,410
Speaker 0: So I think there's a slightly different kind of humor.

516
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,150
Speaker 1: I don't think it's news satire.

517
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:52,730
Speaker 1: It's just news, and it's funny in the way that someone explaining to you that you've got cancer could be funny in the way they did it.

518
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:59,270
Speaker 0: No, it's definitely still comedy, but it's not parodying anything as much.

519
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:07,450
Speaker 0: He's still being very comedic, and his humor tends to be a little bit more pointed and a little bit darker.

520
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,270
Speaker 1: Am I not a fan of dark and pointed humor?

521
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,050
Speaker 0: It's like people say because he's British.

522
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,447
Speaker 1: Night arrows are perhaps the funniest thing in the world to me.

523
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,318
Speaker 0: But that's kind of ...

524
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:17,188
Speaker 1: Night arrows, because it's dark and pointed.

525
00:34:18,695 --> 00:34:18,779
Speaker 0: Lols.

526
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,203
Speaker 0: But no, people are saying, "Oh, it's British humor,".

527
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:30,589
Speaker 0: but I think it's just more that he tends to be a little bit more like you laugh at something, but you're kind of like, "Ow.

528
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,194
Speaker 0: Ooh.

529
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:32,001
Speaker 0: Ow.".

530
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,568
Speaker 0: Too real.

531
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,016
Speaker 0: Too real.

532
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,849
Speaker 1: Too soon and too real.

533
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:46,370
Speaker 1: It's like he's listening to Geek Nights for our entire run, and one by one, he is focusing on everything I've ever been pissed off about.

534
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:58,489
Speaker 0: That's the thing that amazed me about that show is how consistently it's addressed the things that have concerned you and I. The things that we're mad about, and like I was saying, we come home and gripe about things we can't change.

535
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:02,008
Speaker 1: You guys don't understand how mad I am about the prison industrial complex.

536
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,230
Speaker 0: It's like we'll get on these topics and just be like, "Ah, prisons," or, "Ah, fake medicine.

537
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:08,257
Speaker 0: Why isn't it

538
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:08,883
Speaker 0: regulated?".

539
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:11,310
Speaker 0: Weird random stuff.

540
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,350
Speaker 0: Technology issues, like net neutrality.

541
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:19,050
Speaker 0: These are the things that we're kind of activists about, that we care about and talk about.

542
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:26,850
Speaker 0: They're not addressed as much in a lot of the political discourse, I guess.

543
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:45,270
Speaker 0: The fact that every week with his show, he's picked something, he's picked a topic that's actually we care a lot about and just completely done this hilarious and chilling at the same time expose into that topic.

544
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:46,206
Speaker 0: Let's see.

545
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,210
Speaker 0: What are some of the examples?

546
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:48,190
Speaker 1: Net neutrality.

547
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:49,630
Speaker 1: Global warming.

548
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,030
Speaker 1: Fake medicine.

549
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,410
Speaker 1: Immigration reform.

550
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, he did that.

551
00:35:55,090 --> 00:36:01,833
Speaker 0: I think one of my favorite episodes was the one about gay rights where he talked to that activist.

552
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:05,244
Speaker 0: in which country was it?

553
00:36:07,091 --> 00:36:08,408
Speaker 1: That was in Uganda.

554
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,930
Speaker 0: That passed the really nasty anti-gay bill.

555
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,429
Speaker 1: Not the nastiest in that region though, to be fair.

556
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:30,710
Speaker 0: But it was far more draconian than it ever had been and so if somebody just acknowledged that they were gay, they faced huge jail terms and incredible abuse.

557
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:34,430
Speaker 0: It was wonderful.

558
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:41,489
Speaker 0: He had this activist on the program and he talked about this fight that was going on.

559
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:44,970
Speaker 0: He doesn't do interviews every time.

560
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:55,370
Speaker 0: That's another major difference from The Daily Show is that he'll get people on if they're relevant to the issue, but he doesn't always and he definitely takes advantage of the bigger budget.

561
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,990
Speaker 1: Well, they're definitely trying to make an impression with this first season.

562
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,630
Speaker 1: I have a feeling the budget will scale back in future seasons.

563
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:08,690
Speaker 0: They'll do these incredibly elaborate throwaway gags.

564
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:21,808
Speaker 1: Also, though, by not being tied to this very tight, specific format that The Daily Show has followed for pretty much the entirety of its run, sometimes he'll talk for a long time about one thing.

565
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,850
Speaker 1: Sometimes he'll do a funny bit between two things.

566
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,205
Speaker 1: Sometimes they just won't.

567
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,990
Speaker 0: Well, because there's no commercials.

568
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:38,086
Speaker 0: They do those mini ... They're basically like montages, like politicians saying something incredibly racist or something like that.

569
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:44,534
Speaker 1: Geek Nights has talked to the same format without altering it ever since 2005.

570
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:45,250
Speaker 0: That's not true.

571
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,389
Speaker 0: When I'm on, we alter it a little bit.

572
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,885
Speaker 1: We have followed the Geek Nights format to the T.

573
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:51,929
Speaker 0: We have.

574
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,288
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't have a news.

575
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,930
Speaker 1: Our format, if you want to talk jargon styles, we have an opening bit, like an opening stinger.

576
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:02,470
Speaker 1: that's meta, but isn't meta to the show, it's meta to our lives, usually an anecdote or something.

577
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:08,089
Speaker 1: It's like the second half of a conversation because that's the kind of thing that's popular on those morning talk show type of things.

578
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:17,850
Speaker 1: Then we do the news segment, then we have the bumper, then we do two things of the day, a brief meta moment, which was added in 2009.

579
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:23,109
Speaker 1: Then we do the main bit, and then occasionally there'll be a stinger at the end after the closing theme.

580
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,477
Speaker 1: Really haven't deviated from that.

581
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,269
Speaker 1: unless we do an interview show, which is we just interview someone for an hour.

582
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:39,930
Speaker 0: Well, when you have someone like Conrad on, you still follow the format, but you have a little bit more of a freeform conversation during the main bit of the show.

583
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:47,390
Speaker 1: Well, when we got guests on the show, when we had guest hosts as opposed to just guests on the show, we actually made them follow our format exactly.

584
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,950
Speaker 1: Fast Karate for the Geek Nights, I remember- That was good.

585
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:55,261
Speaker 1: Well, because I remember they were like, "Oh, so I guess we got to talk about our day for the first

586
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:55,508
Speaker 1: bit.".

587
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:59,270
Speaker 0: We got to talk about biking, but I guess that was in the pre-biking era.

588
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:04,030
Speaker 1: They were obviously reading the cue sheet I gave them while they were doing the show.

589
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,649
Speaker 0: Yeah.

590
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:12,710
Speaker 0: Man, if we had done standard Geek Nights, it would have been me talking about the bike crackdown and being like, "Oh, and so biking today-".

591
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,690
Speaker 1: Oh, actually I avoided getting a ticket today by running away from the police.

592
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:23,490
Speaker 0: So I was biking up Franklin Avenue- Man, we should have done this during the meta... Not the meta moment.

593
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,146
Speaker 0: The open-y bit.

594
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,707
Speaker 0: The open-y bit.

595
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,450
Speaker 1: I was biking up Franklin Avenue.

596
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,069
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of slow fucking fixies around me.

597
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,150
Speaker 1: So lights red, no traffic because there's never any traffic there.

598
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,690
Speaker 0: And you ran the light like you do.

599
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,870
Speaker 1: So I ran the light in this cluster of slow fixies.

600
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:37,907
Speaker 1: Utah stop.

601
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,810
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't do the Utah stop because there was a light and I didn't even stop.

602
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:45,909
Speaker 1: The Utah stop is you roll... Stop signs, everything gets downgraded one.

603
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, like stop sign yield and red light is stop sign.

604
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,570
Speaker 1: But I just rolled through it with everybody else.

605
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,909
Speaker 1: Going slow because they're fixies.

606
00:39:53,671 --> 00:40:02,110
Speaker 1: And I see up ahead, just because I'm aware, a police van that is obviously poised for intervention and I knew it was bike week.

607
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:08,228
Speaker 1: So what I did is I blew through the red light and immediately popped onto the curb and got off my bike right there.

608
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,229
Speaker 1: Like right on the curb.

609
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,490
Speaker 1: And I leaned my bike against the wall like I was going to tie it up and do a thing.

610
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:15,009
Speaker 1: That's where my destination was.

611
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:25,450
Speaker 1: And then I see the van, the cop van kind of pull out, get in front of the bikers and then like slow down and get them all to stop and then cops jump out to write them tickets.

612
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,128
Speaker 1: And then I see one of the cops looking over at me.

613
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,228
Speaker 1: Like looking directly at me.

614
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:34,770
Speaker 1: And they know that I ran the light and stopped right there.

615
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,210
Speaker 1: And I see them like writing the things and they're looking at me like they're waiting.

616
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,889
Speaker 0: They're thinking should we go after him.

617
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:46,530
Speaker 1: So I stand there looking at my phone and I see like the cops stay out and they're processing all these fucking fixies.

618
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:51,450
Speaker 1: And then the van like drives up a little bit and then turns right.

619
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:57,049
Speaker 1: And I know it's turned right down the road that I would have to take if I wanted to go to the bridge because there's nowhere else to bike over there.

620
00:40:57,871 --> 00:41:09,250
Speaker 1: So I get on my bike and I take a different route and I go up a block and I go over and I kind of look and I see in the distance it is parked right where I would have gone.

621
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,369
Speaker 1: Like it's waiting for me.

622
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,730
Speaker 0: It's a good thing it wasn't like at the actual entrance to the Williamsburg.

623
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,550
Speaker 1: Yeah it was on the other side.

624
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,310
Speaker 1: It was by the Pulaski.

625
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:16,789
Speaker 0: Tomorrow.

626
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:22,490
Speaker 1: Well if they recognize me tomorrow and they listen to Geek Nights this is just parody.

627
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:23,690
Speaker 1: This is new satire.

628
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:24,748
Speaker 1: None of that happened.

629
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,550
Speaker 0: We're picking stuff up because we had to have a bike related anecdote.

630
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,930
Speaker 1: Just like I've never smoked marijuana and I'm not drinking beer right now.

631
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,970
Speaker 1: Well I guess beer is not illegal.

632
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:32,990
Speaker 0: Beer is not illegal.

633
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,090
Speaker 0: What is this prohibition?

634
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:36,029
Speaker 1: I've ridden my bike home drunk though.

635
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:36,778
Speaker 0: Yeah.

636
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:37,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

637
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:38,706
Speaker 0: Only a few times.

638
00:41:41,052 --> 00:41:53,970
Speaker 1: The gist of all this is that I'm really excited that last week tonight is doing well because I think as a new way to manufacture outrage among the people who matter about things that matter.

639
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:57,310
Speaker 1: This is possibly the most efficient machine I've seen.

640
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:04,270
Speaker 0: Well the cool thing about it too is that he specifically on a lot of topics he'll do things to actively get people involved.

641
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,330
Speaker 0: Like he'll say oh this is why this sucks like with the net neutrality.

642
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,889
Speaker 0: Here is an address you can write to.

643
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:22,090
Speaker 0: And so he basically leverages media presence to like point his laser directly at like a certain politician who is really bad on technological issues.

644
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,930
Speaker 0: So I like that aspect of it.

645
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:25,329
Speaker 1: Well that's it.

646
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,630
Speaker 1: It's not just the daily show where you say look at this fucker.

647
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,509
Speaker 0: Respect his privacy.

648
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,827
Speaker 0: Respect his privacy.

649
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,926
Speaker 1: But this show every episode is not just a hey look at these fuckers.

650
00:42:35,006 --> 00:42:36,349
Speaker 1: it's also a call to action.

651
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,350
Speaker 0: He's like what can you do about this?

652
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,970
Speaker 0: I mean it's like all minor things.

653
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:45,730
Speaker 0: It's not like oh take to the streets kind of thing but he does give you something you.

654
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,788
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for the episode where he says now everyone reach under your seat you will find a gun.

655
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:56,110
Speaker 0: It's like some sort of Manchurian candidate like trigger where.

656
00:42:56,751 --> 00:43:10,330
Speaker 1: Well it's the same reason why if there's ever a disaster like the crowd thing where people just don't react to it and someone needs to take charge and say you do CPR you call 911 you go do this because if you don't do that people just stand there doing nothing.

657
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:11,510
Speaker 1: It's the same thing.

658
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:20,470
Speaker 0: You're good at that like whenever there's something goes down or like if people are being indecisive even you're kind of like okay now it's leadership time and you'll like step up and be like follow me.

659
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,430
Speaker 1: Though I'm a jerk because occasionally especially when it's something minor.

660
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,870
Speaker 0: Sometimes you'll be like I don't want to deal with it and just go off by yourself.

661
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:41,650
Speaker 1: But when it's something minor like a bunch of people are over and they're demeuring about what to eat for dinner sometimes if I'm not in if I have no horse in this race I'll just lean back and let it happen and watch the clusterfuck slowly approach and not do anything because it's hilarious and fuck everybody.

662
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:45,682
Speaker 0: Yeah but you know there are times when you'll be like follow me.

663
00:43:46,284 --> 00:43:46,746
Speaker 0: so I'm.

664
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:54,330
Speaker 0: I'm kind of lucky and that like you know if everything goes to shit and society collapses and we're all I'll start a cult and the cult will take care of us.

665
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:54,930
Speaker 0: Yeah you'll be the crazy.

666
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:59,869
Speaker 1: I'll form the city of Southern Cross and everything will be awesome in Southern Cross for us.

667
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,789
Speaker 0: Yeah so anyway.

668
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,390
Speaker 1: Well the problem with that is that I'm not nine feet tall.

669
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:13,910
Speaker 0: Yeah I was gonna say you're gonna have some guy and you'll be like I have all the power because people listen to me and then some nine foot guy with a purple mohawk is gonna come and pile drive you into the ground.

670
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:15,450
Speaker 0: That's what's gonna happen.

671
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,748
Speaker 1: There are a few bad guys in Fifth of the North Star who are relatively small and have larger people to work for them.

672
00:44:20,651 --> 00:44:21,310
Speaker 0: That whole show.

673
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,569
Speaker 0: Huron barter town.

674
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:28,070
Speaker 0: That kind of show seems to rely mostly on brawn and physical strength.

675
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,335
Speaker 0: You don't see the little guy.

676
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,568
Speaker 0: go up to Kenshiro and go hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.

677
00:44:33,411 --> 00:44:39,728
Speaker 0: he doesn't do the psychological manipulation like even the people who do are typically also nine feet tall.

678
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:43,329
Speaker 0: You are a shock.

679
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:46,869
Speaker 1: So I hope this show keeps up with what it's doing right now.

680
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:52,064
Speaker 1: I hope that more shows like this start appearing and I hope that it starts.

681
00:44:53,308 --> 00:44:58,870
Speaker 1: I think it's a good meme generator to spread memes that actually lead to some sort of action or voting.

682
00:44:59,851 --> 00:45:00,593
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

683
00:45:00,653 --> 00:45:09,379
Speaker 0: it's like I almost feel like there's a difference between like the old new left right kind of propaganda.

684
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:13,632
Speaker 0: in a way because like if this is our propaganda it's all like.

685
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:19,668
Speaker 0: it tends to do a lot of stuff with humor and it tends to like spread its memes through humor.

686
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,659
Speaker 1: Humor and it's also just truth.

687
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,230
Speaker 1: it's like we don't need to spin this here's video of this asshole saying something really racist.

688
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:36,682
Speaker 0: You have to understand that that's still documentary like people tend to treat documentaries like they're unbiased but selective editing it's.

689
00:45:37,063 --> 00:45:42,769
Speaker 0: it may be true it may be an event that occurred but it's still choosing which parts of that event to show you.

690
00:45:43,132 --> 00:45:45,610
Speaker 0: So like you can't pretend it's not unbiased.

691
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,009
Speaker 0: I mean it tends to be biased in a way that I agree with.

692
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:50,869
Speaker 0: So I'm like very much for it.

693
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:58,549
Speaker 0: But you know if that's our propaganda it it like spreads its means through humor whereas the old propaganda spreads its means through fear.

694
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:05,116
Speaker 0: You know all the memes of Fox News are like you're based means immigrants take a job kind of thing.

695
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:07,533
Speaker 0: Yeah.

696
00:46:07,594 --> 00:46:08,938
Speaker 0: so anyway I like it.

697
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:09,882
Speaker 0: I like it.

698
00:46:09,962 --> 00:46:12,030
Speaker 0: I'm going to keep watching it and see how it goes.

699
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,871
