1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,467
Speaker 0: It's Thursday October 11th.

2
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:12,289
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:15,417
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:19,499
Speaker 0: We talk about our fantastical dumpster diving adventure.

5
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:25,386
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,969
Speaker 0: rain today Rain tomorrow, right?

7
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,035
Speaker 0: You know rain is awesome.

8
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:39,460
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna dwell on this I'm not gonna do what I always do and talk about all the crazy traffic I saw or whatever.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:49,992
Speaker 0: But it still bothers me that every time there's even a small amount of rain in downstate, New York There's like a hundred car accidents immediately on every Parkway.

10
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:53,223
Speaker 1: because when the snow people do try to drive more carefully They don't.

11
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:55,260
Speaker 0: well even more accidents.

12
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:57,829
Speaker 1: Well, that's because people suck at it, but they do.

13
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,262
Speaker 1: you know these people who don't a lot of people without SUVs You know.

14
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:05,036
Speaker 1: they realize that there's snow and they drive a little slower right when there's rain.

15
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:06,140
Speaker 1: You will drive as normal.

16
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:08,366
Speaker 1: They don't even think that the you know.

17
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:18,500
Speaker 1: they don't understand just how slippery the road can be when it's just wet Especially like if you know oil's been building up on the road for many weeks, and then it rained suddenly and slippery shit.

18
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:30,843
Speaker 0: I do have to say that I mean usually it's just ah someone stupid caused an accident But I actually got a little bit of a close-up encounter with the people involved in the accident that held me up for an hour And a half this morning.

19
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:35,039
Speaker 0: Oh, and uh I laughed out loud and the cop looked at me.

20
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:37,840
Speaker 0: So basically there's this bridge.

21
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:49,380
Speaker 0: There's only two ways to get to New York City from here unless you take like the New York State Thruway Which I'm not unless you cross the Hudson and then cross the Hudson again Which would mean I have to take 287 which is a nice road in Jersey.

22
00:01:49,501 --> 00:02:06,607
Speaker 0: But if any of you are ever in the state of New York And you see a road that is called Interstate 287 and it is very useful road But it is a Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday or Friday Ah Don't go anywhere near it.

23
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,631
Speaker 0: I'm tapping.

24
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,555
Speaker 1: all hope happens.

25
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:12,725
Speaker 1: He bridges included on that road You enter here.

26
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,995
Speaker 0: that is the worst road in the world.

27
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:17,789
Speaker 1: It's very useful though It goes like straight across.

28
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,840
Speaker 0: you need to go you need to get somewhere.

29
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,074
Speaker 0: That's the road except that it's not actually a road.

30
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:22,940
Speaker 0: It's a parking lot.

31
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:28,140
Speaker 0: It's a 20 mile long parking lot that goes across the Hudson River and the Tappan Zee bridge is real long.

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,339
Speaker 0: So if you have to pee and you get stuck on that bridge I have sat on the Tappan Zee bridge for more than an hour.

33
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:40,989
Speaker 1: They actually have installed a thing on the Tappan Zee bridge years and years ago where if they can drive this truck down the middle Of the bridge and it moves that barrier

34
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,141
Speaker 0: so scary if you see it moving Yeah,

35
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:49,120
Speaker 1: it basically moves these giant concrete slabs to the right or to the left to add lanes to the inbound or outbound.

36
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:52,720
Speaker 1: You know You can subtract a lane from the inbound and add a lane to the outbound or vice versa.

37
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:55,760
Speaker 0: It throws those concrete blocks and they're pretty big.

38
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:05,860
Speaker 1: it's just a thing that goes forward really slowly and it picks up blocks and moves them back and forth and Eventually, you know, it moves block block block block eventually moves the entire lane barrier.

39
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:08,679
Speaker 1: But they have that and it still doesn't help.

40
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:15,906
Speaker 0: Well part of that is because even if all the lanes were going in one direction and they just didn't let people go the other Direction, it's still too many cars.

41
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:26,560
Speaker 0: Yep, but so I'm driving I'm stuck in for like an hour in this traffic horrible Whatever and I eventually get up to the bridge and I see oh, there's an accident on the bridge.

42
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:30,913
Speaker 0: Oh, it looks like the police just arrived probably because they had to fight through the same traffic.

43
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:39,360
Speaker 0: I've been sitting in and It's like five cars in a line and they all hit each other except the guy in the front who did was didn't call.

44
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:44,265
Speaker 0: I mean the guy in the front was the only one who can't be blamed because he didn't hit anyone He didn't do anything wrong.

45
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,980
Speaker 1: All right, so, you know, I mean, why did the guy behind it?

46
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:49,451
Speaker 1: The guy in the front hit him in the back.

47
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,740
Speaker 0: probably it was tailgating.

48
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:53,046
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, probably people don't.

49
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:53,748
Speaker 0: people just ride.

50
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,232
Speaker 0: people tailgate me all the time.

51
00:03:55,834 --> 00:04:01,320
Speaker 0: And yeah, I'm one of those people who sometimes I'll just make my brake lights turn on without braking and just to see what they do.

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,965
Speaker 1: I saw a lot of tailgating on Sunday.

53
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:05,755
Speaker 1: Lots of barbecues out behind trucks.

54
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:07,300
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you went to that football game.

55
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,987
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's a tailgating really is.

56
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:12,835
Speaker 0: so I see that the cop you're talking about is following.

57
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:20,560
Speaker 0: the cop was talking to the second to last person in this line of accident cars And I roll down my window cuz he's right there.

58
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:22,572
Speaker 0: I'm gonna drive by it like one mile an hour.

59
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:24,020
Speaker 0: so I get to hear some of this conversation.

60
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:31,623
Speaker 0: And as I roll down my window I hear the cop say you realize this accident is mostly your fault and the guy starts going like no It isn't.

61
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:35,627
Speaker 0: that guy stopped too quick blah blah and the cops like By law.

62
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,155
Speaker 0: if you hit anyone from behind It's your fault because you were following too closely and you were probably speeding.

63
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:46,900
Speaker 0: and at this point I just started laughing and the cop looked up at me and he didn't have an angry look on his face.

64
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:54,440
Speaker 0: He just kind of had this look of like, you know I'd probably laughing too if I was you and the guy's officer not allowed to laugh.

65
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,359
Speaker 1: I have to keep this cold and stern demeanor that makes no one like me.

66
00:04:57,842 --> 00:05:01,120
Speaker 0: I have seen police officers crack up on occasion and it's often hilarious.

67
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:04,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it's got to be real funny because they practice that stern demeanor.

68
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:05,615
Speaker 0: Yes, they do.

69
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:07,040
Speaker 0: They probably go to school for it.

70
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:15,097
Speaker 1: Alright, so I wanna while I'm remembering before I forget Next week we're gonna do all week is gonna be ask rim and Scott.

71
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:16,102
Speaker 1: four days We're gonna.

72
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,720
Speaker 1: all we're gonna do is answer questions from you people.

73
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:27,832
Speaker 1: so if you have some sort of tech question or maybe a video game question or You know If you ask a question make sure you ask it for the right day of the week.

74
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:31,363
Speaker 1: and if the question isn't a Monday Tuesday Or Wednesday question.

75
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:32,768
Speaker 1: It's a Thursday question.

76
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:34,836
Speaker 1: You could ask any question in the whole world.

77
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:39,540
Speaker 1: Nothing is off-limits Nothing, you could ask anything like what's your social security number?

78
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,114
Speaker 0: I just won't answer or I'd probably make something up or I'll give you Scott.

79
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:44,299
Speaker 1: one one one one one.

80
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,415
Speaker 0: Actually, if someone asked that I do have a funny answer, but I'm not gonna ruin it.

81
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:52,527
Speaker 1: in case someone actually asks it I'm sure someone will now that we've talked about it.

82
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:54,414
Speaker 0: I mean there really is a funny and interesting answer.

83
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:59,535
Speaker 1: Yep, but if you want Us to actually answer your question on the show.

84
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:00,319
Speaker 1: Here are some tips.

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,040
Speaker 1: Don't ask a question with an incredibly long answer.

86
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:08,680
Speaker 1: Well, if you do, we'll probably turn it into an entire episode instead of doing you just a question.

87
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,018
Speaker 1: Don't ask a question that could be answered with a Google search.

88
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:13,686
Speaker 1: Don't answer.

89
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:17,380
Speaker 1: don't ask a question that has been answered on a previous episode of geek nights.

90
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:20,486
Speaker 1: Don't ask a stupid question.

91
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:21,730
Speaker 1: I don't know.

92
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,819
Speaker 1: I can't really think of anything else while rim is getting up What looks like a Rico law?

93
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know why I'm just coughing a lot tonight.

94
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:37,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually have the throat sickness I guess cuz it migrated from the nose to the throat I guess with an overnight drip, but I'm not coughing nearly as much as rim is.

95
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:39,120
Speaker 0: I've said the sudden coughing thing.

96
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,691
Speaker 0: I don't know why I gave it to you.

97
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:49,140
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, cuz that one thread in our forum isn't gonna go alight with the idea of Scott giving me a disease of the mouth Mana.

98
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:52,266
Speaker 0: So I've already had mono.

99
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:58,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, so yeah ask us questions in the forum or by email And I guess we're gonna.

100
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:04,460
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make the deadline actually I think Sunday because on Sunday, I'm gonna sort of combine all the questions to Sunday.

101
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,493
Speaker 0: I was gonna say Saturday at midnight say, okay, so that's even for the.

102
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,620
Speaker 1: you want to even make that even for the Thursdays also.

103
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if we don't get it by Saturday like late That's what I'm gonna go through and sort of you know, get all the questions together.

104
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:22,914
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm sure you know you might ask a really good Thursday question on Wednesday and I might see it.

105
00:07:23,014 --> 00:07:25,864
Speaker 1: and I guess if it's really good and I Notice it then I'll throw it in.

106
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:28,533
Speaker 1: but I'm gonna compile the real list on Saturday.

107
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,520
Speaker 1: So or Sunday something like that.

108
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we did this kind of thing a long time ago.

109
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,906
Speaker 0: It was super fun and really popular.

110
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:35,849
Speaker 0: We want to do it again.

111
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:39,540
Speaker 0: And also we we used to plan ahead geek nights.

112
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:51,801
Speaker 0: we actually have a whole internal system of planning ahead geek nights and we've been busy for a while and we hit the end of that geek nights planning last week and We've just been kind of winging it since then Mm-hmm.

113
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:52,844
Speaker 1: All right.

114
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:54,408
Speaker 0: So so what do you got in the news?

115
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:55,371
Speaker 0: Cuz I got almost nothing.

116
00:07:55,993 --> 00:07:58,660
Speaker 1: Well, there's this basketball player named Gilbert arenas.

117
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:05,575
Speaker 1: That's all I know about him is that he's a basketball player and he's I guess he's good and somewhat famous At least in the NBA United States, whatever, right?

118
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:11,400
Speaker 1: So This guy he plays the halo 3. a lot of people are playing the halo 3.

119
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,660
Speaker 1: They've made 300 million dollars off the stupid game.

120
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:15,105
Speaker 1: A lot of people are playing it.

121
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:18,076
Speaker 1: not surprising that a famous NBA player would be playing it.

122
00:08:18,177 --> 00:08:18,899
Speaker 1: He could afford it.

123
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:30,300
Speaker 1: Apparently he was according to a lot of I guess Evidence that we have here even though it seems to be anecdotal evidence, but it seems to be pretty certain that he cheated.

124
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:40,335
Speaker 1: What this guy was doing is he would start a game of halo 3 have his friends join Then his friends would leave and he would win and this would make his rank go up.

125
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:49,210
Speaker 0: That's You realize that that went on in the 90s on like the CLQ and all those things And I guess he could afford a whole bunch of Xboxes.

126
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,060
Speaker 1: so he could really like make a machine out of it.

127
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,958
Speaker 0: In fact, I did that once to see if it would work.

128
00:08:54,961 --> 00:09:02,242
Speaker 0: We made a server that gave you a whole like more points than you should have gotten for everything And a few of us just played on it all the time and sure enough I was.

129
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:07,360
Speaker 0: there was a time when I was in the top 10 according to the CLQ of like weapons factory players in the world.

130
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, hardly cheating.

131
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:15,160
Speaker 1: So because Xbox Live makes all these things like really obvious, you know, they're like, huh?

132
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,142
Speaker 1: well look at that.

133
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:25,279
Speaker 1: and someone says that like they were invited into his party and then they Got booted once he got there and then he noticed what was going on and he uncovered the whole thing.

134
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:27,849
Speaker 0: So, uh, who cares no one.

135
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:30,178
Speaker 1: but I just think it's a pretty interesting sort of.

136
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:37,280
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of drama about oh now he was outed now But there's forums all over the internet that are all abuzz about that.

137
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:45,529
Speaker 1: well I'm actually the news I'm getting is from a forum where the guy is saying that he discovered this and They let me reload it actually because it might have increased.

138
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:45,951
Speaker 1: Hold on.

139
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,540
Speaker 1: I think these are actually the official halo forums.

140
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,087
Speaker 1: It's Bungie dotnet Wow, the.

141
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:55,960
Speaker 1: there are currently 32 pages in this forum thread where they uncovered his cheating ways.

142
00:09:56,202 --> 00:10:06,677
Speaker 0: See it's kind of like with forums how the conventional wisdom in forums was always to have like a post count thing or some sort of ranking system and Video games do the same thing often because a lot of people want that.

143
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:14,707
Speaker 1: but well The reason they do it is because I think blizzard started it with Warcraft 3 at least that's the first one that worked is Where they wouldn't rank you.

144
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:17,500
Speaker 1: they would rank you to say who's the best in the world and stuff like that.

145
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:27,934
Speaker 1: But mostly there was a ranking so that if you wanted to play Warcraft 3 and you were a nub You would get matched up with nubs instead of getting matched up with gods, you know Cuz before used to be random who you'd match up with?

146
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:28,760
Speaker 1: all you know is their name.

147
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:39,378
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah The only point I was getting is that whenever you have a way to may have a stat generated by any means That will allow a 12 year old to say that he is better than another 12 year old.

148
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:45,800
Speaker 0: Every 12 year old is going to try to cheat at that system and someone is going to succeed thus making the system pointless.

149
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:47,813
Speaker 1: And that's a World of Warcraft is all about.

150
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:52,719
Speaker 1: is instead of saying Don't do that other out of bounds thing to make the numbers go up.

151
00:10:52,759 --> 00:11:01,860
Speaker 0: here The game is making the numbers go up play it But then notice how many players say it's cheating if you use a bot or if you level with a macro.

152
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:08,680
Speaker 0: I'm of the mind that if any game will let you level up with a macro then leveling up is not actually an activity.

153
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:11,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, if the computer can do it, why should I do it?

154
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,420
Speaker 1: Why would I spend my time doing something a computer could do automatically?

155
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:17,500
Speaker 0: But yeah, we're not going to get into that.

156
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:23,574
Speaker 0: I think my thoughts on Memorials was perfectly defined by that Richard Garriott thing from yesterday.

157
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,199
Speaker 0: man Scott you're coughing more than I am now.

158
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,187
Speaker 1: Suddenly I agree with you.

159
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:28,874
Speaker 0: It's kind of passing back and forth here.

160
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:30,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, the passing cough.

161
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,828
Speaker 1: Maybe we should call this episode passing cough Like the twit episode naming scheme.

162
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,213
Speaker 0: It is kind of the twit.

163
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:36,714
Speaker 1: Yeah.

164
00:11:36,815 --> 00:11:38,360
Speaker 1: Anyway, what's your news there?

165
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,912
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah my news, so I don't.

166
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,440
Speaker 0: the actual article is shit.

167
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:46,239
Speaker 0: I don't have much to say about it, but there's a lot of meta to talk about around this article.

168
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:50,349
Speaker 0: So someone made a list and posted it on the internet.

169
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,295
Speaker 1: because a list on the internet?

170
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:58,470
Speaker 0: because it was about Blogging and all that stuff something about blogging.

171
00:11:58,972 --> 00:11:59,313
Speaker 0: Of course.

172
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,380
Speaker 0: He got dug way the fuck up.

173
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,930
Speaker 1: Well, it meets the dig digging formula.

174
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,155
Speaker 1: I mean about blogs.

175
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,867
Speaker 1: It's a list That's a million digs.

176
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:08,691
Speaker 1: There you go.

177
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:09,093
Speaker 1: Perfect.

178
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:10,500
Speaker 0: No three points.

179
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,520
Speaker 0: the one thing I'd like to note is that this article claims to be 41 reasons why your blog probably sucks and supposed to be.

180
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:31,754
Speaker 0: you know 41 like things you should do to make a blog better, but All of the advice here is pretty much Here's how to make a blog that will make a bunch of money with Google Ads.

181
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:33,240
Speaker 0: Here's how to wake a blog.

182
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,106
Speaker 0: It'll make a bunch of money with other ads.

183
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:37,132
Speaker 0: Here's how to monetize your blog.

184
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:45,959
Speaker 0: and the other half of this article is Pretty much like the distilled like core of what the blogosphere like.

185
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,249
Speaker 0: everything I hate about the blogosphere everything I hate about all these bloggers Especially at the bottom here.

186
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:57,868
Speaker 0: this last one Things you should never ever do Openly insult another blogger.

187
00:12:57,888 --> 00:12:57,948
Speaker 0: Hmm.

188
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:01,480
Speaker 0: The blogosphere is a lot smaller than you think.

189
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:15,723
Speaker 0: Insulting bloggers are calling them out Will backfire on you possibly for longer than you'd expect and this applies to saying things that people misinterpret as insults These people.

190
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:18,793
Speaker 0: and also there's this whole thing of deep linking and I was like what.

191
00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:20,840
Speaker 0: I don't think they know what deep linking means.

192
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,695
Speaker 0: Cuz they're saying they use this term and in kind of not the right way and I dug a little.

193
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:34,508
Speaker 1: linking is when say rim has a website with an image on it and then on my website, I Actually put his image in my website.

194
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:36,233
Speaker 1: that's loaded from his web server.

195
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:39,845
Speaker 0: or if I want to link to a story on Fox News I don't link to Fox News.

196
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:42,236
Speaker 0: I link to the story inside of Fox News.

197
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:42,638
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

198
00:13:43,180 --> 00:14:01,899
Speaker 0: Well now bloggers when they say deep linking what they mean is every time you post an article You should have a bunch of links just within whatever you wrote To other articles on your blog in order to have this incestuous Internal series of links that'll make you better for the spiders and better for Google to find you.

199
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:09,212
Speaker 1: this whole sort of culture of Search engine optimization and making money from ads.

200
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:11,600
Speaker 1: It's sort of like these people have this fantasy.

201
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,860
Speaker 1: They want to just blog and type things on the internet and not have to work.

202
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:21,260
Speaker 0: And yet all these a lot of these bloggers like one of these things talks about don't try to run too many blogs.

203
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:24,631
Speaker 0: You won't be able to handle it Like anyone will ever have more than one blog.

204
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:29,754
Speaker 0: you get the impression that these people Want to run like four or five blogs about whatever.

205
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:30,980
Speaker 0: they don't care what their writing is.

206
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,000
Speaker 0: They just want to make money from ads and be a blogger.

207
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:34,664
Speaker 1: It's sort of like this.

208
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:46,478
Speaker 1: actually I would consider Google Adsense to be like a very very popular video game that pays real money and these people Try to figure out like the secrets of Google in order to try to just make more money by typing into.

209
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:48,308
Speaker 1: you know Their web servers or whatever.

210
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:50,100
Speaker 0: Well, I'm gonna let them in on a little secret.

211
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,748
Speaker 0: You know how people always rationalize the blocking of ads.

212
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:56,320
Speaker 0: if like well, I wouldn't block a tasteful ad or blah blah blah.

213
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,212
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say that I block Google Ads.

214
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:00,959
Speaker 0: I block all ads.

215
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,492
Speaker 0: The only ads I can't block are ones that are actually in line text.

216
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:06,013
Speaker 0: And you know what?

217
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,059
Speaker 0: I don't go to websites that have that.

218
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also block all ads.

219
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:15,060
Speaker 1: So if your website doesn't have useful content, I don't go to it.

220
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:16,706
Speaker 0: I just this.

221
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:21,364
Speaker 1: the fact it's actually kind of jarring when I see a website with ads cuz it's like Whoa, that's what that website looks like.

222
00:15:21,384 --> 00:15:23,612
Speaker 0: Oh god, cuz I don't use Windows much.

223
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:26,200
Speaker 0: So I didn't install any Firefox plugins in my windows.

224
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:31,932
Speaker 0: I went to a website the other day in Windows and There were ads everywhere.

225
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,878
Speaker 0: The internet is full of ads.

226
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:34,484
Speaker 1: It's scary.

227
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:36,250
Speaker 0: I kind of forgot that there's this.

228
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:38,800
Speaker 0: it's kind of like going into the Wild West without a gun.

229
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,771
Speaker 0: Things of the day, you know.

230
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:54,949
Speaker 0: way back when I was a kid I went to the Michigan State Fair and at the Michigan State Fair There was a ride.

231
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:56,960
Speaker 0: I don't remember what this ride was called.

232
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,560
Speaker 0: I got to find out from my mom what it was called because I'd really like to look up the information about this ride.

233
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:10,076
Speaker 0: But I learned as a kid after the fact that the ride was actually banned in most of the country And it was banned in Michigan not too long after I wrote it.

234
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:19,300
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Apparently this ride Super dangerous and is seriously harmed a lot of people in its relatively short tenure as a carny ride.

235
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:25,131
Speaker 1: It's pretty much like during our Childhood that all the dangerous rides at amusement parks went away.

236
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:32,100
Speaker 0: and they I was at like Farm City week this little festival in Macomb when There was some ride that I used to ride all the time because I loved it.

237
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,134
Speaker 0: We're like spin, you know, one of those spin you around a bunch rides.

238
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:38,728
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and The two-inch thick chain.

239
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:39,531
Speaker 0: that kind of drives.

240
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:41,780
Speaker 0: the whole thing just snapped and flew out into the crowd.

241
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:42,667
Speaker 0: It didn't hit anyone.

242
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:46,500
Speaker 0: some by some miracle It just kind of flew out into the crowd and hit a lamppost.

243
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,320
Speaker 0: But yeah, that was kind of scary and my mom never let me ride it again.

244
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,315
Speaker 0: Yep, despite my argument that the safest place to be when that happened was on the ride.

245
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:56,760
Speaker 0: There's no way it could have hit me there.

246
00:16:57,084 --> 00:17:03,860
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm And the fact that it just broke now that they put it just a brand new chain on it's right the safest ride in the park.

247
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:08,160
Speaker 0: But I'm not gonna talk about the dangerous ride because I don't know the name of it and I don't have all the research.

248
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:16,328
Speaker 0: What I'm gonna talk about is this video of a ride that while not dangerous Might make even someone like me vomit.

249
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:21,406
Speaker 1: it would make me vomit I or pass out from dizziness almost guaranteed and granted.

250
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:26,470
Speaker 0: I have a person who once rode the Gemini at Cedar Point 25 times in a row.

251
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,300
Speaker 1: now the thing with this video is that it's a perfectly normal ride.

252
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,825
Speaker 1: I've seen this ride in many parks.

253
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:32,190
Speaker 1: I've ridden it once or twice.

254
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this one is a little different.

255
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,000
Speaker 0: I mean I feel like I should just make you watch the video to be like just watch it and see if you can figure out what?

256
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,454
Speaker 0: Is different about this ride, but I'll just tell you So it starts spinning around upside down and that's what this ride does.

257
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:47,900
Speaker 1: It's an upside down spinny ride.

258
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,072
Speaker 1: You've probably seen this ride if you've been to amusement park and it doesn't stop.

259
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:54,540
Speaker 1: someone reprogrammed the ride.

260
00:17:55,463 --> 00:18:09,152
Speaker 0: It just it kind of gets into this cycle where it spins in the perfect way and it just keeps doing it and doing it and the crowd just counts down and Wow, yeah, I mean a man, you know the Viking ship right.

261
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:16,404
Speaker 1: the Viking ship goes back and forth Right and it's some Viking ships go upside down some of them upside down some of them don't but let's say of an upside-down Viking ship right.

262
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:20,563
Speaker 1: It's programmed to go one way go over the top three times Go back.

263
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:27,090
Speaker 1: the other way go over the top three times and then stop right you can just reprogram it to go over the top 200 times in a row.

264
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:30,372
Speaker 1: and That's sort of what this video is only not the Viking ship.

265
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:31,015
Speaker 0: Luckily.

266
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:31,740
Speaker 0: No one vomits.

267
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:38,556
Speaker 1: Yeah, these see they clapped when they had the ride stop They're like woo and I wasn't sure if they were applauding like yeah, we're awesome or yay.

268
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:39,440
Speaker 1: This is finally over.

269
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,268
Speaker 1: Yeah, my thing of the day.

270
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:46,048
Speaker 1: So I've been looking for a multi-tool for some time, you know You got the Leatherman's the Gerber's.

271
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:54,046
Speaker 0: every time we go to Home Depot Scott's like I'm gonna buy one Today's the day and then after 20 minutes, he's like But they're all they're all of them.

272
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,375
Speaker 0: match my purse in the shoes.

273
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:57,199
Speaker 1: God damn it.

274
00:18:58,544 --> 00:18:59,495
Speaker 1: The thing is none of the.

275
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:06,647
Speaker 1: you know I've been looking for it with those for a long time and I'm looking for one that has like certain things like I need a Screwdriver and an rj45 crimper.

276
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:08,693
Speaker 1: Yeah and a plier, you know.

277
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:09,976
Speaker 1: and it's one knife.

278
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:13,194
Speaker 1: and oh, you know There's certain things I need and there's things I don't need.

279
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:18,248
Speaker 1: and it seems like They either have a whole bunch of crap I don't need or they don't have everything I do need.

280
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:27,840
Speaker 1: or they're too big or they're ugly or they they're too much money Right, so I've sort of held I don't you know, I haven't suffered without one But I think if I did have one in my bag, I'd be using it a lot.

281
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:36,180
Speaker 1: Well another monkey wrench Pun intended I guess was is just thrown into my multi-tool worries.

282
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:42,880
Speaker 1: There's a company called Atwood knife and tool and they make multi-tools.

283
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:48,519
Speaker 1: However, unlike say a Leatherman or a Gerber their multi-tools do not fold open.

284
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:55,048
Speaker 1: Aha, they are instead just one Solid piece of metal.

285
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:57,355
Speaker 0: I've seen things like that and that's it.

286
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:01,608
Speaker 1: and this one piece of metal Which doesn't move and has no joints or anything.

287
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:04,096
Speaker 0: It's just you can't have pliers or tweezers or anything.

288
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:05,280
Speaker 1: Nothing that nothing.

289
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,043
Speaker 1: that's moving.

290
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:18,516
Speaker 1: but you know, it's it's like a screwdriver and a Bottle opener and a knife and It's like five to ten things all at once and that it's pretty cool.

291
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:22,933
Speaker 1: You'd be like a file and It's it's pretty appealing.

292
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:23,700
Speaker 1: I mean, it's really small.

293
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:30,143
Speaker 1: It does a whole bunch of things at once and there's no moving parts and that has a cute name Right.

294
00:20:30,204 --> 00:20:31,776
Speaker 0: So both are things that they were kind of lame.

295
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:32,300
Speaker 0: Let's just get out.

296
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,714
Speaker 1: Once you go go look at it and you'll be more impressed.

297
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,880
Speaker 1: My description was pretty poor.

298
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,643
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll just say that my choices were either what I did or Scott was trying to get me to do a Salt-and-pepper shaker.

299
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:46,452
Speaker 1: It was only pepper like our 2d2 our 2d2 pepper shakers.

300
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:47,134
Speaker 1: Isn't that cool?

301
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:47,815
Speaker 1: That's cool.

302
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,299
Speaker 1: I'm getting them, right?

303
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:52,690
Speaker 0: So One time in college a pepper grinder.

304
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:59,253
Speaker 0: Sorry kind of on a whim But actually the story of why we did this is kind of interesting into this day.

305
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,560
Speaker 0: I don't know what prompted this.

306
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:05,212
Speaker 1: Okay Well, basically, but it was the same thing that prompted everything else.

307
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:07,120
Speaker 1: you go and you people right?

308
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,726
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I think you forget that something specific prompted us to do this a Conversation with a website.

309
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:15,431
Speaker 0: no before that.

310
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:16,695
Speaker 0: All right.

311
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,080
Speaker 0: I think Scott forgot what happened.

312
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:21,011
Speaker 1: We went so websites were talking about dumpster diving.

313
00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:22,357
Speaker 0: No, no, it was before that.

314
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:23,180
Speaker 0: It was before that.

315
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:24,524
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

316
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:25,387
Speaker 1: Maybe you're making something up.

317
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:31,051
Speaker 0: No, because I what happened was one day I was sitting at my computer and we had a friend.

318
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:49,191
Speaker 0: We don't really need to talk to this person anymore but out of the blue he kind of aims me and I'm aiming back a little bit like yeah, whatever we're talking and Then he says something about dumpster diving and I was like what he's like Yeah, you guys should totally go dumpster diving blah blah blah.

319
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:51,537
Speaker 0: You can make all this money blah blah blah.

320
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:53,705
Speaker 0: and I was like, why would you?

321
00:21:53,726 --> 00:22:05,024
Speaker 1: because this guy never really aimed me anyway, like I hardly talked to this kid If I always if anyone ever comes up and tells you yeah those online casinos you can totally make money from them It's not bullshit.

322
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:12,316
Speaker 1: or there's a there's a way you can game the system or yeah If you totally do this, you'll make money if they're not doing what they just told you to do.

323
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:14,719
Speaker 1: Don't do it They're lying to you.

324
00:22:15,285 --> 00:22:28,793
Speaker 0: I wasn't sure if he did it or not but I talked to him a little bit and I thought just was like, huh and Then it's just dumpster diving stayed in my head and Scott and I started talking about it and we were like Why would he just talk to us about that out of nowhere?

325
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,551
Speaker 1: And if it was really profitable Why isn't he dumpster diving every night?

326
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:34,520
Speaker 0: and then we wondered is he dumpster diving?

327
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,423
Speaker 0: I wasn't sure.

328
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:39,700
Speaker 0: I asked him and he kind of said that he did but he wasn't super clear on it.

329
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,687
Speaker 0: I was like, where did you go?

330
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:50,900
Speaker 0: And he's like, yeah, you know But the seed was planted and less than a week later Kind of out of the blues Scott and I got in my car.

331
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,242
Speaker 1: There was.

332
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:52,369
Speaker 1: there was help from the internet.

333
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:57,000
Speaker 1: cuz you know like anything, you know The internet encourages pretty much every activity you can think of.

334
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,340
Speaker 1: I mean, how many times is there a thing on dig like check out this new thing?

335
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,780
Speaker 1: You can do it and suddenly people are doing it, you know, like buying moleskines or something.

336
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:06,560
Speaker 0: Actually, there's one of those that none of you were gonna guess.

337
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:13,479
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone out there is going to guess what we're doing But we were inspired to do something by the internet, but we'll talk about that later.

338
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,123
Speaker 1: Matchstick rockets.

339
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:16,229
Speaker 0: Mmm.

340
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:20,090
Speaker 0: Oh, I kind of want to make some of those again, even though it never worked It worked barely.

341
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,360
Speaker 0: it worked barely Anyway, so we just kind of like let's go dumpster diving.

342
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:31,419
Speaker 0: so we looked online for like 20 minutes and then we just got in my car and drove over to Best Buy.

343
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:36,194
Speaker 1: and Best Buy uses a big trash compactor compressor thing.

344
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,459
Speaker 1: so you can't actually get in no one.

345
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:42,376
Speaker 0: There is nothing on this earth that would get me to crawl into a trash compactor.

346
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:43,399
Speaker 1: You can't even get in.

347
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,640
Speaker 1: It's not possible because it's basically in the store.

348
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:51,953
Speaker 1: There's a chute that goes into it and a button that Activates it and you have to be in the store to get into that.

349
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:56,430
Speaker 1: and if you went into that There's a chance you could be compacted and killed.

350
00:23:56,611 --> 00:24:03,060
Speaker 1: and you chance you can't get out because like Trash compactor is on the detention level and it'll be quick - you'd be dead real fast.

351
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:06,975
Speaker 1: And - it's probably also the dangerous shit in a Best Buy compactor.

352
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:09,063
Speaker 1: God spray staples Yeah, it's death.

353
00:24:09,524 --> 00:24:10,006
Speaker 1: and three.

354
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,733
Speaker 1: There's no exit hole on it.

355
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,580
Speaker 1: It's because it's taken away by a truck.

356
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:21,309
Speaker 0: So now I learned that from from some Best Buy employees because a lot of businesses do this now Especially businesses like Best Buy.

357
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:30,528
Speaker 0: the two main reasons they do that is one They don't want hobos going through their garbage for various reasons Even though I think if someone's gonna reuse something that's great.

358
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:41,733
Speaker 0: Mmm, but part of it is worry of liability - It's really easy for an employee to just kind of throw something away knowing that his friend Will just go grab it out of the dumpster that night.

359
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:42,639
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

360
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:46,660
Speaker 0: So that's the primary reason is to prevent employees from stealing crap.

361
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:57,007
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz you know, I mean someone returned Something and then it's not gonna go back in the store shelves the store policies throw it out or sell it super discount or something Right, but the store policies throw it out.

362
00:24:57,368 --> 00:25:00,398
Speaker 1: They don't want someone like, you know getting it and not paying.

363
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:13,113
Speaker 0: Yep So undaunted we continue in our track and we drove around much of Henrietta Just looking for dumpsters and then when we found them Trying to convince each other to go into them and look for stuff.

364
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:14,800
Speaker 1: and what did we find?

365
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,626
Speaker 1: Well the Toys R Us we found.

366
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:17,650
Speaker 0: let's get to that last cuz.

367
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,034
Speaker 0: that was the only success story.

368
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:20,580
Speaker 1: It wasn't really a success story.

369
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:23,283
Speaker 0: Well first block Blockbuster.

370
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:25,617
Speaker 0: we were actually tipped off to go to blockbuster.

371
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:35,140
Speaker 0: Uh-huh So we went to blockbuster and we look in and we see Thousands upon thousands of DVD cases and we think hot damn jackpot.

372
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,320
Speaker 1: We got plastic cases for DVDs and CDs for as long as we'll live.

373
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,452
Speaker 0: They were all empty, but they were full-on.

374
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:42,900
Speaker 0: real DVD cases.

375
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,829
Speaker 1: Just yeah the ones that they use for rentals.

376
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:47,320
Speaker 1: just with those late, you know, they just had piece of papers in them.

377
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,480
Speaker 1: So if you just take the paper out, you've got a blank DVD case.

378
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,076
Speaker 0: So we're like a garbage bag full of them and stuck them in the trunk and we kept going.

379
00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:56,260
Speaker 1: we didn't take those with us.

380
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:56,864
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.

381
00:25:57,046 --> 00:25:57,772
Speaker 1: I don't think we did.

382
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:00,927
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure we did Give them to the anime club.

383
00:26:00,988 --> 00:26:02,734
Speaker 0: The anime club was like a and then we didn't.

384
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:04,540
Speaker 1: I don't cuz where are they now?

385
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,282
Speaker 1: What happened to them?

386
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,451
Speaker 0: probably where everything else went from that dumpster diving?

387
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:10,818
Speaker 1: We threw them being around colony.

388
00:26:10,858 --> 00:26:19,740
Speaker 0: So they Anyway, yeah, we go there were DVD cases of blockbuster not much else and we went to the Wegmans and there was garbage in there.

389
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:20,596
Speaker 0: So we didn't go in there.

390
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:21,860
Speaker 1: It was smelly and stinky.

391
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:31,362
Speaker 0: We didn't want to touch that and almost everywhere we went that we thought would be a score with technology Was just a trash compactor and no actual dumpsters and Ever else.

392
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:31,744
Speaker 0: we went.

393
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,992
Speaker 0: the dumpsters were too scary and smelly to go into.

394
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:40,500
Speaker 1: Yeah at big lots Actually, there was a dumpster but like there were actual homeless people diving in that one.

395
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:43,312
Speaker 0: Yeah, like there were already people there and we felt awkward.

396
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,080
Speaker 1: It was like a homeless family at this dumpster.

397
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,925
Speaker 1: We're like, ah, let's go.

398
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:47,012
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz there were.

399
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:48,380
Speaker 0: there was something I don't know.

400
00:26:48,460 --> 00:27:01,125
Speaker 0: It felt kind of sad if I'm a college hipster, dude And Scott's a college hipster dude and we're out dumpster diving because the internet and some guy told us to and these people are dumpster Diving partially for subsistence.

401
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:08,971
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I felt like I was kind of intruding into this space where I didn't belong But at the same time free stuff.

402
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:09,875
Speaker 0: Yeah.

403
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:15,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Well before we get to the Toys R Us thing We didn't really know what to expect.

404
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:26,338
Speaker 0: like we read the internet and there were all these tips But in the end we both put on like old blue jeans and boots and I had a pair of bike gloves that I was wearing because we didn't have work gloves or anything.

405
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,155
Speaker 1: and Work gloves would helped a lot because I would have touched a lot of things.

406
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:33,593
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have otherwise touched Yeah, but the cost of work gloves would have totally mitigated any gains.

407
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:34,757
Speaker 1: work gloves like two dollars.

408
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,180
Speaker 0: Yeah I point out the gains from our adventure.

409
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:46,260
Speaker 0: So we're really getting kind of disillusioned because the internet was like yeah dumpster diving is awesome.

410
00:27:46,421 --> 00:27:57,962
Speaker 0: And again, this guy kind of told us to dumpster dive and to this day I wonder why he told us to dumpster dive, but we weren't really finding much and it was just kind of scary He's.

411
00:27:58,003 --> 00:28:07,076
Speaker 0: ever we went we were always worried The police would come or we'd run into scary homeless people which happened a few times or we'd run into a stoner which wasn't uncommon in Henrietta.

412
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:07,197
Speaker 0: or.

413
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:19,170
Speaker 0: and Then we swing by the Toys R Us thinking oh man action figures gonna be the win and uh jackpot Sort of well, it would have been a jackpot.

414
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,340
Speaker 0: The problem is we didn't follow through with the swing.

415
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,120
Speaker 0: We kind of ended up bunting and then getting called out at first.

416
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,328
Speaker 0: So, uh, we're looking in.

417
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:33,960
Speaker 0: there's two Toys R Us dumpsters and one of them had nothing in it Just like pallets broken pallets and like dead like broken cardboard boxes from toys.

418
00:28:34,302 --> 00:28:55,271
Speaker 0: But the second one I look in and there is more Perfectly good bike paraphernalia than we could fit in my car not paraphernalia parts of bicycles like a derailleur derailleur a wheel You know some handlebars intact bikes by frames Perfectly functional bike frames.

419
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:57,744
Speaker 0: and I looked there was nothing wrong with them But there were no.

420
00:28:57,764 --> 00:29:00,700
Speaker 1: there were no total bikes, but there were enough parts to make some bikes.

421
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,820
Speaker 0: There are enough parts to make a bunch of bikes Yeah.

422
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,977
Speaker 0: And the biggest thing is there were some bike helmets and there were a bunch of weird like bike buzzers and things.

423
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:15,397
Speaker 1: and you know Every Toys R Us is an official Nintendo repair place But it's also they have a bike repair guy that comes, you know, once a week or so.

424
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:16,140
Speaker 0: a little hints.

425
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,079
Speaker 0: Never take a bicycle to get repaired at Toys R Us unless it was a Huffy you bought at Toys R Us.

426
00:29:21,442 --> 00:29:22,167
Speaker 1: No repair for free.

427
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,939
Speaker 0: Never repair a Huffy bike.

428
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:31,160
Speaker 1: My story, you know, I guess the guy was repairing Huffy's and then all the extra parts got just tossing the dumps.

429
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,965
Speaker 0: No, I'm gonna.

430
00:29:32,308 --> 00:29:34,100
Speaker 0: I worked at construction.

431
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:41,852
Speaker 0: Well, like the summer after my freshman year at Kmart though at Kmart But also at Toys R Us and a few other places just kind of was construction crap.

432
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:54,396
Speaker 0: and at one place I went to I was doing construction and an employee came up and said hey you come here And he went to the back and there were like four bikes and he was like fix these bikes.

433
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:59,939
Speaker 0: and then he walked away And I think that's how a lot of those bikes actually get fixed.

434
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:10,346
Speaker 0: Yeah but I think the biggest score was that there were some boxes at the bottom and I opened these boxes because I jumped into the dumpster first.

435
00:30:10,387 --> 00:30:17,780
Speaker 1: eventually Scott came in because he it was actually a pretty nice dumpster to walk in because it was Long and low and flat and there wasn't much in it.

436
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,403
Speaker 1: But bike part.

437
00:30:18,424 --> 00:30:21,260
Speaker 1: so you stand on the bottom of the dumpster and they're just bike parts sitting around.

438
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:25,200
Speaker 0: But there's these cardboard boxes at the bottom and I go to pick one up and it's really heavy.

439
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:27,409
Speaker 0: So I open it and it's full.

440
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:31,565
Speaker 0: if you know those like trick bars that you stick on a BMX bike They may mean pegs.

441
00:30:31,926 --> 00:30:35,840
Speaker 0: Yeah those stupid things that I think have no place outside of the extreme games.

442
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:36,964
Speaker 1: Yep, it was.

443
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:41,780
Speaker 0: it was a box of pegs and there were many boxes and I knew from personal expand.

444
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:48,997
Speaker 0: I went looked on eBay later and sure enough those pegs Even used go for not like not a lot of money, but you know 15 20 bucks.

445
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not bad.

446
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:55,240
Speaker 1: people want to add pegs to their bikes is all culture of bike bike modding.

447
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,805
Speaker 1: And so we like parts.

448
00:30:57,246 --> 00:31:02,803
Speaker 0: all of these boxes are full of perfectly functional usually looking brand new pegs Matching sets.

449
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:06,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we took them all and it took a while cuz they were really heavy.

450
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,800
Speaker 0: We had to kind of like empty the boxes and like work.

451
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:12,360
Speaker 1: We didn't take all of them, but we took a good deal of bike part.

452
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,130
Speaker 0: I took as many as I felt comfortable taking.

453
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:19,569
Speaker 0: we had putting in my strong pedals and some handlebars And okay, and then.

454
00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:21,980
Speaker 0: and then we're like hot damn dumpster diving is awesome.

455
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,700
Speaker 0: We're gonna sell all this shit on eBay and make some money not a lot of money But some money and we get back to colony and we unload the car and it was a lot of stuff and it took a while.

456
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,529
Speaker 0: Cuz this stuff's heavy and it's all made out of metal.

457
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,940
Speaker 0: and then we're all our friends for the next day.

458
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,988
Speaker 0: We're like, yeah, we went dumpster diving last night.

459
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:38,680
Speaker 0: And of course their response is what the fuck?

460
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,820
Speaker 0: Why the fuck's wrong with you dumpsters?

461
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,884
Speaker 0: What are you hobos?

462
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:44,632
Speaker 0: and we're like no look at what we got.

463
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:46,160
Speaker 0: and we have all these bike parts.

464
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,400
Speaker 0: We're gonna sell them on eBay.

465
00:31:47,682 --> 00:31:50,439
Speaker 0: We're gonna make like 500 bucks if we sell all of this stuff.

466
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,390
Speaker 1: We thought we were so cool and everyone else is like, whatever.

467
00:31:53,852 --> 00:31:59,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we're like, yeah great All we got to do is sell this stuff on eBay That box.

468
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:05,331
Speaker 1: first of all, let me just say right now in my whole life I have never once sold something on eBay.

469
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:07,620
Speaker 0: I've never even tried to sell anything on eBay.

470
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,003
Speaker 1: No, I never even tried either.

471
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:13,515
Speaker 1: and in addition to that the box of bike parts sat there until we moved out.

472
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:39,576
Speaker 0: In fact, I remember working at de Bella's the summer after that when we'd been living in that apartment for a long time already and For various reasons I came home with a garbage bag full of bread and I set that garbage bag full of bread on top of The several boxes full of bike parts that had not moved since the day.

473
00:32:39,616 --> 00:32:40,760
Speaker 0: We went dumpster diving.

474
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,126
Speaker 0: Yep, those boxes.

475
00:32:43,186 --> 00:32:46,640
Speaker 0: It wasn't like we kept trying to sell them and they didn't sell on eBay.

476
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:50,089
Speaker 0: We basically said alright We just have to sell these on eBay.

477
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:56,199
Speaker 0: and the boxes did not move Until the day we moved out of colony and on that day we threw them in a dumpster.

478
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:02,459
Speaker 0: The sad thing is I feel like if we'd followed through he would have made the money.

479
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,300
Speaker 1: Maybe there was a potential for making some money.

480
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:15,780
Speaker 1: I don't think all the stuff would have sold though and there were like four auctions for pegs and two of them were up to like 20 bucks Yeah, but I think a lot of the stuff was kind of used in cruddy and it would have been hard.

481
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:18,151
Speaker 0: The pegs the pegs were mostly brand-new.

482
00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:19,316
Speaker 0: They were in perfect condition.

483
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:23,191
Speaker 1: They were matching sets So shiny as you seem to remember.

484
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:24,295
Speaker 0: those the pegs were.

485
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:25,560
Speaker 0: nothing else was the ball.

486
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,880
Speaker 0: The other parts were kind of scuffy whatever fine.

487
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:33,879
Speaker 0: I think the lesson lesson here is if someone aims you and says hey do X?

488
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:36,658
Speaker 0: The default answer should be don't do X.

489
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:41,034
Speaker 1: Well, is that dumpster diving it as an activity?

490
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:42,820
Speaker 1: I mean homeless people got to do it.

491
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,486
Speaker 1: That's what they do.

492
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,940
Speaker 1: Let let them do their thing, right?

493
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,518
Speaker 1: But it can be a profitable and enjoyable activity because it's about as close as we have to.

494
00:33:50,538 --> 00:34:00,863
Speaker 0: you know Like treasure hunting, you know that we haven't in modern items If nothing else for two guys in college who were bored one night because it's not like we ever did homework or anything or went To class.

495
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:04,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we'd already played a bunch of counter-strike that day.

496
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:04,979
Speaker 0: I mean, what else were we gonna do?

497
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,395
Speaker 0: So we went out dumpster diving.

498
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:07,799
Speaker 0: You know what?

499
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:12,060
Speaker 0: It was a pretty adventurous night all together and I would never do it again.

500
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:20,056
Speaker 0: But I think that experience by itself like the amount of time I spent dumpster diving that one night was worth the amount of fun.

501
00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:20,780
Speaker 0: I got in return.

502
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:27,741
Speaker 1: It's sort of like metal detecting like, you know, you do it once you're like woo and then from then on It's the worst thing ever there's.

503
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:28,103
Speaker 1: actually.

504
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:35,719
Speaker 1: some lady wrote a really good article about how she tried to get into metal detecting and Eventually realized it was just a stupid and pointless and crap hobby.

505
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:49,800
Speaker 0: Well, what got me was when I was a kid and my dad informed me that all those articles you see about how someone found a bunch of ancient money Whatever metal detecting are usually fake and our ads paid for by metal detecting companies.

506
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:52,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that seems to be true.

507
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:57,860
Speaker 1: Yep Metal detectors all that stuff just going around looking for shit.

508
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:03,639
Speaker 1: the thing is that the sad truth is that while one man's trash another man's treasure, it's true.

509
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:08,216
Speaker 1: and While there is a chance you'll find something great in the trash and get it for free.

510
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:08,858
Speaker 1: That's awesome.

511
00:35:09,802 --> 00:35:14,375
Speaker 1: The amount of time you have to spend to get a good chance of finding anything good.

512
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:20,135
Speaker 0: our net profit was The negative cost of all the gas I spent driving around

513
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:26,292
Speaker 1: and the time we spent Go and look at in things and the dirtiness we got Climate and dumpsters and the risk to our health and

514
00:35:26,312 --> 00:35:27,840
Speaker 0: the risk to you know, we could have been arrested.

515
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:33,960
Speaker 0: We ran afoul of people and then we had to lug all that stuff out of our own apartment again and throw it away.

516
00:35:34,922 --> 00:35:38,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really I mean if anyone is feeling adventurous and crazy.

517
00:35:38,642 --> 00:35:41,462
Speaker 1: I recommend doing it maybe once but other than that It's not so.

518
00:35:41,482 --> 00:35:46,760
Speaker 0: there's only one time you should ever go dumpster diving and that is if you're actually homeless though.

519
00:35:46,950 --> 00:36:00,540
Speaker 0: well Yeah But if if you're bored and you're in college and someone gets you on instant messenger and says hey dumpster diving The stars just aligned and you're gonna go dumpster diving whether you want to or not I didn't want to go dumpster diving.

520
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,807
Speaker 0: Remember that the moral really was just that.

521
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:12,273
Speaker 0: it's really weird that that guy messaged me out of the blue and I hardly ever talked to him like ever and he was like man dumpster diving like totally out of nowhere.

522
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:25,000
Speaker 0: and the fact that it worked and I went Dumpster diving it was like it was the elaborate plot to get me killed Like maybe he'd hired assassins and they were waiting by the Walgreens dumpster.

523
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,726
Speaker 0: But we just never went to Walgreens.

524
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,139
Speaker 0: like the one place we didn't go is where the ninjas were waiting to kill me.

525
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:33,699
Speaker 0: I don't know, but it was just weird.

526
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:39,279
Speaker 0: and To this day, I'll always remember that I went dumpster diving for no good reason.

527
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:43,840
Speaker 0: Yep, so so I feel like all of you should go dumpster diving.

528
00:36:44,263 --> 00:36:52,340
Speaker 1: Well, I don't think I would suggest you not go dumpster diving But there's something I would suggest you definitely not do and that is this recent trend of freeganism.

529
00:36:53,022 --> 00:37:03,179
Speaker 1: If you heard people, I think we talked about it a little these people basically their philosophy is they're boycotting the evil Economic system of food selling and distribution, which I granted there are.

530
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:06,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what these people do is they eat

531
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:07,490
Speaker 0: food

532
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:18,290
Speaker 1: out of dumpsters and this they got pictures on their website of like someone like Pulling perfectly good potatoes out of a dumpster and putting them a bag and someone else like getting sealed Unexpired loaves of bread out of a dumpster.

533
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,716
Speaker 1: like hey look a loaf of bread.

534
00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:23,773
Speaker 1: it passed the sell-by date But the sell-by date was yesterday and it's still edible today.

535
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:25,320
Speaker 1: I got it at the dumpster at the grocery store.

536
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:34,300
Speaker 1: look at this free bread and I guess that's cool, but Don't do this unless you absolutely have to to survive.

537
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:49,660
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I remember back and we did our you know ten minutes of dumpster diving research before we went out to dumpster dive and a lot of the websites talked about how most of The food you find is gonna be okay, and I just kind of ignored all that and didn't think about looking for food.

538
00:37:49,821 --> 00:38:02,078
Speaker 1: I think I've learned enough from my friend who works Inspecting food in the state of New York that a food I mean, I'm the kind of person who if the milk is one day past the day.

539
00:38:02,098 --> 00:38:06,878
Speaker 0: I Really feel uncomfortable drinking it and I throw away perfectly good food.

540
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:17,960
Speaker 0: sometimes You throw a pretty good food just because if I feel like food is bad It gets tainted like it's the psychosis I have where if I think food is bad Even if it's probably not I really can't bring myself to eat it.

541
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,100
Speaker 0: But at the same time you do have that problem.

542
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:26,273
Speaker 0: However at the same time if I drop food I'll eat it off pretty much any surface that I've dropped it on to.

543
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:27,518
Speaker 1: you do have that problem.

544
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:30,128
Speaker 0: you correctly Admit it, but like if food is rotten.

545
00:38:30,148 --> 00:38:30,952
Speaker 0: I won't eat by.

546
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:31,514
Speaker 0: it is dirty.

547
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:43,766
Speaker 1: I don't care whatever but Eating food out of a dumpster even if like the sell by date was yesterday and it's bread in a plastic bag And it's still sealed Probably not the best idea.

548
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:48,080
Speaker 1: I mean stuff could have happened to it that you don't know that there's a reason they threw it out.

549
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:53,820
Speaker 1: It's it's not fit for human consumption, and you know you might get away with it a few times.

550
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:02,258
Speaker 1: But if you make a habit of being like a freaking and you keep eating food out of dumpsters and things You are going to get some sort of foodborne illness within weeks.

551
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,084
Speaker 1: I guarantee it pretty much.

552
00:39:04,164 --> 00:39:10,340
Speaker 0: someone at RIT got hepatitis because they were eating food that was coming through the dish line at Gracie's.

553
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:17,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh We could do a whole show on Gracie's.

554
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:21,655
Speaker 1: Maybe you should expand that but we don't want to do more episodes on food though.

555
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,820
Speaker 0: No not on food.

556
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,968
Speaker 0: Do you think there's food at Gracie's?

557
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:27,940
Speaker 1: ha ha ha actually you know the food wasn't really that bad.

558
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,215
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't, but that's kind of the joke you got to make.

559
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:32,571
Speaker 0: you know watch hard It's got to get all the way to Gracie's.

560
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,369
Speaker 0: I Actually look back on those days fondly.

561
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:37,058
Speaker 0: Yeah, those were good days, but

562
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:38,804
Speaker 1: I guess I think

563
00:39:39,346 --> 00:39:45,809
Speaker 0: if you if you think dumpster diving would be fun and adventurous to do by all means go do it Because it is kind of fun to do it once and

564
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:49,670
Speaker 1: there are websites that will tell you all the appropriate Precautions to avoid if

565
00:39:49,690 --> 00:40:02,239
Speaker 0: you're in college and not on a weekend But like on a weeknight Especially if you have like class the next morning And it's late at night and only a few of you go Because it's kind of the same surreal experience of watching Space Ghost like it's just this weird.

566
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:15,939
Speaker 0: you're in a place that you're not supposed to be and you're doing stuff you're not really supposed to be doing and Your con your rational brain says this is dumb, but your Space Ghost brain says I'm just gonna keep doing it anyway.

567
00:40:16,662 --> 00:40:17,245
Speaker 0: And it's just it's.

568
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:23,106
Speaker 1: the thing is if you if you before you're disillusioned about it you go out And you think you're really gonna find something.

569
00:40:23,146 --> 00:40:27,660
Speaker 1: so the member with pretty much everything in life the anticipation is better than the reality.

570
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:28,243
Speaker 1: Driving

571
00:40:28,283 --> 00:40:31,641
Speaker 0: around like we're going up to Best Buy, and I see the big dumpster And

572
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:38,787
Speaker 1: I'm sitting there, and I'm thinking about like all the like Disc men that are gonna be sitting in there in packages I'm just gonna take them like a freak disc man,

573
00:40:38,808 --> 00:40:41,357
Speaker 0: and I was like what if someone threw away a scratch TV?

574
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:41,940
Speaker 0: hot shit.

575
00:40:42,121 --> 00:40:42,643
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

576
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:43,468
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

577
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:44,574
Speaker 1: Give her that 70s TV.

578
00:40:44,594 --> 00:40:56,880
Speaker 1: She didn't get rid of for you, but That TV that survived a rainstorm and sitting outside for a week yep, but Yeah, we got there and the reality was much worse than what we thought it was gonna.

579
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:04,826
Speaker 0: But at the same time the reality was only worse after the fact while we were doing it there was still that sensitive Yep even like right.

580
00:41:04,946 --> 00:41:08,860
Speaker 1: even immediately after we got home it still felt just even the next day.

581
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,883
Speaker 0: We're like this was awesome.

582
00:41:09,924 --> 00:41:12,292
Speaker 0: It was the day after the day after we did it.

583
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:17,811
Speaker 0: It wasn't that it became on awesome It was that we just kind of forgot about the whole experience.

584
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:25,020
Speaker 1: We're like hey never mind that yep We noticed we didn't do it again even while we still thought it was so only dumpster died.

585
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:26,666
Speaker 0: And you know that kind of.

586
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:28,393
Speaker 0: this is gonna be fun way.

587
00:41:28,814 --> 00:41:33,351
Speaker 0: if you actually want to get stuff One go to a Goodwill store.

588
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:35,120
Speaker 0: those places are like the hidden off.

589
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:41,700
Speaker 1: Yes The way to actually get stuff for free or almost free is going to Goodwill stores and tag sales and used bookstores.

590
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,792
Speaker 0: And I own three sport jackets.

591
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:46,924
Speaker 0: one of them is Okay, but I don't really like it.

592
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:49,251
Speaker 0: one of them because it's from like high school.

593
00:41:49,913 --> 00:41:57,559
Speaker 0: one of them is super fancy and awesome like it's super expensive, but it was my dad's and it has to be tailored because it doesn't fit me at all.

594
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:00,960
Speaker 0: and The third one that I own looks super good on me.

595
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:09,660
Speaker 0: It's like the best sport jacket I've ever owned and I bought it for like two dollars from a Goodwill and it has a stain on the inside.

596
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,886
Speaker 1: You know what I'm the hobo.

597
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:11,750
Speaker 0: You know what.

598
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:19,600
Speaker 0: it looks really snappy, and I really like If you ever see pictures of me like doing live shows I'm often wearing a sport jacket.

599
00:42:20,144 --> 00:42:22,300
Speaker 0: It's almost always that $2 sport jacket.

600
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:28,757
Speaker 1: Yeah, so tag sales and Goodwill stores are in garage sales or whatever you call them in your area

601
00:42:28,877 --> 00:42:29,659
Speaker 0: and as Emily for

602
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:31,226
Speaker 1: our Superior to die

603
00:42:31,407 --> 00:42:43,849
Speaker 0: on that if you go to a Goodwill store That's in the middle of like a really snooty upper middle-class area You're gonna find a lot of designer stuff at that Goodwill more than you'd expect Seriously, and it's all like a dollar.

604
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:47,685
Speaker 1: and this is why when I get rid of old clothes I put them in the in the bin.

605
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:57,823
Speaker 1: that like goes to Africa as opposed to the Goodwill bin because I know that just someone Else in town might buy the Goodwill stuff, but this way it's going around the world which is farther away from me where I like it.

606
00:43:00,742 --> 00:43:11,779
Speaker 0: Also, if you really want to get pretty good furniture and all sorts of stuff like that or just anything really go to a college Campus in the week before and week after it's time for the kids to move out.

607
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,080
Speaker 0: College kids get a lot of stuff from their parents.

608
00:43:16,362 --> 00:43:19,240
Speaker 0: I'm talking like full dining room sets and everything.

609
00:43:19,802 --> 00:43:28,580
Speaker 0: But the college kids are poor and while parents are often gonna give kids stuff once they go off to college They're not gonna give them money once they're already at college.

610
00:43:29,182 --> 00:43:34,880
Speaker 0: So a lot of kids move out of apartments in the you know in summer and they have all this furniture.

611
00:43:35,402 --> 00:43:37,729
Speaker 0: They can't afford to store it.

612
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,960
Speaker 0: They can't afford to get a truck and take it with them.

613
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:43,018
Speaker 0: They just leave it out.

614
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:44,700
Speaker 1: Sometimes they leave it out.

615
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,680
Speaker 1: Sometimes they try to sell it by hanging flyers.

616
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:47,523
Speaker 0: We left the.

617
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:49,450
Speaker 0: the Scott had this dining room set that just.

618
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:54,639
Speaker 0: our apartment was too small and it was just in the way And it was a nice set but we couldn't keep it.

619
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,360
Speaker 1: That was like the kitchen table for like my house for like my child, but we just couldn't keep it.

620
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:06,286
Speaker 0: So eventually we put it outside and we put a sign on it and it was literally 59 - - which is our dress.

621
00:44:06,306 --> 00:44:13,940
Speaker 0: back then come in and give us five bucks or just take it and You know what I saw in beacon driving to work the other day.

622
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,071
Speaker 1: What do you say, you know those those couches relay sideways?

623
00:44:17,493 --> 00:44:19,420
Speaker 0: Oh, I really like those and it's like roll.

624
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:24,100
Speaker 1: It's like just like a rolled up thing on the right one side and then just flat, you know, those are very Greek.

625
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:25,731
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the kind of thing.

626
00:44:25,752 --> 00:44:26,539
Speaker 0: We'd have to have those.

627
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:30,589
Speaker 1: What's this street for plank?

628
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:32,518
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's one on ver plank with a sign on.

629
00:44:32,558 --> 00:44:38,451
Speaker 1: it said free You'll see here's the thing but it was gonna rain Uh in college and it was sort of like plushie.

630
00:44:38,571 --> 00:44:40,980
Speaker 0: The only thing is I will take a lot of furniture from the street.

631
00:44:41,082 --> 00:44:41,999
Speaker 0: I've done that in the past.

632
00:44:42,702 --> 00:44:50,480
Speaker 0: I will never take any furniture that is cushy or soft or as cushions because I Always imagine crabs in the mattress.

633
00:44:50,684 --> 00:44:52,342
Speaker 1: I always imagine Exaggeration.

634
00:44:52,422 --> 00:45:00,105
Speaker 0: that there's bugs in it or bedbugs or something and I just don't want to deal with crabs in a mattress is a very real Problem.

635
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:02,540
Speaker 1: you mean mattresses are the most scary.

636
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,359
Speaker 1: But you see my couch and then stuff gets are crawling out of it.

637
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:07,226
Speaker 0: If you see a liquor cabinet grab it.

638
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,973
Speaker 0: if you see like an end table grab it.

639
00:45:09,455 --> 00:45:11,849
Speaker 1: if you see a chair That's solid.

640
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:12,858
Speaker 1: grab the mattress.

641
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,472
Speaker 1: No, yeah, never take a used mattress.

642
00:45:16,492 --> 00:45:17,214
Speaker 0: God ever.

643
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,820
Speaker 0: Oh gathering by a used mattress.

644
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:24,738
Speaker 0: They're you unless you need something to set on fire Dude, I wouldn't take a used mattress from someone I knew.

645
00:45:25,502 --> 00:45:26,426
Speaker 1: Used matches the worst thing.

646
00:45:26,446 --> 00:45:29,882
Speaker 1: I take a used mattress for my mom because I know about the mattress I'd probably take.

647
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:32,190
Speaker 1: don't take a strange used mattress.

648
00:45:32,351 --> 00:45:34,880
Speaker 0: Yes, especially if you don't know where it came from.

649
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless you know the entire history of the mattress don't take it.

650
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:44,227
Speaker 0: I'd be more inclined to take the mattress that was on fire than the mattress I just came from.

651
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:45,313
Speaker 1: no matches that was on fire.

652
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:46,118
Speaker 1: to them crabs in it.

653
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,123
Speaker 0: At the very least.

654
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:52,188
Speaker 0: I carried the mattress on fire in front of someone else's apartment so I can get into my next to the Flaming bag of poo.

655
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,805
Speaker 1: Yeah Anything else to say?

656
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:55,387
Speaker 1: I don't know.

657
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:57,517
Speaker 0: the show kind of went nowhere because what we went?

658
00:45:57,537 --> 00:46:02,493
Speaker 0: dumpster diving Because someone told us to and we spent 10 minutes researching it.

659
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:06,683
Speaker 0: Well, maybe 20 minutes researching it on the internet and We didn't.

660
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:08,980
Speaker 1: nothing came of it and it's not the greatest thing ever.

661
00:46:09,981 --> 00:46:13,472
Speaker 1: Just go on eBay and find exactly what you want and try to get.

662
00:46:13,572 --> 00:46:17,263
Speaker 0: it really is kind of a dumpster and instead of spending Time you spend money.

663
00:46:17,564 --> 00:46:17,785
Speaker 1: Yep.

664
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:23,941
