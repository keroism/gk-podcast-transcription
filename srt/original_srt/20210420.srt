1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,569
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, April 20th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:10,891
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:14,640
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,245
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:21,481
Speaker 1: We are reviewing Pac-Man 99.

6
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,519
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:36,980
Speaker 1: So we're not going to dwell on this, not because it's not important and not because we don't think people should talk about it, but because there are a lot of non-white voices you can listen to about this right now.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:54,679
Speaker 1: Like, you really don't need the opinions of two white dudes doing a podcast, but Derek Chauvin, the cop who murdered George Floyd on video, was surprisingly, which I think that word is a, that's a load-bearing word right there, was found guilty on all counts.

9
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,900
Speaker 1: He was taken to jail, like right after the trial, a little bit before we did Geek Nights.

10
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:04,879
Speaker 0: Well, it's 2021, and is that the fucking first time that that's happened?

11
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:05,239
Speaker 0: Jesus Christ.

12
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:11,580
Speaker 1: The fact that that is news in 2021, correct verdict found in murder trial of black men by police officers.

13
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:20,180
Speaker 0: I mean, this still isn't justice, you know, which would be George Floyd not being dead, right?

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,560
Speaker 1: Yep.

15
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:27,120
Speaker 1: Maybe systemic reform of the concept of policing such that armed white dudes with guns don't show up and just murder people.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not nothing.

17
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:31,466
Speaker 1: It's a little baby step.

18
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,552
Speaker 1: It was in the context.

19
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:36,540
Speaker 1: It was the right thing, but it's far from enough.

20
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,605
Speaker 1: But don't ignore this.

21
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:40,790
Speaker 1: Like, honestly, go read the news.

22
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:42,660
Speaker 1: Go look at black voices speaking about this.

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,420
Speaker 1: There's really nothing we can add to that, but we also can't just stay silent.

24
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:54,236
Speaker 1: I mean, Black Lives Matter, if you're coming to a podcast looking for escapism, that is, Geek Nights is not the place for you.

25
00:01:56,688 --> 00:01:57,220
Speaker 1: Just saying.

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:11,549
Speaker 0: I was just saying before the show, for some reason, human history, or I guess our society in recent history, really loves to make a lot of significant events happen on 420.

27
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:16,460
Speaker 0: Watch out one year from now.

28
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,825
Speaker 1: There's no good way to segue.

29
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:29,439
Speaker 1: The thing that's always bothered me about regular news is that they'll talk about something serious and heavy, like what we just talked about, and then there'll be that slight pause, "In other news, puppies found in...".

30
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:34,140
Speaker 1: Those transitions are hard to navigate, so we're just going to do a hard break.

31
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:42,293
Speaker 1: But the best tweet I saw about 420, irrespective of all the real news that happened today, was, "Happy birthday to

32
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:42,614
Speaker 1: weed.".

33
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:47,499
Speaker 1: So, yeah, honestly...

34
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:50,238
Speaker 0: This dog says, "Don't remember to leave milk and cookies out for

35
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:50,339
Speaker 0: him.".

36
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:54,847
Speaker 1: But yeah, go read about.

37
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:59,640
Speaker 1: if you somehow don't know about the trial of Derek Chauvin, the man who murdered George Floyd.

38
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:01,364
Speaker 1: Go read about it.

39
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:10,240
Speaker 1: This is important, and there's going to be a lot more conversation about this everywhere, and you cannot and should not avoid that conversation.

40
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:17,360
Speaker 1: And also be very suspicious of anyone who has a media platform who doesn't say anything about it at all.

41
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:25,880
Speaker 1: People who are completely silent about this are probably trying to avoid "controversy," and that implies they're probably a bad person.

42
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,040
Speaker 1: Like, benefit of the doubt is not given in those circumstances.

43
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,180
Speaker 0: And obviously, if anyone is saying that this is wrong, you don't even need to hesitate.

44
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,877
Speaker 0: Just be like, "Block, report, ban,

45
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:39,100
Speaker 0: whatever.".

46
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,171
Speaker 1: Yep, just block, report immediately.

47
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:42,919
Speaker 1: Kick them out of whatever platforms you own.

48
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:50,500
Speaker 1: Pretty confident we won't see any of that in the GeekKnives community, but if anyone's out there, like, your days are numbered in our community at least.

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
Speaker 0: The GeekKnives community is, you know, a polished police, whatever.

50
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,515
Speaker 1: Yeah.

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,780
Speaker 1: So, in other news, there is gigantic news in the gaming world.

52
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,960
Speaker 1: There's a game you might have heard of called... Most places call it football, but in America they call it soccer.

53
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:14,500
Speaker 1: This news is actually way bigger than you might realize if you don't pay attention to the news around football.

54
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:34,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm sure a lot of our listeners are in other parts of the world who are soccer fans and already know more than I know and more than we can say about this topic, but I did research it and I know enough that if there is anyone who is perhaps from the United States or doesn't know anything about soccer or football, I can inform you greatly.

55
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:39,060
Speaker 0: And as people who know a lot about games, we can comment on that as well.

56
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,370
Speaker 0: So here's what happened, right?

57
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:41,460
Speaker 0: I gotta lay some groundwork.

58
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,960
Speaker 0: In the United States, we just have professional sports leagues and that's sorta it, right?

59
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,040
Speaker 0: We only have national teams for, like, Olympics and stuff, right?

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,120
Speaker 0: We don't really care about those or pay attention to those.

61
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,339
Speaker 0: Other countries, they do care about national teams, right?

62
00:04:57,142 --> 00:05:01,160
Speaker 0: But they also have, you know, non-national teams, right?

63
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:04,180
Speaker 0: So for soccer, you'll have something like the World Cup.

64
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,780
Speaker 0: And when you have the World Cup, you have national teams, right?

65
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,060
Speaker 0: Spain versus France versus Germany versus Sude, you know, whatever country, right?

66
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:20,200
Speaker 0: But the other sports leagues, you know, everywhere around the world, there are different soccer leagues for different parts of the world.

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,280
Speaker 0: There's South American soccer leagues, Australian soccer league, right?

68
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,823
Speaker 0: All different.

69
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,220
Speaker 0: Everyone's got different regional leagues.

70
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,000
Speaker 0: You know, FIFA is the international one, right?

71
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:34,820
Speaker 0: But in Europe, they have UEFA, right, which is European soccer.

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,600
Speaker 0: So each country in Europe, right?

73
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:45,480
Speaker 0: So like in Britain, in the UK, they've got their Premier League, which is the top level soccer, but it's only UK soccer.

74
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:48,960
Speaker 0: And then underneath, they've got like FA Cup, right?

75
00:05:49,302 --> 00:05:56,300
Speaker 0: And then in Germany, you've got like the Bundesliga, which is German soccer that has different tiers of skill levels, right?

76
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,679
Speaker 0: The top one and then minor leagues underneath it.

77
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:10,254
Speaker 0: But then you have UEFA, and UEFA is basically like saying, "Okay, imagine if Canada had a separate baseball and Mexico had a separate

78
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:10,860
Speaker 0: baseball.".

79
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,159
Speaker 0: And Japan does have a baseball and Korea has a baseball, right?

80
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,100
Speaker 0: And those are all professional leagues.

81
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:28,838
Speaker 0: Imagine if there was a like North America, okay, whoever won the World Series in the United States and the World Series of Canada and the World Series of Mexico are all going to fight each other, right, and get another battle.

82
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,100
Speaker 0: So it's like they have this thing in Europe called the Champions League.

83
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,458
Speaker 0: And it's basically like, "Oh, you know, we're going to take the best teams from the Premier League and the Bundesliga,

84
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:41,640
Speaker 0: right?".

85
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,879
Speaker 0: These aren't national teams.

86
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,600
Speaker 0: It's not Team Germany with all German players.

87
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,440
Speaker 0: It's just the best team from the German Soccer League, which might not even have all German players on it, you know.

88
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:52,841
Speaker 1: Yup.

89
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:55,521
Speaker 1: Now, a lot of the reasons why this whole structure exists, like.

90
00:06:55,542 --> 00:07:05,259
Speaker 1: there's a long, complicated history of sports, I think a lot of Americans have a very skewed idea of how sports work because American sports are pretty unique in how monolithic they are.

91
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:07,787
Speaker 0: Yes.

92
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:25,113
Speaker 0: But basically, every year they have this Champions League where the best teams from all the country leagues get together, right, and they battle it out, and then the champion of that, that's basically like the World Series of, you know, the Super Bowl of European soccer.

93
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,140
Speaker 0: It's like enormous, right?

94
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,440
Speaker 0: Other than the World Cup, that's like the biggest fucking deal, right?

95
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:30,420
Speaker 0: The Champions League.

96
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:45,419
Speaker 0: I think they even have like a Champions Super Cup where it's like whoever wins the EuroLeague and whoever wins the Champions League play one game against each other, and that's like the Super Super Bowl, right?

97
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:59,740
Speaker 0: Regardless, what's happened is that basically teams, you know, in each of these country leagues, right, it's like in the Premier League, some teams are bigger than others, right?

98
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,780
Speaker 0: You know, Liverpool is a bigger team than like I guess Man City, right?

99
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,419
Speaker 0: Even though Man City I think has risen, I've heard, for what I've paid attention to it, right?

100
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,200
Speaker 1: But not to be confused with Manchester United.

101
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,559
Speaker 0: Clearly not the same team.

102
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,960
Speaker 0: You know, in Spain, right, in the Spanish Soccer League, obviously Real Madrid is a bigger team, right?

103
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:31,819
Speaker 0: You know, and those same teams, like Real Madrid, even though it'll be participating in different leagues, it's like the same team playing in different tournaments, right?

104
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:34,220
Speaker 0: You don't see that in the United States.

105
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,698
Speaker 0: You don't see the New York Mets playing in different baseball tournaments besides Major League Baseball, right?

106
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:48,075
Speaker 0: But that's how it is in Europe, right, and other parts of the world for soccer, is the same club will engage in different tournaments, right, and try to win them.

107
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,880
Speaker 0: So basically, teams are not all on the same level.

108
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,240
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of parity, and they have other things like relegation.

109
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:10,595
Speaker 0: So what has happened is in order to make money and make also, you know, partially encouraged by, you know, the loss of money in the COVID times, the best teams, like the top tier teams, the Real Madrid's of the world, right?

110
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:13,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, 12 teams were part of this, at least originally.

111
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,640
Speaker 1: There's breaking news in the last few hours about this that we'll get to.

112
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:30,719
Speaker 0: Yes, so like 12, like the best teams from all around Europe, right, the ones with the most money, the most fans, the best players, the big deal ones, right, from several different leagues got together and on their own said, "You know what?

113
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,240
Speaker 0: We're going to make this Super League, right?

114
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:42,700
Speaker 0: We're just going to play fucking each other, right, and then maybe we'll let, you know, the five best other teams play with us, but those slots aren't permanent slots.

115
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,820
Speaker 0: We're going to give ourselves permanent slots because the Champions League that exists now, there's no permanent slots on that.

116
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,158
Speaker 0: You have to earn your way into it by winning, right?

117
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,620
Speaker 0: So if you have a big expensive team that's with all the best players and for some reason you stink it up one year, you're not going to be in the Champions League.

118
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:58,688
Speaker 0: You're going to not win

119
00:09:58,728 --> 00:09:58,910
Speaker 0: that.".

120
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:19,440
Speaker 0: So the Super League is basically like, "Hey, if we just have all the best teams from all around Europe, the most popular ones, just play each other in our own tournament and we invite in a few other teams, you know, that are the best ones each year to sort of round out the field, that will be the most watched, most popular league.

121
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:25,480
Speaker 0: Screw your Champions League and screw your, you know, whatever normal league you're playing in, right?

122
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:31,140
Speaker 0: This is where the money is going to be in the Super League that we just made, sort of like in, you know, college football, right?

123
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,979
Speaker 0: You'll have like the best teams, you know, they don't care about playing these other Garbo colleges no one ever heard of.

124
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:42,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not making like Michigan State's hockey team play against RIT despite them technically being Division 1.

125
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,100
Speaker 1: Like they break it up, good teams play good teams, there's a whole system.

126
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:59,580
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this announcement that came out of nowhere has basically gotten all kinds of negative backlash, of course, because basically the individual leagues, right?

127
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,918
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, the Spanish league is like, "Oh, you're going to go and do that?

128
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,770
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll just kick Real Madrid out of the Spanish league, you want to do that, huh?

129
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:07,135
Speaker 0: Yeah.".

130
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:18,580
Speaker 1: The fan reactions were, because football fans internationally, for a lot of reasons, care about their sport in a lot of different ways from how the average American cares about American-centric sports.

131
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:22,380
Speaker 1: So fans were not happy.

132
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:31,740
Speaker 1: If there's one thing you can say that is pretty universal among hardcore football or soccer fans globally, they don't like things to change generally about the sport.

133
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:39,820
Speaker 1: They want the rules to say the same, they want the traditions to hold, they want the clubs to be the center of attention or the center of how things are structured.

134
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,460
Speaker 1: It's just radically different from how, if you watch American football, things work.

135
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,740
Speaker 1: So fans were outraged to a degree that surprised a lot of people who are not soccer fans.

136
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,080
Speaker 0: And also, you know, you got to think about, it's like, what does it mean to win, even if they just went through with this and everyone was okay with it, right?

137
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,700
Speaker 0: It's like, well, now what would it mean to win the Champions League, right?

138
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,797
Speaker 0: It's like suddenly the meaning of the other tournaments changes, right?

139
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:09,994
Speaker 0: You think about tennis, you have a grand slam of tennis every year.

140
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,980
Speaker 0: There's four major tennises, US Open, French Open, Wimbledon, Australian Open, right?

141
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,880
Speaker 0: If you add a fifth one, suddenly what does that mean for all the previous years of tennis?

142
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,820
Speaker 0: If you take away one, what does that mean, right?

143
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:29,280
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you need some continuity.

144
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,960
Speaker 1: Well, compare it to like any American sport.

145
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,444
Speaker 1: Like hockey's.

146
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:34,000
Speaker 1: good because we're getting near the end of the season.

147
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,720
Speaker 1: With hockey in America, there were multiple hockey leagues in the ancient past of America.

148
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,291
Speaker 1: Eventually one became the league.

149
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:43,460
Speaker 1: everyone agreed was the one.

150
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:47,398
Speaker 1: And everything else either disappeared, became a minor league, got folded in, et cetera.

151
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:57,580
Speaker 1: I'm not going to explain the history of the NHL, but the NHL now, because of money, consolidation, everything else, they are literally the best hockey teams in the world.

152
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,440
Speaker 1: There aren't other hockey teams that could even compete with them pretty much anywhere.

153
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:11,160
Speaker 1: So the NHL sort of exists as the place where the worst team there is probably still better than the best team in literally any other league on earth for hockey.

154
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:13,780
Speaker 1: That is so far from true with football.

155
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:21,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you might have some of the best players in the world in, you know, the German league or the Premier League, right?

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:32,160
Speaker 0: And it's like, those players are going to whoever spends the most money, and all those leagues make enough money to have at least some clubs in some of those leagues have enough money to pay those players.

157
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,200
Speaker 0: So it's not like literally all the best players in the world are in the league in one country, right?

158
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Speaker 0: But if you look at maybe the Champions League, then yeah, maybe.

159
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,600
Speaker 0: But then again, there might be some players playing in South America.

160
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,640
Speaker 0: That's just why the World Cup matters a lot more.

161
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,240
Speaker 0: People don't care too much about the World Cup of hockey as much as they could.

162
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:53,722
Speaker 1: Yep.

163
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:57,140
Speaker 1: So the fascinating thing was the backlash.

164
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,260
Speaker 1: Like, I did see people on my feed who were actually pro this when it first announced, but mostly they were all Americans.

165
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,520
Speaker 1: I went back through my tweets, literally every person who was excited or tweeted positively.

166
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,860
Speaker 0: Well, because conceptually it's like, oh, all the best teams will play against each other in this awesome mega league.

167
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,240
Speaker 0: That sounds cool, but actually, no, it's a money grab.

168
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:25,580
Speaker 0: All these best, these, you know, basically billionaires, right, trying to fuck over the millionaires who own the smaller teams by basically just leaving their league.

169
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:36,519
Speaker 0: If you're in the Spanish league and you're a smaller team, you get to play against Real Madrid and you get money when you play against them and you get money when they come to visit you and play against you.

170
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,820
Speaker 0: They're just going to leave and be like, we don't want to play with you anymore.

171
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,659
Speaker 0: We're just going to play against the other billionaire owned teams.

172
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,619
Speaker 0: All the millionaires are losing a lot of money on that.

173
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:47,400
Speaker 1: And what does that look like in the US?

174
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,440
Speaker 0: Making a lot of money.

175
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:55,040
Speaker 1: A lot of hockey teams disappeared because if you can't make money playing in the NHL, there's nowhere for you to go.

176
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,679
Speaker 1: The Hartford Whalers just disappeared.

177
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,379
Speaker 0: They went to Carolina.

178
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:01,240
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, some teams go completely bankrupt.

179
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:04,060
Speaker 1: Some teams, the franchise gets renamed and moved somewhere else.

180
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,840
Speaker 1: Sometimes it gets moved without being renamed.

181
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,739
Speaker 1: There's actually a lot of hockey teams you've probably never heard of.

182
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,260
Speaker 0: It's also, you know, for, you know, soccer is not a meritocracy.

183
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:20,240
Speaker 0: Obviously nothing is, but this is definitely significantly less meritocracy, right?

184
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:33,411
Speaker 0: And that the Champions League, at least nominally, is like, yeah, if somehow this shit garbo team in, you know, some league that no one ever heard of suddenly is way good one year, you know, there's some phenomenon or whatever, they could win it.

185
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:34,198
Speaker 0: It could happen.

186
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:47,320
Speaker 1: But you also see the, you know, the lack of parity because this is a problem, especially like, I remember when we talked about footy a long time ago in Australia and how like one team is just better than everyone else because there aren't that many people who are good enough in that sport.

187
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,940
Speaker 1: With soccer, lots of people are good at it, but a lot of American sports will have things like salary caps or league rules that force some...

188
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,860
Speaker 0: Those are also, you know, that's about keeping labor costs down.

189
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Speaker 1: It's about keeping labor costs down, but it also, if you look just at individual games, it ostensibly forces some amount of parity within those leagues.

190
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:10,920
Speaker 0: That's how they sell it to fans, right?

191
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,960
Speaker 0: Because it's not untrue, but that's how you basically get fans to take the side of the owners against the players.

192
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:25,080
Speaker 1: But the alternative isn't great either with completely unrestricted salary caps or a non-managed league.

193
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:34,575
Speaker 1: You could get into a situation where, oh, the Red Wings and the Rangers and a few other teams that have a lot of money literally just buy all the best players and do very well all the time.

194
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:35,760
Speaker 1: Yankees, Yankees.

195
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:38,280
Speaker 0: Yankees aren't doing well right now.

196
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,113
Speaker 1: They're not, but that's why this is complicated.

197
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:45,540
Speaker 1: There's pros and cons of all the different structures.

198
00:16:45,640 --> 00:17:04,020
Speaker 1: I'm not saying the American system is great, but the backlash was so great on this that apparently Ed Woodward, who's the chairman of Manchester United, resigned today over this, over the backlash to join the European Super League in the first place.

199
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:08,699
Speaker 1: They then redacted that and said that he had been planning to leave all along and just happened to announce it.

200
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:10,038
Speaker 1: I don't buy that for a...

201
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,079
Speaker 0: The timing is suspicious.

202
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,977
Speaker 1: Tell you what, if you believe that, I got, there's a bridge I can see outside my window.

203
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:16,579
Speaker 1: that'd be happy to sell.

204
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:29,320
Speaker 0: I never even heard of this person before, but it's like if you're going to retire and suddenly a big news related to you that is negative happens, it's like, don't, even if you were planning to retire, hold, just don't announce that retirement.

205
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,680
Speaker 0: Go home, you know, act like a retired person, but just don't announce anything until a little bit later.

206
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:45,580
Speaker 1: PR rule number one, it doesn't matter what the truth is, if the appearance is real bad, it's going to be just as much of a problem for you as if it's literally true.

207
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,730
Speaker 1: Case in point, we were playing Among Us the other night.

208
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,280
Speaker 1: I didn't murder someone.

209
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:54,500
Speaker 1: I walked, I literally found the body and looked like I was walking in one direction.

210
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,920
Speaker 1: Scott saw me and reported it and claimed that I was the imposter.

211
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:01,460
Speaker 1: I was the imposter, but I did not murder that person.

212
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,780
Speaker 1: The truth of me not murdering that person did not in any way impact the fact that Scott saw me walking away from a body.

213
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:25,470
Speaker 1: So as of 5.55 PM Eastern Time, like breaking news right before we record the show, Arsenal announced a link to it, quote, "As a result of listening to you and the wider football community over recent days, we are withdrawing from this proposed Super League.

214
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:27,879
Speaker 1: We made a mistake and we apologize for

215
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:27,959
Speaker 1: it.".

216
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,159
Speaker 1: They spelled "apologize" with an S, sure.

217
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:36,980
Speaker 1: So yeah, the Super League basically completely collapsed, as far as I can tell.

218
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,919
Speaker 1: I don't think it's going to happen.

219
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,185
Speaker 0: No, I guess that's good.

220
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:42,735
Speaker 0: It's a win for millionaires in the fight against billionaires.

221
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:48,640
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's not a win or a loss for the sport.

222
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:53,180
Speaker 1: It's just a historic moment for the sport, is what I would say.

223
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,900
Speaker 1: Because there are pros and cons of all these different kinds of structures.

224
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:11,440
Speaker 1: One could argue that on average, Super League games, had it come to fruition, might have been individually more entertaining as just instances of soccer being played among professionals than the average soccer game that gets played today.

225
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:12,780
Speaker 1: You could make that argument.

226
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:25,280
Speaker 0: Well, I think what would have happened, likely, is that Super League would have become a lot like the leagues we have in the United States, where that league has just more money than any other league that exists.

227
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:34,340
Speaker 0: And thus, all the best players from all around the world would be in that league, and every other league would be a second-tier league at best.

228
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,560
Speaker 0: Even the existing Premier League and Bundesliga, they would all be second-tier leagues at best.

229
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:43,040
Speaker 0: That would be the league that is the top league.

230
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:49,539
Speaker 0: Other than that, only the World Cup would be the only other top-tier soccer that existed.

231
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:59,979
Speaker 1: While fans would probably try to argue that, "No, the spirit of soccer, we would stick to our other teams," I think the other leagues would probably do way better than minor or alternative leagues do, say, in the U.S

232
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:09,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're sustaining themselves now without second- and third-tier soccer leagues now sustaining themselves in all around the world.

233
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,960
Speaker 0: They would continue to do so, but that would be the top league in the world.

234
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:22,360
Speaker 1: I bet the Super League would have drawn a lot of international viewers from outside of Europe, way more than European leagues already do.

235
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,543
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

236
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:24,720
Speaker 0: Anyway.

237
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:35,280
Speaker 1: But yeah, this is a continuing-to-evolve situation, so everything we've reported on on this is as of 6.45 PM-ish Eastern Time on 4/20.

238
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,059
Speaker 1: So, who knows what will happen by the time you actually listen to this.

239
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:46,639
Speaker 1: In other big news, Jeff Kaplan, the game director for Overwatch, is leaving Blizzard after nearly 20 years.

240
00:20:48,262 --> 00:20:50,054
Speaker 0: Right, so what does this mean?

241
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:50,920
Speaker 0: Eh, whatever.

242
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:58,240
Speaker 0: It feels like every single Blizzard person who we know their name has left Blizzard, and it's now like a ship of Theseus over there.

243
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:07,640
Speaker 1: I think at this point, almost everyone I have met enough times to know their name and be friendly with them, and have exchanged things like phone numbers and email addresses, has left Blizzard.

244
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:27,160
Speaker 0: Activison Bob Blizzard, the "real" Blizzard people were there for a while, then there was the layoff situation, and then slowly but surely, the big name people at Blizzard peeled away and have been replaced by whoever else was waiting behind them.

245
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:36,100
Speaker 0: And now, I think every game at Blizzard has a new, not-the-original crew on it, and all those other people are working on something else somewhere else.

246
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,613
Speaker 1: So, Aaron Keller, who's worked with Kaplan, is taking over.

247
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:41,280
Speaker 1: I don't think anything will fundamentally change.

248
00:21:41,800 --> 00:22:19,220
Speaker 1: But what's notable is that Kaplan, in my opinion, as someone who plays a lot of Overwatch, and that's the space in gaming, we don't talk about as much on Geek Nights because Scott doesn't play FPSs anymore, but I think Kaplan did possibly the best job that could have been done with a game like this, and I think he was instrumental in the game, not to minimize the efforts of everyone else involved, but he did a good job of steering the game to take immediate hard stances on things like game design decisions, to make sure that they didn't ruin the game, they always did the right thing, they supported the Overwatch League in competitive play without giving up on casual play.

249
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:32,300
Speaker 1: I think the game has enough momentum and foundation to basically continue without loss, but in the longest term, I wonder what this means for Overwatch 2 and beyond.

250
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,560
Speaker 1: I wonder if different decisions might be made, particularly around community management, but we'll see.

251
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,160
Speaker 1: I don't know enough about Aaron Keller to say anything about that yet.

252
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,640
Speaker 0: Hearthstone has survived all this time, and the original people have long gone.

253
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,800
Speaker 1: I think the difference is Hearthstone is much more of a casual game where there's a lot more grind.

254
00:22:49,062 --> 00:22:50,756
Speaker 1: There's no grind in Overwatch, if you're good, you're good.

255
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,538
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of grind in Hearthstone, you just spend the money.

256
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, spend the money, spend the time, get in the tournaments, whatever.

257
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:04,040
Speaker 1: Overwatch, if you're good, you can be top tier contender immediately, if you're actually that good.

258
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:12,179
Speaker 1: But anyway, we'll see how that progresses, we'll try to talk more about Overwatch again once Overwatch 2 comes out.

259
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:20,580
Speaker 1: Scrabble has banned a whole bunch of racial slurs from the official Scrabble game.

260
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:32,659
Speaker 0: That's good, because there have been times in my life where I have had racial slurs, tiles, just handed to me, and they've been worth a lot of Scrabble points, and it's like, "Well, do I play

261
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:32,759
Speaker 0: them?".

262
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:40,679
Speaker 0: It's like, it's good to now say, "Yes, do not use those words in Scrabble, they're against the rules, get

263
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:40,959
Speaker 0: bent.".

264
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:43,740
Speaker 0: I approve, that is very nice.

265
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,298
Speaker 1: The other thing I approve of is that the way they did it, is they did not publish the list of the 400 words they removed.

266
00:23:51,520 --> 00:24:00,077
Speaker 1: Because it seems, it appears they were worried people would use that list as a list of offensive terms, like they basically just said, "No, don't use these

267
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:00,319
Speaker 1: words.".

268
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,360
Speaker 0: They just published a new Scrabble dictionary and removed 400 words from it.

269
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Speaker 1: Yes, and the biggest part is there's the official Scrabble dictionary checker, like the online thing you can use.

270
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,200
Speaker 1: Those words just do not show up as valid anymore.

271
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:25,780
Speaker 1: There appears to be a significant amount of pushback and anger from a subset of the competitive Scrabble world, and those people, I think, are in all cases absolute, I think the industry term is shitbags.

272
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:26,789
Speaker 0: Yeah.

273
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:30,780
Speaker 1: Like, anyone who is mad about this is a bad person.

274
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,840
Speaker 1: There is no purity to Scrabble as a sport in this regard.

275
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,800
Speaker 1: Removing those words does not materially impact the game in any way.

276
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:40,057
Speaker 0: It just makes it better.

277
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,720
Speaker 0: If you wanted to make, if you think about it, Scrabble is like a memorization game, right?

278
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:52,859
Speaker 0: If you think about the Scrabble dictionary, they don't let you have it with you when you play, which maybe they should, it might be more interesting.

279
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:00,260
Speaker 0: But it's like, of all the different mahjong types, old Jewish lady mahjong, the one my mom plays, right?

280
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,260
Speaker 0: There's a mahjong card that comes out every once in a while that has all the hands that you can score, right?

281
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:24,360
Speaker 0: So, if you think about it, to keep changing that card, to keep things interesting, Scrabble actually, I think, would be very well served by just changing up its dictionary, not even for a very good reason like this, but simply shake things up, make it more interesting.

282
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,856
Speaker 0: It's like, all right, guys, AI is a word, now it's not.

283
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,879
Speaker 0: Now it's just an abbreviation of artificial intelligence, can't use it, no acronyms, right?

284
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,800
Speaker 0: Just shake things up every once in a while, keep things interesting, right?

285
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,360
Speaker 0: Probably every year, different dictionary, just because, who cares?

286
00:25:40,502 --> 00:25:43,920
Speaker 0: This year, proper nouns okay, next year, no proper nouns, whatever.

287
00:25:45,601 --> 00:26:02,200
Speaker 1: The trouble with that would be that players probably could not memorize those changes, and the game would be a radically different game and probably end up being a lot less about area control and tile management on the board.

288
00:26:02,622 --> 00:26:06,540
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, it's good to spice things up in a game that has gotten very stale.

289
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,680
Speaker 1: Oh, but I would say that separately, the Scrabble community seems pretty solid and fine with playing Scrabble as is.

290
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:18,680
Speaker 1: So really, the most important change here is they just remove these words.

291
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:32,912
Speaker 1: And the best part is, anyone who says this will affect their gameplay, that means either they willfully will want to play words that are clearly racial slurs, and will say, "Oh, I didn't know that was a slur.

292
00:26:32,932 --> 00:26:34,178
Speaker 1: How was I supposed to know that was a

293
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:34,379
Speaker 1: slur?".

294
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:51,300
Speaker 1: Anyone who has trouble playing Scrabble effectively, now that these 400 words have been removed out of the I don't actually know how big the Scrabble dictionary is, but orders of magnitude more than 400 words, anyone for whom this affects their strategy is just a racist.

295
00:26:52,341 --> 00:27:03,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, this is somebody who those words stand out to them when they look at... There are certain ones that are going to stand out to, I think, people with vocabularies, right?

296
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,011
Speaker 0: But there are other ones that, like, 400 words, if I was willing to say racial slurs...

297
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,910
Speaker 1: Could I list 400 racial slurs?

298
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,080
Speaker 0: I could have come up with more than, like, not that many, right?

299
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,860
Speaker 0: So if these are standing out to you, you've memorized them.

300
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:23,160
Speaker 0: You look at a random arrangement of tiles of which any number of words could appear.

301
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:24,712
Speaker 1: And you're like, "Ha ha!

302
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:25,239
Speaker 0: That

303
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:25,360
Speaker 0: one!".

304
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,820
Speaker 0: Just some random letters of the alphabet.

305
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,839
Speaker 0: And if the racial slurs are the ones that stand out to you and are worth a lot of points in your brain, what does that say about your brain?

306
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:39,680
Speaker 1: In another big news from yesterday, what's going on with this week?

307
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,018
Speaker 1: Remember we talked about how PlayStation was shutting down the PS Vita and PS3 stores?

308
00:27:44,982 --> 00:27:46,789
Speaker 1: They actually reversed that decision.

309
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:49,840
Speaker 1: The stores will continue operation for the foreseeable future.

310
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,033
Speaker 0: Very good!

311
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,179
Speaker 1: They issued a really good statement about it.

312
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,400
Speaker 1: I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it's short.

313
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,780
Speaker 1: But basically, upon further reflection, it's clear that we made the wrong decision here.

314
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:02,239
Speaker 1: We're happy to say we'll be keeping the store operational.

315
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,296
Speaker 1: PSP commerce functionality will retire on July 2nd, 2021 is planned.

316
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:13,360
Speaker 1: So they're going to shut down the PSP commerce stuff, but the games will remain online until they decide what to do.

317
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:15,920
Speaker 0: That's exactly what they should do, right?

318
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:20,200
Speaker 0: See, I think that that's what Nintendo also should have done, even for the Wii store.

319
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:28,200
Speaker 0: It's like, look, operating a store means you have to keep updating it, security updates, money's coming in.

320
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,598
Speaker 0: It's a big pain in the ass, right?

321
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:42,340
Speaker 0: But people who bought games or bought software from you, all you have to do is maintain the ability for people to re-download software they've already purchased.

322
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:54,920
Speaker 0: If somebody on the Wii, you know, it's gone now, but let's say someone bought a game on the Wii eShop, it's like, okay, if someone buys a brand new Wii today, they never had one before, they get a used one and set it up.

323
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:58,080
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, guess what, you can't buy any digital games anymore.

324
00:28:58,622 --> 00:28:59,279
Speaker 0: Store's closed.

325
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,720
Speaker 0: But if you bought games back in the day, like me, for your Wii, you should be able to download them.

326
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:05,600
Speaker 0: Even Apple.

327
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:27,119
Speaker 0: If you have an Apple iPhone or any iOS device, and probably also the App Store that's on Macs and whatnot, I have never used that, so I don't know, but there were games and other software that I bought for the iPhone 3G in 2008 or whenever, when that thing came out, because the day the iPhone 3G came out is the day the App Store came out.

328
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:37,449
Speaker 0: There were software that I bought on that day, and that software has not been updated, the developers are gone, you can't buy it in the App Store anymore, right?

329
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,819
Speaker 0: It probably won't even work on the newest iOS, right?

330
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:46,700
Speaker 0: But there is a section hidden in the App Store app, even on my iPhone now.

331
00:29:47,141 --> 00:30:05,820
Speaker 0: I can go into the iPhone 12, I can go into the App Store app, and I can go to the purchased section, and every app I've ever purchased is in there, and I can download them and try to run them, even if the developers are gone, or you can't buy them right, and that's what they should be doing on these other app stores, right?

332
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:09,880
Speaker 0: Just keep the downloads up, so that people who've already bought can download.

333
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:44,260
Speaker 1: Well, the other thing, especially for games where preservation is something, we do need at some point some sort of regulations and laws that basically say if a game requires these online services or whatever, like, either the company has to provide some archival method for museums, researchers, libraries, people who bought them in the past to be able to get them and run them without those services, or if that's to owners of a burden, like a tiny store or something, and the company fails to provide that, it should be legal to hack, pirate, or otherwise acquire those games, or do work on them to make them interoperable and still playable.

334
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:56,880
Speaker 0: I think there could be crafted some sort of legislation that says any digital device that has any sort of storage, right?

335
00:30:58,843 --> 00:31:00,128
Speaker 0: Even if it's a ROM, right?

336
00:31:01,272 --> 00:31:03,280
Speaker 0: Usually you'd be thinking about read/write storage, right?

337
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,452
Speaker 0: So if you make a device, let's say you make a toaster, right?

338
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:18,040
Speaker 0: And the toaster has a one-megabyte flash memory chip in there that has the software for the toaster that's on there.

339
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:20,807
Speaker 0: It's not even writable.

340
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:23,517
Speaker 0: It's read-only, or maybe you can flash the firmware or something.

341
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:24,480
Speaker 0: It's, you know, whatever.

342
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:35,540
Speaker 0: There should be a law that's like, hey, if you have a device with storage, there must be some user-accessible way to read the bits out of that storage.

343
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:44,580
Speaker 1: Specifically to be able to run that software somewhere else if certain conditions are met such that it's no longer supported by the company or the rights holders.

344
00:31:45,121 --> 00:31:46,263
Speaker 0: So I open the toaster.

345
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:57,000
Speaker 0: There should be some sort of connector where I can connect like USB and mount the, you know, just some sort of, you know, even if it's really arduous to use it, it needs to exist.

346
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:05,260
Speaker 0: Some user-accessible or even just a documented way for whatever software is in there to be, you know, backed up by people.

347
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:24,440
Speaker 0: So if it would apply to an app store, it's like, yeah, if you have a PS Vita and people buy and software gets downloaded or whatever, there needs to be some way on the PS Vita device for users to be able to access those files that they just downloaded to copy them somewhere, you know?

348
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:25,121
Speaker 1: Yep.

349
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:35,640
Speaker 1: In some other minor news, Nintendo, Labo, the cardboard thing that was pretty cool, Nintendo removed the dedicated site for Labo a little while ago.

350
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:45,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, so on the one hand, you know, Labo is obviously not doing, Labo is the one time in my life that I bought extra of a thing thinking, hey, this is going to sell out everywhere.

351
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:53,180
Speaker 0: And so I bought, when Labo first came out, I bought two of each and I ended up giving two away.

352
00:32:53,962 --> 00:32:56,298
Speaker 1: I mean, it was a moderately cool toy, but it wasn't...

353
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,041
Speaker 0: It's fun.

354
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:57,482
Speaker 0: Yeah.

355
00:32:57,582 --> 00:32:59,706
Speaker 0: I didn't use, I saw the two that I still have.

356
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:00,627
Speaker 0: I didn't use them all yet.

357
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:01,729
Speaker 0: I still have some.

358
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:07,400
Speaker 0: I didn't build everything yet, but yeah, it's still cool, but it did not do, it did not perform well.

359
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,260
Speaker 0: And they didn't, they continued to release, I think one or more set maybe, maybe two, but...

360
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,046
Speaker 1: So from what I read, Nintendo won't say anything.

361
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:19,960
Speaker 1: They're like, they basically said, oh, don't read anything into the fact that we got rid of the dedicated page for Labo.

362
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,140
Speaker 0: Yeah.

363
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,984
Speaker 0: They were like, we're reorganizing our websites.

364
00:33:22,024 --> 00:33:23,086
Speaker 0: We do that once in a while.

365
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:25,471
Speaker 0: You can find out about Labo at Nintendo.com.

366
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:27,615
Speaker 0: There's still Labo pages on Nintendo.com.

367
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:29,980
Speaker 0: We just don't have a dedicated Labo page anymore.

368
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,580
Speaker 1: Yup.

369
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:40,534
Speaker 1: There is a credible rumor that there's going to be basically one more Labo announcement and then Labo is actually done.

370
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:44,620
Speaker 1: And Nintendo didn't think people would notice that they removed the website.

371
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:46,001
Speaker 0: Sure.

372
00:33:47,506 --> 00:33:51,740
Speaker 0: On the one hand, yes, I do think Labo is kind of done because it isn't selling that well.

373
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,874
Speaker 1: Even from the beginning, they only sold about a million from what I'm reading.

374
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:56,120
Speaker 1: It did not sell.

375
00:33:57,721 --> 00:34:02,506
Speaker 0: But at the same time, yes, not in this instance, but there are a lot of instances.

376
00:34:02,586 --> 00:34:06,410
Speaker 0: I think people read way too much into.

377
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,371
Speaker 0: someone took a website down.

378
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:16,179
Speaker 0: So-and-so liked someone else's tweet or someone likes someone's celebrity A likes celebrity B thing on Instagram.

379
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,781
Speaker 0: Someone unfollowed someone.

380
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:26,826
Speaker 0: Ooh, that means they're going to, you know, someone changed their profile on their social media account.

381
00:34:26,846 --> 00:34:28,447
Speaker 0: That means they're quitting their job.

382
00:34:28,868 --> 00:34:29,168
Speaker 0: Right.

383
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,510
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, why are they?

384
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:34,013
Speaker 0: someone in a band took the name of the band out of their profile.

385
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:35,234
Speaker 0: It means they're breaking up.

386
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:35,594
Speaker 0: Right.

387
00:34:35,635 --> 00:34:36,856
Speaker 0: It's like, well, you know what that is.

388
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:41,260
Speaker 1: That is one piece of data that can be used with a preponderance of other data.

389
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:48,210
Speaker 0: I'm not saying and I'm not saying it's, you know, that means it's your it's wrong, but I'm just saying don't jump fully to the conclusion.

390
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:48,732
Speaker 0: True.

391
00:34:48,772 --> 00:34:49,092
Speaker 0: Right.

392
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:52,138
Speaker 0: Just based on that thing, it's just like, you know, it's.

393
00:34:52,518 --> 00:34:53,580
Speaker 0: you could think of it as like a hint.

394
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:58,148
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, some, you know, someone did, you know, think to do that.

395
00:34:58,248 --> 00:34:59,129
Speaker 0: So maybe.

396
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,553
Speaker 0: But don't just be like, oh, that's it.

397
00:35:01,654 --> 00:35:05,460
Speaker 0: That Nintendo's canceling Labo because it's like, oh, maybe.

398
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:15,272
Speaker 1: So with Nintendo specifically that I have a. I have this just feeling based on the history of Nintendo and all the times this kind of thing happens.

399
00:35:16,774 --> 00:35:20,258
Speaker 1: when that kind of thing happens in Nintendo, it pretty much always means the thing is dead.

400
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,480
Speaker 0: Probably.

401
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:21,580
Speaker 1: Yeah.

402
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,280
Speaker 1: Like Nintendo.

403
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,721
Speaker 0: I mean, I would I bet you can do.

404
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:27,004
Speaker 0: you could have convinced me Labo is dead without the website changing.

405
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:27,184
Speaker 0: Yeah.

406
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:30,246
Speaker 1: And last, a little tiny thing.

407
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:31,487
Speaker 0: Railroad Inc.

408
00:35:31,747 --> 00:35:33,728
Speaker 1: is a super cute roll and write game.

409
00:35:34,629 --> 00:35:36,050
Speaker 0: We've talked about it on the show before.

410
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,071
Speaker 1: I think we reviewed it.

411
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,552
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if we did or not, actually.

412
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:40,813
Speaker 0: Maybe it's part of our show on rolling rights.

413
00:35:41,134 --> 00:35:44,596
Speaker 1: We might have talked about it in a general because there there's so many of them and they're so good.

414
00:35:44,616 --> 00:35:46,097
Speaker 0: But they did do a show on rolling rights.

415
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:46,337
Speaker 0: Yeah.

416
00:35:46,597 --> 00:35:47,258
Speaker 0: Railroad Inc.

417
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:50,160
Speaker 1: is coming out this summer on scene.

418
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:51,960
Speaker 0: Hooray.

419
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:56,185
Speaker 0: I'm excited about that because there aren't a lot of digital rolling rights going around.

420
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:56,885
Speaker 0: Exactly.

421
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:57,987
Speaker 1: And it's coming out summer.

422
00:35:58,107 --> 00:36:06,695
Speaker 1: So this will be another game we can play online with friends before Covid calms down and there's a chance for us to start to enter a post Covid world and see people in person someday.

423
00:36:08,057 --> 00:36:10,639
Speaker 0: Plus that route expansion for digital is coming.

424
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:11,360
Speaker 1: Oh, in like a week.

425
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,643
Speaker 0: Imminently.

426
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:16,340
Speaker 0: We're going to be playing a lot of online route as soon as that hits.

427
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,128
Speaker 0: I call otters.

428
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:17,860
Speaker 1: First game we play.

429
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,200
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't really even care if I am the otters.

430
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,160
Speaker 1: I just want the otters there.

431
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,261
Speaker 0: Yeah.

432
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:29,096
Speaker 0: It's like I'm happy to just continue to be a vagabond or a communist or cat or even right.

433
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:30,520
Speaker 0: It's like it's just not bird, obviously.

434
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,253
Speaker 0: I just want other.

435
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,646
Speaker 1: I think you have the record for most.

436
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,639
Speaker 1: Collapse governments as the birds in a single game.

437
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:47,320
Speaker 0: I'm really not good with birds, but, you know, I just like I just want the other, you know, to be there to mix things up.

438
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,940
Speaker 0: It's really gets a little bit stale with the same factions over and over.

439
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,515
Speaker 1: It's funny how like I'm not I'm not going to claim I'm like great at route or anything like.

440
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:55,600
Speaker 1: I don't win that often.

441
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,979
Speaker 1: But weirdly with the birds, it's like Voldo with me.

442
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,920
Speaker 1: Like I'm just like the birds are my Voldo in route.

443
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,569
Speaker 1: Like I'm just weirdly good at them in a way.

444
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,280
Speaker 1: that is I can't even explain exactly what I mean.

445
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,500
Speaker 0: You somehow I think it's obvious that if you're birds and you don't turmoil ever.

446
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,081
Speaker 0: Right.

447
00:37:12,101 --> 00:37:13,660
Speaker 0: You're going to you're going to do really well.

448
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,780
Speaker 0: And you just somehow you find a way to never turmoil or maybe turmoil one time.

449
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,060
Speaker 1: And that's well, the turmoil on on a particular turn on purpose is like the galaxy brain strategy with the birds.

450
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:29,780
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, if you're going to have to do the one turmoil, you want to do it at the right moment.

451
00:37:30,321 --> 00:37:32,253
Speaker 1: But yeah, my strategy is never turmoil.

452
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,460
Speaker 1: Why would you ever turmoil?

453
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,760
Speaker 0: I agree with that strategy.

454
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,780
Speaker 0: I'm just very bad at seeing the lines to execute it, even though I want to do it every time.

455
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,500
Speaker 1: Somehow I'll pull it off, except that one time when Friend of the Foxes came out, I did not expect that.

456
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,220
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

457
00:37:53,580 --> 00:38:00,520
Speaker 1: So this video is titled Guy Plays Dead After Goose Bites Him To See What He Would Do.

458
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,257
Speaker 1: And it's a video where apparently this person knows there's a goose that he knows, like.

459
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:07,240
Speaker 1: he has a name for this goose.

460
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,045
Speaker 1: And the goose knows him.

461
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,140
Speaker 1: I get the impression the goose likes to bite.

462
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:15,080
Speaker 1: So it's a short video where he's like, he's going to do that.

463
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,139
Speaker 1: They do hiss and then bite.

464
00:38:18,582 --> 00:38:21,760
Speaker 1: So he's like, all right, I'm going to get the goose to come over.

465
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:28,500
Speaker 1: If the goose bites me, I'm going to fall over and play dead, like see what the goose does if the goose wins the fight.

466
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,459
Speaker 1: And I did not expect how this video is going to end.

467
00:38:32,982 --> 00:38:35,320
Speaker 1: And all I'm going to say is it's not even three minutes long.

468
00:38:35,902 --> 00:38:39,780
Speaker 1: The payoff at the end of this video is above and beyond what you will be expecting.

469
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,800
Speaker 1: It is delightful.

470
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,778
Speaker 0: OK, I'll have to watch this.

471
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,260
Speaker 1: It's pretty good, especially because you'll see I don't want to spoil it.

472
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,220
Speaker 1: I was I was surprised by this ending.

473
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:50,579
Speaker 1: This is not the best thing that I've ever had.

474
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,260
Speaker 1: Like, don't don't think I'm I don't want to overhype this, but the ending is appropriate.

475
00:38:57,143 --> 00:38:57,364
Speaker 0: All right.

476
00:38:57,404 --> 00:39:00,600
Speaker 0: So I don't know how many people are familiar with the craft of needle felting.

477
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,317
Speaker 0: It's basically you can basically make anything out of just like little bits of wool.

478
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:05,283
Speaker 0: Right.

479
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:07,560
Speaker 0: You sort of, you know, I don't know exactly how you do it.

480
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,440
Speaker 0: I usually see at artist's alley, people have made cute things out of needle felt usually.

481
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:11,742
Speaker 0: Right.

482
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,320
Speaker 0: You know, you can make basically anything.

483
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,500
Speaker 0: It's almost like using wool instead of clay is the way I think about it.

484
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:27,740
Speaker 0: But anyway, this is YouTube channel, which is my thing of the day that only has six point sixty seven thousand subscribers, which is nowhere near enough.

485
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:31,300
Speaker 0: And it's called Andrea Love.

486
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,940
Speaker 0: I assume that's the person's name who's running the channel.

487
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:45,560
Speaker 0: And this person uploaded a video 10 years ago, a video six years ago, and then starting one year ago, which I'm going to assume is pandemic related.

488
00:39:46,923 --> 00:39:49,880
Speaker 0: They became very active on YouTube, posting their third video.

489
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:59,720
Speaker 0: And then one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 more videos within the year, one of them five days ago, another one 11 hours ago.

490
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,022
Speaker 0: Right.

491
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:03,420
Speaker 0: So this person is in the past year become very active on YouTube.

492
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,600
Speaker 0: And their thing is they're really fucking good at needle felting.

493
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:17,620
Speaker 0: And what they do is they basically use needle felting to do animation, basically the way you would do claymation only with needle felt, you know, stop motion.

494
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,000
Speaker 0: Right.

495
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:25,700
Speaker 0: And the videos that they have made are mostly the best series that they've done is the cooking with wool.

496
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:27,320
Speaker 1: Oh, those look real good.

497
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:33,920
Speaker 0: They've made this little wool kitchen and in the wool kitchen, they'll cook wool food.

498
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,179
Speaker 0: And the only hand is like their big human hand coming in.

499
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:38,081
Speaker 0: Right.

500
00:40:38,823 --> 00:40:47,019
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, the things that they have crafted, like they do smoke and steam and cutting, cutting objects.

501
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,800
Speaker 0: And, you know, they made a cake and they cut the cake.

502
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,160
Speaker 0: It's just like things go in the oven.

503
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:58,360
Speaker 0: It's like really the attention to detail and the high level of craftsmanship.

504
00:40:58,902 --> 00:41:02,160
Speaker 0: Like any one of these videos is like a plus thing of the day.

505
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:03,819
Speaker 0: And there's a whole channel full of them.

506
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:06,440
Speaker 0: The one they did today is digital wool drawing.

507
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:08,979
Speaker 0: It looks like they basically recreated a Photoshop with wool.

508
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,239
Speaker 0: It's like, holy shit.

509
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:13,360
Speaker 0: Someone drawing on an iPad made it a wall.

510
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:15,518
Speaker 0: You'll understand once you see it.

511
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:17,180
Speaker 0: This is fantastic.

512
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:20,599
Speaker 0: And this needs at least 100 times more subscribers than it has.

513
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:21,980
Speaker 1: I just subscribed.

514
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:26,600
Speaker 1: In the meta moment.

515
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:30,200
Speaker 1: So my reading of Genji slowed down a little bit.

516
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,379
Speaker 1: I was busy all week.

517
00:41:31,984 --> 00:41:32,659
Speaker 0: You don't say.

518
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:36,379
Speaker 1: I think it'll pick up this weekend because it is real nice and warm out now.

519
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,780
Speaker 1: And sitting in a park and reading has been my like plan coming out of winter for a long time.

520
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,519
Speaker 1: And I'm feeling it so hard that I suspect in by this weekend, I'm going to accelerate again.

521
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:50,960
Speaker 1: Otherwise, our stuff's all online.

522
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:51,858
Speaker 1: Like, go check it out.

523
00:41:52,321 --> 00:41:56,960
Speaker 1: I dug up and I'll link to him the handful of gig nights merch stuff that's out there.

524
00:41:57,342 --> 00:41:58,880
Speaker 1: A lot of it still uses our old logo.

525
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,381
Speaker 1: And I'm going to.

526
00:41:59,401 --> 00:42:08,700
Speaker 1: I'm working on a project to replace the old gig night shirts that are available on Amazon with newer ones that have the new logo and are updated in some fashions.

527
00:42:09,262 --> 00:42:11,120
Speaker 1: But I did actually stick up as a test.

528
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,820
Speaker 1: The first new thing that uses our new branding.

529
00:42:14,322 --> 00:42:17,920
Speaker 1: There is a gig night's popsocket if you want to buy it on Amazon.

530
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:23,740
Speaker 1: It cost me 10 minutes of futzing in Photoshop to get the template to work.

531
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,080
Speaker 0: I never understood the popsocket.

532
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:27,320
Speaker 1: I did not like pop sockets.

533
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,780
Speaker 0: I tried one once.

534
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,980
Speaker 0: People, you know, I looked at it and I said, that's silly.

535
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,000
Speaker 0: Why do you need that for?

536
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,540
Speaker 0: I've never had a problem holding my phone.

537
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,280
Speaker 1: Well, because you have a normal sized phone, not these gigantic ones.

538
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:36,931
Speaker 1: These kids are buying.

539
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,640
Speaker 0: People were like, you know, my coworkers like, oh, no, you got to try it.

540
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,655
Speaker 0: I was skeptical, too.

541
00:42:41,777 --> 00:42:41,960
Speaker 0: Right.

542
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:45,820
Speaker 0: So our company, my previous company, actually gave everyone pop sockets at one point.

543
00:42:46,283 --> 00:42:47,980
Speaker 0: So I stuck it on my phone and I tried it out.

544
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,599
Speaker 0: And I was like, I didn't.

545
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,299
Speaker 0: I had it on there for like a week.

546
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:53,139
Speaker 0: And I was like, that's enough of that.

547
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:54,340
Speaker 0: This is annoying.

548
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,560
Speaker 1: It's actually harder to hold my phone with this than just holding it in my hand.

549
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:58,791
Speaker 0: Yeah.

550
00:42:59,422 --> 00:43:01,520
Speaker 0: But if you're maybe, you know, you're someone who needs one.

551
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,079
Speaker 0: Why not a gig night's one?

552
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,600
Speaker 0: Because there's probably a better, cooler one you could get.

553
00:43:06,742 --> 00:43:07,880
Speaker 0: And probably not from Amazon.

554
00:43:08,142 --> 00:43:09,980
Speaker 0: Maybe like an artist made one or something cool.

555
00:43:10,103 --> 00:43:10,698
Speaker 0: Get that instead.

556
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,117
Speaker 0: Yeah.

557
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:16,200
Speaker 1: But I figure if we're going to have a presence there, I'll at least put our basic as merch out there.

558
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,240
Speaker 1: I think we get like a dollar if you buy one.

559
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,000
Speaker 1: Don't think buying that will send us a lot of money.

560
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,959
Speaker 0: Pop socket is even worth a dollar.

561
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:23,616
Speaker 0: They're free.

562
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:25,900
Speaker 0: Maybe we should buy a bunch.

563
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,900
Speaker 0: Just hand them out, I guess.

564
00:43:28,503 --> 00:43:31,819
Speaker 1: I can order these in bulk to give away as trinkets and such pretty easily, too.

565
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:32,728
Speaker 0: Yeah.

566
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:35,900
Speaker 1: I'm going with the low effort shop for now.

567
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:36,738
Speaker 1: All right.

568
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:37,560
Speaker 1: Let's get right into it.

569
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,120
Speaker 1: Let's review the show because I'm getting hungry.

570
00:43:39,426 --> 00:43:40,040
Speaker 1: I haven't eaten yet.

571
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,259
Speaker 1: And there's important hockey.

572
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,076
Speaker 0: I ate before the show.

573
00:43:43,862 --> 00:43:44,319
Speaker 1: All right.

574
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:44,965
Speaker 1: So Pac-Man 99 is...

575
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,700
Speaker 0: Well, before you got to talk about Pac-Man 99, we got to talk about Tetris 99.

576
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,760
Speaker 1: Which I never actually played.

577
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:52,501
Speaker 0: Oh, you never played Tetris 99?

578
00:43:52,501 --> 00:43:53,460
Speaker 1: No, I know the deal with it.

579
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,939
Speaker 1: I just literally never played it.

580
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:17,419
Speaker 0: So Nintendo, you know, to get people to use Nintendo online has been, you know, making actually, you know, some interesting, you know, multiplayer games and other things that you just get for having Nintendo online, which almost make it worth, you know, paying the $20 a year instead of just getting the ability to play Nintendo games online, which would not be worth any money whatsoever, considering how poor of an experience it is.

581
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:25,840
Speaker 0: But, you know, among the things they're giving out for free to people who have Nintendo online on their Switch are some of these interesting multiplayer experiences.

582
00:44:26,482 --> 00:44:32,780
Speaker 0: It began with Tetris 99, then for a period, I believe it's gone now because the Mario anniversary celebration's over.

583
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,648
Speaker 0: There was the Mario 35, whatever.

584
00:44:35,582 --> 00:44:37,800
Speaker 0: And now there is Pac-Man 99.

585
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:49,020
Speaker 0: So the deal is, is it's basically they're taking the sort of PUBG, you know, elimination model and applying it to more traditional old school games.

586
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:52,220
Speaker 0: So Tetris 99 is like, "Hey, you're going to play Tetris.

587
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,439
Speaker 0: 99 other people are going to be playing Tetris at the same time.

588
00:44:56,361 --> 00:45:00,178
Speaker 0: When you complete, you know, lines, you do damage to other people,

589
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:00,419
Speaker 0: right?".

590
00:45:01,262 --> 00:45:03,260
Speaker 0: You're going to choose who you're going to damage.

591
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,799
Speaker 0: So you, you know, there's four choices of like who you're going to send your lines to.

592
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,440
Speaker 0: It's not just sending them to everybody.

593
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:15,472
Speaker 0: We would all die instantly if we all received 99 people sending lines to us on our Tetris boards, right, that aren't 99 lines tall.

594
00:45:17,941 --> 00:45:22,318
Speaker 0: And you just play Tetris and you try to see if you can be the last one alive and not die.

595
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,540
Speaker 0: And it's like, that's a really, really good concept.

596
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:26,960
Speaker 0: It's executed really well.

597
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:27,899
Speaker 0: You can still play it.

598
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,558
Speaker 0: It's really fun.

599
00:45:29,942 --> 00:45:37,243
Speaker 0: The thing is Tetris is a game where it's natural to have this sort of push towards elimination, right?

600
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,038
Speaker 0: It gets faster, first of all, which kills people with don't have enough skill to play fast Tetris.

601
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:50,060
Speaker 0: But even if it doesn't get faster, right, if people are pushing lines on you, you're going to die eventually.

602
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:56,800
Speaker 1: You got to keep the line parity with them, meaning you got to be working at least as fast as they're working or you're going to get overwhelmed eventually.

603
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:56,902
Speaker 1: Yep.

604
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,020
Speaker 0: There is a natural push to elimination in Tetris.

605
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:04,100
Speaker 0: It doesn't need much modification to become this elimination game.

606
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,801
Speaker 0: So they said Pac-Man 99.

607
00:46:06,801 --> 00:46:09,340
Speaker 0: It's like, Ooh, I like a, I like a Pac-Man.

608
00:46:09,608 --> 00:46:09,858
Speaker 0: Right.

609
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:19,580
Speaker 0: But Pac-Man doesn't have, you know, this multiplayer, you know, there's never been a thing where you damage other people who are also playing Pac-Man.

610
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,092
Speaker 0: Right.

611
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:25,480
Speaker 0: And you're not going to be on the same board eating each other like Pac-Man battle royale or Pac-Man versus.

612
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:25,583
Speaker 0: Yep.

613
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:31,120
Speaker 0: It's 99 people each individually playing normal old Pac-Man.

614
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,780
Speaker 0: So how the hell is it going to work?

615
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,140
Speaker 0: What will be the pressure?

616
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,040
Speaker 0: Because there could be two people who are so good at Pac-Man, they can play it forever.

617
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,419
Speaker 0: Who's going to be eliminated?

618
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,440
Speaker 1: Well, like that Duck Hunt tournament where you and me and our friend Katsu were literally just, we could go forever.

619
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,046
Speaker 1: There's no point.

620
00:46:45,066 --> 00:46:46,099
Speaker 1: we're going to miss a discus.

621
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:49,480
Speaker 0: See the Geek Nights panel ending ends of games.

622
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:53,540
Speaker 0: You need some sort of pressure to push towards the end of the game.

623
00:46:53,701 --> 00:46:55,900
Speaker 0: So a good ending condition.

624
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,940
Speaker 0: So you need an elimination condition.

625
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:04,180
Speaker 0: Obviously, if you have a, you know, elimination type PUBG game, people need some way to die.

626
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,318
Speaker 0: You know, we playing Pac-Man, some people might just die on their own, but you need something else.

627
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:13,880
Speaker 0: So what they did is they added two spicy things to the game, right?

628
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,180
Speaker 0: The first thing is, you know, you eat a power pellet and you eat some ghosts.

629
00:47:19,282 --> 00:47:23,700
Speaker 0: And when you eat the ghosts, you're going to choose who you attack, just like you do in Tetris 99.

630
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:23,780
Speaker 0: Yup.

631
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,400
Speaker 0: And you're going to send what's known as Jammer Pac-Men to the other board.

632
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,340
Speaker 0: And what the Jammer Pac-Men are is basically little outlines of Pac-Men and they move around.

633
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:36,940
Speaker 1: They don't kill you, but they slow you down if you run through them.

634
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:37,440
Speaker 0: They slow you down.

635
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:49,180
Speaker 0: So if your board fills up with a whole bunch of them, that could spell doom for you because it'll help the ghosts catch you and kill you because you'll be stuck in the sea of Jammer Pac-Men moving at like one pixel a second, right?

636
00:47:49,924 --> 00:47:52,760
Speaker 0: And if you touch a power pellet, all the Jammer Pac-Men go away.

637
00:47:55,321 --> 00:48:06,700
Speaker 0: The second thing they added was that once the game gets down to only 50 people playing, they start to add, I forget what the name for them is, but they're raising even more something like that.

638
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:07,800
Speaker 1: I think they're just called Red Jammers.

639
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,539
Speaker 1: There's Red Pac-Men that'll show up.

640
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:14,740
Speaker 1: Not only do they kill you if you touch them, but power pellets do not let you eat them.

641
00:48:15,702 --> 00:48:18,920
Speaker 0: No, power pellets will, they're basically red outlines of Pac-Men.

642
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:21,380
Speaker 0: If you eat a power pellet, they'll stop moving.

643
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,779
Speaker 0: They'll be frozen in place.

644
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:26,980
Speaker 0: But if you didn't eat a power pellet, they'll chase you and they are instant death.

645
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,080
Speaker 0: You cannot eat them like you can eat a ghost.

646
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:34,778
Speaker 0: They are, you know, so if your board fills with these guys, you are getting very close to losing the game.

647
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:42,220
Speaker 0: And if the other person is doing well and eating lots of ghosts, your board will fill with them and that will pressure you into losing, right?

648
00:48:44,082 --> 00:48:46,280
Speaker 0: So how do you do more damage?

649
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,860
Speaker 0: So they've added something from Pac-Man CEDX, right?

650
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,380
Speaker 0: The sleeping sort of ghost trains.

651
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, the ghost train.

652
00:48:54,762 --> 00:48:55,931
Speaker 1: So it becomes a game of.

653
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:57,120
Speaker 1: you can get big combos.

654
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,739
Speaker 1: You can basically pick up these sleeping ghosts who will follow a real ghost and then you can eat a lot of ghosts at once.

655
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:07,959
Speaker 1: And the longer you keep that combo going, the more and more damage you're sending out to other players.

656
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:08,932
Speaker 0: Yep.

657
00:49:09,342 --> 00:49:10,820
Speaker 0: Just like Pac-Man CE, right?

658
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:11,352
Speaker 0: CEDX.

659
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,320
Speaker 0: You can get the sleeping ghosts and then they fill up, right?

660
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:22,780
Speaker 0: The final thing, which they also took from CEDX or CE, whatever, is that, you know, you sort of, these quadrants of the board, right?

661
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:28,360
Speaker 0: So when the board loads, you never know if one, two, zero, one, two, three or four quadrants will be full of pellets.

662
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:34,080
Speaker 0: If you eat all the pellets that are on the board, your speed will go up by one.

663
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:40,596
Speaker 0: That's real important to clear the board to get your speed up because that's what's going to help you survive when the game gets dangerous.

664
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:47,580
Speaker 1: It's a little complicated because they added this, there's an option where you can choose basically what to upgrade, like what to boost.

665
00:49:47,642 --> 00:49:48,057
Speaker 0: Well, no, no, no.

666
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,900
Speaker 0: So that's a little different, right?

667
00:49:50,361 --> 00:49:54,600
Speaker 0: So if you clear the board of regular pellets, you get a permanent speed boost, right?

668
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,059
Speaker 0: Your speed just goes up by one.

669
00:49:57,501 --> 00:50:04,219
Speaker 0: And then if you eat the fruit, the fruit will appear in its normal spot if half the board is cleared.

670
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,199
Speaker 1: There's some debate as to whether or not it's actually half.

671
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:08,500
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

672
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,493
Speaker 1: Looks like it's roughly 75% of the pellets that are.

673
00:50:11,534 --> 00:50:12,578
Speaker 1: there seems to be the number.

674
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:13,860
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

675
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,780
Speaker 0: But anyway, the fruit will appear.

676
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:20,040
Speaker 1: I love Reddit thread where basically Nintendo didn't actually explain the details of how these mechanics work.

677
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,179
Speaker 0: They didn't explain shit.

678
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,200
Speaker 0: The whole internet is like trying to figure it out.

679
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:29,600
Speaker 1: So there's a Reddit thread where people are constantly figuring out like the details of how this works and getting it wrong.

680
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:31,513
Speaker 1: And it's, it's kind of an annoying aside.

681
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:32,379
Speaker 1: we'll get to toward the end.

682
00:50:33,082 --> 00:50:33,171
Speaker 0: Yeah.

683
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:36,580
Speaker 0: But anyway, the fruit appears at some point.

684
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:39,660
Speaker 0: When you eat the fruits, the board resets.

685
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:45,280
Speaker 0: So if you've cleared the whole board and your speed went up, you're going to go want to go eat that fruit to get a new board, right?

686
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,439
Speaker 0: But there's another thing the fruit does is it can clear all the red jammer Pac-Man.

687
00:50:51,499 --> 00:50:52,719
Speaker 0: that's super deadly ones.

688
00:50:53,120 --> 00:51:04,620
Speaker 0: So the general strategy that I've built for this game is early on when the game is slow and there's not as a lot of players left and the red jammer Pac-Man aren't even there because they don't appear till half the players are eliminated.

689
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:07,380
Speaker 0: You want to clear your whole board to get your speed up.

690
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,880
Speaker 0: I can usually get my speed up to like three, sometimes four, right?

691
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:19,520
Speaker 0: And then once you hear the note, the sound that announces like half the players have been eliminated, now is the time to just be like, all right, fuck that.

692
00:51:20,123 --> 00:51:21,800
Speaker 0: I don't care about clearing the whole board anymore.

693
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,738
Speaker 0: Just stay alive.

694
00:51:23,143 --> 00:51:24,558
Speaker 0: And if the fruit is there, eat it.

695
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:31,380
Speaker 0: So get the fruit, eat the fruit, get the fruit, eat the fruit to keep the red guys down and to stay alive and to keep the danger level down.

696
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:33,820
Speaker 0: Don't worry about getting your speed up anymore.

697
00:51:33,922 --> 00:51:35,140
Speaker 0: It's up enough, right?

698
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,760
Speaker 0: Maybe if you get really quiet board, you can get enough, you can try to clear it.

699
00:51:39,161 --> 00:51:47,400
Speaker 1: But now this is where the game is a little complicated because Nintendo doesn't explain what these options do, not in a meaningful way, but you have to choose.

700
00:51:47,922 --> 00:51:50,700
Speaker 1: And it seems like these take effect anytime you eat a power pellet.

701
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:53,266
Speaker 1: What will happen in certain?

702
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:58,140
Speaker 1: standard, stronger speed and train are the four options.

703
00:51:58,502 --> 00:52:02,200
Speaker 1: And skilled players will be flipping between these and opportune moments.

704
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:04,780
Speaker 1: And it's not super fun to engage with this mechanic.

705
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:05,620
Speaker 1: I'm not going to lie.

706
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,560
Speaker 0: No, it's a little, it's a little bit annoying, right?

707
00:52:07,943 --> 00:52:09,259
Speaker 0: Especially since we don't understand it.

708
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,739
Speaker 1: So like standard doesn't do anything.

709
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:14,420
Speaker 0: The four options, it doesn't do anything we know.

710
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,920
Speaker 1: No, they say they've confirmed it doesn't do anything.

711
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:22,820
Speaker 1: Stronger increases the amount of jammers you send to other players per ghost you eat.

712
00:52:24,223 --> 00:52:26,411
Speaker 0: So I guess you would want to switch to stronger.

713
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:31,460
Speaker 0: right at the moment you're about to eat ghosts and then switch back to standard.

714
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,819
Speaker 1: It apparently doesn't take effect until the next power pellet you eat after you change it.

715
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,619
Speaker 0: And the downside to that one.

716
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:46,480
Speaker 0: So if you're going to eat ghosts with this power pellet because your train is full, you want to switch to stronger, eat a power pellet, then eat all the ghosts, then switch back to standard.

717
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,740
Speaker 1: The downside is your power pellets expire much faster when you're in that mode.

718
00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:56,880
Speaker 0: Right, so you want to get the ghost train close to that power pellet when you have the stronger mode set.

719
00:52:57,081 --> 00:53:02,660
Speaker 1: If you choose speed, it increases your speed but decreases the number of jammers you send.

720
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:09,200
Speaker 1: And if you pick train, it increases the number of sleeping ghosts that get activated when you pick up sleeping ghosts.

721
00:53:09,722 --> 00:53:14,140
Speaker 1: But it also spawns yellow jammers on your own board when that happens.

722
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,779
Speaker 0: Well that doesn't seem too bad.

723
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:25,280
Speaker 0: So I guess the strategy would be switch to train early, right, when you want to get a lot of ghosts going.

724
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:27,440
Speaker 0: And then flip it to stronger with a big combo.

725
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,160
Speaker 0: Eat all the ghosts to do a lot more damage.

726
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,324
Speaker 0: And then keep it on standard.

727
00:53:32,424 --> 00:53:39,060
Speaker 0: but maybe late in the game, getting the extra speed may or may not be worth it depending on the situation.

728
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:43,240
Speaker 1: But you also got to flip between who you attack.

729
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,560
Speaker 1: Random, counter, hunter, and knockout.

730
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,160
Speaker 1: The game also doesn't actually explain.

731
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:52,560
Speaker 0: Oh no, I mean who you attack doesn't matter too much.

732
00:53:53,182 --> 00:54:00,060
Speaker 0: So knockout is going to send, when you eat ghosts, it's going to send jammers to whoever is close to dying.

733
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,938
Speaker 0: However the game measures that, right?

734
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:09,420
Speaker 0: Hunter is going to send your ghosts towards the people who have gotten a lot of knockouts.

735
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:14,020
Speaker 0: So the people who are doing lots of damage and killing and finishing off lots of the opponents.

736
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:16,019
Speaker 0: Let's say Rym's got five kills.

737
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:20,660
Speaker 0: If I put on Hunter, it's probably going to make me attack Rym because Rym is dangerous.

738
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:24,340
Speaker 1: That's why the one I pick almost all the time is counter.

739
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,632
Speaker 1: It sends jammers at whoever attacked you, basically.

740
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's a good one because if someone is attacking you, whether it's for whatever their setting is.

741
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,759
Speaker 0: You don't even know what their setting is.

742
00:54:37,422 --> 00:54:41,200
Speaker 0: They could have randomly been attacking you or they could be hunting you because you got a lot of kills.

743
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,979
Speaker 0: But counter will attack the people who are attacking you.

744
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:51,380
Speaker 0: And if you kill those people, you'll have less people attacking you at least short term until new people decide to attack you.

745
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:57,500
Speaker 0: And you have counter, it'll probably let you breathe easier if you eliminate people who are on your back.

746
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:01,300
Speaker 0: And then random, it just sends them to someone at random.

747
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:05,900
Speaker 0: I don't think choosing who to attack matters too much in the early game.

748
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,038
Speaker 0: I think it really matters more in the later game.

749
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,499
Speaker 0: When you're down to just a few, like you're in the top ten.

750
00:55:12,586 --> 00:55:14,019
Speaker 0: Then it can start to matter a bit.

751
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:20,821
Speaker 0: But to pay attention to that and to see how the other people are doing, it's the same thing in Tetris 99.

752
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:24,420
Speaker 0: It feels really impossible to do while also trying to play the game.

753
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,011
Speaker 0: I just focus on staying alive in the Pac-Man.

754
00:55:28,031 --> 00:55:30,600
Speaker 0: I don't pay attention to the targeting too much.

755
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:36,500
Speaker 1: I focus on staying alive and when I think about it, if I'm making it near the end, like there's only 20ish people left.

756
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:41,960
Speaker 1: I will think about trying to do stronger, hit someone hard, but not often.

757
00:55:44,044 --> 00:55:48,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I basically just set the two settings at the start and then just play.

758
00:55:49,081 --> 00:55:53,520
Speaker 0: Get my speed up and then try to stay alive once I can't get my speed up anymore.

759
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:59,560
Speaker 1: That seems to be like those top tier players will really deal with these options that are poorly defined.

760
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,480
Speaker 1: At least for the user, for the players.

761
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,960
Speaker 1: But honestly, the game is more fun if you don't worry about too much.

762
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,800
Speaker 1: And literally just focus on getting big combos and surviving as long as possible.

763
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:27,440
Speaker 0: What I like about this and Tetris 99 and the Mario one is that it's a multiplayer experience that has none of the negative stuff that you usually can get with multiplayer games.

764
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,540
Speaker 0: You play Counter-Strike, it's like bad things happen that make you not want to play Counter-Strike.

765
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:44,409
Speaker 0: Here, even though it's multiplayer, even though you get that competition, the winning and losing against other human beings, it's just you playing Pac-Man.

766
00:56:44,429 --> 00:56:46,619
Speaker 0: There's no one on your board coming after you.

767
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:50,438
Speaker 1: And it's real quick to find a game, because a lot of people are playing it right now.

768
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:56,820
Speaker 1: And it is real quick, like if you lose, just hit A a couple times and you're almost immediately in another game.

769
00:57:00,443 --> 00:57:04,740
Speaker 0: It's just like the perfect, I guess no one can chat at you.

770
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,240
Speaker 0: There's 99 people who's going to chat at you and there isn't even a chat feature anyway.

771
00:57:09,062 --> 00:57:14,440
Speaker 1: Now watch out, the game has a bunch of DLC that you should probably just ignore.

772
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,460
Speaker 1: There's all this customizable, you can purchase downloadable custom themes.

773
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:29,201
Speaker 0: Yeah, so for free, for no money whatsoever, the free game lets you play Pac-Man 99.

774
00:57:29,201 --> 00:57:29,683
Speaker 0: And that's it.

775
00:57:30,786 --> 00:57:35,360
Speaker 0: If you pay money, there are some things you can unlock that are purely cosmetic.

776
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:37,828
Speaker 0: Your board has a different skin on it.

777
00:57:38,531 --> 00:57:39,556
Speaker 0: You can change your fruits.

778
00:57:43,345 --> 00:57:47,320
Speaker 1: You can pay two real dollars and have your game look like Tower of Draga.

779
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,062
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

780
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:50,225
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, who cares?

781
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:55,600
Speaker 0: One nice thing they did do is the DLCs, you can buy them all in a complete bundle.

782
00:57:56,121 --> 00:57:56,450
Speaker 1: It's 30 bucks.

783
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:03,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there is more than just the cosmetic stuff.

784
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:07,859
Speaker 0: There is basically the modes where you can play on your own.

785
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:10,439
Speaker 0: There are other play modes.

786
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:16,116
Speaker 1: Password match, score attack, blind time attack, eight Pac-Man arrangements, 20 custom themes.

787
00:58:16,156 --> 00:58:17,220
Speaker 1: is what you get if you pay for that.

788
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:23,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the 20 custom themes are purely cosmetic, but the rest of it is actually like other modes.

789
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:30,860
Speaker 0: So if you really like this game, maybe it's worth it to buy those other modes, and you'll play more than just Pac-Man 99.

790
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:36,260
Speaker 0: You could probably get your skills up in those modes, and that'll help you play Pac-Man 99 maybe a little better.

791
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:44,819
Speaker 0: Personally, though, if I was not going to be playing that base mode of Pac-Man 99, why not just play Pac-Man CEDX?

792
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,817
Speaker 1: I was about to say, Pac-Man CEDX.

793
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,580
Speaker 0: Which is vastly superior as a single player experience.

794
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,560
Speaker 1: It's just way more tight and fun, and I get into a flow state.

795
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:58,500
Speaker 1: This game is a lot more reacting to stuff, especially once there's a lot of jammers around.

796
00:59:01,341 --> 00:59:05,520
Speaker 1: It's an okay fun game, but I'm not going to try to be competitive and serious at this.

797
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,197
Speaker 1: I doubt we'll be playing this game much a year from now.

798
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,469
Speaker 0: But there's no reason not to try it out.

799
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:18,350
Speaker 0: It's fun, it's free if you have Nintendo, if you have a Switch and you have Nintendo Online.

800
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:22,450
Speaker 1: Which, don't forget, if you have a bunch of friends, you can all make a big family plan together on that.

801
00:59:23,572 --> 00:59:25,490
Speaker 0: You can also set up private matches.

802
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,730
Speaker 0: So if you have, like, maybe, you know, it's not going to be fun with just a few people.

803
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:33,672
Speaker 0: But let's say you got 12 friends at a party and everyone has a Switch, you can play Pac-Man 12.

804
00:59:33,672 --> 00:59:35,310
Speaker 0: You don't have to play with random internet people.

805
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,389
Speaker 0: As long as you have enough people, that could be pretty fun.

806
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,230
Speaker 0: And I think everyone I know has a Switch, right?

807
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:40,890
Speaker 1: Yeah.

808
00:59:41,212 --> 00:59:45,670
Speaker 1: The thing is, what I'd much rather play is Pac-Man Versus, even though that only takes four players.

809
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,589
Speaker 1: Because that is a seriously good game.

810
00:59:48,371 --> 00:59:51,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's, like I was saying, that's more of the direct multiplayer.

811
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:53,450
Speaker 1: That could have a lot more bad feelings.

812
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:55,930
Speaker 1: This game, like you pointed out, gives a lot of ego shield.

813
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,510
Speaker 1: It's fun and you lose, but eh, whatever.

814
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,361
Speaker 1: And if you win, like, oh yeah, whatever.

815
01:00:00,462 --> 01:00:06,790
Speaker 1: Like, it's not... I don't think there are many people who are going to take this game seriously enough to get head up about it.

816
01:00:07,411 --> 01:00:07,551
Speaker 0: No.

817
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:12,547
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward to see, you know, I hope Nintendo continues this, like, '99 series.

818
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:27,589
Speaker 0: Not only would it make renewing the Nintendo Online subscription worthwhile, but also I just, you know, I've never, I don't think any of these games, like, none of the three so far have I gotten deep into.

819
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:33,447
Speaker 0: But I've played all of them enough to be like, oh, I'm maybe almost getting the money's worth of $20 a year, right?

820
01:00:35,874 --> 01:00:36,600
Speaker 0: You know, kinda.

821
01:00:37,366 --> 01:00:37,810
Speaker 0: A little bit.

822
01:00:38,397 --> 01:00:40,582
Speaker 0: I'll admit, I was... I hope they make more '99 games.

823
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:51,050
Speaker 1: I was poking at the NES and SNES emulators in there the other day, just kinda randomly, and I, uh... I'm, uh, two dungeons deep in beating Kid Icarus for real.

824
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:58,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's like, those emulators are still just like, you know, it's like, okay, they've got the best of in there, right?

825
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,906
Speaker 0: Yeah.

826
01:00:59,273 --> 01:01:00,070
Speaker 0: And some other gems.

827
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:06,730
Speaker 1: And like, you can't compete with, I can sit at my actual computer with an 8bitdo controller, and I have literally every NES game ever made.

828
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:08,269
Speaker 0: Yep.

829
01:01:08,812 --> 01:01:14,190
Speaker 1: But the convenience of, I'm sitting with my Switch, and I can just click on it, it just works for a few of these games.

830
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:16,567
Speaker 1: Sometimes I just poke at it.

831
01:01:17,334 --> 01:01:18,670
Speaker 1: But I don't think I'd pay money for that.

832
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:19,637
Speaker 0: No.

833
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:21,410
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's a thing.

834
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:26,730
Speaker 0: So, uh, Pac-Man 99, you know, nice, fun, good Pac-Man I recommend.

835
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,309
Speaker 0: I also obviously recommend Pac-Man CEDX, one of my faves.

836
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:30,639
Speaker 0: Yep.

837
01:01:31,895 --> 01:01:32,746
Speaker 0: And I hope there's more '99s.

838
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:33,589
Speaker 0: How long did we review that?

839
01:01:35,032 --> 01:01:38,634
Speaker 0: I would not run out and buy like a Switch to play Pac-Man 99.

840
01:01:38,634 --> 01:01:39,463
Speaker 0: I think that's a little...

841
01:01:46,263 --> 01:01:48,400
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

842
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:53,540
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

843
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,940

844
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,880
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

845
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:06,620
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

847
01:02:11,403 --> 01:02:14,460
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

848
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,580
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

849
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:44,980
Speaker 1: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are... And a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

850
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:49,840
Speaker 1: And now, tonight, you might notice Scott's audio is a little bit iffy in the very first part of the show.

851
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,960
Speaker 1: He forgot to hit record in his audition on his side.

852
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:59,340
Speaker 1: So I used the backup audio from the live stream, and then I melded back to him once he started recording.

853
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,437
Speaker 1: And anyway, now, I leave you with...
