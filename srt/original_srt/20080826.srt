1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,769
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday August 26.

2
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:12,290
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:18,299
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek night tonight Bionic commando Rearmed.

4
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:26,928
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:34,069
Speaker 0: Alright, this is it this weekend Friday Saturday Sunday.

6
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,495
Speaker 0: We're actually going to be at PAX in Seattle.

7
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:37,338
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

8
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:39,932
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh We are not the shit talkers.

9
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:45,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean about a year ago We're like yeah, we're gonna go to PAX and then we on the air kind of forced ourselves to commit to it.

10
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,328
Speaker 0: And I think you were like yeah, we'll probably go.

11
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,312
Speaker 0: and you're like no we're going.

12
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:51,720
Speaker 0: I was like yeah, we're definitely going.

13
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:57,944
Speaker 1: That's because of our ultimate strategy of if we're not sure we're gonna actually do something say We'll do it and then not.

14
00:00:57,964 --> 00:00:59,248
Speaker 1: but I know we say it.

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,680
Speaker 1: You know vaguely like maybe we'll do this.

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:10,968
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna make a promise of when but this will happen at some point probably most Definitely kind of sort of go to fact.

17
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:17,968
Speaker 1: so we said you're definitely gonna go to PAX and we definitely are Unless something happens like, you know something crazy.

18
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:19,432
Speaker 1: No planes exploding.

19
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:22,360
Speaker 0: We're gonna be in Seattle pretty much Friday Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

20
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:27,918
Speaker 0: So we've already talked to some listeners one awesome listeners actually going to pick us up at the airport.

21
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,384
Speaker 1: if they fail We'll just take a cab.

22
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:29,806
Speaker 1: It's alright.

23
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:30,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, I rent a car or something.

24
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,620
Speaker 1: I don't think we need to rent a car.

25
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,460
Speaker 0: You know, it's not that far be useful to get around the town.

26
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:36,945
Speaker 1: I think we'll just walk.

27
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:46,540
Speaker 0: I could foresee us renting a car on Sunday or Monday To go around and do stuff because Seattle is not known for its mass transit at least not compared to New York City.

28
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:48,988
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is we're gonna be there.

29
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,897
Speaker 1: We're doing one awesome panel on Saturday.

30
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,140
Speaker 1: at what 630?

31
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,609
Speaker 0: Yeah at exactly 6 o'clock p.m.

32
00:01:55,809 --> 00:02:00,246
Speaker 0: On Saturday August 30th in the satellite theater room 307.

33
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,000
Speaker 1: I believe that is the Wolfman theater.

34
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:14,347
Speaker 1: I like how they give names to their to the rooms there the Wolfman theater Scott and I will be performing Once again second time ever beyond Dungeons & Dragons, which I Don't do dragons the reprise.

35
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,955
Speaker 0: I think I believe it's pronounced for prize.

36
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:18,420
Speaker 1: Well, I keep I always mess it up.

37
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:21,680
Speaker 1: I was thinking reprise and I said reprise thinking I'll be whatever.

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:33,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, the important thing is of all the panels we've done at conventions and they're like 30 or 40 on the list right now Beyond Dungeons & Dragons is all I would say the best one we've ever done.

39
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:40,839
Speaker 1: When we gave that panel the audience was pretty rockin and we were pretty rockin and it felt real good doing that.

40
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,260
Speaker 0: pan It did and I think part of it was that we didn't let the audience talking to.

41
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,519
Speaker 0: We actually put a little bit of thought into this one.

42
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:50,160
Speaker 1: We put thought into some of the other panel.

43
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:52,499
Speaker 0: Yeah we did but there's the difference between.

44
00:02:53,041 --> 00:03:00,020
Speaker 0: Here is a whole bunch of stuff from a manga and we're gonna talk about it versus giving a semi academic lecture.

45
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:10,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, then the other thing is that we're it's something we're really super passionate about and also, you know Doubly not passionate, but I thought gecky guy was all about passion.

46
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,240
Speaker 1: We are I'm passionate about the gecky guy, but I'm only half as knowledgeable about the gecky guys some other people.

47
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:17,125
Speaker 0: That is one thing.

48
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:23,720
Speaker 1: I mean, we know a lot about you know, the gecky guy like we do a lot of anime It's like we know more about that stuff than the average person.

49
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:29,220
Speaker 1: But there are people who know way more than us way more and those people need to do more panels.

50
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,734
Speaker 0: I guess they do granted Otakon edelup over there.

51
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:32,819
Speaker 0: This is neither here nor there.

52
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:39,356
Speaker 0: What is there is this weekend Saturday August 30th 6 p.m Satellite theater room 307 Wolfman.

53
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:45,739
Speaker 1: Yep in addition to that If you are going to PAX and you want a geek night's t-shirt, right?

54
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:48,498
Speaker 1: We will not have a table or anything there.

55
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:54,826
Speaker 1: So and we won't have any way to bring stuff with us a lot of stuff because we're on an airplane We can only bring so much.

56
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:59,666
Speaker 1: So if you want a t-shirt a geek nice t-shirt, it's $14 $15 it is standard t-shirts small medium.

57
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:06,113
Speaker 0: I make a mistake like that 14 Oh 15 15 dollars.

58
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:14,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, sorry They're regular, you know unisex t-shirts they are anvil blends.

59
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:18,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, very nice We have sizes small through extra-large.

60
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:18,469
Speaker 1: That's it.

61
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,918
Speaker 1: We don't have XXL or XS or anything like that and Certain sizes might run out.

62
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:32,151
Speaker 1: You'd have to email us before packs right before we leave to email us before Tomorrow at like 8 p.m.

63
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,316
Speaker 0: Eastern Daylight Time.

64
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:34,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

65
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:45,930
Speaker 1: You have to email us pretty much ASAP and tell us which size you want And if we have one left We will try to pack it and bring it with us and then I guess you have to buy it from us at our panel And that's gonna work.

66
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,972
Speaker 0: if you want to find us at the con pretty much Look in the forum because you know, we'll have internet there.

67
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,860
Speaker 0: So I might post randomly.

68
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,471
Speaker 0: Hey Saturday, blah blah blah.

69
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:57,680
Speaker 0: We're going to such-and-such for dinner and drinks.

70
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,092
Speaker 1: I'll also probably be tweeting it up a little bit.

71
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:00,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott's it.

72
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:01,820
Speaker 0: Scott's the Twitter shitters.

73
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:07,079
Speaker 1: I guess I'll tweet, you know when we're shitting and when we're not shitting and you'll be able to find us.

74
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:16,072
Speaker 0: and also I would like to point out that we're doing beyond Dungeons & Dragons, which is I Don't want to call it a hour-long ad for burning wheel.

75
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:18,060
Speaker 0: It's about a 20-minute ad for burning wheel.

76
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:18,904
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

77
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:22,180
Speaker 1: we do significantly talk about other non burning wheel game.

78
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,740
Speaker 1: Well, actually the thing is we actually talked a lot about primetime adventures and inspectors.

79
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,462
Speaker 0: well, the thing is it?

80
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:36,325
Speaker 0: what it really is is it's about 40 minutes of academic lecture followed by equal parts burning wheel inspectors and Primetime adventures.

81
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:43,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's mostly a bashing of D&D more than it is a You know course when we say Dean if the funny thing is it was so great.

82
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,680
Speaker 0: We're like, hey blah blah blah.

83
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:53,575
Speaker 0: And we're kind of talking about how D&D is a bad system and I saw all the nerds in the audience Much like I would have done if I had been in that audience

84
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,527
Speaker 1: if I had been in that audience in 2002

85
00:05:56,527 --> 00:06:01,227
Speaker 0: if I'd been in that audience anytime before I met Luke crane in my life I probably would have started me like.

86
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:01,969
Speaker 0: that is true.

87
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:02,350
Speaker 1: It's true.

88
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:05,180
Speaker 1: The first time you told me about the burning wheels, right?

89
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:13,021
Speaker 1: I was like, yeah Cuz I was skeptical pretty much any time anyone had ever come to me in my life and said I got a better role-playing System.

90
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:15,569
Speaker 1: It was just always some stupid nerdy shit.

91
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,117
Speaker 0: It was always like I use deep 30.

92
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:19,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was no better It was no.

93
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:21,951
Speaker 1: it was just another piece of crap, whatever.

94
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:23,237
Speaker 0: or there were the weird ones like l5r.

95
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,819
Speaker 0: That was really fun, but difficult to play because no one knew it.

96
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,783
Speaker 0: He had to teach.

97
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:29,169
Speaker 1: burning wheel was the first one.

98
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,555
Speaker 1: that was actually different.

99
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:44,747
Speaker 0: but seeing the audience go What are these are and like that one guy even raised his hand and look they all wanted to stop us like we're about to commit some profane act and the only thing they can do is object and stop the horrible demon from being summoned.

100
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:54,007
Speaker 0: but basically About ten minutes later the fact that all of them put their hands down and were listening and by the end all of them Wanted to play burning wheel.

101
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:54,993
Speaker 0: I was real happy.

102
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:55,798
Speaker 1: It was good time.

103
00:06:55,858 --> 00:07:09,419
Speaker 0: So if you want to play burning wheel It just so happens that Luke crane the creator of burning wheel and perhaps the only person in the history of the world Who actually and truly deserves the title?

104
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,685
Speaker 0: Rockstar game master.

105
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:15,680
Speaker 0: and if you don't think that that is justified you need to play a game with this man.

106
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:16,645
Speaker 0: It is frightening.

107
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:29,859
Speaker 1: I'm sure he'll be running the game in the tabletop room Which actually I've heard that the tabletop gaming at PAX is actually going to be in a separate building Because there's no room for it Which is actually kind of good because then it'll be nice and quiet and away from the hubbub.

108
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:30,321
Speaker 1: So

109
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:46,986
Speaker 0: the plan is and I have talked to Luke crane about this because they're going to be there We are going to run our panel and then we're going to direct and possibly lead the entire crowd of anyone who is willing Gathering ne'er-do-wells and spirits along the way Directly to Luke crane's doorstep.

110
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:55,692
Speaker 0: We will darken his door and he's gonna run some motherfucking burning wheel for your kids Speaking of burning whale summoning demons and darkening doors.

111
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:56,615
Speaker 0: What about death magic?

112
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:58,000
Speaker 0: Oh my god death magic.

113
00:07:58,282 --> 00:08:07,069
Speaker 1: Oh my god, if you want to summon some demons of your own There is a book that tells you how to do this and that book is the magic burner mag boo The long-awaited mag boo.

114
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,854
Speaker 0: didn't it sell out.

115
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:08,859
Speaker 0: Can you actually buy it again?

116
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,506
Speaker 1: There was a pre-order.

117
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,818
Speaker 1: you had to I. basically I reloaded the page crazily to get in.

118
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:16,767
Speaker 1: I got number 141 out of 200.

119
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:20,440
Speaker 1: I'm sure you'll be able to order them again when there is another print run.

120
00:08:20,822 --> 00:08:22,569
Speaker 1: I don't know what the status is right now.

121
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:25,020
Speaker 1: watch burning wheel calm for news.

122
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:30,699
Speaker 1: Anyway, I got this book in the mail this past weekend as did seemingly everyone else who ordered it.

123
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:36,693
Speaker 0: It is well worth all of your monies It's one of you know, that's the thing about burning wheel.

124
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:37,600
Speaker 0: that is really amazing.

125
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,736
Speaker 0: I mean, I've had the same experience.

126
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:45,764
Speaker 0: reading Joke games like reading the rule book to human-occupied landfill is really funny And I really enjoy it.

127
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:59,320
Speaker 0: playing the game is not fun or possible really but reading bird like anytime I read a burning wheel book a laugh at something that I didn't notice before And I'll have some sort of insight into like what it is to roleplay and the mag boo is that times 10.

128
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:13,132
Speaker 1: There's one thing even if you're never going to play burning wheel ever in your entire life Really you should buy as many burning wheel official burning wheel books as you can because Just reading them alone is like this treat, you know.

129
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:15,520
Speaker 1: reading D&D is mostly a reference book, you know.

130
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,546
Speaker 1: And burning wheel books have some reference in them.

131
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:21,840
Speaker 1: But even the reference material has content to it humorous content.

132
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,820
Speaker 1: He's a Jonah Jonah that one, you know when you're reading through and you see okay that life path has a trait.

133
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,009
Speaker 1: He's a Jonah that one.

134
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,480
Speaker 1: that's funny stuff.

135
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,028
Speaker 1: There's funny stuff going on.

136
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,340
Speaker 1: and basically here's the deal with the magic burner.

137
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,900
Speaker 1: Let me I'm not gonna review the whole book, but let me sum it up for you.

138
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:47,100
Speaker 1: Right, the original burning wheel had rooms for rules for magic, but the rules for magic were not super fleshed out They were just sort of baseline and they applied equally to all kinds of magic.

139
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,196
Speaker 1: Right the new the magic burner splits it up into all the different kinds of magic.

140
00:09:52,276 --> 00:09:57,452
Speaker 1: right art magic Necromancy, which is death art, you know, just setting people on fire.

141
00:09:57,512 --> 00:09:59,057
Speaker 1: That's our you know, magic items.

142
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:04,097
Speaker 1: Everything is split up Alright religion magic nature magic like druid stuff.

143
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:08,971
Speaker 1: and What it's done is it didn't actually introduce.

144
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:12,723
Speaker 1: it introduced some but not many new mechanics mostly.

145
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:29,140
Speaker 1: what this book does is show you how to use the existing burning wheel mechanics right to get these magic systems as many of them or as little of them to work in your game as you want and You can sort of choose, you know how you want the different magics to work.

146
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,613
Speaker 1: They're like, hey if you you know, it's not like D&D where it's this spell does this.

147
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:38,354
Speaker 1: it's more like well If you want a world, you know where there's only some gifted people have magic.

148
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:38,776
Speaker 1: do this.

149
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:39,860
Speaker 1: if you want a world where?

150
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,958
Speaker 1: everyone uses magic to sort of you know, fix all the broken stuff in their house do this.

151
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:48,459
Speaker 1: and basically to sum up the rules in the book.

152
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,267
Speaker 1: This is this is the summary of the book.

153
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,744
Speaker 1: if someone wants to do something in burning wheel You know you roll the dice.

154
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:56,511
Speaker 1: if you succeed hooray.

155
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,518
Speaker 1: if you fail consequences, that's burning wheel.

156
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,731
Speaker 0: Burning wheel if you succeed hooray.

157
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:04,379
Speaker 1: if you fail hooray Exactly, but it's consequences when you fail.

158
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:21,905
Speaker 1: The magic rules are if you want to have a better chance of doing something if you want to take your magical Power and use it to help you do something there is a chance that either a you'll have a better chance of succeeding or B you'll be able to succeed at something better than normal.

159
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:30,300
Speaker 1: if You do succeed with magic aid You will succeed but there's a price to pay for that magical power.

160
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:38,280
Speaker 1: But if you fail when using magic the consequences are doubly horrible doubly horrible.

161
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:40,696
Speaker 1: Oh, they're horrible because you failed at magic.

162
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:43,092
Speaker 1: Good God You'll blow shit up or kill people.

163
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,059
Speaker 1: who knows what's gonna happen?

164
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:55,840
Speaker 1: But usually when you fail epically with magic There is some slight benefit that comes out of it some like oh you died Your soul is damned for eternity along with all your family everyone you've ever met.

165
00:11:56,562 --> 00:12:02,000
Speaker 0: But out of the ashes came a sword and trusted with all those souls and it's wicked badass and your son is not wielding.

166
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:04,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's all sorts of stuff like that.

167
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,720
Speaker 1: And you know, it applies to every realm of magic.

168
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,704
Speaker 1: There's just different rules.

169
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:13,000
Speaker 1: My favorite stuff in the book are sort of the alternate consequences kind of stuff.

170
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,040
Speaker 1: It's like well remember how someone rolled circles, you know, and they failed as the enmity clause.

171
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:26,339
Speaker 1: Well, if they're corrupt as rules for corruption in the book, right when you're like a nasty old ugly wizard with eyes falling out You're corrupt, right?

172
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,670
Speaker 1: There's rules for corruption where for corrupt person fails a circles test.

173
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:37,609
Speaker 1: instead of the enmity clause you could go with the creepy clause Or you could go with the mortal enemy clause.

174
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:57,258
Speaker 0: I mean the sum total of all this is that this is a really really Fascinating and fantastic book that really expands on burning wheel and a lot because the only complaint I've ever heard Really levied against it from people who played it and tried it out for any length of time Was that in with the default rule said it wasn't easy to shoehorn a high magic world in.

175
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:58,906
Speaker 1: yeah Well, it's designed.

176
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:01,860
Speaker 1: burning wheel is specifically designed for low magic worlds.

177
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:08,951
Speaker 0: However, this book lets you do pretty much anything you could possibly imagine and do it Well and interestingly for good role-playing.

178
00:13:09,111 --> 00:13:15,620
Speaker 1: it basically prevents the high Magicness that would have destroyed an original burning wheel game from destroying a burning wheel game.

179
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,337
Speaker 0: the other thing is it kind of reveals.

180
00:13:17,418 --> 00:13:22,316
Speaker 0: I mean I don't think it appears that Luke Crane and them have never read the prince of nothing books.

181
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:26,051
Speaker 0: because if you read those books You think wow, this is a burning wheel campaign.

182
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:29,705
Speaker 0: and if you play a burning wheel you think wow This is the prince of nothing.

183
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:31,713
Speaker 0: and yet no, they're not related at all.

184
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:33,840
Speaker 0: He based his magic on something completely different.

185
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:42,711
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you look in the book, they make lots of references to fantasy novels all the time and in the magic burner They're mostly referencing, you know Earthsea and such.

186
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:49,660
Speaker 1: and you know Earthsea by Ursula K Le Guin is awesome And it has a great magic system and basing it on that totally fits.

187
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:53,700
Speaker 1: But they don't mention prince of nothing at all, which tells me they haven't read it.

188
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:55,949
Speaker 0: I'd really be curious to see I got.

189
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,420
Speaker 0: I feel like I should just bring him a copy of the first book and just leave It on his desk or table or wherever he's gonna be at.

190
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,160
Speaker 1: Just bring the three volumes and give them to do whatever you want on the plane with all the other crap.

191
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,863
Speaker 0: I gotta carry it.

192
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:04,983
Speaker 0: all.

193
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:08,880
Speaker 0: those t-shirts were probably have to be to log in and probably buy it at a bookstore in Seattle.

194
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:10,560
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea.

195
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:15,080
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, the best part about the magic burner is the beginning.

196
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:18,934
Speaker 1: There's an essay by Tor Olavsrud who is sort of like Luke's right-hand man.

197
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:20,560
Speaker 1: is you know, we interviewed him, right?

198
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,484
Speaker 1: He was on that interview.

199
00:14:21,524 --> 00:14:21,725
Speaker 0: Yeah.

200
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:26,184
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you guys you know, you're curious you're new to geek nights Which I hope you are.

201
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:29,400
Speaker 0: a lot of people probably medicine packs and oh, it's a geek nights thing.

202
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:32,893
Speaker 0: We interviewed Luke crane a long time ago at uber con.

203
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:33,976
Speaker 1: It was actually a great interview.

204
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:34,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll put a link to it.

205
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,804
Speaker 0: It was really fun.

206
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:38,215
Speaker 0: Basically Scott did it while I sat there fiddling with knobs.

207
00:14:38,235 --> 00:14:40,797
Speaker 0: that was back and we were kind of Shall we say?

208
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:45,420
Speaker 1: Amateurs at this whole radio business and we did a lot better than some of the stuff we've done recently.

209
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,102
Speaker 0: Oh my god,

210
00:14:46,563 --> 00:15:04,660
Speaker 1: but yeah that interview, you know Tor was there and Tor wrote this essay about magic and fantasy worlds and how it plays into the story and the different kinds of magic users and the archetypes and it's really fascinating and it it Helped me learn a lot about you know, my role playing as well as you know, the use of magic and fantasy worlds.

211
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:05,989
Speaker 1: It's it's great.

212
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:17,350
Speaker 0: So speaking of all that On slash shot I've here's the headline Wizards of the coast Declares gleam axe site.

213
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,214
Speaker 0: a critical failure.

214
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:19,098
Speaker 0: now gleam axe.

215
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,250
Speaker 0: Thus I wondered gleam axe?

216
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,012
Speaker 0: so I went.

217
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:26,179
Speaker 0: you know, I was like, all right gleam axe.

218
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:30,511
Speaker 0: calm I'm presented with one of the ugliest websites I've ever seen.

219
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:33,420
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, Scott can see it from Craig's list.

220
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:34,326
Speaker 0: It's pretty.

221
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:38,786
Speaker 0: I would rather be at Craigslist because Craigslist Sacrifices form for function.

222
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:39,629
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

223
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,993
Speaker 0: This does not.

224
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:44,666
Speaker 0: it sacrifices everything for nothing For not.

225
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:45,951
Speaker 0: I say wow.

226
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:46,774
Speaker 0: All right one.

227
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:49,323
Speaker 0: There's a weekly poll on the right Medusa.

228
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:50,467
Speaker 0: his first pick snakes.

229
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:53,798
Speaker 0: What will you choose for your supernatural hair?

230
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:54,500
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

231
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,663
Speaker 1: What are the choices with the choices?

232
00:15:55,944 --> 00:16:00,415
Speaker 0: mangeese clever clever for choosing mangeese as opposed to mongooses.

233
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:09,331
Speaker 0: Yep squid tentacles scorpion tails Venus flytraps lobster claws Semperini Semperino.

234
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:11,783
Speaker 0: Semperini is not that Lobster claws.

235
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:12,605
Speaker 1: What do you pick?

236
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:14,772
Speaker 0: I'm gonna pick mongoose and see what happens.

237
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:16,396
Speaker 0: Ah, it's all about the mongoose.

238
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,274
Speaker 0: Ah Scorpion tails wins by a land.

239
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:27,667
Speaker 0: Oh, it's all right, so Gleam axe is Apparently and I had no idea.

240
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:30,395
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone we knew had any idea.

241
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:35,119
Speaker 0: the fact that I didn't know Probably explains why it failed.

242
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:45,380
Speaker 0: Gleam axe was Wizards of the coast online social networking site quotes Originally designed to create a central hub where gamers could meet discuss and play games online.

243
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,889
Speaker 1: So they're just trying to make a Facebook for gamers only.

244
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:50,720
Speaker 0: but I had never even heard of it.

245
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:53,192
Speaker 0: I'm really kind of on the inside here.

246
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,780
Speaker 0: I honestly I'd never heard of it.

247
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,005
Speaker 0: I had no idea it existed.

248
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:59,839
Speaker 0: so I can't imagine how they thought this was gonna succeed.

249
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:02,954
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was probably just like, you know a thing that they spell.

250
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:04,180
Speaker 1: Oh, that's an obvious idea.

251
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,973
Speaker 1: Of course, it'll just succeed if we just do it.

252
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:11,939
Speaker 0: We don't need to try that Yeah, but but I got a read from the official gleam axe for one gleam axe who named that.

253
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:15,635
Speaker 1: Oh my Glee, is that supposed to be something glee?

254
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:16,440
Speaker 1: Is that a rat?

255
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,955
Speaker 1: Is that a reference to one of those D&D fantasy worlds like forgotten around?

256
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:22,732
Speaker 0: No, or No, Lance.

257
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:31,982
Speaker 0: I have no Exes but up quotes post maximum glee Randy B Randy B Wizards of the coast Wizards up.

258
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:43,189
Speaker 0: that has made the decision to pull down his gleam axe social networking site in order to focus on other aspects of our digital initiatives especially Magic online and Dungeons & Dragons insider.

259
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:49,435
Speaker 0: now Eve writes a bunch more paragraphs and they don't matter But here's what I'm interested in.

260
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:53,772
Speaker 0: one Magic online is probably gonna do pretty well among punk age.

261
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:57,368
Speaker 1: I think magic online's been around for a long time I know but it's still around.

262
00:17:57,428 --> 00:18:09,938
Speaker 0: so but I'd like to point out that according to Every comment I can find on the internet internet in or not D&D insider is terrible and everyone isn't that where you pay money to get like extra D&D shit.

263
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:13,120
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah, so I don't know what's going on here.

264
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:24,420
Speaker 0: The only thing I can really say is that Wizards of the coast and by extension TSR though TSR had a little better luck They never seem to have understood the internet and what the internet is and what the internet is for and what the internet does.

265
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:24,762
Speaker 0: I mean?

266
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:29,078
Speaker 0: remember when D&D third aid came out and There was this CD.

267
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:33,580
Speaker 1: They almost had it right when they had the d20 system was open.

268
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:39,039
Speaker 1: They were there was the right step to do that and the SRD showed up and people started making all this d20.

269
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:44,053
Speaker 0: Well, well, well, well, it was the right step until I realized the fundamental flaw of d20.

270
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,916
Speaker 0: I like at the root basis level Yeah, but that that's a discussion for burning wheel.

271
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:52,480
Speaker 1: enough for the point Is that the openness was the right idea to get on the internet?

272
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,660
Speaker 1: But now they're going backwards with their openness and that hurts you on the internet.

273
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,744
Speaker 1: Not you realize that.

274
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:08,640
Speaker 0: there's something simple if you go to the D&D official websites you will not find the character sheets from every version of D&D ever which seems like the.

275
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:20,780
Speaker 0: If I had a website if I was watsy I would have every D&D character sheet ever and I have this whole open like free Downloads of all the old stuff and I'd pay for the rights or whatever because that sort of business.

276
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,870
Speaker 1: You own the rights you own TSR.

277
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,116
Speaker 1: You own the original D&D.

278
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:26,808
Speaker 1: Well then Who else own?

279
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,039
Speaker 1: if they don't own it who?

280
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:42,008
Speaker 0: The point is though, you know I'm reading through all these comments and the slash shot in particular and this seems to happen all the time degenerated right away into an argument about Fourth that is great versus fourth that is crap.

281
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:47,964
Speaker 0: third ed was great versus second ed was great and d20 ruined everything versus every Edition is just they add.

282
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:50,572
Speaker 1: they just segregate the fanboys even more.

283
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:54,785
Speaker 1: before it was third verse second verse first now It's fourth verse third verse second verse.

284
00:19:54,805 --> 00:20:00,169
Speaker 0: first thing is I've never met anyone who was actually human who thought that anything before second edition Was better than second.

285
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,693
Speaker 0: I Also have not then there, you know players option that was.

286
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:06,640
Speaker 0: that was something special right there.

287
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:11,467
Speaker 1: The reason that you don't find people rooting for before second edition stuff They're always dead.

288
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:13,440
Speaker 1: knows cuz all those people play hack master.

289
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:18,183
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, which if you're into that sort of thing hack master is the best way to go I can't deny.

290
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,833
Speaker 1: but you know if you're into that sort of thing, which I'm not.

291
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:22,982
Speaker 0: but the thing is it's like I saw all the Arguments.

292
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,268
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into it because I want to.

293
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:27,000
Speaker 0: I really want to talk about the thing we're talking about Lee Max.

294
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:28,183
Speaker 0: Yes, I want.

295
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:31,500
Speaker 0: no I don't want to talk about me next but these arguments.

296
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:37,600
Speaker 0: There's an elephant in the room the elephant being that D&D is not a role-playing system.

297
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:44,049
Speaker 0: It's just a combat based conflict resolution system That is more and more becoming just World of Warcraft the paper game.

298
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,907
Speaker 1: don't give away our panel and you spoil it and yet No one touches on that.

299
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:53,920
Speaker 0: all the arguments are fourth ed lets me play the character this way instead.

300
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,519
Speaker 0: No, but third ed let me do this.

301
00:20:55,801 --> 00:21:04,960
Speaker 1: Oh, but fourth ed has a better combat because they're arguing within the context of the assumption that D&D is You know this certain kind of game, but they don't think outside of that box.

302
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,420
Speaker 1: They're arguing within the box whereas we have broken out of the box, and we're looking at the box going.

303
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:11,880
Speaker 1: Why are these people bouncing around inside that box?

304
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,462
Speaker 0: I thought.

305
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:18,118
Speaker 0: but I thought saying that you're thinking out of the box was a pre web 2.0 idea And the idea was that we're gonna get back in the box.

306
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:23,485
Speaker 1: We do but getting back in the box doesn't mean going to play D&D again But just but that's the box.

307
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:24,528
Speaker 0: that mean there's two boxes.

308
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:27,679
Speaker 1: there could be a lot of boxes getting back in the box.

309
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:44,474
Speaker 0: Anyway things of the day in case anyone has not played the original game or seen it I must make my thing of the day.

310
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:50,190
Speaker 0: the the end of bionic commando the real the real bionic commander Hitler.

311
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:52,362
Speaker 0: No, Fukatsu Hitler.

312
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:53,750
Speaker 1: no top secret.

313
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:59,469
Speaker 0: That's all I got master D the first time I ever saw swearing in it in a NES game.

314
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:06,629
Speaker 0: Oh, man guy explodes and also one of the most innovative and best platformers ever made since Mario.

315
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:08,637
Speaker 0: yep That's all I got to say about it.

316
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:10,365
Speaker 0: It's the end of bionic commando.

317
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,530
Speaker 0: It's great space.

318
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,087
Speaker 1: You're saying hey people don't play the game watch the end.

319
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:21,216
Speaker 0: well Thing of the day the thing is if you watch this video The guy plays the exact same way I do like he beats the.

320
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:28,337
Speaker 0: you know the I guess the second to last boss the same trick I always used and even better he does the same kind of crap I do when he's waiting for stuff to explode.

321
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:31,049
Speaker 0: he's running around shooting stuff all over the place and just kind of.

322
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,930
Speaker 1: That's the NS way the natural selection method.

323
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,158
Speaker 0: We need a term for that.

324
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:39,949
Speaker 0: maybe jumping on the cheese.

325
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:45,610
Speaker 1: Anyway, my thing of the day is a flash game called fantastic contraption.

326
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:51,665
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty old But I discovered me and my co-worker discovered it pretty recently and the way this game works is.

327
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:52,588
Speaker 1: it's a physics game.

328
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:56,180
Speaker 1: right and You have a little screen and on the screen.

329
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:16,942
Speaker 1: There's some objects some pink objects You know maybe one or more and there is a pink goal area, and then there is a blue Machining area and you can build a machine in the blue area and then when you're ready you start that machine and The goal is to get the machine to somehow move

330
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,744
Speaker 0: the

331
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:19,710
Speaker 1: objects into the goal area.

332
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,244
Speaker 1: now The objects must be 100% within the goal area right all of the end.

333
00:23:24,284 --> 00:23:30,109
Speaker 1: if there are multiple goal objects All of them have to be 100% in the goal area at the same time.

334
00:23:30,772 --> 00:23:32,218
Speaker 1: So and then you win.

335
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:39,243
Speaker 1: so basically you have like 20 something maps And you're trying to find mission design machines to solve all of them.

336
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:44,050
Speaker 1: the great thing about this game Is that there are multiple solutions to any map?

337
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,729
Speaker 1: I mean you can make a vehicle you know, but some maps a vehicle doesn't work.

338
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:50,370
Speaker 1: You know some maps you can make sort of like a trebuchet.

339
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:56,068
Speaker 0: I mean basically the thing is what makes this game great is that you have very few components to work with.

340
00:23:56,129 --> 00:24:01,830
Speaker 0: it's not It's a. it's a very complex, but extremely simple game at the same time, and that's what makes it fun.

341
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could.

342
00:24:02,392 --> 00:24:11,090
Speaker 1: basically you have water sticks wood sticks clockwise balls counterclockwise balls Non-moving balls, and that's about it.

343
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,020
Speaker 1: That's all you got and you got to build everything using those.

344
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:18,910
Speaker 1: you know five pieces, and it's not easy But it's all possible.

345
00:24:19,351 --> 00:24:25,150
Speaker 1: You can actually pay for the game to get user generate user made maps if you if you get bored of the existing maps.

346
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:34,050
Speaker 1: But the best thing about this game is looking after you beat a map Looking at how everyone else solved it and all the really creative crazy solutions out there.

347
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:36,050
Speaker 0: There are some crazy machines on YouTube.

348
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:36,852
Speaker 1: It's just.

349
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:44,550
Speaker 1: it's just really fascinating and I think that when people talk about user generated content and video games You know they keep getting it wrong.

350
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:51,310
Speaker 1: And I think this is what user generated content is where the playing of the game is the generating of the content.

351
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:53,894
Speaker 1: You know I play this game I solve a puzzle.

352
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:58,310
Speaker 1: my puzzle solution itself is content that is entertaining to other people.

353
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,177
Speaker 1: That is the way to go games.

354
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:03,850
Speaker 1: like you know line writer you play the game you draw this line.

355
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,898
Speaker 1: now The line you drew becomes content.

356
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:12,209
Speaker 1: that is where user generated content and games has to go And I can't wait to see other games that do the same sort of thing

357
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:23,829
Speaker 0: but Much like when we talked about portal, and we could not help but talk about portal as it was Possibly the most perfect release of any video game in the history of video games.

358
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:26,937
Speaker 0: Here we are having just finished.

359
00:25:26,977 --> 00:25:31,410
Speaker 0: well not finished, but having beaten enough to talk about by on a commando rearmed.

360
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:36,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we talked about this last week or two weeks ago or something whatever, but that was you know unplayed.

361
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:42,146
Speaker 0: We watched that trailer, and we talked about how excited we were and I was downloading it during the show.

362
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:47,905
Speaker 0: if I remember well It hasn't been that long and this this game was like one.

363
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:51,090
Speaker 0: This was the most fun I've had playing a game since portal.

364
00:25:51,799 --> 00:26:04,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely I have to agree 100% but I had a commando rearmed is like the game if you buy any video game This year so far by portal, and if you haven't if you've already this year, I don't even know.

365
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:05,076
Speaker 0: hey Why not?

366
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,050
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

367
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:06,796
Speaker 1: I think so.

368
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,349
Speaker 1: whether it was or not Right by the commando rearmed is either the best or second best game of the year.

369
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:14,917
Speaker 1: now The thing is by the commando rearmed.

370
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:19,149
Speaker 1: right is just a remake of the original by on a commando.

371
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:20,714
Speaker 0: however That is a game.

372
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:23,142
Speaker 0: well that does and does not do it justice.

373
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:32,216
Speaker 0: if you have played the original by on a commando Then saying that is all that needs to be said because by on a commando is Probably the game most in.

374
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:37,250
Speaker 0: what was the game most in needing of a sequel on a modern console since Kid Icarus?

375
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,115
Speaker 1: Absolutely Kid Icarus.

376
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:39,296
Speaker 1: Good.

377
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:39,677
Speaker 1: God.

378
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:46,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is Kid Icarus was a fun game But it was frustrating and not that good of a game.

379
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:52,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I mean I talked about how Capcom is coming through reviving all the old games right in a good way.

380
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:54,516
Speaker 1: They got the Mega Man 9 coming right.

381
00:26:55,017 --> 00:26:57,825
Speaker 1: Street Fighter 4 is in the Chinatown arcade.

382
00:26:58,065 --> 00:26:59,589
Speaker 1: Holy shit, right.

383
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:11,529
Speaker 0: and By the commander we are I mean if any game was ever so true to the original content and yet at the same time Took advantage of modern technology to make a better game.

384
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,138
Speaker 0: It fixed everything.

385
00:27:14,178 --> 00:27:19,475
Speaker 0: what little there was to say badly about the original by on a commando And it added more.

386
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:24,050
Speaker 1: it was and everything they have added more has only been for the better and not for the worst.

387
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,082
Speaker 1: They didn't go crazy adding too much stuff to ruin the game right.

388
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:35,330
Speaker 1: they added stuff that made the game better and Removed only what made the game bad, and it's basically they took off.

389
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:44,070
Speaker 1: It's like going into your closet finding something really old and cruddy But you loved it when you were a kid and polishing it and making it like new and giving a new paint job.

390
00:27:44,492 --> 00:27:58,195
Speaker 0: I mean, they just they understand and I've said this before but It's proven beyond a shadow of a doubt now They understand what it was like the essence of these old games that made them good, and they take that essence alone Extracted from an old game.

391
00:27:58,215 --> 00:27:58,817
Speaker 0: that is not.

392
00:27:59,238 --> 00:28:08,170
Speaker 0: those old games don't stand up to modern games or at least the what modern games could Be but they take that essence and they make new games that have everything that was good.

393
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:13,570
Speaker 0: It's all right the game is just the original by on a commando, but I mean what do they change?

394
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:19,926
Speaker 1: By the way just just some people know we played the PC version for $15 on direct-to-drive.com.

395
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:22,694
Speaker 0: buy it however be warned the DRM Socks just deal with.

396
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:26,869
Speaker 1: yeah, if you have an Xbox or a ps3 get it that way don't get it with the PC version.

397
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:28,756
Speaker 1: I don't know what the difference is though.

398
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:33,694
Speaker 1: if there's if there is any difference all I know is we play the PC version And that's all I know about.

399
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:37,970
Speaker 0: I'll say one thing you're gonna need a controller and to don't use one of those gravis pads.

400
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,714
Speaker 0: They're terrible.

401
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:39,277
Speaker 0: yeah get.

402
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:43,339
Speaker 1: you probably want an Xbox 360 Controller for the PC.

403
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:51,150
Speaker 0: however if you've got a USB thing I just connected my old ps1 controller to my DDR pad connector, and I plug that into my computer.

404
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:51,828
Speaker 0: It worked okay.

405
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:59,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, that works just fine too, but Xbox 360 controller for the PC is the way to go, but I mean What does this talk about?

406
00:28:59,054 --> 00:28:59,716
Speaker 0: what they've changed?

407
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:04,470
Speaker 0: this first one the boss battles in the original bionic commando were laughable.

408
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:05,032
Speaker 0: They were.

409
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:07,621
Speaker 1: they were basically the way those boss battles worked.

410
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:10,210
Speaker 1: you would walk to the end of the screen where the boss was.

411
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:12,590
Speaker 1: You would stand still and shoot until the boss died.

412
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:14,697
Speaker 0: Sometimes you had to fight a little bit.

413
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,843
Speaker 1: sometimes you occasionally had to grapple up.

414
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,870
Speaker 1: shoot a brunch grapple down shoot a bunch.

415
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:21,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't grapple down, but you know fall.

416
00:29:21,578 --> 00:29:22,581
Speaker 0: they were trivial.

417
00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:23,042
Speaker 0: the.

418
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:27,617
Speaker 0: they basically redid every single boss battle But yet they kept the style.

419
00:29:27,657 --> 00:29:29,966
Speaker 0: I mean that robot still says PvP.

420
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:30,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird.

421
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,637
Speaker 1: It's like it's the same boss somehow yet It's a completely different boss.

422
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:43,670
Speaker 0: the best one by far is There's always the first platoon in the second platoon and there'd be the guy at the top like waving that sword going attack attack attack.

423
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:45,937
Speaker 0: Yep, what they did with him.

424
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:47,903
Speaker 1: That's so fantastic.

425
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:49,367
Speaker 0: I laughed so hard.

426
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:49,768
Speaker 0: I died.

427
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:52,349
Speaker 1: I didn't laugh that hard when I saw it.

428
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:56,249
Speaker 0: But I don't think bionic commando is quite as near and dear to your heart as is to me now.

429
00:29:56,611 --> 00:30:00,010
Speaker 1: But they definitely load it up on the humor in this game big time.

430
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,688
Speaker 0: I mean the fact that here's what bionic commando was taught me.

431
00:30:03,472 --> 00:30:09,129
Speaker 0: Number one the more facial hair you have the higher ranking you are unless you're the leader.

432
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:14,382
Speaker 0: and all the interactions between like the bad guys when you hack into the computer are classic.

433
00:30:14,422 --> 00:30:27,327
Speaker 0: because you know the guys basically just have Unless they're a main character or a boss one face and it's kind of this Soviet idealized like propaganda art and the foot soldier.

434
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:35,830
Speaker 0: the private is this Glowing Adonis of a man with a perfect chin And he's just kind of looking up with admiration and pride and his commander has a mustache.

435
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:43,102
Speaker 0: And then at the end of the game or near the end of the game you see that guy's commander And he has a full beard, but they're otherwise the exact same guy.

436
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:45,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, and just the dialogue.

437
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:49,513
Speaker 0: It's almost like this avid and Costello kind of straight man crazy It's.

438
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:51,765
Speaker 0: so I don't I can't really express to you.

439
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:52,408
Speaker 0: How funny it is.

440
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,870
Speaker 1: They really load it up on the humor.

441
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:57,330
Speaker 1: I mean there's also some other funny stuff in the game, too.

442
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:09,664
Speaker 1: Like you'll have these machines that are bosses and some of the machines are just automatic And then they'll have this dialogue between you know the body commando and this Robotic boss and the dialogue is like the boss of like PPP.

443
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:11,852
Speaker 1: He'll be like shut up It's.

444
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,317
Speaker 1: I don't know why it's funny.

445
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:18,848
Speaker 0: It just is what I mean in terms of forget gameplay in terms of essence I keep saying essence here.

446
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:31,362
Speaker 0: They took all the things that were weird about the original bionic commando but kind of like things that added to the atmosphere like The guys that piloted any machine and bionic commando were midgets.

447
00:31:31,443 --> 00:31:36,332
Speaker 0: basically just because of the way the sprites were like there's little half-tall dudes in This game.

448
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:39,865
Speaker 0: they made that cannon and they basically the way they explained.

449
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:40,488
Speaker 0: It was just that.

450
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:47,633
Speaker 0: alright The cute like this boss get you destroy him by pulling him down with weight like you hang on to it pulls the thing down You blow it up whatever.

451
00:31:48,236 --> 00:31:50,805
Speaker 0: so to let you in on this secret.

452
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,350
Speaker 0: They basically talk about how yeah I can't hold any extra weight of course you idiot.

453
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,998
Speaker 0: That's why we have midgets to pilot everything.

454
00:31:56,018 --> 00:32:00,605
Speaker 0: and sure enough you argue with the midget And then you fight him and then you kill him.

455
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:03,018
Speaker 0: yeah Midgets are hilarious.

456
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:17,098
Speaker 1: the midgets are definitely the funniest characters in the game Especially the first one who's riding the tank and the fact that all the dialogue is like gatekeepers like everyone is point yell dramatic pose dramatic pose Good times.

457
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,899
Speaker 1: I love how the So-called boss you know refers to the leader.

458
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,524
Speaker 1: He's like yes that leader.

459
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:25,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've revived him.

460
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:36,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's definitely a nod to the fact that the original bionic commando was Reskinned away from Hitler no Fukatsu in order to not offend the sensibilities of Americans.

461
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like at the end of the game.

462
00:32:38,063 --> 00:32:39,050
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid playing.

463
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,057
Speaker 0: It's like this game is fun and really hard.

464
00:32:41,097 --> 00:32:41,800
Speaker 0: this game is fun.

465
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:42,603
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

466
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:44,530
Speaker 0: Is that Hitler basically Hitler?

467
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:52,123
Speaker 1: Just kill that guy and then swear at me the original bionic commando Which is I think super spy or secret spy top secret.

468
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:53,428
Speaker 0: it was an arcade game.

469
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:56,134
Speaker 1: It was top Senjou no Okami.

470
00:32:56,656 --> 00:32:58,120
Speaker 1: yeah Hitler no Fukatsu right?

471
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:03,977
Speaker 0: no no no the arcade game was top secret Senjou no Okami Okay, and then the NES game.

472
00:33:03,997 --> 00:33:07,066
Speaker 0: well the fact the Famicom game was top secret.

473
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:12,070
Speaker 1: Hitler no Fukatsu All right, but anyway that game was like Hitler Hitler Hitler.

474
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:17,522
Speaker 1: But the US version took out the Hitler But you knew it was Hitler in the nuver in the vert.

475
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,430
Speaker 1: in the new version bionic men are rearmed.

476
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:29,150
Speaker 1: They basically go like they don't say the word Hitler They just wink and nod all the time like you know leader nudge nudge wink wink say no more.

477
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:40,488
Speaker 0: You know with a big mustache from that war a long time ago, and then at the end of directing him It's the same nudge nudge and all the dialogue is different because the dialogue was kind of broken.

478
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:42,330
Speaker 0: the original game You know bad translation, whatever.

479
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:55,130
Speaker 0: Every single line that was in the original game that was hilarious or just stood out Or was memorable is in this game in some kind of altered context which makes it hilarious.

480
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:58,163
Speaker 0: I mean when what's-his-name yells you damn nerd.

481
00:33:58,685 --> 00:33:59,730
Speaker 0: I about crap myself.

482
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:03,030
Speaker 1: There's definitely a lot of joke damn nerd get out of here.

483
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:06,410
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things that are just references to the original game.

484
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,250
Speaker 1: I mean even if you never played the original game, it'll still be awesome.

485
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:14,370
Speaker 1: But if you did play the original bad at commando, and then you play this and you see all the references.

486
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,989
Speaker 1: You're just doubly awesome.

487
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:22,121
Speaker 0: I mean when the helicopter pilot is making fun of the fact that you don't wear armor And then later on you get a helmet.

488
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:23,829
Speaker 0: She's like oh, it's about time.

489
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,864
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to keep going on.

490
00:34:26,905 --> 00:34:27,730
Speaker 0: I'll just start spoiling.

491
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:32,350
Speaker 0: This is gonna turn into the kind of like if we ever tried to review a good comedy movie like I don't know Ferris Bueller.

492
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,746
Speaker 0: Let's just quote it.

493
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:35,857
Speaker 1: Let's play about the gameplay right.

494
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:43,900
Speaker 1: first of all one thing you can do is you can change weapons on the fly And you don't have to pick the right goddamn communicator.

495
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:44,864
Speaker 0: It just handles that.

496
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:52,946
Speaker 1: yeah these two things Makes the game so great and also because the original bad at commando You can only bring one weapon into a level.

497
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:56,221
Speaker 0: that was it But it didn't matter because basically you beat the first level.

498
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:58,329
Speaker 0: then you immediately went and got the bazooka.

499
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:01,510
Speaker 0: Use the bazooka in every single level that you could until the end of the game.

500
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:02,714
Speaker 0: Everything else.

501
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:06,890
Speaker 1: the bazooka is pretty awesome, but there are different uses for different weapons.

502
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,319
Speaker 1: Sometimes you want to use a different gun besides the bazooka.

503
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:12,250
Speaker 0: I use every weapon on a regular basis except the main gun.

504
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,249
Speaker 1: However, you also have these awesome grenades.

505
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:15,074
Speaker 0: Here's the deal.

506
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:20,763
Speaker 0: all the grenades add so much to the game, but in the original game You know you go talk to district.

507
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:23,356
Speaker 0: basically you got to save Super Joe and then you talk to.

508
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:26,289
Speaker 0: you know he tells you which of the destroyer brothers to talk to.

509
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:29,259
Speaker 0: and The game you know tried to be all cool.

510
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:31,790
Speaker 0: like you have to get the code and then talk to the right destroyer brother.

511
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:39,088
Speaker 0: it doesn't work, but if You just knew which guy to talk to you could get Super Joe's gun and it sucked ass and you didn't use it.

512
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:45,556
Speaker 0: in This game Super Joe's gun is one of the most satisfying Things I've ever used.

513
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:51,144
Speaker 0: in a game that there is a gun in it's basically an awesome rapid-fire machine gun of us But it feels so good.

514
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:54,458
Speaker 0: I mean it Shooting this gun pushes you backwards.

515
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:57,266
Speaker 0: It is so wonderful to fire that weapon.

516
00:35:57,326 --> 00:36:00,927
Speaker 1: yep another great thing They added to the game is that if you get the shotgun, right?

517
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:11,914
Speaker 1: If you fire this sometimes in when you're playing by on a commando right the way the hook because you can't jump But the way the hook works is you shoot the hook now You're swinging back and forth.

518
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:18,250
Speaker 1: if you reel in the hook because usually you're when you want to climb up You reel the hook in and then climb.

519
00:36:18,772 --> 00:36:27,649
Speaker 1: But if you reel in the hook and then you realize uh I can't go up And I want to go sideways and under me as a whole what do I do?

520
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:33,371
Speaker 1: You're just sort of screwed and a lot of situations you'll just be caught hanging there And you'll die.

521
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,082
Speaker 1: if you have the shotgun you can shoot it to start swinging again.

522
00:36:37,443 --> 00:36:38,526
Speaker 1: That is awesome.

523
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:39,890
Speaker 1: It is so awesome.

524
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:46,626
Speaker 1: It lets you get out of all these situations You would be stuck in before and it also gives you new options for getting through.

525
00:36:46,646 --> 00:36:47,970
Speaker 1: you know existing situation.

526
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:54,835
Speaker 1: I mean all the maps in the game except for the secrets are the same as the original maps 99%.

527
00:36:54,835 --> 00:37:08,216
Speaker 1: but because you have all these new abilities in terms of you know the Upgrades to the weapons and the shotgun and the grenades there are new ways to go through the levels that didn't exist before And it's a lot of fun,

528
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:13,114
Speaker 0: and you know let's talk in terms of just raw game playing What the game is like to play.

529
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:20,110
Speaker 0: it is difficult, but unlike a lot of games that I see lately This game has a really good difficulty curve.

530
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,347
Speaker 0: I mean Scott played through it on easy first, and I played through it on easy is a joke.

531
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:29,890
Speaker 0: basically I played through it on medium because I can beat bionic commando in about five minutes longer than it takes for a speedrun.

532
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:36,802
Speaker 0: I mean I. I played that game a lot as a kid yeah But the original NES one playing it on medium is the perfect.

533
00:37:37,243 --> 00:37:37,825
Speaker 0: perfect.

534
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:43,120
Speaker 0: if you were good at bionic commando Playing it on medium is absolutely perfect.

535
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,866
Speaker 0: It's the exact right difficulty level.

536
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:48,870
Speaker 1: it ramps it up beautifully Yeah, and on easy you're missing a lot of the game.

537
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,165
Speaker 1: I mean there are basically bosses that die in one bazooka shot, but normal.

538
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:54,690
Speaker 0: Scott was watching me playing medium.

539
00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:00,637
Speaker 0: I'm fighting like the big front-end loader like that giant thing the siege cannon thing yeah And he's.

540
00:38:00,818 --> 00:38:02,470
Speaker 0: he's watching me, and I blow up the trade.

541
00:38:03,012 --> 00:38:05,139
Speaker 0: And then he's like ah it didn't end.

542
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,671
Speaker 0: and then I had to do all this other stuff pulling bolts out that he just didn't Have to do.

543
00:38:09,193 --> 00:38:12,643
Speaker 1: yep easy basically just lets you win the game without having to do anything.

544
00:38:12,703 --> 00:38:17,719
Speaker 0: however if you have never played bionic commando You should probably play through the game on easy first.

545
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:21,534
Speaker 1: yep another thing that's added to the game is sort of like these VR training Rooms.

546
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:23,510
Speaker 1: all right, which is sort of basically?

547
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:29,490
Speaker 1: Can you pull off can you get from here to here quickly using the hook and it just it's sort of a test of your?

548
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,518
Speaker 0: Hook skills see this really draws into.

549
00:38:31,538 --> 00:38:50,730
Speaker 0: like what I like about this Megaman 9 and bionic commando Was that bionic commando was really innovative game and it had this mechanic that was never really explored After bionic commando until now and the game did a good job of forcing you to use it in clever ways But it did not kind of explore the full potential of all that was possible.

550
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:59,655
Speaker 0: And if you played bionic commando the original game enough You basically become as good as that game allowed you to be because there was nothing else fancy You could do.

551
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:00,849
Speaker 0: you were the most fancy, dude.

552
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:05,163
Speaker 1: It's as if it was pole vaulting and they just never raised the bar above.

553
00:39:05,183 --> 00:39:06,347
Speaker 1: you know a certain number of feet.

554
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:13,166
Speaker 0: I believe That this bionic commando raised the bar of that limited tool set of.

555
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:14,570
Speaker 0: you know grappling hook shot.

556
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:15,217
Speaker 0: You know all the things.

557
00:39:15,237 --> 00:39:18,282
Speaker 0: you get in the game To the absolute top.

558
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:19,530
Speaker 0: I think it is perfect.

559
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:30,229
Speaker 0: I think it the skill you could possibly attain by playing this game and practicing is The most that could be done gameplay wise with this tool set mm-hmm.

560
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:35,046
Speaker 1: I mean hard is balls hard, and then there's a gism.

561
00:39:35,147 --> 00:39:36,030
Speaker 1: super hard mode.

562
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,604
Speaker 0: I have not even deigned to click on super hard.

563
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:41,050
Speaker 1: I think I'll try it after the show.

564
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:41,794
Speaker 0: I can't even.

565
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:42,537
Speaker 1: I mean on hard.

566
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:44,266
Speaker 1: you died in front level one.

567
00:39:44,427 --> 00:39:45,709
Speaker 0: Yes me Oh my god.

568
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,177
Speaker 0: The thing is basically easy is easy.

569
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:52,790
Speaker 0: medium is the original bionic commando in terms of level of difficulty.

570
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:55,978
Speaker 0: in Hard the bad guys do things.

571
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:59,650
Speaker 0: that bionic commando bad guys never did before they run away.

572
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:01,022
Speaker 0: They shoot at you at angles.

573
00:40:01,062 --> 00:40:07,103
Speaker 0: They they're smart Super hard, I can't imagine I imagine the albatross and Hitler to show up right away and kill you.

574
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,948
Speaker 1: yeah, who knows what happens?

575
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:11,639
Speaker 1: but Anyway, the other things are added to.

576
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,290
Speaker 1: the game is a lot of secrets in the game.

577
00:40:13,552 --> 00:40:22,030
Speaker 1: A lot of the secrets are sort of just like blow up a wall Or you know pull off this amazing trick and go into an area you couldn't get into in the original game and stuff like that.

578
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:35,010
Speaker 1: And if you go and get these secrets, they're cool stuff, and there's weapon upgrades There's unlocks of secret VR rooms There's all sorts of secret stuff and the secrets are really hard to find like I'll think I found every secret in a level.

579
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,750
Speaker 1: I'll get to the end of the level to be like yeah, you found one out of four secrets.

580
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,995
Speaker 1: I'm like where the fuck were they?

581
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:39,698
Speaker 1: oh my god.

582
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:45,844
Speaker 1: Oh my god, so even if you beat the game it's fun to go look for the secrets because it's actually cool stuff in there.

583
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:48,942
Speaker 0: and What else can I say?

584
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:49,530
Speaker 0: the game is great.

585
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,244
Speaker 0: So we should talk about the other parts.

586
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:54,098
Speaker 0: because this game They didn't think they did what was perfect.

587
00:40:54,118 --> 00:41:00,861
Speaker 0: they didn't just take the game reskin and fix everything and make it this awesome game Did all those things it would have been if this was it.

588
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:01,824
Speaker 0: this is already like.

589
00:41:01,944 --> 00:41:04,246
Speaker 0: I would not have any less praise to say about it.

590
00:41:05,353 --> 00:41:08,893
Speaker 0: the game also has co-op and versus multiplayer.

591
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:10,176
Speaker 1: I so the co-op.

592
00:41:10,196 --> 00:41:17,050
Speaker 1: basically the way the cop works is Two people can play the single-player game at the same time together.

593
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,656
Speaker 0: It's implemented the possibly the best.

594
00:41:20,817 --> 00:41:24,225
Speaker 0: the only thing it is lacking is Network play.

595
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,560
Speaker 1: well at least if there is network play in the PC version.

596
00:41:28,062 --> 00:41:28,887
Speaker 1: I couldn't find it.

597
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:33,146
Speaker 1: there might be network play in the Xbox or ps3 versions I don't know, but play.

598
00:41:33,467 --> 00:41:35,996
Speaker 0: it was so enjoyable to play it.

599
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:41,152
Speaker 0: now the thing is we played it You know wondering what's this gonna be like and the normal levels are just super fun.

600
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:43,118
Speaker 0: There's no friendly fire into that BS.

601
00:41:43,178 --> 00:41:47,397
Speaker 0: It's just Absolutely hilariously amazingly fun to play this game on co-op.

602
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,858
Speaker 0: Scott and I are probably going to beat it on co-op on medium and then hard.

603
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:56,698
Speaker 0: but Then we got to the boss and we asked ourselves, so is it just gonna be the same boss or what?

604
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:57,160
Speaker 1: yeah?

605
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:09,679
Speaker 1: I'm like hey if this boss is the same as it is in single-player, and they didn't change it for co-op It's gonna be a joke cuz you'll throw the barrel at it to get it to fall down And then I'll shoot it with my Nintendo finger right away, and we'll kill it.

606
00:42:10,081 --> 00:42:13,715
Speaker 0: I don't think it's a spoiler to say they changed the bosses.

607
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:15,060
Speaker 0: It's totally awesome.

608
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had to work together in order to kill the boss and call it movie.

609
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:23,140
Speaker 1: both had to throw barrels You know with good timing and then they doubled its health.

610
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:27,500
Speaker 1: So he both had to shoot it if he wanted to kill it in the same number of tries.

611
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:28,990
Speaker 0: That's co-op game of the year.

612
00:42:29,191 --> 00:42:34,369
Speaker 1: Oh my god, definitely The problems with the co-op cuz not perfect right?

613
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:35,532
Speaker 1: is that the camera?

614
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:43,219
Speaker 1: you know of course if you get far away from the other Guy the camera starts to zoom out and sometimes it was a little disorienting, and I fell off the map.

615
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:44,142
Speaker 0: well So that was you.

616
00:42:44,263 --> 00:42:48,176
Speaker 0: you basically died left and right and you fell off the map also once.

617
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,280
Speaker 1: the other thing is that?

618
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:51,409
Speaker 1: There there are three modes.

619
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:57,376
Speaker 1: right if you get really far away from the other guy It doesn't want to zoom out anymore, so it splits the screen.

620
00:42:57,598 --> 00:43:03,860
Speaker 0: this is Brilliant because how many games like gauntlet back in the day, or how many you know and you try to have a co-op game?

621
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:14,658
Speaker 0: But it sucks because if you can get stuck because you can't leave the screen together or like one guy's pull another guy long Or it teleports you off, or you die or all these sorts of back together ways.

622
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,820
Speaker 1: now The thing is there are three choices for split-screen is horizontal vertical and auto right.

623
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,872
Speaker 1: Horizontal means whenever they split the screen they'll always split it horizontally.

624
00:43:24,913 --> 00:43:26,518
Speaker 1: vertical means they'll always split it vertically.

625
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:33,771
Speaker 1: auto means the game will decide on its own how to split it and sometimes it's okay, and sometimes it's not.

626
00:43:34,132 --> 00:43:42,276
Speaker 1: like you'll be trying to go up and Sometimes you get a horizontal split And it's like you can't see what's above and below you and it's not so great.

627
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:42,778
Speaker 0: see the same.

628
00:43:42,798 --> 00:43:49,400
Speaker 1: sometimes You'll be wanting to go from left to right, but you have a vertical split So you'll be basically having being forced to jump into mystery.

629
00:43:49,601 --> 00:43:53,800
Speaker 0: I might have the bias that I basically have the game memorized from from when I was a kid.

630
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't have the game memorized so well.

631
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,527
Speaker 1: You know I tried to jump to the right and I fell in a hole forgetting it was there But it didn't bother me at all and it was.

632
00:44:00,547 --> 00:44:03,598
Speaker 0: it was such a fluid transition that I just kept playing.

633
00:44:03,638 --> 00:44:11,888
Speaker 1: it is a pretty fluid transition But you know I think really just when you're playing the co-op and you're getting far away from the other guy You have to concentrate a little bit more.

634
00:44:11,948 --> 00:44:14,800
Speaker 0: at the same time playing the co-op is definitely.

635
00:44:15,665 --> 00:44:18,104
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be fun If that was your first time through the game.

636
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:24,820
Speaker 0: playing co-op is definitely for two people who are similarly skilled or good at the game At least yeah.

637
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:26,980
Speaker 0: And then you're kind of going through it for this additional.

638
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:38,800
Speaker 1: it's like if someone has never played the game before played it co-op with like VRM like you just leave you behind and You just sort of be stumbling along dying and then you would die completely and the other person would go on to beat the game.

639
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,202
Speaker 0: It's just.

640
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,434
Speaker 0: it's really really fun and well implemented.

641
00:44:41,655 --> 00:44:45,433
Speaker 0: yep, so Multiplayer versus one you can pick characters.

642
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:46,860
Speaker 0: you can play as generalissimo kilt.

643
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:52,660
Speaker 1: There's four characters and Gottfried is kilt Gottfried Super Joe, and you know Spencer, right?

644
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:58,758
Speaker 1: And there are three modes deathmatch mode, which is who gets the most frags in the time limit, right?

645
00:44:58,778 --> 00:44:59,400
Speaker 0: It's really fun.

646
00:45:00,141 --> 00:45:01,746
Speaker 0: Well, I mean what else can I say right?

647
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:03,652
Speaker 1: or who gets ex frags first or whatever?

648
00:45:03,973 --> 00:45:05,879
Speaker 1: then there's survival mode which is?

649
00:45:06,802 --> 00:45:07,324
Speaker 1: Who get?

650
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:08,147
Speaker 1: who can live?

651
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:10,295
Speaker 1: who can you know not die five times?

652
00:45:10,355 --> 00:45:11,620
Speaker 1: who could not die ten times?

653
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,310
Speaker 1: it's it's Smash Brothers stock and you know.

654
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:20,840
Speaker 1: basically the way it works is a bunch of maps to choose from and Everyone has a hook and a gun normal just buying a commando weapons.

655
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,868
Speaker 0: You can turn items and weapons on and on.

656
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:24,514
Speaker 1: you can turn items and weapons on and off.

657
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:34,384
Speaker 1: the way that works is these items Parachute themselves into the game and you have to hook them to get them and you have and can also turn that off if you Can just grab them.

658
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:35,789
Speaker 1: yep, you have a choice of.

659
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:42,648
Speaker 1: you know either touch an item to pick it up or use the hook to pick it up and You get these items and you can get shields.

660
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:46,100
Speaker 1: you can get you know all the different weapons in the game.

661
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:46,869
Speaker 1: You can get health.

662
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:55,395
Speaker 1: you can get all this stuff and all the items you pick up have ammo and Like Super Joe has more ammo and he does a little.

663
00:45:55,455 --> 00:45:58,737
Speaker 1: he does average damage but he does less health.

664
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:05,510
Speaker 1: and Kilt has not so much ammo, but he does a lot of damage and he has okay health you know and all the care.

665
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:13,499
Speaker 1: and you know Spencer's even across the board and so you'll pick up a bazooka, but you only have like two or three shots, and then you don't have it anymore.

666
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:16,434
Speaker 1: you take a hook another weapon and It's really good.

667
00:46:17,302 --> 00:46:21,740
Speaker 1: Now the best thing about the multiplayer mode is they don't touch the floor mode.

668
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:23,729
Speaker 0: It is remember when you were a kid.

669
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:24,975
Speaker 0: don't touch the carpet.

670
00:46:24,995 --> 00:46:25,980
Speaker 0: the carpet is hot lava.

671
00:46:26,922 --> 00:46:28,999
Speaker 0: That's what this is and you don't take damage.

672
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:31,610
Speaker 0: It's just a kind of grabbing.

673
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:41,159
Speaker 0: if you play the other game any any of the other modes It's basically a test of using the weapons properly and maneuvering well enough to use the weapons properly and get the items.

674
00:46:41,942 --> 00:46:48,108
Speaker 0: Playing in this other mode reminds me a lot of ricochet the old half-life 1 mod Which I love and we should play as a forum.

675
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:49,092
Speaker 1: we played it.

676
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:50,840
Speaker 1: I was playing it a few weeks ago.

677
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,986
Speaker 0: I know we got to play it some more cuz.

678
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:52,629
Speaker 0: that game is great.

679
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,213
Speaker 1: It is great.

680
00:46:53,534 --> 00:46:54,560
Speaker 0: It's a lot like that.

681
00:46:54,701 --> 00:46:56,100
Speaker 0: It's really really fun.

682
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:03,501
Speaker 0: It's all about grappling skill and posturing and rhythm And I can't imagine how great that'll be with four people based on the way It works.

683
00:47:03,581 --> 00:47:11,733
Speaker 0: everyone has the regular gun everyone has a grappling hook and grenades and you need each other and try to knock each other Back and make the other guy touch the ground while not touching.

684
00:47:11,753 --> 00:47:13,200
Speaker 1: no one actually takes damage.

685
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,285
Speaker 1: You're just trying to get.

686
00:47:14,305 --> 00:47:17,920
Speaker 1: I already said you're just trying to get the other guy to fall off the mat.

687
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:21,112
Speaker 0: I already said that too, so it's kind of like Smash Brothers.

688
00:47:21,393 --> 00:47:23,220
Speaker 0: It is it's real fun.

689
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,227
Speaker 0: The only problem is well.

690
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:28,760
Speaker 0: It wasn't really a problem because the game got into a stalemate for a little while.

691
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,894
Speaker 0: But you eventually get bored.

692
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:34,892
Speaker 0: then it doesn't stalemate And I don't think it can stalemate if you have more than two right.

693
00:47:34,912 --> 00:47:35,736
Speaker 1: we had two people.

694
00:47:35,776 --> 00:47:43,240
Speaker 1: so what happened is me and rim Are facing each other right and it's pretty much shoot shoot shoot, and then you can use your hook to block shots.

695
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,570
Speaker 1: So you're using the hook to block all the shots.

696
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:47,640
Speaker 1: everyone was shooting and blocking everything course.

697
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:58,142
Speaker 0: then I just kind of swung around and started fighting again, and right I discovered there is a Almost unbeatable strategy of sitting in this one platform and one of the maps and just shooting in either direction and not letting Scott Get up.

698
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:01,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, it worked real well for like three games in a row.

699
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:02,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's it.

700
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:06,267
Speaker 1: basically you know if you do a certain thing It's really hard for the other person to make a comeback.

701
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:11,929
Speaker 0: the thing is it's still really fun because much like how tag or Marco I guess I could have waited it out.

702
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:14,100
Speaker 0: Here's an example Marco Polo.

703
00:48:15,002 --> 00:48:18,539
Speaker 0: The best strategy is to always stay as far away from the guys possible.

704
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:20,866
Speaker 0: duh But that's not fun.

705
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:24,622
Speaker 0: you want to show off the people who have the most fun playing Marco Polo.

706
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:29,558
Speaker 0: are the people who are like standing right behind the guy like holding their hands in front of him and splashing?

707
00:48:29,578 --> 00:48:32,780
Speaker 0: yeah So uh it's the same deal here.

708
00:48:33,822 --> 00:48:34,805
Speaker 0: You start showing off.

709
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:38,236
Speaker 0: you start like hanging down by the spike standing right on the edge.

710
00:48:38,296 --> 00:48:46,587
Speaker 0: look at me look at me look at Me and that makes the game great, and then if you play with I don't know three or four people oh My god, this will never get old.

711
00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:50,220
Speaker 1: we've never played it with more than two people cuz we've only played it once today.

712
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,620
Speaker 1: That was it, but I can imagine with three or four people that multiplayer has got to be some hot shit.

713
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,947
Speaker 0: This was just seriously the best game.

714
00:48:57,067 --> 00:49:01,320
Speaker 0: I've played since portal, and I I can't even pretend to be exaggerating.

715
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,304
Speaker 1: It's so cheap.

716
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:02,967
Speaker 1: It's $15 to the PC.

717
00:49:02,987 --> 00:49:07,320
Speaker 1: I think it's $10 in the Xbox dollars.

718
00:49:08,766 --> 00:49:11,387
Speaker 1: Yeah 15 isn't that weird.

719
00:49:11,487 --> 00:49:12,851
Speaker 1: portal was also this great game.

720
00:49:12,871 --> 00:49:15,699
Speaker 1: didn't portal on its own cost like $20 or something like that?

721
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:16,204
Speaker 0: I don't.

722
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:24,921
Speaker 1: portal was a better game Yeah, but I'm saying is that look at this the hit games the big games now $15.

723
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:27,672
Speaker 0: it's just the production values are so high.

724
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:35,380
Speaker 0: I mean usually when I pay $15 for a game I expect something not so great or at least I expect something great that is not polished or not professional looking.

725
00:49:36,024 --> 00:49:40,664
Speaker 0: This game is so great and also You know I hate this It's not a charity.

726
00:49:40,725 --> 00:49:43,760
Speaker 0: don't buy games just to support the gaming industry or whatever.

727
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:47,455
Speaker 0: But if more people buy this game they might make more games like this.

728
00:49:47,596 --> 00:49:47,757
Speaker 1: Well.

729
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:48,500
Speaker 1: They're making great.

730
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:52,317
Speaker 1: They're making a 3d next-gen bionic commando, and I'm 50/50 on that.

731
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,286
Speaker 1: I don't know what to think about.

732
00:49:54,346 --> 00:49:56,215
Speaker 0: I've watched all the trailers.

733
00:49:56,255 --> 00:49:57,400
Speaker 1: the controls are really bad.

734
00:49:58,485 --> 00:49:59,030
Speaker 1: From who?

735
00:49:59,272 --> 00:49:59,999
Speaker 1: someone who played it?

736
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,562
Speaker 0: Yeah, I kotaku will see because I watched all the trailers And it.

737
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:09,899
Speaker 0: it didn't look like it was necessarily bad And it could be good, and they've got great voice actors and a lot of talent lined up.

738
00:50:11,061 --> 00:50:15,797
Speaker 0: I'm just I'm 50/50, but it has potential and I will buy it and try it for what?

739
00:50:16,399 --> 00:50:18,849
Speaker 0: well I'll probably play it on someone else's Xbox.

740
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:19,953
Speaker 0: Uh-huh all right.

741
00:50:20,174 --> 00:50:20,957
Speaker 0: I gotta try it.

742
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:21,760
Speaker 0: It's bionic man.

743
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,449
Speaker 1: I don't know is that gonna come up for the PC or not.

744
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:24,093
Speaker 1: It's a good question.

745
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:25,440
Speaker 0: I just buy an Xbox.

746
00:50:25,766 --> 00:50:26,560
Speaker 0: It's getting to that point.

747
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,737
Speaker 1: Well, I was thinking I was gonna wait till we get HDTV and then get an Xbox for which?

748
00:50:30,797 --> 00:50:31,560
Speaker 0: but we gotta buy a house.

749
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:40,223
Speaker 1: Sorry Xbox 3 because the Xbox 360 is actually the Xbox 2.

750
00:50:40,223 --> 00:50:45,178
Speaker 0: Alright, so we have to buy a house Then we have to buy an HDTV to put in that house, and then I will buy an Xbox.
