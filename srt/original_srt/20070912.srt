1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,216
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday September 12th.

2
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:12,259
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,568
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:19,108
Speaker 1: We review superspy by Matt kint.

5
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:30,355
Speaker 1: Let's do this All right, so yesterday.

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,699
Speaker 1: We didn't do a normal show.

7
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:35,870
Speaker 0: we did the special show because Scott decided to go see some circuses.

8
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,319
Speaker 0: No after his bread.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,973
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, that kind of circus Yeah, I guess what.

10
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:45,610
Speaker 0: when have I ever used the word circus in any context other than bread and circuses?

11
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:49,648
Speaker 1: when you're talking about trapezes and clowns?

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,210
Speaker 0: When was the last time I talked about those things?

13
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,261
Speaker 1: Anyway, I went to see the baseball.

14
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:05,650
Speaker 1: it was a pretty bad baseball But I'm glad I went because the way it works is think first of all the game.

15
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:08,470
Speaker 1: We weren't sure if it was gonna rain out cuz it was pretty rainy.

16
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:11,318
Speaker 0: Scott's complaining to me over the the Gmail.

17
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:13,564
Speaker 0: just uh I don't want to show up.

18
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:18,270
Speaker 0: if it's gonna get rained out and my dad Doesn't show up cuz then I'm stuck and I have to take a crap train home.

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:26,962
Speaker 0: But if it doesn't get rained out, but I don't go then I don't get to go to another game, but if I do go Yeah, so I'm glad I did go because it didn't rain out.

20
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:36,318
Speaker 1: in fact pretty much as soon as the game started It was close to starting it stopped raining, and it didn't rain at all the whole game, and they played and But they got killed.

21
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:40,628
Speaker 1: it was not pleasant and We went home before the game was all the way.

22
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:41,714
Speaker 1: well We didn't go home.

23
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:46,289
Speaker 1: you went home before the official end of the game But when we left it was over.

24
00:01:47,713 --> 00:01:50,450
Speaker 0: I do however note that there's one instance where?

25
00:01:51,190 --> 00:02:07,765
Speaker 0: We were at a sporting event you me and a few other of our friends or in this case I can't refer to them as friends, but maybe dumbasses And the team the home team we were rooting for was down By a lot and there was like a minute left of play, and it was obviously over.

26
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:09,509
Speaker 0: so everybody walks out.

27
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,858
Speaker 0: Yeah, screw this.

28
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:11,884
Speaker 0: They're not gonna win.

29
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:18,199
Speaker 0: It's over and If I'm second left correctly with two seconds left They tied it up.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,000
Speaker 0: they tied it up And they wouldn't over time and they won it over time.

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,970
Speaker 1: everyone was crazy for like ten minutes.

32
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:24,880
Speaker 0: I still have the ticket in my wallet.

33
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:30,262
Speaker 1: I still have the ticket in my room But anyway, oh it also one time.

34
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:41,910
Speaker 1: I went to a Mets game must have been like 99 I think and it was like against the Phillies and Kurt Schilling was pitching and it was raining and The game was freaking delayed for like an hour or two because of the rain.

35
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,496
Speaker 1: but then they eventually played.

36
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:46,629
Speaker 1: but it was getting so late that we went home plus the Mets were losing.

37
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:49,493
Speaker 1: and Then on the way home.

38
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,181
Speaker 1: We listen to the radio and they came back.

39
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:56,169
Speaker 0: see it's weird because I mean you'd think oh I want to see my team win.

40
00:02:56,691 --> 00:03:10,829
Speaker 0: But it's kind of like what happens in the count of Monte Cristo where if you go to see a sporting event and the team You're rooting for isn't just losing but getting their asses handed to them you kind of you're brought down to the lowest of the low the most despair you can get out of a sporting event.

41
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:15,002
Speaker 0: and Then if they turn it around and win it, it's the best thing ever.

42
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:18,494
Speaker 0: because now it's not just from neutral to win It's lose to win.

43
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:19,457
Speaker 0: That's an extra step.

44
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:20,461
Speaker 0: That's like double yelling.

45
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,363
Speaker 1: It's all relative.

46
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:30,802
Speaker 0: It's all relative it is But unrelated to that entirely Emily and I finally got our own Etymotic 6i isolator earbuds.

47
00:03:31,184 --> 00:03:32,450
Speaker 1: Oh now you will not go deaf.

48
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:38,889
Speaker 0: So well, I wouldn't have anyway because master Keaton is actually very quiet and rarely even has background music.

49
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:41,640
Speaker 1: That's true But at least now you can hear master Keaton.

50
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:53,267
Speaker 0: when there's crying babies or Trains going by or subways It's usually loud indignant woman on a cell phone talking about something that happened to her recently that made her indignant.

51
00:03:53,508 --> 00:04:07,230
Speaker 0: Yep or Every morning if I depending on its there's always at least one old man Who took a peak train and tries to pay with his old man fair and the conductor always explains the same monotone?

52
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:15,037
Speaker 0: There's no such thing as an old man fair on the peak train and the old man says I've been riding this train for 20 Years, you don't you're not the boss of me.

53
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:17,748
Speaker 0: and the conductor says yeah pay me or I'm calling the police.

54
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:23,470
Speaker 1: Well today Connecticut train into the city because I was you know in Connecticut after the game.

55
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:29,409
Speaker 1: Oh the Connecticut trains the ones that have the overhead lines Yeah, but the because the Connecticut people have a different train etiquette.

56
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,001
Speaker 1: So they were all talky as opposed to the Hudson line.

57
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,693
Speaker 1: people which are all quiet on the morning train Like they should be.

58
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,128
Speaker 0: the Harlem line was actually kind of weird the few times I took that in.

59
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:42,250
Speaker 1: but yeah Yeah, it's funny how the different train lines all have different etiquette.

60
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,076
Speaker 1: It's like the Connecticut people are all chatty.

61
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:46,003
Speaker 1: the new up upstate New York.

62
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:48,170
Speaker 1: People are all quiet and you know tired.

63
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:56,582
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Hudson line serious business is serious business though granted now that school started a lot of people are taking that train for school like in the Bronx.

64
00:04:56,662 --> 00:05:08,299
Speaker 0: on the train I take mm-hmm and Everyday there's two factions punk kids talking to each other about their pokemons in business and Businessmen who are super pissed off at them for making noise.

65
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,907
Speaker 1: Why don't those kids take the subway or the bus is cheaper.

66
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:13,095
Speaker 0: Ah Not depends.

67
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:17,050
Speaker 0: It's a lot faster to take the metro north and there's a city ticket thing where it's like three bucks.

68
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:18,481
Speaker 1: Ah, there you go.

69
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:19,510
Speaker 1: All right.

70
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:21,252
Speaker 1: So how?

71
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:21,875
Speaker 1: those headphones?

72
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:23,100
Speaker 0: they're really great.

73
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, I said I didn't have to listen to any of that business.

74
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:26,592
Speaker 1: So I got.

75
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,117
Speaker 1: so my I've been.

76
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:29,341
Speaker 1: you know, we need to do the show.

77
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:31,970
Speaker 1: we wear headphones that we can hear ourselves talk.

78
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:32,975
Speaker 1: I don't know why we do that.

79
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:33,919
Speaker 0: Well, we used to not.

80
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,330
Speaker 0: I mean, well, I always did because early in the days You know, we didn't have a compressor way back or anything.

81
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:55,550
Speaker 0: we just had our little mixer and I had my little things plugged into it and I thought I was using it all cool and I knew about audio and I always saw that, you know I wore the headphones like everyone does on TV or when you see someone in a recording studio and I'd hear myself talk and I'd hear Scott talk and I try to use that to you know.

82
00:05:55,791 --> 00:06:08,710
Speaker 0: Make the audio levels good, but Scott because he didn't have headphones on Couldn't react to things the way I did so I always had to fiddle with his volume And once I got him a pair of headphones, I didn't have to fiddle with his volume anymore.

83
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:12,250
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I don't conscious the thing about wearing headphones and recording a podcast.

84
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:25,530
Speaker 1: I think it's actually essential because even though I don't consciously listen in the headphones to try to hear things or anything like that Just having them on has this sort of subconscious effect on how I talk and how we do the show.

85
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,889
Speaker 1: And I think if we did the show without the headphones then did the same show again with the headphones You would notice a big difference.

86
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, well part of it is just you hear the relative like if suddenly your voice sounds really loud in yours.

87
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,974
Speaker 0: You know that huh?

88
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:39,202
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm a little too close to the microphone.

89
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:41,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I'm pulling a Dave Riley here.

90
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,595
Speaker 1: The thing is you can't use.

91
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:44,584
Speaker 1: I would use my etymotics, but they can't.

92
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,970
Speaker 1: they don't have volume control on them.

93
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:54,924
Speaker 0: The only volume control is up with me in the little mixer setup and Partly because we use a splitter because it's a tiny little mixer.

94
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,390
Speaker 0: The volume is all the way up.

95
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:58,109
Speaker 0: Yeah all the way up.

96
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:04,974
Speaker 1: so I had these cheap like 15 $20 Radio Shack things that is separate volume for left and right and they They haven't been working.

97
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:10,730
Speaker 0: So well one that that's kind of crappy anyway, yeah, and now I'm using these free headphones.

98
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:14,630
Speaker 1: We got with the Marantz recorder thing and they also suck.

99
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,976
Speaker 1: But at least they work because the Radio Shack ones are broken for the longest time and it's kind of weird to actually have Working headphones now.

100
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,706
Speaker 1: I can I can hear things on my right ear.

101
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:25,098
Speaker 0: It's strange Yeah, but one thing I want to say.

102
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,765
Speaker 0: this comes up a lot in the forums and it comes up every now and then in the show.

103
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:41,402
Speaker 0: but if you listen to iPods or anything or podcasts and I imagine you listen to podcasts at least one or two and You're ever in places where there's background noise get a pair of etymotic 6i isolators or

104
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:46,699
Speaker 1: at least some sort of isolation or noise cancelling headphones that actually work because

105
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,385
Speaker 0: otherwise you're gonna lose your hearing pretty quick

106
00:07:48,546 --> 00:07:53,330
Speaker 1: or you're not gonna be able to hear what you're Listening to because you you know, you don't want to turn the volume up because it'll hurt your hearing.

107
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,990
Speaker 1: So you you force yourself to keep the volume low so you don't hurt your hearing.

108
00:07:57,312 --> 00:08:03,641
Speaker 1: but now this background noise and you can't hear what's going on because using the The the buds that came with your iPod or something, right?

109
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:04,344
Speaker 0: But enough of that.

110
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:10,090
Speaker 0: it is in fact anime night Oh man's animes and I don't know there wasn't so much anime news.

111
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:14,382
Speaker 1: You know the con seasons over everyone made their big announcements.

112
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:21,769
Speaker 1: you're not gonna get big announcements again for many months you know, there's gonna be a new anime season and then Then we'll get a bunch more news.

113
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:31,209
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean on one hand the one news I saw that it was I thought was funny was that Tetsu Ohara is gonna do a children's anime called a morino senshi bono alone.

114
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:42,464
Speaker 0: Tetsu Ohara for those of you who are unaware is the man who created fist of the something something Yeah, something like that, yeah.

115
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,175
Speaker 1: So that's pretty crazy.

116
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:48,026
Speaker 0: problem is all I can say about that is hahaha.

117
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:48,910
Speaker 0: Look it's happening.

118
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:52,890
Speaker 1: I know it's always funny when someone doesn't work that you like you don't expect them to do.

119
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,047
Speaker 1: You know, like if someone is known for making like you like Takashi Miike made like mr.

120
00:08:58,107 --> 00:08:59,353
Speaker 1: Rogers, you know It's like.

121
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:00,722
Speaker 0: I know exactly that would go.

122
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:07,830
Speaker 0: it would start with mister mr Rogers pissing on the corpse of his dead mother maybe and then the yakuza would come and there'd be a fight in the street.

123
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:12,050
Speaker 0: It's like it's gonna be all like realistic and a bunch of people would have died and it'd be really sad.

124
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:21,029
Speaker 1: Well, it's like when Jim Carrey, you know He's known for his crazy comedies and then he tried to make a non crazy comedy people were like what and then it was Actually kind of okay and good, you know some of it.

125
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:28,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, well when I saw eternal sunshine all I could think is god damn Why didn't he tell us he was an actor before and I didn't like that one that much?

126
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,194
Speaker 1: I think it was overrated.

127
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:30,903
Speaker 1: I mean it wasn't bad, but I think it was overrated.

128
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,090
Speaker 1: I'm talking like Truman show.

129
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,524
Speaker 0: It was overrated compared to the hype but as a movie it was badass.

130
00:09:35,564 --> 00:09:36,448
Speaker 1: It wasn't badass.

131
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:36,910
Speaker 1: It was good.

132
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,698
Speaker 1: I don't think it's better.

133
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,845
Speaker 0: It's better than time cop.

134
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:40,570
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

135
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:54,210
Speaker 1: But yeah, well, I really think it's always interesting when someone who is known for making You know art in a particular style or genre breaks from that and tries to do something else.

136
00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:01,850
Speaker 1: And that's really when you can tell if they actually have artistic talent or not Or if they're just a one-trick pony who is you know, perfected one thing.

137
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:08,068
Speaker 0: We've seen that in sports when Someone we might all remember tried to play a different sport than he was used to.

138
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:09,764
Speaker 1: yeah Think about it's really hard.

139
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:10,250
Speaker 1: in sports.

140

148
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:47,970

00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:51,443
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not but that's not you know, a professional sport.

00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:49,370
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna read straight up here The genie on anime production.

169
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:59,826
Speaker 0: LDC laserdisc subsidiary before pioneers sold it to Dentsu in July of 2003 really?

170
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:00,849
Speaker 1: How do you spell Dentsu?

171
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,399
Speaker 0: Dntsu, it's not then setsu which you were probably thinking.

172
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe you know what I read.

173
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,589
Speaker 1: so they say Ken before it.

174
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:28,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, no fungus ambition Right, so, uh, the Mitsubishi conglomerates D rights Subsidiary then entered a joint venture with Dentsu to acquire a 34% equity stake in genie on entertainment in June of 2006. with Mitsubishi's divestment genie on is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Dentsu.

175
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:31,158
Speaker 0: again It goes on with.

176
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:37,884
Speaker 0: there's another percentage and a couple more company names like sojits wait Let me translate works, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of sojits.

177
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,109
Speaker 1: I think I can translate this.

178
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,818
Speaker 1: you ready I can translate it into two sentences.

179
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:41,562
Speaker 0: Oh, can you now?

180
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:48,210
Speaker 1: Yep number one Japanese business is complicated, you know more complicated than American business.

181
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,422
Speaker 0: It's no more complicated than the car industry perhaps.

182
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:53,008
Speaker 1: Yeah his sentence number two.

183
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:53,349
Speaker 1: You ready?

184
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,524
Speaker 1: Genie on is not doing so.

185
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:58,881
Speaker 0: well See, maybe that wouldn't have been the case.

186
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:01,070
Speaker 0: He could have said oh, it was just a business gobbledygook.

187
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,846
Speaker 0: But as part of this merger genie on did lay off like 20% of its workforce.

188
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:08,736
Speaker 0: So like five guys yeah, really it's.

189
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:22,522
Speaker 1: it's a TV is sort of conglomerating a lot of the anime industry into itself and you know, it's pretty much like a TV and funimation are going big and Media blasters kinda, you

190
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:30,810
Speaker 0: know, it's weird But it seems like back and when I was at RIT in the early days when I was in high school Who put out an anime who made an anime company wise?

191
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,016
Speaker 0: Mattered a lot to me because I saw trends like.

192
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:43,222
Speaker 0: it seemed like anything that said Bandai or pioneer was good But nowadays for a long time now Really been ignoring that and I care a lot more about who directed the anime.

193
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:45,710
Speaker 1: That's what you get when you learn stuff.

194
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:57,172
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, plus it doesn't you know, but ADV is still known for doing all the bouncy booby animes and you know, it's Yeah, also the manga companies like viz and you know It's really.

195
00:13:57,232 --> 00:14:08,910
Speaker 1: it's the viz funimation combination is is rocking everyone's boat because they have all the big Licenses and they have the big partnerships with the Japanese companies and it's really tough to beat the Shonen jumps.

196
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:13,229
Speaker 0: Hey Yeah, though what I'm curious about?

197
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:24,390
Speaker 0: Dave Riley a fast karate for the gentleman has been called a man with a sexy voice many times in the past and I remember At one point on their show someone said that he could read pretty much anything and it would sound sexy.

198
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:27,530
Speaker 0: So my challenge to him, I'm throwing the glove.

199
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:31,125
Speaker 0: I want you to read this on your show in a cell.

200
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:34,825
Speaker 0: the boys the business This whole business talk gobbledygook.

201
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:37,880
Speaker 1: I want to hear it You know, I really don't care.

202
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,730
Speaker 1: I want to hear think about it.

203
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,011
Speaker 0: I don't.

204
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:46,250
Speaker 0: I'm fundamentally opposed the idea of playing, you know podcast promos or podcast networks or anything like that.

205
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:53,381
Speaker 0: But I kind of like Dave and Joel and that's the only way I can promote them without actually Promoting them is bring them up in tangential kind of way.

206
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,490
Speaker 1: All right, can I can I do a news now?

207
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,714
Speaker 0: I guess so.

208
00:14:56,794 --> 00:15:00,185
Speaker 1: digital manga publishing who is a manga publisher in the US?

209
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:05,550
Speaker 1: and they publish a few things that are cool Like they publish those robot anthologies and some stuff like that, right?

210
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:07,294
Speaker 1: They have a new.

211
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:20,370
Speaker 1: they did they licensed a bunch more manga, right and in the agreement for licenses for these manga They have agreed with the Japanese publishers to put the logos of the Japanese publishers on the manga.

212
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,137
Speaker 0: Prominently, this is a good thing.

213
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:25,384
Speaker 1: This is this is really strange too.

214
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:32,690
Speaker 1: Cuz I mean like you look at Something like viz right and they put the viz logo all big and they put they put the shonen jump thing on there, too.

215
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,640
Speaker 1: But that's because that's actually a brand they use in the US.

216
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,907
Speaker 1: but they don't put like shoe Asia on there.

217
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:43,569
Speaker 1: or you know No one puts like katakawa or anything on there on their animes or anything like that.

218
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,012
Speaker 1: You know It's it's the Japanese Companies.

219
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:51,349
Speaker 1: the publishers over there are sort of kept a secret from us and only like the uber fans know what they are.

220
00:15:51,933 --> 00:16:09,741
Speaker 1: And I think that if more Japanese companies Force the American companies to put the Japanese publisher logos on their manga People will start to see you know like a Tokyo pop that has one logo and then a digital manga publishing book that has the same logo on it and it's like People begin to realize.

221
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:19,943
Speaker 1: Oh and then they'll start to buy, you know, like if I see the you know, the Big shonen spirit logo on books over here.

222
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:20,605
Speaker 1: I'm like, aha.

223
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:24,434
Speaker 0: I know I want that book And then we do that.

224
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:27,225
Speaker 0: now we go to like in Okuniya and you just tell by the logo.

225
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:28,510
Speaker 0: I want that wall.

226
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want that wall desperately.

227
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:37,120
Speaker 1: that's one thing that actually American comics and Japanese comics sort of have in common.

228
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,730
Speaker 1: is that the the publisher or at least the imprint?

229
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,928
Speaker 1: You know the the late the label on the book that says who who made it?

230
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,741
Speaker 1: Sort of tells you something about what the book's gonna be.

231
00:16:45,802 --> 00:17:00,230
Speaker 1: if something says shonen jump You can be pretty sure it contains a story about kids or at least younger people with some sort of magical or supernatural Powers usually with some sort of fighting in maybe not the physical sense, but some sort of fighting.

232
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:07,678
Speaker 1: You know whether it's Death Note or One Piece or Naruto and you can tell if something says You know vertigo on it in the u.s.

233
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:15,986
Speaker 1: That it's gonna be some sort of serious adult possibly gory sort of drama like like an HBO television series in comic form.

234
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:26,888
Speaker 1: so Nowadays because we have in the manga in the u.s Like Tokyo pop and viz and whoever they just license as much manga as they can and they put their label on all of it.

235
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,798
Speaker 1: Just cuz something says viz doesn't mean you're gonna like it.

236
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:31,081
Speaker 1: just cuz sentence says Tokyo pop.

237
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:33,689
Speaker 1: that tells you nothing about the manga itself.

238
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:40,249
Speaker 1: and While I sorta on the one hand I'm sort of against the genre publisher link up.

239
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:51,573
Speaker 1: It is kind of useful from a purchasing perspective and being able to tell What you might also like and you might miss out on some things and you also might you know Get some things you don't want.

240
00:17:52,134 --> 00:18:04,570
Speaker 1: so if we get the Japanese labeling which is sort of tied to genre in a way Then it'll be easier for Americans who pay attention to it to purchase manga they want and avoid manga.

241
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,053
Speaker 1: They don't want because knowing something is published by Tokyo pop tells you nothing.

242
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,420
Speaker 0: things of the day.

243
00:18:17,904 --> 00:18:19,900
Speaker 0: So this probably would have been better yesterday.

244
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,080
Speaker 0: But Scott was at the baseball game and we put up a special and I guess it's an amount till today.

245
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,320
Speaker 1: So you couldn't have done it yesterday.

246
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:30,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I could have done it yesterday by traveling back in time or by doing it next Tuesday.

247
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:33,268
Speaker 0: All right, but you know how.

248
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:37,259
Speaker 0: Team Fortress 2 the game that I've waited for for about a decade.

249
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,264
Speaker 1: Yeah It's coming We're gonna play on Monday.

250
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:43,740
Speaker 1: that I already pre-loaded on my computer just now that I could activate if I just knew some bits.

251
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:45,024
Speaker 0: Game that's coming.

252
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:54,851
Speaker 0: Well, they've been doing a marketing campaign where they've been releasing one by one Videos entitled meet the and then the name of one of the classes from the game It started with.

253
00:18:54,871 --> 00:19:01,998
Speaker 1: so if it was World of Warcraft It would be like meet the paladin meet the night meet the wizard and the first one is still the best one.

254
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:02,760
Speaker 0: meet the heavy.

255
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,711
Speaker 0: Yeah, I am heavy weapons guy.

256
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:06,340
Speaker 1: Can you name all the classes without looking?

257
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,740
Speaker 0: Honestly, I can name them all in weapons factory, but they're almost the same, you know, there's heavy weapons guy.

258
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's marine whatever the soldier but a same class.

259
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:17,991

Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the medic or the nurse.

269
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:38,714

Speaker 1: I don't remember.

272
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:44,436
Speaker 0: I actually played more weapons factory than I did any other capture the flag game ever.

273
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:46,666
Speaker 1: I Capture the flag.

274
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:49,560
Speaker 1: I never really play tribes to have more than most capture the flag.

275
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:50,884
Speaker 0: You never played any like.

276
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:52,189
Speaker 1: TFC is a big.

277
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:53,011
Speaker 1: yeah.

278
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:55,620
Speaker 1: when I played TFC I mostly played the hunted.

279
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,369
Speaker 1: I didn't really well the VIP mode.

280
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:02,210
Speaker 0: TFC was the weakest of all the team fortresses Yeah, but the VIP mode was the strongest mode.

281
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:04,760
Speaker 1: So I never played the capture the flag.

282
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:09,095
Speaker 0: But anyway, I digress there very much plus I was the best VIP.

283
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:09,597
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

284
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:10,219
Speaker 1: I always made it.

285
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:12,000
Speaker 0: The third one of these is out.

286
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:26,420
Speaker 0: it is meet the engineer and all I'd really like to say is that the best part of this video is When he pauses waiting for his rockets to land and then there's just this very kind of Happy contented smile as he hears them explode in the distance.

287
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,499
Speaker 1: The only thing I say about this video is that it makes me sad that some 3d model can play the guitar better than me.

288
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:38,880
Speaker 0: These things are worth watching even if you're not a video gamer or a PC gamer at all.

289
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,150
Speaker 1: Well, it'll also make you buy the game.

290
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,220
Speaker 1: So you might not want to watch of course the game.

291
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,051
Speaker 1: You can buy it now for $45 on Steam.

292
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:46,674
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

293
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:48,220
Speaker 1: Is it like the best deal of the century?

294
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is gonna be probably one of these seminal works of PC gaming.

295
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:56,942
Speaker 1: Yeah I have a feeling that Monday will take the day I remember.

296
00:20:57,043 --> 00:21:03,310
Speaker 0: if this game doesn't live up to what we're all making it out to be I imagine it's gonna be like the greatest track.

297
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,119
Speaker 1: There was just a thing online today like the 10 flat to.

298
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:07,925
Speaker 1: It was like.

299
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:10,334
Speaker 1: it was like the 10 flops in gaming and they were like.

300
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:15,536
Speaker 1: these are games that were you know hyped up but then they flopped like and they were talking about Mario Sunshine and stuff you say.

301
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:24,600
Speaker 1: right and If this doesn't go a mate if this game isn't amazing It'll be the greatest video game flop ever like the next day.

302
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:30,779
Speaker 1: I usually hate it when something happens like a few days ago and people immediately start putting it on like top 10 lists.

303
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:33,640
Speaker 1: like You know, oh, it's the biggest flop ever even though it just happened.

304
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,560
Speaker 0: Well, like Bioshock is already being lauded as one of the top 10 best games ever made.

305
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

306
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,754
Speaker 1: It would put a top 50 maybe but it if TF2 isn't perfect.

307
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,340
Speaker 1: That's the biggest flop ever.

308
00:21:44,862 --> 00:21:47,974
Speaker 0: I mean, it might even displace Daikatana as most infamous game ever.

309
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:52,280
Speaker 1: Oh, you know Daikatana I think just came out on just came out.

310
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,115
Speaker 1: No, no, was it on game tap or one of those services you can?

311
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:55,799
Speaker 1: you can get it now.

312
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:56,642
Speaker 0: But is it?

313
00:21:56,842 --> 00:21:58,106
Speaker 0: it wasn't worth playing then?

314
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,369
Speaker 0: it's not worth playing now.

315
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,653
Speaker 0: It was terrible.

316
00:22:00,673 --> 00:22:01,896
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

317
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:03,160
Speaker 0: Why did you do that to me?

318
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:05,391
Speaker 1: Alright, so I do my thing of the day.

319
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:06,600
Speaker 0: I guess alright.

320
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,987
Speaker 1: so you know how people like to take the high-speed photographs.

321
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:26,491
Speaker 1: they get a camera the camera takes a lot of pictures really fast and Then you know you like shoot a bullet through a pane of glass or you shoot an arrow through an apple or you Drop something in a bucket of water and you can see like all the water the glass moving around Like in super slow motion.

322
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:27,859
Speaker 1: It's way cool, right?

323
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,688
Speaker 1: Well, this guy did something a little better than that.

324
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:34,200
Speaker 1: Not only did he have a ludicrously high-speed camera, right?

325
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:43,720
Speaker 1: But he had a dark room and he had a flash, you know Like an incredible flash that would just be like super bright for like a second like, you know an incredibly short amount of time.

326
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:45,200
Speaker 0: You know, it is comic night.

327
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,473
Speaker 0: I I almost made a joke about the flash just standing there in the room causing trouble.

328
00:22:49,634 --> 00:23:03,230
Speaker 1: and then he had he had a trigger Set so that when there is noise right any audio will set off the camera to take a picture and set off the flash with the perfect timing to get Exactly one high-speed photograph, right.

329
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:07,809
Speaker 1: and then he did a bunch of things in front of it but the ones that are really cool is.

330
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,899
Speaker 1: he took these ceramic figurines of.

331
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:35,360
Speaker 1: You know people, you know in Stances or scenes doing various Asian martial arts like this one Like a guy's getting ready to do a kick and there's one where a guy is kicking another guy and the guy is blocking it And there's another one with like this girl doing some Tai Chi and there's another one with a girl doing Tai Chi and whatever And he took these ceramic figurines and he put him in in front of the camera and he dropped him.

332
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:46,098
Speaker 1: So you get this picture like just as they hit the ground and they're shattered But they're not like totally shattered yet and it's like at the exact moment in time that it's.

333
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:48,085
Speaker 1: it's awesome Just looking at these pictures man.

334
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:48,907
Speaker 1: They're pretty cool.

335
00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:49,830
Speaker 0: You know for some reason.

336
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:54,337
Speaker 0: I don't know why I'm kind of reminded of that video We linked to was the thing of the day a while ago.

337
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are some other things that he took pictures of.

338
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,200
Speaker 1: you know.

339
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:00,045
Speaker 1: I think it's called.

340
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:04,204
Speaker 1: I think they call this like at the moment of impact or something But these are definitely.

341
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:17,480
Speaker 1: he gets the best effect with these because you see like this guy kicking and his leg is in like three Pieces, but they're all still in the air kicking but like all the stuff near the bottom of the sculpture is like completely shattered.

342
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:24,783
Speaker 1: So it looks like a really awesome scene from like a kung-fu movie or something It's like and it's high-resolution, too Right.

343
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:29,637
Speaker 0: So it is anime manga and while we don't do it often comics night.

344
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:36,040
Speaker 1: Oh my god It's time to like get your sweater when you're getting ready to go to hell cuz rim read a comic.

345
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:39,679
Speaker 0: Oh my god that clock never rings ding.

346
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:44,380
Speaker 0: Now tonight we're gonna talk about super spy by Matt kint.

347
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,150
Speaker 1: Yes It is published by top shelf is published this year.

348
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:52,580
Speaker 0: top shelf is known for doing all those indie style Kind of awesome comics.

349
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,300
Speaker 0: They're the people who were always at like every comic convention with the awesome indie kind of booth and the indie kind of stuff.

350
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, they generally like a lot of what they put out.

351
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, this book is $20, but it wasn't $20 for me, but it'd be $20 for you.

352
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:09,171
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I have an opinion as to how much money it's actually worth.

353
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:18,053
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a one self-contained Comic that's broken up into like a whole bunch of smaller stories But they all sort of go into one another.

354
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:33,423
Speaker 1: when we were at mocha Matt kint was actually there and I had heard of this book before going But I decided not to buy it there because it would have cost $20 and I bought it Later, you know with my pre-orders for much less money like $12 or $14 I don't remember.

355
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:38,500
Speaker 1: and they also had a limited-edition hardcover at the mocha arts festival, but I don't think we need that.

356
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,586
Speaker 1: I don't think we need the hardcover.

357
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:41,740
Speaker 1: I think the soft cover is just fine and in fact better.

358
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:53,438
Speaker 1: So this book super spy it is about spying during the Second World War And there are many characters who are all spies of some sort.

359
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,675
Speaker 0: sadly I just read it and I can't name a single one.

360
00:25:56,695 --> 00:26:01,569
Speaker 1: Yeah Shay something those one guy named super spy.

361
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:05,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't remember the names of any of the other ones.

362
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:14,252
Speaker 0: well, here's the real issue that the comic is set in World War two and It's very much has the feel of a World War two or actually more.

363
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:19,407
Speaker 0: it almost feels more like a Cold War era East Germany spy thing just the way the spy.

364
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:22,115
Speaker 0: the spying is like stereotypically of that ilk.

365
00:26:22,697 --> 00:26:23,600
Speaker 1: it definitely it's a lot.

366
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,753
Speaker 1: It's like the spying you see in old spy movies.

367
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:36,723
Speaker 1: Yeah or in old Like noir movies that kind of spying is yeah, we're talking like the poison trap with the code book and the cyanide tooth You know.

368
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:42,499
Speaker 1: or like the two spies, but they don't know the other guys a spy sort of Hitchcock in a way But without the twist ending all the time.

369
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:51,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, and a lot of double-crossing and double agents and triple agents and quadruple agents and stuff going on and stuff going down and Germans and good guys and bad guys and all you did mostly Germans.

370
00:26:52,302 --> 00:27:00,338
Speaker 0: this is it Germans Germans, but The story there actually is a story here and that's interesting that it is that way.

371
00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:03,677
Speaker 0: because well I know Scott gave this to me to read and I'm reading it on the train and I'm enjoying it.

372
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:04,180
Speaker 0: I'm digging it.

373
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,149
Speaker 0: I generally like stories like this.

374
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:15,150
Speaker 1: you get all these little vignettes and each one, you know You read one after the other and in the front of the book It has the table of contents, which is actually really well printed.

375
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,737
Speaker 1: It's it looks like a moleskine, but it's not.

376
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:18,319
Speaker 1: it's pretty cool.

377
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're moleskins.

378
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:25,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it tells you the names of all the different chapters and what page they're on.

379
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:28,415
Speaker 1: But it also gives a DSR number for each chapter.

380
00:27:28,556 --> 00:27:31,125
Speaker 1: and like a dossier yeah, like the dossier number.

381
00:27:31,245 --> 00:27:38,008
Speaker 1: and the thing is the Two chapters are printed in the book in the order that Matt Kent wants you to read them in.

382
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:38,650
Speaker 1: so that's the order.

383
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,475
Speaker 1: I did read them in.

384
00:27:39,937 --> 00:27:48,170
Speaker 1: but if you look at the dossier number you can Figure that you can figure out by by arranging the stories by dossier number the chronological order.

385
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:56,130
Speaker 1: So you don't read the stories in chronological order, you know, and I bet if you did read the stories in chronological order It would be quite a different experience.

386
00:27:56,411 --> 00:28:03,817
Speaker 0: yeah, of course it'd be tough because a lot of stories kind of branch and like one will end like a scene will happen and Astoria will keep going.

387
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:12,171
Speaker 0: but if you read another dossier later That one starts right when that scene ended with one of the other characters in that scene going off and doing something else at the same Time.

388
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:12,512
Speaker 1: Yep.

389
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:23,390
Speaker 1: The other thing is that a lot of the stories sort of aren't directly like Continuations like some of them happen way before everything else and some of them have it way after everything else.

390
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:29,509
Speaker 1: So if you just read read them in chronological order Some of them are just gonna seem so out of place.

391
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:32,542
Speaker 1: So I do think you should read the order in which they are printed.

392
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:34,330
Speaker 1: but it is I guess cool.

393
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:36,995
Speaker 1: I kept looking like the first few chapters I read.

394
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:42,870
Speaker 1: I kept looking back To see what order they actually happened in and tried to keep it straight in my mind.

395
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:45,869
Speaker 1: And then after about ten chapters I gave up on that because it wasn't worth it.

396
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:53,018
Speaker 0: But like I was gonna say before all that it really there's a problem with this book And I guess because I just went into it.

397
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:55,787
Speaker 0: reading didn't read the back or the contents or anything.

398
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:56,670
Speaker 0: I just started reading it.

399
00:28:56,892 --> 00:28:58,729
Speaker 1: I read the front thing in the book, but that was it.

400
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:12,902
Speaker 0: I got about a third of the way through thinking that it was just a bunch of totally unrelated vignettes about spies and Then one of them happened to end and then begin with like the same character from the previous one in another situation.

401
00:29:13,423 --> 00:29:22,776
Speaker 0: and then I started flipping back through and I realized that all The characters from all the stories keep appearing in each other's stories and it's all this contiguous plot But the way the art is.

402
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:33,636
Speaker 0: I didn't notice that for the longest time and even after I knew about it It was really hard to keep track of which character was which and sometimes it was really hard to even Know what was going on.

403
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:40,965
Speaker 0: in a scene like I see a character die and then I see that character alive But clearly after the fact and oh wait, no, it's a different guy cuz the.

404
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:42,250
Speaker 0: oh I have to look at the mustache.

405
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:42,973
Speaker 0: He has a mustache.

406
00:29:42,993 --> 00:29:45,887
Speaker 0: There's a little tiny there and I really couldn't tell who was who.

407
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:55,750
Speaker 1: yes I knew earlier on in the book like a chapter or two in that I was like, hey, wait a minute Like I saw a guy who kind of looked like a guy I saw before.

408
00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:58,569
Speaker 1: So I flipped back and forth and I was like, is it the same guy?

409
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,835
Speaker 1: Is it the same guy?

410
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:02,630
Speaker 1: and I decided that it was and I was right.

411
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:07,270
Speaker 1: But I wasn't like a hundred percent confident and it wasn't easy to recognize.

412
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:23,270
Speaker 1: So a lot of the time like I was enjoying the stories and I actually enjoy the aesthetic style of the art But a lot of the reading of the book was sort of Hindered because I had to spend so much effort trying to say is that that guy?

413
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,920
Speaker 1: You know, is that that guy or is that a different guy?

414
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:27,850
Speaker 1: Did this happen before after that?

415
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:43,349
Speaker 1: I was spent so much time as if I was a spy I guess trying to make sense of all this code that I couldn't actually Enjoy the contents fully and even even if I read it again I would still have a hard time recognizing the characters so much.

416
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:47,509
Speaker 0: The issue I definitely had and that I could see now.

417
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:50,812
Speaker 0: wow This is really complex and cool and there's all these Interactions.

418
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:58,650
Speaker 0: and this scene would probably mean a lot more to me if I remembered exactly which character this was and exactly why she's in this situation now.

419
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:05,130
Speaker 0: But I just made because the characters weren't distinctive enough and they didn't use a lot of proper names or anything in the story.

420
00:31:06,053 --> 00:31:13,241
Speaker 0: You really can't easily keep a thread of all the characters at all times and you'll end up missing out on a lot of the subtler details.

421
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:21,981
Speaker 0: and frankly Don't worry about that because once I stopped caring just gave up and just kind of read it and just if I wasn't sure who Her character was I just didn't care and kept going.

422
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:23,610
Speaker 0: It was much more enjoyable.

423
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:26,638
Speaker 1: Yeah the only time it really mattered is when you get to the end.

424
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:34,668
Speaker 1: there's like these five chapters at the six chapters at the end called The end one the end to the end three the end for the end five and six and those that sort of like.

425
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:45,808
Speaker 1: they wrap up all the different characters that have been continuing along and As long as you recognize like two or three of the most easily recognizable ones, you'll be alright at the end It'll be cool.

426
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:50,552
Speaker 0: Yeah Even if you forget half the things they did in the middle of the story as long as you know who they are by the End it works.

427
00:31:51,255 --> 00:31:51,857
Speaker 0: It's sort of though.

428
00:31:51,897 --> 00:31:55,330
Speaker 0: My favorite character is the spymaster who we only really see at the end.

429
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:10,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of like a catch-22 this book in a way in that it's cool because it's such a complex interwoven story of Spies, you know do getting tied up in each other and tied up in this other business and all this crazy stuff going on.

430
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:13,502
Speaker 1: And that's a way cool story that you want to experience.

431
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:25,630
Speaker 1: but because it's so complex It's so hard to digest that the difficulty of having that story delivered to you and the complexity of it Ruins the awesomeness of the complexity.

432
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:34,914
Speaker 0: But if you recognize that fact and you have to read this the same way, I am playing Final Fantasy Tactics advance because you could.

433
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:47,689
Speaker 0: you could care a lot about the exact details of what's going on and trying to figure it out just like you Could care a lot about finding all the secret characters and doing all the you know level everybody up to get all the classes business and Final Fantasy Tactics.

434
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:55,581
Speaker 0: if You don't care if you miss something and you just kind of go in expecting some fun You'll have a lot of fun and you won't miss.

435
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:59,206
Speaker 0: so as much as you might think you'll miss and you won't care about the Things that you did miss.

436
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:04,250
Speaker 1: Alright, so did you have any particularly favorite memorable stories in here?

437
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:04,611
Speaker 0: See it's.

438
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:11,010
Speaker 0: I really like just the aesthetic of how each story was in such a different style and was all these different takes on spying.

439
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:22,040
Speaker 0: I think my favorite one was early on where It's one that shows one spy and this other spy and it keeps cutting back between two of them kind of their inner monologues Going through the same motions, but thinking different things.

440
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:28,710
Speaker 0: the one the one guy who's like the one guy like it starts out And he's like spying is an exacting science.

441
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:35,830
Speaker 0: It is a precise planning blah blah blah blah, and then it cuts to the other guy and he's like spying is an art.

442
00:33:36,152 --> 00:33:45,216
Speaker 1: You have to just kind of wing it by the seat of your pants And one guy is sort of like the fast and loose sort of more like, you know liberal-ish kind of guy You know, he's.

443
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:53,610
Speaker 1: he's dressing like a bum He's riding his bike all around town and the other guy is like a clean-cut businessman kind of spy doing the same routine every day.

444
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,439
Speaker 1: You know the other guys like hiding in plain sight.

445
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:58,546
Speaker 1: the other guy is hiding, you know, for real.

446
00:33:59,028 --> 00:33:59,630
Speaker 1: I like that story.

447
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,213
Speaker 1: That was a good one.

448
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:03,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean each individual story is really really good.

449
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:09,135
Speaker 0: Another one I really liked is the one with the guy who's about to be executed for being a spy and he asks for one Last cigarette.

450
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:11,590
Speaker 0: Ah, I mean it was a twist ending.

451
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,788
Speaker 1: I saw coming but I didn't see that one coming actually got me see.

452
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:29,149
Speaker 0: I saw it coming But the thing is it's one of those rare ones where you see it coming and you know But you don't care that you know because you just want to see it actually happen Like you're just waiting for the bomb to drop even though you know, it's been dropping the whole time.

453
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:34,533
Speaker 1: My favorite one is the one it's actually in a slightly different artistic style than the others Like it has.

454
00:34:34,654 --> 00:34:46,420
Speaker 1: like there are a few that just have different styles to them like different way He colors them and so like a black outline around the page this guy like gets in a car accident and somehow He gets stuck as like a spy.

455
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:50,659
Speaker 1: and like they thought like the resistance picks him up and Forces him to do a job for them.

456
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:52,150
Speaker 0: That one was super Hitchcock.

457
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:52,812
Speaker 1: It was.

458
00:34:53,152 --> 00:35:14,519
Speaker 1: and like they end up like drawing like the secret map on his for on his head and then his spoilers Yeah and then they he grows his hair back so no one can see and Like he gets super injured like he loses an eye and it's sort of like wow Wow One of those tragedies, you know where someone's forced into a tough situation They just deal with it and they get they come out.

459
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:20,985
Speaker 1: the other end, you know, and it's just like, ah Honestly, I mean I'd say it's not terribly realistic.

460
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:21,808
Speaker 0: You can't say that.

461
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:22,150
Speaker 0: It's real.

462
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:23,117
Speaker 1: No, this is not.

463
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:25,010
Speaker 1: I mean some of it I guess could be realistic.

464
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:29,790
Speaker 1: But at the same time there are some hints of you know things that really happened in history.

465
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:36,555
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah There's a. there's one part where like there's a guy who's a code breaker as a bunch of shelves and it says like enigma on The shelves.

466
00:35:36,898 --> 00:35:47,990
Speaker 0: Well, I was thinking more of the one The guy who served in a uni I don't want to ruin that one story in case someone doesn't see it coming The guy who was a spy in World War one and he then he served in World War two in his own unique way.

467
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:58,470
Speaker 0: Yeah that because that was based on a real event obviously, but uh, but while it's not realistic It's at least kind of self consistent in terms of what is possible at how spying works.

468
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,590
Speaker 0: It's kind of like that Cold War game we have where it follows the rules of movie spying.

469
00:36:03,132 --> 00:36:08,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, however, there's one character that really kind of annoyed me Shayla Whatever her name was the shark.

470
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:12,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was sort of I couldn't understand like what her motivation was.

471
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,244
Speaker 1: She seemed sort of inconsistent to me like in one scene.

472
00:36:15,285 --> 00:36:19,786
Speaker 1: She's doing this another scene She's doing that and I'm like, what are you really doing here?

473
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:20,550
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

474
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,310
Speaker 0: I think the worst thing was that she was too badass for this story and for this world.

475
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:32,750
Speaker 0: It was kind of a let's make this super strong amazingly badass female spy and he just totally didn't fit with everything else.

476
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:33,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, really didn't.

477
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:42,321
Speaker 1: everyone else was a very down-to-earth sort of James Bond like the books kind of spy where you know You can get beat up and killed and they died really easily.

478
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:44,830
Speaker 1: a lot of these people die just up you're dead.

479
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:46,048
Speaker 1: Yep, you got shot you died.

480
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:52,549
Speaker 1: But except for her she was like, you know, like some super danger actually a super spy.

481
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:59,230
Speaker 0: funny How the most badass character is the least interesting least engaging and the one I just I skipped a lot of her stuff.

482
00:37:00,513 --> 00:37:04,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, meanwhile, there's a guy actually named super spy and early on in the book.

483
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:08,348
Speaker 1: He's a super spy and you don't see him until you always.

484
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:08,710
Speaker 1: you know.

485
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:16,204
Speaker 1: I knew he was gonna show up again and I learned how to recognize him because you know He was the guy they called super spy and that's the name of the book.

486
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:17,409
Speaker 0: I love what happens to him.

487
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:18,776
Speaker 1: What happens to him?

488
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:21,046
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna spoil it is so terrific.

489
00:37:21,187 --> 00:37:30,888
Speaker 1: Oh my god I mean cuz one thing happens and then in the end another thing happens and it's just yeah the guy there's only like two or three chapters that have him in it and it's just I like.

490
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:36,063
Speaker 1: as Small as his part was, you know, the book was named after him.

491
00:37:36,143 --> 00:37:38,070
Speaker 1: I go he was named as the same name as the book.

492
00:37:39,275 --> 00:37:42,258
Speaker 1: He was definitely Pretty good right there.

493
00:37:42,963 --> 00:37:48,026
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I don't know I the art is the styles good But it I think it really kind of hinders.

494
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:53,230
Speaker 0: It's it forces you to read the book just really fast and loose if you try to get any more detail than that.

495
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:58,690
Speaker 1: Well, the alternative is you can read the book slowly and carefully and it will be difficult.

496
00:37:58,933 --> 00:37:59,541
Speaker 1: I think I mean it.

497
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:00,249
Speaker 1: we're pretty smart.

498
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:06,737
Speaker 1: We yeah at a heart at least without like taking notes or something or at least just like really caring It's just or really paying attention.

499
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:09,950
Speaker 0: putting that very slowly putting that effort in will make the book less enjoyable.

500
00:38:10,472 --> 00:38:12,217
Speaker 1: yeah, it's like you could get.

501
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:19,242
Speaker 1: in order to get everything this book has out you have to put a lot more in and Putting it in was not fun.

502
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:20,570
Speaker 1: Only the getting out is fun.

503
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:28,530
Speaker 0: However, and I do think that despite how stylized and everything it was I Think you can adapt this into a pretty damn good movie.

504
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,061
Speaker 1: Oh, you can make a pretty awesome it with the movies.

505
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:36,469
Speaker 1: if it was a live-action movie or something You could you'd see the same people and you would totally recognize them.

506
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:37,555
Speaker 1: Yeah be awesome.

507
00:38:37,697 --> 00:38:42,342
Speaker 0: and it's kind of set up like Storyboards almost and you could totally make a movie about this.

508
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:44,490
Speaker 0: that would kind of in the style of Sin City.

509
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:48,590
Speaker 0: I think I just think something like that would be amazing and I see someone do it.

510
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:57,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is sort of like reading like like a movie script in a way Like it would be more like a Pulp Fiction in that you have all these small bits that are like Sin City.

511
00:38:58,111 --> 00:38:58,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, kinda.

512
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:07,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, like either one of those where you have a movie made of smaller movies But the same characters show up again and you know, and they tie together into the bigger story.

513
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:10,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean all I do is those kind of movies.

514
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,445
Speaker 0: I'd take out the shark cuz.

515
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:13,971
Speaker 0: I like snatches just Snatch.

516
00:39:14,473 --> 00:39:15,697
Speaker 0: we ever talked about snatch.

517
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:16,821
Speaker 1: I don't know.

518
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:17,443
Speaker 0: on the show.

519
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:21,900
Speaker 0: We've had to have mentioned it I know but I don't think we've ever actually done a show on it.

520
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:23,465
Speaker 1: That is the stone.

521
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:33,468
Speaker 0: There's the stone Right, so Let's not get into that.

522
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,437
Speaker 0: But yeah, this book is good.

523
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:41,549
Speaker 0: I enjoyed it, but I'm gonna be blunt I don't think it was worth $20 because I read it in like a half hour.

524
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:44,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think it's worth $20.

525
00:39:44,494 --> 00:39:48,710
Speaker 1: but if you can get this book with some sort of say just let's go look at the Amazon price.

526
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:55,056
Speaker 0: If one of your friends buys it and then you borrow it or if a bunch of you pay for it and then just kind Of pass it around or something.

527
00:39:55,738 --> 00:40:00,949
Speaker 1: It's definitely worth borrowing because especially if you like spy stuff Oh, if you like spy stuff, you should probably just buy it.

528
00:40:02,073 --> 00:40:11,761
Speaker 0: If you're a spy fan like a fanboy of spies if you like the that noir style femme fatale Cyanide pill in the coffee kind of spying with knockout gas.

529
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:13,707
Speaker 0: This is so up your alley.

530
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:15,032
Speaker 1: All right on Amazon It's only $14.

531
00:40:15,032 --> 00:40:16,037
Speaker 1: All right, it's worth $14.

532
00:40:16,037 --> 00:40:23,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's $14 ain't so bad especially cuz you know you can just sell it on Amazon after you buy it for like $12 used.

533
00:40:24,078 --> 00:40:24,842
Speaker 1: so there you go.

534
00:40:25,043 --> 00:40:25,404
Speaker 1: Sadly.

535
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:26,690
Speaker 0: I don't have much more to say.

536
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:31,190
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't want to bring up any of the stories of the characters because it's kind of pointless.

537
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:45,258
Speaker 1: Yep There were some chapters in the book actually that had like a lot of text and they weren't really so Comicky and they sort of dragged a little bit cuz like they took longer to get through than some of the other chapters that had Little to no text in them.

538
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:49,098
Speaker 0: Yeah, I skipped a lot over Polly the paragon.

539
00:40:49,118 --> 00:40:50,890
Speaker 1: Oh, no by the very green is awesome.

540
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:51,633
Speaker 0: I liked it.

541
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:53,902
Speaker 0: I like the art and I like the style and everything.

542
00:40:54,223 --> 00:40:55,167
Speaker 0: It's just the story itself.

543
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:55,810
Speaker 0: I mean I read it.

544
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:57,375
Speaker 0: I just didn't really.

545
00:40:57,396 --> 00:40:59,644
Speaker 1: I thought the paragon was one of the good parts.

546
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:00,728
Speaker 0: I didn't linger over it.

547
00:41:00,788 --> 00:41:03,013
Speaker 0: I'm sorry You suck.

548
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,819
Speaker 0: It wasn't as good as some of the other parts.

549
00:41:05,341 --> 00:41:06,224
Speaker 1: It was okay.

550
00:41:06,445 --> 00:41:07,990
Speaker 0: thing is I would probably read Polly.

551
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:17,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there was a book just Polly the paragon, I would totally read this kind of like Ollie kind of like Ollie But for kitties, oh, oh, he's also for kitties before and for our spy kitties.

552
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:29,602
Speaker 1: So, yeah super spy by Matt kint is not bad Not great not stellar not excellent, but it's no watchman.

553
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:31,710
Speaker 1: But then again, it's no underwear pervert.

554
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:34,470
Speaker 0: It's definitely if you're a comic fan worth reading.

555
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,640
Speaker 0: It's really all I can say about it.

556
00:41:36,902 --> 00:41:38,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's hard.

557
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:44,370
Speaker 0: I mean if we review something that we don't love or hate or disagree on it's kind of hard to say more than that.

558
00:41:44,651 --> 00:41:45,634
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's the thing is.

559
00:41:45,674 --> 00:41:52,309
Speaker 1: I wanted to really felt like we weren't doing enough reviews of things that weren't Disagree on love or hate, you know.

560
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:58,070
Speaker 1: And it doesn't seem like any other podcasters really seem to do them either because it's very hard to review something that's met.

561
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:58,797
Speaker 1: I mean, what do you say?

562
00:41:59,161 --> 00:42:00,070
Speaker 1: this book is average?

563
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:06,590
Speaker 1: It's you get some enjoyment out of it, but it's not gonna like make you like fall over, you know in ecstasy.

564
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:08,320
Speaker 1: It's also not gonna bore you to death.

565
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,285
Speaker 1: It's it's just a book.

566
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:14,669
Speaker 1: It's good it's possibly worth your time depending on how much time and how much money it costs.

567
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:28,427
Speaker 1: and now I think the problem here is that Reviewing something that's man doesn't make your podcast So entertaining or interesting unless you start going off on a tangent talking about things that are met and reviewing them Like I am right now.

568
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:33,870
Speaker 1: But at the same time I kind of want to give exposure to this because I think this does deserve some exposure.

569
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:40,149
Speaker 1: Yeah There are people out there who are gonna love this book and they probably never even heard of it until now and I want to do a podcast on it.

570
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,930
Speaker 1: But the podcast can't be that entertaining because I don't love hate or disagree with this book.

571
00:42:45,431 --> 00:42:51,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I can say is that I wanted to get more exposure because I really want someone to option it and make a movie.

572
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,339
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, like.

573
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:59,679
Speaker 1: please if you are a movie maker You should go to Matt Kent and say we would like to option your super spy because He will probably go.

574
00:42:59,921 --> 00:43:00,484
Speaker 1: Yes, please.

575
00:43:00,504 --> 00:43:01,590
Speaker 1: I would love to make money.

576
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:08,229
Speaker 0: This is the kind of thing where if I had the kind of money to invest I and there were a project about this I'd invest in it because I think it would succeed.

577
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:10,701
Speaker 1: Oh man a movie like like I would.

578
00:43:10,982 --> 00:43:16,828
Speaker 1: it doesn't get me to go to the theater often But if someone made a movie of this I'd be in the theater and that's that's saying a lot.

579
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:18,555
Speaker 0: Yes It is Scott doesn't like going to.

580
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:22,950
Speaker 0: what was the last non anime movie you saw in the theater and the theater?

581
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:23,975
Speaker 0: Cuz the last anime.

582
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:27,030
Speaker 1: but well the last movie we go to see the Lewis black Robin Williams movie.

583
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:29,178
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we went to see man of the year.

584
00:43:29,198 --> 00:43:32,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could have seen that on DVD and been just fine.

585
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:33,249
Speaker 0: You know what?

586
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:37,249
Speaker 0: It was worth it just for the fact that no one in the theater knew what a sucky bus was except us.

587
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:42,447
Speaker 1: I think it was worth it only because there was nothing doing that night and we had nothing better to do.

588
00:43:42,507 --> 00:43:44,549
Speaker 1: and like the timing Was just so perfect that yeah

589
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:45,172
Speaker 0: I happen

590
00:43:45,192 --> 00:43:52,197
Speaker 1: to be eating at the restaurant right next to the movie theater and we happened to get out of dinner and the movie Happened to be starting walking

591
00:43:52,258 --> 00:43:54,066
Speaker 0: over and we're like, you know, I kind of want to see that movie.

592
00:43:54,447 --> 00:43:56,556
Speaker 0: if it's starting It was next two minutes.

593
00:43:56,656 --> 00:43:58,724
Speaker 1: Let's go see and it was starting in like five minutes.

594
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:00,050
Speaker 0: So we're like, huh?

595
00:44:00,652 --> 00:44:01,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, any less convenient?

596
00:44:02,021 --> 00:44:02,363
Speaker 1: I wouldn't.

597
00:44:02,484 --> 00:44:05,029
Speaker 0: even then we were like You wanna?

598
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:07,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, screw it.

599
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:07,939
Speaker 0: Let's do it.

600
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,999
Speaker 1: I think before that Did we see episode three?

601
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:12,601
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.

602
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:13,424
Speaker 0: I'm glad I did.

603
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:17,914
Speaker 0: I wish I hadn't seen episode one in the theater That's for sure.

604
00:44:18,215 --> 00:44:20,425
Speaker 1: and I think about this episode three in the theater.

605
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:21,449
Speaker 1: I walked right in.

606
00:44:21,851 --> 00:44:25,850
Speaker 1: It wasn't as good as episode four five six was worth it, you know, yeah, it was episode one.

607
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,099
Speaker 0: I waited in fucking line got episode one.

608
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,987
Speaker 0: I we were there the day before.

609
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:32,116
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, great.

610
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:37,734
Speaker 0: But meanwhile Lord of the Rings we were there for the opening showing and a crazy That was worth it.

611
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:38,878
Speaker 1: No, that wasn't worth it.

612
00:44:38,938 --> 00:44:40,765
Speaker 0: That was exceeded expectations.

613
00:44:40,885 --> 00:44:41,307
Speaker 0: Yeah.

614
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:45,644
Speaker 1: All right Topic too much I met can't.

615
00:44:45,705 --> 00:44:46,190
Speaker 1: top shelf?

616
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,855
Speaker 1: You should also anything.

617
00:44:47,895 --> 00:45:01,510
Speaker 1: you should look through the top shelf catalog because top shelf publishes a lot of awesome books some of them by Alan Moore the guy who we're at Watchmen and some of them not by Alan Moore and Many of those books are good not all but many and worth reading.

618
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:15,746
Speaker 0: I guess the thing you should do is look at what they put out, you know Look at the cover art maybe read a little bit about it And if it's about a topic that's up your alley or if the art is a style that you like It's worth risking it and just buying it because on average top shelf stuff is pretty top shelf

619
00:45:15,867 --> 00:45:23,470
Speaker 1: and they generally Print published comics that are not underwear perverts and are usually a higher brow in some way or another.

620
00:45:23,991 --> 00:45:25,958
Speaker 0: Low brow, but I'm quite low brow.

621
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,230
Speaker 1: I'm high brow, but sometimes low brow.
