1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,188
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday September 20th 2011.

2
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:12,629
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,135
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,636 --> 00:00:20,511
Speaker 1: the hive a game buzzing with Possibilities.

5
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:21,799
Speaker 1: that's what it says on the box.

6
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:23,952
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:30,172
Speaker 1: That is what it says on the box hive a game buzzing with possibilities.

8
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:32,880
Speaker 1: and the website is hive mania.com.

9
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,565
Speaker 0: Okay, so So rim?

10
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:42,795
Speaker 0: yeah, you know there's a lot of old games that we'd like to play But we cannot play at least not easily or reasonably like tie fighter.

11
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:45,726
Speaker 0: Oh my god You actually came up with the game.

12
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:51,754
Speaker 0: I was going to discuss because without any sort of Pre-telling wait that's ready to get.

13
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:58,980
Speaker 0: that's really what you're gonna Talk about because usually I was expecting you to like be like tribes to and name all the other games except for the one that I was trying to discuss.

14
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:10,214
Speaker 1: No, but you see if I go back of all the if you talk about like my desire to play a game That does exist or did exist in some form where I don't even need it to be.

15
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:12,544
Speaker 0: I know that that was the right answer But I was just.

16
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:22,119
Speaker 0: I was assuming that as soon as I needed you to say it you wouldn't say it But the fact that you said it is like oh my god That was kind of amazing because usually tribes too is the answer and I swear there was no pre talking whatsoever.

17
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:23,950
Speaker 0: Rim had no idea what I was going for.

18
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:24,714
Speaker 1: so all right.

19
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:25,740
Speaker 1: so tie fighter.

20
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:31,837
Speaker 0: I. literally there's a major flaw in tie fighter of an extreme flaw.

21
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:32,157
Speaker 1: Well.

22
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:33,060
Speaker 1: Here's one flaw.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,304
Speaker 0: It's so old.

24
00:01:35,524 --> 00:01:37,370
Speaker 0: That's not the flaw and so slow.

25
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:45,860
Speaker 1: You're totally way off, and I'm so good at not even close that I Can basically single-handedly with a tie interceptor take out like a star destroyer.

26
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,238
Speaker 0: So here's the flaw of tie fight single player that I realize is a major problem.

27
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,625
Speaker 0: alright That makes it basically.

28
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:52,710
Speaker 0: I can't I can't play that game.

29
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,513
Speaker 0: You don't have a joystick.

30
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:54,880
Speaker 0: No not even close.

31
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,406
Speaker 1: You don't have the instruction manual anymore.

32
00:01:57,627 --> 00:01:59,673
Speaker 0: No when you're playing tie fighter.

33
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:01,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you see I?

34
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,678
Speaker 1: See a tornado withering?

35
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,227
Speaker 0: no What do you actually see on the screen?

36
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:11,638
Speaker 1: I see out the front of my ship.

37
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:15,440
Speaker 0: yeah Have you ever seen a tie fighter pilot?

38
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, the kind of funny look.

39
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,174
Speaker 0: do you remember what they look like?

40
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:19,898
Speaker 0: they look something like this?

41
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,851
Speaker 0: What do you think he fucking sees out of that fucking helmet?

42
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,440
Speaker 0: he probably he sees like two black slits.

43
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:30,669
Speaker 1: He probably has displays inside of that helmet.

44
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:36,912
Speaker 0: then how come he you when when you're playing tie fighter you actually see the physical Inside of the ship as opposed to just heads-up display.

45
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:37,776
Speaker 1: You're so badass.

46
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:38,539
Speaker 1: You took the helmet off.

47
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:39,644
Speaker 0: I know you didn't.

48
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:42,193
Speaker 0: you die in the cold horrible of space plus.

49
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:42,654
Speaker 1: How do you know?

50
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:44,180
Speaker 1: maybe there's cameras?

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,167
Speaker 1: No eyes, maybe there's lenses.

52
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:48,336
Speaker 0: No, it's it's total bullshit.

53
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:49,280
Speaker 1: I don't think it's that bad.

54
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,266
Speaker 1: You don't know what it looks like.

55
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:51,031
Speaker 0: a helmet off.

56
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:53,426
Speaker 0: That's what this hose is coming out of it So he can fucking breathe.

57
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:54,453
Speaker 1: I want to point out.

58
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,500
Speaker 1: There's a much bigger flaw.

59
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:57,967
Speaker 1: What did what was Darth Vader doing?

60
00:02:57,987 --> 00:03:03,084
Speaker 1: I take it Scott that you when he kept turning way way way little knobs I was gonna say what.

61
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:06,072
Speaker 1: what like interface does Darth Vader have to his ship?

62
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:11,015
Speaker 1: and apparently it is an Atari 2600 paddle controller and nothing else.

63
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:14,730
Speaker 0: I Basically I can tell you exactly what he was doing.

64
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,534
Speaker 0: and no this isn't.

65
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:19,820
Speaker 0: this is based on my Scott Reuben, it's not based on any Star Wars things.

66
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:22,640
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are plenty of Star Wars nerds who came up with an answer for this.

67
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,100
Speaker 0: All right, but according to me what he was doing is basically he controls the ship with the force.

68
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:28,742
Speaker 1: All right.

69
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:29,665
Speaker 1: So what was that knobbly?

70
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:32,977
Speaker 0: The only thing he can't control with the force is the fuel injection.

71
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:35,082
Speaker 0: So Fuel.

72
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:38,496
Speaker 1: what fuel does the tie fighter use base fuel do?

73
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,846
Speaker 1: I'm gonna google right now What is Darth Vader doing with?

74
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:47,220
Speaker 0: they definitely have fuel because they had the the Millennium Falcon Refueles on the cloud city and also tattooing.

75
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,180
Speaker 1: All right, I searched for what was Darth Vader doing with that knob and I didn't find anything really.

76
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:53,807
Speaker 0: I'm sure this.

77
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:55,520
Speaker 0: the nerds are gonna come out and tell us.

78
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:59,400
Speaker 1: I'm sure I could google more specifically for like tie fighter knob interface.

79
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,851
Speaker 0: But basically my excuse is that every part of the the rest of the time Look at what was controlled with the force except for the knob.

80
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,700
Speaker 1: So look at what Porkins and everybody was doing.

81
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,344
Speaker 0: No, you know what?

82
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:10,551
Speaker 0: I got here's the real answer.

83
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:11,940
Speaker 0: That was wizard.

84
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:16,456
Speaker 0: No that no, he was actually controlling the entire ship with the force and that was his flask.

85
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:17,620
Speaker 0: He was unscrewing the cat.

86
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,369
Speaker 0: That's why he spun off into space cuz he was wasted.

87
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:21,690
Speaker 0: he could.

88
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,500
Speaker 1: I think they can see just fine out of those stupid helmets.

89
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,209
Speaker 0: They can't see fine out of the stupid helmet.

90
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,542
Speaker 1: That helmet actually doesn't look that bad Uh-huh.

91
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:30,265
Speaker 1: Sure.

92
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:31,048
Speaker 1: Also Scott.

93
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,553
Speaker 0: We call it the 501st.

94
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:33,276
Speaker 0: You'll put one on.

95
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,240
Speaker 0: we'll see what you can see.

96
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:40,139
Speaker 1: I'm sure I will be able to see many things including a dread specter of stillborn children on the horizon.

97
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:43,088
Speaker 1: Sure I love how the prince of nothing has corrupted me.

98
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:51,918
Speaker 1: to where if any if someone so much as says the words see See and anything in any way related to a question do see you see?

99
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:53,102
Speaker 1: yep Any of those?

100
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,566
Speaker 1: any combination or what?

101
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:55,890
Speaker 0: do you something else beside?

102
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,652
Speaker 0: What do you hear?

103
00:04:57,013 --> 00:05:02,795
Speaker 1: It's a very simple regular expression That generates this meme coming out of me, right?

104
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:03,699
Speaker 0: So let's let's move on

105
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:12,775
Speaker 1: Alright, so I got a little bit of a geek bite because as you may know Natural selection is one of our favorite games ever made favorite one of our favorite FPS

106
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,400
Speaker 0: and we're not talking about the Darwin book even

107
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:17,995
Speaker 1: One of our favorite games of any genre.

108
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:19,160
Speaker 1: It's a fantastic game.

109
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,800
Speaker 1: In fact, we talked about it glowingly in many different panels over many years at many conventions and many episodes of you.

110
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:26,910
Speaker 1: So I don't need to talk about how great it is.

111
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,739
Speaker 0: Except you just did so a while ago.

112
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:33,778
Speaker 0: Uh, we bought natural selection to a long time ago pre-ordered that shit 50 bucks.

113
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,313
Speaker 1: Yep We paid for the super ultimate platinum gold black edition.

114
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:44,149
Speaker 0: We gave them a pile of money and Before seeing any product that could have been a bbocs situation.

115
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,734
Speaker 1: I point out many times in my life.

116
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:47,640
Speaker 1: I have been burned.

117
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:50,819
Speaker 1: Burned is such an understatement roasted.

118
00:05:51,582 --> 00:06:05,145
Speaker 1: I remember there was a website where you typed in a person's name and it would go through the decade that that person waited between team fortress and team fortress 2 Mmm and yeah team fortress 2 Was.

119
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:07,356
Speaker 1: it was kind of a disappointment.

120
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:13,519
Speaker 1: Yeah To me personally, so go on and tribes, you know, it's just never gonna come back.

121
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,454
Speaker 1: But tell natural selection 2 is playable in an alpha beta state.

122
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,660
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's technically an alpha or a beta anymore.

123
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:23,837
Speaker 1: I don't remember if it was a telecaster or a stratocaster.

124
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,645
Speaker 1: So That's another thing that comes out.

125
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:34,471
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I tried to play a natural selection - again Over the weekend as I attempt to do about once a month.

126
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:36,800
Speaker 0: and you know what on your very fast computer on your files.

127
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:37,944
Speaker 1: Yes, I have files.

128
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:40,836
Speaker 1: I have a computer that while I built it quite some time ago.

129
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:42,904
Speaker 1: I seven with 7 money could buy one enough to play.

130
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:43,507
Speaker 1: ns2 is the point?

131
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:47,263
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

132
00:06:47,704 --> 00:06:48,106
Speaker 1: You know what?

133
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:50,454
Speaker 1: ns2 is unplayable any server I join.

134
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:56,939
Speaker 1: There's one skulk Running around biting a bunch of t-pose Marines stuck in their base.

135
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:04,092
Speaker 0: Meanwhile if you would read the ns2 Twitter feed It's like they're talking about adjusting the game balance and upgrading weapon models.

136
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,540
Speaker 0: It's like are you even playing the same fucking game?

137
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,179
Speaker 1: So your team doesn't work.

138
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,149
Speaker 0: About balance and models and graphics.

139
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:12,374
Speaker 0: your game does not work.

140
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:23,375
Speaker 1: I have two questions because one Reading forums and what other people are saying about the game It appears that there is a small percentage of people who actually claim to be playing.

141
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:28,700
Speaker 0: either they're lying Or maybe they're only playing land mode or something.

142
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,540
Speaker 1: Maybe I gave my money to a different group of people and got scammed by accident and they're all playing the real game.

143
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,399
Speaker 0: I don't fucking know.

144
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:52,400
Speaker 0: Maybe I think my guess is that is land mode right because in the office they're testing against each other on a land They're not doing because I realized that most of the anecdotes I've heard about ns2 play come from the development team themselves and not any other person.

145
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:56,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, they need to all work from home with fucking cable modems until that shit fucking works.

146
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,493
Speaker 1: However, it's not the net code in and of itself.

147
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:00,920
Speaker 1: There are more fundamental problems.

148
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,672
Speaker 1: I've mostly lost faith in the project, but I lost faith a long time ago.

149
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:07,575
Speaker 1: I already gave him my money.

150
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:15,137
Speaker 1: However, unlike Team fortress or weapons factory or tie fighter or tribes 2 or tribes?

151
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:25,665
Speaker 1: I can still play ns and you know what and as one ns natural selection is still to this day one of the best games ever and you know what.

152
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:30,308
Speaker 1: I was playing over the weekend and It was exactly the same as it's always been though.

153
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:34,528
Speaker 1: The community is a tiny bit smaller Tiny bit.

154
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:35,900
Speaker 0: I haven't noticed that only a tiny bit.

155
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,774
Speaker 1: There's like four or five active full-on real games without any bullshit mods.

156
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:42,217
Speaker 0: I only ever go to bad clan.

157
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:43,020
Speaker 0: That's bad clan.

158
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,131
Speaker 1: There's one other server.

159
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:44,575
Speaker 1: I go to.

160
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:48,730
Speaker 1: okay But the community is a little more pissy.

161
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:55,627
Speaker 1: I haven't noticed it except for marine commander who yeah sounds Older and a little more subdued.

162
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's going around.

163
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,533
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah.

164
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:58,657
Speaker 1: Yeah get him gorge.

165
00:08:58,677 --> 00:08:59,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, fuck we lost.

166
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Speaker 1: Let's just like he gives up way more easily.

167
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:03,860
Speaker 0: They never have drugs this weekend.

168
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:10,380
Speaker 1: But yeah, I joined the server and I hadn't played this game in like a year and I start to play on the random server.

169
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,508
Speaker 1: I just join and immediately I'm on the aliens and some guys like You've got to get a gorge.

170
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:17,231
Speaker 0: Yeah.

171
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was like, oh man, it's him.

172
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:21,676
Speaker 1: That guy must do nothing but play this game.

173
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:22,360
Speaker 0: Awesome.

174
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:24,707
Speaker 0: So check this out.

175
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:26,697
Speaker 0: I should probably talk about this on Monday, but I don't care.

176
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:29,488
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, so the Maker Faire was this weekend.

177
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:30,130
Speaker 1: Yep.

178
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,873
Speaker 0: I did not go.

179
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:31,977
Speaker 1: I biked past it.

180
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:39,420
Speaker 1: Oh exciting Yeah, I was on my ways to flushing The Maker Faire cut through the park and then the park was full of maker.

181
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,730
Speaker 0: I thought you wanted like hurry up the show.

182
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,585
Speaker 0: But meanwhile here you are like The show.

183
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:48,260
Speaker 1: you said that right before we started was that wasn't set on the show so it wasn't canon sure fine.

184
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,448
Speaker 0: Then I'm gonna that I'm not gonna hurry up the showing a delay.

185
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:50,950
Speaker 0: So fine.

186
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,616
Speaker 0: I was I was gonna go.

187
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:53,238
Speaker 0: I went last year.

188
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:54,523
Speaker 0: It was cool.

189
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,391
Speaker 0: But it's I was thinking well this year.

190
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,580
Speaker 0: It's gonna be 90% the same stuff, right?

191
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,487
Speaker 0: So why?

192
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,100
Speaker 0: you know, maybe I'll go next year.

193
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,271
Speaker 1: It's your news the thing that you wanted to see.

194
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,477
Speaker 1: that now that you know, it was there.

195
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:05,080
Speaker 1: You should have gone.

196
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:05,823
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

197
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:06,265
Speaker 0: Okay.

198
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:13,120
Speaker 0: So one of the things that's all that was always there like the maker bots You know the the 3d printers, you know print out plastic shit, right?

199
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:20,338
Speaker 0: So this is really interesting article that brings up this question that I had not thought of right apparently, right.

200
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:26,539
Speaker 0: The question here is what if somebody prints out guns?

201
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,243
Speaker 0: Real gun.

202
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:29,892
Speaker 1: Oh, we already have laws about that.

203
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:31,540
Speaker 0: No, so check this out ready.

204
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:43,139
Speaker 0: So here's the first question right is as many layers to this right the people who host like the model files It's like should they host the model files for the different parts of the guns?

205
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,087
Speaker 1: Well, are we are so.

206
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:47,639
Speaker 1: are we gonna talk morally or legally?

207
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:50,962
Speaker 1: Legally?

208
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:56,757
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell I am NOT a lawyer of any stretch nor is Scott.

209
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:59,980
Speaker 0: according to this article It is not illegal really.

210
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,455
Speaker 1: Well, it depends because what I was gonna say is that there's regulation about certain kind of least.

211
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:05,860
Speaker 0: here's a quote from Brie Pettis.

212
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:10,431
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've already been through a few flame wars around what a weapon is.

213
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:17,357
Speaker 0: our take is that we'd rather you not upload weapons But we're not going to regulate it unless it's illegal, which it isn't.

214
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:21,615
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, the thing is is it illegal to forge your own sword?

215
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:22,920
Speaker 1: It depends on where you live.

216
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,572
Speaker 1: Maybe there's a law against having a blade that long.

217
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:26,155
Speaker 1: Maybe not.

218
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:27,140
Speaker 1: Maybe you can't carry it.

219
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:30,960
Speaker 1: There are some places where you can own a sword, but you can't carry it in public.

220
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:36,807
Speaker 1: I'm sure if I walked around Manhattan with a fully sharpened six foot long sword I would get stopped.

221
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:40,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably so but there's even here's an even deeper question, right?

222
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,039
Speaker 0: apparently two people have uploaded two parts to the to.

223
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,660
Speaker 1: Oh, I saw an article about this on FARC, right?

224
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,240
Speaker 0: One of the parts they uploaded was just for a magazine complete with spring.

225
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:55,471
Speaker 0: Alright, the second part was the ar-15 lower receiver.

226
00:11:55,551 --> 00:12:04,033
Speaker 0: Apparently the entire of the entire ar-15 Only the lower receiver is the part that you actually need like the.

227
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:05,197
Speaker 0: apparently the gun laws.

228
00:12:05,237 --> 00:12:06,200
Speaker 0: like they thought about this.

229
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:10,760
Speaker 0: If only they would think this hard about the tech laws.

230
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:11,120
Speaker 0: It you know.

231
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,828
Speaker 0: It's like they have gun experts through these gun laws.

232
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:14,356
Speaker 1: The gun laws get to the point to where there's.

233
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:19,860
Speaker 1: they list like six Aspects and if you have any N of them you are classified as an assault rifle, right?

234
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,500
Speaker 0: But it's like how come they have experts who in guns writing these gun laws?

235
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,360
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, they have like retarded homeless bums writing the computer laws.

236
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,205
Speaker 1: What the fuck.

237
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:40,720
Speaker 1: but anyway, so then it's got most gun people As I have heard them rant many times say that the gun laws are only impressive to people who don't understand guns Probably ludicrous to gun, but at least they put some thought into it.

238
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,840
Speaker 0: It's like here the lower receiver is the frame that holds together all the pieces of the firearm in the States.

239
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:48,540
Speaker 0: All the other pieces can be purchased without a permit over-the-counter or through the post.

240
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:53,860
Speaker 0: The lower receiver is the only part which requires a background check or any other kind of paperwork before purchase.

241
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:55,444
Speaker 0: Typically, it's made of aluminum.

242
00:12:55,845 --> 00:13:03,794
Speaker 0: a rifle with a lower receiver made of plastic can be perfectly functional and you can just download the Schematic of this part and print your print one out for yourself.

243
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:21,940
Speaker 0: You know what awesome it is kind of awesome, but here where's your Story about the diamond age where they you know guns lots of guns and some you know awesome nerds or evil crazy guys or militia Prints out like an armory's worth of assault, right?

244
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:32,760
Speaker 1: This is the maker blood that people like us and by us I mean anyone with an IQ above 70 who was ever for more than a fraction of a second considered the future of technology.

245
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:38,756
Speaker 1: Well, you know those ads like you wouldn't download a car and the common meme response is fuck you.

246
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:39,458
Speaker 1: I would if I could.

247
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:40,019
Speaker 0: that's right.

248
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:50,216
Speaker 1: So it's from the first dawn of man People have assumed that someday we will mass produce weapons in our homes without any difficulty whatsoever.

249
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:57,139
Speaker 1: I am play God I don't think anyone in a position of power Anywhere in the world?

250
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,396
Speaker 1: Understands the ramifications of that.

251
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:01,445
Speaker 0: They're not even thinking about it.

252
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:07,503
Speaker 1: The thing is we already can you know, I can make a bomb really easily It's true.

253
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:11,938
Speaker 1: So and I could make the gun myself, but here's it is a different thing.

254
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,500
Speaker 1: So here's the thing.

255
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:20,320
Speaker 1: making the bomb requires lab skills and and the components and knowing what you're making.

256
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:28,900
Speaker 1: Making the gun requires machining skills of some kind or extruding skills or manufacturing skills and the equipment and the instructions.

257
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:32,976
Speaker 1: This just requires the maker bot and the file.

258
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:33,920
Speaker 0: You need the bullets.

259
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:38,198
Speaker 1: You can just buy bullets bullets or actually you can just go buy them.

260
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:41,200
Speaker 0: Yeah See, I think what we need to do is you need to just get rid of all the gun laws.

261
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:45,236
Speaker 1: We'll be able to print bullets and only where you need gunpowder.

262
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:46,020
Speaker 0: You can't print gun.

263
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,027
Speaker 1: You can make gunpowder pretty fucking easily.

264
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:49,633
Speaker 0: I know but you can't print.

265
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:50,115
Speaker 0: it is the point.

266
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:50,436
Speaker 1: Not yet.

267
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:51,480
Speaker 1: You need a chemistry set.

268
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,760
Speaker 1: Scott, you're telling me we won't have chemical printers in the next hundred years.

269
00:14:55,182 --> 00:15:01,667
Speaker 0: So I'll just go and I'll take some atoms on my screen and I'll arrange them and I'll like take two I'll take two hydrogens and an oxygen.

270
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:03,554
Speaker 0: you'll buy push print and water comes out.

271
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:12,323
Speaker 1: I guarantee you within a hundred years we'll at least have maker bots where you give them a set of core components and they can make certain kinds of chemical reactions to Make certain materials.

272
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:17,639
Speaker 0: so I could go online and like get the the molecule of some medicine and like just print it out.

273
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:19,948
Speaker 0: I think it's like THC print it bitch.

274
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:21,253
Speaker 1: I think that's going to happen.

275
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:23,924
Speaker 1: want to get high give it a couple centuries That's gonna happen.

276
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:30,567
Speaker 1: The only thing that might stop it is energy depletion Because that'll probably be pretty energy intensive.

277
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:34,036
Speaker 0: I should just type in like, you know, just take like 900 protons.

278
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:36,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like go Nobel Prize.

279
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:41,968
Speaker 1: So What do we do about this?

280
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,379
Speaker 1: should we make a Thursday show about this?

281
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:44,906
Speaker 0: I just wanted to talk about it.

282
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:45,408
Speaker 0: cuz awesome.

283
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:46,251
Speaker 1: It is awesome.

284
00:15:46,894 --> 00:15:52,688
Speaker 1: Uh, I Have very conflicted opinions on it But I feel like here's the reality.

285
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:56,180
Speaker 1: much like I'm gonna take my the same stance I take with things like privacy.

286
00:15:56,383 --> 00:15:57,194
Speaker 1: I'm gonna take on this.

287
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,378
Speaker 1: Whatever regulation you make is pointless because it cannot stop it.

288
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:06,551
Speaker 0: Plastic is now no one's allowed to have plastic.

289
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,700
Speaker 1: All right, so they're gonna ban the plans.

290
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:11,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, they banned mp3 download.

291
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:12,470
Speaker 0: They're on torrent.

292
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:15,340
Speaker 0: Yeah use net you as a sneaker net.

293
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:18,314
Speaker 1: Yeah sneaker net somebody I mean think about it in Cuba.

294
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:19,399
Speaker 0: one guy has the plans.

295
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,968
Speaker 0: now The whole world has the plans.

296
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:23,000
Speaker 0: you delete them from the one spot.

297
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,844
Speaker 0: He just hosted them.

298
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:26,336
Speaker 0: from what I've read the whole world still has the plan.

299
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:27,139
Speaker 0: and North Korea?

300
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,510
Speaker 1: There's a thriving trade in USB sticks filled with data.

301
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,292
Speaker 0: No kidding.

302
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,960
Speaker 0: So yes, Lee TV shows and music.

303
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:40,480
Speaker 1: I love how the primary contraband in North Korea is South Korean movies.

304
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,812
Speaker 1: It's South Korean pop drama TV shows TV shows and news about the world.

305
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, but primarily South Korean pop dramas.

306
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:49,619
Speaker 1: Huh.

307
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:54,680
Speaker 1: So you're gonna download these plans and make an air 15 lower receiver.

308
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:57,655
Speaker 0: I don't have any of the other parts nor do it.

309
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,759
Speaker 0: Even if I had them I do not know how to put them together.

310
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,203
Speaker 1: I'm surprised.

311
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:04,494
Speaker 0: nor would I even know what kind of bullet to go hit that put in it.

312
00:17:04,596 --> 00:17:07,429
Speaker 1: if I even got that far You can figure that out with Google.

313
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,440
Speaker 0: I'm sure I could wait Scott.

314
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:12,780
Speaker 1: I thought counter-strike trained you to be a fucking killing machine.

315
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:16,540
Speaker 1: I thought that if you played counter-strike for more than five minutes, you were militarily trained.

316
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,506
Speaker 0: Do you got anyway got a gun?

317
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:28,539
Speaker 0: I can operate leaning back in a chair without any recoil Then Everybody is in big trouble if they are if they are evil.

318
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:34,956
Speaker 1: So I want to talk a little bit briefly about the whole Sony PSN TOS.

319
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:36,300
Speaker 0: All right, go for it.

320
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:47,544
Speaker 1: Now there's a lot of news about this and then it's interesting because the news everyone's focusing on is that they basically Prohibit you from suing them and it's a kind of well That was the change.

321
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:50,574
Speaker 0: all the other stuff in the TOS is it was there before.

322
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:58,659
Speaker 1: so while that is the change And I think there were some other changes too because they kind of rewrote it and they're also making you agree to it Or you can't use the service anymore.

323
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:05,279
Speaker 1: One as some journalists are the same as every other service as one journalist very pointedly and poignantly pointed out.

324
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:12,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, I learned about this because my ten-year-old son said that a window popped up and he clicked Okay to make it go away before the PlayStation would start this morning.

325
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,392
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

326
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,399
Speaker 1: So yeah click through whatever.

327
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:26,276
Speaker 1: but Because of all this there's a point in this TOS that I want to read to you verbatim Because I know how Microsoft handles this BS and we know how Nintendo handles this.

328
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,620
Speaker 1: it's Sony.

329
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:35,580
Speaker 1: It's like they tried to find the worst possible middle ground between these two ways of doing things.

330
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:41,520
Speaker 1: It's like they went out of their way to make the stupidest most unenforceable and arbitrary policy in the world.

331
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:57,920
Speaker 1: Okay You may not provide anyone with your name or any other personally identifying information other than your online ID nor the name password or personally identifying information of any other person or business through any means.

332
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:00,685
Speaker 0: Uh-huh So you cannot.

333
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:14,718
Speaker 1: basically if you have a handle your online ID in PSN It is against the terms of service and a kickable bannable offense to so much as reveal anything about yourself Where you live what your name is?

334
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:21,440
Speaker 1: Another handle you have an email address the name of any business whether or not it's related to you theoretically.

335
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:25,480
Speaker 1: According to this if you say the word Microsoft you should be banned.

336
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:28,616
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, if you say the word Sony you should be banned.

337
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:31,263
Speaker 0: All right It's ludicrous.

338
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,432
Speaker 1: I mean Nintendo just doesn't actually let you communicate with people.

339
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:37,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Microsoft is just a sea of dicks.

340
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:50,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the internet is just somehow I don't know if it's actually more or less dicks Because I found that Xbox Live tends to have more assholes than on Normal online play but I play in walled gardens.

341
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:53,800
Speaker 1: I play in like password-protected CS servers, and I don't know.

342
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,564
Speaker 1: I just find this Sentence ideas.

343
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:57,528
Speaker 0: I mean all.

344
00:19:57,668 --> 00:20:03,948
Speaker 0: every TOS you're ever gonna read Apple Nintendo my anybody is Full of evil and crazy stupid bullshit like this.

345
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:07,220
Speaker 0: Adobe sure right, but the Sony ones, right?

346
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:15,629
Speaker 0: It's like Sony has more so than any of these other companies cuz all companies have had huge fuck-ups in the TOS Department of like.

347
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,094
Speaker 0: oh my god.

348
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:16,680
Speaker 0: They're so evil.

349
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:21,586
Speaker 1: Sony goes above and beyond Sony Fuck up department.

350
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:23,151
Speaker 1: My job is to fuck up.

351
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:24,356
Speaker 0: Remember Apple was like.

352
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:29,030
Speaker 0: you can't make Software for the iPhone using it right and no.

353
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:30,435
Speaker 0: and Nintendo everyone had.

354
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:42,812
Speaker 0: so everyone has had their evil But Sony has had is the only one that has can had consistent streak of Evil over and over and over.

355
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:45,440
Speaker 1: It's not just evil without taking a break.

356
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:48,330
Speaker 1: It is evil followed up by incompetence.

357
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:49,795
Speaker 0: Yes, but you know, you can't.

358
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:51,321
Speaker 0: we can't tell which one it is Right.

359
00:20:51,341 --> 00:21:05,599
Speaker 0: we the old saying goes but regardless which whenever whether it's evil or incompetence Sony is the only company that has had a never-ending streak in that department going on What like ten plus years since I was in like high school.

360
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:14,398
Speaker 0: so Seeing that I don't know why people still give money to Sony for anything Well, they want to use their stuff.

361
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:16,867
Speaker 0: What stuff does Sony have that you need to use?

362
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:20,740
Speaker 1: maybe games that other people might like that are exclusive that you personally might not?

363
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,311
Speaker 0: Like for how many of those games are there?

364
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,456
Speaker 0: three depends?

365
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:26,497
Speaker 0: Yeah almost none.

366
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,786
Speaker 0: It's not worth it I just fight.

367
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:39,880
Speaker 1: I feel like in general the terms of service stuff when it comes to online stuff is So broken like we just talked about how broken gun laws are.

368
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,580
Speaker 1: I feel like all this stuff is just a giant catastrophe waiting to happen.

369
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:55,940
Speaker 1: I mean part of the terms of service says that I affirm that I'm at least 18 and Emancipated minor or possess legal parental or guardian consent, but if I'm not I can't have agreed to the contract anyway.

370
00:21:56,784 --> 00:22:02,632
Speaker 1: so TOS seemed to only exist to cover people's asses from liability.

371
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:05,120
Speaker 1: I don't feel like that liability should even exist.

372
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:14,946
Speaker 1: I don't feel like any online service should actually have any responsibility to do any checking or follow-up on the age or Locality or anything of its users.

373
00:22:14,987 --> 00:22:16,734
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is that there's actually laws about.

374
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:17,055
Speaker 0: I know

375
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:18,240
Speaker 1: I don't think there should be

376
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:19,583
Speaker 0: The

377
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:27,199
Speaker 1: fact that to go to a website that talks about beer if it's hosted in the US They tent like for like a beer distributor you have to say what your age is

378
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,268
Speaker 0: But you can watch a football game with a beer commercial

379
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,011
Speaker 1: or

380
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:31,598
Speaker 0: go to a football stadium with or

381
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:32,160
Speaker 1: Scott everywhere.

382
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:38,221
Speaker 1: I point out that every 13 year old in the world was born in January 1st 1901.

383
00:22:38,221 --> 00:22:44,056
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Think there's a much more elegant terms of service that we should use for just about everything with maybe minor improvements.

384
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:45,502
Speaker 0: use at your Own risk.

385
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:49,314
Speaker 1: don't cheat don't steal don't punch or kick people.

386
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't harass anyone.

387
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:52,808
Speaker 1: Don't spray paint on stuff.

388
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,354
Speaker 1: I guess in counter-strike.

389
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,600
Speaker 1: We need to be able to spray paint on stay.

390
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,285
Speaker 0: Hey, that's important.

391
00:22:56,587 --> 00:22:58,179
Speaker 1: Don't mess with things that aren't your.

392
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,448
Speaker 1: again I guess in counter-strike.

393
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:01,120
Speaker 1: I need to be able to mess with things that are mine.

394
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,085
Speaker 0: Well, there are yours.

395
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:04,760
Speaker 0: if you if I kill you I don't know all your stuff belongs to me.

396
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not how it works.

397
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,221
Speaker 0: But Scott.

398
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:07,306
Speaker 0: so I planted this bomb.

399
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:08,831
Speaker 1: you came over and started fucking with it.

400
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,160
Speaker 0: You put it on the ground still mine.

401
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,333
Speaker 0: I'm standing right next to it.

402
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,952
Speaker 0: No That's like move your feet lose.

403
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:17,725
Speaker 0: you see You're not touching.

404
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:18,912
Speaker 0: it is not yours Scott.

405
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:19,616
Speaker 1: That was my bullet.

406
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:21,830
Speaker 1: Give it back I'm touching.

407
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,458
Speaker 0: it is mine now.

408
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:35,711
Speaker 1: So things of the day It's metapony and that is related to ponies.

409
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:37,136
Speaker 1: It's not a pony much pony.

410
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:38,040
Speaker 1: It's a good thing though.

411
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,592
Speaker 1: So when Emily pointed this out, I had no idea.

412
00:23:40,773 --> 00:23:43,710
Speaker 1: even though I'm a fan of Barbra Streisand I just actually never heard this song.

413
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,878
Speaker 0: really the mega Streisand?

414
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:47,907
Speaker 1: I'm also you know what Scott?

415
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:51,400
Speaker 1: I am also a fan of meatloaf Bonnie Tyler and Cher.

416
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:57,899
Speaker 1: In fact, I actually really like Cher style concerts, okay, they're kind of like modern pop costume roof.

417
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:02,895
Speaker 1: anyway Any of you, you know what punk kids in the forum your whiny?

418
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,028
Speaker 1: Yima, whatever music it is.

419
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:07,839
Speaker 1: I guess dubstep is what you're all into now.

420
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:10,476
Speaker 1: Cher is better than dubstep.

421
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:25,580
Speaker 1: Okay, so The art of the dress a song about which many of you may be familiar Many of you are probably humming it right now or going on YouTube to listen to it So it gets stuck in your head is in fact based on a Barbra Streisand song.

422
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:28,600
Speaker 0: It's not every pony song is based on some other song exactly.

423
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:36,517
Speaker 1: so if you were into music It would be interesting for you to look at these two songs and then go check out all the other.

424
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:49,460
Speaker 1: like relations I did a week-long thing the day years ago where I took the song born to be alive and Followed it through the internet to its source through all the remixes and covers and mashups and everything.

425
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,400
Speaker 1: I did the same thing with another Russian song at one point and I don't remember even what it was called.

426
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:55,419
Speaker 1: Oh, those were the days.

427
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,080
Speaker 1: So it's a fun hobby of mine.

428
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:07,759
Speaker 1: So I'm giving you the pony version and the Barbra Streisand version and I encourage you to use these as seeds to do this To some other song or maybe this song.

429
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this isn't really, you know a typical thing of the day with like a funny video and all that stuff, right This is just a long.

430
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:25,937
Speaker 0: Well Meg, I guess New York Times magazine article, I guess it's one of those big long six pagers, but it's really fast words exactly words.

431
00:25:27,023 --> 00:25:28,227
Speaker 0: But basically the deal here.

432
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:32,160
Speaker 0: the summary is there's a guy and he was a foreign correspondent, right?

433
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:35,409
Speaker 1: And so he had oh, is this the high school football thing?

434
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,572
Speaker 0: no, okay, nevermind.

435
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:40,342
Speaker 0: so his job was to work in Russia Right.

436
00:25:41,004 --> 00:25:45,000
Speaker 0: So he had to take his family to Russia and he was like, oh, do I really want to do this?

437
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,492
Speaker 0: Should we just send them to an international school where everyone speaks English?

438
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:50,240
Speaker 0: or she sent him to the Russian school, right?

439
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:55,512
Speaker 0: so at first They were you know, they had a hard time.

440
00:25:55,552 --> 00:26:00,960
Speaker 0: They were like, alright, let's be badasses Let's send them to the you know to the Russian public school, right?

441
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,156
Speaker 0: That was bad didn't work out so well, huh?

442
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:05,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

443
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:11,580
Speaker 0: But then they were gonna send them to the international school.

444
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,100
Speaker 0: They were gonna give up right like Oz isn't working.

445
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,373
Speaker 0: but instead they sent him to this totally cool school.

446
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:21,100
Speaker 0: and the thing with this totally cool school is It was one of those situations.

447
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:27,308
Speaker 0: It was like one guy who was sort of like it was his school sort of I guess a John Taylor Gato of Russia maybe Bill Gates.

448
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:34,520
Speaker 0: no and Basically his idea, you know, he has ideas about how kids should learn and all that shit, you know.

449
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,420
Speaker 0: And it tells the story about the kids struggled but eventually unstruggled and the whole stuff.

450
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,877
Speaker 0: But was the thing that was most fascinating about this right which they didn't talk about too much.

451
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:48,639
Speaker 0: No was Some of the classes they had there.

452
00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:50,872
Speaker 0: They basically had classes on.

453
00:26:50,892 --> 00:26:51,898
Speaker 0: I can't see.

454
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:56,020
Speaker 0: I forgot I can't find in the article because it's six pages the Russian name they used for this class.

455
00:26:56,421 --> 00:27:06,858
Speaker 0: But it was basically the avoid bullshit class like how to detect coercion and Propaganda and not have it influence you because it's a Russian school.

456
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:17,211
Speaker 0: So the totally makes sense that this totally yeah, we need that here that this totally cool guy running the school is like yeah We're gonna have a class about not falling for bullshit.

457
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,057
Speaker 0: Yeah another cool thing in this.

458
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:24,430
Speaker 0: Yeah Another cool thing is they talk about how you know When the kids are having a hard time.

459
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:38,244
Speaker 0: one of the teachers for one of the kids Taught the whole class in English one day and was like, yeah, that's how it is for you know The American kid all you Russian kids Apparently and they says like one of the Russian kids was crying cuz he didn't know what's going on You know.

460
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:43,838
Speaker 0: and he was like, yeah, so that kids feeling every day cuz he doesn't know what the hell's going on So leave him alone.

461
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:48,959
Speaker 0: Anyway, it was really fascinating and It's cool.

462
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:56,580
Speaker 1: So very briefly in the meta moment the book club book which we'll be doing as soon as I finished reading it Which won't be that long is the ear the IVR my Nancy farmer.

463
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:01,060
Speaker 1: It's a future cyberpunk II sci-fi detective stories set in Africa.

464
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,250
Speaker 0: Someone is gonna make a fanfiction.

465
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:09,160
Speaker 0: It could be like, you know Mm-hmm what like the boob the butt the dick something like that.

466
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:10,683
Speaker 1: That that was.

467
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:22,556
Speaker 0: I thought you're gonna that okay, I was gonna say like if there are three-year-olds, you know Poop That's pretty much it.

468
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,192
Speaker 1: Gaming cons that are coming up in the near future.

469
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:27,116
Speaker 1: Well, not the near future.

470
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:33,474
Speaker 1: the nearest future Magfest is gonna be fucking awesome here because it's in the new venue.

471
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,019
Speaker 0: no cons for the rest of the year.

472
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:36,907
Speaker 1: Yep, mag fast though.

473
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:37,771
Speaker 1: It's coming.

474
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:38,133
Speaker 1: Yep.

475
00:28:38,374 --> 00:28:41,325
Speaker 1: I'm charging my laser Already charging.

476
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:42,873
Speaker 1: It's the only thing that moves the blob.

477
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:44,100
Speaker 0: My laser is already full.

478
00:28:46,581 --> 00:28:47,987
Speaker 0: I got a second laser coming.

479
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:51,060
Speaker 1: So long time ago at a I think it was PAX.

480
00:28:52,783 --> 00:28:54,630
Speaker 1: I think we picked this game up at a PAX or connect.

481
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,839
Speaker 0: This was like a PAX multi years ago.

482
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was called the hive or hi.

483
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,853
Speaker 0: Well, I was going recently.

484
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:01,877
Speaker 0: Let's find a two-player game.

485
00:29:01,897 --> 00:29:02,760
Speaker 0: We can play really quick.

486
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,985
Speaker 0: I think it was must have been packs.

487
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:06,636
Speaker 1: Oh wait or oh nine corollary that find a weird game.

488
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:08,363
Speaker 0: Yeah find a weird game We never seen before.

489
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:13,403
Speaker 0: so we're in the PAX library and I see a bat a game in our bag and I'm like That's a winner.

490
00:29:13,704 --> 00:29:17,960
Speaker 0: So I grabbed the game in the bag and we play it really quick and it was okay.

491
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:20,067
Speaker 0: Didn't really fully grasp it.

492
00:29:20,107 --> 00:29:21,413
Speaker 0: We were sucked.

493
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:23,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, we played it once like alright, whatever.

494
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,035
Speaker 1: Then we put it away and went to a concert or something.

495
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:25,660
Speaker 0: I don't know what we did.

496
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:35,500
Speaker 1: Oh, I remembered the game because every time went to a PAX I'd see it in the library like oh, yeah that game It's one of those games that you see around but you never play right?

497
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,270
Speaker 0: It's like when you go to a store, especially like a gaming store.

498
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,860
Speaker 0: There's the section or a comic store, especially.

499
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:43,520
Speaker 0: There's the section with the new stuff and it's always changing.

500
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:45,900
Speaker 0: So you're always looking there really closely to see the new stuff.

501
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,660
Speaker 0: But there's always that shelf where the stuff never gets bought and it's just sitting there with the same stuff on it.

502
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,261
Speaker 1: It's all the old war games and memoir 44.

503
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:56,613
Speaker 0: And you just sort of like you don't actually look closely at the shelf.

504
00:29:56,713 --> 00:30:09,320
Speaker 0: Your brain doesn't process each item It's just your brain remembers the shelf as a whole unit and you can use recognize it and you know You can immediately tell nothing has changed on it just by glancing because it matches your memory exactly.

505
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:14,523
Speaker 0: But if someone asked you name one thing on that shelf without looking at it you'd be like, uh Right.

506
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:16,274
Speaker 0: So the hive is one of those things like.

507
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:17,220
Speaker 0: you see it everywhere.

508
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:23,971
Speaker 0: There's a picture of it in your brain if you go to the game store But you never actually Look closely at it or even recognize it exists.

509
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:28,027
Speaker 0: and if someone like were to take it off the shelf and show it to you It would like disrupt your brain like what?

510
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:30,800
Speaker 0: Well, I like you couldn't even imagine that the shelf would move.

511
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:35,100
Speaker 0: I wonder if there's a name for this like a neurological or psychological thing, whatever chunking.

512
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:41,860
Speaker 1: I've heard people use to describe that but I don't know if that's a technical term or just What my AP bio brain stuff?

513
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:49,360
Speaker 1: My AP bio teacher called it chunking that your brain will Take a set and if it can chunk it down into like one discrete unit.

514
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:59,199
Speaker 1: That's much more efficient and then you'll remember the unit but maybe not any details of the unit Though a detail may trigger memory of the unit even though you don't know won't know why it triggered it.

515
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:05,638
Speaker 0: So anyway, the hive is one of those things where you'll see it But you won't actually look at it closely until we tell you to right now.

516
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:11,016
Speaker 1: So the hive is just a bag full of a bunch of tiles.

517
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,205
Speaker 1: they're all hexes And they're equal.

518
00:31:13,265 --> 00:31:15,053
Speaker 1: It's a perfect complete information game.

519
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:24,678
Speaker 1: It's completely symmetrical and The goal is to place your little Grasshoppers and aunties and beat least and then spiders and that's all the things.

520
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,060
Speaker 1: and it.

521
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,254
Speaker 1: well There's expansions like the mosquito and the ladybug.

522
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:28,039
Speaker 0: We got to get that shit.

523
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:43,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, people don't seem to like him that much whatever but your goal is to surround the other person's Queen bees around be to stay alive Without having your own bee be surrounded and it can be surrounded by tiles of either color.

524
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,079
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if the Queen bee is completely surrounded the Queen bee dies Yep.

525
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:55,820
Speaker 1: So beyond that every bug has a power and the game actually has a pretty unique starting like metrics or starting conditions.

526
00:31:55,921 --> 00:31:58,115
Speaker 1: So you place any bug that you want.

527
00:31:58,175 --> 00:31:58,679
Speaker 1: the first player?

528
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:01,331
Speaker 1: Second player places a bug has to be touching the first bug.

529
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:01,994
Speaker 1: They're all hexes.

530
00:32:02,276 --> 00:32:10,524
Speaker 1: from this point forward You can only play a tile if it is placed such that it does not touch any tile of another color Mm-hmm.

531
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:11,794
Speaker 1: So the other person's tiles.

532
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:17,020
Speaker 1: Yep You cannot move any bee any bugs until you place your Queen bee.

533
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:21,865
Speaker 1: once you have placed your Queen bee you can either place a guy or Move a guy.

534
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:24,180
Speaker 0: so now you play the bee first.

535
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:28,420
Speaker 0: You can just start playing and moving and all that you want like crazy.

536
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:31,918
Speaker 0: But if you play something else, you've got to play some.

537
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:38,820
Speaker 0: you know You got to either play the bee or play something else until the fourth turn Where if you haven't played the bee yet, you'll be forced to play it now.

538
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,064
Speaker 1: So that's the rub.

539
00:32:40,104 --> 00:32:45,947
Speaker 1: you must place the bee in one of your first four turn But you cannot matter which one.

540
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:48,440
Speaker 0: but also you can't you on your turn.

541
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,091
Speaker 0: Normally, you can move or place but I said that right.

542
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:54,940
Speaker 0: if you have not placed the bee you cannot move yet.

543
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:59,355
Speaker 1: And then it's just a game of maneuvering and every bug has a power.

544
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:02,245
Speaker 1: the ant can just move around the whole outside But not the inside.

545
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:04,512
Speaker 1: the beetle can walk on top of shit.

546
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:07,180
Speaker 1: the the bee moves like a chess king.

547
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,669
Speaker 1: He kind of bee kind of sucks.

548
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:09,172
Speaker 0: Yeah.

549
00:33:09,212 --> 00:33:10,580
Speaker 0: Well, the bee is the defendant.

550
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,320
Speaker 1: Yeah Grasshopper can only jump over any number of do in a straight line.

551
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:20,060
Speaker 1: Spider moves three like spaces around the outside of other tiles that we already ran into a spider problem.

552
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can't.

553
00:33:20,923 --> 00:33:23,691
Speaker 1: we came across an unresolvable spider situation.

554
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:26,037
Speaker 1: I have to go through the errata to figure out what to do.

555
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:41,440
Speaker 1: Yeah And So far it's a good game because I'm always a fan of the simple fairly abstract direct Competition to player complete perfect information games like oshi or the stick game, right?

556
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, is you have a game that's basically fundamentally the same as chess or go right?

557
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,542
Speaker 0: It's it's.

558
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:51,317
Speaker 0: you can see everything that's on the board, you know, every move the other person can make.

559
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:56,097
Speaker 0: there's nothing hidden You know and it's just moving pieces and placing pieces and you're trying to win and it's.

560
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:56,820
Speaker 0: everyone has it.

561
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,880
Speaker 0: Everyone has the same thing and the only difference is who goes first, right?

562
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,540
Speaker 0: The difference here is that you know chess and go have like a you know, such a huge play space.

563
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:11,092
Speaker 1: You know a solution space Coupled with the fact that good players are way above you.

564
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:15,940
Speaker 1: playing against someone who's good at chess is The same as playing against someone who's good at Street Fighter.

565
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:22,789
Speaker 0: But the games also while having such as big space of decision-making Also have a lot of pieces like there's a lot of.

566
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,078
Speaker 0: even a chess board has a lot of pieces on it.

567
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:29,440
Speaker 1: now chess Is more fun if you play it with someone who is at your skill level.

568
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:29,837
Speaker 0: Yeah

569
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:45,699
Speaker 1: But it does run into the problem of it'll take years to fully explore that play space a game like the hive or oshi If you're smart and you keep playing against one person or a few people over and over and over again You're gonna rapidly go through like phases of gameplay.

570
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,803
Speaker 0: We're already seeing that.

571
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:48,225
Speaker 1: Yep.

572
00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:53,159
Speaker 0: So we have the thing is a game like oshi or hive, right?

573
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,415
Speaker 0: Gives you quite a large decision space but a lot less pieces.

574
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:08,660
Speaker 0: It's like it's somehow it's like compressed You know because you have a less pieces on a smaller board But there's more complex rules perhaps or just the way the rules are.

575
00:35:09,263 --> 00:35:12,179
Speaker 0: You know, I mean that the fact that they're hexes and there's different tricks you can do.

576
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:14,788
Speaker 0: It's like you've managed to be able to get.

577
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:16,794
Speaker 0: you know, a very complex game.

578
00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:20,448
Speaker 0: Maybe not necessarily as complex as go But you can.

579
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:27,120
Speaker 0: it's easier to keep the whole game in your brain Even if you haven't studied it for years and years and years and it's also by being perfect and complete.

580
00:35:27,722 --> 00:35:33,960
Speaker 1: It's a game where you can fully analyze everything that is happening and everything that has happened.

581
00:35:34,481 --> 00:35:45,580
Speaker 1: And they're great games to teach you pattern recognition and you know gaming analytics game theory analyze You know analyzing data and patterns in game theory sense, even if you don't understand the math.

582
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:56,780
Speaker 0: And of course, they're two-player games which are rare and it's rare you get a good one and Very quick to learn and quick to play, you know people talk about easy to learn difficult to master.

583
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure, whatever quick to play is very important because otherwise you're sitting there for hours.

584
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:03,607
Speaker 1: You know the first time I heard that term.

585
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:04,069
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

586
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,474
Speaker 1: It's watching mask.

587
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:11,642
Speaker 1: Okay, m.8 at s.k And I think it was Matt tracker got into my miles what's his name's?

588
00:36:12,023 --> 00:36:13,467
Speaker 1: little motorbike II thing?

589
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:16,515
Speaker 1: and then he's like trying to shoot somebody with it.

590
00:36:16,856 --> 00:36:21,914
Speaker 1: and then the bad guy radios him and He's like, ah, you can see that is very easy to pilot.

591
00:36:22,256 --> 00:36:26,816
Speaker 1: a minute to learn But a lifetime to master they like blows him up or something.

592
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:27,338
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

593
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:41,753
Speaker 1: So in our playing of the hive I'm gonna say and I say this about every game like this This game is straight up the stick game in that its primary Pattern is between stable and unstable states.

594
00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:43,740
Speaker 1: unstable meaning one place.

595
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:53,345
Speaker 0: You put a link in the show to your stick game because I should people don't know I should make like a web Game, I should make the stick game online HTML 5 stick game.

596
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,713
Speaker 0: Yeah get put up against a random opponent.

597
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:57,619
Speaker 1: That'd be pretty easy to do.

598
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:03,895
Speaker 1: actually I'm not gonna do it, but be easy to do Okay, but anyway, so the game is stable and unstable.

599
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:15,900
Speaker 1: it becomes unstable Once one player has a direct path to victory as in they can just start attacking the other B in such a way that the First player cannot fill in or defend fast enough, right?

600
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,726
Speaker 0: It's like if you're beat.

601
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:18,579
Speaker 0: you remember you had to surround the B and it's a hex.

602
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:26,599
Speaker 0: You need six pieces around the B. So if your B has four around it and mine has three you're ahead by one it depending on whose turn it is.

603
00:37:27,282 --> 00:37:30,320
Speaker 0: You know, even if I go first, okay, so now we're even but then you're ahead.

604
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:38,680
Speaker 1: It's still stable if a player doesn't have a clear Immediate path to finishing the surrounding due to you know attack.

605
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,764
Speaker 1: Yeah You have to count.

606
00:37:39,864 --> 00:37:50,844
Speaker 0: basically what you end up doing is you look at how many things are already around your B. Then you see if you can maybe move your B. If you can move the B if it's not trapped yet, then that means you can probably Really?

607
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:52,580
Speaker 0: Fuck the other guy over thing is big.

608
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,299
Speaker 1: It's trapped like right away in the base game with it and there's not much you can do to avoid grasshopper, right?

609
00:37:58,663 --> 00:38:16,519
Speaker 0: but What you do is once the B's trapped you count how many actions it will take For the other guy to the complete surround the B and how many actions it'll you to take to completely surround his B If you did full offense and then you like I what are the alternatives that can occur here to maybe change those numbers?

610
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,349
Speaker 1: now It's funny that whenever Scott and I play games like this.

611
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:32,760
Speaker 1: They always go through the same pattern the first bunch of games I'll win them because it's a new game We haven't played before and Scott always tries to play a real strategy and I literally just look at the game and say how can I do the most aggressive?

612
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,440
Speaker 1: Just make the game as unstable and unpredictable and crazy as possible and then just hope that that'll make me win.

613
00:38:39,024 --> 00:38:45,223
Speaker 1: And in a game like this that'll work until we both know the game and then I'll lose an Equal number of games.

614
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:50,620
Speaker 1: following as Scott uses real strategy and my only one strategy no longer applies.

615
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,920
Speaker 0: And then you know since you know, we're both trying to figure of solve the game.

616
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,656
Speaker 0: It's like I'll just try crazy stuff and sometimes it works like my be ant ant ant.

617
00:38:57,857 --> 00:39:00,107
Speaker 1: That was a great move But then I came up with the counter.

618
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:07,084
Speaker 1: I can't win against it, but I can force a draw reliably Yeah, and then we also learned that like going first sucks Yeah We game.

619
00:39:07,124 --> 00:39:15,760
Speaker 1: we got into this pattern where you know I want a whole bunch of games and then Scott won a whole bunch and then we Alternated and then we realized we were only alternating because whoever went first always lost.

620
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:23,300
Speaker 1: So we started going first and trying different like patterns of play from going first to figure out if there's a way to escape.

621
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:33,277
Speaker 1: there's actually a very specific and direct way to win if you go second and The only way I can come up with to get out of it is to be able to force a draw.

622
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:35,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I've been.

623
00:39:35,942 --> 00:39:39,875
Speaker 1: I found myself going for the draw if I went first because I knew I couldn't win.

624
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:45,633
Speaker 1: I won one game Going first but that was the game where Scott tried some crazy bullshit.

625
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:46,576
Speaker 1: That was ill-advised.

626
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:47,860
Speaker 0: I was just trying it out.

627
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:49,629
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you can't get like.

628
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:58,100
Speaker 0: I tried my all spiders in the beginning strategy Something I noticed that happens in a lot of games right is like, okay, you've gotten to sort of a rut, right?

629
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,659
Speaker 0: You're using the same strategies over and over because you know, they've worked for you in the past or whatever teeny.

630
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:04,564
Speaker 1: I'm a huge victim of that.

631
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:06,930
Speaker 1: I will almost always play.

632
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:13,851
Speaker 0: you'll do what's familiar and safe and you can't risk Experimenting with the unfamiliar because you might lose.

633
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:16,939
Speaker 1: I always start in the middle with my red-black leaders I make the checkerboard.

634
00:40:17,844 --> 00:40:22,730
Speaker 0: So what you have to do is you just be like, alright, uh, you know This game is short enough.

635
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:24,122
Speaker 0: in a long game It's like.

636
00:40:24,142 --> 00:40:28,139
Speaker 0: you don't want to risk losing because it's for serious, but in a short game You can play it a bunch of times.

637
00:40:28,581 --> 00:40:31,450
Speaker 0: So you just just try crazy shit even like one round.

638
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:42,147
Speaker 0: just play randomly for like a few turns like, you know Just be like bug bug bug and then if you haven't gotten the B by the fourth turn bring it out and then You know just go for it.

639
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:45,820
Speaker 0: See see what you know, try to win with whatever you happen to play.

640
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:55,098
Speaker 1: Well, more importantly once you get once you get to an equilibrium where you know the people you're playing with victory seems to follow play order or victory seems to be pretty even.

641
00:40:55,118 --> 00:41:00,640
Speaker 1: or If you get to a stability point where one player is always winning

642
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:01,742
Speaker 0: Then

643
00:41:02,143 --> 00:41:12,854
Speaker 1: keep playing the game over and over again and iterate through starting strategies because the starting like two moves of this game Determine a good deal of what comes after and

644
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:17,967
Speaker 0: you'd be surprised You have to start reacting to what your opponent did immediately like.

645
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:24,615
Speaker 0: if you go second and The first thing he puts out is B. Well that you got to take that into account.

646
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:35,857
Speaker 1: that on your on your move yep, so choosing your second piece for example is I'd say probably 60 to 70 percent of the victory condition of the actual underlying game.

647
00:41:36,017 --> 00:41:41,360
Speaker 0: Yeah The other thing in this game right is that there's sort of these two aspects, right?

648
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,058
Speaker 0: There's the aspect of since you don't remove any bugs from the board But they do get trapped where they can't move.

649
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:51,790
Speaker 1: yeah Because you can't move a bug if it will disconnect the hive and make it two separate hives.

650
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,543
Speaker 0: It has to be one big hive and also You can't.

651
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:59,943
Speaker 0: a bug can be trapped like if it can't physically get out without bumping any other bugs out of the way Then it can't move.

652
00:42:00,746 --> 00:42:22,526
Speaker 0: so this that creates this aspect of geometry We're like regardless of which bugs are out there You have to make the board a certain shape to make a disadvantage of your opponent If too many of his bugs are trapped or you know holding the hive together on like a big long string then That those are bugs that can't attack your B And now you've got the advantage.

653
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,919
Speaker 0: another aspect of the game is the bug select.

654
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:29,132
Speaker 0: Is the is the bug selection?

655
00:42:29,152 --> 00:42:31,140
Speaker 0: there was a round where I was actually winning.

656
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:42,785
Speaker 0: I was gonna win, but but I had chosen grasshopper grasshopper grasshopper earlier Which means I didn't have any left and the only bug that I could have won with was grasshopper And I could have.

657
00:42:42,886 --> 00:42:44,875
Speaker 0: I didn't have to use the grasshoppers earlier.

658
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:48,489
Speaker 0: I just chose to stupidly When I should have.

659
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:56,561
Speaker 0: if I had used a beetle earlier Which I very well could have I would have won yep the geometry of the board will definitely matter when you get into more advanced Play.

660
00:42:56,581 --> 00:42:57,989
Speaker 1: if you play the game a whole bunch like try

661
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:05,168
Speaker 0: to move a bug next to my own B Just to allow my B to move yep Which you know works if no one's looking you

662
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:09,515
Speaker 1: want to move your B out as much as you can but a smart player is Gonna block you with an A and that's

663
00:43:09,535 --> 00:43:09,636
Speaker 0: true.

664
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,619
Speaker 0: But I mean if you think about the shape of it though right if there's you know it's a hex.

665
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:24,779
Speaker 0: So if you know you if you surround it on four sides out of five out of six it can move out of That center piece and go to the edge and now it's only surrounded on one side.

666
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:31,607
Speaker 0: It's like the ultimate killer move because now the guys fuck because he's he has Four or more bugs.

667
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:35,942
Speaker 0: you know committed to this line is this half circle of bugs.

668
00:43:36,183 --> 00:43:46,300
Speaker 0: they can't be split up because they're holding the hive together with your B at the very end and if you manage to pull that off you win, so In some if you're a board gamer at all just buy it.

669
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:59,680
Speaker 1: It's cheap, and it's one of those games you can just bring with you to like any event whip it out at a restaurant With just play it whenever it's great for like being in line at a con Or as a warm-up game while you're waiting for other people to show up to play a real game.

670
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:00,680
Speaker 0: This is the thing with the warm.

671
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:04,039
Speaker 0: There's been a lot of warm-up games lately and not enough hardcore games lately.

672
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,008
Speaker 1: Well, we're fixing that tomorrow.

673
00:44:06,129 --> 00:44:08,020
Speaker 1: our private board game night is Puerto Rico.

674
00:44:09,721 --> 00:44:10,167
Speaker 0: great.

675
00:44:10,228 --> 00:44:15,856
Speaker 0: the thing with the The warm-up games that there's so many of them and sort of like.

676
00:44:15,896 --> 00:44:16,440
Speaker 0: I'm tired of them.

677
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:17,999
Speaker 0: I want to play more real games.

678
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:24,660
Speaker 1: That's why you have so many so that you always have one you haven't played in a while That's true and also you got to have a variety of them like spot.

679
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:30,521
Speaker 0: It is good with a lot of people But the hive is good with two people and the hive is better is more brainy And the.

680
00:44:30,682 --> 00:44:32,570
Speaker 0: you know you get all kinds of different ones.

681
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,739
Speaker 1: Oh, she's good, but it does take too long.

682
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,652
Speaker 1: It's kind of a flawed game even though.

683
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:37,075
Speaker 1: I like it.

684
00:44:37,156 --> 00:44:49,477
Speaker 1: zero Was really boring to me until we played that tournament at PAX where the publisher was like Here's the tournament rules, and he made him up kind of on the fly Yeah, and they actually made for a really good tournament.

685
00:44:49,497 --> 00:44:49,960
Speaker 0: It was all right.

686
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like.

687
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:56,435
Speaker 1: I still love the fact that against these people we just randomly played against.

688
00:44:57,016 --> 00:45:02,040
Speaker 1: it was a perfect tie between you And me for first place, and we had to come down to like a sudden-death tiebreaker.

689
00:45:02,861 --> 00:45:05,391
Speaker 1: I was one fucking tile away from walling you off.

690
00:45:05,632 --> 00:45:06,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I couldn't keep it up.

691
00:45:07,058 --> 00:45:10,988
Speaker 0: no Yeah, so the hive is pretty awesome.

692
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,115
Speaker 0: buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz.

693
00:45:13,396 --> 00:45:15,242
Speaker 0: I don't know about the expansions though I want to try them out.

694
00:45:15,283 --> 00:45:18,334
Speaker 0: mosquito the ladybug are the rules for them online.

695
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:19,719
