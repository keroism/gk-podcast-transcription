1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,425
Speaker 0: it's Tuesday July 25th 2023.

2
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:13,112
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:22,915
Speaker 0: tonight we're talking about can't stop and all my diamonds let's do this.

4
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:26,086
Speaker 0: oh yeah I haven't done a show in a minute.

5
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,513
Speaker 0: we uh we had a vacation.

6
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:28,479
Speaker 0: we actually went away.

7
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:30,749
Speaker 1: well you know it's uh.

8
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:39,042
Speaker 1: we thought hey you know we're not doing anything but working but actually you know stuff keeps happening right and run out of show ideas.

9
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:43,656
Speaker 1: also holidays and yeah whatever.

10
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:44,960
Speaker 1: no one's paying us to do this.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:52,004
Speaker 0: so indirectly via YouTube premium and advertisers people are paying us dozens of dollars to do this.

12
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:55,395
Speaker 1: yeah okay well you know I'm not seeing any of that.

13
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,208
Speaker 0: it's got its cover in the Libsyn and a couple other things.

14
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:05,010
Speaker 0: but yeah we uh that was a longer hiatus than we've taken in a while.

15
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:10,535
Speaker 0: so everything that happened whatever we don't talk about today is gonna be forgotten.

16
00:01:10,556 --> 00:01:15,486
Speaker 0: we will never think of it again and we'll be struggling to come up with what to say at the start of the next geek night.

17
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:19,425
Speaker 1: the next to the next show will only have two days of material to look back at.

18
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,141
Speaker 0: we're like a cue that flushes itself on access every time.

19
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:26,856
Speaker 0: if we pull stuff out of the stack the rest of the stack gets dropped?

20
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,878
Speaker 1: yeah pretty much it's only what has happened since the last time we spoke.

21
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,099
Speaker 1: right.

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,311
Speaker 1: but I mean you know that's not it's really how.

23
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:33,995
Speaker 1: radio era.

24
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:40,783
Speaker 1: if we were some morning radio show yeah you would only talk about even if they took a hiatus and came back.

25
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:45,587
Speaker 1: it's like you'd only talk about what happened yesterday unless it was something that was so big.

26
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:52,499
Speaker 0: but the line for what is so big is so high for geek nights or for me and Scott in particular at least right.

27
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,177
Speaker 1: I mean you know you would only talk about the past if like your topic was.

28
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:59,890
Speaker 1: you know if you had a main bit you know it's a anyway yep.

29
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:06,459
Speaker 0: but so where we where we vacation was actually moderately interesting because I did just on Airbnb.

30
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:06,619
Speaker 0: like.

31
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:14,095
Speaker 0: it's not like don't think that I pulled strings or anything but on Airbnb I was looking for a place that would fit like you know 20 ish people.

32
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:25,415
Speaker 1: well here's the thing is if you want to have a part if you want to get an Airbnb that has a lot of people right and it doesn't get you kicked out for partying and cramming in too many people yeah you really only have two choices.

33
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:28,752
Speaker 1: choice number one is like big mansion for a lot of money right?

34
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:30,260
Speaker 1: oh there's three choices actually.

35
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:39,257
Speaker 1: the second choice is some sort of compound campground cult place right where there's many small houses and like maybe a main meeting house.

36
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:41,853
Speaker 0: I should see if we could rent an old cult compound some year.

37
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:44,086
Speaker 1: oh there's plenty of those you can get like in the Catskills.

38
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:45,474
Speaker 1: yeah all kinds of anyway.

39
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:52,908
Speaker 1: and the third option which is the option we tend to go for is basically building that used to be a brothel even though no one says so.

40
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:54,675
Speaker 1: the read.

41
00:02:54,715 --> 00:03:08,002
Speaker 1: the way you can tell that the building used to be a brothel is that the bottom floor right will have large social rooms big dining rooms living rooms a big kitchen that can serve many people.

42
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:10,230
Speaker 1: right that that's kind of place.

43
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,044
Speaker 1: and upstairs right we'll have many small bedrooms right.

44
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:17,039
Speaker 1: the place we stayed at technically was like what civic hat?

45
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,220
Speaker 0: right?

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,663
Speaker 0: so it was.

47
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:19,334
Speaker 0: I actually know the full history of this house.

48
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:23,213
Speaker 0: this was not brothel though it has the similar format to a bra.

49
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,926
Speaker 1: I think it was a brothel and they just refused to say so.

50
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:27,555
Speaker 0: well it was sort of a rate.

51
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:32,512
Speaker 1: they have scrubbed their history - right I'll go a little.

52
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:32,893
Speaker 0: why?

53
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:36,164
Speaker 1: why would a civic house have all those bedrooms upstairs?

54
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:37,468
Speaker 1: that makes no sense.

55
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:39,415
Speaker 1: so why would have any bedrooms?

56
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:53,296
Speaker 0: while I am confident that brothel like things have occurred at many points in this house's history this type of beach house was very common in America on the Jersey Shore and basically rich people like the guy who built this house.

57
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:54,863
Speaker 1: yes brothels were common.

58
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:56,631
Speaker 0: no this was his house.

59
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:57,796
Speaker 0: he was the first mayor.

60
00:03:57,816 --> 00:04:01,170
Speaker 0: basically he founded Wildwood and this was his house.

61
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:07,272
Speaker 0: but he structured it as a civic club because he would invite prominent politicians and famous people.

62
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:12,898
Speaker 0: they felt hey New Jersey come stay in my house like Woodrow Wilson wasn't president.

63
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,150
Speaker 0: when he was staying there he was like the governor of New Jersey.

64
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:18,125
Speaker 1: yes he was visiting a problem just like everyone did.

65
00:04:18,386 --> 00:04:20,374
Speaker 0: this was not a brothel that stage.

66
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:39,940
Speaker 0: well I see the pattern because the stage now a stage stage but this house was used in the 30s and 40s for a lot of weddings and also civic clubs would basically have their meetings there with the blessing of whoever owned the place at the time.

67
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:40,462
Speaker 0: there was all.

68
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:41,566
Speaker 0: there's all history to it.

69
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,860
Speaker 0: yes but no finding a. finding the house.

70
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,994
Speaker 1: it was many small bedrooms upstairs.

71
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:49,199
Speaker 0: I mean they weren't that small.

72
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,573
Speaker 0: this was more like think of it more like there was a.

73
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:51,956
Speaker 1: there was it.

74
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:54,914
Speaker 1: there was a hallway off the main hallway that had like three tiny bedrooms in it.

75
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:58,216
Speaker 0: well that's like that's for like the valleys of the rich people who were staying here.

76
00:04:58,478 --> 00:04:59,624
Speaker 0: this is brothel adjacent.

77
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:00,829
Speaker 0: this was rich.

78
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,909
Speaker 0: people are coming to Wildwood and staying there as part of political shenanigans.

79
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,582
Speaker 0: this is this is grass and against stages and shenanigans.

80
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:10,928
Speaker 1: all right anyway anyway.

81
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:11,912
Speaker 0: but the water.

82
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:21,179
Speaker 1: the point is we've gotten at least two if not more air B&Bs of this name I mean the waterfall house was not best one because the waterfall house waterfall house was the same exact.

83
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:28,595
Speaker 1: it wasn't the same exact layout but the same principle of at the bottom there were large large spaces and upstairs many small bedroom.

84
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:44,780
Speaker 0: well I think the key was that upstairs the many small bedrooms were all connected to a room that had a large stage on it and the bedrooms were about the size of a small twin bed each and the owners were like yeah this was a fucking brothel.

85
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,663
Speaker 0: you want to know the history.

86
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:53,732
Speaker 0: but to give you all a vision of this that house that waterfall house not the one we stayed in a wild with the waterfall house.

87
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:58,614
Speaker 0: it looked a lot like the house in phantasmagoria

88
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:10,126
Speaker 1: like yeah if you want to stay an Airbnb with all a lot of many friends right find a house an old one that used to be a brothel and everything about it will be great except for the fact that it's old.

89
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:11,797
Speaker 1: but you're not staying there that long.

90
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:12,622
Speaker 1: so who really cares?

91
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:14,711
Speaker 0: yep it was a pretty cool place.

92
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:16,017
Speaker 0: I would stay there again.

93
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:26,948
Speaker 0: and of course we're worried like oh it's a face of semi-famous historic house and the owners are really like oh you guys are old right and I literally described like look I work in capital markets.

94
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:28,858
Speaker 0: we're a bunch of aging sedate nerds.

95
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:30,104
Speaker 0: we're not gonna throw a party.

96
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:36,734
Speaker 0: and afterward they sent me a message that was like holy shit you guys took care of this house like you.

97
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:37,920
Speaker 1: mess up our hat what you didn't.

98
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,823
Speaker 0: mess up our house.

99
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:42,415
Speaker 1: yep it's just like it was when we left.

100
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:43,238
Speaker 1: it can great.

101
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:58,766
Speaker 0: they also while they were like no parties no like strict everything we found when we got there several packages of glow-in-the-dark ping-pong balls yet no ping-pong table which is some environmental storytelling as to what whoever stayed there last use this house for.

102
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:11,150
Speaker 0: so in the news you know I'm a big fan of overwatch the game but you might have noticed I don't talk a lot about overwatch league like I'll watch games.

103
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:14,283
Speaker 1: well you know we talked about it a bit back in the day.

104
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:20,104
Speaker 0: yeah but in terms of like I guess I am not a back in the day like one two years ago.

105
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:31,794
Speaker 0: I have never been a fan of an eSports team or person to the degree that I've been a fan of even like an amateur sports team like real physical hitting people type sports at any point.

106
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:34,003
Speaker 1: none of them have really done anything to like.

107
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:41,025
Speaker 1: you know engender you know loyalty history like all I care about them.

108
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:47,698
Speaker 0: like overwatch league literally didn't care who won I just watched the matches because I wanted to see the top tier of play.

109
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,251
Speaker 0: like that is all I wanted out of a professional league.

110
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:57,123
Speaker 1: they're like there was a New York team and I was like oh sure yeah and I was like oh we should check out that New York team.

111
00:07:57,184 --> 00:08:00,001
Speaker 1: but then there was really nothing New York about them except their name.

112
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:06,650
Speaker 0: nope because almost all the players were from overseas anyway and all the games were having on the West Coast for reasons.

113
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:14,719
Speaker 0: and then COVID happened and long story short overwatch league for a previous economic era.

114
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:27,822
Speaker 0: when I say previous I mean like just recently because things have shifted radically just in the last couple of years they were doing everything right like many eSports leagues were in terms of you mirror what professional sports are doing.

115
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:30,897
Speaker 0: yeah act like it's bigger than it is till it becomes bigger.

116
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:43,030
Speaker 0: you get the money from the sponsors like they were structuring it like sports and they were trying to emulate the things that make sports fandom successful and in that previous economic climate I don't think that was a bad bet.

117
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:54,062
Speaker 0: the problem is that entire ecosystem in both real sports and eSports relies on exactly one source of dollars.

118
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:58,680
Speaker 0: that matters and that source of dollars is sponsorships and advertising.

119
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:02,518
Speaker 1: and guess what you could also you can also get a TV deal but the TV.

120
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,592
Speaker 1: no one's gonna give you the TV deal unless they can get the ads.

121
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:13,470
Speaker 0: yeah all the ways you can think of to monetize this other than direct selling merch which being in the t-shirt business is not the way you want to be.

122
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:16,164
Speaker 0: being in the other way is the way you want to be.

123
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:29,805
Speaker 1: the other thing you can do with sports is sell tickets to attendance but eSports can never really do that like once a year for like their lol dota championships and I don't know how if that's still any of it then like as much as I like.

124
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:39,003
Speaker 0: overwatch is my favorite multiplayer competitive game right now by a wide margin but even there there is zero reason to see that in person.

125
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:45,595
Speaker 0: I want to sit in a room with a bunch of people watching people sit on a stage where otherwise I could be sitting at home with five camera angles.

126
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,544
Speaker 1: right it's like you need.

127
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:48,428
Speaker 1: you know.

128
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:49,613
Speaker 1: regular sports.

129
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:57,644
Speaker 1: it's like yes you can watch it with ads and then we can we actually have a superior way to experience spectation.

130
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:02,728
Speaker 1: yeah right that cannot be rivaled and cannot be pirated or duplicated unless you pay money.

131
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:05,462
Speaker 1: and that is coming to see it with your own eyeballs.

132
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:05,763
Speaker 1: right.

133
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:09,157
Speaker 1: and even if it's not better it's at least different.

134
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,491
Speaker 1: yeah in a meaningful way that you might be willing to pay.

135
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:17,082
Speaker 0: like American football it's kind of objectively worse unless you're looking for specific things out of the experience.

136
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,516
Speaker 0: or you are very rich but or your team's terrible.

137
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,504
Speaker 1: but you know hockey is just better.

138
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:31,133
Speaker 1: tennis is usually just better not that it's bad on TV right baseball is not so much better but different and has charms.

139
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:35,208
Speaker 0: it says that is a very diplomatic way to put that.

140
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:36,776
Speaker 1: but yeah it's like there's.

141
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:42,219
Speaker 1: there are reasons to attend live sporting events and pay money for it and it's not a waste of.

142
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:50,246
Speaker 1: but attending eSports in person might actually just be worse than watching at home on your computer yep.

143
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:55,347
Speaker 0: so uh Overwatch League was doing everything right but the advertisers dried up.

144
00:10:55,848 --> 00:11:02,832
Speaker 0: advertising in sports is down from the data I was able to pull up preparing to talk about this.

145
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:12,771
Speaker 0: advertising in eSports has except gambling ads yeah gambling ads but that's it's gambling ads car ads beverage ads pretty much nothing else.

146
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:17,107
Speaker 0: actually the bifurcation of the advertising market is kind of nuts.

147
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:25,155
Speaker 0: total aside gold ads like invest in gold literally only exist in Fox News and no other networks.

148
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:26,700
Speaker 1: yeah that makes sense.

149
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,801
Speaker 0: yep that makes a lot of sense and the more you think about it the more sense it makes.

150
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:30,323
Speaker 0: so.

151
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:35,304
Speaker 0: but meanwhile Google just announced Google search making more money than ever.

152
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:37,375
Speaker 0: their ads are doing better than everyone else.

153
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:39,326
Speaker 0: so I think and now it's speculation.

154
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,706
Speaker 1: here's what I move with all their even though search results are getting worse.

155
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,155
Speaker 0: yeah search results are getting worse.

156
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:48,997
Speaker 0: I think it's just my suspicion is very specific but this is just speculation.

157
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:50,984
Speaker 0: my bet is across the board.

158
00:11:51,586 --> 00:12:11,164
Speaker 0: everyone is reducing advertising for a lot of reasons but I think they're sending a higher percentage of their remaining advertising to the small number of advertising venues that they believe have the highest return which I say it's like our places that buy ads decreasing their ad budget.

159
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:12,630
Speaker 1: or are they redirecting it?

160
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,795
Speaker 0: yep or both.

161
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:23,616
Speaker 0: and I do think both because I saw a lot of numbers arguing that the overall advertising spend in America is dropping and consolidating right cuz.

162
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:25,787
Speaker 1: see this is the thing is like when you have a big company.

163
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:29,751
Speaker 1: it's like they just sort of decide like at the beginning of the year or me you know.

164
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:42,710
Speaker 1: maybe if the quarter if they're really micromanaging it like we are going to spend X dollars on buying ads the end right and it's like then the people who in the marketing department their job is to spend all of those dollars right.

165
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:48,058
Speaker 1: so it's like if they're left with like a million dollars at the end it's they're just like oh what should we do?

166
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:49,285
Speaker 1: let's go let's just fight.

167
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:52,240
Speaker 1: there's constantly finding ways to spend that money right.

168
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:53,225
Speaker 1: it's like they're not.

169
00:12:53,265 --> 00:13:00,941
Speaker 1: you know they are to some extent trying to measure the effectiveness and get the most bang for their buck but in a lot of cases not really.

170
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,127
Speaker 1: they're just trying to spend it all.

171
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:18,325
Speaker 0: but so eSports we're kind of a bubble for advertising in that they're unlike other places you could put an ad that is an untested place like I. personally don't think ads are very effective in a lot of venues.

172
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:25,711
Speaker 0: but eSports don't even have the the veneer of a history of generating a return on investment.

173
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:39,447
Speaker 0: and the kinds of people who are into eSports and AGDQ type things like video gaming in any capacity in a serious or elevated context are also the kinds of people who block ads or don't want to see ads and done

174
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,819
Speaker 1: oh maybe but I mean I think it's just simple.

175
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:51,165
Speaker 1: is that like hey you know the eSports had a bunch of viewers right the viewership was a big enough number that they could go to a sponsor and say hey do you want to sponsor this?

176
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:51,668
Speaker 1: no one else's.

177
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,237
Speaker 0: and the viewership is huge.

178
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:57,314
Speaker 0: the viewership remains high despite the drop in advertising right.

179
00:13:57,575 --> 00:14:01,315
Speaker 1: so someone says all right no one's ever advertised on this before right?

180
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:02,783
Speaker 1: we don't know if it's gonna work or not.

181
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:04,633
Speaker 1: but we see the eyeball numbers are big.

182
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:11,507
Speaker 1: so yeah I'll give you some money I'll be I'll put my logo up there big time I'll sponsor you big time and we'll see what happens.

183
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:14,402
Speaker 1: and then they see what they give it some time right they don't?

184
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:21,618
Speaker 1: they you know and they see what happens and then they decide hey this wasn't worth it I'm gonna not renew this deal bye-bye right.

185
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:23,627
Speaker 1: and then they're in trouble because it's like.

186
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:31,464
Speaker 1: well they didn't renew the deal and now getting someone else but like bye I get you know you know you can't get that person to buy.

187
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:34,217
Speaker 1: to getting anyone else to buy is not much more difficult right?

188
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,362
Speaker 1: if the first person had renewed everyone else would say oh that must be a good deal.

189
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:41,109
Speaker 1: I got to get in on that too.

190
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:42,334
Speaker 1: right and it's.

191
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,419
Speaker 1: it's a very snowball.

192
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,524
Speaker 1: one direction or the other.

193
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,674
Speaker 1: it snowballs uphill or now.

194
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:48,601
Speaker 0: so I did see another number.

195
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:54,419
Speaker 0: this was from a news source that I don't have secondary car like this.

196
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:55,745
Speaker 0: I'm reporting a direct number.

197
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:59,523
Speaker 0: I saw from a disclosure but I haven't read like reporting around it yet.

198
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:28,444
Speaker 0: but it's stated very specifically that viewership of twitch and YouTube game streams are both significantly down in 2023 compared to 2022 2021 2020 and it seems to correlate specifically to when people started going out and doing things again after COVID winds down slowly and the streaming were like.

199
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:31,398
Speaker 0: people are streaming less now than they did before COVID.

200
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:38,710
Speaker 0: in the context of video games at least now that is hard because this is like a disclose a financial disclosure type number.

201
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:48,169
Speaker 0: it's hard to like twitch and YouTube like you could probably make up numbers based on their data to say any story you want about trends and viewership.

202
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,658
Speaker 0: but I feel like we might see that the streaming world has shrunk a little bit as people go outside again.

203
00:15:56,003 --> 00:16:02,873
Speaker 0: hmm so there's even worse stuff going on in eSports because independent of that Overwatch League was already in trouble for a bunch of other reasons.

204
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:09,187
Speaker 0: remember a while back like we basically said Blizzard games can't be in China anymore because of that drama with NetEase.

205
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:17,646
Speaker 0: so the Chinese Overwatch teams were kind of in a pickle because how are they gonna practice if the game is not available legally in their country?

206
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:21,627
Speaker 0: so one of the Chinese teams just said fuck it and quit the league like they just gave up.

207
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,653
Speaker 1: yeah they can't.

208
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,000
Speaker 1: why waste your time right?

209
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:24,603
Speaker 1: it's like you got.

210
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:25,388
Speaker 1: you got life to live.

211
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:25,931
Speaker 1: you got to go.

212
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:27,137
Speaker 1: you know eat get food.

213
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:28,546
Speaker 1: yep you got to go play.

214
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:30,298
Speaker 1: if you're gonna play games you gotta at least play.

215
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,204
Speaker 1: pick a different game right?

216
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,491
Speaker 1: you got to start practicing.

217
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:35,166
Speaker 1: every day you don't play a different game you're falling behind.

218
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:45,498
Speaker 0: what are you gonna do like go to a camp like in the US or Europe or like Singapore to train for your video game for your right for your whole you know to invest your life like that.

219
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:46,724
Speaker 1: it's like you know you can't.

220
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:52,034
Speaker 1: you know there has to be some sort of you know light at the end of the tunnel to for to be worth that investment.

221
00:16:52,174 --> 00:17:00,972
Speaker 1: some people do that for something like an Olympic gold medal which you know ends up not actually getting you much money or any money like there's a.

222
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:08,558
Speaker 0: I feel like a lot of people think it's worth it to be able to doing it right but but other people?

223
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:21,101
Speaker 1: well yeah I'll dedicate my entire life to playing baseball because if I if I do it right yeah I'll make tens of millions of dollars and you'll get Michi flower power who dedicates his entire life to Super Mario 3. all right it's like you know.

224
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:28,431
Speaker 1: but if you if dedicating your life to overwatch has no way of paying out why the fuck you know would you do it?

225
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:31,082
Speaker 1: I beyond the level to which you simply enjoy play?

226
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:42,504
Speaker 0: I love overwatch and I think it is an expertly designed game but at the same time I spend like several hours a week playing it tops and it's my top competitive game.

227
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:47,366
Speaker 0: so not high not super high on the priority list of trying to get better than like silver or gold.

228
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:52,547
Speaker 0: but anyway overwatch league is in trouble for unrelated reasons.

229
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:56,949
Speaker 0: it hasn't been going well for all these different things that I'll link to some articles you can read.

230
00:17:56,989 --> 00:18:06,969
Speaker 0: but basically they are the all the teams have to vote on whether or not they're going to continue the league under an amended operating agreement.

231
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:13,840
Speaker 0: and basically to summarize the teams can either vote to continue to be an overwatch league or they can vote.

232
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:20,708
Speaker 0: they can decide individually to accept a six million dollar termination payment from Blizzard and then shut.

233
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:21,431
Speaker 1: it's pretty good.

234
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:22,314
Speaker 1: well pretty good.

235
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:37,694
Speaker 0: so that's six million payable to each one of these teams is as best I can tell sort of a consolation prize to make up for the fact that they all paid significantly higher fees to be a team in the first place.

236
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:38,658
Speaker 1: and now the week is.

237
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:40,347
Speaker 1: I thought they were I thought it was all.

238
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,434
Speaker 1: all the teams were.

239
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:42,098
Speaker 1: oh I didn't realize.

240
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:43,426
Speaker 1: the teams that individual ownership.

241
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:43,788
Speaker 0: oh there's.

242
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:46,303
Speaker 0: there's the whole franchise agreement and there's a lot.

243
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:47,768
Speaker 0: there's a lot.

244
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:53,796
Speaker 0: they really doubled down on structuring this like quote real sports which well that's the thing is that you know.

245
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:56,931
Speaker 1: but real sports there are two different ways to do real sports.

246
00:18:57,132 --> 00:19:10,593
Speaker 1: one is where the league owns all the teams and the other way is where all the teams are individually owned and usually when you're just starting out you'll have the league own all the team until they have lots and lots of value.

247
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:12,258
Speaker 1: right and it's like you know.

248
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,347
Speaker 0: and then what will the rich person be like?

249
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,140
Speaker 0: I would like to have an eSports team.

250
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,928
Speaker 0: here's four hundred million dollars.

251
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:20,636
Speaker 0: give me one right.

252
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:21,460
Speaker 1: or imagine if you know.

253
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,069
Speaker 1: just think of a sport a league.

254
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:24,638
Speaker 1: you already know baseball right.

255
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:27,935
Speaker 1: it's like okay the major league baseball owns every single.

256
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:35,667
Speaker 1: this never worked that way but major league baseball owned all the teams and then it's like the Yankees become the fucking Yankees.

257
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:40,048
Speaker 1: and it's like hey someone comes along and it's like yeah I can buy the Yankees.

258
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:41,193
Speaker 1: it's like now you can.

259
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,178
Speaker 1: it's like oh shit.

260
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:43,946
Speaker 1: and then people start bidding for it.

261
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:47,844
Speaker 1: right and then the league ends up just selling off all the teams.

262
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:56,572
Speaker 0: and that's sort of like the IPO yeah of the league because you're hoping in the secondary market potential expansions down the road league fees like all the monitors.

263
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,518
Speaker 0: there's a lot of a lot of ways.

264
00:19:57,558 --> 00:19:59,409
Speaker 1: well the league itself would not be you know that's.

265
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:05,713
Speaker 1: the other thing is that you know sports leagues are usually nonprofits.

266
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:11,058
Speaker 1: right it's the teams that are supposed to be profitable right and the league is just sort of this governing body.

267
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:16,406
Speaker 1: but when you have it an e-sport there's a and you have the company that makes the game running the e-sport.

268
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:24,776
Speaker 1: the e-sport is a marketing arm that's supposed to make money for the company by you know selling copies of the game.

269
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:35,108
Speaker 1: but also they're hoping to make money off the e-sport part directly and it's like if you're the governing body it's like no you're just sort of running a league and the teams are supposed to make money.

270
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:40,614
Speaker 1: and if you're a video game company with a profit motive you can't really operate something like that.

271
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:47,162
Speaker 1: but so reporting sport always has to be a specific game which is gonna be a game made by a for-profit.

272
00:20:47,202 --> 00:21:01,685
Speaker 0: come reporting from the second half of last year claims that Activision Blizzard was owed four hundred million dollars in unpaid franchise fees for overwatch and Call of Duty leagues and they had postponed all those payments due to kovat.

273
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:06,446
Speaker 0: but now the leagues aren't doing well and like more nonsense is about to happen.

274
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,498
Speaker 1: yeah I think you know eSports in general.

275
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:22,591
Speaker 1: I don't know how well I'm not paying attention to all the eSports but what it feels like to me based on you know the eSports that I do see is that you know no individual there are some legal edges is still big.

276
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:24,580
Speaker 1: the fortnight's are still big right.

277
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:24,962
Speaker 1: there's still.

278
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:25,746
Speaker 1: there's still big one.

279
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:29,465
Speaker 0: they're not big like the league's wanted them to appear.

280
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,193
Speaker 0: they're not big like sports sports.

281
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:33,465
Speaker 1: they're big in some places to some audiences.

282
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:44,489
Speaker 1: the fighting games are big right but I think what's happened is that people are competing at lots and lots of games right in small highly organized communities.

283
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:49,872
Speaker 1: if you go on twitch you can see competitions and tournaments and all kinds of things.

284
00:21:49,993 --> 00:21:51,258
Speaker 1: forget the random.

285
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:52,966
Speaker 0: look at the randomizer communities.

286
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:55,438
Speaker 0: those are fully formed eSports leagues.

287
00:21:55,478 --> 00:21:57,326
Speaker 0: they're just tiny right.

288
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:58,872
Speaker 1: they're just tiny and I think there's just.

289
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:09,829
Speaker 1: there's an extremely long tale of very healthy eSports that are not in any one of them individually is not enough to make money for real.

290
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:18,219
Speaker 0: it could make plenty of money for humans and life but not enough money for capital to give a shit right.

291
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:37,232
Speaker 1: so it's like competing at video games is maybe healthier than it's ever been but making a single video game that is a you know thing unto itself with it with a professional competitive thing that provides careers for athletes and a whole bunch of other people as a whole industry.

292
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:41,170
Speaker 1: I don't know we would need a new game to come around for that to happen.

293
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:44,846
Speaker 1: and could that game have enough staying power right?

294
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,295
Speaker 0: no game has done it and at this point.

295
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:49,022
Speaker 0: well also the final news.

296
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,350
Speaker 1: I mean some games have done it.

297
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,060
Speaker 1: you know your counter-strikes and your lols.

298
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:54,347
Speaker 1: but it's like you know and they have.

299
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:59,002
Speaker 1: the numbers on the viewers are big but you yep.

300
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,890
Speaker 0: so Blizzard also.

301
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:01,995
Speaker 0: they seem to have just given up.

302
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:04,769
Speaker 0: they laid off like their entire eSports division.

303
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,117
Speaker 1: well they've like they've keep it.

304
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:09,758
Speaker 1: see I don't know how many eSports people they have left because it's like years ago.

305
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:11,184
Speaker 1: they laid off eSports people.

306
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:15,619
Speaker 1: they did 50 more and it's like how many are left.

307
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:16,884
Speaker 1: you look at the Blizzard website.

308
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:19,397
Speaker 1: it's like they still have eSports events scheduled.

309
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:21,466
Speaker 0: how many people are left there?

310
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:30,330
Speaker 0: so an insider who did wasn't to be named in one of these articles said yeah with the few people they have left I don't know how they continue to operate any of this.

311
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:36,720
Speaker 1: it's gonna be a skeleton crew to shut down right I think that's what you're gonna see within a year or some chain.

312
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,869
Speaker 1: yeah right this they're just gonna.

313
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:39,914
Speaker 1: I stop doing.

314
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:50,682
Speaker 0: I think eSports are gonna have to come back in a very different form and I still think those the communities are strong because gaming is very popular and very important to humans.

315
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:58,208
Speaker 0: but monetizing games and gaming is not compatible with capitalism in a way that works today I think.

316
00:23:58,248 --> 00:24:11,365
Speaker 1: I think if I was if I was a game maker right and I wanted there to be a competitive scene to you know as it's as a marketing thing right it's the competitive scene only exists because I only really make money by selling the game right.

317
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:13,736
Speaker 0: so more play is clearly selling.

318
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:20,611
Speaker 1: the league is not gonna make money right and there are players who will play it for competitive reasons and I can get money from them.

319
00:24:21,114 --> 00:24:27,717
Speaker 1: so what I would do is I would just build in features in the game you know to make competitive play good right.

320
00:24:29,002 --> 00:24:48,420
Speaker 1: and then I would create you know I'd spend some a marketing budget on prizes and then I would see the players would naturally organize right their discord servers it and I would pick the well-organized players and I'd be like that tournament there his prizes official prizes for that tournament.

321
00:24:48,742 --> 00:24:58,237
Speaker 0: that's all I would do is I would just if one of those right I would just exponential back off if one of those little leagues like makes it big.

322
00:24:58,257 --> 00:25:02,920
Speaker 0: you approach them you acquire them you use that to try the other business model.

323
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:04,691
Speaker 1: you don't need to go that far I think they.

324
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:14,276
Speaker 1: just you think you they don't cost you anything to run but you just provide prizes to them as legitimacy and that brings in players and brings you know another way to go.

325
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:17,192
Speaker 1: you're gonna make all your money by selling lots of copies of that game.

326
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:23,539
Speaker 0: I think there's two other like broad ways to go that are better crazy ideas because the next way would be.

327
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:27,115
Speaker 0: people have attempted this but never really at a good scale.

328
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:36,910
Speaker 0: but the cross games Olympic style eSport run by a nonprofit that like decides what games are part of the event like the Olympics like.

329
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,504
Speaker 0: no one's really tried that effectively.

330
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:41,594
Speaker 0: I also don't know if it's basically GDQ.

331
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:42,619
Speaker 1: we already have GDQ.

332
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:42,941
Speaker 1: it exists.

333
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:48,365
Speaker 0: it's like except you know you make it more you know like structured kind of like the Olympics.

334
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:52,821
Speaker 0: hmm the way that I think could make the most I don't know.

335
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:53,888
Speaker 1: if the cult you know I don't know.

336
00:25:53,909 --> 00:26:02,586
Speaker 1: if there's enough people who have the culture of caring about who wins you know - well the thing is that's where the year I think you're raising point.

337
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:08,342
Speaker 0: that's where the Olympics a big chunk of the audience are people who have nationalist or personal reasons to care who wins.

338
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:15,618
Speaker 0: but like when I watch the Olympics there's a subset of people I just want to see these exhibitions of skill like I want to see the human.

339
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,388
Speaker 1: that's but that's that's what GDQ does.

340
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:19,459
Speaker 1: they just think so there you go the end.

341
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,790
Speaker 1: they don't need the competition part and they don't have it and the competition could in a way be strong as strong as ever.

342
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:32,058
Speaker 0: yeah the third way to go the way that I think would be the coolest and I would love to see someone try it.

343
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,227
Speaker 0: I don't have enough money to do it or I would try it.

344
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:42,094
Speaker 0: you got to combine in equal parts the Harlem Globetrotters the WWE and eSports.

345
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:46,329
Speaker 1: in some WWE part is definitely the part that's missing right.

346
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:47,152
Speaker 0: I want to see the.

347
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:54,320
Speaker 0: I want to see the GDQ person exhibiting the extreme skill in the same way that a WWE wrestler is exhibiting.

348
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:56,669
Speaker 1: extreme of them do a few but yeah not.

349
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:59,963
Speaker 0: but I want to see that coupled with the narrative.

350
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:01,511
Speaker 0: it's not really a fair competition.

351
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:06,437
Speaker 0: you are setting up the experience to be amazing like you're setting up the eSports.

352
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:17,707
Speaker 0: have the crazy thing happen and then you mix in the Harlem Globetrotters like someone pulls off the glitch in the middle of the match and you'd like you make it enter script semi scripted entertainment.

353
00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:23,654
Speaker 0: that involves exhibitions of skill but I do not have the money or the connections to push that.

354
00:27:23,714 --> 00:27:25,343
Speaker 0: nor do I have the energy to try to push that.

355
00:27:25,784 --> 00:27:34,464
Speaker 0: somebody's gonna do it someday and I'd say there's a 15 or 20 percent chance they make a lot of money and an a 75 to 80 percent chance they lose everything.

356
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:36,820
Speaker 1: it's and I think it's just hard to do that in a video game.

357
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:38,974
Speaker 0: well that's where you got to cross things a little bit.

358
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:41,062
Speaker 0: you got to be clever I don't know.

359
00:27:41,122 --> 00:27:45,596
Speaker 0: maybe it's like chess boxing biathlon.

360
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,816
Speaker 0: you're playing airsoft and overwatch or airsoft and counter-strike.

361
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:50,539
Speaker 0: you got to do both.

362
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,580
Speaker 1: you need to devise some special game that like someone's controlling behind this.

363
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,264
Speaker 1: yeah that's right.

364
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,502
Speaker 1: or just pre record the game and two people sit there with controllers.

365
00:27:58,603 --> 00:28:03,486
Speaker 1: however you do is two actors yet two actors pretend to push buttons while the video plays.

366
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:07,645
Speaker 0: you script it to the level that the WWE is scripted like you go all out on.

367
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:09,072
Speaker 0: the entertainment is the goal.

368
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:13,298
Speaker 1: competition is the fiction right but I'm saying is that there is some improv element to the.

369
00:28:13,418 --> 00:28:18,667
Speaker 1: you know professional wrestling that you can't have with a video game because the video game itself is rigid.

370
00:28:18,807 --> 00:28:31,805
Speaker 0: unless those people with such high skill imagine if two of the best a GDQ runners who both know one game really well we're doing a fake competition where they are working with each other to make interesting things happen on purpose.

371
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:34,259
Speaker 1: it's like yes they might but it's like if it's live.

372
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:37,680
Speaker 1: then it's like even those people are not perfect because it's so difficult right.

373
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,890
Speaker 0: so well it might not have to be perfect.

374
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:40,353
Speaker 0: I mean the.

375
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:46,322
Speaker 1: the kayfabe survives despite wrestling being hyper telegraph because you're just a human being and you can fudge it.

376
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:52,470
Speaker 1: the ref can be like you know count slowly or you know you can wait before you slam somebody right.

377
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,896
Speaker 1: it's like in Street Fighter.

378
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:58,074
Speaker 1: it's like the timer is ticking but the health meter is there right.

379
00:28:58,115 --> 00:28:58,717
Speaker 0: maybe you know.

380
00:28:58,878 --> 00:28:59,862
Speaker 0: open-ended fortnight.

381
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:04,782
Speaker 0: in the event where you know the things coming in you have an agreement.

382
00:29:04,822 --> 00:29:06,107
Speaker 0: look this person's gonna win.

383
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:11,449
Speaker 1: don't kill them that's yep sure but it's like you know things can happen.

384
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:12,877
Speaker 0: I mean things can't like a WWE.

385
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:20,191
Speaker 0: sometimes the wrong person wins because whatever was failed and they have to do a backup plan and they like have to do some shenanigans.

386
00:29:20,231 --> 00:29:22,023
Speaker 0: last minute I just watched it's.

387
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:22,847
Speaker 1: that's pretty rare.

388
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:30,322
Speaker 0: it's pretty rare but I watched a documentary recently about this old ladder match for like someone fell off the ladder and they changed.

389
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:35,074
Speaker 0: who won like a mid-match to make it work anyway?

390
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:35,635
Speaker 0: anyway?

391
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:38,242
Speaker 0: got any news that should we get into?

392
00:29:38,262 --> 00:29:39,847
Speaker 1: and we talked too long.

393
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:45,443
Speaker 1: sports is a doing poorly things of the day.

394
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:48,536
Speaker 0: so I work with a lot of German engineers.

395
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:49,902
Speaker 0: I spent a lot of time in Germany.

396
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,856
Speaker 0: I did my current job and I've always enjoyed Germany.

397
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:58,497
Speaker 0: but this YouTube channel Kelvin and Habs is great because it's basically.

398
00:29:58,557 --> 00:30:15,639
Speaker 0: the conceit is you've got an American and a German and they explain the less well-known cultural or societal concepts in their respective cultures to each other under the auspices of their roommates like hey I moved to Germany I'm an American.

399
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:16,824
Speaker 0: well what do I need to know?

400
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:18,613
Speaker 0: or I'm German I'm living in America.

401
00:30:18,915 --> 00:30:21,067
Speaker 0: what the fuck is AC and why do you have it like?

402
00:30:21,108 --> 00:30:26,775
Speaker 0: it's funny but it's kind of talking about the things you wouldn't know unless you moved to Germany.

403
00:30:26,836 --> 00:30:33,855
Speaker 0: let's say and then we're confused by the culture and had to realize that if you rent an apartment the kitchen doesn't come with any appliances like.

404
00:30:33,895 --> 00:30:37,033
Speaker 0: that's just not a thing in Germany like bring your own appliances.

405
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:40,791
Speaker 1: and if that sounds like I'd like to bring my own appliances yeah that would be nice.

406
00:30:40,911 --> 00:30:48,139
Speaker 0: yeah yeah but how the fuck would you have even thought about that until you're like talking to an agent over there like hopefully you're like hey I'm dumb American.

407
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:48,963
Speaker 0: is there anything I'm missing?

408
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:54,124
Speaker 0: but this one is a good one because it's about the Schreiber gardens.

409
00:30:55,468 --> 00:31:10,453
Speaker 0: there's a lot of unspoken cultural norms in Germany that I transgress upon accidentally constantly and my teams are very good at like politely pointing out like oh yeah that's not how it works here but the Schreiber gardens are really fun concepts.

410
00:31:10,474 --> 00:31:11,119
Speaker 0: that's my thing of the day.

411
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:12,163
Speaker 0: it's a 60-second video.

412
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:23,686
Speaker 0: this will explain to you what a Schreiber garden is and how that's different from a regular gotten and why you are not allowed to fucking talk in Schreiber gardens.

413
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:26,500
Speaker 1: you sit there and quiet is three but just mean quiet.

414
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,608
Speaker 0: basically they're private gardens.

415
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:33,509
Speaker 0: so imagine in New York okay you got Central Park Bryant Park all these meds.

416
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,353
Speaker 0: they're public.

417
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:37,386
Speaker 0: people can kind of do their private their private one.

418
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:40,463
Speaker 0: oh yeah but in the public parks people can kind of do whatever they want.

419
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:41,849
Speaker 0: like people tend to be loud.

420
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,522
Speaker 1: rules yeah but yeah people are loud.

421
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:47,975
Speaker 0: there are not a lot of social conventions in these parks.

422
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:56,898
Speaker 0: but like you can't play ball games in Bryant Park but you can play ball games in certain parts of Central Park for example the private gardens these Schreiber gardens.

423
00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:01,156
Speaker 0: they're like the private gardens in New York except the people who share them.

424
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:09,647
Speaker 0: they tend to be used in a very particular way and this video does a very good job of explaining this particular German concepts.

425
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,839
Speaker 0: so what do you got?

426
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:18,643
Speaker 1: so here's this website that I guess who knows how old this website is and I just never came across.

427
00:32:18,684 --> 00:32:22,098
Speaker 0: it looks well it looks old but that is definitely on purpose.

428
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,066
Speaker 1: yeah it's a chiptune dot app.

429
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:30,631
Speaker 1: it looks like a DOS command-line GUI with the blue background from some old IBM ps1 or something.

430
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:44,015
Speaker 1: but it's it's all JavaScript and you just click on search or browse and they have over 200,000 chiptunes to listen to from all the old video games just right there.

431
00:32:44,155 --> 00:33:04,390
Speaker 1: so if there's some like video game ost from I don't know some old Famicom or sharp X 68,000 MDX or this folder called jazz MIDI oh wow it's more than just like what I was thinking about in chiptunes.

432
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:11,643
Speaker 1: I gotta poke around in this more because under that meeting directory that whatever whatever foul browsh v2 is I could Google and find out but so can you.

433
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:15,860
Speaker 0: this looks a lot like the stuff that was on Vikram's in the day.

434
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:23,880
Speaker 1: there's 200,000 plus audio files to listen to of chiptune enjoyment just in a little JavaScript player in your web browser for free with no ads all right.

435
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,907
Speaker 0: so like I got to make a cocktail and spend an evening poking around in here yeah the fine.

436
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:35,037
Speaker 1: find some buried treasures in there and then there's a favorites tab where you can save your favorites to go back to them quickly.

437
00:33:35,298 --> 00:33:37,751
Speaker 0: if the Vikram stuff is in here died this will.

438
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:44,223
Speaker 0: this means I don't have to try to get the data off of the one hard drive I ever had that died and it looks like it is based on my memory.

439
00:33:46,268 --> 00:33:50,179
Speaker 0: anyway I'm at a moment the geek nights book club book.

440
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:53,634
Speaker 0: I gotta reopen the geek nights website cuz I closed the tab.

441
00:33:53,695 --> 00:34:00,158
Speaker 0: it is this is how you lose the time war by Amal El-Mothar and Max Gladstone.

442
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:02,164
Speaker 0: we should be doing this show on Thursday.

443
00:34:02,285 --> 00:34:03,549
Speaker 0: it is a very short book.

444
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:08,485
Speaker 0: you have not read it by tonight and you're listening to geek nights.

445
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:10,576
Speaker 0: I think you could read this book in.

446
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,420
Speaker 1: you got time.

447
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,128
Speaker 0: two to three hours tops.

448
00:34:13,188 --> 00:34:17,025
Speaker 1: like you'll you'll make it in time for the Thursday two nights from now.

449
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:22,887
Speaker 0: it's a quick read and I got some things to say about it mm-hmm and I'll leave it at that.

450
00:34:23,088 --> 00:34:27,047
Speaker 0: but yeah then I guess we're gonna have to pick the next book club book.

451
00:34:27,087 --> 00:34:28,775
Speaker 0: it's gonna be on me to do a choice again.

452
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:33,335
Speaker 0: do I bring back Uber to echo and I gotta figure out what I'm gonna make the choices?

453
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:34,641
Speaker 1: yeah you could.

454
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:37,400
Speaker 1: you could just keep bringing back the same one and only you know.

455
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,018
Speaker 1: loser or winner walks loser keeps trying again like the Omega thon or whatever trying to figure out what my personal rules are gonna be for that.

456
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:49,487
Speaker 0: like if I bring a book more than n times and it doesn't get picked I feel like that is a sign from the heavens.

457
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:53,504
Speaker 1: I just decided that you know what I'm gonna always come with some.

458
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:55,876
Speaker 1: I'm not just gonna have two things that are random.

459
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:57,263
Speaker 1: right I got to make it interesting.

460
00:34:57,323 --> 00:34:58,951
Speaker 1: I'll just have some sort of logic.

461
00:34:59,393 --> 00:35:07,127
Speaker 0: oh whatever the logic is I picked two books that were famous that neither of us had read that were published in the same year.

462
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:07,970
Speaker 0: last time.

463
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:12,532
Speaker 1: I just as long as I have some sort of logic to keep it interesting yeah and that's fine.

464
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:13,416
Speaker 1: who cares right?

465
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:16,814
Speaker 1: because if I try to make something more rigid it'll just be difficult.

466
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:18,342
Speaker 0: yeah this is supposed to be fun.

467
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,427
Speaker 0: the whole point is that it's fun.

468
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:24,409
Speaker 0: otherwise we will be at PAX West doing a panel on games you can't play.

469
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:29,909
Speaker 0: we will pretty definitely be at PAX unplugged doing some amount of content.

470
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:34,024
Speaker 0: PAX unplugged is still my favorite PAX so stay tuned for that.

471
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:34,848
Speaker 0: we'll definitely be there.

472
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:41,933
Speaker 0: I do have a hotel room for magfest and uh I guess I can share this.

473
00:35:41,953 --> 00:35:43,639
Speaker 1: I don't know about magfest.

474
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:46,326
Speaker 0: I'm going 100% absolutely going to magfest.

475
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,618
Speaker 0: but I talked to the people who run mages.

476
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,333
Speaker 0: they it was running in a limited form during the COVID times.

477
00:35:54,896 --> 00:36:01,279
Speaker 0: it is coming back in full glory and we are invited to return to its full and former glory.

478
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:03,232
Speaker 1: are the people running it different people than before?

479
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:10,184
Speaker 0: there seemed to be a lot of different people involved in the email list that I am now on again but seems a little more streamlined.

480
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:11,630
Speaker 0: uh I don't know.

481
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:16,430
Speaker 0: I think I think the people we enjoyed doing panels with all appear to still be around.

482
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:17,274
Speaker 0: I can say that.

483
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:18,298
Speaker 1: well we'll see.

484
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,007
Speaker 0: so I will be at magfest.

485
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:22,120
Speaker 0: if Scott decides not to go it's just gonna be for him.

486
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:28,063
Speaker 0: I'd like six or seven panels but I think I'm gonna even though I have a room in the Wyndham.

487
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:32,928
Speaker 0: if I can get a Gaylord room I think I just want to stay in the Gaylord if I'm going back to a magfest.

488
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:37,832
Speaker 0: I'm spending a lot of time hanging out with randos in the con and less they sold out.

489
00:36:37,852 --> 00:36:38,013
Speaker 1: yet.

490
00:36:38,414 --> 00:36:39,660
Speaker 0: hmm they're not available.

491
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,403
Speaker 0: remember the lottery.

492
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,576
Speaker 0: you've never done the lottery have you?

493
00:36:43,837 --> 00:36:44,420
Speaker 0: you can't know.

494
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:44,963
Speaker 1: because yeah.

495
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:47,054
Speaker 0: so guess what you can't book a Lord rooms.

496
00:36:47,336 --> 00:36:52,403
Speaker 0: the way Gaylord rooms work is if you buy a magfest badge then you can get into the Gaylord room lottery.

497
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:53,088
Speaker 1: oh but how could I?

498
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:54,901
Speaker 1: I'm not buying a badge though I'm getting a free one.

499
00:36:55,243 --> 00:37:05,865
Speaker 0: uh yes so if you're getting a free badge then the only way to get a Gaylord room is shenanigans or talking to mages and joining me rejoining mages in some capacity.

500
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:10,288
Speaker 1: well can I can I like you know try to get try to play the lottery and then just not go?

501
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:13,183
Speaker 0: if I lose the lottery I think you'd have to buy a badge to do that.

502
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:15,492
Speaker 0: I'm gonna find out.

503
00:37:15,753 --> 00:37:18,825
Speaker 0: but regardless I did book a Wyndham suite just for me and Emily.

504
00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:22,442
Speaker 0: that has a bedroom in it so theoretically we could put more people in it.

505
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:24,348
Speaker 0: we'll see we'll see.

506
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,416
Speaker 0: I'm uh I miss magfest.

507
00:37:26,456 --> 00:37:27,540
Speaker 0: I miss magfest a lot.

508
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,787
Speaker 1: look at the look at the calendar.

509
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:30,457
Speaker 0: you know it's not over New Year's.

510
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:31,765
Speaker 0: it's like way later than usual.

511
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:33,274
Speaker 1: yeah they made it later this year.

512
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,728
Speaker 0: yeah which kind of makes it better for me timing wise.

513
00:37:35,788 --> 00:37:38,482
Speaker 0: I kind of want to do New Year's like more like old times.

514
00:37:38,543 --> 00:37:41,942
Speaker 0: I don't really want to do New Year's magfest but anyway that was the meta moment.

515
00:37:41,962 --> 00:37:42,806
Speaker 0: we've talked for a long time.

516
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:55,853
Speaker 0: we were going to review not one two games tonight because they are games that are really good but with some caveats and there's not that much to say about right.

517
00:37:56,916 --> 00:38:00,413
Speaker 0: but it is a sign that we will be doing a lot more board game reviews in the future.

518
00:38:00,453 --> 00:38:08,371
Speaker 0: because uh while we were on vacation I think we played like seven board games that all are worthy of a review at least.

519
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:10,340
Speaker 1: maybe played seven games we haven't played before.

520
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,601
Speaker 1: it does.

521
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:12,148
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter how worthy they are.

522
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:19,282
Speaker 1: but anyway there was a person named Sid Saxon right who is the person who designed the game acquire which you may have heard of.

523
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:23,178
Speaker 1: he was a famous legendary figure in the gaming world.

524
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:35,036
Speaker 1: I think we mentioned him on geek nights when his massive lifelong game collection was broken up and sold thousands individual games in this collection.

525
00:38:35,056 --> 00:38:40,617
Speaker 1: yeah and all of his papers collected were put into the strong museum.

526
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:40,858
Speaker 1: right.

527
00:38:40,878 --> 00:38:47,946
Speaker 1: so if you have your papers put in a museum you know that you are a significant figure in whatever field your field is.

528
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:48,971
Speaker 1: his field was games.

529
00:38:49,011 --> 00:38:51,903
Speaker 1: this is the guy Sid Saxon was like his old dude.

530
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:54,855
Speaker 1: he was just all in on games his whole life right.

531
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:58,207
Speaker 1: he would write books about games and you know he was born in 1920.

532
00:38:58,207 --> 00:39:17,840
Speaker 0: his most famous game is probably acquire that was published in 1964. so he was older than us when he published his first like super notable game like the one that if you didn't know acquire was from the 60s and we just got a modern copy of it and brought it to the table.

533
00:39:18,362 --> 00:39:23,142
Speaker 0: you would probably assume it was made more recently than 1964. it's a solid game.

534
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:26,253
Speaker 1: yeah I mean it's not perfect but you know.

535
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:28,000
Speaker 1: but you know this was alleged.

536
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,980
Speaker 1: you know and I think you know his biggest works actually were his books.

537
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:36,892
Speaker 1: right if you buy one of the Sid Saxon books it's like it's just page after page and like every couple pages has another game.

538
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:37,877
Speaker 1: they're all games.

539
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:41,056
Speaker 1: most of them are just using like standard pieces like you know.

540
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:42,787
Speaker 1: here's another game you can play with a deck of cards.

541
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,640
Speaker 1: here's a game you can play with a bunch of dice.

542
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:49,481
Speaker 1: it's just like you you buy one book and you get like a hundred fucking games in there.

543
00:39:49,582 --> 00:39:51,831
Speaker 1: right it's like you know this guy.

544
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:57,797
Speaker 1: really he compiled you know all the gaming knowledge there was and that's why it's in a museum yep.

545
00:39:57,817 --> 00:40:09,664
Speaker 1: but anyway we played two of his games that we had not played previously even though the first of which is like a game that like everyone's played and that game is can't stop which I had.

546
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:15,023
Speaker 0: actually while I was aware of it I had never played it until right I had.

547
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:16,993
Speaker 1: I knew of it for many many years.

548
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:17,817
Speaker 1: I just hadn't played it.

549
00:40:18,098 --> 00:40:28,191
Speaker 1: actually for reals by I knew how to play it and basically can't stop is almost the purest form of push your luck game.

550
00:40:28,432 --> 00:40:28,814
Speaker 1: there is.

551
00:40:28,854 --> 00:40:29,497
Speaker 1: that's all there is to

552
00:40:29,517 --> 00:40:30,742
Speaker 0: its first push your luck

553
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:47,732
Speaker 1: yeah and the thing about can't stop that separates it for I think from the other push your luck games is that an other push your luck games there is like this steady sort of reduction of the odds right when you can feel yourself getting squeezed and you're like.

554
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:48,597
Speaker 1: you're like okay.

555
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:50,629
Speaker 1: I got like a hundred percent chance to still be in.

556
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:52,741
Speaker 1: I got a ninety percent chance to still be in.

557
00:40:53,103 --> 00:40:54,589
Speaker 1: I got a fifty percent chance.

558
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:55,514
Speaker 1: I'll still be in.

559
00:40:55,976 --> 00:40:57,985
Speaker 1: all right I got a less than I'm out right.

560
00:40:58,065 --> 00:40:59,271
Speaker 1: it's like you can feel it.

561
00:40:59,412 --> 00:41:07,032
Speaker 1: the squeeze coming on and back out and the only time you don't back out when the squeeze comes on is when you're way behind and you sort of have to go for the onsides.

562
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:08,739
Speaker 1: kick yeah and right.

563
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:14,234
Speaker 1: and now that same thing still holds true and can't stop but in can't stop.

564
00:41:15,217 --> 00:41:19,730
Speaker 1: the odds never really squeeze you so tightly.

565
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,314
Speaker 0: oh it is notable.

566
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:35,824
Speaker 0: both me and Scott despite being I would say very good at statistical heuristics in games like this we pushed our luck to failure way more often than anyone would expect either of us to.

567
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:37,550
Speaker 0: but it felt.

568
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:42,990
Speaker 0: but I felt good about those decisions which means this game has got something going on right.

569
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:49,536
Speaker 1: it's like it never squeezes you so tightly numbers wise that you feel like you're gonna be.

570
00:41:49,577 --> 00:41:50,300
Speaker 1: you're gonna lose.

571
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,827
Speaker 1: you have to stop now right.

572
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:54,822
Speaker 1: and the way the way it works is you're all about 46 right?

573
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:55,083
Speaker 0: yeah?

574
00:41:55,123 --> 00:42:03,190
Speaker 1: a small number of dice yeah 40 46 and you can combine them any which way into two sets of two dice each right.

575
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:11,301
Speaker 1: so if you're rolling 46 it's like you know what are the odds like a seven is gonna be in there somewhere among two dice.

576
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,253
Speaker 1: really it feels yeah I've never done the math.

577
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:16,421
Speaker 1: that feels like you can't miss.

578
00:42:17,183 --> 00:42:20,332
Speaker 0: it feels like that craps tables.

579
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:22,738
Speaker 1: of course it's like but you know what?

580
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,410
Speaker 1: what are the odds of four ones coming up?

581
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:26,415
Speaker 1: it could happen.

582
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:28,245
Speaker 1: what are the odds of four sixes coming up?

583
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,712
Speaker 1: it can happen right.

584
00:42:29,752 --> 00:42:30,858
Speaker 1: it's like you're not gonna get.

585
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:31,180
Speaker 1: it's not.

586
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:32,566
Speaker 1: nothing is guaranteed.

587
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:37,467
Speaker 0: but to make it even better it's not too independent 2d sixes it's 4d six.

588
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:45,381
Speaker 0: because the next step of the game is you look at the four numbers you rolled and you arrange them into an arbitrary combination of two to six.

589
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:47,448
Speaker 1: yeah it's any which way right.

590
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:56,968
Speaker 1: so you're like you feel like even when you know you need a particular you just need like to hit one of the numbers right of that are possible between two and twelve.

591
00:42:57,511 --> 00:43:01,408
Speaker 1: it's like yes I just need to hit one of these numbers between two and twelve.

592
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:06,292
Speaker 1: it's just like you're rolling for d6 and feel you never feel like I'm gonna.

593
00:43:06,392 --> 00:43:07,418
Speaker 1: there's no way I'm gonna get.

594
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:11,014
Speaker 1: and I think that feels like yeah my chances are good I'm going for it.

595
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:11,295
Speaker 1: I've got.

596
00:43:11,436 --> 00:43:13,083
Speaker 1: you can't stop right?

597
00:43:13,284 --> 00:43:15,534
Speaker 1: you had to you feel like you're gonna make it.

598
00:43:15,574 --> 00:43:18,106
Speaker 1: you keep rolling and then you miss and then you're fine.

599
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:20,660
Speaker 0: and I feel like that is the brilliant of this game.

600
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:29,854
Speaker 0: we didn't get into the specific mechanics but the brilliance is you are more likely to be fine than get fucked most of the time.

601
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:36,453
Speaker 0: but what that causes is this letter ride feeling where I got an 80% chance that's fine.

602
00:43:36,453 --> 00:43:38,702
Speaker 0: 80% chance that's fine.

603
00:43:39,023 --> 00:43:41,775
Speaker 1: and yeah yeah 80% chance is fine as long as you.

604
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:41,976
Speaker 1: what?

605
00:43:42,157 --> 00:43:46,717
Speaker 1: as soon as you try eight times yeah like that's all you're gonna miss one of those times.

606
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:48,845
Speaker 1: I can you really it's like it's gonna.

607
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:54,509
Speaker 1: you know even if you only try five times like okay one of them is gonna miss.

608
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:55,596
Speaker 1: yep you've already tried.

609
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:56,642
Speaker 1: you already got four in a row.

610
00:43:56,683 --> 00:43:58,574
Speaker 1: you really want to try the fifth time on the 80% chance.

611
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:03,243
Speaker 0: so mechanically like the specifics the way this works is you've got this big pattern I got.

612
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:07,268
Speaker 0: if you're on the live stream I got a board up you can look at but basically it's just a.

613
00:44:07,389 --> 00:44:08,133
Speaker 1: it's just a racetrack.

614
00:44:08,153 --> 00:44:12,676
Speaker 0: yep just a racetrack but there's a. it's a square but you're approaching it diagonally.

615
00:44:12,756 --> 00:44:17,136
Speaker 0: so you're trying to get all your good all your pips all the way to the end.

616
00:44:17,296 --> 00:44:24,305
Speaker 0: so if I roll two sevens I can move a pip up to on the seven track the seven tracks in the center corner to corner.

617
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:28,181
Speaker 0: it's the longest path but so I gotta get one easy to get.

618
00:44:28,242 --> 00:44:30,309
Speaker 1: numbers are of a long path right.

619
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:36,214
Speaker 0: so I gotta roll 13 sevens without stopping or stopping at an appropriate point.

620
00:44:36,254 --> 00:44:36,918
Speaker 0: but you can't stop.

621
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,924
Speaker 0: you got to keep going fuck you.

622
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:40,688
Speaker 0: or at the very edges.

623
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:46,345
Speaker 0: if I just roll two three times I get to the end of the two track.

624
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:49,962
Speaker 1: and if right now it's like two is pretty hard you need to get two ones.

625
00:44:50,043 --> 00:44:50,966
Speaker 1: but it's like two ones.

626
00:44:51,207 --> 00:44:56,708
Speaker 0: on 4d6 it's like hmm yeah it's a it's a. hmm it's not a like.

627
00:44:56,768 --> 00:44:58,638
Speaker 0: calculate the strict odds in your head situation.

628
00:44:58,658 --> 00:44:59,301
Speaker 0: you look at that.

629
00:44:59,342 --> 00:45:00,568
Speaker 1: you know it was 2d6.

630
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:01,333
Speaker 1: you'd be like hell.

631
00:45:01,373 --> 00:45:01,996
Speaker 1: no I get it.

632
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:04,146
Speaker 1: what are the odds of me rolling snake eyes too low.

633
00:45:04,146 --> 00:45:05,171
Speaker 1: 46 it's like.

634
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,360
Speaker 1: I'll eventually make it three times.

635
00:45:07,962 --> 00:45:12,722
Speaker 0: feels good to like advance advance that if it comes up because that's a nice safety yeah.

636
00:45:13,565 --> 00:45:21,497
Speaker 0: but so even if you got something on seven you got to keep rolling seven once you've got all your pips moving on the board.

637
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:22,803
Speaker 1: right you have three pips.

638
00:45:22,984 --> 00:45:35,646
Speaker 1: so you eventually assign your pips to three different numbers on the board and once they're all out there right if they're not out there yet you can sort of assign them to any number that you've rolled and put together from 2d6 out of your four.

639
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:41,147
Speaker 1: but once all three of your pips are out there let's say I got it on seven eight and ten.

640
00:45:41,228 --> 00:45:45,079
Speaker 1: yeah right I roll my 46 among the four dice.

641
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:52,386
Speaker 1: I have to put together at least one seven or one eight or one ten and advance one of my pips at least one space.

642
00:45:52,446 --> 00:45:58,851
Speaker 1: if I can't with any combination of the dice make a seven and eight or a ten and I can't move any of my pips.

643
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:02,947
Speaker 1: I busted yeah and all my pips got to go back.

644
00:46:02,987 --> 00:46:06,100
Speaker 1: yup but where they started before I started my turn.

645
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,903
Speaker 0: but that's the key.

646
00:46:07,144 --> 00:46:14,133
Speaker 1: if you stop but you don't want to if you have the guts to stop then they lot that it's like a save point.

647
00:46:14,193 --> 00:46:19,800
Speaker 1: they can't there wherever they are they they're set and they can't be pushed any further back and you can make.

648
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:27,277
Speaker 0: I gotta tell ya locking in a good run is really really really powerful.

649
00:46:27,658 --> 00:46:34,263
Speaker 0: but even me and Scott you look at it you've rolled 11 times in a row when things are going great.

650
00:46:34,303 --> 00:46:35,589
Speaker 0: you got something on seven.

651
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:36,473
Speaker 0: so you know you're safe.

652
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,080
Speaker 0: you just look at it.

653
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:39,469
Speaker 1: how can I not get a seven?

654
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:41,842
Speaker 1: I'll just keep going till I win the whole seven track.

655
00:46:41,962 --> 00:46:47,865
Speaker 0: yeah good I think I busted back to zero like four times in a row and I consider myself a smart person.

656
00:46:50,091 --> 00:47:00,132
Speaker 1: so I think I think that this is a model that some other push your luck games should try is don't squeeze you know keep all the rest of your game is just fine.

657
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:01,844
Speaker 1: there's a lot of good push your luck games out there.

658
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:03,353
Speaker 1: like you we play it we like to play.

659
00:47:03,394 --> 00:47:05,986
Speaker 1: no thanks right I'll put the tokens on the card right.

660
00:47:06,006 --> 00:47:06,468
Speaker 1: that games all.

661
00:47:06,508 --> 00:47:10,687
Speaker 1: eventually the card has so many tokens on it you're like.

662
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:12,799
Speaker 1: of course I'm just gonna take the card right.

663
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:26,413
Speaker 1: but imagine if no thanks like never squeezed hard enough and it's like you just always like didn't want to take the card even when there was a mountain of to you know and you just kept pushing it.

664
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:27,998
Speaker 1: I don't know it'll be more.

665
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:28,781
Speaker 0: that's it the game.

666
00:47:28,821 --> 00:47:30,771
Speaker 0: so simple like poking around a board game.

667
00:47:30,812 --> 00:47:34,550
Speaker 0: geek people just make this game by drawing it or printing it out of.

668
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,125
Speaker 1: yeah all you need is for all you need is 4d6 and a piece of paper.

669
00:47:38,145 --> 00:47:43,747
Speaker 0: yep right and some and some some number of objects to put on this piece of paper.

670
00:47:43,867 --> 00:47:45,919
Speaker 1: you really yeah I mean that guys it you know it.

671
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,492
Speaker 1: but what's the rating on board game geek?

672
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,321
Speaker 0: I think let me let's go back to can't stop.

673
00:47:50,341 --> 00:47:51,369
Speaker 1: oh it's low people don't.

674
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:53,121
Speaker 1: people don't like wouldn't like this game this game.

675
00:47:53,342 --> 00:47:57,840
Speaker 1: you talk about fun economy this I get board game geek gives can't stop.

676
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,028
Speaker 1: from 1980 a six point nine.

677
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,115
Speaker 1: I give it like a nine.

678
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:16,845
Speaker 0: I was gonna say nine as well because this game unless you're playing with an intolerable spiders your type person this game takes maybe 15 minutes to play and it feels real good the entire time.

679
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:20,577
Speaker 0: yeah like this game is so fun for how simple it is.

680
00:48:20,959 --> 00:48:23,306
Speaker 0: it takes so little time to teach this game.

681
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:27,118
Speaker 0: yeah so yeah play this game.

682
00:48:27,158 --> 00:48:28,483
Speaker 0: there's no reason not to play this game.

683
00:48:28,524 --> 00:48:33,364
Speaker 0: it would be an a-plus Omega thon game at PAX unplugged like S here.

684
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:34,468
Speaker 1: oh yeah.

685
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:43,591
Speaker 1: so the next game was one that's from one of his books that I went and I found an excerpt from on the Internet Archive and then transcribed and then prepared all the pieces for it.

686
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:55,844
Speaker 1: all it needed was a deck of cards in a stack of chips and the and it's game is called all my diamonds and it's a very modern art adjacent selling auctioning game bidding game right which of course we love right.

687
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:59,143
Speaker 1: and the way it works is you get a deck of cards and you throw the tens out.

688
00:48:59,163 --> 00:49:00,267
Speaker 1: you get the tens out of there.

689
00:49:00,288 --> 00:49:09,417
Speaker 1: so you got 48 cards and if you got those 48 cards with no tens there are basically eight sets of 12.

690
00:49:09,417 --> 00:49:13,012
Speaker 0: you got a matrix of the suits and exactly.

691
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:15,324
Speaker 1: so there's the diamonds the hearts the clubs in the spades.

692
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:17,456
Speaker 1: those are 12 cards each as the tens are out.

693
00:49:17,939 --> 00:49:30,623
Speaker 1: and then there's the lows the aces twos and threes the the mids the fours fives and sixes the highs the sevens eights and nines and then the faces the Jack Queen Kings right.

694
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:52,907
Speaker 1: and so therefore you've got eight sets of 12 and your goal of the game is to in your hand have 10 cards that are all in the same set of 12. so 10 clubs 10 diamonds 10 lows 10 faces right and as soon as you get 10 of one of the sets you put it out there.

695
00:49:52,927 --> 00:49:58,205
Speaker 1: you're like boom and you collect the pot right of chips that have everyone anteed.

696
00:49:58,225 --> 00:50:04,022
Speaker 1: it is a big ante and so then you continue playing.

697
00:50:04,424 --> 00:50:12,066
Speaker 1: everyone continues playing and there's a second pot and the second pot is comprised of taxes.

698
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:27,656
Speaker 1: because the way you acquire cards is that on your turn you must look at your hand and pick one of the eight sets and take all the cards that you have in that set at least one card also.

699
00:50:27,716 --> 00:50:33,254
Speaker 1: you can't just pick a set you don't have and sell it to everyone else right?

700
00:50:33,454 --> 00:50:36,043
Speaker 1: so you might say all my diamonds right.

701
00:50:36,123 --> 00:50:40,102
Speaker 1: I'll take all the diamonds out of your hand and sell them as a lot at auction.

702
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:42,272
Speaker 1: or you might say all my faces.

703
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:46,467
Speaker 1: and you take all the face cards out of your whole hand and sell them at auction.

704
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:56,338
Speaker 1: and you get right all the money when you sell the cards except one cards worth of money is paid in taxes.

705
00:50:56,358 --> 00:51:01,354
Speaker 1: so if you sell five cards you keep 80% of the money right.

706
00:51:01,455 --> 00:51:03,982
Speaker 1: if you sell two cards you keep half the money.

707
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:07,673
Speaker 1: if you sell ten cards you keep 90% of the money right.

708
00:51:08,054 --> 00:51:12,653
Speaker 1: so and the rest of the money you don't keep goes to the second pot.

709
00:51:13,015 --> 00:51:18,966
Speaker 1: that will be for the winner of you know the second winner basically and it could be the same person who wins both times.

710
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:24,087
Speaker 1: right now the thing with this game is that all that matters is who has the most money wins.

711
00:51:24,589 --> 00:51:29,025
Speaker 1: so you could actually not win either pot and just sell.

712
00:51:29,126 --> 00:51:39,444
Speaker 1: be so good at selling and we're buying low and selling high that you end up making more money by being a card seller right then by being a winner and that's the thing.

713
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:42,413
Speaker 1: so that's the whole.

714
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,074
Speaker 1: that's the whole game.

715
00:51:43,235 --> 00:51:47,868
Speaker 0: this game is worth playing to explore the concept.

716
00:51:47,968 --> 00:52:03,680
Speaker 0: but we devolved into a giggling fit in our game because this game when confronted by what I would say is a group of stone cold pros who have very good understandings of bidding and valuation.

717
00:52:04,442 --> 00:52:09,578
Speaker 0: the bidding breaks down into a disaster and the game falls apart.

718
00:52:09,758 --> 00:52:13,369
Speaker 0: and it was to watch the game just like collapse around us.

719
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:20,057
Speaker 1: right so Sid Saxon says all my diamonds is a game I conceived as a change of pace from poker.

720
00:52:20,198 --> 00:52:25,080
Speaker 1: although there is no similarity in the play it satisfies the same urge for speculation.

721
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:31,085
Speaker 1: it's basically an auction where players must decide whether they can earn more by buying or by selling.

722
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:42,111
Speaker 1: right but yeah when we played it it's like you could sort of imagine worlds where like other lines of play might have been possible there's obviously some luck element.

723
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:44,723
Speaker 1: you could just be dealt some amazing hands something right.

724
00:52:45,104 --> 00:52:53,068
Speaker 1: but the the initial pot is just so much bigger than anyone who's willing to bid for anything.

725
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:55,439
Speaker 1: and it's like you think well a bit more.

726
00:52:55,499 --> 00:52:55,860
Speaker 1: but it's like.

727
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:02,169
Speaker 0: but if you bid more like your winnings are so capped by the nature of the game that it won't work out for you.

728
00:53:02,992 --> 00:53:10,576
Speaker 1: so yeah it's like if I'm gonna wait if we got four players right and everyone puts in you know 15 anti.

729
00:53:10,817 --> 00:53:12,522
Speaker 1: so that's 60 right.

730
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:13,826
Speaker 1: it's like all right.

731
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:20,407
Speaker 1: so I have to buy with my money a winning hand right for less than 60.

732
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:23,901
Speaker 1: I'm not willing to pay out a total of more than 60 to get a winning hand.

733
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:34,634
Speaker 1: if I buy something and I don't either a win or B sell those cards I bought for a higher value I just lost right money.

734
00:53:34,654 --> 00:53:37,423
Speaker 1: so it's like every move has to be profitable.

735
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:43,123
Speaker 1: so it's really tight and there's not a lot of winning lines right.

736
00:53:43,204 --> 00:53:44,028
Speaker 1: and it's sort of like.

737
00:53:44,169 --> 00:53:47,564
Speaker 1: are you gonna try to be a seller or are you gonna try to be a winner?

738
00:53:47,584 --> 00:53:51,079
Speaker 1: if you try to be a winner you're gonna spend very.

739
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:55,388
Speaker 1: you know very little which means the people who are trying to be sellers can't make.

740
00:54:01,242 --> 00:54:03,695
Speaker 1: it's like basically whoever got that first pot ended up.

741
00:54:03,755 --> 00:54:07,451
Speaker 1: that was it was so much money because we were all so cheap.

742
00:54:07,852 --> 00:54:12,497
Speaker 1: but if you weren't cheap if you just tried to spend it all it's like well there you go you want.

743
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:13,101
Speaker 1: you didn't make that.

744
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:14,565
Speaker 1: you're in the modern art situation of.

745
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:15,789
Speaker 0: I spent $40 to win $32.

746
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:16,230
Speaker 0: great yeah.

747
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:26,166
Speaker 0: and the only strategy at that point is you would take a loss to prevent someone else from getting a pot.

748
00:54:26,788 --> 00:54:28,674
Speaker 0: but if it would be profitable for them.

749
00:54:29,156 --> 00:54:32,488
Speaker 0: but that breaks down to and the game just kind of fell apart.

750
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,018
Speaker 0: and it was just I still.

751
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:35,279
Speaker 1: yeah.

752
00:54:35,299 --> 00:54:35,822
Speaker 1: so I think there were.

753
00:54:36,263 --> 00:54:39,938
Speaker 1: there was a lot to learn from the concepts going on here.

754
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:45,145
Speaker 1: I just think it needs some tweaking in like the numbers department and also in the auction department.

755
00:54:45,205 --> 00:54:57,484
Speaker 0: but I feel like if you do those tweaks will you just end up in modern art and you might because modern art kind of did this like as best you can do without adding more complexity which isn't necessarily a thing in a game like that.

756
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:02,203
Speaker 1: yeah so this is a case where I mean this game does predate modern.

757
00:55:02,263 --> 00:55:03,547
Speaker 0: yeah right I did I think pretty sure.

758
00:55:03,547 --> 00:55:10,685
Speaker 0: 1969 versus modern art board game by kinesia.

759
00:55:10,785 --> 00:55:12,548
Speaker 0: yep modern art.

760
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:13,150
Speaker 0: let's see 1992.

761
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:23,299
Speaker 1: yeah so you know it's like playing the proto version of a game you know is great right as opposed to usually.

762
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:30,632
Speaker 1: you know these days we're playing like remakes and polished redone versions of games right like we're playing the small world.

763
00:55:30,753 --> 00:55:32,925
Speaker 1: after the vintage is we've already been playing the Vinci.

764
00:55:33,207 --> 00:55:34,093
Speaker 1: this is the opposite.

765
00:55:34,154 --> 00:55:36,125
Speaker 1: it's like imagine if he only ever played small world.

766
00:55:36,145 --> 00:55:39,181
Speaker 1: I mean I guess that's a bad example cuz he like Vinci better.

767
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:48,997
Speaker 1: so it's like you know if you had only ever played you know Resident Evil remakes and then one day you go back and try to play the original.

768
00:55:49,158 --> 00:55:49,921
Speaker 1: it's like you can.

769
00:55:50,463 --> 00:55:52,311
Speaker 1: you can see what was going on there.

770
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,355
Speaker 1: there's a lot to learn.

771
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:54,821
Speaker 1: there's value in that.

772
00:55:55,142 --> 00:55:57,429
Speaker 1: but also it's not as good.

773
00:55:57,449 --> 00:55:59,536
Speaker 1: yeah it's just not as good.

774
00:55:59,596 --> 00:56:02,087
Speaker 0: I do think it is absolutely worth playing.

775
00:56:02,127 --> 00:56:15,648
Speaker 0: if you were interested in game design at all just because the experience of playing it and then seeing how the bidding breaks down or you might have a friend who's bad at bidding games and it doesn't break down and that'll be funny for different reasons.

776
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:24,186
Speaker 1: but I think you could also tweak the numbers and if you got a bunch of people to play it multiple times that you might be able to develop.

777
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:26,134
Speaker 1: you know a meta right.

778
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:26,696
Speaker 1: that could work.

779
00:56:27,078 --> 00:56:28,705
Speaker 0: I think so it's possible.

780
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:44,062
Speaker 0: the problem I think the problem we ran into is that the game as written I feel like the meta we encountered in our first playthrough is an extremely strong attractor for people who are skeptical of the value of the second pot.

781
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:50,661
Speaker 0: yes and I do not imagine a world where the first pot is sold for so much.

782
00:56:51,444 --> 00:57:02,390
Speaker 1: anyway I suppose there's a world in which you sort of try to shoot the moon in which you pay a lot to get the first pot on like a break even and then get your money back in the second pot.

783
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:14,678
Speaker 1: also because you've got all these cards left over that you like you're buying for the first pot and you've got so many cards left over you can get the second pot also to get your cash back but that would be tough.

784
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:20,632
Speaker 0: this has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
