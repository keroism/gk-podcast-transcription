1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,168
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, September 28th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:10,389
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:13,719
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,943
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:22,040
Speaker 1: Tonight we are reviewing Janelle Monae's "The Age of Pleasure" tour as we saw at Radio City.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,778
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

7
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:31,478
Speaker 1: So the other night, we were hungry, busy, and we decided we should order some pizza, like you do.

8
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:32,280
Speaker 1: It's New York City.

9
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:37,372
Speaker 1: Lot of options for pizza, and we have like three or four places that we tend to rotate through.

10
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,600
Speaker 1: that we know have good pizza or good kinds of pizza we like.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,266
Speaker 0: Why don't you rotate?

12
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:42,860
Speaker 0: Wouldn't one of them just be the best one?

13
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:46,788
Speaker 1: If I want a Sicilian style, we go order from Rizzo's.

14
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:50,616
Speaker 1: If I want like a fancy boutique pizza, we go to Milkflower.

15
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,560
Speaker 1: Those are two different kinds of pizza.

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,520
Speaker 0: Milkflower delivers to you, huh?

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,563
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, it does.

18
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:56,510
Speaker 1: It's a problem, actually, that they deliver here.

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,076
Speaker 1: It's a big problem.

20
00:00:58,096 --> 00:00:59,160
Speaker 1: That's a real easy lunch.

21
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:01,779
Speaker 0: I thought they'd be far away for you to reach them.

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, for whatever reason, they deliver to us, and I'm not going to complain about that.

23
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,000
Speaker 1: It arrives crazy hot.

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,474
Speaker 1: So, uh, I decide, you know, I just look, let's see if there's anything that delivers.

25
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:13,838
Speaker 1: that I don't remember.

26
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:14,620
Speaker 1: Like something new.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,219
Speaker 1: And I go into the old group room.

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:16,900
Speaker 0: Uh oh, danger.

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, just to see.

30
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:25,034
Speaker 1: And I see that not too far away is a place that is definitely new that I've never seen before.

31
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:27,960
Speaker 1: They're called Detroit Pizza Works.

32
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:29,920
Speaker 0: Well, that doesn't sound good at all.

33
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,641
Speaker 1: Now, that sounds great for me in that- You're in New York.

34
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:34,085
Speaker 0: First of all, you're in New York.

35
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,791
Speaker 0: You're literally in New York City, living there.

36
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:40,860
Speaker 0: Why the hell would you want literally any city that's not New York pizza?

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,571
Speaker 1: Honestly, you're weird about this.

38
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:43,718
Speaker 0: I like Chicago style pizza.

39
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,453
Speaker 0: Can you imagine a California pizza kitchen opening up in New York?

40
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:54,357
Speaker 1: It's like that makes every other place- I know, but I'm just saying, it's in every other place- I mean, California pizza, the style is just bad pizza.

41
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:54,619
Speaker 1: It's not.

42
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:04,800
Speaker 0: Literally every place on the entire face of the earth that has pizza places, they call their place New York pizza, even if it's not New York pizza at all.

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,180
Speaker 0: But there are places called New York pizza in basically every pizza eating country on the earth.

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,985
Speaker 0: Yet, why?

45
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:17,340
Speaker 0: So if you're actually in real New York with real New York pizza, there is no reason.

46
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,726
Speaker 1: Because I don't always want a New York style pizza.

47
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,289
Speaker 1: I like a Chicago style pizza.

48
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,640
Speaker 1: In fact, I even like the extremist form of Chicago style pizza.

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,102
Speaker 0: The one where- I was in Chicago.

50
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:35,660
Speaker 0: so briefly, I was not able to eat the thing which may be delicious, looks delicious, but- I agree with you that- May semantically not be accurately called pizza.

51
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:57,539
Speaker 1: I agree with you that calling Chicago style pizza, especially the most extreme form of it that's basically just like a three inch thick casserole with a top- I don't think calling that pizza makes sense, but regardless, Detroit style pizza is a distinct style of pizza that I do enjoy.

52
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,060
Speaker 1: I like it.

53
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:02,891
Speaker 1: It's got some attributes, but you can make good and bad Detroit style pizza.

54
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,014
Speaker 1: You wouldn't even have to call it Detroit.

55
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:06,380
Speaker 1: That's just the place that kind of was popular for a lot of reasons.

56
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:09,285
Speaker 1: But anyway, I think, oh, Detroit style pizza.

57
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:16,420
Speaker 1: Because on that century I did a while ago, I bumped into a bunch of people who were biking up near Poughkeepsie on the train home.

58
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:31,819
Speaker 1: And a couple of them were from Detroit and they told me about a place down by the village called Lions Tigers and Squares that sells just Detroit style pizza and is Detroit themed around the Detroit sports teams.

59
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:32,880
Speaker 1: It's like a whole thing going on.

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,760
Speaker 0: And I asked them like- I guess as a Detroit person who moved to New York for some reason.

61
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,021
Speaker 0: Yeah.

62
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:45,120
Speaker 0: So they got a bunch of Red Wings shit all over the walls and Tigers- If they love Detroit so much, I guess, you know, do they really love Detroit that much if they keep their living here?

63
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:48,920
Speaker 1: I mean, I love Detroit, but I want to live in New York.

64
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:51,404
Speaker 0: There are like people like that.

65
00:03:51,464 --> 00:04:03,060
Speaker 0: Like any city you go to, you'll always find like these people who are from somewhere else and like express, you know, love and- The old country, like I agree, the family from Sicily with the pizza.

66
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,723
Speaker 0: To where they're from, right?

67
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:07,269
Speaker 0: And it's like, all right, you know, I see that.

68
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:12,700
Speaker 0: But it's like, if you really like where you're from, why are you not, you know, living there?

69
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,231
Speaker 1: Some people are refugees.

70
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,046
Speaker 1: Like say you really like- That's a real reason.

71
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,839
Speaker 0: I'm talking about, you know, the people who don't appear to have a real reason.

72
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,300
Speaker 1: Or what if you like Detroit, but there ain't no jobs there because of capitalism?

73
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:31,259
Speaker 1: I mean, you know- I mean, you and I are in New York for a lot of reasons.

74
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,620
Speaker 0: I feel like though, if New York Detroited and Detroit New Yorked, that I'd stay in New York, even if it was Detroity.

75
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,482
Speaker 1: It would depend.

76
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:42,547
Speaker 1: It would really depend.

77
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:44,452
Speaker 1: The problem is New York is unique.

78
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:46,336
Speaker 1: You know, that whole Alpha Global City thing.

79
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:47,800
Speaker 1: Only London and New York are in that category.

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why it's better.

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, but because New York has a subway system.

82
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,410
Speaker 1: Like, nobody has this.

83
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,179
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I wonder, oh, I wonder if it's a thing like that.

84
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:11,460
Speaker 1: But I also am cautious because as my reputation precedes me among our friends and for the listeners of this show, I am cynical, jaded, pessimistic, and cautious.

85
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:15,373
Speaker 1: I am willing to bail the drop of a hat on anything.

86
00:05:15,393 --> 00:05:17,460
Speaker 1: I don't trust anything I see on the internet.

87
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:25,040
Speaker 1: So I think, alright, let's make sure this isn't a ghost kitchen because a lot of restaurants on Grubhub are ghost kitchens.

88
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:35,320
Speaker 0: The name like that, especially since I haven't seen it, I haven't seen the storefront, I would bet ghost kitchens.

89
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,189
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, so I type it into Google Maps and there are no results.

90
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,800
Speaker 1: In fact, all it recommends is that Lions, Tigers, and Squares place in the village.

91
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:49,532
Speaker 1: Alright, so I give them the benefit of the doubt and I decide, what if they're just brand new?

92
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:52,580
Speaker 1: So I actually look at the address that's registered in Grubhub.

93
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,723
Speaker 0: That's going to tell you exactly what it is, right?

94
00:05:55,825 --> 00:06:00,291
Speaker 0: Because even the diner that's a block away from us.

95
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:06,200
Speaker 0: that was just on Kitchen Nightmares, I haven't seen the episode.

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,065
Speaker 0: I'm going to try to see it because I don't hate that show.

97
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:16,680
Speaker 0: But even if I hated the show, I'd probably still watch the episode about the diner a block away from us that we've eaten at many times.

98
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:24,734
Speaker 0: But anyway, even them, they operate like 100 ghost kitchen entries in Grubhub, right?

99
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:26,577
Speaker 0: But they all use the same address.

100
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:28,240
Speaker 0: so you know exactly that it's them.

101
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:40,000
Speaker 1: There's a ton of ghost kitchens that have an address that's basically a parking lot kind of under the Queensborough Bridge and if you sort Grubhub by distance from you, you see a lot of really cagey shit.

102
00:06:42,422 --> 00:06:49,838
Speaker 1: So I look on Google Maps, I go to the address and it's kind of by the Astoria Kaufman Theaters and I'm thinking, there's no pizza place there.

103
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,027
Speaker 1: Like did a pizza place- There's a Napoli- no, there's literally the- Hold on, there's pizza places.

104
00:06:55,108 --> 00:07:01,091
Speaker 1: I knew about there who I was confident- There's sacks that's underneath, literally right over there.

105
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,275
Speaker 0: There's the Napoli one.

106
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:03,680
Speaker 0: that's a few blocks away.

107
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:10,280
Speaker 1: Like a place a pizza place would go that didn't already have a pizza place that I was pretty sure didn't go out of business since the last time I was over there.

108
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:17,159
Speaker 0: But the point is yes, I know that area, I know the pizza places that are near that area, there are a few, and none of them are Detroit pizza places.

109
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,660
Speaker 1: And I feel like I would've noticed the last time I was over there.

110
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:22,040
Speaker 0: I was there recently.

111
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:31,900
Speaker 1: So then I do the old Google Street View and I drop my little yellow guy in the Google Street View and what do I fucking see at that address?

112
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:33,817
Speaker 1: A Pizzeria Uno!

113
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the one next to the Applebee's.

114
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,179
Speaker 1: Yup, it's the one next to the Applebee's.

115
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,120
Speaker 0: Literally, Astoria is interesting in that all of Astoria, we don't really have- like there's a couple McDonald's.

116
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,496
Speaker 0: Even Wildwood has the McDonald's.

117
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,204
Speaker 0: Duncan Donuts is, right?

118
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:52,980
Speaker 0: But for the most part, I guess there's a Chipotle now and a Target, right?

119
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,083
Speaker 0: But it's like.

120
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:58,980
Speaker 0: yes, there are those businesses that are chains, but actually they're like few and far between.

121
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:07,100
Speaker 0: Like we're talking like one or two per street and every other business on all the streets is some sort of New York-y business.

122
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,857
Speaker 0: They might be chains, but they're not those big chains that are like that.

123
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:20,140
Speaker 0: But in that one area, there's an Applebee's, a Panera, and an Uno Pizzeria all right next to each other in that one spot.

124
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,520
Speaker 1: Yup, and they're all clustered by a big parking garage that people drive to and park to go to the theater and eat out.

125
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:36,380
Speaker 0: Right, it's like this one spot that's like a little suburb that's like the border of Astoria and the rest of, you know, further east Queens.

126
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,777
Speaker 0: Has all this suburb shit all gathered.

127
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,299
Speaker 1: Against my better nature.

128
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,159
Speaker 0: Huddling together for safety against, you know, real life.

129
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,780
Speaker 1: But against my chorus nature, I decide to go one step further.

130
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,428
Speaker 1: Don't worry, I didn't order this fucking pizza.

131
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,015
Speaker 1: Like do not think this is where this is going.

132
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:52,920
Speaker 1: I am not stupid.

133
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,860
Speaker 1: But I wonder for a brief second, the bears glimmer of hope that I decide to entertain instead of crush.

134
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:03,656
Speaker 1: What if the Uno somehow went out of business and I didn't notice?

135
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,540
Speaker 1: because why would I notice?

136
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,060
Speaker 0: No, it definitely is still there.

137
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:06,896
Speaker 1: And someone bought it.

138
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,260
Speaker 0: Because I've never eaten there, obviously.

139
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,428
Speaker 1: Because I don't see Uno.

140
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:13,360
Speaker 1: It's one of those things like a billboard where my brain just ad blocks it.

141
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:14,200
Speaker 1: I don't even think about it.

142
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:14,758
Speaker 0: No, it's there.

143
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:20,718
Speaker 1: It's like that scene in Westworld where she looks at the picture of the outside world and she's like, "Doesn't look like anything at all to

144
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:20,919
Speaker 1: me.".

145
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,007
Speaker 1: So I Google for Detroit Pizza Kitchen and I will not link to this website because it is like.

146
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:38,626
Speaker 1: every reference to this place that I can find is on a website like Pizza Marketplace that is aimed at SEO nonsense and people who are in the bad pizza business.

147
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:43,640
Speaker 1: Like someone who's like an executive at a place that invests in Sbarro's type garbage.

148
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:51,220
Speaker 1: And yeah, Uno decided to make a bunch of ghost kitchens not associated with their brand to sell Detroit style pizza.

149
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,747
Speaker 1: And this article had a picture of the pizza they're selling.

150
00:09:55,368 --> 00:10:00,760
Speaker 1: And that does not look even remotely like a Detroit style pizza.

151
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,478
Speaker 1: It looks exactly like a regular ass fucking Pizzeria Uno pizza with no changes.

152
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:09,966
Speaker 1: So there you have it.

153
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,111
Speaker 1: Do not order.

154
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:13,019
Speaker 1: Detroit Pizza Works pizza.

155
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what I have to say about Pizzeria Uno is that when I was young, and we loved pizza, and we were from New York.

156
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,939
Speaker 1: And when I was young, I would eat any pizza.

157
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,068
Speaker 0: We were people from New York living in Connecticut, you know.

158
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:24,331
Speaker 0: We had pizza.

159
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:25,775
Speaker 0: We knew what good pizza was.

160
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,540
Speaker 0: We knew the best pizzas in Connecticut.

161
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, I grew up in Detroit.

162
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:32,040
Speaker 1: We would go sit down at the Pizza Hut to eat pizza sometimes.

163
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,589
Speaker 0: And Pizzeria Uno opened in, I think, Fairfield.

164
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,653
Speaker 0: And it was big.

165
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:39,040
Speaker 0: It was this big place, you know, physically.

166
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:40,503
Speaker 0: And it was new.

167
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:41,726
Speaker 0: We hadn't seen it before.

168
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:43,231
Speaker 0: We didn't realize it was a chain.

169
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:46,320
Speaker 0: We thought it was, or if it was a chain, it felt like it was the first one.

170
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,130
Speaker 0: Sort of like when Blockbuster first showed up.

171
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,680
Speaker 0: It was around that same time, I think.

172
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:53,072
Speaker 0: Where it's like this big new video store opened up.

173
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,720
Speaker 0: We didn't realize it was a chain yet.

174
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,250
Speaker 0: It was like the only one that we had ever seen or ever heard of.

175
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:02,278
Speaker 0: So we were like, oh, a giant new pizza place.

176
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:03,300
Speaker 0: Let's go check that out.

177
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,683
Speaker 0: We're kind of excited, right?

178
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:05,705
Speaker 0: Like, ooh, right?

179
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:12,180
Speaker 0: You know, and I get there and the pizza was, even when I was a kid, and it was like, this is terrible.

180
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,263
Speaker 0: This is right.

181
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:18,740
Speaker 0: Because I guess I had already, even at that young single digit age, had a taste for New York pizza.

182
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:26,300
Speaker 1: Now, there was a time in my life around middle school where the only thing that mattered in terms of food to me was quantity.

183
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:34,680
Speaker 0: I think this was pre-middle school, but regardless, literally, can you imagine a kid eating a pizza and being like, ew, I don't want this.

184
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,191
Speaker 0: A kid who likes pizza and ate pizza from other places.

185
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:42,360
Speaker 0: I didn't start hating pizza altogether or anything.

186
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:49,740
Speaker 1: Like if I was forced to stack rank restaurants, there are restaurants where I would eat at the Uno before I would eat at them.

187
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,860
Speaker 1: But you're already at the bottom of the barrel next to Burger King and Jack in the Box.

188
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,444
Speaker 0: Right, yeah.

189
00:11:56,845 --> 00:12:02,780
Speaker 0: So since that time, single digit age, last millennium, I have managed to, I guess it wasn't that hard.

190
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:09,440
Speaker 0: I have never eaten at an Uno's Pizzeria since then, and I have no plans to for the rest of my days.

191
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,459
Speaker 1: So yeah, you got any news?

192
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:17,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got camera-related news and thing of the day.

193
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:25,900
Speaker 0: So, Nikons, I guess semi-surprised everyone except for all of the people who do camera reviews, because they all got preview units.

194
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,789
Speaker 0: They announced this new camera called the Nikon ZF.

195
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:35,040
Speaker 0: So this came out of nowhere, basically, at least as far as I could tell.

196
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:41,057
Speaker 0: It is something that people kind of wanted, because there was a previous camera, the Nikon ZF-C.

197
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:57,880
Speaker 0: And what the ZF-C was, was sort of a unique camera in that the shape of the camera physically, the interface of it, if you didn't get close to it, you'd think it was an old film SLR camera with the dials on it and everything, right?

198
00:12:58,522 --> 00:13:01,820
Speaker 0: Only slightly smaller and obviously digital.

199
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:11,840
Speaker 0: But it had an APS-C size sensor, which if you didn't know, is bigger than a Micro Four Thirds sensor, but smaller than a "full frame" sensor.

200
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,994
Speaker 0: Full frame is basically the size of a frame on a 35mm film negative, right?

201
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:32,020
Speaker 0: And so, that was a cool camera, the Nikon ZF-C, but it wasn't that inspiring for people to go get it, because the quality of the actual photos was decent.

202
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:39,100
Speaker 0: It was cool looking, right interface, right shape, but it was kind of plasticky, right?

203
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:57,258
Speaker 0: It was like, if you're making a camera in that shape of old school controls, you're appealing to people who care about photos, so putting technology in it that is not somewhat high end makes those people go, "Well, I like the shape, but...".

204
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:10,060
Speaker 0: So, sort of dominating that space, there are surprisingly few higher end digital cameras that have an old school user interface, right?

205
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,229
Speaker 0: Basically, Fuji makes those, right?

206
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:14,974
Speaker 0: And the X100 that I have is like an old ragefinder.

207
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,359
Speaker 0: The X-Pro3 is discontinued, we're waiting for an X-Pro4, which I might buy if they ever make one.

208
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:25,250
Speaker 0: Then there's the XT whatevers, right?

209
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,040
Speaker 0: Those are sort of the same, they look like old school SLRs.

210
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:33,960
Speaker 0: And then, of course, there's the $10,000 Leica cameras, which look like our old school rangefinders.

211
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,604
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much it, that's it.

212
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:41,280
Speaker 0: That's the list of cameras that are modern digital cameras, but are in the shape of an old camera.

213
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,820
Speaker 0: All the other digital cameras are basically the shape of a digital camera, right?

214
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:50,532
Speaker 0: Which, you know, why are digital cameras that shape?

215
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,780
Speaker 0: Is that the best shape a camera can be, right?

216
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,260
Speaker 0: That's sort of the question that's being challenged, right?

217
00:14:55,982 --> 00:15:01,060
Speaker 1: Well, remember, there was a bunch of cameras that were basically just a lens, like a little sensor on it.

218
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,030
Speaker 0: Oh, but those are video cameras.

219
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,000
Speaker 0: You can't use that for photography, really, right?

220
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,040
Speaker 0: You need some sort of either optical or digital viewfinder to do, and some sort of interface.

221
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,900
Speaker 0: You know, when you have a camera that's just a box, it's because you're controlling it from far away.

222
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,639
Speaker 1: But it might be boxed with that little grippy on the right side is like one of those U.X.

223
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:20,020
Speaker 1: designs.

224
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:26,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's still all the, you do photography where you're walking around, you need all the controls on the thing.

225
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,325
Speaker 0: That's not what those are for.

226
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:32,160
Speaker 0: Anyway, those are for video and film and things of that nature.

227
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:35,500
Speaker 0: I mean, not that these cameras don't do video, they all do because of digital cameras.

228
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,559
Speaker 0: So the Nikon ZF, they come out and they're like, all right, here it is.

229
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:44,740
Speaker 0: It's like the Nikon ZFC, only bigger with the thirty five millimeter sensor.

230
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:46,523
Speaker 0: Right.

231
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:49,151
Speaker 0: And fancier and et cetera.

232
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:51,880
Speaker 0: And people and it's only two thousand dollars.

233
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,995
Speaker 0: Now, two thousand dollars is a lot of money in just the scheme of things.

234
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,400
Speaker 0: That's like a computer.

235
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:58,601
Speaker 0: Right.

236
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:08,580
Speaker 0: But if you compare that to basically the competition, you know, the Fuji X-T5 is seventeen hundred dollars.

237
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:10,807
Speaker 0: And this has a bigger sensor than that.

238
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:11,148
Speaker 0: Right.

239
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:14,097
Speaker 0: The Nikon Z six two.

240
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:14,217
Speaker 0: Right.

241
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,893
Speaker 0: Which is basically the equivalent Nikon is.

242
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:19,300
Speaker 0: it has a like a lot of hope.

243
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,740
Speaker 0: They do the thing where they have like the same camera and they go mega time, mega tea, right.

244
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,565
Speaker 0: Slightly better upgrades.

245
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:30,940
Speaker 0: So it's like this, the Z nine, the Z eight, the Z seven, the Z six, the Z five.

246
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:32,243
Speaker 0: And right.

247
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:34,169
Speaker 0: And they're all slightly better.

248
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:38,180
Speaker 0: You know, basically, as the number goes down, the camera gets slightly worse and slightly cheaper.

249
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:45,540
Speaker 0: The ZF is basically the same as the Z six to only a little bit better than that, actually.

250
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:48,146
Speaker 0: But it's the same price as the Z six two.

251
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:54,100
Speaker 0: And it has a. you know, in my opinion, I'd rather have the old school control shape than the digital camera shape.

252
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:02,760
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it's like a really good to grad with no lens and the two default lens options don't look too bad based on my skin.

253
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, you would say I think you would take the 40 millimeter one point.

254
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,720
Speaker 1: I feel like that's the one I would take if I was going to get that's the one that goes with it.

255
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,742
Speaker 0: Right.

256
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:16,359
Speaker 0: So it's like this whole there isn't really like a competitor for this camera.

257
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:16,701
Speaker 0: Right.

258
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:21,079
Speaker 0: It's like if you want the full frame sensor, well, Fuji doesn't have that.

259
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:27,760
Speaker 0: Fuji does either smaller sensors, APC or Fuji does big sensor, medium format.

260
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,468
Speaker 0: They have a they're sort of not trying to compete with.

261
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:34,720
Speaker 1: like a medium format is the same effective scale as a medium tank.

262
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:35,829
Speaker 1: When you talk about tanks.

263
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:37,019
Speaker 0: Exactly.

264
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:42,580
Speaker 1: Because this large format and then there's four by five, there's mega tank.

265
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:43,642
Speaker 0: Yeah.

266
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:49,320
Speaker 0: You can get a camera that takes photos that are just the net, you know, eight and a half by eleven, like boom, paper size.

267
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:51,478
Speaker 0: You could do bigger than that, too.

268
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:59,140
Speaker 0: Anyway, basically anything bigger than medium format is just called large at the even though there's many, many.

269
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,220
Speaker 0: But regardless, for quote, full frame is thirty five millimeter.

270
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,681
Speaker 0: Right.

271
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,002
Speaker 0: Which is whoever came up with.

272
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:17,580
Speaker 0: deciding to call that full is like a marketing genius because they basically by calling that by using the word full, they in every photographer's mind, they've made anything smaller than that feel inferior.

273
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:18,986
Speaker 0: The same thing happened.

274
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,940
Speaker 0: I read anything bigger than that feel excessive.

275
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,144
Speaker 1: I read an essay years ago that made an argument.

276
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:32,500
Speaker 1: It was talking about marketing and it was talking about how calling it a high definition HD, regardless of, you know, seven, twenty one, ten, eighty, like all that nonsense.

277
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,380
Speaker 1: That was the death knell to the previous generation of all displays, regardless of if the technology actually looked better yet.

278
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:42,746
Speaker 0: I mean, you look, Apple ran out of words.

279
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,471
Speaker 0: They're already at ultra Apple watches.

280
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:45,273
Speaker 0: It's like, that's it.

281
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:47,660
Speaker 0: We don't have words bigger than that done.

282
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:49,363
Speaker 0: Fine.

283
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:51,815
Speaker 0: This is really the final watch.

284
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:52,720
Speaker 1: Final format.

285
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:56,860
Speaker 0: The point is, if you want a camera, the fatal for this sensor size.

286
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:57,662
Speaker 0: Right.

287
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:58,767
Speaker 0: There are many to choose from.

288
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:01,600
Speaker 0: If you want a digital camera with the sensor size, many to choose from.

289
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:08,460
Speaker 0: But if you want one with this sensor size, that is an old school shape with the dials and whatever.

290
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,860
Speaker 0: The only options are this, which is SLR shaped and the Leica, the Leica, which is rangefinder shaped.

291
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:20,660
Speaker 0: So if you're oh, if you're going to narrow it to SLR shaped, this is a unique camera, right?

292
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:26,119
Speaker 0: There is no existing camera that combines those elements together other than this.

293
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:28,428
Speaker 1: Now I'm looking up at staring at me.

294
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:31,259
Speaker 1: on my desk is my ancient DX1 that I'm still using.

295
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,540
Speaker 0: So, yeah, so it's like I'm sort of waiting, like, you know, the X100, which is the Fuji rangefinder with the smaller sensor.

296
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:39,002
Speaker 0: Right.

297
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:43,460
Speaker 0: Of all the cameras I have, I use that camera more than all the others combined.

298
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:45,944
Speaker 0: But you can't even get.

299
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:52,380
Speaker 0: they have the X100V, which came out a while ago, which is it's such a hot item right now.

300
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:54,869
Speaker 0: Like I bought the X100F before they were hot.

301
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:55,130
Speaker 0: Right.

302
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,177
Speaker 0: It's like the X100V is so hot.

303
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:57,799
Speaker 0: You can't get them.

304
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,927
Speaker 0: People are you know, you could probably sell.

305
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:05,160
Speaker 0: you could buy sell one for more than it costs you to buy it right now because it's so hot.

306
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:12,279
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, I use that camera the most, but it's getting a little long in the tooth.

307
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:12,480
Speaker 0: Right.

308
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,946
Speaker 0: It's not getting the updates.

309
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,672
Speaker 0: It doesn't have the USB-C.

310
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:17,580
Speaker 0: It doesn't work with the new Fuji app.

311
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,240
Speaker 0: It, you know, features on the newer ones that I kind of actually would use.

312
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:24,567
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, I'm waiting.

313
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:27,940
Speaker 0: But then this camera comes along and it's like, hey, you sure you want to keep waiting?

314
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:29,959
Speaker 0: And I'm like, oh, well, I don't know.

315
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:40,800
Speaker 0: I think what I'm going to do is I'll wait, you know, for this to actually show up at the camera store in a couple of months rather than throw two thousand dollars on a purchase of something I can't touch.

316
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:41,261
Speaker 1: Right.

317
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:41,944
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.

318
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:45,360
Speaker 0: And I'll go I'll go play with one for free and see what the deal is.

319
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,601
Speaker 0: Right.

320
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:51,360
Speaker 0: But yeah, this is an interesting surprise camera out of nowhere.

321
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,238
Speaker 0: So it's worth noting even to not camera people to be like, you know.

322
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:57,801
Speaker 1: Yeah.

323
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:08,360
Speaker 1: So in some other news, and we won't dwell on these because these both of these could be like their own show and you should just go to the real news media to learn about what happened.

324
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,779
Speaker 1: So first, the the writers strike is over.

325
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,809
Speaker 1: The WGA has voted to lift the strike order.

326
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:17,680
Speaker 1: The strike lasted one hundred and forty eight days.

327
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:22,439
Speaker 0: And by all accounts, imagine not getting paid for one hundred and forty eight days.

328
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,846
Speaker 0: Would you be able to make it?

329
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:25,395
Speaker 1: I would.

330
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:26,199
Speaker 1: But right.

331
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,290
Speaker 0: But and how much suffering for would that be?

332
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,980
Speaker 0: And would you go through that suffering?

333
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:32,983
Speaker 0: Right.

334
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:33,829
Speaker 0: Is it worth it?

335
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,520
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, I got the right outcome.

336
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,000
Speaker 1: I mean, think about as young kids often don't remember and don't pay attention to middle school.

337
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:50,260
Speaker 1: The only reason we have weekends off is because a whole bunch of union people basically suffered getting attacked and murdered by Pinkertons for a long time.

338
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,960
Speaker 0: So it's like you had to be thankful to the people and respectful.

339
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,520
Speaker 0: Right.

340
00:21:54,540 --> 00:22:01,520
Speaker 0: And and, you know, glory to them that they have, you know, they suffered greatly to to bring about this good end.

341
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,066
Speaker 0: But also think about yourself.

342
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:04,551
Speaker 0: It's like you want to.

343
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,960
Speaker 0: you want to have good ends and change the world.

344
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,478
Speaker 0: It's like you had to be ready to do that kind of suffering.

345
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:09,700
Speaker 0: Right.

346
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:13,280
Speaker 1: So so you can read the details when the time comes.

347
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:24,440
Speaker 1: The key gains are really important because what's fascinating is the last time there was a strike in this space, it sort of resolved as a compromise where nobody was super happy, but it was like a slight step forward.

348
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:29,540
Speaker 1: All the writers I see talking about this are saying this is like transformative.

349
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:34,780
Speaker 1: It was a complete and total victory, which is not the rhetoric I expected.

350
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,446
Speaker 0: But you don't see that too often.

351
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:38,720
Speaker 0: Usually you see a pretty big compromise.

352
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

353
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:43,240
Speaker 1: Well, meanwhile, UAW, remember the autoworkers, one of their demands is four day workweek.

354
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,149
Speaker 0: So, yeah, that's right.

355
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:47,200
Speaker 1: So key points.

356
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:47,720
Speaker 1: Go.

357
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:59,360
Speaker 1: The writers rooms have minimum sizes now and TV show like minimum staffing levels, payment terms for screenwriters, guaranteed second looks and follow ups, all the stuff that makes sure writers actually get paid.

358
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,703
Speaker 1: Which was not happening.

359
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:08,500
Speaker 1: Huge, huge limitations on where and how I can be used in the process at any point.

360
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:19,500
Speaker 1: Companies basically can't use anyone's writing output for fucking anything without their explicit written approval, their statutory rules around where and how they could even give that approval.

361
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,783
Speaker 1: There's a whole.

362
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:25,180
Speaker 1: it's almost all the talking points here are around restrictions on how I can be used.

363
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:26,061
Speaker 0: Yep.

364
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:41,900
Speaker 0: My only concern is that, you know, this guarantees basically that if someone is going to produce some Hollywood media that is written and requires writing, you know, and they're going to use union labor, which they are.

365
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,662
Speaker 0: Because otherwise you're going to be.

366
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:44,543
Speaker 0: all the other unions are.

367
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:45,044
Speaker 0: It's going to.

368
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:45,945
Speaker 0: you're not going to work out.

369
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:46,146
Speaker 0: Right.

370
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:46,707
Speaker 0: Yeah.

371
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,708
Speaker 1: I think in our lifetime there won't be.

372
00:23:57,748 --> 00:24:01,180
Speaker 1: there will be entire Hollywood movies made without a single human being involved.

373
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,964
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, even if they don't use the eyes of the M.L.

374
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:05,705
Speaker 0: right.

375
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:18,920
Speaker 0: I really don't like saying I even if they don't use machine learning tools to do to replace writers, they are going to drastically reduce the amount of written content produced.

376
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,530
Speaker 0: And they're going to continue to increase their focus on the non-written content.

377
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,871
Speaker 0: Yep.

378
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:26,393
Speaker 0: Right.

379
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:30,200
Speaker 0: And if you look at television, I think especially right.

380
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,164
Speaker 0: You know, the NFL is the only thing keeping cable alive.

381
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:34,465
Speaker 0: Yeah.

382
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:44,520
Speaker 1: And for those of you who don't live sports in general, non-written content is is code for sports and reality TV, except for pro wrestling is written.

383
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,021
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

384
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:46,603
Speaker 0: But not other sports.

385
00:24:46,743 --> 00:24:46,924
Speaker 0: Right.

386
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:57,540
Speaker 0: And but yeah, it's like, you know, you look around and it's like a lot of the stuff that's, you know, carrying the load, especially television is not written.

387
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:11,380
Speaker 0: So well, because the underlying reasons I wonder how many writers it's like, I think, you know, I wonder it's like the writers who are still going to be working are going to be treated properly.

388
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:12,261
Speaker 0: Right.

389
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:13,163
Speaker 0: With this new deal.

390
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:16,809
Speaker 0: I wonder how many writers won't be able to find work.

391
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:18,612
Speaker 1: That is the same concern.

392
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:21,897
Speaker 0: There is less money going out to writer.

393
00:25:21,957 --> 00:25:23,660
Speaker 0: They just have less jobs now.

394
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,262
Speaker 0: They just decrease the that.

395
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:30,371
Speaker 1: So one, that is the right wing's primary talking point against unions that it causes that outcome.

396
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:35,960
Speaker 1: But to it is a real concern, but they're they're concerned for fake reasons, of course.

397
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,947
Speaker 1: Like, don't fuck the right wing, but obviously that is how all of labor is gone.

398
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:49,580
Speaker 1: Look at how labor is going now, which there are jobs that still pay a lot and are highly skilled and require people like people like us to do this kind of work.

399
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,142
Speaker 1: There aren't that many of them.

400
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:54,545
Speaker 1: And most people, there's no jobs for them.

401
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:56,747
Speaker 1: And if they can even find a job, it pays fucking nothing.

402
00:25:57,368 --> 00:26:08,720
Speaker 1: And all unions are doing is protecting the tiniest bastions of what they can protect of a world where capitalism doesn't literally destroy everything.

403
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:11,622
Speaker 1: At some point, it all has to give.

404
00:26:11,743 --> 00:26:13,405
Speaker 1: But that's a topic for another day.

405
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,746
Speaker 1: This was a huge victory.

406
00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:19,612
Speaker 1: And hopefully this will force the rest of the strike to resolve on good terms.

407
00:26:19,832 --> 00:26:26,100
Speaker 1: This is ammo in the UAW's pocket that maybe they should fight just as hard and go and go just as hard.

408
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:33,626
Speaker 1: And I encourage any of you out there, if you work at a place that's not unionized, sniff around and see if you can unionize.

409
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:49,760
Speaker 1: Unions are at a height of power right now, because even if the industry wants to go entirely to unscripted content to avoid the consequences of this strike, the one movie that gets made with real writers will be the only good movie that year eventually.

410
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:59,000
Speaker 0: If you look, there are still, right, this whole 2023 was all what the people went nuts for the Barbenheimer, neither which I saw.

411
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,660
Speaker 1: We're gonna go see Oppenheimer on Friday, I think.

412
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,454
Speaker 0: But they were both written, right?

413
00:27:03,494 --> 00:27:04,140
Speaker 0: Those are written.

414
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:09,090
Speaker 1: Do you want every show to be "All my balls are

415
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:09,712
Speaker 1: jackass?"?

416
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:12,040
Speaker 1: And even jackass had a script.

417
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,665
Speaker 0: I mean, I just do.

418
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:15,960
Speaker 0: I don't really watch TV, period, written or unwritten.

419
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:21,452
Speaker 1: And in some other news, this is actually breaking news today.

420
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,980
Speaker 1: I think the dateline is like a few hours ago.

421
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:38,020
Speaker 1: Basically, New York City passed a law and a bunch of requirements that gig workers doing deliveries had to be paid the same fucking New York minimum wage and couldn't be paid.

422
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,399
Speaker 0: The council passed that law a while ago.

423
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:50,560
Speaker 1: Yep, and there were huge lawsuits and basically Grubhub, Uber and DoorDash fought with terrifying amounts of money to block this.

424
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,299
Speaker 0: Oh, not Instacart wasn't in on that, too?

425
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:56,935
Speaker 1: Instacart was not listed in the article on CNBC that I'm looking at right now.

426
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:57,196
Speaker 1: I assume.

427
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,600
Speaker 0: Because as evil as those are, I always feel like Instacart is the worst one.

428
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,128
Speaker 1: Yeah, Instacart probably is the worst one.

429
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,200
Speaker 1: Well, Uber might actually be the worst one.

430
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,857
Speaker 0: They're real bad, too.

431
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:07,080
Speaker 0: Anyway.

432
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:08,700
Speaker 1: Anyway, they're all bad.

433
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:13,700
Speaker 1: Granted, I used Grubhub yesterday because they don't have a lot of options.

434
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, I used Grubhub.

435
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:15,747
Speaker 0: I don't use the other ones.

436
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:19,780
Speaker 0: Grubhub is evil, but just the slightest bit less evil than the other ones.

437
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:33,572
Speaker 1: Although, I got a quote here from this article where a Grubhub spokesperson called the decision disappointing, saying a statement that they're evaluating their next legal actions and basically said, "Well, we're going to change our whole platform now and fuck all of you.

438
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:34,917
Speaker 1: Everything's going to be worse

439
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:35,198
Speaker 1: now.".

440
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:36,759
Speaker 0: Alright, good luck.

441
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:42,860
Speaker 1: So, I bet what they're going to do is just turn the screws on the restaurants and raise their prices some terrifying amount.

442
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:51,560
Speaker 1: Anyway, so they all sued like crazy and did huge astroturfing and influence campaigns to try to block this.

443
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,584
Speaker 1: And in the end, they failed.

444
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:56,292
Speaker 1: The courts were like, "Nope, there is nothing wrong with this law.

445
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:58,859
Speaker 1: You're all idiots, and this is going to go into

446
00:28:58,899 --> 00:28:59,200
Speaker 1: effect.".

447
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:00,726
Speaker 1: And that's the end of it.

448
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:03,899
Speaker 1: Appeal to the Supreme Court if you really want to.

449
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:08,751
Speaker 0: So yeah, a law like this though, it's like this is what it's all about.

450
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:11,380
Speaker 0: Where it's like, hey, even if the company is super evil, right?

451
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:21,400
Speaker 0: It's like when the regulations are strong enough that companies really just can't cross a certain line of evil without breaking the law.

452
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,940
Speaker 1: They'll go right up to that line.

453
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,000
Speaker 0: Right.

454
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:27,188
Speaker 0: Then it's like you sort of, it sort of makes life easier.

455
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:31,658
Speaker 0: You don't have to like, you know, sort of pick and choose like, "Oh, is it okay for me to use this company?

456
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:32,079
Speaker 0: They're so

457
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:32,440
Speaker 0: evil.".

458
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:39,680
Speaker 0: It's like even the evilest company isn't, you know, can only be so much evil and you can sort of not have to worry about that so much.

459
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,179
Speaker 1: I think in the US, unless you're eating.

460
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,975
Speaker 0: Knowing that the person who's delivering your food is getting paid a fair amount, you know, it's like,

461
00:29:46,597 --> 00:29:46,918
Speaker 0: "Alright."

462
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:47,700
Speaker 0: Yep.

463
00:29:48,001 --> 00:30:05,020
Speaker 1: So it's going to rise on a schedule and then it'll hit $19.96 per hour, which is still, from my perspective on capital and human labor, $20 an hour for a real human's difficult effort is insulting and dangerous to society.

464
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:13,460
Speaker 0: So not only, right, so $20 an hour times 40 hours times 52 weeks a year is only $41,000.

465
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:21,920
Speaker 0: And not only, you know, it's like, yeah, $41,000 may be for someone who's doing something that's like super easy and safe and chill.

466
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:31,040
Speaker 1: No, these guys are riding e-bikes that are on the verge of exploding with bootleg batteries, sharing apartments, delivering food in New York City.

467
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,660
Speaker 0: In all kinds of weather, right, in all kinds of weather, snow, rain, whatever, it's like carrying shit.

468
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,751
Speaker 1: They're getting hit by cars all the time.

469
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:41,200
Speaker 1: Their bikes are getting stolen all the time.

470
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,749
Speaker 0: All day, at all weird hours, to your stupid ass house, right?

471
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,414
Speaker 0: It's like, that's underwater welding levels of danger.

472
00:30:48,454 --> 00:30:51,360
Speaker 0: It should be at least three times that much money.

473
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:51,681
Speaker 0: Yup.

474
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:59,680
Speaker 1: Now, of course, the common villain in everything we talked about today, except that really nice camera, is capitalism, and just make sure you internalize that.

475
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,364
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

476
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:17,000
Speaker 1: So, back at RIT, I remember, I don't remember if it was a bear or a gorilla, because after Scott mentioned that he thought it was a bear, I think I remember a bear.

477
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:17,960
Speaker 0: I don't remember either.

478
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:26,860
Speaker 1: But also, having gone down a deep rabbit hole of the current state of research in human cognition, I learned something about memory.

479
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:34,820
Speaker 1: So, humans don't actually, we don't remember details very well, except in very certain circumstances.

480
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:52,340
Speaker 1: And the going theory is that if we try to remember something, especially from a long time ago, our brain will remember specific pieces of information, and then it will go through your other memories to basically fill in all the details with what is the most plausible.

481
00:31:53,020 --> 00:32:04,520
Speaker 1: So, like, you might have a memory of eating at a restaurant when you were a kid, and you'll remember a few specific things, but if you think back and recall it, your brain might insert very vivid components of that memory.

482
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:08,999
Speaker 1: That are basically compiled from other memories as a best guess.

483
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:17,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm surprised to hear you admit to this, because very often I say, "Oh, I remember this, but I'm not so

484
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:18,115
Speaker 0: sure.".

485
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:19,718
Speaker 0: And you're like, "No, it's definitely...".

486
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:26,300
Speaker 0: You just guarantee, you're so sure that you're right about things that you remember.

487
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:36,179
Speaker 1: I am 100% sure that you and I used to run up that right side of that Counter-Strike map all the time, that it was like a thing we would do.

488
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,420
Speaker 0: Well, you didn't remember the rules to match at the gathering.

489
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:44,179
Speaker 1: Either that, or everyone in my middle school got that one rule wrong, and it didn't matter.

490
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,844
Speaker 0: Either one.

491
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,380
Speaker 0: You're either wrong then, or you're wrong now, or both.

492
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:48,821
Speaker 0: Yep.

493
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:50,585
Speaker 1: So anyway, we saw this video.

494
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:53,372
Speaker 1: You've probably seen a video like this, too.

495
00:32:53,392 --> 00:32:56,620
Speaker 1: A lot of teachers show it in school, where they give you a task.

496
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,346
Speaker 1: Like, "Hey, here's a bunch of kids playing basketball.

497
00:32:58,587 --> 00:32:59,972
Speaker 1: Count how many times the basketball gets

498
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:00,413
Speaker 1: passed.".

499
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:02,260
Speaker 1: And you do it, and it feels really easy.

500
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,649
Speaker 1: And then the teacher's like, "So, who saw the

501
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:05,171
Speaker 1: gorilla?".

502
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:06,416
Speaker 1: And everyone in the room goes,

503
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:07,079
Speaker 1: "What?".

504
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:12,765
Speaker 1: And then they play the video again, and there's clearly a gorilla, like, in the-- Not even hiding.

505
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:15,037
Speaker 0: Just right fucking there, dancing, waving.

506
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:21,959
Speaker 1: It's like waving its hands, and when we saw this at RIT, we were like, "There's no

507
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:22,200
Speaker 1: way!".

508
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,960
Speaker 1: And we go back and watch the actual, original video, and it's there, and it was kind of an amazing demonstration.

509
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:29,079
Speaker 1: Yep.

510
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,822
Speaker 1: Like, it worked.

511
00:33:30,304 --> 00:33:31,490
Speaker 1: And never thought about it again.

512
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,439
Speaker 0: SciShow, eight days ago-- I thought about it maybe a couple times again.

513
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:35,800
Speaker 1: Yeah.

514
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:42,880
Speaker 1: But SciShow uploaded a video eight days ago, what that famous gorilla suit study didn't see.

515
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:54,100
Speaker 1: And basically, that study, the original study where people made the videos based on it, opened a whole fucking can of worms on human cognition.

516
00:33:54,541 --> 00:34:02,660
Speaker 1: And there have been huge advances and major updates to science based on the continued follow-ups from that study.

517
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:09,639
Speaker 1: And this video is a summary of all the crazy nonsense we have learned since then about why we don't see the gorilla.

518
00:34:10,062 --> 00:34:15,139
Speaker 1: There's a lot to unpack, and this is an eight minute summary of some really interesting things about humans.

519
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:17,378
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

520
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,569
Speaker 0: So, since I did a photo news, I'll do a photo thing of the day.

521
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:25,120
Speaker 0: I found this YouTube channel, because everything in the day is a YouTube channel these days.

522
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,540
Speaker 0: There's this guy named Paulie B. How could you not love a guy named Paulie B who's in New York, right?

523
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,780
Speaker 0: I don't know that he's from New York, but he's living in New York, at least, as far as I can tell from his YouTube channel.

524
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:46,000
Speaker 0: And there is YouTube, if you haven't searched for photo stuff on YouTube, YouTube has way too much photo stuff, because cameras are how you make YouTube.

525
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,679
Speaker 0: So of course, camera people are all over YouTube, right?

526
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:56,719
Speaker 0: But once YouTube knows you want to watch photo related content, you will be buried.

527
00:34:57,382 --> 00:35:02,720
Speaker 0: Most of that content, as I discussed in the news, is about camera equipment, right?

528
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:12,620
Speaker 0: Camera people discussing camera equipment, not all of its bad content, but like when I said, oh yeah, all the camera review people got Nikon ZF preview models, right?

529
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,854
Speaker 0: And those are the only people who've had them, right?

530
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:15,780
Speaker 0: Because it's not out yet.

531
00:35:16,441 --> 00:35:23,660
Speaker 0: Go look on YouTube and see how many people have Nikon ZFs in their video that they're holding there.

532
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:25,840
Speaker 0: It's a lot, right?

533
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:31,720
Speaker 0: There are so many people who only just like review camera shit on YouTube.

534
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:39,620
Speaker 1: And it's the same thing as you try to look for tech stuff, and it's just people talking about computer equipment and nothing about what to use that equipment for.

535
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,382
Speaker 0: Exactly.

536
00:35:41,582 --> 00:35:51,120
Speaker 0: And Paulie B, right, is the rare example of someone who's actually talking about, you know, it's like he might ask someone once, like hey, what camera you got there?

537
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:52,740
Speaker 0: And then that's the end of it, right?

538
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:54,645
Speaker 0: He's not judging them.

539
00:35:54,665 --> 00:35:55,829
Speaker 0: He's not reviewing them.

540
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:59,700
Speaker 0: It's like they are talking about, you know, the art of taking photos.

541
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,208
Speaker 0: Mostly he's doing street photos, but you know, he's interviewing people.

542
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:11,280
Speaker 0: He does a show, Walkie Talkie, where basically one person is a street photographer who's, you know, a professional.

543
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:15,339
Speaker 0: And they walk around taking photos, and he just walks with them and talks to them.

544
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,019
Speaker 1: That's a real good format right there.

545
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,964
Speaker 0: And shows you what their work looks like.

546
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,669
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, it's like.

547
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,513
Speaker 0: this is the real content.

548
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:26,720
Speaker 0: if you're, you know, an artist or creative person, right?

549
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:33,140
Speaker 0: Where you're not, it's not about the equipment or the technique so much or the technology.

550
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:37,091
Speaker 0: It's like it's about the people, you know, the creative people.

551
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:40,080
Speaker 0: You can learn from them and what they're doing, right?

552
00:36:40,621 --> 00:36:55,320
Speaker 0: And there are not enough YouTube channels like this one, and I wish that the algorithm that, you know, if it was not capitalist, right, and about trying to sell things, it would rank this kind of content higher, right, than, you know, the other kind.

553
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,195
Speaker 0: But it doesn't, so you have to find it from a thing of the day.

554
00:36:58,437 --> 00:36:58,960
Speaker 0: So now you did.

555
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:11,920
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the GeekNuts Book Club book, which we will do the show on a week or two after the upcoming Murderbot book comes out, because I am now a third of the way through the fifth Murderbot.

556
00:37:12,921 --> 00:37:14,880
Speaker 0: Let me just check the date on that while you're talking.

557
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,281
Speaker 1: Yep.

558
00:37:15,562 --> 00:37:17,767
Speaker 1: But the Murderbot Diaries, that is the book club book.

559
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:23,280
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about all of the Murderbot Diaries that have been released hitherto when we do the show.

560
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:35,420
Speaker 1: And if you're a listener of this podcast, I am hard pressed to think of the person who likes Geek Nights, but would not at least enjoy some aspect of the Murderbot Diaries.

561
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:36,482
Speaker 0: All right.

562
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:36,923
Speaker 0: Here you go.

563
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:40,489
Speaker 0: Book seven comes out November 14th.

564
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:46,980
Speaker 0: It follows the events in network effect, which is book one, two, five.

565
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:47,921
Speaker 1: Yep.

566
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:50,187
Speaker 1: That's the one with.

567
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:52,112
Speaker 1: that's the one with all the.

568
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:53,235
Speaker 1: well, anyway, no spoilers.

569
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:54,759
Speaker 1: I'm reading that one right now.

570
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:56,022
Speaker 0: Yeah.

571
00:37:56,042 --> 00:38:00,174
Speaker 0: So immediately following book five is books is book seven.

572
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,460
Speaker 0: So if you didn't know, the books don't come in chronological order.

573
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:06,191
Speaker 0: You know, book six doesn't happen.

574
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:08,360
Speaker 0: You know, whatever you get the idea.

575
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,460
Speaker 1: I'm reading them in publication order because I don't I'm not going to play.

576
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,101
Speaker 0: I'm also.

577
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:23,380
Speaker 0: I also read them in publication order, but I'm just saying chronologically book six happens, I think, before book five and book seven happens immediately after book.

578
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:24,983
Speaker 0: Five.

579
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:27,579
Speaker 0: I can't keep track of it.

580
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:38,480
Speaker 1: Anyway, Murderbot Diaries, big alien, aliens, world type vibes, but possibly before it gets as dystopian as that world, but not that much before possibly.

581
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,963
Speaker 1: Anyway, they're good books.

582
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:40,645
Speaker 1: I'm enjoying them.

583
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:41,988
Speaker 1: Definitely can do a show on.

584
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:47,120
Speaker 0: the Iliad translated by Emily Wilson is now available.

585
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:52,940
Speaker 0: I'm in, I think, 16th place in the queue at the library to get a copy.

586
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,180
Speaker 0: I just agree right now after we do the murder about how many copies they have.

587
00:38:58,321 --> 00:39:01,219
Speaker 0: But if they only have one, that means I can have to wait over a year.

588
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:11,099
Speaker 1: So let's agree that after the murder about show at whenever we both have a copy of the Iliad to read, I'm just going to probably cancel my library reserve and buy it for 20 bucks.

589
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,074
Speaker 1: But once we do that, we're going to pause the book club to do a book club episode on that.

590
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,180
Speaker 1: It doesn't count as your choice or my choice.

591
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:19,511
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to do that?

592
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,159
Speaker 0: I figured we could.

593
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:26,580
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's no universe where I don't read that book basically as fast as possible once I sit down with a copy of it.

594
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,369
Speaker 0: I think it's going to be a lot.

595
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:28,179
Speaker 0: I think it's long, though.

596
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,933
Speaker 1: I feel like I can read it pretty quick.

597
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,398
Speaker 1: I read that Odyssey pretty quick.

598
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:35,700
Speaker 0: Like a lamnod.

599
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:44,920
Speaker 1: Well, that's going to be the stinger at the end of the show, because that's looping in my head right now, including the video that I remember in more detail than I should.

600
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,920
Speaker 1: The little googly eyes of the lamb shop.

601
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,919
Speaker 0: I remember that video perfectly.

602
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,926
Speaker 1: Because I remember watching that video.

603
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:51,854
Speaker 1: All I could think the whole time is, is that Ra?

604
00:39:52,135 --> 00:39:53,180
Speaker 1: I hope he washed his hands.

605
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,381
Speaker 0: Yeah.

606
00:39:54,401 --> 00:40:04,280
Speaker 0: So the final meta moment is that maybe next weekend, the seventh and eighth, we can attempt to launch the Geek Knights website, maybe?

607
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:05,579
Speaker 1: Exciting times.

608
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:06,716
Speaker 0: We'll see.

609
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,640
Speaker 1: Say goodbye to the Web 2.0 version of the Geek Knights website.

610
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:13,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

611
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:15,123
Speaker 1: We're going back.

612
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,829
Speaker 1: Actually, I'd say the new website.

613
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:19,900
Speaker 1: We're going back to a Web 1.0 type of experience on purpose.

614
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:25,440
Speaker 0: I mean, it doesn't look like a GeoCities website, but it's like it's pretty much just HTML, CSS.

615
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,242
Speaker 0: We got rid of.

616
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:30,254
Speaker 0: I think there's maybe one JavaScript that's small.

617
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:32,100
Speaker 0: And if you turn off JavaScript, you won't even notice.

618
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,499
Speaker 1: We're going back to the intent of the World Wide Web.

619
00:40:35,322 --> 00:40:35,706
Speaker 0: Yeah.

620
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:36,778
Speaker 0: So, you know.

621
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:38,462
Speaker 1: All right.

622
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:39,284
Speaker 1: Let's get right into it.

623
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:45,800
Speaker 1: Partly because we've gone a little long, which happens when we do shows in weird order, skip episodes recently.

624
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:50,040
Speaker 1: Anyway, we went to a concert and...

625
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:54,420
Speaker 0: So I knew the concert was coming and bought tickets way in advance.

626
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:54,690
Speaker 0: Yep.

627
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:55,662
Speaker 0: Right.

628
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:58,060
Speaker 0: And like the day they went on sale, basically.

629
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,513
Speaker 1: And when you did that, at the time, I had a tentative work trip where there was a chance.

630
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:04,840
Speaker 1: I was going to be in like Asia for three weeks.

631
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:06,244
Speaker 1: So there was.

632
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:08,658
Speaker 1: I wasn't sure if I could go and there's a good chance I couldn't.

633
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:16,000
Speaker 1: So I just filed it away as I'll get tickets if it's not sold out when I know if I have to go on this work trip.

634
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:17,279
Speaker 1: And then I just immediately forgot.

635
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,700
Speaker 0: So the day before the concert, I just go and I look and I'm like, oh, why is this show not sold out?

636
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,200
Speaker 0: And I'm like, I'm just like, hey, anyone, you know, I'm going to the show tomorrow.

637
00:41:27,348 --> 00:41:27,539
Speaker 1: Yeah.

638
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:30,419
Speaker 0: It's not sold out if anyone else wants to go.

639
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,320
Speaker 0: You know, hey.

640
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:32,800
Speaker 1: Yeah.

641
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,440
Speaker 1: So our friend Kat went with with another friend, Carl.

642
00:41:36,281 --> 00:41:38,912
Speaker 1: And I was while we were doing geek nights because I was.

643
00:41:38,972 --> 00:41:40,980
Speaker 1: I was thinking about this while wrapping up the show.

644
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:46,480
Speaker 1: You might have seen me get a little distracted because I go and I start poking around a ticket master like, let's see what kind of tickets I can get.

645
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:51,140
Speaker 1: And I see a scattered seats in the upper mezzanines that aren't sold.

646
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:56,980
Speaker 1: And I see four seats in the orchestra pit right fucking next to the stage that are not sold.

647
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:58,059
Speaker 1: So I click on this.

648
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:01,709
Speaker 0: What is I think I never even clicked on those because like I just like.

649
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:04,817
Speaker 0: I don't because like I would never click on those first five hundred dollars.

650
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,559
Speaker 1: I clicked on the cheap seats and they were like 80 bucks.

651
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,200
Speaker 1: And then I thought for a second.

652
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:11,980
Speaker 1: So I thought, OK, I can get some tickets.

653
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:14,740
Speaker 1: And then I thought, how much would it be to get the crazy ticket?

654
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,399
Speaker 1: I'm expecting to see some stupid number.

655
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:21,980
Speaker 1: So I click on the mezzanine and it says one hundred and eighty bucks, which one hundred dollars is a lot more.

656
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:29,780
Speaker 1: But that is like upgrading from shit coach to regular coach is more than that on an airline for one flight.

657
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:34,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like hockey games are well, that's like the price of like.

658
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:40,160
Speaker 0: the best hockey game is one hundred eighty bucks and the non playoff, at least at the Madison Square Garden.

659
00:42:40,822 --> 00:42:43,020
Speaker 0: So if you go somewhere else, that'll be several hockey.

660
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:52,200
Speaker 1: So if you watch the nice episode a few nights ago, you will see me like ignore Scott for like 90 seconds while I frantically buy two of those tickets before they disappear because that's.

661
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:04,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I paid like, you know, one hundred and just change right to get like pretty close to the front of the first mezzanine because it's maybe 14 feet away from us and came right.

662
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,639
Speaker 1: Or like came down next to us to shake hands with a bunch of people.

663
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:13,980
Speaker 0: It's like if I would have known, it's like I just didn't look closely because it's just, you know, I just like, oh, buy the reasonable ticket.

664
00:43:14,402 --> 00:43:16,436
Speaker 0: I'll just click on a reasonable area, buy a ticket.

665
00:43:16,476 --> 00:43:16,980
Speaker 0: Who cares?

666
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,726
Speaker 0: I didn't even think to explore.

667
00:43:18,786 --> 00:43:22,260
Speaker 0: But of course, when I after you said you got the close up seats, I'm like, what the fuck?

668
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,752
Speaker 0: And I look at the price range was just eighty to one eighty.

669
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:27,880
Speaker 0: I'm like, that is a fucking narrow range.

670
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:28,681
Speaker 1: Right.

671
00:43:28,721 --> 00:43:34,940
Speaker 0: Radio City Music Hall, usually out you expect a range of like forty to five hundred dollars to five hundred dollars.

672
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:45,416
Speaker 1: Two times in my life I have had tickets with seats in what I would consider the extremely good, like ridiculous.

673
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,900
Speaker 1: you would never sit here normally plays three times.

674
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,000
Speaker 1: Once we sat front row at a playoff Red Wings game when I was a kid because my dad got some tickets.

675
00:43:53,901 --> 00:44:03,140
Speaker 1: Once we were in the I think second row or third row when Patrick Stewart's Macbeth, like that crazy one, like we saw that we that was a lot of money, but we saw that.

676
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:04,805
Speaker 1: And third was this concert.

677
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:09,079
Speaker 0: I mean, I've been in luxury boxes, I guess that didn't pay for it.

678
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,580
Speaker 0: That's not front row, but that's the same level of, you know.

679
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess even then I you know, it was a concert.

680
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:21,740
Speaker 1: So I expected like I expected these seats to be great, but I also didn't expect it to be like that much different sitting somewhere else.

681
00:44:22,321 --> 00:44:26,600
Speaker 0: But having actually been up in the mezzanine, it was perfectly fantastic.

682
00:44:27,841 --> 00:44:34,520
Speaker 1: But like it was it was an experience to sit that close and see every little detail of all those dancers and all that nonsense on stage.

683
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:42,220
Speaker 1: Also, the thing I learned about that orchestra pit that I'll talk about at the end because it's not relevant to the concert was kind of amazing.

684
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,400
Speaker 0: So I mean, Janelle Monae is someone I've been a fan of since like at least since I lived in Beacon.

685
00:44:48,441 --> 00:44:52,052
Speaker 0: But hasn't released, you know, albums that frequently.

686
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:54,940
Speaker 0: There was like a big gap of like I want to say it a few years.

687
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,647
Speaker 1: Like Dirty Computer was like what?

688
00:44:56,647 --> 00:44:56,707
Speaker 1: 2017, 2018.

689
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:58,575
Speaker 1: Like it was a while.

690
00:44:58,635 --> 00:44:59,740
Speaker 1: It was pre-Covid.

691
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,669
Speaker 0: Something like that.

692
00:45:00,689 --> 00:45:01,360
Speaker 0: I don't remember the exact year.

693
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:02,312
Speaker 1: There it is.

694
00:45:02,312 --> 00:45:02,920
Speaker 1: 2018, Dirty Computer.

695
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,040
Speaker 0: Right.

696
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,289
Speaker 0: And so then, you know, Age of Pleasure was this year.

697
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:09,200
Speaker 0: So it's a five year, four or five year gap between albums.

698
00:45:10,182 --> 00:45:10,503
Speaker 0: Right.

699
00:45:10,884 --> 00:45:14,958
Speaker 0: You know, but she was doing other things like acting and, you know, still, you know, business.

700
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:15,420
Speaker 0: Right.

701
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:19,557
Speaker 0: And it's like it's one of those people where it's like, I'm a fan of them.

702
00:45:19,979 --> 00:45:20,160
Speaker 0: Right.

703
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:22,807
Speaker 0: They're crazy awesome and talented.

704
00:45:22,907 --> 00:45:27,740
Speaker 0: And, you know, I like everything about them, but I'm not like, you know, focused on them.

705
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,381
Speaker 0: Right.

706
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:31,590
Speaker 0: I'm not like number one fan obsessed with them.

707
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:32,051
Speaker 0: Right.

708
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:34,980
Speaker 0: The way like people are obsessed with Taylor Swift.

709
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,203
Speaker 0: I don't think I'm like that.

710
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:36,744
Speaker 0: Yes.

711
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,350
Speaker 0: Or the Beatles or.

712
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,560
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm like that with literally anything or anyone.

713
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:43,642
Speaker 0: I guess not.

714
00:45:44,383 --> 00:45:52,500
Speaker 0: But it's just like one of the artists that I greatly enjoy and I recognize as a unique and amazing, talented person.

715
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,170
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, why wouldn't I go see them?

716
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,652
Speaker 0: Look at that.

717
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:57,800
Speaker 1: Especially because we both kind of broke the seal.

718
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,900
Speaker 0: Especially if I'm not going to get another chance, if you don't release another album and go on tour again for five years.

719
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,815
Speaker 1: Plus, after three years of isolation and starting to come back out of that.

720
00:46:05,935 --> 00:46:06,960
Speaker 0: I think we'll get more chances.

721
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,740
Speaker 1: She's not old, but I think we both started prioritizing experiences like that.

722
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,590
Speaker 1: Like that is the most important thing is to experience things.

723
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:18,460
Speaker 1: And we both started going to a bunch of concerts recently.

724
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:20,646
Speaker 1: And yeah, live music is just amazing.

725
00:46:20,706 --> 00:46:25,320
Speaker 1: Like go to concerts, go see live music, even if it's like low tier local stuff.

726
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:27,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, so it's like.

727
00:46:28,689 --> 00:46:31,420
Speaker 0: but the question is, I'm like, why didn't this sell out?

728
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,385
Speaker 0: Like she is insanely popular.

729
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:35,972
Speaker 1: And it was a crazy good show.

730
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:36,775
Speaker 0: Right.

731
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,720
Speaker 0: I'm like, why is this not sold out?

732
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:47,340
Speaker 0: And the only thing that I can think is like, the only explanation is either A, she's less popular than I thought, which doesn't make a lot of sense.

733
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,782
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

734
00:46:48,822 --> 00:46:51,688
Speaker 0: It's like everyone I know knows who that is.

735
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:58,320
Speaker 0: Or B, is it that a lot of people have the same attitude that I have?

736
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:07,420
Speaker 0: Where it's like, yeah, you know, they're not like so focused on her that they're like number one fans, like noticing that she's on tour following her.

737
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,788
Speaker 0: Or there's a third theory.

738
00:47:09,808 --> 00:47:10,811
Speaker 1: I have two.

739
00:47:10,852 --> 00:47:12,156
Speaker 1: There's a fourth theory, possibly, too.

740
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,080
Speaker 1: Let's see what your third one is.

741
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,060
Speaker 0: My third theory is that she's also got a stop in Brooklyn, which divided up the New York crowd.

742
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:24,560
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, the girl who was sitting with us in the pit wanted to go see her in Brooklyn and it was sold out and got Radio City instead.

743
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:31,660
Speaker 1: So the people we hung out with in the pit also bought those tickets right before for nothing.

744
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,207
Speaker 1: And they were also like, I can't believe we got these seats.

745
00:47:34,508 --> 00:47:38,120
Speaker 1: But she was like a superfan and she was losing her shit.

746
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,007
Speaker 0: So there are people who are superfans.

747
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,995
Speaker 1: But she got the ticket for 180 bucks.

748
00:47:42,878 --> 00:47:43,420
Speaker 0: I know, right?

749
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:48,560
Speaker 1: Only because Brooklyn was sold out and she, like the day before, the same day after the ticket.

750
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,554
Speaker 0: I guess people feel like the Brooklyn show is gonna be better, but actually I'd rather go.

751
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:54,260
Speaker 0: Radio City is, you know, it's big.

752
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,789
Speaker 0: People don't know, Radio City Music Hall is indoors.

753
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:58,651
Speaker 0: It's not an arena.

754
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:00,336
Speaker 0: But it is big.

755
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:01,720
Speaker 0: It has a lot of seats.

756
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,814
Speaker 0: It is bigger than the Opera House at Met, I'm pretty sure.

757
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:07,400
Speaker 0: At least it feels bigger.

758
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:15,340
Speaker 1: According to Wikipedia, Radio City's four-tiered auditorium was the world's largest auditorium when it was opened.

759
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:17,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's an auditorium, right?

760
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:20,620
Speaker 0: But it's, you know, whereas the Brooklyn show is a Barclays, right?

761
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:21,846
Speaker 1: I don't know.

762
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:23,920
Speaker 1: I assume so, but I don't actually know.

763
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,403
Speaker 0: But that's an arena, right?

764
00:48:25,463 --> 00:48:32,137
Speaker 0: I would much rather go to even a very large auditorium than even a small arena, right?

765
00:48:32,197 --> 00:48:33,800
Speaker 0: For a musical performance.

766
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:36,893
Speaker 1: Also, Radio City's capacity is like 6,000 people.

767
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's big.

768
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:40,957
Speaker 1: And it's 90 years old.

769
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,340
Speaker 0: You really feel far away, even if you're far away, because of the shape of the place.

770
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was revolutionary in a bunch of ways that would be a distraction from the rest of the show.

771
00:48:50,420 --> 00:49:03,420
Speaker 1: But while we were there, because of the weird thing I learned about the orchestra pit after looking down that crack and then looking at Wikipedia and then reading a bunch of stuff, Radio City was like one of the most advanced auditoriums in the world when it was built.

772
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:06,040
Speaker 0: You used to be able to watch movies there.

773
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is still one of the best designed auditoriums in the world today.

774
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:16,474
Speaker 0: I mean, who's making a new big auditorium today to compete with it, right?

775
00:49:16,494 --> 00:49:19,040
Speaker 0: You could beat it easily with modern technology, but who is?

776
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:26,915
Speaker 0: Anyway, so go to the show and obviously my expectation for the show is high, right?

777
00:49:27,015 --> 00:49:29,360
Speaker 0: Because of the talent of the person.

778
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,072
Speaker 0: And I have basically zero doubt of being disappointed.

779
00:49:33,153 --> 00:49:35,400
Speaker 0: Like, none whatsoever, right?

780
00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:39,391
Speaker 0: You know, I know that basically it's like it's going to be lit.

781
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:41,359
Speaker 0: I know that's what it's going to be, right?

782
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:47,372
Speaker 0: And yet the rare the rarest thing that could possibly happen is me.

783
00:49:47,392 --> 00:49:50,800
Speaker 0: I almost never set a high expectation, right?

784
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,606
Speaker 0: I always almost always set a low expectation.

785
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:57,656
Speaker 0: I set a high one because I was so confident, right?

786
00:49:58,257 --> 00:49:59,480
Speaker 0: And yet it was exceeded.

787
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:02,880
Speaker 1: It was one of the best musical acts I've ever seen in person in my life.

788
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:13,260
Speaker 1: Now, granted, I haven't been to a huge number of concerts, let alone like the top tier ones, but it was a fucking show and there's so much going on in this show.

789
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:25,440
Speaker 1: The fact like it was the staging almost evoked like the history of music in terms of old reviews and the way the stage was set up with the staircase down the middle.

790
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,684
Speaker 1: It was super classy.

791
00:50:27,026 --> 00:50:31,080
Speaker 1: It crossed a variety of different genres, which the album does too.

792
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:33,184
Speaker 1: The stage setting was fantastic.

793
00:50:33,385 --> 00:50:35,329
Speaker 0: The stage set was like this big amp.

794
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:40,020
Speaker 0: It was like an amphitheater, but it was facing at us and we're in an auditorium facing at them.

795
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,507
Speaker 0: So it's like the performers, are they there?

796
00:50:43,008 --> 00:50:47,340
Speaker 0: They're there to see us right now as much as we are there to see them.

797
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:48,041
Speaker 0: Right.

798
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:51,691
Speaker 0: There's just all these layers of meaning going on.

799
00:50:51,971 --> 00:50:55,340
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, in terms of the types of performances, right?

800
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,052
Speaker 0: It's like several, you know, so many genres were crossed.

801
00:50:59,373 --> 00:51:01,460
Speaker 0: You know, she raps, she's singing.

802
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,086
Speaker 0: We got the jazzy ones.

803
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:05,477
Speaker 1: We got some old school R&B style songs.

804
00:51:05,537 --> 00:51:06,140
Speaker 1: We've got some.

805
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,126
Speaker 0: You got the sexy ones.

806
00:51:08,286 --> 00:51:09,270
Speaker 0: You got the chill one.

807
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,978
Speaker 0: It's like every single kind of everything is going on there.

808
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:12,400
Speaker 0: Right.

809
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,208
Speaker 0: Different types of dancing, different genres of dancing.

810
00:51:15,248 --> 00:51:16,572
Speaker 0: I knew there'd be a live band.

811
00:51:16,913 --> 00:51:17,194
Speaker 0: Right.

812
00:51:17,394 --> 00:51:19,200
Speaker 0: They come with a live horn section in there.

813
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,587
Speaker 0: I didn't know that was going to be in there.

814
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:29,160
Speaker 1: This was two saxophones, a trumpet, a trombone, and the trumpet was actually a trumpet.

815
00:51:29,802 --> 00:51:32,540
Speaker 0: I thought it was a trombone, a trumpet, and a sax.

816
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,170
Speaker 1: So when I said trumpet, that's what I was about to get to.

817
00:51:35,572 --> 00:51:37,620
Speaker 1: That was not actually a regular trumpet.

818
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:44,152
Speaker 1: That was either a flugelhorn or a flugelhorn adjacent device.

819
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:48,360
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of things that are like trumpets that are not actually trumpets.

820
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:51,890
Speaker 1: I really like playing flugelhorns and horns like them.

821
00:51:52,312 --> 00:51:53,616
Speaker 1: They have a very different timbre.

822
00:51:53,696 --> 00:51:55,020
Speaker 1: They feel very different to play.

823
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,845
Speaker 1: They're a different kind of instrument.

824
00:51:58,069 --> 00:52:01,960
Speaker 1: They're a more sophisticated instrument, shall we say, than a trumpet.

825
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,343
Speaker 1: They're more like a cornet.

826
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:09,300
Speaker 1: They were also very good at their music, those players.

827
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,706
Speaker 0: I could say this.

828
00:52:11,726 --> 00:52:17,780
Speaker 0: A lot of people joke that you go to a metal show or a rock show and you can't really hear the bass guitar.

829
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:32,720
Speaker 0: I think the bass guitar at this show, also because of the disco soul influence in a lot of the music, I heard it more than I heard it at any show in my life.

830
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,999
Speaker 0: And the person who was playing the bass was Sick AF.

831
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:52,740
Speaker 1: The sound mixing, and I think part of this was that it was Radio City, was phenomenal in that if you focused on any instrument on stage, you could hear it perfectly clearly at any point.

832
00:52:54,261 --> 00:53:03,100
Speaker 0: There were some sounds that were just recordings, but I don't know if they were coming from literally just a track playing, or just the keyboard was doing it.

833
00:53:03,828 --> 00:53:04,380
Speaker 1: Well that keyboard!

834
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,971
Speaker 0: It wasn't like 100% live, it was like 90% live.

835
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,660
Speaker 1: That keyboardist up there in that dress, she had a rack of like 8 keyboards that she was playing simultaneously.

836
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,880
Speaker 0: Well, you're playing such a wide variety of music, you're not getting it done with one.

837
00:53:19,123 --> 00:53:30,500
Speaker 1: But also the choreography stood out as being both extremely tight and well choreographed, but also very loose and fluid and improvisational on purpose.

838
00:53:30,801 --> 00:53:37,560
Speaker 1: And that stood out compared to how a lot of backup dancers work in this typical kind of choreographed stage show.

839
00:53:38,522 --> 00:53:47,800
Speaker 0: It wasn't like a K-Pop show where it was like everyone was in perfect sync all the time, but it also wasn't like a mess of people just doing whatever.

840
00:53:48,040 --> 00:54:01,020
Speaker 0: It's like they were doing the same dance together, they wouldn't win an award at the Olympics for synchronized swimming, but they all had the feel and emotion in their dancing was stronger.

841
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:16,800
Speaker 1: Well the performance I think was better for it, because if the theme of Age of Pleasure was around safe spaces to explore the unlimited resource of shared pleasure that humans have, which is kind of the theme of the album, you know, the album's really worth a listen.

842
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:23,020
Speaker 1: And if the concert was exploring that theme, everybody on stage looked like they were having a fun time.

843
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think everyone in the crowd is having a fun time.

844
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:41,000
Speaker 0: The other thing I really appreciated is that I think Led Zeppelin is a good example of a band which intentionally, I think they've said as much, when they perform live, they wanted to sound like the album.

845
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:43,504
Speaker 0: Only live, obviously.

846
00:54:43,925 --> 00:54:49,579
Speaker 0: They wanted to basically play what it is that you heard at home the way you heard it at home.

847
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,725
Speaker 0: And I guess that's a certain kind of philosophy, right?

848
00:54:53,765 --> 00:54:54,867
Speaker 0: It's like, whatever.

849
00:54:55,288 --> 00:55:02,260
Speaker 0: My philosophy is that if I'm going to a live show on purpose, it's like I can listen to the album at home.

850
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,286
Speaker 0: And it's like, yes, those are familiar songs.

851
00:55:05,326 --> 00:55:11,120
Speaker 0: There's pleasure in hearing and enjoying the familiar songs.

852
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:18,875
Speaker 0: Anytime a band tries to play their new song that no one knows, the crowd is not as excited as when you play the hit song.

853
00:55:18,935 --> 00:55:21,100
Speaker 0: That's true for every musician ever.

854
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,167
Speaker 0: So it's like, yes, play your hit songs.

855
00:55:26,608 --> 00:55:32,900
Speaker 0: But if it sounds exactly like the album, me, I feel like, why am I here?

856
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:41,229
Speaker 0: I love to hear a different rendition, a different take, a different ad-lib, a different solo at least.

857
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:45,855
Speaker 0: Do something to mix it up in some way, shape, or form.

858
00:55:46,316 --> 00:55:49,620
Speaker 0: that's not the same as just the album.

859
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:51,843
Speaker 0: And that's exactly what we got.

860
00:55:51,943 --> 00:55:54,326
Speaker 0: Pretty much every single fucking song.

861
00:55:55,007 --> 00:55:57,070
Speaker 0: You could tell it was the song.

862
00:55:57,371 --> 00:56:00,235
Speaker 0: The structure was usually intact.

863
00:56:00,455 --> 00:56:04,020
Speaker 0: The same verse, chorus pattern, the same lyrics, mostly.

864
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,943
Speaker 0: It was the same fucking songs.

865
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:12,875
Speaker 0: Every single different song up there was a different rendition, a different mix, a different something.

866
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,380
Speaker 0: Sometimes a different genre entirely.

867
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,723
Speaker 0: But the same song.

868
00:56:17,823 --> 00:56:18,464
Speaker 0: You knew the song.

869
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:18,965
Speaker 0: That was it.

870
00:56:19,186 --> 00:56:21,590
Speaker 0: It was from her album, but it doesn't sound like the album.

871
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:25,899
Speaker 0: So you're paying and getting something for your money.

872
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:32,194
Speaker 0: Not something that you could have stayed home and listened to on Spotify.

873
00:56:32,335 --> 00:56:34,180
Speaker 0: Unless they release, I guess, a DVD.

874
00:56:34,701 --> 00:56:43,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I wouldn't want to just listen to that rendition by itself because it was the whole experience of the whole show together and being in the middle of it.

875
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:46,140
Speaker 1: Like if I listened to the album, I'd want to listen to the album.

876
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:46,941
Speaker 0: Right.

877
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:56,774
Speaker 0: There are a lot of shows, I'd say, where you might even be better off just watching a video of the concert on a good stereo, obviously, and not going.

878
00:56:57,255 --> 00:57:00,940
Speaker 0: This one was one of those ones where, nope, being there was not the same.

879
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,727
Speaker 1: Especially being in the pit because it was just a dance party.

880
00:57:03,827 --> 00:57:04,670
Speaker 1: Everyone was just dancing.

881
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:07,196
Speaker 0: Everyone was dancing in the mezzanine too.

882
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:08,700
Speaker 0: Mezzanine was also a dance party.

883
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,544
Speaker 1: Well, there was a moment when they turned on all the lights to do the thing.

884
00:57:12,564 --> 00:57:20,051
Speaker 1: I turned around and it almost was shocking to remember that there's a whole fucking auditorium behind us.

885
00:57:20,151 --> 00:57:24,536
Speaker 1: I was actually kind of lost in the concert, which we're old and jaded and have seen a lot of things.

886
00:57:24,836 --> 00:57:28,760
Speaker 1: It is very rare that I get lost in a performance of something to that degree.

887
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:34,447
Speaker 0: I could see all the people because I was in the mezzanine.

888
00:57:35,148 --> 00:57:40,996
Speaker 0: Usually when there's chairs, just the presence of chairs, even though people can stand up.

889
00:57:41,797 --> 00:57:42,658
Speaker 0: First of all, we're old.

890
00:57:42,738 --> 00:57:43,900
Speaker 0: I did sit down sometimes.

891
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:51,172
Speaker 1: I sat down for a moment because the last time I stood for an entire concert was Perovselor and I was leaning on a balcony the whole time.

892
00:57:51,192 --> 00:57:53,395
Speaker 0: There were some breaks to sit down.

893
00:57:53,676 --> 00:57:56,320
Speaker 0: She changed clothes way more times than I thought she would.

894
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:03,350
Speaker 1: That was share level of professional costume change nonsense, which I am always here for.

895
00:58:04,892 --> 00:58:07,856
Speaker 0: Awesome costumes too.

896
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:08,397
Speaker 0: Big hats.

897
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,360
Speaker 0: We love a big hat.

898
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:20,131
Speaker 0: Despite the presence of chairs, which are the greatest hindrance to people standing up and getting excited, that didn't fucking stop anyone.

899
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:23,275
Speaker 0: Maybe that is why people are going to the Barclay show.

900
00:58:23,335 --> 00:58:27,200
Speaker 0: I imagine in the arena they'll be just standing GA in front.

901
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:34,674
Speaker 1: I also imagine that Radio City can't just remove those chairs.

902
00:58:34,694 --> 00:58:36,297
Speaker 0: You can't remove the chairs at Radio City.

903
00:58:36,357 --> 00:58:37,318
Speaker 0: Everything there is chairs.

904
00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:38,100
Speaker 0: It's an auditorium.

905
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,523
Speaker 1: One last thing that was noteworthy in this.

906
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:46,168
Speaker 1: We've got to talk about encores and the history of encores.

907
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:52,054
Speaker 1: In the oldest times, the encore was a surprise and it wasn't expected.

908
00:58:52,775 --> 00:58:56,619
Speaker 1: An encore would be a surprise and people would be like, "Oh fuck, the band is going to play another

909
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:56,920
Speaker 1: song.".

910
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:05,150
Speaker 1: But then it became almost a ritual where everyone knows the encore is coming and the band will pretend to leave the stage and then they'll come back.

911
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:06,352
Speaker 1: And that happened in this concert.

912
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:11,939
Speaker 1: But then, after that first false encore...

913
00:59:13,101 --> 00:59:14,083
Speaker 0: So there was an encore.

914
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:19,831
Speaker 0: The usual shtick where they act like the show is over, then they come back out.

915
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:23,076
Speaker 0: I've basically gotten to the point of so many shows...

916
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Speaker 1: Until the house lights come on, the concert is still going.

917
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:28,681
Speaker 0: Exactly.

918
00:59:28,721 --> 00:59:34,649
Speaker 0: The house lights... First of all, I know just because we always think about meta stuff, because that's how we think.

919
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:42,679
Speaker 0: The way deals work at venues is the contracts almost always say 11 o'clock, you're done.

920
00:59:42,739 --> 00:59:43,000
Speaker 0: That's it.

921
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:48,588
Speaker 0: We've got people working here at the concessions and the merch booth and the janitors.

922
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:51,913
Speaker 0: You've got to be done at 11 in your contract.

923
00:59:51,973 --> 00:59:53,676
Speaker 0: You can't go past 11.

924
00:59:53,676 --> 00:59:55,659
Speaker 0: Almost always, that's the time in the US.

925
00:59:57,721 --> 01:00:01,265
Speaker 0: So I'm looking at the clock, it's like 1059.

926
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:05,531
Speaker 0: And after that encore, the confetti guns go off.

927
01:00:05,951 --> 01:00:08,014
Speaker 0: And the house lights start to turn on.

928
01:00:08,795 --> 01:00:11,759
Speaker 0: And they start playing recorded music.

929
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:18,238
Speaker 1: This is the first time in my entire life I got tricked and didn't expect an encore.

930
01:00:18,258 --> 01:00:18,458
Speaker 1: That is...

931
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:27,191
Speaker 0: Before and after a concert, they're always just playing recorded music that someone picked out for whatever method.

932
01:00:27,592 --> 01:00:30,696
Speaker 0: The recorded music comes on, which is the go home music.

933
01:00:31,397 --> 01:00:33,320
Speaker 0: The house lights are on partially.

934
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,957
Speaker 1: I stood up and put my hoodie on and took my earplugs out.

935
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,440
Speaker 0: Both feet were in the aisle and my back was towards the stage.

936
01:00:40,801 --> 01:00:43,410
Speaker 1: I had literally, I had taken my second earplug out.

937
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:46,200
Speaker 0: Some other people had already gone into the lobby.

938
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:51,132
Speaker 1: Now, what then transpired was the best encore I've ever seen in my life.

939
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:52,836
Speaker 1: It went harder than you can imagine.

940
01:00:52,896 --> 01:00:54,440
Speaker 1: It's hard to describe, but...

941
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,041
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

942
01:00:55,162 --> 01:00:57,487
Speaker 0: when she came out, she said something like, "Fuck my

943
01:00:57,527 --> 01:00:58,750
Speaker 0: contract.".

944
01:00:59,512 --> 01:01:02,680
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure she got in trouble or had to pay a fine or something.

945
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:07,228
Speaker 1: But it went harder than... I find a video of it or something.

946
01:01:07,388 --> 01:01:12,357
Speaker 1: It was quite an encore and I just left my etymotics out for that.

947
01:01:12,777 --> 01:01:14,320
Speaker 1: I just let my ears accept it.

948
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:16,239
Speaker 0: Earplugs were necessary at the show.

949
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,683
Speaker 1: I took my earplugs out.

950
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:20,408
Speaker 1: I left them out when the second encore started.

951
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:25,839
Speaker 1: And then I didn't regret that and I'll accept whatever minor damage I took from that final...

952
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,869
Speaker 0: I probably took more damage watching R.R.

953
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:31,680
Speaker 0: in the theater with no earplugs to hold for three hours.

954
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:35,816
Speaker 1: I gotta go back to my old rule of, "I always bring my etymotics with me everywhere, just in

955
01:01:35,837 --> 01:01:36,057
Speaker 1: case.".

956
01:01:36,781 --> 01:01:37,727
Speaker 0: Yeah.

957
01:01:37,767 --> 01:01:40,118
Speaker 0: So, if you want to go to this tour... Go to it!

958
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,567
Speaker 0: It is not over.

959
01:01:42,553 --> 01:01:43,660
Speaker 0: Brooklyn is tonight.

960
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:45,526
Speaker 1: I think that one was sold out.

961
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:48,317
Speaker 1: They're gonna be in Atlanta, North Carolina, Nashville...

962
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,546
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly they're going down south.

963
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:54,140
Speaker 0: Texas, California, Arizona, Georgia, New Orleans.

964
01:01:55,901 --> 01:02:02,380
Speaker 0: If it's not sold out near you, until the middle of October, you should go to this show.

965
01:02:02,983 --> 01:02:03,979
Speaker 1: You absolutely should.

966
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,186
Speaker 1: Problem is, now I just want to do nothing but go to shows.

967
01:02:07,267 --> 01:02:11,600
Speaker 1: I see why there are people who just go to shows and that's kind of their whole hobby.

968
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,180
Speaker 0: I've been going to a lot of shows.

969
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:14,166
Speaker 1: As have we!

970
01:02:14,488 --> 01:02:15,494
Speaker 1: We're just going to different shows.

971
01:02:15,535 --> 01:02:16,340
Speaker 1: This is where we converge.

972
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,759
Speaker 1: Because you don't care about that electro swing stuff I'm into.

973
01:02:19,742 --> 01:02:21,340
Speaker 0: No, I don't need to go to electro swing shows.

974
01:02:27,231 --> 01:02:29,477
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

975
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:34,490

985
01:03:37,345 --> 01:03:38,470

986
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:44,091
Speaker 0: I am mighty Agamemnon.

987
01:03:44,412 --> 01:03:46,179
Speaker 0: I am tasty like a London.

988
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,370
Speaker 0: I sail to Troy with the navy.

989
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,519
Speaker 0: I taste great with spuds and gravy.

990
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,438
Speaker 0: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.

991
01:03:57,741 --> 01:04:00,211
Speaker 0: I command all of the archives.

992
01:04:00,312 --> 01:04:02,079
Speaker 0: Roughly up at guess mark five.

993
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,331
Speaker 0: All Achaeans, bow to me.

994
01:04:05,632 --> 01:04:07,280
Speaker 0: I am great with rosemary.

995
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:10,639
Speaker 0: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.

996
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:15,395
Speaker 0: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.

997
01:04:19,082 --> 01:04:21,512
Speaker 0: I command bad killer Achilles.

998
01:04:21,632 --> 01:04:23,479
Speaker 0: Why not half me with some peas?

999
01:04:24,421 --> 01:04:26,751
Speaker 0: I spill entrails of our Trojan foes.

1000
01:04:26,831 --> 01:04:28,779
Speaker 0: A nice with garlic, don't you know?

1001
01:04:29,702 --> 01:04:31,899
Speaker 0: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.

1002
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:37,198
Speaker 0: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.

1003
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:42,530
Speaker 0: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.
