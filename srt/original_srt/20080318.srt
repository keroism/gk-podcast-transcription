1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,426
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday March 18th.

2
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:12,389
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:15,217
Speaker 0: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:19,199
Speaker 0: We talk about Professor Layton and the Curious Village.

5
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,928
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:32,659
Speaker 1: You know you never really notice sometimes how?

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,537
Speaker 1: Bad something is until you get it replaced with a new one of that thing and then you go oh man How was I using that old thing for so long it didn't even work?

8
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:41,060
Speaker 0: Yeah?

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,863
Speaker 0: It's like you'll have.

10
00:00:41,883 --> 00:00:42,586
Speaker 0: I don't know like.

11
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:45,077
Speaker 0: I can't even think of something.

12
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:45,880
Speaker 1: cars a good example.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,080
Speaker 1: I mean you get really used to driving an old busted car.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,047
Speaker 1: Then you get a brand new car.

15
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:51,292
Speaker 1: you drive a brand new car.

16
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:51,573
Speaker 1: You're like.

17
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:52,617
Speaker 1: Oh wow new cars.

18
00:00:52,697 --> 00:00:56,920
Speaker 0: Go yeah It's like you that the quality of something is sort of relative.

19
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:57,482
Speaker 0: You know.

20
00:00:57,603 --> 00:01:03,940
Speaker 0: so like if you have a television, and you don't look at other televisions and your television works You just you know that you go.

21
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:04,598
Speaker 0: What's wrong with it?

22
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:11,140
Speaker 0: It's fun, then if someone brings in a new television and puts it next to your old one You're like wow my old TV is shitty.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,120
Speaker 0: But I didn't realize it because I didn't have a good one for comparison.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:21,833
Speaker 1: But yet at the same time like if you only if you like when at RIT we had a god-awful television oh it was god-awful good goddamn.

25
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:29,100
Speaker 1: this TV was from 1974 and I think we've talked about the TV, but I didn't say suffice to say I almost did but.

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,680
Speaker 1: But it was so awful, but we never noticed except every now.

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:47,698
Speaker 1: And then we'd look at another TV and like ah ah but then as long as we didn't see another TV after about a week We'd forget and then the old TV was just fine As long as we didn't look at a color test cuz we realized that red wasn't red and there was no green.

28
00:01:48,039 --> 00:02:00,379
Speaker 1: yeah But so the part of my car that was broken right the only part other than the fact that I still can't Imagine how I was missing a lug nut Like I was missing a lug nut.

29
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:04,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, well if you're not missing more than a few then you won't really notice.

30
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:05,676
Speaker 1: Where did it go?

31
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:06,740
Speaker 1: who took it?

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,442
Speaker 0: I have not.

33
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:10,518
Speaker 0: maybe the last time a tire came on or off it just you know.

34
00:02:11,322 --> 00:02:15,296
Speaker 1: But the last time I took a tire off I took it off and I put the tire back on.

35
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:16,079
Speaker 0: maybe you forgot it.

36
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:17,426
Speaker 1: Can't forget a lug nut.

37
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:17,969
Speaker 1: cuz you look at it.

38
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:18,431
Speaker 1: You go wow.

39
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,315
Speaker 1: There's a lug nut miss.

40
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:20,200
Speaker 1: There's only five of them.

41
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:21,989
Speaker 1: They're big anyway.

42
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,872
Speaker 0: Well if they get loose also You know as you drive they could you know spin off.

43
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:26,314
Speaker 0: you got there.

44
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:31,016
Speaker 0: if they're not on there super tight And you keep driving and driving and driving it's gonna come off of there.

45
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:33,006
Speaker 1: the other thing is Where'd it go?

46
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,039
Speaker 1: because it was behind my hubcap?

47
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

48
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:40,440
Speaker 0: maybe when they took the hubcap off it sort of fell to the ground.

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,042
Speaker 0: They didn't notice.

50
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,407
Speaker 1: Maybe someone stole.

51
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:43,932
Speaker 1: They they took my hubcap off.

52
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:46,059
Speaker 1: They stole a lug nut to make a crack pipe.

53
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:49,767
Speaker 0: Not does not make a crack pipe make.

54
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,759
Speaker 1: I still can't figure out how you'd make a serviceable crack pipe out of them.

55
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,350
Speaker 0: Anyway, the spark plug spark plug.

56
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:57,916
Speaker 1: Yeah, I kid what.

57
00:02:57,956 --> 00:02:58,800
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's a website.

58
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,613
Speaker 0: Let's see how to make crack pie.

59
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:03,000
Speaker 0: I'm actually typing this in from.

60
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:07,665
Speaker 1: That's like what badgers eat Crack pipes.

61
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:10,218
Speaker 0: the idea is to cover my motorcycle with crack pipes.

62
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:10,480
Speaker 0: what?

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,507
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't know.

64
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:13,898
Speaker 0: What's up with that?

65
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:20,457
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the only thing that was actually wrong with my car was that the thing that controls the headlights.

66
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:26,781
Speaker 1: now actually It's only one thing that controls the headlights the hazard lights the turning lights the brights Everything.

67
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:31,220
Speaker 0: it's a stick with a bunch of switches on it and inside is all that like it's modular.

68
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,220
Speaker 1: I didn't really realize how it all worked, but they had to replace it and you couldn't get one from salvage.

69
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:38,727
Speaker 1: so I got a new one and It's so nice.

70
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:45,229
Speaker 1: Like I was turning my lights on and off all the way home It's silent - it doesn't make any noise.

71
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,480
Speaker 1: when I like move it doesn't click it's solid.

72
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:51,019
Speaker 1: It was so nice and they gave me the old one.

73
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:59,499
Speaker 1: So I learned that because this new one cost a hundred and sixty dollars I'm gonna open up the old one and fix it then sell it on eBay or something.

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,352
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I could probably sell it for at least 80 bucks.

75
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:03,900
Speaker 0: How would you know if it was working?

76
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:06,347
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty obvious.

77
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,491
Speaker 1: if you'll I can show it to you.

78
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,455
Speaker 1: It's in my car right now.

79
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:11,324
Speaker 1: You'll be like, oh duh All right, whatever.

80
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:15,000
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's that's the most exciting thing that happened to me today.

81
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:25,167
Speaker 0: No, it's funny that your your thing that happened to you today involves cars because last weekend, you know the weekend of March 14 15 16 etc.

82
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,043
Speaker 0: was was a special weekend for cars in 2008.

83
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:34,299
Speaker 0: It is the weekend of the Australian Grand Prix the first Grand Prix of the year.

84
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:40,738
Speaker 0: So today I have two news is involving cars and a thing of the day involving cars.

85
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:43,105
Speaker 0: All right All right See how many go for these newses.

86
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:43,809
Speaker 1: go for it.

87
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:50,177
Speaker 1: my interest in f1 and racing in general Waxton Wayne and wax and Wayne and it's real Wayne right now.

88
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:54,255
Speaker 0: anyway Gran Turismo 5 is coming or great.

89
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:57,880
Speaker 1: All right I got to say one thing before you continue because I don't know what you're gonna say.

90
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:05,340
Speaker 1: But regardless of how the game plays I'm not one to say all graphics make a game but that game looks freaking amazing.

91
00:05:05,782 --> 00:05:07,890
Speaker 0: I was about to say I'm not.

92
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,540
Speaker 0: you know, I do not buy games based on graphics.

93
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,699
Speaker 0: I don't judge games based on graphics.

94
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,140
Speaker 1: Well beyond the obvious limit of I can't tell if that's Mario or a smudge on the TV, right?

95
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,468
Speaker 0: but you look at the screenshots and videos of Gran Turismo 5 and I Thought it was just race footage or like the open.

96
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:27,772
Speaker 0: know that it's actually.

97
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:29,115
Speaker 0: that's what the game looks like.

98
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:30,178
Speaker 0: good God,

99
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:48,620
Speaker 1: you know I've wanted a realistic racing game pretty much for as long as I've known that there were cars Like seriously and the thing that always stops me is that even the realistic ones Like Gran Turismo most people play them with like an Xbox controller and that's not gonna do it for me.

100
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,849
Speaker 1: That's the point of realism if I get an analog stick.

101
00:05:51,171 --> 00:06:05,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really have a hard time playing these games In general, like I like the idea of like Gran Turismo, but actually trying to play it I always just spin out and crash because there's you know But in the arcade and when I got the wheel and the pedals I rock and roll.

102
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:13,466
Speaker 0: So anyway, I'm not exactly sure what the deal is because act there's a game called Gran Turismo 5 prologue coming out And it's not just like a demo.

103
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:19,418
Speaker 0: It's actually a game you pay for and it's got over a million pre-orders in Europe already, it's crazy.

104
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,324
Speaker 0: But I don't know.

105
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:27,973
Speaker 0: is Gran Turismo 5 gonna come later, I don't know some game journalists we are yeah But I can't really figure it out.

106
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,221
Speaker 0: I tried to figure it out I can't.

107
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:35,663
Speaker 0: what I do was able to figure out is that Gran Turismo 5 is Going to have.

108
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:42,903
Speaker 0: one of the cars available is going to be the 2007, you know f1 Ferrari Huh?

109
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,137
Speaker 0: This is being called God mode.

110
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,700
Speaker 0: I stole that from Kotaku, but whatever it's funny.

111
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,090
Speaker 0: Yes, yes, that's all I got to say about that.

112
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:10,217
Speaker 0: now my other racing news which is something we can actually talk about Mario Kart for the Wii is gonna be out in like a month or so, which is too soon too soon.

113
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,626
Speaker 0: You just put out Smash Brothers.

114
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:16,340
Speaker 1: I mean, I haven't even gotten to the second tier of goodness at Brawl.

115
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,800
Speaker 0: I know people complain that Nintendo will release a game that have a big drought of no games and then release a game again.

116
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,985
Speaker 1: Never complain about that.

117
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:31,796
Speaker 0: but asshole if you release a game too soon after another game I won't be done with Smash Brothers, but I'll have Mario Kart and that'll be frustrating.

118
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:32,760
Speaker 0: on two games at once.

119
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,344
Speaker 0: It's no good.

120
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:40,617
Speaker 1: Some of you might make the argument which is true in some cases that oh Well you old men with your podcast and your jobs don't have the free time that us college kids do.

121
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:40,718
Speaker 1: so.

122
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:42,732
Speaker 1: as a result You need more time.

123
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:48,657
Speaker 1: We're already done with brawl But I point out that when we were in college brawl lasted us like three years.

124
00:07:48,698 --> 00:08:00,293
Speaker 1: well melee Yeah And there was pretty much one continuous game going on being handed off controller to controller at some point in our apartments Pretty much for as long as we were at our IT.

125
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:07,000
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway, this is Mario Kart Wii that is coming out is gonna have little plastic steering wheels and whatnot.

126
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,743
Speaker 0: And you know, whatever.

127
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:11,034
Speaker 1: am I gonna have to take my DS?

128
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:12,680
Speaker 1: Well, not my DS is not a DS game.

129
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:18,086
Speaker 1: Am I gonna have to waggle the stick back and forth forth so hard that my hand hurts Continuously in order to get good score.

130
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:21,859
Speaker 0: In fact, my news is that you will definitely not have to do so.

131
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:26,720
Speaker 0: The Mario Kart Wii will have no snaking whatsoever.

132
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:36,133
Speaker 0: It'll actually be a game of racing skill where the longer you hold Your power slide the bigger a boost you will have when you let go.

133
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:38,100
Speaker 1: that is so hardcore because that's the most fun.

134
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,472
Speaker 0: I think that is what the intention was.

135
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:46,380
Speaker 0: I think in the DS one It just the way they programmed it like by holding a boost longer.

136
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:48,551
Speaker 0: You would get blue but holding a slide longer.

137
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,160
Speaker 0: You got blue sparks, right?

138
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,707
Speaker 0: But you but you could.

139
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:56,052
Speaker 0: actually the way it was programmed You could actually do multiple boosts and go faster.

140
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:57,620
Speaker 0: You could actually do boost on straightaways.

141
00:08:57,941 --> 00:09:07,727
Speaker 0: I don't think that's going to be possible at least from what Nintendo says in the Wii version Which I think is actually gonna be great because you know, you're gonna be steering by, you know Twisting the Wiimote back and forth.

142
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,820
Speaker 0: You're not gonna be wanna have to do multiple boots per turn.

143
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:11,980
Speaker 0: That's gonna hurt a lot.

144
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:15,280
Speaker 0: And I think this is great because you know It's.

145
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:22,385
Speaker 0: it's finally the first time since the GBA Mario Kart my favorite Mario Kart where there's no snaking there's.

146
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:26,867
Speaker 0: no, you know, it's a decent game and They're not gonna have.

147
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:35,760
Speaker 0: it's not gonna be cheating like, you know Sick Mario 64 kart 64 and it's not gonna have some gimmick like the to the tag team stuff of Double Dash.

148
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:38,574
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a real Mario Kart and I'm all about it.

149
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,631
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Everyone get Mario Kart Wii.

150
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:48,780
Speaker 1: All right, Scott, just so you know I'm not gonna get into this but all the information about Gran Turismo 5 prologue is on the Wikipedia about the game.

151
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,749
Speaker 0: No, no, no, but what is that Gran Turismo 5?

152
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:53,996
Speaker 0: No, so what's Gran Turismo 5?

153
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:55,360
Speaker 1: Gran Turismo 5?

154
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,741
Speaker 0: So what?

155
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:56,463
Speaker 0: what's the difference?

156
00:09:56,543 --> 00:10:04,481
Speaker 1: Gran Turismo 5 prologue is the precursor to the planned Gran Turismo 5?

157
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:10,521
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, it's basically Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 5 is Gran Turismo 6.

158
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:11,163
Speaker 0: Say that's.

159
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:14,493
Speaker 0: it was not easy because with the naming and the is it a demo?

160
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:15,797
Speaker 0: is it just a preview?

161
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:19,020
Speaker 0: is like Gran Turismo 5 just gonna be this game with more stuff.

162
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,215
Speaker 1: Whoa, this short version title is a precursor to polyphony.

163
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:26,481
Speaker 1: polyphony digital's bland Gran Turismo 5.

164
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:36,166
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, Gran Turismo 5 prologue features 16 player online races over 60 cars 14 tuned cars five tracks 7.1 HD sound.

165
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:38,132
Speaker 0: that sounds like a whole game to me.

166
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:40,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sounds like a prologue.

167
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:51,960
Speaker 1: Anyway, well, apparently there was a Gran Turismo 4 prologue that was released everywhere But the United States one year before Gran Turismo 4 came out.

168
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:58,160
Speaker 0: If I would have known that it would have made a lot more sense.

169
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:00,080
Speaker 0: But the five prologue is coming out in the US.

170
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:05,820
Speaker 1: It looks like Top Gear is gonna be involved in this with their track is in the game episodic contents.

171
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:21,920
Speaker 0: See actually this really isn't a bad idea this prologue thing because what you can do is You know some video games take a long time to make right and every time and you want to take your time to make it Just right, especially when it's such a big project like this, right?

172
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:29,980
Speaker 0: But if you take too long You're not gonna make any money Because you're gonna spend all this money Developing and developing and you're not gonna make any money for years and years and years and the fuck.

173
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

174
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:39,593
Speaker 0: And also, you know people will be like all delays Delays with this sort of prologue thing.

175
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:46,880
Speaker 0: where you can do is you can make a game You can sort of put out more than a demo but less than the full version for amount of money.

176
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:53,020
Speaker 0: Sell it to finance the further development and it's it's not really, you know, I can kind of go for that.

177
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:58,157
Speaker 1: Hey, actually they're gonna support a really really good racing wheel.

178
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:05,149
Speaker 0: it looks like By a ps3 and an HDTV two wheels.

179
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:08,357
Speaker 1: and this game, you know what it almost would be.

180
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:11,673
Speaker 1: where I have to try the game first It's only like five thousand dollars.

181
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:12,719
Speaker 1: my whole life, right?

182
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:25,340
Speaker 1: I've always wanted a ultra realistic car simulator because I'd love to be a Crazy good driver and imagine a video game that is so accurate that practicing on it is tantamount to practicing real car.

183
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:29,336
Speaker 1: Also, then I can try out cars that I will never own my entire life.

184
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:35,229
Speaker 1: Yeah The only thing it really would lack is the whole Feeling the car around you.

185
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:37,360
Speaker 1: Of course, I could get that initial D thing from Japan.

186
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,631
Speaker 0: Why don't you try that live for speed thing?

187
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:41,340
Speaker 1: How much money is that?

188
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:49,840
Speaker 0: I don't I'm not sure but it's like probably more than a PlayStation Really fancy PC racing simulator like, you know those fancy PC flight simulators.

189
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,651
Speaker 0: This is sort of like the same thing but for racing.

190
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:53,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

191
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:54,480
Speaker 1: I don't know this game.

192
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,727
Speaker 1: I don't think I'll get a ps3 for it just yet.

193
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:02,204
Speaker 1: But if you have a ps3 and you like racing games One you should get this game.

194
00:13:02,224 --> 00:13:08,425
Speaker 1: more importantly if you get this game and you do not have a good racing wheel What the hell is wrong with you?

195
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:14,042
Speaker 1: I mean seriously who plays a racing game with an analog stick, especially a realistic one I live for?

196
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:16,631
Speaker 0: speed is forty seven dollars and sixty two cents.

197
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:18,418
Speaker 1: All right, is it good?

198
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,100
Speaker 1: Is it perfect?

199
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:20,201
Speaker 0: It's.

200
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:23,272
Speaker 0: it's a really fancy racing simulator much like the flight simulator.

201
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:23,914
Speaker 0: That's all I know.

202
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:25,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll have to look into this business.

203
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:27,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, not that I play PC games.

204
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:30,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna buy a wheel for the PC, right?

205
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:31,896
Speaker 1: I would if it was good enough.

206
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:32,659
Speaker 1: I'll look into this.

207
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:35,511
Speaker 1: All right, I can boot into Windows about half the time.

208
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:37,440
Speaker 1: Okay, the other half the time windows won't boot.

209
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:39,928
Speaker 0: All right, we got news over there.

210
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:41,473
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I got doing news.

211
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:44,808
Speaker 1: Well, there was no gaming news I cared about and Scott did two newses.

212
00:13:44,828 --> 00:13:45,954
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna do something crazy.

213
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,180
Speaker 1: I got a geek bite here.

214
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:53,616
Speaker 1: Oh, no Now there's been this mod for counter-strike this zombie mod and what's one of those?

215
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:54,840
Speaker 1: really good idea?

216
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,299
Speaker 1: Really poor execution really hacked together Only fun once or twice and then gets real old.

217
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:07,700
Speaker 1: Well, uh, we wondered why didn't anyone make a zombie mod for like half-life a half-life 2 or something?

218
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,520
Speaker 0: Well, actually I was just you know, I wanted to play an FPS really badly.

219
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,519
Speaker 0: So I started looking for you know mods to plus zombie panic exclamation point source.

220
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:22,320
Speaker 1: Mmm, it's actually not at all fun yet and barely playable.

221
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,940
Speaker 1: But they're working on it and a lot of the concepts in this thing are real good.

222
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,860
Speaker 0: And as long as they it's better than the average mod, but it's not great.

223
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:33,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, as long as they continue to work on it, it'll be good.

224
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,617
Speaker 1: But then again, I'm not too.

225
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:36,500
Speaker 1: I don't know.

226
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:44,799
Speaker 1: I don't have a lot of confidence because this has been around for years And if it's all been around for years, but the source one is much newer than the non source one.

227
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:51,057
Speaker 1: in 2006 zombie panic source was picked as one of mod DB's top 100 unreleased mods of the year.

228
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:55,028
Speaker 1: Yep Wow in 2007 it was marked again.

229
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:55,489
Speaker 1: They went.

230
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:59,640
Speaker 0: that released my a hundred over a hundred unreleased mods.

231
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:01,466
Speaker 1: That says something.

232
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:10,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they began development in 2005 And the game is fun, but it really doesn't work at all.

233
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:12,806
Speaker 0: it works It just doesn't work super well.

234
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:15,740
Speaker 1: Yeah play it more than once and it turns it ends up being not fun.

235
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:16,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, it depends.

236
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:18,289
Speaker 1: every map is broken.

237
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,380
Speaker 1: If you don't play objective mode the game is just completely broke.

238
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:22,964
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah you need to play objective mode.

239
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:25,654
Speaker 1: half the objectives just don't work or no one knows what to do.

240
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:29,689
Speaker 1: all the controls for Managing ammo or controls are managing.

241
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:30,733
Speaker 0: that's really annoying.

242
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:32,640
Speaker 0: I gotta say it's the number one thing that's wrong with it.

243
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:33,746
Speaker 1: Here's the cool idea.

244
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:47,839
Speaker 1: the game starts out much like the game vampire tag in that one player is a zombie who can infect or kill and Everyone else is just some human with a gun and very little ammo and maybe some melee weapons.

245
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,009
Speaker 1: now I'll point out so I have to say it again.

246
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:54,234
Speaker 1: The melee weapons are designed as All FPS melee weapons are.

247
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:54,859
Speaker 1: they're awful.

248
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:59,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean they some of them can do some pretty big damage, but try hitting with them.

249
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:05,060
Speaker 0: Good luck with that, especially you don't want to hit with them because the zombies only have melee attacks.

250
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:10,265
Speaker 0: So trying to go after a zombie with a melee weapon, that's not pretty much on the brink of death It's just.

251
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:11,679
Speaker 0: it's a guaranteed death for you.

252
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:15,360
Speaker 0: It's totally not fun because the melee weapons are used for breaking things.

253
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:24,759
Speaker 1: The melee weapons are no better than the melee weapons in the goddamn Ninja mod for quake 2 and if anyone else played that my hat is off to you.

254
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,276
Speaker 1: But that aside the hammer was the best weapon.

255
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:44,539
Speaker 1: But anyway so other than that you you know You find guns or shotguns and AKs and all these different guns and every gun takes a different kind of ammo and you can drop Individual specific amounts of different ammo from different guns to give to other people, right?

256
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:54,152
Speaker 0: So like if I have like if I have a rifle and have lots of rifle ammo, but I pick up some shotgun ammo I don't you know carrying that around makes me walk slower.

257
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,000
Speaker 0: It burdens me so I want to get rid of it.

258
00:16:56,281 --> 00:17:01,280
Speaker 0: So you have to move this little arrow up and down and then push a button to drop your shotgun ammo.

259
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:12,500
Speaker 1: It's really annoying and while the sort of resource management survival mode thing is really cool It's almost totally mitigated by the fact that the way it's implemented is fiddly and completely non-fun.

260
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,780
Speaker 0: I think the real problem with this sort of zombie survival game right is that it plays in rounds that are like counter-strike.

261
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:21,395
Speaker 0: You know, it's like play around play around play around.

262
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:29,497
Speaker 0: as you know Many FPS's are want to do and as the engine is sort of designed to do but a Survival game really has to be sort of long.

263
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:34,184
Speaker 0: Oh my What I would do Have objective.

264
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:35,290
Speaker 1: Well, this game has all that.

265
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,019
Speaker 1: It's just it's not that fun.

266
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:45,600
Speaker 1: yet what I would do is I'd make a game like this where Human that the goal is simply survive for the humans and kill for the zombies and there's million ways to do that.

267
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:50,293
Speaker 1: But it's basically how long can the humans hold out?

268
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:52,680
Speaker 1: and then you switch it up.

269
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:55,629
Speaker 1: How long can the other humans hold out?

270
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:57,174
Speaker 0: and it's not bad.

271
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:02,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, you want to get it to the point where Eventually, you will run out of all your bullets.

272
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:04,446
Speaker 1: Eventually, the zombies will get you.

273
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:07,374
Speaker 1: there is no way to win as the humans.

274
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:09,400
Speaker 1: It is only how long do you hold out?

275
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,540
Speaker 1: It's not bad like defending a house infinite horde.

276
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,420
Speaker 1: I can think of a million ways to do it, but I don't want to get bogged down.

277
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,558
Speaker 0: What I was really looking for was some sort of co-op mod Like I wanted it to be like me and rim versus a bunch of AI zombies.

278
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:22,723
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

279
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:24,249
Speaker 1: is Scott yells at me.

280
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,032
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

281
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:26,457
Speaker 1: I found this co-op zombie mod.

282
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:27,040
Speaker 1: Let's play it.

283
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:28,285
Speaker 1: So we put all this effort.

284
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:29,712
Speaker 1: It said co-op zombie mod.

285
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:30,496
Speaker 0: It was lying.

286
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:30,898
Speaker 0: Yes.

287
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:31,260
Speaker 1: It's not.

288
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:34,086
Speaker 0: It's a team zombie mod.

289
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:35,351
Speaker 0: Not a co-op zombie mod.

290
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:37,358
Speaker 1: It's just counter zombie as opposed to yeah.

291
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,813
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's worth playing once or twice.

292
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,606
Speaker 1: They really need Half-life 2.

293
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:44,652
Speaker 0: it's free, right?

294
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:45,840
Speaker 0: So why why not?

295
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,438
Speaker 1: well, it takes you know, like 20 minutes to download it and get it set up and then you'll have to learn the controls.

296
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:54,998
Speaker 1: and the only one cool mechanic I like is that humans are real slow.

297
00:18:55,019 --> 00:19:04,153
Speaker 0: and Well humans are actually if you're not carrying anything are the fastest, but if you're uninjured They're pretty much real slow because you're gonna be carrying stuff.

298
00:19:04,414 --> 00:19:04,494
Speaker 1: Yeah.

299
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:08,148
Speaker 1: Anyway, there is Zombie panic mode.

300
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,052
Speaker 1: hence the title of the mod.

301
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:11,000
Speaker 1: you hit a button and your guy panics.

302
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:19,300
Speaker 1: He drops half the stuff he's carrying and starts going But at the same time he goes stupidly fast and you can run away.

303
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:23,000
Speaker 0: Yep, and mostly you get much faster because he dropped a bunch of stuff.

304
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,280
Speaker 1: But also you just get faster and the whole the the speeds of everything are really finely tuned in this game.

305
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,200
Speaker 1: I feel like they put more effort into that then into the rest of them.

306
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:44,414
Speaker 0: I think that's that's a very important thing that they it's good They paid attention to because the zombies having only melee weapons, right which is their hands, you know The speed of the of the players and the their ability to move is everything.

307
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:50,520
Speaker 0: because if the human can move faster than the zombie The zombie can never catch it and then that's a stalemate and it's stupid, you know.

308
00:19:50,600 --> 00:20:01,199
Speaker 0: But if the zombie moves faster than the human, you know The way the zombies work with their regenerating health and and there are lots and lots of damage with their melee weapon Then the humans have no chance.

309
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:09,600
Speaker 0: So you really you have to you know Really finely tuned how speeds are affected by different things and such to to make the game work out.

310
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:18,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only other thing I can say is that Natural selection probably as a mod has the best new new friendly environment in the history of mods.

311
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:23,900
Speaker 1: If you join a natural selection server and you have no idea how to play pretty much everyone on both teams will help you.

312
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:27,138
Speaker 1: Zombie panic.

313
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:30,011
Speaker 1: And this game is not noob friendly.

314
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:31,360
Speaker 1: Everyone is going to be a cock to you.

315
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,020
Speaker 1: There's going to be yelling at you because you don't know what button to hit.

316
00:20:34,422 --> 00:20:36,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know where the objective is the game doesn't tell you.

317
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:46,196
Speaker 1: Learning the maps is really hard and annoying and it's like yeah, don't expect anyone to help you when you play this game But luckily you're not gonna want to play this game very much.

318
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:47,785
Speaker 1: It's not Great.

319
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:49,131
Speaker 0: speaking of natural selection.

320
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:50,939
Speaker 0: I just went to the website cuz you mentioned them.

321
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:54,620
Speaker 0: Yes, they put out the 20th episode of their podcast.

322
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:59,556
Speaker 1: Did they say in that episode that the new natural selection is going to come?

323
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:02,708
Speaker 0: No, they say Investment received.

324
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,716
Speaker 0: they secured investment from partners.

325
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:10,542
Speaker 1: Ah, ah Ah There's only one Possible.

326
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:15,195
Speaker 1: well now there are three items of news in the gaming world that could come out.

327
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,920
Speaker 1: that would be better than that.

328
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,731
Speaker 1: The first one would be natural selection.

329
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,659
Speaker 1: source is out and playable right now.

330
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,003
Speaker 0: Natural it's not gonna be.

331
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:25,872
Speaker 0: natural selection - I believe is what it's gonna be called whatever.

332
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:35,488
Speaker 1: whatever ain't I knew natural selection comes out I guess - would be tribes - put back together Re-released and now available for playing online.

333
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:49,500
Speaker 0: Whoever natural selection - I predict will come out by 2010. if it doesn't come out in the year 2010, then I'll be wrong and It'll be the new and when it comes out, it will become the new greatest online FPS.

334
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:54,237
Speaker 1: Oh when it maintain that title for years if that game ever comes out is going to be.

335
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:55,200
Speaker 0: that is my prediction.

336
00:21:56,221 --> 00:21:57,547
Speaker 1: Natural selection is so good.

337
00:21:57,587 --> 00:21:59,013
Speaker 1: If you have never played it go play it.

338
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:00,480
Speaker 1: people still do an episode on it.

339
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,241
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure we did.

340
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:02,482
Speaker 0: Let's do things of the day now.

341
00:22:02,602 --> 00:22:10,829
Speaker 1: Okay, so things of the day.

342
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:11,690
Speaker 0: that was quick.

343
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:14,702
Speaker 0: You got a thing today or you want me to do mine?

344
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:15,790
Speaker 1: I guess you can do yours.

345
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:18,922
Speaker 0: All right, you know my my two news is we're racing related.

346
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:22,211
Speaker 0: So here we have a Ad.

347
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:23,575
Speaker 0: yeah, I know it's an ad.

348
00:22:23,615 --> 00:22:27,347
Speaker 0: it's annoying for a car specifically the Pontiac something or other.

349
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:27,949
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

350
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:33,610
Speaker 0: This ad is the coolest ad for a car I've ever seen in my entire life.

351
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:41,684
Speaker 1: It is very rare to run afoul of someone out there in the business world in the marketing world Who was tasked with making a bit of marketing.

352
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:42,729
Speaker 1: who knew?

353
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,513
Speaker 1: Who got it?

354
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:45,436
Speaker 1: That's the only way I can put it.

355
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:46,239
Speaker 1: who gets it.

356
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:56,578
Speaker 0: This is the only ad for a car I've ever seen that actually Somehow I don't know how but some psychology something Unconscious in my brain.

357
00:22:56,598 --> 00:23:08,570
Speaker 1: It kind of makes me wanna like learn Maybe I want this car the fact that it includes Actual footage from the original game and then it goes back to that at the end with a little explosion.

358
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:11,008
Speaker 1: This I think this is the best ad ever made.

359
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:17,089
Speaker 0: Maybe you should see this ad if you're a geek of any kind of video games.

360
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:21,101
Speaker 1: now If you're watching this ad and you don't know what the game is you suck.

361
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:25,668
Speaker 1: No, it's more that you're a lot younger than us And you suck.

362
00:23:26,793 --> 00:23:28,809
Speaker 1: So, uh, what what game was this ad?

363
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:30,353
Speaker 0: This how?

364
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:32,061
Speaker 0: I think people should know when they see the ad.

365
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:39,945
Speaker 0: we telling them would be sort of like Let me tell you I'll say this then if that's like being like this is a square class.

366
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:42,858
Speaker 1: if they made a movie About this game.

367
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,459
Speaker 1: It would look exactly Like this advertisement.

368
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,254
Speaker 0: Oh and there would be no Actors except for cars.

369
00:23:51,238 --> 00:23:52,683
Speaker 1: I would go see that movie in the theater.

370
00:23:52,884 --> 00:23:53,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, just cars.

371
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:54,450
Speaker 0: No, no people.

372
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:57,350
Speaker 1: Hell if that ad were the trailer for the movie, I would go see it in the theater.

373
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:00,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, I go see an opening night pre-ordered wait in line.

374
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,570
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.

375
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:09,220
Speaker 1: So, um speaking of old games What if you took an old Nintendo cartridge and made something out of it?

376
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,130
Speaker 1: people do that all the time like a crack pipe or?

377
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,855
Speaker 1: Something I don't know.

378
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:14,469
Speaker 0: whatever do that all the time.

379
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:16,135
Speaker 1: Well, I we found something.

380
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:24,641
Speaker 1: Scott found this we kind of swapped things of the day around here because we really wanted to talk about And we thought it would be very interesting if I had all racing things.

381
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:27,190
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah, and I also spoiled it spy hunter.

382
00:24:35,055 --> 00:24:45,710
Speaker 1: I think I've ever seen anyone turn Into a harmonica.

383
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,599
Speaker 0: Doo doo dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.

384
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:54,542
Speaker 1: it's such an obvious and good idea And I'm just maybe someone has done it before.

385
00:24:54,602 --> 00:24:56,490
Speaker 1: but we found this and here it is.

386
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,847
Speaker 0: It's so ironic because you would blow into your NES cartridge, but now blowing into the any ice car.

387
00:25:01,887 --> 00:25:02,729
Speaker 0: She produces music.

388
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:06,782
Speaker 1: Putting that any ice cartridge in does not make a game come out.

389
00:25:07,043 --> 00:25:07,484
Speaker 1: No.

390
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:08,066
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

391
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:09,030
Speaker 0: It's okay.

392
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,236
Speaker 0: I think you use tech mobile.

393
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:11,725
Speaker 0: He probably still has super tech mobile.

394
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:15,510
Speaker 1: So he's okay Right, so what are we gonna review tonight?

395
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,450
Speaker 1: I mean, we've been doing video games lately and board games and such and role-playing games.

396
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,282
Speaker 0: Well, we didn't play enough Smash Brothers yet.

397
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:22,369
Speaker 0: So maybe we'll talk about the next week.

398
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:26,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, well also we really have to get the fullness of that game and you all cut.

399
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:27,935
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone wants to hear.

400
00:25:27,955 --> 00:25:29,179
Speaker 1: oh my god.

401
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,130
Speaker 1: I'm playing it metanide something blah blah blah.

402
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,118
Speaker 1: You wanna hear a real kind of in-depth review, right?

403
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I mean plus.

404
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:39,330
Speaker 0: seriously Anyone who's gonna buy the game has already bought it.

405
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:44,730
Speaker 0: He really see the point in doing a review except I guess there'll be people in the future when wheeze are cheap.

406
00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:46,258
Speaker 0: The list they'll be like, huh?

407
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:47,586
Speaker 0: What Wii games do I get?

408
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:48,190
Speaker 0: and it's like.

409
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:53,542
Speaker 0: It amazes me how many people like ask us like what DS game should I get?

410
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:57,311
Speaker 0: It's sort of obvious like I Don't know.

411
00:25:57,732 --> 00:25:58,575
Speaker 0: It's obvious to me.

412
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:00,281
Speaker 0: Anyway, like what the big hit games.

413
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:03,050
Speaker 1: Oh, it's obvious to you the person who played those games.

414
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:09,459
Speaker 0: Yes, cuz I buy them anyway All right, so today I guess we'll talk about the.

415
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,946
Speaker 0: the professor Layton right how much have you played?

416
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:15,557
Speaker 1: I've got 998 picker ads.

417
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:17,005
Speaker 0: how many puzzles did you complete?

418
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:17,669
Speaker 1: I don't know.

419
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:19,499
Speaker 0: I beat the whole game, but I didn't.

420
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,310
Speaker 0: I maybe left a handful of puzzles.

421
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,470
Speaker 1: I haven't really gotten to the point of getting any information about the actual mystery of the game.

422
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:26,878
Speaker 0: well, see that's the thing about.

423
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:34,129
Speaker 0: the first thing I tell you about this game right is the game is sort of a plot combined with puzzles and that's pretty much it right.

424
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:41,278
Speaker 0: and The plot is these mysteries and at the beginning of the game There's a mystery and then you kind of solve that mystery.

425
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:42,863
Speaker 1: Well that we can spoil that.

426
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:44,549
Speaker 1: Oh my god the cat.

427
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:45,793
Speaker 1: right off We got the cat.

428
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:47,902
Speaker 0: Yes, then it was right.

429
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:55,246
Speaker 0: there as the game goes on They add more and more mysteries and they never solve any of the mystery.

430
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:56,370
Speaker 0: They even have this little screen.

431
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:06,401
Speaker 1: They're like you've unlocked the mystery of the dead body or the mystery of the scary thing and you'll pretty much unlock all the mysteries And then all get solved.

432
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:10,149
Speaker 0: only at the end of the game You just sort of solve like a whole bunch of it.

433
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,056
Speaker 0: You solve all the mysteries at once pretty much.

434
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:24,045
Speaker 0: The thing is even though I didn't solve the mysteries in-game Until the very end which is how it's supposed to be I solved them in my brain like when I had around 40 puzzles complete.

435
00:27:24,406 --> 00:27:25,470
Speaker 0: I figured out everything.

436
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,834
Speaker 0: Basically the story is.

437
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:31,025
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna summarize the basics of the story.

438
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:33,950
Speaker 1: before you summarize the story We should summarize what the game is.

439
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:41,070
Speaker 1: The game is half an anime that you watch and you unlock pieces of the anime by solving math problems.

440
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:43,544
Speaker 0: Some of them are math problems or logic puzzles.

441
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:47,337
Speaker 0: Yeah Some of them are visual puzzles.

442
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:50,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, but usually they're visual puzzles that are solved by logic.

443
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:51,067
Speaker 0: Yes.

444
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:55,130
Speaker 0: Yes, usually and Yeah, you know you've played puzzle.

445
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,550
Speaker 0: You've probably done puzzles like these before in your life, especially if you were in like the math Olympiad in middle school.

446
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:04,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, you ever done the puzzle where it's like there's three sheep and three.

447
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:06,250
Speaker 0: There's three sheep and three wolves, right?

448
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,922
Speaker 0: And you got to get them from one side of the river to the other.

449
00:28:08,942 --> 00:28:16,450
Speaker 0: if there's ever more Wolves than sheep on one side of the river then the sheep the wolves will eat the sheep and you'll be screwed.

450
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:28,993
Speaker 0: And you have to put at least one wolf or one sheep onto the boat at a time in order to you know Not have in order to get it to go across When it's empty.

451
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:35,252
Speaker 1: my dad's twice as old as my mom and my mom is four times as old as my brother and my brother's Tears older than me.

452
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:36,234
Speaker 1: How old is the dog?

453
00:28:36,274 --> 00:28:37,137
Speaker 1: kind of problems?

454
00:28:37,397 --> 00:28:40,044
Speaker 0: Yep, though, or I have 12 match.

455
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:41,488
Speaker 0: I have 12 matchsticks.

456
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:45,958
Speaker 0: Fuck you Or like, you know, it'll be.

457
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:47,929
Speaker 0: the matchstick ones are like, you know.

458
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:48,894
Speaker 0: Look at the.

459
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:53,953
Speaker 0: these matchsticks are arranged in a way that you know draws That you know.

460
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:59,850
Speaker 0: four squares move only two matchsticks so that there are only three squares instead of four square.

461
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:12,830
Speaker 1: one thing I got to say about this game is that you expect a certain kind of level of sensibility from Nintendo games and the game looks a little bit like cutesy like this is gonna be a very wide audience kid friendly little game.

462
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,545
Speaker 1: But it's it skirts the edge a little more than you'd expect.

463
00:29:16,585 --> 00:29:17,670
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember one of the puzzles.

464
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:25,830
Speaker 1: This is it's a really hilarious puzzle is Doggy and it shows there's the doggy made out of matchsticks gets run the fuck over by a car.

465
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:26,974
Speaker 1: What's he look like now?

466
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:28,139
Speaker 1: move to matches?

467
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,243
Speaker 0: I love that puzzle.

468
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:31,190
Speaker 0: That was like I got that puzzle right away.

469
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,390
Speaker 0: But meanwhile to rim and someone else I know both had wicked trouble on that puzzle.

470
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,699
Speaker 1: No The only trouble I had was the first time.

471
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:40,346
Speaker 1: I was like I know what the dog looks like.

472
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:43,864
Speaker 1: so I drew the dog Squashed but I angled one of the matches wrong.

473
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:47,039
Speaker 1: It was like no you're wrong I'm like, ah, and then I drew it again.

474
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:49,028
Speaker 1: my angled right and there was like, yeah, you got.

475
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:49,570
Speaker 0: yes one thing.

476
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,209
Speaker 0: I was very careful to make sure all the things are like.

477
00:29:52,853 --> 00:29:54,300
Speaker 1: I got that one puzzle wrong.

478
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:57,234
Speaker 1: I was like double careful and everything else It was one puzzle.

479
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:57,977
Speaker 0: right where it's like.

480
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:01,090
Speaker 0: here are five playing cards and it then it was a logic puzzle.

481
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,351
Speaker 0: Like.

482
00:30:01,412 --> 00:30:03,441
Speaker 0: this card comes before this card.

483
00:30:03,522 --> 00:30:05,190
Speaker 0: this card comes after that card.

484
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:09,650
Speaker 0: This card is you know, not third and what you know that sort of puzzle.

485
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:11,781
Speaker 0: So I arranged I moved.

486
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:13,530
Speaker 0: all the cards are sitting there in slot.

487
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,989
Speaker 0: So I moved them all around and then I pushed submit and it said you're wrong and I'm like I'm like.

488
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:18,652
Speaker 0: no I'm right.

489
00:30:19,074 --> 00:30:20,800
Speaker 0: I had to put them in different slots.

490
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:23,069
Speaker 0: There were another set of slots that I didn't see.

491
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:27,112
Speaker 0: If there was another set of slots Why did it?

492
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:33,470
Speaker 0: let me rearrange the cards within the slots that they were already in as opposed, you know, it's the anyway.

493
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's fun.

494
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:42,790
Speaker 0: If you like solving clever little puzzles Like if you like doing you know, you buy those puzzle books in the store that you know.

495
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:47,970
Speaker 0: I don't know how popular they are now, but I remember before you know, the big portable video games are awesome.

496
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,556
Speaker 0: You would go to the store.

497
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:58,550
Speaker 0: you buy a book of word search or a book of crossword puzzle But they had the other ones that were like book of logic puzzle or book of you know, acrostics.

498
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:00,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, this game is for you.

499
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:02,810
Speaker 0: Good God if you like those things.

500
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:07,119
Speaker 1: But then again at the same time if you're really into those things You've seen every one of these puzzles before prop

501
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,991
Speaker 0: or some cut some, you know similar puzzle Yeah,

502
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:16,830
Speaker 1: but then again, there's the nice benefit that you might have seen similar puzzles before but the puzzles are actually really really really varied.

503
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:24,163
Speaker 1: And on top of that a lot of the puzzles are set up such that That the game uses the fact that you are on a video game console.

504
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:27,494
Speaker 1: so well in that like, you know The classic puzzle of.

505
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:32,395
Speaker 1: I've got three pictures the whole different amounts and I have to get the liquid I love.

506
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:33,670
Speaker 0: those are my favorite ones.

507
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:38,688
Speaker 0: I did and the problem was I did all those picture puzzles like right away and then there were none left.

508
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:45,110
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but doing those on paper and like the math Olympiad when yeah, it's like sucked.

509
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:48,680
Speaker 0: I've got one pitcher of water and has ten liters.

510
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:52,150
Speaker 0: I've got a three liter pitcher and a five liter pitcher.

511
00:31:52,631 --> 00:31:54,237
Speaker 1: How can I get to four liter pitch?

512
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:57,690
Speaker 0: How can I get to four to four liter pitchers, you know?

513
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:04,710
Speaker 0: It's like ah, but this it lets you actually pour the water from one to the other and it's mad fun mad fun.

514
00:32:04,852 --> 00:32:05,527
Speaker 0: I love doing that.

515
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:14,326
Speaker 0: Yeah I could just do water pitcher puzzles from like now till the end of time also like weight puzzles where it's like Here's a here's a scale and here's a bunch of weights.

516
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:15,935
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know Oh, that one was really.

517
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,162
Speaker 1: it's one of the really early ones too.

518
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:18,490
Speaker 1: It's like here's eight weights.

519
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:20,402
Speaker 1: One of them is lighter than all the rest.

520
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:21,550
Speaker 1: You can use the scale twice.

521
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,252
Speaker 1: Which one is it?

522
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:26,365
Speaker 1: And the cool thing is I actually I was curious how the game works.

523
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:28,030
Speaker 0: So it randomize them.

524
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:32,529
Speaker 1: Yes time I tested that to be sure I was like one two, three four five six seven eight.

525
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,645
Speaker 1: Yep, they're uneven and I kept doing it and the sides kept switching like yep.

526
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,770
Speaker 1: They don't let people cheat.

527
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,773
Speaker 1: How awesome is that?

528
00:32:38,994 --> 00:32:40,218
Speaker 0: It's pretty awesome right there.

529
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:41,723
Speaker 0: You actually have to solve the puzzle.

530
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:43,950
Speaker 0: You can't just sort of go by luck.

531
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:54,320
Speaker 0: I mean, there's some puzzles where you can go by luck Like there'll be a multiple choice like ABCD, which is the odd one out and if you choose wrong It'll say you're wrong and it'll take away picker ads from you.

532
00:32:54,862 --> 00:32:57,290
Speaker 0: So it's like it really encourages you.

533
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,788
Speaker 0: I mean you could just be like a B C D and you'll get it right.

534
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:07,010
Speaker 1: but then Puzzles you're not going to because it's just like what's the answer and you just write a number?

535
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:10,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really good at recognizing what number you write.

536
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:14,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, God The handwriting recognition in this game is absolutely fantastic.

537
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,970
Speaker 0: Well, cuz it only has to recognize, you know, like letters and numbers and it puts that little grid there and it's it's really smart.

538
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:34,301
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course The one thing that was really really smart about that This is when they want you to type in like your name in the beginning It always asks you uppercase or lowercase which may just from a programming perspective Makes it a thousand times easier to recognize characters.

539
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:36,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, like how's it gonna recognize uppercase or lowercase C?

540
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:45,710
Speaker 1: That's really hard really hard for you to do and it does Recognize the way I write to and for as opposed to the way some other heathens write.

541
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:49,085
Speaker 0: I think also the way that it presents the input interface.

542
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:56,130
Speaker 0: for you know Writing the numbers and letters in it really sort of encourages you to sort of write them carefully and neatly.

543
00:33:56,372 --> 00:34:07,068
Speaker 0: It is like a little school is like a cross and it's like, okay So I put the top right of my letter in the top right box and out, you know Actually, I think carefully though I've written just in like one corner and it works just as well.

544
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:07,510
Speaker 0: Oh it does.

545
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does but it encourages you to write neatly.

546
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:16,494
Speaker 1: I think what also encourages you to write neatly is the fact that Layton is so gentlemanly and neat and precise that you feel bad About being all scribbly.

547
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:17,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, you definitely feel bad.

548
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,870
Speaker 1: Layton is so cool and he's such a badass.

549
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:23,589
Speaker 0: So here's the story of the game, right?

550
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,996
Speaker 0: You've got the.

551
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,484
Speaker 0: I have 12 match.

552
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:30,869
Speaker 0: I have 12 match six But you have a guy named professor Layton and he's all British.

553
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:40,110
Speaker 1: Take like Sherlock Holmes Remove the pretension and add like lady killer and civility and and just consummate badass.

554
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:42,179
Speaker 0: Right, and he's got a little assistant.

555
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,083
Speaker 0: What's the assistant's name?

556
00:34:43,103 --> 00:34:46,476
Speaker 1: I Already forgot and I play.

557
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:47,199
Speaker 1: I play the game.

558
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,150
Speaker 1: I was playing it like an hour ago little kid who's dressed in blue.

559
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:59,100
Speaker 0: he's really funny cuz he's kind of funny and The game has actual like animated video Cutscenes that are like fully voice acted.

560
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,461
Speaker 1: fully

561
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:20,450
Speaker 0: voice acted in the voice acting is pretty good except personally, like the voice acting is high quality it really goes well, but When ever you beat a puzzle the character either Layton or the kid is like, you know They say something like catchphrase like you got it or like yeah I solved the puzzle or every puzzle has an answer.

562
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:24,150
Speaker 1: I think my favorite one is like logic and reason win the day or something like that.

563
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:26,469
Speaker 0: I like, you know, I like that.

564
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:37,890
Speaker 0: But hearing them over and over and over they got a little bit, you know Cuz there weren't enough variations of the success voice acting that it sort of got a little annoying hearing the same ones over and over.

565
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:38,876
Speaker 0: I don't know just me.

566
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,264
Speaker 1: maybe see it didn't bother me at all.

567
00:35:40,425 --> 00:35:40,888
Speaker 0: It bothered me.

568
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,947
Speaker 0: Anyway, of course then again that the voice acting in the videos is just fine.

569
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:45,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's great.

570
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:51,439
Speaker 1: and I'll just say the soundscape the way like the sound design of this game is absolutely amazing.

571
00:35:51,479 --> 00:36:02,363
Speaker 1: the background music is Interesting enough to where you'll probably find yourself playing this game with headphones or with the sound all the way up Even after you've been playing the game for hours and hours and hours.

572
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:03,730
Speaker 1: You've already heard all the music, right?

573
00:36:04,071 --> 00:36:07,730
Speaker 0: So professor Layton and his kid are driving their car to this town in the middle of nowhere.

574
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:13,390
Speaker 0: He got a. professor Layton received a letter in the mail about someone had inherited some monies.

575
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:16,341
Speaker 1: It's a very LePon the third kind of plot.

576
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:27,369
Speaker 1: It is a very LePon the third plot without the stealing though Yeah, but it's kind of like a Cagliostro-ian plot Kinda, yeah, it's like oh there's the treasure but is the treasure what you think it is?

577
00:36:27,971 --> 00:36:30,058
Speaker 1: Ah, the treasure is my only daughter.

578
00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:33,970
Speaker 1: The treasure is the historical record of the city that was buried.

579
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,857
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is a very LePon a plot.

580
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:39,370
Speaker 0: You're right, but he goes to this town and he's like, oh, it's an interesting plot.

581
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:48,229
Speaker 0: We must uncover it and basically he goes to this town and everyone in the town just asked him to solve puzzles all the time Which provides the game?

582
00:36:48,970 --> 00:37:01,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also people are disappearing and also people are disappearing or getting murdered and all sorts of things happen and you sort of Go around solving puzzles and the more puzzles you solve the more the plot is revealed to you.

583
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:02,867
Speaker 0: And that's that's pretty much the game.

584
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:06,344
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna reveal more of the plot than that because that would just.

585
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:07,530
Speaker 0: what's the point of playing then?

586
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's it's a halfway decent plot.

587
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:18,210
Speaker 0: The only thing I found wrong with the plot was that I figured out the rest of the plot about like A third of the way through the game.

588
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:22,415
Speaker 0: I said basically the town is fucked up in some way But you can't.

589
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:28,970
Speaker 0: it's like the town is weird and something is wrong But you don't know what and they don't tell you what until the end of the game.

590
00:37:29,432 --> 00:37:32,185
Speaker 0: I figured out what and I was right way early on.

591
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:33,070
Speaker 0: it's not hard.

592
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:36,269
Speaker 1: I'm curious if I'll figure it out at about the same point Scott did or not.

593
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:41,230
Speaker 0: Well, I figured I looked up in the corner when I figured it out and I had about 50 puzzles solved.

594
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:42,562
Speaker 1: So I'm nowhere near that.

595
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,334
Speaker 0: Okay, okay But yeah, I haven't.

596
00:37:45,414 --> 00:37:46,698
Speaker 1: I haven't done anything yet.

597
00:37:46,738 --> 00:37:49,225
Speaker 1: pretty much I got to town save the cat.

598
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:50,589
Speaker 1: some dude got axed.

599
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:56,430
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah No, and I have been ignoring the plot and pretty much searching the game for every possible puzzle.

600
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,518
Speaker 1: I can find it just completely ignoring the plot.

601
00:37:58,939 --> 00:38:04,121
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but yeah, it wasn't hard to figure out the plot But yeah that I guess that's the whole game right?

602
00:38:04,161 --> 00:38:07,589
Speaker 0: It's like it's the kind of game where you'll buy it You'll play it through once.

603
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:20,202
Speaker 0: Maybe you if you're you really like it You'll go through and try to find all the puzzles you missed because you can miss puzzles Like you sort of have to click on the screen to find the puzzles so some of them you might not click on and you don't have to.

604
00:38:20,443 --> 00:38:25,042
Speaker 0: you only have to beat like 70 or so puzzles to actually beat the game, you know, so

605
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:35,669
Speaker 1: but the game definitely does have a little bit of that adventure game point-and-click walk around look at stuff and Maybe this game will be a very slight step toward games like that coming back in a big way on the DS.

606
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:38,582
Speaker 0: Maybe there's gonna be a sequel to Layton already.

607
00:38:38,602 --> 00:38:40,250
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get it no matter what.

608
00:38:40,395 --> 00:38:47,390
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Now if you have a bunch of friends I'd highly recommend just because you know This is what you do one of you buy the game beat it and then just pass it around.

609
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,869
Speaker 1: There's no reason to own it after you've beaten it.

610
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, well there is one reason to own it after you've beaten it and that is there's a download option.

611
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:55,535
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the weekly puzzles.

612
00:38:55,796 --> 00:39:00,270
Speaker 0: basically you connect to the Wi-Fi and it'll download one new puzzle every week.

613
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,990
Speaker 0: I think they've already made all the puzzles.

614
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,754
Speaker 0: It's just they sort of.

615
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:05,730
Speaker 0: I guess their server like, you know delivers new ones weekly.

616
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:07,014
Speaker 0: So you connect.

617
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:12,290
Speaker 0: if you connect now don't worry about missing puzzles because it'll download every weekly puzzle that's been released so far.

618
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:16,650
Speaker 0: So you'll be alright and the weekly puzzle is just as good as the in-game puzzles.

619
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:17,447
Speaker 0: It's just more of them.

620
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:31,156
Speaker 1: Now if you're one of those people who won your parents have a DS or you want to get your parents a DS You pretty much want to get them a Sudoku or something because a lot of people like that and like brain training and cooking mama And this game.

621
00:39:31,216 --> 00:39:34,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is this is the game to get people who are not mad gamers.

622
00:39:34,952 --> 00:39:39,829
Speaker 0: The only thing wrong with this game is that it's a playthrough once and you're done game and maybe play a little bit more.

623
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:45,636
Speaker 0: You know redoing the puzzles is at least you know, if there was another Pitcher puzzle I could do it.

624
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:48,487
Speaker 0: But if it's the same pitcher puzzle again, it's like, okay.

625
00:39:48,507 --> 00:39:49,370
Speaker 0: I already know the answer.

626
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:58,410
Speaker 1: It's it's a waste of my yeah, but I mean at least even if like just some of the puzzles I mean that they're so varied that some require logic and some require just algebra.

627
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:01,769
Speaker 1: And if you're not good at algebra, you will have a hard time solving them.

628
00:40:02,354 --> 00:40:11,616
Speaker 0: One more thing is that some of the puzzles I disagreed with the wording of them like It's one that says something about you know Don't make a mirror image.

629
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:20,577
Speaker 0: and I came up with the answer and I'm like, I'm pretty sure this is the answer They're looking for and I was right but I claim that that answer was indeed a mirror image But they specifically said not to do.

630
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:23,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't run into anything really big like that yet.

631
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:32,934
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's also some of those like trick word puzzles The one that's like how many candles are left after blah blah blah Fuck that.

632
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:35,690
Speaker 1: I got that one right on the first try like two seconds.

633
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:37,841
Speaker 0: Oh, that was actually of all the puzzles in the game.

634
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:39,248
Speaker 0: I had the hardest time with that one.

635
00:40:39,388 --> 00:40:39,690
Speaker 0: Really?

636
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,541
Speaker 1: Yeah, literally I look at it.

637
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:45,996
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh duh beep You know what this is.

638
00:40:46,017 --> 00:40:48,027
Speaker 1: this is the best part of this game you realize.

639
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:51,961
Speaker 0: see the Reason that one got me is cuz okay.

640
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:54,690
Speaker 0: I know the answer is not the obvious answer, right?

641
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,930
Speaker 0: It's some clever answer and I came up with a clever answer.

642
00:40:58,231 --> 00:41:01,609
Speaker 0: But my answer was more clever than their clever answer.

643
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:06,284
Speaker 0: So there's no way I was gonna get their clever answer cuz I had a cleverer answer.

644
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,267
Speaker 0: What was your clever?

645
00:41:07,287 --> 00:41:12,324
Speaker 1: I Forget I'm curious cuz I don't think there was a cleverer answer.

646
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:16,838
Speaker 1: I forget there are Answers depending on how much you thought about it.

647
00:41:16,898 --> 00:41:17,581
Speaker 1: I know that much.

648
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:18,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, it makes sense.

649
00:41:18,986 --> 00:41:20,633
Speaker 0: It does make sense They're right.

650
00:41:20,654 --> 00:41:23,910
Speaker 0: I was wrong, but damn fuck them on that puzzle.

651
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:24,954
Speaker 1: but this is see.

652
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:40,890
Speaker 1: this is why this game is really fun cuz you're gonna play through it and you're gonna get some puzzles like That and some puzzles are gonna totally just wreck you and your friends gonna play it and they are Invariably going to wreck every puzzle you had trouble with but they are going to have had trouble with all the puzzles you read

653
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:41,853
Speaker 0: So far.

654
00:41:41,974 --> 00:41:46,752
Speaker 1: that's the case with us and it's that that will bring so much fun You can get.

655
00:41:46,953 --> 00:41:50,769
Speaker 1: you can all call each other stupid for weeks and weeks and weeks after you all play this game.

656
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:51,110
Speaker 0: here.

657
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:52,377
Speaker 0: I'll tell you one of the putt.

658
00:41:52,397 --> 00:41:54,530
Speaker 0: Here's an example of a tricky word puzzle, right?

659
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,879
Speaker 0: It was actually the most recent download.

660
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:57,582
Speaker 0: play puzzle.

661
00:41:57,662 --> 00:42:00,671
Speaker 0: So rim hasn't heard this one, probably so.

662
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:09,229
Speaker 0: an astronaut lands on a planet, right and there's there's all sorts of creatures living on the planet hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them, right.

663
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:12,810
Speaker 0: and So he starts he decides he's gonna count them, right?

664
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:15,093
Speaker 0: And there's like.

665
00:42:15,113 --> 00:42:23,903
Speaker 0: there's so many green ones and there's so many red ones and there's so many purple and they give you all these Numbers like there's two red ones and they multiply at this rate.

666
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:26,290
Speaker 0: and there's so many green ones and they multiply at this rate.

667
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:30,650
Speaker 0: You know, it's gonna take it, you know, he's gonna stand there and count for this long.

668
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:34,110
Speaker 0: How many will there be you know, like how many aliens are on the planet?

669
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:38,370
Speaker 0: And the answer is one because he's the alien he's on their planet.

670
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:42,370
Speaker 0: And I got that immediately and it was sort of boring.

671
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:47,535
Speaker 1: but that's actually one really good one that I liked was the one about Bacteria in a jar.

672
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:49,562
Speaker 1: and what if you start with two instead of one?

673
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:51,610
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that was a good one.

674
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,614
Speaker 0: There's a bunny one like that.

675
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:54,637
Speaker 0: Oh good.

676
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:58,307
Speaker 1: All you need anything can be accomplished with the power of love.

677
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:03,659
Speaker 1: Yeah Seriously though this game is fantastic.

678
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:06,110
Speaker 1: I have very little bad to say about it at all.

679
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,670
Speaker 0: The only thing is the game only has three save slots.

680
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,410
Speaker 0: So if you actually want your game to be saved you can only share it with two other friends.

681
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,641
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what do you care?

682
00:43:13,863 --> 00:43:14,226
Speaker 0: I don't know.

683
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:19,864
Speaker 0: There's also some unlucky stuff in the game like character sketches and what it seems corner.

684
00:43:19,924 --> 00:43:23,197
Speaker 1: Eh, yeah now on that note I mean, there's not much more to say about Leighton.

685
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:24,122
Speaker 1: I mean reviewing a game.

686
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:24,584
Speaker 1: That's good.

687
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:29,188
Speaker 1: It's always great The graphics are fine and the sound is great and the game is good and you should buy it.

688
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:30,192
Speaker 1: Thanks.

689
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:30,935
Speaker 1: Yep.

690
00:43:31,135 --> 00:43:33,202
Speaker 1: I mean we could do a final thoughts, but that would just be.

691
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:35,570
Speaker 1: ah, the plot was blah wasn't that great?

692
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,315
Speaker 0: Well plot was it was.

693
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:44,170
Speaker 0: it's a decent average plot better than a lot of other plots But not like some epic plot you'll remember for your entire life.

694
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:46,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I think we'll end it there.

695
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:51,210
Speaker 1: But I've there's something we've been meaning to do for a long time and I'm gonna start doing this every Tuesday for a while.

696
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:51,499
Speaker 1: All

697
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:51,686
Speaker 0: right

698
00:43:52,651 --> 00:44:00,850
Speaker 1: I'm sure all of you are gamers in some stripe and you're familiar with Dungeons and Dragons and I'm sure many of you who've listened to geek nights long enough are familiar with the burning wheel

699
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:02,103
Speaker 0: Burn away,

700
00:44:02,123 --> 00:44:05,622
Speaker 1: uh Basically, we're going to run for the next several weeks now.

701
00:44:05,662 --> 00:44:07,210
Speaker 1: I know that this is not advertising.

702
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:09,490
Speaker 1: We've not been paid in any way.

703
00:44:09,871 --> 00:44:13,502
Speaker 1: In fact at best we stalk the people who pull the person who makes burning wheel.

704
00:44:13,523 --> 00:44:14,686
Speaker 1: Well, it's friend you do.

705
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:18,344
Speaker 0: Yes, I do I'm just chillin.

706
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:30,006
Speaker 1: but uh Luke crane the man who made burning wheel and continues to work on burning wheel and he if ever there has been a person who would be described as a rock star of role-playing games.

707
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:42,015
Speaker 1: it is this man and I could contend that burning wheel is the best role-playing collaborative storytelling system in the world and We play it now in the front row crew.

708
00:44:42,076 --> 00:45:02,250
Speaker 1: and pretty much what I want to do is remind everyone every week for a while that if you have any Role-playing bones in your body if you even think you like Dungeons & Dragons or if you hate Dungeons & Dragons Because the demographic applies regardless You should buy the core books to burning wheel because it will revolutionize your world.

709
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:05,830
Speaker 0: I didn't even realize there's a third printing and we have actually an older printing.

710
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:09,490
Speaker 0: I feel like buying the new printing even though it's like if this isn't even change.

711
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,437
Speaker 0: This is like like, you know Like D&D is like three.

712
00:45:12,578 --> 00:45:14,850
Speaker 0: three and a half is sort of a significant change.

713
00:45:15,951 --> 00:45:16,493
Speaker 0: Change right.

714
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,843
Speaker 1: Scott and I are people who when D&D 3.5 came out.

715
00:45:20,405 --> 00:45:26,490
Speaker 0: We kept our old books Forever and then I bought the three and a half and then barely used it and regret buying three and a half.

716
00:45:26,574 --> 00:45:32,351
Speaker 1: Yeah But we kept the old books to the point that we had a lot of rules wrong and we just refused to upgrade and didn't Care.

717
00:45:32,432 --> 00:45:34,159
Speaker 0: and there was a big difference this.
