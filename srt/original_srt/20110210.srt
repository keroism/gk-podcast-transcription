1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,687
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, February 9th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:12,349
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:13,291
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,835
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,020
Speaker 0: Tonight, we talk about the Casa Play.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,148
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,577
Speaker 0: So lately in Midtown, there's been a ton of kind of like new lunch places that open.

8
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:34,425
Speaker 0: that are chains, but they're like a new chain.

9
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,553
Speaker 1: So it's like they're trying to be the next Chipotle?

10
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:38,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're trying to be the next Chipotle.

11
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:43,760
Speaker 0: It's very clear that they are and I've decided I like going to these places because they all kind of opened around the same time.

12
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:46,047
Speaker 1: I wish I had some of those places nearby.

13
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:49,579
Speaker 0: They're all not that great, but the thing is they all are like.

14
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:54,753
Speaker 0: they have managers and like all the staff are like crazily well like trained and they're super.

15
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:57,340
Speaker 0: shall I warm sirs crack pipe.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,969
Speaker 1: Oh, it is excellente.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,140
Speaker 0: Like I went into this one today.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,159
Speaker 0: So my goal is to eat at all these places.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,640
Speaker 0: One of them is a coffee shop and actually they had pretty good coffee that cost the same as Starbucks.

20
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:11,979
Speaker 0: And it's on the way to Starbucks so I can shave like 30 seconds off in my day.

21
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:14,066
Speaker 0: But anyway, I went to this place.

22
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:16,860
Speaker 0: it was called like for food with a number in it or two food.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,120
Speaker 0: I don't even remember but it was way weird.

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,010
Speaker 0: So I walk in and I can't.

25
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:23,539
Speaker 0: I look at the menu and I don't quite get it.

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,440
Speaker 0: It shows like these donuts, but it's a burger joint.

27
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:31,120
Speaker 0: But the menu is like what donut do you want and what do you want in the donut?

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,306
Speaker 0: And what do you want with the donut?

29
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:34,800
Speaker 0: All right, and then this guy in a suit walks over.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,366
Speaker 1: But I thought that you know, that's that's good.

31
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:37,893
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of donuts going on in the city.

32
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:38,616
Speaker 0: They're not donuts.

33
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:39,198
Speaker 0: They're beef.

34
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:42,129
Speaker 0: So, but so here's the thing.

35
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,796
Speaker 0: this guy walks over very well-dressed.

36
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:46,909
Speaker 0: he's like, "Sir, have you been to our fine establishment

37
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:47,231
Speaker 0: before?".

38
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,598
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Nah, I've never been

39
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:48,718
Speaker 0: here.".

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,857
Speaker 0: He's like, "I shall explain to you the many mysteries of our

41
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:52,300
Speaker 0: restaurant.".

42
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,620
Speaker 1: Why it looks like a donut, but is it?

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Speaker 0: And he proceeds to walk me through the menu.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,299
Speaker 0: He's like, "Basically, you build your own lunch.

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,820
Speaker 0: But the deal is our donut, our burgers are shaped like donuts and the burgers aren't just beef.

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,220
Speaker 0: They can also be chicken or hummus or whatever.

47
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:12,120
Speaker 0: It was like ten kinds and basically you go down the line and you pick an item from every column and it when it comes out at the end is a lunch.

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,360
Speaker 0: And like if you get a burger, it's like this donut shaped burger.

49
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,519
Speaker 1: So something goes in the middle?

50
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,081
Speaker 0: Yeah, you.

51
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:18,985
Speaker 0: so I got one.

52
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:22,460
Speaker 0: and the thing is if you can't if you're uncreative and you can't like figure it out.

53
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:25,160
Speaker 0: you can get their pre-made ones, but they all have names.

54
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,299
Speaker 0: One of them was "They's a-rapin' everybody" and it's it's a picture of that guy.

55
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:30,482
Speaker 1: What?

56
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:30,945
Speaker 1: Really?

57
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,060
Speaker 1: It's called "They's a-rapin' everybody"?

58
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,975
Speaker 0: It doesn't spell out a rape, but it is a. Okay in a restaurant, yeah the place and get this.

59
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:41,180
Speaker 0: all the seats had iPads.

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,680
Speaker 0: You can just like go on the internet with the iPad while you're eating.

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,500
Speaker 1: Hide your kids, hide your wife, don't go to that restaurant.

62
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,251
Speaker 1: And it was like 10 bucks.

63
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:48,076
Speaker 0: Like it was pretty good.

64
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:48,700
Speaker 0: The food was okay.

65
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:49,888
Speaker 0: But the deal was.

66
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:56,540
Speaker 0: I got this like beef burger donut on a brioche and inside of it was a cheese stick like melted into the middle.

67
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,464
Speaker 0: There's some jalapenos in it and and I got some fried potatoes and I I don't know.

68
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:03,370
Speaker 0: It was pretty good though.

69
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,778
Speaker 0: They clearly microwave everything behind the scenes.

70
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:07,663
Speaker 1: Mmm.

71
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:08,479
Speaker 1: Oh, you don't get to see?

72
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,338
Speaker 0: Nah, you don't get to see.

73
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,964
Speaker 0: But I don't know.

74
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:20,878
Speaker 0: it was kind of weird and I'm not sure if I like the place but the fact that they had a picture of "They's a-rapin' everybody" and named one of their burgers after.

75
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:21,320
Speaker 0: that was.

76
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:24,060
Speaker 0: It was most memorable.

77
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,200
Speaker 1: I would just go to the place that's been there for a while.

78
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,840
Speaker 1: That's meat on steak in a box with a miso soup and a rice.

79
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:32,160
Speaker 0: Thing is if I want stuff like that, I'll go one step further.

80
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,773
Speaker 0: I go to the Omsipie right by me and you can.

81
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:38,091
Speaker 0: they have like the fanciest rice balls and you buy like four rice balls and that's your dinner.

82
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:39,054
Speaker 0: Mmm.

83
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:40,439
Speaker 0: They're way big.

84
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,224
Speaker 0: Mmm.

85
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:42,138
Speaker 0: They're way good.

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:42,960
Speaker 0: Mmm.

87
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:46,719
Speaker 0: Or wait till you know if it's warm and I'll go over to Le Pen Côtillon again.

88
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,362
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

89
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:48,570
Speaker 0: I'm not walking over there now.

90
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:50,000
Speaker 0: It is a bit cold.

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,687
Speaker 1: There's one.

92
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:53,608
Speaker 1: it's oh my god It's so warm and like freaking.

93
00:03:53,809 --> 00:04:02,480
Speaker 1: last yesterday when I morning was so warm I was like, oh Or when we did the show and I was like you came over and you're like it is fucking cold out there.

94
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,720
Speaker 0: And I'm like, what are you talking about?

95
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,168
Speaker 1: And I was like the friggin.

96
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:07,220
Speaker 1: I was like the groundhog said early spring.

97
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,590
Speaker 1: So I'm like maybe right because they don't the grant.

98
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,253
Speaker 1: these is they?

99
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,920
Speaker 1: the groundhog doesn't see anything.

100
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,986
Speaker 0: They park the day on Groundhog Day.

101
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:18,519
Speaker 0: The first post was a photoshop of the groundhog dead covered in ice and everyone crying.

102
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,063
Speaker 1: Yeah Pretty much.

103
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:26,203
Speaker 1: the weathermen know if it's gonna be an early spring or not and then they tell the groundhog people whether it's yet It is or not.

104
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:31,900
Speaker 0: I read somewhere that they're pretty much like not statistically significantly over random.

105
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:32,623
Speaker 0: So I don't.

106
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:35,014
Speaker 1: I thought I thought that they were just more recently.

107
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:36,460
Speaker 1: They've been listening to whatever the weatherman.

108
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:36,944
Speaker 1: I don't know.

109
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:37,226
Speaker 0: I don't.

110
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:38,800
Speaker 0: I don't know if they actually do that or not.

111
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,724
Speaker 0: Well, who knows?

112
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:41,231
Speaker 1: who knows when they started doing it.

113
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,080
Speaker 1: We should look like one year at a time.

114
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:44,849
Speaker 0: So if I were them, you know what I would do.

115
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:47,000
Speaker 0: I would actually just do the groundhog thing.

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,162
Speaker 0: Whatever to.

117
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:50,130
Speaker 0: however the groundhog reacts is how I would do it.

118
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:51,174
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

119
00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:52,499
Speaker 1: But how can you tell?

120
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:53,963
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

121
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:57,479
Speaker 0: you set up a webcam and you put him in his hole and you just wait.

122
00:04:57,499 --> 00:05:01,632
Speaker 1: and How do you know if the groundhog sees a shadow or not?

123
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:03,940
Speaker 1: You it's not like the groundhog says to you.

124
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:04,971
Speaker 1: Oh, man, I see it.

125
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:05,356
Speaker 1: There it is.

126
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:05,640
Speaker 1: There it is.

127
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,022
Speaker 1: It is.

128
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:10,080
Speaker 0: you gotta come up with some sort of metric like once he comes out cuz the thing is he sees a shadow when?

129
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,919
Speaker 0: He runs away.

130
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:17,760
Speaker 0: So the first time he pokes his head out Does he get all the way out of the hole and walk off or does he go right the fuck back in that hole?

131
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:19,609
Speaker 0: That's what you do.

132
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:25,940
Speaker 1: Maybe make some sort of robotic groundhog thing is I imagine it would be pretty rare that he goes right back in that hole.

133
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,365
Speaker 1: and Also, what's to guarantee?

134
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:28,349
Speaker 1: He's gonna come out of the hole.

135
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might be frozen to death in there, right?

136
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:35,732
Speaker 1: Where does the groundhog even live don't they?

137
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,160
Speaker 1: isn't it like it in a zoo or something?

138
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,803
Speaker 0: but you were like.

139
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:41,345
Speaker 1: and then they just and then just carry it out to like the Town square.

140
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:41,969
Speaker 0: it's like a pet.

141
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,586
Speaker 0: I don't know but you were like, it's cold I'm like bullshit.

142
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:48,425
Speaker 0: and then I open the window after you left and Literally well one.

143
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:48,726
Speaker 0: I try.

144
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,490
Speaker 0: I heard this noise.

145
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,314
Speaker 0: I couldn't figure out what it was.

146
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:51,721
Speaker 0: then go to the window and I don't see Anything.

147
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,892
Speaker 0: I try to open the window and I can't like it won't open.

148
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:56,097
Speaker 0: It's frozen shut.

149
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:57,060
Speaker 0: No, it's not frozen shot.

150
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,814
Speaker 0: So I go to the balcony and I open that and the wind almost knocks me over.

151
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:04,110
Speaker 0: The wind was so strong I was crazy in my windows.

152
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it was so cold

153
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:11,640
Speaker 1: I was so I was like almost feeling like maybe biking will come soon, but then no punishment for even thinking that

154
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,585
Speaker 0: Just because

155
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:24,274
Speaker 1: I thought about bicycles it just punished me and was like, oh I hear Scott's thinking about bicycles - 50 degrees Friggin Tetris God and weather God hitting it up playing ping-pong.

156
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:25,820
Speaker 0: I mean, I like skiing.

161
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:42,833

163
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:56,419
Speaker 0: I'll let the bag out of the can But I got a phone call from the Philharmonic today interesting and they were like it was a recording but it was like.

169
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:28,229
Speaker 0: I don't know.

170
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:40,370
Speaker 0: I'm I'm digging this because I've been to symphonies in a lot of places But I feel like Lincoln Center is the one place where a hundred percent of the old etiquette about Concerts that people don't seem to goddamn know anymore.

171
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,594
Speaker 0: It's still in effect.

172
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,120

Speaker 1: Yeah, probably better be.

176

Speaker 1: I've been there.

177
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:54,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how they do.

178
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:06,411
Speaker 0: I was very disappointed when I paid hundreds of dollars a seat to go see a play not that long ago And it was you know, it was a really good play with big-name people in it and half The audience was basically wearing jeans the t-shirt.

179
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:06,773
Speaker 0: Yeah.

00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:08,320
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there's no dress code on Broadway.

181
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:12,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, but in this kind of show, I feel like I should have people should have dressed up.

182
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,612
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was disappointed.

183

Speaker 1: Swiss to Coster Swiss?

204
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:14,050
Speaker 1: So many holes through you Swiss.

205
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:20,052
Speaker 0: Okay I realized when I said it you automatically said cheese.

206
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:21,377
Speaker 1: I wanted to say cheese.

207
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:21,898
Speaker 0: Did you?

208
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,390
Speaker 0: Yes Are you sure that it wasn't some sort of neurolinguistic?

209
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,420
Speaker 1: Well, no cuz I wanted people to get the joke.

210
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,704
Speaker 1: They'd be like Swiss rim.

211
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:29,671
Speaker 1: What does that have to do with winning an outlaw?

212
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:32,080
Speaker 0: since when do we expect people to get the joke?

213
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,500
Speaker 1: It's because if he's Swiss cheese, I shot him full of holes.

214
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,667
Speaker 0: So is that your news?

215
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,560
Speaker 0: you want to talk about our outlaw exploits?

216
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,979
Speaker 0: I could talk about some news also because I mean we could play some combat or some maze craze or some spider-man.

217
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:54,249
Speaker 1: So anyway Sexism and anti-womanism in the video game world, especially the public online Multiplayer gaming world is not news.

218
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,680
Speaker 0: Don't forget racism a lot of racism.

219
00:09:57,101 --> 00:10:00,090
Speaker 1: Yeah racism, of course, right but sexism also right.

220
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,895
Speaker 1: just as much not news.

221
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,700
Speaker 1: It's been around it's gonna be around.

222
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:04,690
Speaker 1: It ain't going nowhere.

223
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:13,521
Speaker 1: All right, however You know and plenty of feminist gaming blogging people have written about it in the past many times most recently Dick Wolf scenario Etc.

224
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:13,822
Speaker 1: Etc.

225
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:14,244
Speaker 1: Etc.

226
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:14,525
Speaker 0: Yep.

227
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:17,214
Speaker 0: I mean we all know it's a problem and it I don't.

228
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:19,983
Speaker 0: we don't have any good ways to deal with It in the short term.

229
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:22,672
Speaker 1: However, so this I found a new thing.

230
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,559
Speaker 1: It's pretty new that is taken.

231
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,429
Speaker 1: I think what is the best approach to this ever right?

232
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:30,319
Speaker 1: and is a blog called fat ugly or slutty calm?

233
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,619
Speaker 0: and On this blog don't Google for that by the way.

234
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, go directly to fat ugly or slutty calm.

235
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:45,807
Speaker 1: They post not dot org screen captures and videos and audio captures but mostly just screenshots of Sexism in multiplayer online video games.

236
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:50,618
Speaker 1: So most of them are like pictures of Xbox Live messages and it's like, you know stuff.

237
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:55,739
Speaker 1: for example Hey if I bet you can I see you with a thong?

238
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:59,002
Speaker 0: Here's one Really?

239
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:04,056
Speaker 1: I'm going to travel back in time dot dot find a dinosaur egg dot dot.

240
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:13,403
Speaker 1: bring it back to the future Sit on it till it hatches raise it love it and then watch it mangle your lifeless and helpless carcass while I touch myself Inappropriately.

241
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,149
Speaker 0: that wasn't really sexist.

242
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:18,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, basically that was actually pretty good.

243
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,297
Speaker 0: These are things that you know, that was that was above the line.

244
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:22,820
Speaker 0: I don't know what to call.

245
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:32,940
Speaker 1: These are things that girls have received as messages while playing games online Messages like that and they don't like them and they post them in this blog and some of them are just you know examples.

246
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:39,076
Speaker 1: but This one so is I think the most quality right?

247
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:40,240
Speaker 0: Oh, wait, wait.

248
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:41,880
Speaker 0: So your news is hey.

249
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,868
Speaker 0: So there's this blog of the horrible sexist things.

250
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:46,698
Speaker 0: people say pause and here's the best.

251
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,894
Speaker 1: goddamn All right, cuz most of them are just like ah, oh, that's terrible.

252
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:52,560
Speaker 1: What is up with that disgusting person?

253
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,959
Speaker 1: But this one it's like, okay, even the comments on the blog are like, okay This guy gets points for being at least funny, right?

254
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:08,407
Speaker 1: Basically this guy is his avatar is the picture of the godfather and his username is pick a boss and he says Keep camping woman.

255
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:10,159
Speaker 1: I hope there's a kitchen in that tent.

256
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:16,395
Speaker 1: And one of the comments is even like man I want a tent with a kitchen in it.

257
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,345
Speaker 1: that's some high-tech shit And I was like hell.

258
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,153
Speaker 1: I want to get a tent with a kitchen in it.

259
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,660
Speaker 1: That is some high-tech shit.

260
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:34,413
Speaker 0: It does sad me though I mean I've been playing a lot of counter-strike lately and I I can literally tell you exactly how many women I have played Counter-strike with in the last I don't know six months.

261
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:45,000
Speaker 1: The answer is one Literally one and you know It's not the only reason but a big part of the reason is because of the things like you see on this here blog.

262
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:56,380
Speaker 0: What I what I really don't get and I want a term for it because there's like this sliding line of intelligence But there's sort of a black hole like a line below which I do not consider something that someone said online

263
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:57,664
Speaker 1: To be

264
00:12:57,684 --> 00:13:00,893
Speaker 0: in any way actually a comment like.

265
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:08,956
Speaker 0: it's not any more communication of any kind But some other thing kind of like how when I take a dump, I don't consider that communication.

266
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:10,140
Speaker 0: I consider it taking a dump.

267
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:11,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's.

268
00:13:11,103 --> 00:13:13,511
Speaker 1: it's weird that like, you know, I mean verbal dump.

269
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:16,040
Speaker 0: people post like I'm are you cocker?

270
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:27,223
Speaker 1: Right, it's like if I'm playing a game and someone's like fuck you Jew faggot rotten hell Negroes Fuck shit Strong.

271
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:30,073
Speaker 0: a bunch of words together and not your nouns and verbs like I don't.

272
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:36,400
Speaker 1: I don't even read it or process it Right, but it you know, these things apparently are upsetting many female gamers.

273
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:44,820
Speaker 0: Someone is like fuck you racist slur something at least they formed what is almost a coherent sentence.

274
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:47,570
Speaker 0: I feel like most of these and looking through that blog.

275
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,915
Speaker 0: It sounds like it's the case there too.

276
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:50,100
Speaker 0: They're below that.

277
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:56,680
Speaker 0: They don't even make sense in and of themselves like the words together in no order or combination.

278
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:58,779
Speaker 0: Actually conveys any message.

279
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:07,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of them but a lot of them are just like, you know I mean my evidence of this is look at the comments on YouTube like who who's posting that?

280
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,704
Speaker 0: Who's saying these things?

281
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,115
Speaker 0: Like I want to see the kid who is sitting there.

282
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:15,999
Speaker 0: He's 12, dude But I can't believe all 12 year olds are that way.

283
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:18,394
Speaker 0: How many is it?

284
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, I have some much more.

285
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:22,532
Speaker 1: So wait, there's one more.

286
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:24,881
Speaker 1: This is an example of a bad one Right.

287
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:32,220
Speaker 1: So king of lols whose avatar is mice Hughes is is clearly not okay says, how are you playing banette Bayonetta?

288
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,739
Speaker 1: There's no console in the kitchen.

289
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:37,032
Speaker 1: And then he says I can tell if a game is good just by looking at the cover.

290
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,960
Speaker 1: and it's unrealistic because how did the angels?

291
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,959
Speaker 1: Get in Bayonetta's kitchen in the first place?

292
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,833
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, see that's the kind of you know bad ones that are most of this site.

293
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,160
Speaker 0: at least it was still a complete sentence.

294
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:49,947
Speaker 0: I'll give it that.

295
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:51,259
Speaker 0: yeah kind of.

296
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,393
Speaker 0: So this will outrage you on a much more profound.

297
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:57,115
Speaker 0: love a new list.

298
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:57,877
Speaker 1: Love the outrage.

299
00:14:58,078 --> 00:14:58,700
Speaker 0: I love the outrage.

300
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,748
Speaker 1: You should make an outrage podcast.

301
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:01,751
Speaker 1: It's like outrage.

302
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:03,960
Speaker 0: You know, what grinds my gears.

303
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:07,797
Speaker 0: So this is a story from North America.

304
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:20,860
Speaker 0: It's from North Carolina, in fact North Raleigh And a citizen of the United States has been accused and there it looks like there will be a court case about that.

305
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,279
Speaker 0: There's an investigation a very suspect.

306
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:27,592
Speaker 0: He's been accused of practicing engineering without a license.

307
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:29,658
Speaker 1: Do you need a license to engineer?

308
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,446
Speaker 0: So Thus the problem.

309
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,254
Speaker 0: basically what happened here?

310
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:35,600
Speaker 1: I mean in a license to doctor?

311
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:40,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you need a license to be an auctioneer however and your license to drive a car?

312
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:42,585
Speaker 0: I believe a lot of those.

313
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:46,637
Speaker 0: they're all different situations, but consider the case of a doctor, right?

314
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:50,228
Speaker 0: I cannot Pretend to be a doctor unless I'm actually a doctor.

315
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:53,600
Speaker 0: I cannot go operate on someone unless I am a doctor, right?

316
00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:03,931
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what if I state an opinion that is related in some way to medicine just out in the open Like on my blog or something that's called freedom of speech.

317
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:05,920
Speaker 1: You just can't say that you're a doctor.

318
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:11,340
Speaker 1: You can't present it as medical advice just like you can't say this is legal advice.

319
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:13,620
Speaker 0: So you're expecting where the stories are gonna go.

320
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,639
Speaker 0: So here here's I'm gonna head you off.

321
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:17,786
Speaker 0: The deal was a city.

322
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:21,957
Speaker 0: North Raleigh was like we don't think we need to put a traffic light somewhere.

323
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:32,860
Speaker 0: like they decided they didn't Need signals at these two intersections and they hired an engineering firm which said you know gave their opinion that they weren't needed and The people in town basically said this is kind of bullshit.

324
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,703
Speaker 0: We don't agree with you.

325
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:43,460
Speaker 0: one of the guys in town who felt strongly about it who is not an engineer or anything Put together in a short simple eight-page document where he just stated his opinion.

326
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:55,253
Speaker 0: He showed map here quote eight-page document with maps diagrams and traffic projection Objections and he offered this to the city saying look I think we should have one regardless what that engineering firm says.

327
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:55,975
Speaker 0: Here's my opinion.

328
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:59,566
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And the city said we disagree with you.

329
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:13,477
Speaker 0: and to quote the article Lacey who is the chief traffic engineer for the state Department of Transportation Called the state licensing agency the new North Carolina Board of Examiners for engineers and surveyors to investigate him.

330
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:24,219
Speaker 0: because quote He filed the complaint because the report appeared to be engineering level work By someone who is not licensed as a professional engineer.

331
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:25,366
Speaker 1: At

332
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:46,357
Speaker 0: no point that this person claimed to be an engineer Claimed to be claimed to any of these things work as an engineer except money for all he did was state his opinion publicly and mail it to the city and the city's accusing him of Practicing engineering without a license not because he practiced engineering but because the opinion he gave quote appeared to be Well done.

333
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:50,196
Speaker 1: Well, you know if the court doesn't throw this out.

334
00:17:50,498 --> 00:18:01,880
Speaker 1: It's This sounds to me like who knows what the law for engineering license is looking out of that This is someone who claimed to be a lawyer actually said I'll paraphrase here claiming to be a lawyer.

335
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,642
Speaker 1: That's dangerous that

336
00:18:02,722 --> 00:18:19,720
Speaker 0: if you strictly read the law that the and those statutes and all the things that they're referring to which I couldn't Actually find online it basically forbids Anyone from observing any professional performing any service needed for the planning or completion of virtually any civic project for any?

337
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,300
Speaker 0: Evaluatory purposes whatsoever, even if it is only for a personal opinion.

338
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:30,520
Speaker 0: It also particularly cites if you use math or if you compare the work to drawings or plans.

339
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:32,372
Speaker 1: Well, that's clearly unconstitutional.

340
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,580
Speaker 1: First Amendment situation.

341
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,208
Speaker 0: Here's where this really bad.

342
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:36,153
Speaker 1: It's like cut and dry.

343
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:37,459
Speaker 0: I feel like this is a problem.

344
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:47,552
Speaker 1: You know I think it's pretty obvious that both that law and this person using that law are both Were created and do exist for the purposes of covering up corruption.

345
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:56,500
Speaker 1: the town didn't want to spend money on traffic lights So instead they spent a little bit less money to get some engineers to put a rubber stamp on that.

346
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,779
Speaker 1: You don't need traffic lights.

347
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,305
Speaker 1: so people call so that they would could save money.

348
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:08,860
Speaker 0: and it was just called this guy out on his bullshit and I have a quote from him when he was basically presented with the fact that this is a quote from the State Department of Transportation.

349
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:19,293
Speaker 0: Who's the bullshitter when you start applying the principles for trip generation and a route assignment Applying judgments from engineering documents and national standards and making recommendations.

350
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:21,859
Speaker 0: That's technical work that a licensed engineer would do.

351
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:24,763
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah That's his rationale.

352
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:35,735
Speaker 0: that because the guy was competent and intelligent and had basic reasoning skills That he does no longer have the right to freedom of speech I think this guy should run is an elected position to be head of the.

353
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:36,980
Speaker 0: I have no ID.

354
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:41,796
Speaker 1: Run for that position or further because you should vote for someone who will appoint him to that.

355
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:47,458
Speaker 0: because we have a problem in the US where we have free speech, but we restrict commercial speech and I agree with both of those.

356
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:52,980
Speaker 0: 100% Yeah, but we have a situation where there are a lot of this political speech.

357
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,160
Speaker 0: It's the first speech that there are things that are free speech that are regulated nonetheless.

358
00:19:57,242 --> 00:20:09,508
Speaker 0: for example it is very tricky as to whether like to what degree me saying my opinion on a law becomes giving legal advice and The Actual laws about that as I was trying to.

359
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:14,966
Speaker 1: it's only advice if you specifically say you should do this And you just say I believe this and the.

360
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:15,728
Speaker 1: this is the same.

361
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:25,006
Speaker 0: So here's the problem, but by that logic almost every senior IT engineer in the in America is breaking that on a regular basis.

362
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:35,994
Speaker 0: because one of the primary things that these people will do and none of them are lawyers is Give internal advice as to open source licensing Mm-hmm, and a lot of things are technically illegal under those sorts of regulations.

363
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:39,508
Speaker 0: and at least in this case I can say that I am an engineer.

364
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,300
Speaker 0: I've worked as an engineer for many many years.

365
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,656
Speaker 1: My title is currently needed a license to be an engineer in New York.

366
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:46,460
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

367
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:48,230
Speaker 0: But then again, maybe I could be wrong.

368
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:49,939
Speaker 0: Maybe you need one to be a civil engineer.

369
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,687
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't know I mean to be a civil engineer.

370
00:20:52,707 --> 00:20:55,260
Speaker 1: that actually would do something like actually survey a bridge.

371
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:56,928
Speaker 1: Sure, that's okay.

372
00:20:56,948 --> 00:21:04,720
Speaker 1: If you need a license to do that Yeah, but at the same time at the same time some guy just doing the actual surveying work for the bridge.

373
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:11,480
Speaker 0: She was just yes, but Scott what if I am NOT an engineer or surveyor, but it's my hobby.

374
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:20,264
Speaker 0: So I go out to the bridge I get the permission to do it You know pry pods and whatever and I survey the bridge on my own for fun and I put it on my blog That's fine.

375
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:24,197
Speaker 1: As long as we're not making the bridge or making adjustments to the bridge based on you.

376
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:25,020
Speaker 0: All right, so what?

377
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:35,591
Speaker 0: Problem According to some of these laws It looks like you could get in trouble if someone else unbeknownst to you use the information you publicly made available To then make a decision.

378
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:36,800
Speaker 1: Well that laws bullshit.

379
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,777
Speaker 1: They should get in trouble for using your information because that's would be copyright infringer.

380
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:41,238
Speaker 1: Would it not?

381
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:50,040
Speaker 0: Ah, perhaps but may but it using someone's information is not copyright infringement It's only if you redistribute it in its original form or in a replacement form.

382
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:58,053
Speaker 1: If you if I do a big report and that report is you know made available under a not, you know Depending on what license I make that available under.

383
00:21:58,073 --> 00:21:58,797
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess.

384
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:01,352
Speaker 1: no Mmm, I don't know.

385
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,639
Speaker 1: That's that's tough.

386
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:10,146
Speaker 1: Like if I if I architect a bridge and then you just I put my plans online You know, but it no.

387
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:20,420
Speaker 1: if you make the bridge that I made plans for and I put the plans online You're it would clearly be copyright infringement If you took my all rights reserved blueprints and copied them and gave them to everybody.

388
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:21,168
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a minor.

389
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:25,210
Speaker 1: if you make the bridge It's like if I make some sheet music and I put it online.

390
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,060
Speaker 1: right you you pass the sheet music around.

391
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:29,020
Speaker 1: That's copyright infringement.

392
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,087
Speaker 1: But what if you play the song?

393
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:34,600
Speaker 1: do I have any claim to that if you make a YouTube of you playing the song?

394
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,177
Speaker 1: That does not include the sheet music.

395
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:40,473
Speaker 0: There's a whole body of law that I'm not familiar enough.

396
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,176
Speaker 0: Well, you know what.

397
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:42,200
Speaker 1: so that would be the same thing.

398
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,705
Speaker 1: You know what?

399
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:46,020
Speaker 0: I Cannot legally give my opinion.

400
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:47,270
Speaker 1: I'm just saying this would be.

401
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,279
Speaker 1: that would be the same.

402
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:53,920
Speaker 1: It's the same situation legally as far as I see If I make blueprints and you build the bridge.

403
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:00,620
Speaker 0: That's not me saying so you can't publicly perform for example a cover of something unless you have the ASCAP licenses.

404
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:03,147
Speaker 0: Mmm, but there's a little update here.

405
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:10,731
Speaker 0: Andrew Ritter the executive director of the engineering licensing board in the state Said that it'll take three or four months to investigate this.

406
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:12,258
Speaker 0: but some follow-up here.

407
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:24,778
Speaker 0: It looks like The they admitted that they receive things like this all the time that the Department of Transportation Constantly receives this sort of thing from citizens who are pissed off about one or other decision they made.

408
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:35,400
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm This is the first time they've ever taken action against someone because the level the quality of the work was too high And that it appeared to be an unlicensed engineer as opposed to simply a concerned citizen.

409
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:36,546
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

410
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:40,993
Speaker 0: It's almost like they want to criminalize Smart yeah, yeah.

411
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:46,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but They should bust the people who Sort of agrees with this quote.

412
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:52,780
Speaker 0: He said there's a potential for violation of the Department of Transportation and the public were misled by quote.

413
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:58,799
Speaker 0: Engineering quality work unquote even if the authors did not actually claim to be engineers.

414
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:02,168
Speaker 0: All right, I'm done with my outrage.

415
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,130
Speaker 0: that's just yeah.

416
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:09,300
Speaker 0: I point this out because things like this happen pretty regularly And this is just one specific example.

417
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:17,320
Speaker 0: I happen to pick up from FARC and it does not get a lot of press and I don't know if I'll bother following up On it four months from now when I've forgotten and I have some new outrage.

418
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:23,399
Speaker 0: But you should be outraged and whenever if anything like this ever happens to you fight the goddamn fight to the end.

419
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,764
Speaker 1: Anti-intellectualism number one enemy.

420
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:37,131
Speaker 1: So with things over the day Man, so this thing of the day was all over the internet.

421
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:38,638
Speaker 1: So whatever I'm gonna show it to you.

422
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:44,860
Speaker 1: Anyway Some dude he told the story of Star Wars for you know, only he told it in icons.

423
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:47,547
Speaker 0: So it's all icons like nothing.

424
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,011
Speaker 1: but yeah, so it's there.

425
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:52,020
Speaker 1: It's well, it's it's a retold in icono scope.

426
00:24:53,121 --> 00:25:03,026
Speaker 1: So it's 32 lines long and each line is he's just little graphics with little pictures of droids and floppy disks and Luke's and lightsabers.

427
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:12,400
Speaker 0: Oh, you realize you realize that four thousand years from now Archaeologists are trying to piece pierce back to what happened during our century based on those hieroglyphics.

428
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:23,780
Speaker 1: Quite possible, but they would not be they might not last because they're in JPEG for So they may not survive and they also, you know may not have the JPEG cipher.

429
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:27,279
Speaker 1: They'll need the JPEG Rosetta Stone first.

430
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:38,992
Speaker 0: so There's a reason that we can't have nice things in America and partly it's that Because anyone who's smart gets in trouble for being a fake engineer.

431
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:43,508
Speaker 0: also because if anything is in a public space It eventually gets peed on and written on.

432
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:45,154
Speaker 0: that's true without exception.

433
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:49,431
Speaker 0: if it's in a public place long enough Don't forget pooped on the number and it is a function.

434
00:25:49,471 --> 00:26:02,140
Speaker 0: not just that it's it's how long something has been there And it's also a function of the number of human beings who encounter it on a daily basis on average Yep, and the higher those are you're guaranteed to have poop urine and graffiti.

435
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:09,402
Speaker 0: Yes, no matter what this is why we can't have capsule hotels because they would become hobo hotels, yep followed by poop hotels Yep.

436
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:11,791
Speaker 1: Well the other the other thing is that right?

437
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:14,320
Speaker 1: So in other countries, why don't they have hobo hotels?

438
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,322
Speaker 1: because if a hobo shows up they say get the fuck out of here hobo and they Are.

439
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:24,139
Speaker 0: or some countries have social safety nets that make sure the people who have mental problems that lead them living on the streets get the help they need.

440
00:26:25,222 --> 00:26:26,048
Speaker 1: Not that many though.

441
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,834
Speaker 1: a lot of plague in.

442
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:28,627
Speaker 1: you know in Japan There's plenty of homeless people.

443
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:32,280
Speaker 1: but if a homeless bum tries to go to a capsule hotel They'll just run them out of there and hit him with sticks.

444
00:26:33,623 --> 00:26:35,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, right in the US you can't do that.

445
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:44,320
Speaker 0: The other thing is that in general, I mean even if it's not hobos It's just stuff that's in public gets pissed on and written on people got a pee.

446
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:48,505
Speaker 1: Well, I think a real solution to be the peeing is Public bathrooms.

447
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then they get full of hobo.

448
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,772
Speaker 0: So the New York City subway is one of the best subways in the world.

449
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:59,038
Speaker 0: the only factor it lacks is Cleanliness.

450
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:01,169
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it's so old.

451
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:02,173
Speaker 1: it used to be clean.

452
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:03,860
Speaker 0: It is relatively clean.

453
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,400
Speaker 0: It's just that it's not that pretty on the inside.

454
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:11,072
Speaker 0: Meanwhile Sweden, this is some awesome shit.

455
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,620
Speaker 0: Here are just a bunch of pictures of subway stations in Sweden.

456
00:27:14,742 --> 00:27:24,700
Speaker 0: I don't know what strikes me more the fire red sky painting on the rock the Classical statues carved into the bedrock from which the subway was wrought.

457
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:30,056
Speaker 0: Maybe the giant Tolkien s column that was built just in the middle for fun.

458
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:31,380
Speaker 1: Well, Sweden's totally metal, right?

459
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,294
Speaker 0: So yeah, there's the statue that looks like it's Odin or Thor or something.

460
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,900
Speaker 0: There's a Pac Man ghost.

461
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,658
Speaker 1: Well, you know, yeah, you know goes to vote.

462
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,791
Speaker 0: Also, it's clean enough to where I would know.

463
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,580
Speaker 1: you think you think you're Clyde.

464
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:47,037
Speaker 0: I would not feel that uncomfortable rolling around naked in here.

465
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:49,380
Speaker 1: Is it Clyde?

466
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:53,933
Speaker 1: You want to roll around naked with Clyde?

467
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:54,537
Speaker 1: is that what it is?

468
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:59,780
Speaker 0: But before we move on the meta moment always important the book club book is still Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

469
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,845
Speaker 0: God has to finish reading it.

470
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:02,572
Speaker 0: Have you finished reading it?

471
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:02,913
Speaker 1: Nope.

472
00:28:03,134 --> 00:28:04,139
Speaker 0: Will you finish reading it?

473
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:07,270
Speaker 1: I figure we just did a book club.

474
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,034
Speaker 1: I give it some time.

475
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:08,919
Speaker 1: I didn't want to rush it.

476
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:10,918
Speaker 0: What are we gonna put the book club site up?

477
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,911
Speaker 0: When I'm not lazy I did all that data entry.

478
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:19,010
Speaker 1: My problem is I got too many things I'm working on and I haven't.

481
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:25,138
Speaker 0: I don't have a whole hour to do it.

482
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:32,918
Speaker 1: There's an old saying in the computer world the first 90% of the work takes 90% of the time and the last 10% of the work takes the other 90% of the time.

483
00:28:34,401 --> 00:28:37,131
Speaker 1: So I've done the first 90% of the work for like a hundred things.

Speaker 0: You've noticed all the people coming into the forum.

518
00:30:25,662 --> 00:30:27,691
Speaker 0: It's not because of our show at magfest.

519
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,540

525
00:30:43,637 --> 00:30:44,420
Speaker 1: They'll be quality video.

526
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:52,828
Speaker 0: Well, I do have a real 1080p 60 frames a second awesome HD camera sitting in front of me right now that I'm still learning How to use.

527
00:30:52,848 --> 00:31:01,062
Speaker 1: yeah You spend a lot of money and then it's like you get to buy fancy golf clubs and you still hit it way out Into the woods.

528
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:08,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see we'll get there and I bought a thousand dollar golf club instead of $100 golf club And it's in the water, but you gave me shit about buying skis.

529
00:31:08,354 --> 00:31:09,500
Speaker 0: You're like, how much do you ski?

530
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,959
Speaker 0: I calculated that they've already saved me a few hundred dollars.

531
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:15,670
Speaker 1: Ski rental is a ripoff.

532
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:16,980
Speaker 0: Not really a rental.

533
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:20,814
Speaker 0: I mean 30 bucks for a day of skiing including the sizing and the liability and everything.

534
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,159
Speaker 1: and how much is a ski?

535
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,207
Speaker 1: 200 bucks, right?

536
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:27,520
Speaker 1: So if you ski like seven times, yeah, you're good.

537
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:33,256
Speaker 0: However, if you don't take care of your skis, they will suck long before you have skied seven times.

538
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:34,700
Speaker 1: really they wear out that fast.

539
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:37,595
Speaker 0: No, it's more that they'll like rust and you probably won't know how to wax.

540
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:38,359
Speaker 1: They're made of metal.

541
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,505
Speaker 0: There's edges that are metal.

542
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:45,163
Speaker 1: I thought they were made out of either wood or some sort of composite Situation.

543
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:48,819
Speaker 0: they're made out of some composite with a wood or metal core.

544
00:31:49,482 --> 00:31:51,630
Speaker 0: But the bottom surface is something called p-tex.

545
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:54,240
Speaker 0: p-tex which is it soaks up wet.

546
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:55,891
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into it.

547
00:31:55,911 --> 00:32:01,266
Speaker 0: suffice to say Kind of kind of yeah Basically, I've learned I started.

548
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:05,946
Speaker 0: I'm at the point where I wax my own skis and I do like all my own stuff and I can Tell the difference now.

549
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:07,819
Speaker 1: Wait, so you put the wax on the bottom of the ski?

550
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,886
Speaker 0: Yeah on top of the p-tex and then it melts into the p-tex And I got a melted in.

551
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:18,320
Speaker 0: I use a hairdryer and an iron and all this - anyway, that's crazy.

552
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:19,544
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah geek nights.

553
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:21,371

Speaker 0: We kick people out who can't enjoy.

558
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:26,894
Speaker 1: I'm saying the meta moments over.

559
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:27,778
Speaker 0: It's not it's over.

560
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:28,499

00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,040
Speaker 1: It's still seeing an increase.

566
00:32:44,081 --> 00:32:45,080
Speaker 0: It's something that you know.

567
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,300
Speaker 0: You'd think oh this should be an anime show because you always see this at the anime cons.

568
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:50,431
Speaker 0: You see it just as much of the gaming cons.

569
00:32:50,732 --> 00:32:52,180
Speaker 0: You see it at football games.

570
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:53,832
Speaker 0: You see it just in the street.

571
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:54,860
Speaker 0: You see it at parties.

572
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:55,904
Speaker 0: This is actually.

573
00:32:55,924 --> 00:32:59,278
Speaker 0: it's everywhere in geek culture and in non geek culture.

574
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:02,688
Speaker 0: Yep Of course, we're talking about the Casa play.

575
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:05,476

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,674
Speaker 1: Well, there's all the costume making and the costume wearing.

578
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:10,639
Speaker 1: are they the same right?

579
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:13,627
Speaker 1: Play only referred to the costume.

580
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:17,660
Speaker 1: not even it's just that cosplay is actually would isn't that a subset of costume wearing?

581
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:23,960
Speaker 1: Not only are you wearing it, but you're also acting in the character or actually performing a play as that character?

582
00:33:24,322 --> 00:33:27,660
Speaker 0: Yep, of course, then there's if you want to get to the anime stuff they get all the way down to well.

00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:30,819
Speaker 0: is it the masquerade or the costume contest or the?

584
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:36,580
Speaker 1: Well, the costume contest judges craft the cross to making skills, right?

585
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,256
Speaker 1: But the costume, you know masquerade counts your cosplaying skill.

586
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:49,019
Speaker 0: Well, it counts Never mind I I am so sick of those events that it's almost painful to talk about.

587
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,400
Speaker 0: there's this guy.

588
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know I don't know how much you have this problem.

589
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:59,185
Speaker 0: But I mean when I put on my first suit the zipper always Lose some weight.

590
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:04,726
Speaker 1: I Get the thing with cosplay right.

591
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:10,141
Speaker 1: is that you know, it's a legitimate geekery just as every other geekery is legitimate geekery Right.

592
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:13,900
Speaker 1: We want people to participate in as many geekeries as is possible.

593
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,900
Speaker 1: We have no, you know, and I geek nights.

594
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:19,455
Speaker 1: We love all geekeries, even if we personally don't like them like.

595
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,699
Speaker 1: I personally don't like Star Trek.

596
00:34:21,202 --> 00:34:26,480
Speaker 1: But if someone likes Star Trek, I want them to be a Star Trek geek, you know, embrace the geek domes.

597
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,485
Speaker 0: I think whatever you are maybe are Unreadable.

598
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:38,047
Speaker 0: I also think Harry Potter is Awful, it is painful for me to attempt to read Harry Potter Magic by Neil Gaiman.

599
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:41,498
Speaker 0: instead that writing is like knives into my eyes.

600
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:46,800
Speaker 1: I weep but you know whether we like or don't like cosplay, right?

601
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:54,940
Speaker 1: there are many people who like or don't like cosplay or cosplayers or typical cosplayers or stereotypes of cosplaying.

602
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,051
Speaker 1: But that doesn't mean that it's no good.

603
00:34:58,152 --> 00:34:59,879
Speaker 1: or it should go away or we should get rid of it.

604
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:06,244
Speaker 1: No We should have as many geekeries as we can possibly get and we should get as many geeks as we can possibly get no matter what their geekeries may be.

605
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:21,180
Speaker 0: what's funny is that as a kid like the only cons I went to were basically small gaming cons like Michicon and Renaissance fairs and land parties, I guess and as a result, I never really saw a costume culture.

606
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,008
Speaker 0: I mean Renaissance fair.

607
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:23,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone's in a costume.

608
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:31,915
Speaker 0: I don't think I ever saw anyone in a costume at a gaming con as a kid except for always without Exception that one fat guy in chainmail.

609
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:41,552
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm The thing with cosplay right is when I was young costumes are pretty much for Halloween or for you know I guess like Broadway shows and things like that right there were.

610
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:46,819
Speaker 1: costumes weren't for anything else, you know I guess maybe also amusement parks that be the costumed characters, right?

611
00:35:47,500 --> 00:36:00,878
Speaker 1: but you know early on the first anime cons I went to like Ohio con and for Otacon 02, right The cosplay was interesting to me then because it was like most.

612
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,870
Speaker 1: for me At least the enjoyment was holy crap.

613
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:06,220
Speaker 1: That guy is in a costume.

614
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:09,920
Speaker 1: That is not a cut that you can't see that costume anywhere.

615
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,360
Speaker 1: It's like, you know that guy's dressed up as something obscure that there is no costume you can buy in a box.

616
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:15,741
Speaker 1: He's like.

617
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:16,524
Speaker 1: he's not dressed up.

618
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:26,340
Speaker 1: as you know, a Ninja Turtle like I was for Halloween stuff is vampire hunter D. Right, and oh my god, he actually it's a high-quality costume actually looks like vampire hunter D. That's so awesome.

619
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:31,930
Speaker 1: Or there was also the awesomeness of oh my god That cosplay is so clever and hilarious.

620
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,099
Speaker 1: if I put a picture of that on the internet people will lol.

621
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:35,364
Speaker 0: I Jewish wolf would.

622
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:37,773
Speaker 0: I was about to say Jewish wolf would pretty much wins that.

623
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:42,893
Speaker 0: all other things with him aside The one time he did that cosplay was also been on this show.

624
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:44,157
Speaker 0: He was on this show.

625
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:49,235
Speaker 0: Yeah We interviewed him about and some bullshit.

626
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:51,820
Speaker 0: Otacon drama in fact Yeah, whatever.

627
00:36:54,921 --> 00:37:03,136
Speaker 1: So anyway see that for me that was the enjoyment of seeing cosplays was ones that were clever Ones that were like high quality like wow, look at that.

628
00:37:03,176 --> 00:37:03,920
Speaker 1: That's pretty awesome.

629
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:08,600
Speaker 1: Look in you know, or just you know, this the sheer novelty factor of wow, that's a costume.

630
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:09,880
Speaker 1: You're not gonna see that anywhere.

631
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:15,200
Speaker 0: Yeah It wasn't until RIT that I was like, oh man cuz I always liked wearing costumes like when I was in high school.

632
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,560
Speaker 0: I dress up as something go to Halloween party and then I rarely had cause to ever put on a costume.

633
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:27,420
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not so big a fan of wearing a costume mostly because a lot of costumes are uncomfortable, right?

634
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:36,240
Speaker 1: Especially if there's some sort of like, you know strange Accessories involved or for like face paint, you know, it was always gonna get you all greasy and blend.

635
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:45,199
Speaker 1: You got to wash it off, you know and that sort of stuff depending on the costume, you know Some costumes are just regular clothes and those costumes I don't have that problem with because they're just regular clothes.

636
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:51,204
Speaker 0: But going to these cons mostly was that it was all girls dressed up and they were really cute a lot of cat girls and Sort of things.

637
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:53,255
Speaker 0: I was digging it already when you're very young.

638
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,753
Speaker 0: Yeah I was like 19.

639
00:37:56,753 --> 00:38:00,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now that's kind of scary because you're like 28 and there's then they're like 14.

640
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, uh, it was better when I was 19 and they were also 19.

641
00:38:04,232 --> 00:38:06,500
Speaker 1: It was those days are over.

642
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:13,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, I used to go to the masquerades too because back then I watched a few simulcast Yeah, but I mean I went to like anime central.

643
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:17,380
Speaker 0: I went to them and they were enjoyable to a degree.

644
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:25,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the thing with the masquerade right which is separate at least You know at an anime con is that these people are putting on skits most of the time, right?

645
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:32,200
Speaker 1: If you're walking across the stage It's pretty much the same as the hallway stuff except the fact that some people bring out the big guns just for that.

646
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:39,667
Speaker 0: So I realized something the skits are not worse than they were then but the masquerades are And I think how is that?

647
00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:46,798
Speaker 1: so I've realized this because I mean the skits were always usually really bad Always be one or two that had something good about.

648
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:47,079
Speaker 1: yes.

649
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:48,626
Speaker 0: So here's what's different.

650
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:54,250
Speaker 0: every masquerade I ever went to back when I went to masquerades The whole thing was actually really short.

651
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,957
Speaker 0: It was like a half-hour 45 minutes time.

652
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:56,963
Speaker 1: I don't know.

653
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:58,699
Speaker 1: the Otakon ones are always at least an hour.

654
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,905
Speaker 0: I never went to the fucking Otakon ones.

655
00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:03,768
Speaker 1: I saw the simulcast while I was waiting for some horrible movie to start I knew better.

656
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:05,080
Speaker 0: I didn't go to the Otakon ones.

657
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:11,934
Speaker 0: I went to the ones all these other anime cons that were smaller and they were like a half hour And every skit was like two or three minutes and they were all stupid.

658
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:23,484
Speaker 0: They all had time limits on them Yeah, and just because there were less of them The novelty was enough to where you could enjoy it, but I can't sit through two hours of the same gay joke Mmm.

659
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:25,716
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I think you know the same.

660
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:34,236
Speaker 0: Oh shit We talk really badly and we're not actually acting and then we do the caramel dance and I think part of the.

661
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:37,920
Speaker 1: you know The part of the problem that they're so bad is that they have at simultaneously.

662
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:41,460
Speaker 1: They have too many limitations and also not enough limitations, right?

663
00:39:41,842 --> 00:39:44,960
Speaker 1: They limit them in ways that restrict them from beat.

664
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,079
Speaker 1: They keep them from being quality and creative like you can't futz with the lighting, right?

665
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:58,179
Speaker 1: So I couldn't do a skit that involved like a spotlight that follows someone and then turn all the lights on and then do a blue Color, you know, yeah, so it's basically everything's lit all at once.

666
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:04,780
Speaker 1: So you can't even do like, you know Keep the something in the dark while you rearrange a set piece or anything like that, right?

667
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:10,399
Speaker 1: See it that really restricts the quality of your production if you can't even control the lights or anything like that.

668
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:26,240
Speaker 1: And because there are so many problems of people not being able to like use microphones Properly or project their voice properly they a lot of cosplays I know do stuff where it's like you have to provide an audio file of your audio and You don't get to talk on a microphone.

669
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,902
Speaker 1: There aren't any.

670
00:40:26,942 --> 00:40:29,753
Speaker 1: so you just had to do your skit in sync with this audio.

671
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:32,845
Speaker 1: if that involves lip syncing or whatever I think it's easy to fix.

672
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:39,398
Speaker 0: and if I ran if I was ahead of cosplay at a big con like Otacon I would have this shit down so fast because I learned a lot.

673
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:54,257
Speaker 0: running You know the first spring cosplay at our IT anime back in the day doing our costume contest and everything and I realized if I Were Otacon or some big anime con what I would do is All year if you've got to send in a video an audition and I would pick they don't

674
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:56,109
Speaker 1: have those though But they do them at the con.

675
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would do this ahead of time.

676
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:00,944
Speaker 0: You have to send a video like a four months Deadline ahead of the con.

677
00:41:01,386 --> 00:41:06,764
Speaker 0: we will pick the best 10 or 15 or so and then work with them directly To have.

678
00:41:06,845 --> 00:41:09,220
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even I wouldn't even set a number, right?

679
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,757
Speaker 1: I would say we're only gonna pick the ones that are good enough and if it's zero, it's zero now.

680
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:14,380
Speaker 0: that doesn't work.

681
00:41:14,702 --> 00:41:17,080
Speaker 0: That's actually kind of a bad way to handle it.

682
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,662
Speaker 0: Why is it?

683
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:18,968
Speaker 1: we're all gonna be terrible anyway.

684
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,647
Speaker 0: now if you set it up like that the first couple years They'd be pretty slim pickings.

685
00:41:22,687 --> 00:41:25,583
Speaker 0: But then while you'd lose the Shitty.

686
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:26,847
Speaker 0: Oh wait, there's no bad drawback.

687
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:27,429
Speaker 0: It's perfect.

688
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,199
Speaker 0: It just requires more work on the part of the staff.

689
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,111
Speaker 1: Which yeah anyway, no, but the thing is right.

690
00:41:33,131 --> 00:41:35,120
Speaker 1: here's why I don't have confidence in this plan.

691
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,690
Speaker 1: Right is because look at cosplay chess.

692
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,280
Speaker 1: cosplay chess is that thing?

693
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,316
Speaker 1: Basically, these people will actually meet and prepare all year for this cosplay chess.

694
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,420
Speaker 1: They write it and prepare.

695
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:49,427
Speaker 1: It's still terrible.

696
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:53,807
Speaker 1: play chess is like four hours long Even if it was only ten minutes long.

697
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:57,280
Speaker 1: these people practice and prepare for us so long and it's doesn't it?

698
00:41:57,521 --> 00:41:59,250
Speaker 0: It's not good in the end or how about this?

699
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:06,320
Speaker 0: you do the same masquerade as always But then at the end of it you show the three best skits from the separate.

700
00:42:06,722 --> 00:42:15,399
Speaker 0: Send us a submission if you want to be the real people that get real microphone skits Mmm, so you have like the real ones like like real tear and shit tear and you separate the two.

701
00:42:16,143 --> 00:42:18,859
Speaker 1: I guess you could do something like that, but it's not gonna help that much right?

702
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,800
Speaker 0: No, well the root problem and I don't want to dwell on this much more is that people eat that up.

703
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:28,521
Speaker 0: You know, you know, we had a lot of feedback from Connecticut last year and very true You know.

704
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:34,863
Speaker 0: people said the panels were the best they'd ever seen at Connecticut and they notified us of all the problems We already knew existed.

705
00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:46,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like everything was great, but half of the positives we got were specific awesome panels that we agreed were awesome and the whole other half were Cosplay chess is the best thing ever.

706
00:42:46,494 --> 00:42:49,919
Speaker 0: Oh my god, and I've seen cosplay chess.

707
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:52,398
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

708
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,806
Speaker 1: People just like that shit.

709
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:55,991
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

710
00:42:56,132 --> 00:42:57,920
Speaker 1: I don't get it either but they like it.

711
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,385
Speaker 1: So let him have it.

712
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:01,895
Speaker 0: I say let him have it too, but I didn't.

713
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:07,524
Speaker 0: I was forcing me to watch it But remember, I mean we used to have to judge Costume contests.

714
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:07,987
Speaker 0: I've done it.

715
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:09,716
Speaker 1: I've done it a couple times at RIT anime.

716
00:43:09,736 --> 00:43:13,259
Speaker 0: We had to do it Yeah, and at sitcom we were actually the celebrity judges.

717
00:43:14,584 --> 00:43:29,502
Speaker 0: That was awkward because they do their skit and then we as the judges and there were like three or four other people on the Panel would have to like ask them questions on stage and some of them were okay And some of them were really sad and it was really hard to come up with questions.

718
00:43:29,582 --> 00:43:35,980
Speaker 1: for the thing is I don't know why we were doing that because I've never seen anyone ask questions of a skit at a Another cosplay besides that one.

719
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,185
Speaker 0: well Because we're no to con they go up to do their skit they get off because they didn't have that many and it was a small Con and we were supposed to all be funny.

720
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:43,610
Speaker 1: No, okay, whatever.

721
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:54,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean for the six people in the audience it definitely was Yeah, we did cosplay like for real only once ever at.

722
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,138
Speaker 1: Well, we've also there was you know, the RIT anime Club had an annual costume.

723
00:43:58,198 --> 00:44:02,760
Speaker 0: Oh my god I was famous for my half acid not even half ass.

724
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:07,565
Speaker 0: It was like an eighth of an ass was what I put into that cuz I had no money I had no time.

725
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:09,272
Speaker 1: the the oh my god is cosplay.

726
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:10,919
Speaker 0: I think that was the best one.

727
00:44:11,664 --> 00:44:17,818
Speaker 1: No, no that when I took our curtains I wrapped around And then you had a piece of felt that you turn that you rotated 90 degrees.

728
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,727
Speaker 1: So it was now a diamond right?

729
00:44:19,808 --> 00:44:28,560
Speaker 0: So there's a triangle in the front a triangle in the bag and I glued it And I put that over my shoulders and then I glued up like a diamond of felt to my forehead and I wore white pants.

730
00:44:28,962 --> 00:44:31,112
Speaker 0: Yep, I didn't even get to shave that day.

731
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:31,936
Speaker 0: It looked awful.

732
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:33,744
Speaker 1: Yeah even I did the.

733
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:47,144
Speaker 1: I did the initial D car which is a car made out of poster board that I attached two LEDs to the front and Put some straps so I could wear it over my shoulders and it might still be in the anime club library somewhere Maybe they?

734
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:48,229
Speaker 0: we that was lost.

735
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:49,313
Speaker 0: I heard was it?

736
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:50,096
Speaker 1: they lost god.

737
00:44:50,116 --> 00:44:50,940
Speaker 1: They lost my car.

738
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:52,044
Speaker 0: I heard the car is gone.

739
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,249
Speaker 1: work so hard to make that car.

740
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,017
Speaker 0: a lot of the things we'd left behind are gone.

741
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:56,786
Speaker 0: my car I did the one.

742
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:57,369
Speaker 0: what's his name?

743
00:44:57,389 --> 00:44:59,380
Speaker 0: the guy the sniper guy from?

744
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,578
Speaker 0: 8.

745
00:45:01,578 --> 00:45:08,259
Speaker 0: I Dressed up as him because I had the trench coat add the hat but one I lost the hat so I couldn't wear it.

746
00:45:08,903 --> 00:45:10,375
Speaker 0: So my costume was half-assed.

747
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:17,663
Speaker 0: to that point I basically took my trench coat taped some fake fur around the neck and then to make his shirt I took.

748
00:45:17,964 --> 00:45:25,749
Speaker 0: I bought a square of felt and I made the front half of a shirt because I couldn't afford enough felt to also Make the back half and I duct-taped it to my chest.

749
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:34,340
Speaker 1: one time the anime club people decided to do star ocean And I knew nothing about star being Greg dressed up as the dragons that stand on either side of the guy.

750
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,379
Speaker 0: Yep, so I wore a red suit.

751
00:45:36,641 --> 00:45:40,877
Speaker 0: He wore a blue suit and we taped signs written in marker to our chest.

752
00:45:40,897 --> 00:45:43,920
Speaker 1: that said dragon Yeah, and I was supposed to be some character.

753
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:54,586
Speaker 1: I don't even know what the character was and we basically went to the you know the goodwill and they're like bought a white shirt and a vest and then I wore rims trench coat and yeah, I guess people said That that was the character.

754
00:45:54,606 --> 00:45:55,068
Speaker 1: I'm like, okay.

755
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:56,959
Speaker 1: I don't even know this character's name or anything.

756
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:59,839
Speaker 1: Whatever they decided on star ocean theme.

757
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:07,692
Speaker 0: Ah, but at that one Otacon we got a whole bunch of the front row crew like ten or so people To dress up as the axe gang.

758
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:08,999
Speaker 1: It was actually is pretty good.

759
00:46:09,323 --> 00:46:10,539
Speaker 1: I realized we did a good job.

760
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,567
Speaker 0: Exactly why people cosplay icons?

761
00:46:12,587 --> 00:46:17,571
Speaker 0: because basically what it means is everybody's paying attention to you Even though you might not deserve it.

762
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:22,460
Speaker 1: Our costume was not that great No, but but there was some cleverness to it and that we actually had a gang.

763
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:25,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the axe gang was sort of an obscure thing.

764
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,655
Speaker 1: So the people who are new to cons or whatever were like, oh my god There's people dressed up as a thing that you'll never see.

765
00:46:30,695 --> 00:46:31,300
Speaker 1: people dressed up.

766
00:46:31,461 --> 00:46:34,880
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the axe gang and we were doing the dance and we had little axes.

767
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:35,584
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had.

768
00:46:35,604 --> 00:46:37,453
Speaker 1: we bought little axes from like the dollar store.

769
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:41,673
Speaker 0: Those are actually hard to find Really little plastic axes.

770
00:46:41,693 --> 00:46:42,780
Speaker 1: We bought the fireman's kit.

771
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:54,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was that one fireman set and we bought all the ones that they had at the KB toys by RIT And we got someone else who would live further away You know, we could get a whole bunch of those at the KB toys in Atlantic City.

772
00:46:56,805 --> 00:46:57,899
Speaker 0: But that was good times.

773
00:46:58,402 --> 00:47:03,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it on the one hand right it was kind of annoying because it was really hot in the summer and the costume Was very warm.

774
00:47:04,045 --> 00:47:07,080
Speaker 1: right because it was actual dress clothes and not shorts and a t-shirt.

775
00:47:07,844 --> 00:47:13,933
Speaker 1: And also, you know, it's like if you want attention Congratulations, you've got attention and people are taking pictures of you if that's what you wanted.

776
00:47:13,953 --> 00:47:14,936
Speaker 1: Awesome.

777
00:47:15,077 --> 00:47:21,780
Speaker 1: You win, but Basically, you can't walk anywhere because people keep stopping you and asking you to take the picture and you're blocking the hallway and it's terrible.

778
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,340
Speaker 1: All right It's kind of you actually want to do something at the con.

779
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:30,845
Speaker 1: You can't do it while wearing a costume even if the classroom was normal clothes which it was in that case.

780
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:33,939
Speaker 0: Scott made this rule and I agree with it a hundred percent and we needed to spread.

781
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:44,809
Speaker 0: if Anyone at a convention ever blocks a hallway to take a picture or is causing a physical space Disruption because they have a space clear to take a picture.

782
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:48,962
Speaker 0: Just walk right through they have no right or excuse to block the hall Like that.

783
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:50,689
Speaker 0: just walk right through their picture.

784
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:51,432
Speaker 0: Just don't even care.

785
00:47:51,673 --> 00:47:53,300
Speaker 0: I feel like everybody needs to start doing that.

786
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they're in an aisle or whatever.

787
00:47:55,147 --> 00:47:58,660
Speaker 1: if they're you know, do not allow someone to use walking space for picture.

788
00:47:59,884 --> 00:48:03,134
Speaker 1: In Japan they say there's no picture-taking allowed inside.

789
00:48:03,154 --> 00:48:05,140
Speaker 1: they don't even let cosplayers into the conventions.

790
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:06,540
Speaker 1: They force them to stay outside.

791
00:48:06,982 --> 00:48:09,778
Speaker 1: They don't let them in because it blocks the hallways and it's way too crowded.

792
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:10,763
Speaker 0: now Don't be a dick.

793
00:48:10,783 --> 00:48:14,040
Speaker 0: that's why you like walk over into the corner like photobomb everybody.

794
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,080
Speaker 1: No, no, but go go to any blog that has pictures of Japanese cosplayers.

795
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:22,453
Speaker 1: They will always be outside or in some sort of designated cosplaying area.

796
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:24,640
Speaker 0: They also put any costume I've ever seen in the u.s.

797
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:37,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, well they put a lot more work into it and they have more skills and that's one thing I can say is that anime Cons aside like if you go to a pecs or any non anime culture con They're like the average individual.

798
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:40,454
Speaker 0: cosplay is higher quality and there's far fewer of them as a result.

799
00:48:40,494 --> 00:48:42,900
Speaker 0: They garner way more attention.

800
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:46,473
Speaker 1: You know, I haven't really paid attention because cuz I'm so jaded.

801
00:48:46,514 --> 00:48:48,582
Speaker 0: I don't like oh, there's a big fruit fucker Whatever.

802
00:48:48,603 --> 00:48:48,985
Speaker 0: I mean like.

803
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:54,795
Speaker 1: I don't even like 40 people like oh my god Yeah, it's like at this point going to so many conventions cosplay just sort of like.

804
00:48:54,835 --> 00:48:55,920
Speaker 1: I don't even see it.

805
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,201
Speaker 1: Like.

806
00:48:56,221 --> 00:49:01,248
Speaker 1: you have to point it out to me like look at that Like I just is.

807
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:07,180
Speaker 1: it might as well be a person in regular clothes Like I don't even recognize it or it doesn't process in the brain whatsoever.

808
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:16,454
Speaker 1: It has to be something way clever or way it has to stand out from the crowd Right in some way that I'll actually notice like guys on stilts.

809
00:49:16,494 --> 00:49:18,140
Speaker 0: Don't even faze me at this point, right?

810
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,622
Speaker 1: It's got it.

811
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:24,049
Speaker 1: Not only does it have to stand out somehow so that it catches my eye But it also has to be recognizable.

812
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:25,354
Speaker 1: There's so many times lately.

813
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:34,500
Speaker 1: My problem is I go to a con someone's cosplaying is something and I see them and I say guy and my brain says cosplay guy and that's maybe at most right.

814
00:49:35,061 --> 00:49:39,494
Speaker 1: But that guy was actually cosplaying as something that I really like and I'm totally into.

815
00:49:39,574 --> 00:49:45,595
Speaker 1: and later someone would be like Scott Did you see the cosplay of such-and-such from whatever?

816
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:47,606
Speaker 1: and I'd be like no They'd be like.

817
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:53,940
Speaker 1: there it is and I'm like, oh I saw that I didn't realize that's what it was because it was a cosplay didn't even enter my brain, you know.

818
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,683
Speaker 0: Well, there's also.

819
00:49:54,723 --> 00:49:55,145
Speaker 0: I've had the.

820
00:49:55,607 --> 00:49:57,034
Speaker 0: it's funny that back in the day.

821
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:05,135
Speaker 0: I used to always like at conventions I dressed a lot dressed actually less nerdy geeky than I do now and I'd usually wear like a collared shirt maybe a tie like.

822
00:50:05,155 --> 00:50:08,900
Speaker 0: I was always kind of dressed up at Conventions and people would always stop me to take pictures.

823
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,934
Speaker 0: They thought I was cosplaying as like kaji or something or they didn't even know.

824
00:50:11,974 --> 00:50:13,159
Speaker 0: like one time a guy stopped me.

825
00:50:13,381 --> 00:50:14,271
Speaker 1: that does happen a lot.

826
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:21,253
Speaker 1: when I was at Kinetic on and we had those little headsets with the things right to walk around Somebody was like are you out?

827
00:50:21,273 --> 00:50:22,020
Speaker 1: Uh, and I'm like what?

828
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,920
Speaker 1: I was like, I thought that they were asking if I was staff and I was like, yeah I'm staff and they're like, can I take your picture?

829
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,800
Speaker 1: I'm like, all right, but they were actually asking if I was a scout from Team Fortress 2 because he has the headset thing.

830
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:34,907
Speaker 1: They thought that I was a scout.

831
00:50:34,927 --> 00:50:38,854
Speaker 0: what I used to say is every time someone asked me I'd be like I'm dressed up as a katani from initial day.

832
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:42,488
Speaker 1: Yeah Whereas jeans and a polo shirt.

833
00:50:42,889 --> 00:50:45,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a key just a t-shirt jeans and a t-shirt.

834
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:46,620
Speaker 1: I'm it's a key.

835
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,248
Speaker 0: third People would at one point.

836
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,020
Speaker 0: I remember this very vividly.

837
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:56,780
Speaker 0: I don't know what kind it was, but someone stopped me and they took my picture and I was like, what do you what?

838
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,970
Speaker 0: do you think I'm cosplaying as?

839
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:05,820
Speaker 0: and He looked at me and he really didn't have an answer and he's kind of wandered away And it was just such a weird experience.

840
00:51:06,342 --> 00:51:07,827
Speaker 1: Maybe he just you know had the hots for you.

841
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,738
Speaker 1: There's a lot of those cosplay photo.

842
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:13,156
Speaker 0: Oh my god There's all of them Otakon.

843
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:21,000
Speaker 0: every year There's that one fat guy who has a super awesome DSLR and he is just taking pictures of cleavage and being super creepy.

844
00:51:21,282 --> 00:51:22,794
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's plenty of guys like that.

845
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,850
Speaker 1: No shortage You know, I want to address that one issue right?

846
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:27,051
Speaker 1: is it?

847
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:28,416
Speaker 1: in the cosplay community?

848
00:51:28,436 --> 00:51:29,480
Speaker 1: There's loads of drama.

849
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,668
Speaker 0: How do you people have so much drama?

850
00:51:31,728 --> 00:51:32,491
Speaker 0: Jesus fucking

851
00:51:32,532 --> 00:51:47,136
Speaker 1: Christ, but a lot of the drama is you know the way we you know the way we as you know gamers hate on for example Farmville people or the way that you know comic fans will hate on people who read the kind of comics that they don't read.

852
00:51:47,498 --> 00:51:52,940
Speaker 1: whatever the you know, The regular superhero guys will hate the manga people and vice versa and indie people hate everybody.

853
00:51:53,145 --> 00:51:53,452
Speaker 1: right?

854
00:51:54,141 --> 00:52:04,520
Speaker 1: the cosplay people seem to have that same hate for the people who wear a Naruto headband and draw some whiskers on their face and Think that they're you know cosplay but they also hate each other like oh that costumes too good.

855
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,468
Speaker 0: It was clearly mass-manufactured and I did.

856
00:52:07,508 --> 00:52:09,013
Speaker 1: they hate anyone who buys a costume.

857
00:52:09,113 --> 00:52:18,640
Speaker 1: also, right and it's like, you know Okay, I don't really see somebody wearing the Naruto headband the same as a Farmville player.

858
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:25,404
Speaker 1: I see them more as a street fighter player who mashes the buttons Doesn't get any hits.

859
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,795
Speaker 1: right they're playing the same game, right?

860
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:30,320
Speaker 1: They're playing the highest skill game.

861
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,927
Speaker 1: They just have really low skill.

862
00:52:31,987 --> 00:52:34,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm not gonna hate him cuz they're trying.

863
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,310
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not gonna give him any recognition cuz I suck in.

864
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:38,696
Speaker 0: Scott don't know where they are.

865
00:52:38,977 --> 00:52:39,639

893
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,855
Speaker 1: I love clever cosplays and one subset of clever cosplay that I really like is the combo cosplay.

895
00:53:56,782 --> 00:53:57,975

901
00:54:14,443 --> 00:54:17,379
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and they kept bringing it to the club like it was their friend.

Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, they dressed up as a barrel.

903
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:21,840
Speaker 0: Well, what they do is they bring it in they'd wear shirts with it.

904

00:54:34,634 --> 00:54:35,960
Speaker 1: Maybe I forget who was actually in it.

907
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,823
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it was calm.

908
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:38,610
Speaker 1: It's one of those people in the trouble.

909
00:54:38,691 --> 00:54:41,927
Speaker 0: I saw a picture of that group Not that long ago.

910
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:43,720
Speaker 0: I was looking through old pictures I'd taken.

911
00:54:45,022 --> 00:54:47,054
Speaker 0: They look like like 12 year old little kids.

912
00:54:47,074 --> 00:54:51,168

915
00:54:57,942 --> 00:55:01,053
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah, is there anything else to say about cosplays?

916
00:55:01,073 --> 00:55:02,780
Speaker 1: I have no cosplay making skills.

917
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:06,440
Speaker 0: No, I'm famous for my lack of cosplaying making skills.

918
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:16,119
Speaker 1: I guess you know cosplay does have a lot of crossover right because it crosses over into the animes and the comics and the game steampunk and the sign and the sci-fi.

919
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, and people cosplay as like historical figures of SCA stuff Renaissance fairs.

924
00:55:35,261 --> 00:55:37,228
Speaker 1: Well cosplay doesn't touch every part of your life.

925
00:55:37,248 --> 00:55:40,420
Speaker 1: You don't need to learn it, but it does touch every geekery, right?

926
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:45,710
Speaker 0: Well, I think what it is is that any no matter what your hobby is even if it is possible to make a costume related To it.
