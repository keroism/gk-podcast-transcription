1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,488
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday November 14th.

2
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:12,691
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:15,279
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:18,199
Speaker 0: tonight We discuss the x-men.

5
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:25,397
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:35,187
Speaker 1: Well, I came home today, and I was greeted by a gigantic geek nights canvas banner the fur.

7
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:36,250
Speaker 1: well vinyl like canvas.

8
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:38,102
Speaker 1: I wanted canvas, but it costs a lot more money.

9
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:41,857
Speaker 0: Yeah canvas plus You know can be damaged much more easily than vinyl.

10
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:49,884
Speaker 0: I mean even if we spill like though the Thomas Jefferson's red wine Port on to our canvas you know vinyl banner.

11
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:52,790
Speaker 0: It'll just pour right off Drop it on the canvas banner.

12
00:00:53,152 --> 00:01:00,070
Speaker 0: We have to buy a new one and you know what one drop of that wine If it was real and not fake could pay for a hundred of those banners.

13
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:06,564
Speaker 1: So the most expensive ones were like the silk, but they I mean they look crazy good And they're like this matte finish, but silk screening.

14
00:01:06,865 --> 00:01:07,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't need that.

15
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:16,490
Speaker 1: But yeah for any of you go to the New York anime festival You're gonna see a lot of the early parts of swag and stuff because we've actually

16
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:22,230
Speaker 0: We're halfway to the swag like we have this list of swag and we're sort of working towards getting all of it.

17
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,370
Speaker 0: But the most important swags are also the hardest to you know build up.

18
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:35,229
Speaker 0: But we're basically gonna build up this mountain of swag and then like dole it out slowly over time and once that swag machine Is turning it won't stop?

19
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,256
Speaker 0: It's just a very big gear.

20
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:39,705
Speaker 0: so you know it takes a lot of energy before you get it rotating.

21
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:42,556
Speaker 0: and but once it's rotating It you know inertia, and yeah,

22
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:57,468
Speaker 1: and I can say this in the near future and why I'm saying near future I mean next week or two maybe maybe three We're not gonna have t-shirts for sale or anything But we're probably gonna have our first t-shirt design available for you to look at and tell us if you actually want to buy it.

23
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:00,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really like the direction.

24
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:01,850
Speaker 1: It's going so far.

25
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:05,830
Speaker 0: So it's gonna be hard for us to set up an actual like web store.

26
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:14,609
Speaker 0: Because if any if you've never actually tried to set up like an online store and not just a crap I have a press not just cafe press like an actual one.

27
00:02:15,212 --> 00:02:27,780
Speaker 0: Let me tell you every you know free program that does that sucks balls And it really sucks is because a lot of them are designed for people who are like really doing it like full-on And we're only kind of sort of doing it.

28
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,830
Speaker 0: You know we're not making like a full online store.

29
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,990
Speaker 0: I don't need tracking of massive inventory or tax stuff.

30
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,670
Speaker 0: I kind of need tech stuff, but I don't need the application to do it for me.

31
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,910
Speaker 0: And and these things that just have way more features than I ever need.

32
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:50,268
Speaker 1: But yeah, I think for now once we actually have this stuff We'll probably just sell them at cons at price just until we figure out how we're gonna deal with all that.

33
00:02:50,449 --> 00:03:01,849
Speaker 1: yep So the moral of that is if you want to see the early linger the early bits of swag that are coming out You might want to come to the New York anime festival, and we're also doing a bunch of cool events there, but whatever.

34
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,194
Speaker 1: well We're doing the match game.

35
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:04,901
Speaker 1: We're doing another match game.

36
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:10,183
Speaker 1: We're doing our famous or Infamous Gekiga panel, and it's modified.

37
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:15,540
Speaker 1: It's a somewhat less Rapedastic and more informative and actually about Gekiga.

38
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:23,225
Speaker 0: Yeah, and play it helps that I have now You know decided that I will use the word Gekiga more freely based on a book.

39
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:24,629
Speaker 1: I read oh really yes.

40
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:27,199
Speaker 1: Well, maybe we'll talk about that at the panel.

41
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,986
Speaker 1: Maybe it's gonna be a good time.

42
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:30,030
Speaker 1: We're gonna record it.

43
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,376
Speaker 1: I don't know if we'll put it on the air.

44
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:32,884
Speaker 0: who knows maybe not.

45
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:34,110
Speaker 1: you'll have to come and see it live.

46
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:35,534
Speaker 0: When is the New York anime fest?

47
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:40,510
Speaker 1: it is December 7th 8th and 9th at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York City?

48
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:41,802
Speaker 1: We'll be there the whole time.

49
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:42,469
Speaker 1: We'll have a table.

50
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:44,907
Speaker 1: You can't miss us.

51
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:51,768
Speaker 1: also, don't miss it we have Dave at least and possibly Joel from Dave and Joel's fast karate.

52
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:58,770
Speaker 1: for the gentleman They're going to be our well I don't want to say personal staff, but they're basically attached to us, and we'll be using them for various things.

53
00:03:59,131 --> 00:03:59,733
Speaker 0: Did they know this?

54
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:00,395
Speaker 1: oh?

55
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:00,576
Speaker 1: Yeah?

56
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,707
Speaker 0: I made it quite clear all right, and we'll see how that goes.

57
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:18,978
Speaker 1: and the well I'm paying for his badge indirectly indirectly Plus uh it turns out that at least one member of anime world order possibly two will be there though the second one is wishy-washy Very wishy-washy and the ninja consultants are gonna be there.

58
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:19,160
Speaker 1: well.

59
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,882
Speaker 0: They live right there.

60
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:20,202
Speaker 0: Well.

61
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:21,387
Speaker 1: They better be there.

62
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:27,530
Speaker 1: I mean God There's an anime con within an hour of your house, and you don't even least go for one day.

63
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,142
Speaker 1: You got a problem unless you hate anime.

64
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,089
Speaker 0: I guess yeah, yeah.

65
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,550
Speaker 1: But then again you can go to Otakon hating anime and not knowing what it is and still have a great time.

66
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:35,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got it.

67
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:35,415
Speaker 0: Well.

68
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:45,090
Speaker 0: I guess it's hard to go to PAX not like in games, but Yeah, I guess if you were a griefer yeah, do you want me to try tell the French toast story?

69
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:46,634
Speaker 1: I guess you could.

70
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:47,859
Speaker 0: it's kind of a sad story.

71
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,441
Speaker 1: It is sad.

72
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:50,189
Speaker 1: I feel bad for you like I really do this.

73
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,219
Speaker 0: Oh, so my work right in.

74
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:58,997
Speaker 0: only every Wednesday the office buys food for everybody and it's usually 90% of the time.

75
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:06,299
Speaker 0: 99% of the time it's the same like basket full of bagels and Cream cheese and like a stack of regular cheese or whatever.

76
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:15,269
Speaker 0: and they just put it on this counter and everyone goes over on their Own time and grabs a bagel on Wednesday morning right and then by Wednesday by Thursday They're all hard as rocks.

77
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:17,735
Speaker 0: They throw them out Because no one knows what is it.

78
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:30,623
Speaker 0: black bag is and I think I'm gonna start bringing ziploc bags to sort of bring bagels Over to Thursday and get people pissed off at me, but anyway curse him with his clever ingenuity So far in the time I've been working there, which is almost a year.

79
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:32,369
Speaker 0: Maybe like six to eight months something like that.

80
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:34,862
Speaker 0: Yeah, some some like eight months.

81
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:42,090
Speaker 0: They have twice Ordered food specially where they the one person who's job it is to deal with this.

82
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:44,318
Speaker 0: Well send everyone an email with a menu.

83
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:47,230
Speaker 0: you read the menu and you reply with what you want, right?

84
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:51,110
Speaker 0: So last week they she sent out an email and she's like order stuff.

85
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,358
Speaker 0: We're gonna get good food this week instead of bagels.

86
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:54,020
Speaker 0: and I was like woohoo.

87
00:05:54,564 --> 00:06:03,864
Speaker 0: So look to the menu and I said French toast Okay, and then I got an email the next day that was like yeah guys where we're not gonna do it cuz not enough people Replied in time.

88
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:06,136
Speaker 0: We're just get bagels this week and we'll do the food next week.

89
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:10,180
Speaker 0: Ah So it's next week now now is next week, right?

90
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:15,379
Speaker 0: so yesterday there was an email in the morning that said hey order stuff and I'm like, oh, yeah, right ordering stuff.

91
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:19,509
Speaker 0: and I said I'll do it in a few minutes and then I forgot completely.

92
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:28,270
Speaker 0: Oh man, and this morning I go into work I'm expecting bagels cuz I totally forgot And co-worker walks by is like hey Scott your order food.

93
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,658
Speaker 0: I'm like shit forgot to order food.

94
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:38,632
Speaker 0: Damn it Oh, well, and then I tried to eat one of my yogurts that I bought at the grocery But at the bodega and bodega bodega.

95
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:38,853
Speaker 0: Yeah.

96
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:40,660
Speaker 0: Meanwhile the bodegas and Soho are not cheap.

97
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,853
Speaker 0: The yogurt was a dollar whereas yogurt and ShopRite is 33 cents.

98
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:44,656
Speaker 1: What a yogurt.

99
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:47,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's bullshit But anyway, there were no spoons.

100
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:49,780
Speaker 0: So I have to bring a spoon to work tomorrow to eat my yogurt.

101
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,129
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna go.

102
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:54,880
Speaker 0: I didn't get my food.

103
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:58,011
Speaker 0: yeah, that sucks right but then make it worse right.

104
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:03,067
Speaker 0: I walk over there a little later to where the food was and This is French toast sitting there.

105
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:04,232
Speaker 0: It's a styrofoam thing.

106
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:05,237
Speaker 0: It says French toast on it.

107
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:05,800
Speaker 0: Just sitting there.

108
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:08,820
Speaker 1: I guess the French toast unlike the cake was not a lie.

109
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,402
Speaker 0: It was all.

110
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:17,169
Speaker 0: it was all alone sitting there all alone and I was just like, oh, it's cold now I'm not gonna eat it.

111
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,540
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna let it sit there.

112
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,034
Speaker 1: That's like the saddest story I've ever heard.

113
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:23,039
Speaker 0: it was pretty sad.

114
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:32,647
Speaker 0: They still ordered my French toast, even though I forgot to reorder it and then I didn't eat it cuz I had no one told me No one said anything.

115
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:38,790
Speaker 1: so that the French toast when they walked by and they're thinking that bastard We made sure he got his toast.

116
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,554
Speaker 1: He didn't even eat it.

117
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:40,499
Speaker 0: bad, man.

118
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:45,639
Speaker 0: Meanwhile later in the day Apparently some people noticed that there was a French toast sitting there and I think someone ate it.

119
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,227
Speaker 1: Well, duh if I'm walking through my office and I just see unattended French toast I walked by an hour later and it's still there.

120
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:53,150
Speaker 1: I'm eating it.

121
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:55,500
Speaker 0: It was actually even better.

122
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,074
Speaker 0: It was a closed a styrofoam container that said French toast.

123
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:04,540
Speaker 1: now actually today Someone walked by and said hey, there's uh, some food left over from something over there.

124
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:05,924
Speaker 1: No, it's I ignore it.

125
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:07,288
Speaker 1: and ten minutes later.

126
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:19,599
Speaker 1: I walk over there and the leftover food was super fancy sushi Uh-huh, so I ate enough to make myself feel a little sick and then I went back to work, uh-huh My story is not sad.

127
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:29,569
Speaker 0: No My story is sad is the sad tale of the French toast that went uneaten by me But I should I could have eaten it that morning If I just know and if someone would open their mouth.

128
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,395
Speaker 0: and so that's twice in eight months that my work has ordered special food on Wednesday instead of just the bagels that normally get.

129
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:39,900
Speaker 0: and Twice I've had a problem but the story of the other time is not interesting.

130
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:54,589
Speaker 1: So well speaking of sad news though This is probably only sad depending in a not in a oh my god I'm gonna cry sense but more in a wow good god sense So you might know this company called mythware.

131
00:08:54,669 --> 00:09:05,040
Speaker 1: now if you don't they make all those kind of tacky Black bags with like a square picture of an anime character on the front or a nerve logo or something.

132
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:12,896
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know when you go to anime convention the dealers room There's that one company that has like all these messenger bags all sorts different anime logos on them.

133
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:13,758
Speaker 1: That's mythware.

134
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:14,220
Speaker 0: That's them.

135
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,732
Speaker 1: They license pretty much every property they can and they make those.

136
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:19,800
Speaker 0: I mean, we've talked like those nerve bags.

137
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:21,468
Speaker 1: We've talked before about how in general.

138
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:24,625
Speaker 1: I mean, actually I think the nerve bags are pretty cool, but alright That's the best bag.

139
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,912
Speaker 0: They've got a lot of them.

140
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:32,180
Speaker 1: The flcl one's really good, too Okay, but a lot of them are just like most American fan stuff is really kind of tacky.

141
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:40,000
Speaker 1: It's always like the black t-shirt with either just the text on it or like the square picture of the red dragon breathing fire.

142
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:49,476
Speaker 1: Yep, and like Emily got me a Japanese ghost in the shell shirt And it's I. I feel weird using this word to describe this but I think it's app.

143
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:50,640
Speaker 1: It's a classy shirt.

144
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:51,835
Speaker 0: It's pretty class.

145
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:57,157
Speaker 1: I'd like Japanese people get it and Americans don't but I it doesn't matter because the stuff sells.

146
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:03,076
Speaker 1: but anyway mythware Didn't go out of business at least not officially or anything.

147
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:04,120
Speaker 1: They didn't blow anything up.

148
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,476
Speaker 0: They just they didn't file for bankruptcy at some court.

149
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:09,003
Speaker 1: They just Disappeared.

150
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,625
Speaker 1: they're gone.

151
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,753
Speaker 1: They just suddenly stopped answering their phone.

152
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,460
Speaker 1: They're their websites down.

153
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:14,683
Speaker 1: No one can get a hold of them.

154
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:15,265
Speaker 1: right.

155
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:17,852
Speaker 1: stuff was like, ah, alright fine.

156
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,459
Speaker 1: We hereby rescind all licenses to you.

157
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:23,746
Speaker 1: and Yeah, what the hell dudes?

158
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:33,739
Speaker 0: Well, you know people sometimes businesses just sort of disappear, you know That often doesn't happen that often but I've seen it happen quite a few times in my life.

159
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,160
Speaker 0: usually.

160
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:37,373
Speaker 0: Usually though it involves shady business.

161
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,040
Speaker 1: This wasn't a shady business.

162
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:44,040
Speaker 1: Now what I do want to say a lot of people I mean you could take this.

163
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,751
Speaker 1: Anyway, I saw one comment on the internet that was basically.

164
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:47,736
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

165
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:53,115
Speaker 1: Oh my god I really wanted a nerve bag, but I can never afford one and now I'll never get one.

166
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:54,520
Speaker 1: This is the worst thing ever.

167
00:10:55,178 --> 00:10:58,385
Speaker 1: Ah But I could care less.

168
00:10:58,446 --> 00:11:03,260
Speaker 1: I mean, oh no, I can't buy semi-tacky black bags with anime characters on him anymore.

169
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:07,968
Speaker 1: Oh, I think this is a symptom of the general.

170
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:12,934
Speaker 1: I don't know Non-professional miss of the American anime industry as a whole.

171
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:13,937
Speaker 1: I mean one.

172
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:14,600
Speaker 0: I do agree.

173
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,162
Speaker 0: There is too much.

174
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:26,110
Speaker 1: the fact that right stuff was licensing all their stuff through this company that just disappeared and obviously was not the most together act to begin with and The fact that this sort of thing can happen.

175
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:27,891
Speaker 1: I feel like I Don't know.

176
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:32,593
Speaker 1: the industry is just not run the way it should be and it's run by a lot of people who probably don't have A lot of business.

177
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:36,850
Speaker 0: This is what happens when you get fans running things as opposed to business professionals.

178
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:42,183
Speaker 0: I mean not, you know, a lot of people would say oh business professionals would fuck over the fans They do all these are.

179
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:42,910
Speaker 0: well You know.

180
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,533
Speaker 0: It's sort of like.

181
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:52,968
Speaker 0: you need someone who is it was a fan and respects the actual thing That they're the business that they're doing and knows about the business but also has business sense and is a professional.

182
00:11:53,008 --> 00:12:01,110
Speaker 0: for example look at say I'm just gonna pick any random car company right to the people at the head of that car company.

183
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,030
Speaker 0: Are they really like car nuts who really like they watch top gear and they really love cars?

184
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:16,770
Speaker 0: Maybe some of them but most of them are just CEOs who care about stock markets and business and all that stuff and as a result Car companies not so appealing to the the people who really like cars.

185
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,950
Speaker 0: But on the other hand if you had say Joe for the local mechanics like being the president of Ford, right?

186
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:28,710
Speaker 0: He loves hot rods Ford isn't gonna make too much money and it's gonna be sort of shoddy.

187
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:31,303
Speaker 0: So you got to find someone who's got both.

188
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:39,110
Speaker 0: like the guys who run Google They know about internet and technology and whatnot and they respect it, but they also have business sense and they're mad monies.

189
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:51,389
Speaker 1: So if you wanted any of this mythware stuff buy it from wherever you can get it because Even if they reappear come back online or anything to quote right stuff.

190
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:55,366
Speaker 1: Additionally all license agreements between mythware and right stuff.

191
00:12:55,426 --> 00:13:00,350
Speaker 1: concerning right stuff Those omi entertainment properties are considered canceled effective immediately.

192
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:10,241
Speaker 0: Uh, do they have like they guess that'll a there might be if I guess if this company comes back if that revoking of license Is not allowed under the contract.

193
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:10,924
Speaker 0: There might be some.

194
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:12,230
Speaker 1: I have a feeling.

195
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:24,868
Speaker 1: I have a feeling though that the company that disappears is not gonna win a lawsuit though In breach of contract Stuff is fulfilling as many of the orders for this stuff that they already had as they can until they run out.

196
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:33,150
Speaker 0: All right so Marvel Comics, right if you want to read him you cannot is three ways to read them, right?

197
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:37,682
Speaker 0: Three ways to read Marvel Comics legally ready way number one.

198
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,728
Speaker 0: Well, actually four ways therefore.

199
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:44,180
Speaker 0: four To read Marvel Comics legally as of last week.

200
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:52,410
Speaker 0: way number one you could buy paper Monthly comic books in the comic book store, which is crap - you can buy trade paperbacks.

201
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:54,187
Speaker 0: That is the preferred method by Scott.

202
00:13:54,872 --> 00:14:04,678
Speaker 0: Three you could doubt I guess non-legal way You can fire at them from the Internet's get a bit torrent full of every Marvel comic every week Yeah, and the fourth legal the fourth.

203
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:08,730
Speaker 0: the fourth way which is also a legal way is to buy those DVDs that are like.

204
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:15,349
Speaker 0: You know, uh, you know every like 400 issues of spider-man on DVDs and PDF format buy me in a box.

205
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:23,590
Speaker 0: Now Marvel Comics has added one more legal way to read Marvel Comics on their website.

206
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:32,905
Speaker 0: Basically, they made this sort of comic reading application of sorts That lets you like read panel by panel or zoom in and all this stuff.

207
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:34,570
Speaker 0: And is it a good application?

208
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:35,359
Speaker 0: I don't know.

209
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:44,470
Speaker 0: I haven't tried it But it's it's sort of like it's not you know, like it's pretty DRM dump, you know You can't like get the comics and stuff and you have to pay money.

210
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,817
Speaker 0: They're giving out like freeze through.

211
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:48,210
Speaker 0: certain comics are available as like free samples.

212
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,158
Speaker 0: You can check it out and I'm probably check it out later.

213
00:14:50,519 --> 00:15:02,998
Speaker 0: See if it works on Linux lol, but If you go to the website They have like you can now what read the comics digitally and they're gonna let you pay more money to get access to a whole Shit ton of comics digitally like.

214
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,929
Speaker 0: if you actually pay the money, it's really I don't know How much money it is because I didn't look into this too much.

215
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:21,589
Speaker 0: But you can read for example the first hundred issues of Amazing Spider-Man the first hundred issues of Fantastic Four The initial 66 issues of Uncanny X-Men the first 50 issues the Avengers more and more etc, etc.

216
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,331
Speaker 0: etc.

217
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:29,115
Speaker 0: and new stuff too, you know, so you agreed runaways on there apparently and even though I own that All kinds of stuff.

218
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:43,009
Speaker 0: So if you want to read if you've never read these comics and you like Superhero underwear perfect comics and you want to read a whole bunch of them on the cheap This really isn't too bad If you don't mind doing it in front of the computer with this Marvel comics.

219
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,698
Speaker 1: That's the thing I'd really have to be able to put it on.

220
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:48,370
Speaker 1: if I owned one an e-reader or something or wouldn't be worth it?

221
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:49,034
Speaker 0: I'm sure.

222
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,550
Speaker 0: I guess if you might be able to if it I think it's web-based.

223
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,569
Speaker 0: So maybe you could do it on an iPhone or something I don't know or not like a tablet PC.

224
00:15:56,052 --> 00:16:05,681
Speaker 1: But most people would have like, you know an e-reader if they're gonna be reading any sort of e-thing Yep, and if it doesn't work on an e-reader I Wall, it's a step in the right direction at the same time.

225
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,596
Speaker 1: It's not a step in the right right direction Exactly.

226
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:13,630
Speaker 0: It's sort of like someone on our Forum today posted some like Wi-Fi radio playing device.

227
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,170
Speaker 0: It is a step in the right direction, but it wasn't over the line to where it actually becomes a useful realistic thing.

228
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,363
Speaker 0: It was sort of like yeah half-assed almost halfway there kind of deal.

229
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:25,770
Speaker 0: So this is sort of a halfway kind of deal.

230
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:31,030
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, we recognize that comics on paper is the old way and comics digitally is the new way.

231
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:35,070
Speaker 0: Here's a sort of crappy digital comic thing, but that's sort of okay.

232
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,837
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna check it out later.

233
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:44,850
Speaker 0: the free sample part see how it is that there is definitely one thing I think it's definitely in color which is an advantage compared.

234
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:49,026
Speaker 0: I buy the big black books like the big, you know essential whatever right which is.

235
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:49,990
Speaker 0: I recommend them.

236
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,488
Speaker 0: Actually, you can get like a shit ton of comics that are old for like 15 bucks.

237
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:58,690
Speaker 0: You can get like 30 issues of like the Fantastic Four.

238
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:04,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you like that stuff and you have like a train commute or something Well, there you go and like one big black and white newsprint book.

239
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,109
Speaker 0: You know those big black ones you see on the shelf in the the bookstore, right?

240
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,595
Speaker 0: But they're not in color.

241
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:12,548
Speaker 0: So if this is in color, it might actually be a better deal.

242
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:12,890
Speaker 0: I got it.

243
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,531
Speaker 0: I look into it.

244
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:23,300
Speaker 1: Well, we've been debating if I should still say things of the day.

245
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,614
Speaker 1: So I guess I kind of said it but do you want me to keep saying it?

246
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:27,257
Speaker 1: Do you care?

247
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:28,079
Speaker 1: I'm curious.

248
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:30,226
Speaker 1: Anyway, I mean people must care.

249
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:37,372
Speaker 1: someone asked on questions week why I always say it and the answer was I just do though Scott just now refused to say it.

250
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:38,117
Speaker 1: So, I don't know.

251
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:43,615
Speaker 1: Anyway things of the day things of the day things of the day.

252
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:47,596
Speaker 0: Shut up in 2007 I'm just not gonna do the show.

253
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:49,582
Speaker 1: Alright, go on.

254
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:50,204
Speaker 0: It shows over.

255
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:56,643
Speaker 0: All right in 2007 this professor in France named Brigitte Koyoma.

256
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:58,531
Speaker 0: Richard do I I guess?

257
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:04,254
Speaker 0: if she must be part Japanese part French I guess good judging by her last name or maybe she just married a Japanese guy.

258
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:04,616
Speaker 0: I don't know.

259
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:10,836
Speaker 0: she Wrote, oh, she's a University of Tokyo professor, but she was in she was French.

260
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:11,579
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

261
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:13,579
Speaker 0: Okay I don't really understand that but that's not the point.

262
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:28,322
Speaker 0: Anyway, she wrote this book 1,000 years of manga and The book covers the history of the manga all the way from wall paintings and Japanese temples all the way up to Naruto's.

263
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:32,477
Speaker 1: and such is this book in English or at least for all.

264
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:47,658
Speaker 0: say it's a 240 it's a 240 page hardcover book and in February of 2008 is the French publisher fla marion viva la wah will Release an English translation of this book and I will buy it.

265
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:49,910
Speaker 1: good I because if you didn't I was going to up.

266
00:18:50,533 --> 00:19:00,146
Speaker 1: we were talking about be $49.95 because for some reason lately we've been talking about coffee table books a lot and then you know I made the analogy of coffee table games.

267
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:03,900
Speaker 1: and if ever there were a coffee table book that would go well in this house.

268
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,045
Speaker 0: It is that I don't know.

269
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:06,872
Speaker 0: There's that other one that's written by that Jason.

270
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:08,780
Speaker 0: What's his which I also want that cover.

271
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:17,040
Speaker 0: It's basically a book that contains a synopsis and like a you know The information on every manga published in the US since he wrote it.

272
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:24,013
Speaker 1: I imagine once we build the geekhouse mark - you know our manor house somewhere with our millions Well in the reading room, we'll have a selection.

273
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:36,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have noticed though There's this increased trend of people writing like academic books or at least publishing in English academic books about Manga and anime and Japanese culture stuff.

274
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:45,430
Speaker 1: It's not like they could ignore it because it's it kind of swept America pretty quickly Kinda, but it's like, you know, there's some other you don't see.

275
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:55,040
Speaker 0: I guess you see some academic books about video games and stuff And you know, but it it just seems like there's a really a bigger market for the academic books about the animes and the mangas.

276
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,254
Speaker 0: Then there is for the other nerdy things.

277
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:58,100
Speaker 1: I don't know.

278
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:01,040
Speaker 1: I mean I have seen several academic works on video game.

279
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:05,280
Speaker 1: Most of them are studies trying to figure out if they cause violence or not.

280
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm saying there seems to be a lot of them, you know and meant for the people who enjoy them You know and I think that's good because I like those things.

281
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:13,799
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty cool to learn.

282
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:18,635
Speaker 0: You know sort of like the the the in-depth information about what you're reading.

283
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:23,991
Speaker 0: instead of just getting you know The thing you did the surface you got to go deep guy with your shovels.

284
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:25,797
Speaker 1: So what?

285
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,980
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, man I said go deep.

286
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,595
Speaker 1: I realize now that I could have used that as a really good segue into my thing of the day.

287
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:32,920
Speaker 0: tough shit go deeper.

288
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:35,133
Speaker 1: The path before you has been prepared.

289
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:41,173
Speaker 1: All right anyway This is kind of a cop-out but my rationale super cop-out.

290
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:47,120
Speaker 1: my rationale is thus I'm done with using anything that's on the front page of dig.

291
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:52,294
Speaker 1: I'm not just gonna be Instead of things of the day for a long time and we've been breaking from it when we can.

292
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:56,389
Speaker 1: it always seems to turn into Dig video of the day.

293
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:59,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does turn into dig video of the day And I I don't know.

294
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:01,398
Speaker 1: do you guys watch every dig video?

295
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:03,231
Speaker 1: That's good Like we do or do you not?

296
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:04,380
Speaker 1: do you want us to keep doing that?

297
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,687
Speaker 1: Do you want us to be your filter or can you feel to yourselves?

298
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,216
Speaker 0: Yeah,

299
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:25,920
Speaker 1: but that aside I Realized that I'd never directly linked to this and if I did I couldn't find it and I way back We did a show with the esteemed Jeff to Tarik about anime music videos And I think I mentioned this is in my opinion one of the best overall anime music videos ever made.

300
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:31,154
Speaker 1: So thus I'm linking you to the YouTube version of night owl productions.

301
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:33,360
Speaker 1: Hit me baby one more time.

302
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:35,659
Speaker 0: It's rooms favorite anime music video.

303
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,996
Speaker 1: Now the thing is the reason I like it so much is that one.

304
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:42,226
Speaker 1: I think it's Expertly timed and expertly done.

305
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:50,730
Speaker 1: The only real thing you can say bad about it is that was done obviously with old VHS copies of utenna and there's artifacting galore.

306
00:21:50,770 --> 00:22:02,623
Speaker 1: but in terms of the timing and the technicalness of it that aside I think it's almost perfect and there's one little bit of humor that I think the guy or whoever did it just Discovered.

307
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:05,800
Speaker 1: he could put Rose all over the screen and decided to make a joke about a penis.

308
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,423
Speaker 0: It's actually.

309
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:21,095
Speaker 0: I think what's so great about this video is that it's sort of complex and that on the surface It is humorous like lol Yeah, but in reality if you've seen utenna and you watch this video a few times Suddenly it's not humorous as much anymore.

310
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,100
Speaker 0: It's sort of like whoa.

311
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,894
Speaker 1: Yeah In general, I'm a huge fan and I know Scott is to have anything that has like.

312
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,600
Speaker 1: the more level something has the better.

313
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,811
Speaker 1: Like an onion is the best thing in the world to us.

314
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:34,620
Speaker 0: I guess I guess gotta be a bigger onion.

315
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:47,288
Speaker 1: Well, there was the onion prince But just the I like it when something can work on a superficial level level in that, you know I've never seen the thing.

316
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:48,093
Speaker 1: This is referencing.

317
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:49,100
Speaker 1: I have no idea what it is.

318
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:59,448
Speaker 1: I'm seeing this in and of itself and it is enjoyable and hilarious and anime clubs that screen It will have people yelling and screaming because it is really funny And really stupid and weird.

319
00:22:59,509 --> 00:22:59,770
Speaker 1: it just.

320
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:01,960
Speaker 1: but like Scott said have you seen the show?

321
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:17,176
Speaker 1: it's Really well done and kind of Disturbing and it just brings back all these memories of the show and you just kind of at the end You'll tell you know The people who have seen utenna all the way through and the people who haven't People who haven't are laughing going what the fuck is up with those cars.

322
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:21,780
Speaker 1: That was great And at the end they laugh because it's kind of a funny scene it ends on.

323
00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:24,573
Speaker 1: But if you've seen the show those people are just kind of sitting there going.

324
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:27,626
Speaker 1: Oh, man That show was great.

325
00:23:28,027 --> 00:23:30,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is it watch it.

326
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:30,657
Speaker 1: Enjoy it.

327
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:40,788
Speaker 1: if you don't like it Well, uh, yeah die in a fire and such All right, I guess you can introduce this topic since you uh Partook of this more than I have.

328
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:43,060
Speaker 0: well, I guess I guess I know more about it.

329
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,548
Speaker 0: But we're today.

330
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:53,099
Speaker 1: we're gonna talk about the x-men Aka the uncanny x-men x-factor gonna talk about expect how about x-force?

331
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,626
Speaker 1: Nope How about the ridges the x-men?

332
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:56,207
Speaker 0: Yes.

333
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:56,949
Speaker 1: Yeah.

334
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,613
Speaker 1: Is there any other x-men we should talk about?

335
00:23:58,954 --> 00:23:59,596
Speaker 0: There's plenty.

336
00:23:59,676 --> 00:24:02,913
Speaker 0: Excalibur expo See that's that's happens.

337
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:03,357
Speaker 0: You're from the 90s.

338
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:11,658
Speaker 0: We're both you know, mostly I mean we were born in 82, but you know Our real culture came from the late 80s early 90s, you know towards the middle of the 90s.

339
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,880
Speaker 0: So that was you know, all those different exes were definitely Artifacts of the early 90s and that such that is the x-men we know best.

340
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:29,319
Speaker 1: I mean I can tell my story of x-men because it's much shorter than Scott's but I can't say that we're definitely Let me start telling like the history I guess in a very short way.

341
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:37,262
Speaker 0: Okay, so yeah, it's Stanley back in the day wrote comics about things in bold You're right.

342
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:40,693
Speaker 0: So he wrote on he wrote X. It was just x-men.

343
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,118
Speaker 0: It wasn't uncanny x-men.

344
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:42,620
Speaker 0: yet, right?

345
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:54,517
Speaker 0: It was just x-men and I think he wrote 66 issues if I'm not mistaken or something along those lines right, and then they reprinted him for a while and then so they kept making more numbers of x-men.

346
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:56,589
Speaker 0: like the number kept going up but they were all reprints.

347
00:24:57,358 --> 00:25:03,557
Speaker 0: and eventually then John Byrne and I forget his name They took over.

348
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:13,054
Speaker 0: They took over x-men Claremont Claremont and burn and that that's the x-men that everyone knows and loves is like You know the dark Phoenix and the the days of future past.

349
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:14,880
Speaker 0: and then all that God loves man kills.

350
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,720
Speaker 0: That was all Claremont and burn.

351
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:24,834
Speaker 0: So when you hear someone talking about burn x-men or Claremont burn x-men they're talking about the real x-men at least what most people consider to be the real deal.

352
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:25,315
Speaker 0: x-men.

353
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:25,977
Speaker 0: and that went on.

354
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:30,013
Speaker 0: and then like they changed the name to uncanny x-men and what you know, and stuff like that.

355
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:31,279
Speaker 0: and then they kept going.

356
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:40,134
Speaker 0: and Then I guess in the early 90s when we were kids they came out with Adjective lists x-men and all those other x-books and then it went crazy and I don't understand.

357
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:41,880
Speaker 0: don't ask me what's doing with x-men today.

358
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:45,939
Speaker 1: X men I read was when phalanx appeared.

359
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,161
Speaker 0: I Didn't.

360
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:48,647
Speaker 0: that was after I stopped reading.

361
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:51,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, but remember I didn't start until all right.

362
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:54,360
Speaker 0: So I started with adjective list x-men number one.

363
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:03,520
Speaker 0: However, the first time I ever encountered the x-men right was like someone else had like a coloring book of x-men and I got it From them and I didn't know what the fuck the x-men were.

364
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,477
Speaker 0: I was like what the hell's this coloring book and I never drew in it.

365
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:17,193
Speaker 0: And then sort of around the same time like I started reading x-men comics starting with adjective lists x-men number one and then Also watching x-men cartoon on Fox.

366
00:26:17,455 --> 00:26:18,239
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll get to that.

367
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:20,736
Speaker 0: I saw the first x-men live-action movie.

368
00:26:20,756 --> 00:26:22,128
Speaker 0: that was recent But I did not like it.

369
00:26:22,532 --> 00:26:28,960
Speaker 1: my uh My first experience is my parents especially my mom and her brother my uncle were actually really into comics as kids.

370
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,078
Speaker 1: And actually my uncle has I think almost all of the Fantastic Four Like from one on cuz he just read it.

371
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:40,429
Speaker 1: but hmm and there's all they have all these old comics everywhere And they also have a bunch of mad magazines, but that's beside the point.

372
00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:44,702
Speaker 1: So they didn't really understand why I was just not into comics.

373
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:47,210
Speaker 1: I didn't know about him didn't care about him at zero interest.

374
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:50,946
Speaker 0: I like I knew about comic books that I was just completely disinterested.

375
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:51,830
Speaker 0: what I knew together?

376
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:57,470
Speaker 1: I knew that there were this thing that all the kids in school were really into and I just thought it was stupid.

377
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:03,055
Speaker 0: See, here's the thing is I I knew about comic books like I would see like, you know Stereotypical like every day.

378
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:06,070
Speaker 0: I watched Dennis the Menace cartoon on TV and he'd have like a comic book, right?

379
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,166
Speaker 0: And I knew kids read comics just like I knew kids skateboarded.

380
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:14,421
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is All right, but no one I knew skateboarded or read comics.

381
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:17,669
Speaker 0: and eventually a kid who lived down the street for me He was reading comics.

382
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:24,069
Speaker 0: So I read some of them and that's when I started reading them because someone else is like, ah Yeah, I got to read him without having to pay for him.

383
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:30,130
Speaker 1: Opened in the mall and then the business exploded my mom went out and tried to get me into comics.

384
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,342
Speaker 1: So she bought me this x-men board game.

385
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:33,468
Speaker 1: I think you all remember it.

386
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:36,108
Speaker 1: there's the one that came with all those great plastic figures.

387
00:27:36,128 --> 00:27:43,810
Speaker 1: and Alright, I got this x-men game and it came with an x-men comic and I'm looking through it and the comic was alright.

388
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:49,799
Speaker 1: There's this blue guy and this guy with a with oh my god He's got laser beams coming out of his eyes, huh?

389
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,890
Speaker 0: The best guy that no one else likes with me.

390
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:53,302
Speaker 1: I'm indifferent to him.

391
00:27:53,322 --> 00:28:02,133
Speaker 1: Alright and Between that and the x-men TV series that box cartoon the best x-men ever my only x-men That is.

392
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:04,310
Speaker 0: that is video that is worth watching.

393
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:08,730
Speaker 1: I got into it and then I went and got back issues of the executioner song.

394
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:13,782
Speaker 1: I don't know why like someone told me to get into that and I read that and It was okay.

395
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:14,249
Speaker 1: I liked it.

396
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,930
Speaker 1: I don't remember much about what happened except at the end professor X could walk but then he couldn't again for some reason.

397
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:26,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, I believe that if I remember correctly That's where there was like some horrible virus that killed mutants and there was yeah, it looked like cable.

398
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,690
Speaker 0: that wasn't cable.

399
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I time travel cable.

400
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,324
Speaker 0: I know cable was.

401
00:28:31,364 --> 00:28:34,795
Speaker 0: my man was a Cable.

402
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:36,310
Speaker 1: why cable was awesome.

403
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:39,942
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz that was like, you know that 90s stuff that people want to forget about.

404
00:28:40,102 --> 00:28:46,123
Speaker 1: remember our era of x-men is like Cyclops and storm and Wolverine and cable and Bishop and all well just like.

405
00:28:46,284 --> 00:28:50,590
Speaker 0: just to the little comics history here Right in the early 90s is when comics exploded.

406
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,947
Speaker 0: That's when their comic book stores everywhere and you know the death of Superman and all this business going on with.

407
00:28:55,188 --> 00:29:05,650
Speaker 0: you know foil Covers and image comics and all this stuff that comics exploded and people were trying to make money off of them and the comic book guy sort of stuff like was all over the place and you know.

408
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:11,559
Speaker 0: And what happened was is people are making a lot of what most people think it's you know I mean most of the comics that are making.

409
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:19,719
Speaker 0: those days were pretty bad and it was pretty much just a rush on money and collecting and Speculating and printing way too many comics.

410
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,170
Speaker 0: and you know people paying way too much money for a comic with a foil cover.

411
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:26,139
Speaker 1: I remember when a Cyclops and Jean Grey got married.

412
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,805
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have that in my room.

413
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:28,427
Speaker 1: I I do.

414
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:29,470
Speaker 1: I also own it.

415
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:31,948
Speaker 1: I have two copies of it because don't ask me why.

416
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:43,319
Speaker 0: yeah that's what I'm talking about that kind of stuff and people nowadays look on that time as like a dark age in a way and that happened to be the age of us reading comics because of the year in which we happen to be born

417
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:52,114
Speaker 1: except I did other than the executioner's song and Sporadic because the thing is at that point I was like, all right, I can dig this I'm gonna try to get into this.

418
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:56,530
Speaker 1: and then every like x-men I got didn't follow from the last one.

419
00:29:56,971 --> 00:30:01,690
Speaker 1: And then I someone was like, oh you got to read this and this and this and this and I said what what the fuck?

420
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:02,714
Speaker 1: God, never mind.

421
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:03,277
Speaker 1: Just forget it.

422
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:03,839
Speaker 0: Yep.

423
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:10,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, so let me do a little Synopsis of what x-men is about in case someone doesn't know what x-men is about.

424
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:14,182
Speaker 0: So you have this world of people a lot like the real world.

425
00:30:14,483 --> 00:30:24,570
Speaker 0: and but in this world some people are Mutants and it does, you know, sometimes it means they're horrible monsters like the beast or something But most of the time they look like every other person.

426
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:32,130
Speaker 1: I submit that the blue-haired beast is a lot less horrible and ugly looking than the human looking beasts the original human looking.

427
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,355
Speaker 0: It was just kind of weird.

428
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,961
Speaker 0: Well, have you seen the cat beast?

429
00:30:35,604 --> 00:30:37,994
Speaker 0: No, I'll show it to you later Uh-huh.

430
00:30:38,094 --> 00:30:42,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people have changed the design of the beast over the years in different comics.

431
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:50,899
Speaker 0: But anyway, they you know and some people they're just they're born randomly just genetic mutation They're they're mutants, which means there's something weird about them.

432
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:57,250
Speaker 0: And sometimes usually they get a superpower, you know Sometimes the superpowers kind of useless but sometimes it's more useful.

433
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:10,700
Speaker 0: like you could be like Wolverine who can heal crazily making him almost invincible and Also have claws and also be a badass and also Unrelated to all that has an adamantium skeleton.

434
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,001
Speaker 0: Yes.

435
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:19,681
Speaker 0: He was that wasn't because of a mutation as far as I know Yeah, which I keep changing that story ripped out of him by magneto But yet he could still use his bone claws.

436
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,290
Speaker 0: and yeah, that was a big reveal.

437
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:28,336
Speaker 0: and then you have other people like Cyclops who has eye lasers or Colossus who can just make armor or Professor X.

438
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:33,861
Speaker 1: he was a telepath something that Colossus was gay I don't know like there was a news article or something.

439
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:34,685
Speaker 0: It wasn't even love.

440
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:35,207
Speaker 0: I don't know.

441
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,943
Speaker 0: I don't know either I don't read them anymore.

442
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:37,470
Speaker 0: So what do I know?

443
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:47,265
Speaker 1: I only like Colossus because in the game and the power was basically not the X-Men arcade game Colossus best character Yeah, his power was knock everyone down and he was bigger than everyone else.

444
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:48,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's all that matter.

445
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,884
Speaker 0: Cyclops is the second best because you could stay far away from the bad guys and still hit them.

446
00:31:51,984 --> 00:31:56,062
Speaker 1: and also nothing moves the blob Cyclops Who moves him easily?

447
00:31:56,102 --> 00:31:56,586
Speaker 1: easily.

448
00:31:56,888 --> 00:32:01,006
Speaker 0: so Yeah, so that in the X-Men you had this world where there's mutants.

449
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:08,617
Speaker 0: Some people are mutants some people aren't and the mutants are treated poorly much like African Americans are treated poorly in the US.

450
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:15,450
Speaker 0: and it was such a blatant obvious metaphor and that that was what they were trying to Write was like look is discrimination.

451
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:18,690
Speaker 0: Let's make a comic about discrimination using the mutants to symbolize.

452
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:44,550
Speaker 1: You know all the minorities of all that have ever been discriminated against and in a stroke of kind of genius You know the X-Men are gonna form and there's all these characters but the leader of the X-Men Professor X. they decided to make him a handicapped and there was a people had a big deal about that when the comic was when we you know, we saw this and because People didn't expect in some kind of superhero comic that there'd be a man in a wheelchair who is kind of the main superhero.

453
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's wicked powerful in his brain, but his legs don't work.

454
00:32:48,162 --> 00:32:50,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time he's probably the most powerful.

455
00:32:51,132 --> 00:33:06,446
Speaker 0: Maybe some magneto and Jean Grey, but that says Yeah, so the story is is that basically the mutants were discriminated against but Professor X was a powerful mutant Who was also very popular and was you know in with the government.

456
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:07,390
Speaker 0: He was a famous professor.

457
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:13,210
Speaker 0: So he says I'm gonna make a school in Salem, New York, which is sort of a real place that I kind of need.

458
00:33:13,315 --> 00:33:19,947
Speaker 0: Yeah And he gonna build a mansion there and it's gonna be a school for gifted youngsters.

459
00:33:20,028 --> 00:33:32,236
Speaker 0: and basically all these young kids who are mutants and their parents don't want to deal with them will bring them to the school and dump them there and he will raise them and teach them to control their powers and Raise them to be good people and

460
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,590
Speaker 1: then give them spandex make them superhero underwear perverts and send them around fighting evil.

461
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:37,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, sort of.

462
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:39,302
Speaker 0: but that wasn't part of the original plan.

463
00:33:39,322 --> 00:33:44,736
Speaker 0: I don't think but it happened anyway, because Because magneto Professor X's colleague.

464
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:50,630
Speaker 0: He had a different idea because Professor X is always saying mutants and humans could live in peace together.

465
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,797
Speaker 0: We don't have to keep fighting.

466
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:57,461
Speaker 1: and magneto partly because he was You know concentration camp action messed him up.

467
00:33:57,682 --> 00:33:59,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, because he is a mad Jew action.

468
00:34:00,152 --> 00:34:05,250
Speaker 1: He well, he was a mad Jew who had you had him right the magneto the mutant Jew.

469
00:34:06,451 --> 00:34:07,875
Speaker 0: He was in the concentration camp.

470
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:10,022
Speaker 1: Whatever his power had nothing to do with Judaism.

471
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:11,346
Speaker 1: His power was to control metal.

472
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:22,378
Speaker 0: hence magneto he's basically like he is the a Sentient magnet that is in basically as infinite magnet power or all new Incredibly ludicrously high magnet power.

473
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:25,770
Speaker 0: and he decided like he could slow down the spin of the earth like in one comic.

474
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,268
Speaker 0: He just shut electricity off on the entire earth.

475
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,654
Speaker 1: he pretty much decided that.

476
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:34,126
Speaker 1: one humans will eventually fight to destroy mutants because they fear them to.

477
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:39,085
Speaker 1: mutants are superior and Should use that power to control the world and make it better.

478
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:44,050
Speaker 1: and three The easiest way to make the world better in the end is to get rid of all the humans all humans.

479
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,137
Speaker 1: You want to kill all the humans?

480
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:49,527
Speaker 0: Hey hot mama wanna kill all humans.

481
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,777
Speaker 1: Hey hot Scott You want to say the exact same thing?

482
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:59,238
Speaker 0: I just said but uh steal my joke Which I stole from Futurama, of course Okay, of course.

483
00:34:59,278 --> 00:35:01,789
Speaker 0: That's if anyone doesn't know that's the story of the x-men.

484
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:04,797
Speaker 0: Any more details of fighting?

485
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:07,165
Speaker 1: rogue has some emotional issues.

486
00:35:07,225 --> 00:35:08,710
Speaker 1: Cyclops is all cocky.

487
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,170
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of characters.

488
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:11,494
Speaker 1: Is our saber-tooth?

489
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:12,798
Speaker 1: is the fucking man?

490
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:17,738
Speaker 0: the whole thing sort of just plays out like most Marvel comics of the day like a soap Opera, you know, it's.

491
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,149
Speaker 0: there's some status quo.

492
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:21,558
Speaker 0: You know if these people are good and these people are bad.

493
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,749
Speaker 0: and you know time after time crazy stuff happens.

494
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:28,056
Speaker 0: So, you know.

495
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:35,532
Speaker 0: so no someone's a villain someone else is doing something crazy over there something over here crazy stuffs happening Randomly.

496
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:40,410
Speaker 1: we're all getting into our sr-71 blackbird and going into space but oh shit something happens.

497
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:42,094
Speaker 0: Yeah and crazy stuff happens.

498
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:45,165
Speaker 0: and then return to the status quo and then crazy stuff happens.

499
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:45,888
Speaker 0: return to the sesco.

500
00:35:45,908 --> 00:35:48,390
Speaker 0: great and that's That's all the x-men is really.

501
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:50,809
Speaker 0: So what else you want to say about the x-men?

502
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:51,592
Speaker 1: I don't know.

503
00:35:51,632 --> 00:36:03,010
Speaker 1: the only x-men I actually liked was the Fox cartoon Because it was just the right thing for me at that age and I think it was in General less melodramatic and better written than most x-men comics.

504
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:04,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely.

505
00:36:04,615 --> 00:36:09,010
Speaker 0: but I think that the x-men cartoon if watched today, I'm not so sure it would hold up.

506
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,428
Speaker 1: I mean, there are a few other so not bitch that I think would in particular.

507
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:13,930
Speaker 1: I mean none of that.

508
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:40,650
Speaker 1: Okay I Hope you know what we're referring to Anis Charles You can find it on your own your big boys and girls But there's a few episodes like the one where they go into rogues backstory.

509
00:36:41,252 --> 00:36:43,924
Speaker 1: I think that was handled very well in the cartoon.

510
00:36:44,165 --> 00:36:45,250
Speaker 0: I don't remember any of it.

511
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:52,855
Speaker 0: All I remember is that I was the one cartoon that I watched every single week without missing it for a long time And then I eventually missed one.

512
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:56,130
Speaker 1: very few cartoons had that power over me ever in my life.

513
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,164
Speaker 1: Especially that was the only one up for me.

514
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:03,424
Speaker 1: It was that and Mask m dot a dot s dot K. It was better than transformers.

515
00:37:03,444 --> 00:37:05,110
Speaker 1: You can all fuck off and whatever.

516
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:05,676
Speaker 0: What do you know?

517
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:07,049
Speaker 1: not counting the transformers movie?

518
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,938
Speaker 0: which one I Think that is obvious.

519
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:12,864
Speaker 0: I know but there's two now.

520
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:13,710
Speaker 0: so you guys let's see.

521
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:20,783
Speaker 1: There's one that made me cry and there's one that had far more Humans in it than it needed and far less robots than it should have had.

522
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:21,425
Speaker 0: but you didn't see that.

523
00:37:21,465 --> 00:37:26,454
Speaker 1: second because I know better all right, and The Zelda cartoon.

524
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:36,190
Speaker 1: I mean, I like the Mario show Super Mario Brothers Super Show despite the fact that in retrospect That was one of the worst cartoons ever made not as bad as the link cartoon.

525
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:38,821
Speaker 1: The link cartoon is so much better than that.

526
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:40,810
Speaker 1: No, it's not as the only problem with it.

527
00:37:42,032 --> 00:37:48,190
Speaker 1: As Emily pointed out it exemplifies the 80s child because you know, there's like the 90s child, which is Zack Morris.

528
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:49,775
Speaker 1: I'm too cool for school.

529
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:50,538
Speaker 1: Check me out.

530
00:37:50,658 --> 00:37:51,040
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

531
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,541
Speaker 1: I'm so cool.

532
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:52,444
Speaker 1: Got spiky hair.

533
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:54,351
Speaker 1: Bart Simpson was kind of a part of that Too.

534
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:56,157
Speaker 0: yeah, it was the 80s child was.

535
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,582
Speaker 1: well, excuse me.

536
00:37:57,863 --> 00:37:58,947
Speaker 1: I'm a snotty little blah.

537
00:37:58,967 --> 00:37:59,830
Speaker 1: You're not the boss of me.

538
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:01,034
Speaker 0: Yeah problem child.

539
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:01,556
Speaker 0: Yeah.

540
00:38:01,897 --> 00:38:08,330
Speaker 1: Oh, you know problem child was a pretty terrible movie But it's got nothing on the worst movie ever made which is Clifford.

541
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,986
Speaker 1: I believe it involves Martin Short playing a ten-year-old boy.

542
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:11,570
Speaker 1: I'll leave it at that.

543
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,874
Speaker 0: I never saw or heard of that.

544
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:16,283
Speaker 1: It is the worst movie ever made.

545
00:38:16,484 --> 00:38:18,550
Speaker 1: I will stand by that statement to the grave.

546
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,038
Speaker 0: Even worse than mono sands of fate.

547
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:26,517
Speaker 1: mono sands of fate is kind of awesome because it went around Full circle and became awesome.

548
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:28,284
Speaker 0: even worse than the worst anime there is.

549
00:38:28,304 --> 00:38:29,710
Speaker 1: at least I can get it.

550
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:33,950
Speaker 1: There is no enjoyment to be had, you know, some things are so bad that they become awesome.

551
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:37,118
Speaker 1: This is so bad, but not that bad.

552
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:41,850
Speaker 1: it's just bad enough to be completely without redeeming qualities.

553
00:38:42,651 --> 00:38:47,870
Speaker 1: But yet it uh, it's one of the few movies ever just said fuck it and turn it off and never saw how it ended.

554
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:49,697
Speaker 0: Alright, so we decided to show an x-men.

555
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:52,990
Speaker 0: you were failing to find more to say about them because there's not that much to say.

556
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:54,026
Speaker 1: I don't like it that much.

557
00:38:55,392 --> 00:38:56,741
Speaker 0: It's the thing is it's weird.

558
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:57,103
Speaker 0: It's like.

559
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,836
Speaker 0: I like The characters and x-men.

560
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:03,047
Speaker 0: most of the characters anyway some more than others of all the.

561
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:05,501
Speaker 0: and when I was a kid I read and enjoyed x-men.

562
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:11,610
Speaker 0: and the x-men I read as a kid I now know is pretty bad right compared to like, you know now I can buy those big black books.

563
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,157
Speaker 1: I think one thing is the x-men.

564
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:20,386
Speaker 0: we read the character designs of all the superhero Underwear pervert stuff and those are the costumes that the underwear pervert fans hate the most of the ones that we had.

565
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:27,084
Speaker 1: but yet those Underwear perverts not counting like watchmen or all the I don't know more erudite superhero things.

566
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,270
Speaker 1: I like those character designs.

567
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:30,273
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

568
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,283
Speaker 1: they're not like the super muscley crap.

569
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:41,450
Speaker 1: We see sometimes and they're not So spandexy and stupid compared to later ones and they're not so lame compared to earlier ones.

570
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,276
Speaker 1: I I kind of like that aesthetic.

571
00:39:43,677 --> 00:39:44,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like.

572
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:46,687
Speaker 0: I still identified the x-men.

573
00:39:46,707 --> 00:39:49,780
Speaker 0: when I think about x-men I always think about those, you know, adjectivists.

574
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,149
Speaker 0: x-men number one Fox cartoon costumes.

575
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,840
Speaker 1: that Doesn't wear a stupid helmet.

576
00:39:55,122 --> 00:40:00,370
Speaker 1: He wears cool sunglasses Yep, or the Geordie LaForge kind of thing and he has his hair's always out.

577
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:00,953
Speaker 0: Well, he wears.

578
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:07,990
Speaker 0: he wears the the wide visor thing when he's gonna be in battle But he wears the red sunglasses the Ruby sunglasses when he's just walking around.

579
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:13,817
Speaker 1: He never just rips the Ruby sunglasses off like oh man, you know someone well Someone always takes them off his face.

580
00:40:13,837 --> 00:40:16,590
Speaker 0: Then he goes what the fuck did you do be always always all cool?

581
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:20,050
Speaker 1: He's just kind of like glances over him like No, you see what I did.

582
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:25,650
Speaker 0: That's more like what Superman does when he's using his heat vision, but he's Clark Kent right now And he's like I need to use heat vision while I'm Clark Kent.

583
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:34,937
Speaker 1: Anyway, see I really I do like an angel was a total wuss Turned into Archangel who was badass, but sad.

584
00:40:34,957 --> 00:40:39,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually, I like the villains in x-men a lot more than I like apocalypse my man.

585
00:40:40,212 --> 00:40:41,799
Speaker 0: It's all about Magneto and mr.

586
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,325
Speaker 0: Sinister sinister.

587
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:48,544
Speaker 0: I mean, he's just so sinister Sinister no, but in general I like the x-men.

588
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:49,970
Speaker 0: I like the characters in the x-men.

589
00:40:50,030 --> 00:41:01,995
Speaker 0: I have nostalgia for it and I did enjoy it reading it when I was a kid and all and I. I read some older x-men comics now and some aspects of those are still enjoyable, but some are still kind of hard to get through because they're so old and corny.

590
00:41:02,748 --> 00:41:13,357
Speaker 0: and It's kind of sad that nowadays it's impossible for me to really read x-men or find any ex new x-men that I can enjoy because it's like it's all.

591
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:19,706
Speaker 0: the x-men comics are so like Convoluted and twisted and like the x-men that I knew and loved or no longer.

592
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:23,502
Speaker 0: the x-men, you know It's they're all different people and there's all these extra characters in there.

593
00:41:23,543 --> 00:41:34,741
Speaker 0: and this crazy stuff happened And in order for me to figure it out I'd have to read like years and years and years worth of these comics of varying quality and it's It's and and what I would eventually get to.

594
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:43,890
Speaker 0: you know, even if I understood the new stuff It's not really what I want and it's kind of sad that there was like this this thing and now it's not there anymore.

595
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:45,956
Speaker 0: It's like this void almost of.

596
00:41:46,016 --> 00:41:49,427
Speaker 0: there's a thing I could enjoy but no one's making it right.

597
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:54,550
Speaker 0: I don't know There's that ultimate x-men, but I don't know really know what to think about that ultimate stuff.

598
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,054
Speaker 0: It's sort of sort of weird.

599
00:41:56,355 --> 00:41:57,298
Speaker 1: I've pretty much given up.

600
00:41:57,338 --> 00:42:00,066
Speaker 1: I'm gonna stick to reading that one Batman comic.

601
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:04,450
Speaker 1: I didn't read yet and Yeah, that's pretty much it at this point.

602
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:17,001
Speaker 0: But in general if you have never read x-men comics or maybe you know You don't think you've read like the important x-men comics go to the store and you know the big black books I haven't said mentioned for the third time this episode.

603
00:42:17,362 --> 00:42:22,090
Speaker 0: get a copy of essential X-men number two not essential uncanny x-men number two.

604
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,048
Speaker 0: That's the Stan Lee stuff.

605
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:31,710
Speaker 0: essential x-men number two is the Claremont burns stuff and that one big black book Has all the x-men comics that you need to read in your entire life.

606
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,603
Speaker 0: So get that black book and it's like between 10 and 20 dollars.

607
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:37,710
Speaker 0: You can probably get it on Amazon pretty cheap.

608
00:42:37,811 --> 00:42:39,243
Speaker 0: I'll even look it up while I'm talking.

609
00:42:39,263 --> 00:42:42,215
Speaker 0: and That is all the x-men you need to read.

610
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:47,150
Speaker 0: and I do recommend that anyone who cares about comics should probably read it.

611
00:42:47,371 --> 00:42:57,510
Speaker 0: I mean, it's got all those important kind of stories and this is a bit of corniness But not as much corniness as some older comics, you know, and it's it's good stuff.

612
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:58,364
Speaker 0: And then you'll see.

613
00:42:58,384 --> 00:43:00,316
Speaker 0: you know The x-men and why?

614
00:43:00,356 --> 00:43:08,303
Speaker 0: if you don't understand why people like the x-men now if you read this I think you will understand why people enjoyed the x-men back in the day.

615
00:43:08,825 --> 00:43:09,387
Speaker 0: Oh, it's $12 on Amazon.
