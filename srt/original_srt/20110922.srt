1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,379
Speaker 1: It's Thursday September 22nd 2011.

2
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,886
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:16,129
Speaker 1: We talk about weddings.

4
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:29,032
Speaker 1: Let's do this Much like Pinkie Pie.

5
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:30,240
Speaker 1: I like to party.

6
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:36,380
Speaker 1: I like to go to parties a lot, and it's funny that I like to go to parties a lot more.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,365
Speaker 0: They like to go to work.

8
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:38,371
Speaker 1: It's funny.

9
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:43,091
Speaker 1: How when we were in college We did not party like we very rarely had like.

10
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:44,034
Speaker 1: this is a party.

11
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:48,229
Speaker 1: we basically just hung out And did stuff or usually didn't do stuff.

12
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:49,895
Speaker 1: That's a party or just played games.

13
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:51,160
Speaker 0: How is that not a party now?

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,545
Speaker 1: Well see what I think of party.

15
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:54,173
Speaker 1: I differentiate it from hanging out.

16
00:00:54,213 --> 00:01:02,948
Speaker 1: when I say let's hang out I invite specific people to do something or I have a general invite, but no no agenda No, nothing, and I don't provide any food.

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:10,917
Speaker 1: to me party means wherever I am They're providing food and drink and a larger number of people possibly people.

18
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:11,840
Speaker 1: I don't know are invited.

19
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:13,817
Speaker 0: How many people makes a party?

20
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:18,862
Speaker 1: I think it depends more on whether or not the host is providing food and drink and Entertainment.

21
00:01:18,882 --> 00:01:22,093
Speaker 1: like is it provided entertainment or a provided thing?

22
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:23,920
Speaker 1: or are you just at their house?

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,519
Speaker 1: And you're stealing their orange juice when they're not looking.

24
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:28,499
Speaker 0: What if you come over to my house, and I pour you the orange juice?

25
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:39,615
Speaker 0: If you if it was planned ahead of time - is kind of important like if you said hey rim on Thursday come over you come Over to my house is just you and me and you've been but the orange juice is already poured when you show up.

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,123
Speaker 1: ah there's one more step.

27
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:57,034
Speaker 1: to make it a party it has to be not an open invite to the public, but a Generally either a generally open invite or some sort of RSVP system like and it has to be broken down like the family unit Or the friend unit group like if you say I

28
00:01:57,516 --> 00:02:02,879
Speaker 0: send you a written Invitation to come over to my house for orange juice and tomorrow and the orange juice is already poured and show up

29
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:04,528
Speaker 1: And that is party.

30
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:06,438
Speaker 0: okay even though it's two people.

31
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:11,638
Speaker 1: yes Okay, you can have a party with one person as we learned in my little pony, okay?

32
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:22,829
Speaker 1: There you go, so the trouble I had is that I for a long time was the one who was always hosting all the fucking parties Which means one.

33
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,099
Speaker 1: it costs a lot of money?

34
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,222
Speaker 1: and to Visigoths

35
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:30,601
Speaker 0: well, I mean the price of a party varies greatly But

36
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:37,929
Speaker 1: even a crap Oh party like when we like we had everyone for New Year's right and we want to have dinner for one That was a couple hundred bucks worth of catering

37
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:38,170
Speaker 0: yep,

38
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:41,180
Speaker 1: which was a lot more money to us back then than it is now.

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,883
Speaker 1: Well, that's your.

40
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:43,932
Speaker 0: I mean, that's no different than going to a restaurant.

41
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:45,277
Speaker 0: It's just you're paying for everybody.

42
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:50,220
Speaker 0: now If everyone you made everyone pay then it wouldn't be so expensive.

43
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:54,254
Speaker 1: But at the same time that's much more of a pain in the ass to manage it is.

44
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:57,706
Speaker 1: and also what if someone says no Then you can't get in.

45
00:02:57,947 --> 00:02:59,252
Speaker 0: and I found cover charge.

46
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:01,220
Speaker 1: I found something to pay me for the door bitches.

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,510
Speaker 1: That's right, but I found something more interesting.

48
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,800
Speaker 1: if you expect people to pay for the food Then they will have an opinion on what foods you get and you know what?

49
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,780
Speaker 1: I no longer have the patience in my life to deal with anyone's preferences on anything.

50
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:32,178
Speaker 0: Yeah even when I'm at a restaurant and there's people there I'm with or even people at an adjacent table that are strangers if They like have trouble ordering or have to like be like say oh don't do this You know, give me this without this ingredient, you know, and it's not for an allergy.

51
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,585
Speaker 0: it's like Dude, just pregnant order something.

52
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:35,709
Speaker 1: No, no to be fair.

53
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,740
Speaker 1: That's okay at crappy restaurants sometimes but it's a fine line.

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,803
Speaker 1: It's a really crappy restaurant.

55
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:40,786
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a limit Scott.

56
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:45,120
Speaker 1: if you're at McDonald's you're like, can I get extra sauce on this burger?

57
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,256
Speaker 1: It's like dude, come on.

58
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:52,736
Speaker 1: But at the same time if you're an ultra fancy restaurant You're paying that chef to do what he does best if you know better than him.

59
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:53,560
Speaker 1: Why you at his restaurant?

60
00:03:54,462 --> 00:04:01,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know I feel like it's okay to say yeah, can I not have bacon on the salad, please?

61
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:08,006
Speaker 0: Mostly it's you know, the.

62
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:16,336
Speaker 1: the annoyance depends on how much time you spend deciding true But when it comes to me providing food for people if I say like hey, we'll get catering.

63
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:17,440
Speaker 1: What do you all want?

64
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:27,920
Speaker 1: I believe that if I take my entire circle of friends and everyone gets to veto one and only one thing Every possible food will be vetoed except gruel and then no one will want to eat gruel.

65
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,924
Speaker 1: Yep, but you only get one veto people use their first.

66
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,670
Speaker 0: the first person to veto will veto gruel.

67
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:40,573
Speaker 0: that actually is a little before we get into the main topic and Then the other thing that person doesn't like is the one that's gonna get picked.

68
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:47,651
Speaker 1: before we get into the main topic I have a word of advice for all of you punk kids who are going through the steps We went through forming your own crews out there.

69
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:48,757
Speaker 1: eat all food.

70
00:04:49,038 --> 00:05:00,579
Speaker 1: Well Everyone will eat Mediocre lukewarm delivery Chinese, that's true because if you're ordering mediocre lukewarm delivery Chinese You're hungry enough to where it doesn't matter.

71
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:09,800
Speaker 1: But more importantly if you do have to order food as a group and it's pizza For example use the one veto system works very well.

72
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,184
Speaker 1: Just go around the room first.

73
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:20,663
Speaker 0: eliminate anything with allergies like celiac or whatever because you can't blame someone for at least You know, if you have enough people you're gonna be ordering multiple pizzas Chinese food.

74
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:31,188
Speaker 1: you're gonna order multiple dishes true, but if you're ordering like come you like even pizza though all right bigger people - maybe three pizzas if Through three people have specific requirements.

75
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,640
Speaker 1: You're kind of fucked already and one of those pizzas are gonna be plain cheese.

76
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,451
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't want one of your pizzas to be plain cheese.

77
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,380
Speaker 1: That means you failed as a group of friends.

78
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:43,580
Speaker 0: Just get one plain cheese and then get an extra meat pizza that you can have something.

79
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:48,040
Speaker 1: No, because if you have a friend who will only eat plain cheese pizza, what the hell that's true.

80
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,883
Speaker 0: Don't be that guy.

81
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:50,789
Speaker 0: unless you're allergic and you can't.

82
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:56,539
Speaker 1: you're allergic to everything in the world, but bread and cheese And sauce.

83
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:06,889
Speaker 1: But anyway go around the room pick an order and say everyone gets to veto one topping Mmm, you will be surprised how well that works.

84
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:19,066
Speaker 0: as long as the group is more than like four people and less than like 12 And as long as enough of your friends are reasonable because half the more than half of our people are like I veto nothing Yep, which makes it even easier.

85
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:23,519
Speaker 0: like, you know, and the thing is also, you know, everyone has tastes right?

86
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,181
Speaker 0: Like.

87
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,795
Speaker 0: I really like sausage or ham or pineapple on pizza.

88
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:34,340
Speaker 1: I love pineapple in general Yep, but I want fruit on the which is trouble because I my favorite kind of pizza is Hawaiian pizza.

89
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:35,188
Speaker 0: How is that your favorite?

90
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:35,693
Speaker 0: disgusting?

91
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,226
Speaker 0: It's awesome But it's like I'm not gonna.

92
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:42,100
Speaker 0: you know, sometimes they get a pizza with sausage and I just eat it anyway.

93
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:44,019
Speaker 0: Cuz I'm not a little baby.

94
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:46,786
Speaker 0: Don't be a baby.

95
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,574
Speaker 1: I feel like I can eat it.

96
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:50,060
Speaker 1: you would not eat a Hawaiian pizza?

97
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,603
Speaker 1: I don't think.

98
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:52,211
Speaker 0: probably not but it's like.

99
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:53,900
Speaker 1: no, you know what you would do with my answers.

100
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,663
Speaker 1: God, I know you.

101
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:58,802
Speaker 1: you just pick the pineapple and the ham off and then it's just a mediocre slightly wet pizza Maybe.

102
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:03,900
Speaker 0: but the point is I wouldn't cry and moan about it or do anything like that.

103
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:14,600
Speaker 1: This is a good exercise for you as the man up Of your group of friends to one assert your dominance by taking charge of the situation to by doing the game.

104
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:22,600
Speaker 1: You can now use mechanism design to influence the way your friends choose in order to get your desired outcome Which is no hassle one.

105
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:27,655
Speaker 1: You have to say because and quotes because I am sorting out the bullshit with the toppings.

106
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:28,939
Speaker 1: you picky-ass motherfuckers.

107
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:35,460
Speaker 1: Someone else has to call the pizza place And To use peer pressure.

108
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,515
Speaker 1: Someone's gonna be like I want to veto more than one thing and just peer pressure will end that.

109
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,785
Speaker 1: you can't say no go home Yep, get the fuck out.

110
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:46,212
Speaker 1: That's right, or maybe trade some futures.

111
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:50,681
Speaker 1: Like I will sell you my veto for $10.

112
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:54,260
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point of all this is that I really like parties but it sucks to run parties.

113
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:54,903
Speaker 0: No kidding.

114
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:58,059
Speaker 1: The answer is to go to other people's weddings.

115
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,549
Speaker 1: Shit because forget let's forget about the.

116
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,340
Speaker 1: you know, there's a whole discussion about whether or not or any sort.

117
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,159
Speaker 0: You know bar mitzvah is also good.

118
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,258
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much anyone else throwing a party at their expense if I'm going fuck.

119
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:12,900
Speaker 0: Yeah.

120
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,645
Speaker 1: so Weddings in particular.

121
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:18,693
Speaker 1: now, I don't really want to get into just yet the whole thing about.

122
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,820
Speaker 1: you know, diamonds aren't worth anything.

123
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,666
Speaker 0: or You can talk about how diamonds aren't worth anything.

124
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:24,509
Speaker 1: They're worth nothing.

125
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you know, you spent $80,000 on a wedding that you could have had for $20,000.

126
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:33,418
Speaker 1: if you just been a little more judicious in your plan.

127
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:35,549
Speaker 0: you spent $20,000 on a wedding.

128
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,198
Speaker 0: you could have spent two.

129
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:38,880
Speaker 0: What did you waste?

130
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,340
Speaker 0: $18,000.

131
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,888
Speaker 0: now granted I can imagine a $20,000 party.

132
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:53,440
Speaker 0: it would have to be a fucking week long Or it should I have to be one day a few days long, but you're paying for everyone's hotel rooms and transportation.

133
00:08:54,026 --> 00:09:00,139
Speaker 0: It could just be one day But one epic day and you're paying for their plane tickets or you're paying for a fucking cruise ship.

134
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,860
Speaker 1: to me $20,000 means you had a live band that is actually known by people who aren't you?

135
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,879
Speaker 0: Yes, as in you paid the appearance fee of a famous person for an hour.

136
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:14,356
Speaker 0: I know some famous people have appearance fees greater than that, but you can get a semi-famous purse.

137
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:15,460
Speaker 1: you can get c-list.

138
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,010
Speaker 0: Yes, definitely.

139
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:21,871
Speaker 1: You can get fucking B list you If they're local yeah, and they're a little desperate.

140
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,380
Speaker 0: you can also get tons of crazy shit.

141
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,143
Speaker 0: That's this you.

142
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:28,216
Speaker 0: you would not believe some of the party shit that is available out there.

143
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:35,519
Speaker 0: if you want to blow your money And there's a lot better ways to spend that party money then on Useless decorations you're gonna throw away.

144
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:38,040
Speaker 0: You know a DJ that's you know.

145
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,084
Speaker 0: You could just got.

146
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:43,763
Speaker 0: you could have bought a whole Serato system for the amount of money you spent on the DJ to do it For one day.

147
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:50,032
Speaker 1: Well, the key is to just get a friend to do it Mediocrally competent and it's not that hard in these.

148
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:51,760
Speaker 1: don't ask ab just go for it.

149
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like in the olden days.

150
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:54,955
Speaker 0: you needed someone with fancy equipment.

151
00:09:54,975 --> 00:10:02,690
Speaker 0: just about every DJ These days is an amplifier two big speakers and some sort of you know two laptops or two iPods and one make dude I?

Speaker 0: It's like really anyway What kind of dancers like you'll get dancers to go with the DJ.

158
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:23,560
Speaker 0: the DJ has dancers that you pay and they come with him.

159
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,547
Speaker 1: What I've never seen.

160
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:30,023
Speaker 1: that at any event on the level low enough to be something I would attend.

161
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:34,280
Speaker 1: that wasn't like some sort of like events like a media event.

162
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:43,497
Speaker 0: Yeah imagine if like you're going and you're gonna do the the horror or something or you're gonna do the electric slide and There's like dancers like leading everyone in the electric slide.

163
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,289
Speaker 0: you paid for them And they also go and they usually have like.

164
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:52,192
Speaker 0: they'll usually come with like two hot girls and two hot guys And they'll like drag people onto the dance floor who are the shy.

165
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:54,060
Speaker 0: Wow like that's their job.

166
00:10:54,422 --> 00:11:00,695
Speaker 1: I've never encountered professional party dancers I was picturing like backup dancers like just at the front of the room behind the DJ.

167
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:01,859
Speaker 0: no they like they.

168
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,364
Speaker 0: you know They're like the DJ's like right and left hand people but we don't.

169
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:21,160
Speaker 1: there have been a number of weddings in the crew and actually it's kind of fun that Weddings in the crew have more often than not been officiated by people in the crew and everyone in our crew Happens to know and be with both sides of the aisle bride and groom.

170
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:29,580
Speaker 1: So it's kind of like every wedding I've been to in most of my life has been all of my friends having a party on someone else's dime.

171
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:36,945
Speaker 1: Well, there's all these other people there at least recently Yeah, also family ones Family wedding.

172
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:39,260
Speaker 0: there haven't been a whole lot of weddings in my family.

173
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,770
Speaker 1: I've not in my lifetime been to two family weddings.

174
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:58,860
Speaker 1: one of them was my mom getting remarried Which was awesome because like all my friends from town just kind of showed up and ate the pig and Some friend of the family got married once and I just went and got really drunk because my parents kept giving me alcohol And all the middle-aged ladies kept giving me alcohol.

175
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,664
Speaker 1: And it was awesome.

176
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:07,335
Speaker 0: all the people in my family who are married were married before I was born My close family and none of the people of my generation.

177
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:21,819
Speaker 1: for me all the weddings I've been to have been the same like this the people I hang out with at the wedding of the same people I'd hang out With anyway, but yet there's a party and catered food and unlimited alcohol that I didn't pay for.

178
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,091
Speaker 0: Alright, but at the same time right.

179
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:46,469
Speaker 0: while it's awesome to go to someone else's wedding Most weddings are Unreasonably expensive and even reasonable ones are still somewhat unreasonably expensive now It is a lot of money to throw a party and I could understand you would want to throw a party and it costs a lot of money, but some people Overpaid notably on the aforementioned useless

180
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:47,010
Speaker 1: rocks.

181
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:53,819
Speaker 0: Yep, and useless one-time dresses and Tuxedo rentals and crap like that.

182
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:56,289
Speaker 0: And so sometimes what you know.

183
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,940
Speaker 0: wedding venues when you could have just had it in someone's backyard.

184
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,640
Speaker 1: Some venues could be worth it something nice enough.

185
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:04,644
Speaker 1: I mean venue.

186
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:07,858
Speaker 1: what one of our friends got married in a pretty rocking castle.

187
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,851
Speaker 0: actually Yeah, but I mean how much did the castle cost?

188
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:12,840
Speaker 1: actually my favorite party?

189
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,852
Speaker 0: It's like a castle is awesome party.

190
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:16,020
Speaker 0: I would totally party in a castle.

191
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,124
Speaker 1: The thing is my favorite part.

192
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,532
Speaker 0: how much would I pay to party in a castle?

193
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:26,960
Speaker 1: at the venue at night that we'd they let us Like use the venue all night long and we just had a bonfire and just sat around drinking.

194
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,651
Speaker 0: That was an excellent a venue that I'm sure was much less money than the castle.

195
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,519
Speaker 0: That was a very great venue excellent day.

196
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:36,920
Speaker 0: But you know, it's like, you know, I think our friends are the most part.

197
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,878
Speaker 0: I've had more weddings on the reasonable side of cost.

198
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:47,180
Speaker 0: Yeah most people Seem to spend a lot more money and also a lot of you will get ripped off because when they go to have a wedding.

199
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:54,360
Speaker 0: Right, it's like you go if you try going to get catering and then try to go get catering But let the caterer know you're having a wedding.

200
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:02,820
Speaker 1: Yes, like have like have two people called the same set of caterers for the exact same party But one of them says it's a wedding and one of them doesn't say it's a wedding.

201
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:06,551
Speaker 0: They charge you more because it's a wedding because of the same reason.

202
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:13,299
Speaker 0: funeral parlors charge you a ton of money because there's this Emotional grasp they have on you like it's your special day.

203
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,896
Speaker 0: Actually the same way you want your special day to be so great, isn't it worth it?

204
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:20,266
Speaker 0: your one special day You'll remember for the rest of your life.

205
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,296
Speaker 0: It's worth that extra five thousand watch.

206
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:23,060
Speaker 1: This is when I was a kid.

207
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:35,868
Speaker 1: I remember seeing this, you know back when local news did a lot more investigative journalism And I saw a local news thing where they went to flower providers, you know botanists, I guess not botanists florists Yeah, I don't know.

208
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:36,350
Speaker 1: I feel like you.

209
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,340
Speaker 1: into a botanist you get much more interesting flowers, maybe.

210
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:57,398
Speaker 1: Yeah so you go to a florist and what they did is they went to pretty much every florist in our area like in the suburb of you know Detroit and They would have one where a guy would go and say like he's doing it for some event and he wouldn't say what he'd say like some political function and a girl would go and say it was for a wedding.

211
00:14:57,418 --> 00:15:05,925
Speaker 1: a Guy would go and say it was for a wedding and they videoed with a hidden camera how the people treated these three different People trying to get flowers.

212
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:08,335
Speaker 1: if her girl went to a wedding it was literally.

213
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:09,640
Speaker 1: but it's your special day.

214
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:15,680
Speaker 1: These black roses are only a hundred thousand dollars more, but you'll only have one wedding.

215
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:17,708
Speaker 1: It's your special day.

216
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:20,720
Speaker 1: Yeah ripped off to the guy and this actually kind of pissed me off.

217
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,550
Speaker 1: They'd be like do you want her to be happy?

218
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:26,380
Speaker 1: How will your honeymoon be if she isn't happy?

219
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,788
Speaker 1: What if she regrets that you didn't get the better flowers?

220
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:30,992
Speaker 1: She'll know.

221
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:31,955
Speaker 0: you know, what?

222
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:33,840
Speaker 0: don't buy any fucking flowers.

223
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:38,620
Speaker 0: How are the power is gonna make the party any better or worse for the for the go to party fucking city?

224
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,610
Speaker 0: It's cheap and you can get some streamers and you know what.

225
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:44,320
Speaker 0: if you know how to work a streamer it can look fucking awesome.

226
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:47,822
Speaker 1: Actually, nobody's gonna complain at the wedding We just went to.

227
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:54,352
Speaker 1: I was very pleased that it was real flowers because having been in the wedding real flower if you're if you are Gonna get flowers real flowers are very important.

228
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:55,720
Speaker 1: Yes fake flowers.

229
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:01,465
Speaker 1: I've had fake boutonnieres before and let me tell you fuck those things also when you do get you know That sort of stuff.

230
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:07,208
Speaker 0: most of the problem with expensive shit at weddings Is that it's a useless or be one-time use.

231
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:17,036
Speaker 0: right dress is not useless, but it is mostly one-time use which is like Uh, but if you're gonna reuse that dress a whole bunch and it wasn't ludicrously expensive like this.

232
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,520
Speaker 0: wedding dresses for multiple thousands.

233
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:24,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you get a few hundred dollar wedding dress and you reuse it many times Dresses cost few hundred dollars.

234
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:26,049
Speaker 1: You say a few hundred dollars.

235
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,480
Speaker 1: I mean I've spent over four hundred dollars on an okay suit.

236
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:34,040
Speaker 0: I've been three hundred dollars in a coat and three hundred dollars in a kilt, but I get you sad of them.

237
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:39,352
Speaker 0: Yep, if I spent three hundred dollars on the coat and wore it once my whole life That would be fucking crazy.

238
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:41,443
Speaker 1: the most recent wedding We went to the bride.

239
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:46,000
Speaker 0: that would be like buying an Xbox and playing one game for four hours and never using the Xbox ever.

240
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:50,664
Speaker 1: I Scott bought a PlayStation 1 Sure, not that long.

241
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:52,590
Speaker 0: Did you use it for only four hours?

242
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,597
Speaker 1: I used it for only one day.

243
00:16:54,737 --> 00:16:55,540
Speaker 1: use it for one game.

244
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,364
Speaker 0: That's not the same.

245
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:59,800
Speaker 0: this dance dance revolution is wearing a dress for one day for four hours.

246
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,020
Speaker 1: It is telling that I put a mod ship in it before I'd ever plugged it in or turned it on.

247
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:08,262
Speaker 0: You know a ring with a diamond in it is a useless rock and also a work but first off.

248
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:16,037
Speaker 1: so The wedding we most recently went to the bride had actually an amazing dress like.

249
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:22,734
Speaker 0: it was pretty awesome Like it is hard for me to not be amazed But it also gets mad props for being it like, you know workable.

250
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,859
Speaker 0: a lot of people get you know.

251
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,295
Speaker 0: Especially women's fashion is often like high heels.

252
00:17:27,335 --> 00:17:32,714
Speaker 1: You cannot walk in them Yep, or a train so long that you need attendance to carry it right like they'll get stuff.

253
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:34,480
Speaker 0: That is not feasible clothing.

254
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,970
Speaker 0: It just doesn't work as clothing.

255
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,376
Speaker 0: but this dress worked.

256
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:39,180
Speaker 0: like you just walk around.

257
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:47,533
Speaker 1: yep, and I'm in general all of our friends who have gotten married have gotten pretty nice dresses that were either very cheap and Good-looking or will be reusable and we're just awesome.

258
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:49,883
Speaker 0: I haven't seen anyone reuse it yet though They'll see.

259
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:53,700
Speaker 0: watch for at least you know, if you can hand it down thing is we need.

260
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:56,229
Speaker 0: But the question is like if you were gonna hand it down.

261
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,219
Speaker 0: Why weren't you wearing the handed down one from your mom?

262
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,088
Speaker 1: Because styles change.

263
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,660
Speaker 0: yeah, okay big deal.

264
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,884
Speaker 1: Yeah, part of that is.

265
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:11,500
Speaker 1: I like how non-traditional like non-traditional ceremonies are way more fun to me than traditional old You know standard way.

266
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,685
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I hate tradition.

267
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:13,327
Speaker 0: in general.

268
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:16,460
Speaker 0: tradition is never a good reason to do something if it's the only reason.

269
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:27,193
Speaker 0: So if something is not a traditional way of doing something it automatically gets props for me no matter what Almost always and you know, I mean, all right, I'm beating flash now.

270
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:27,554
Speaker 1: You know what?

271
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:28,740
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be quick man first.

272
00:18:29,764 --> 00:18:30,678
Speaker 0: That's not a tradition.

273
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:44,300
Speaker 0: I'm saying that you know, if you're doing something and your only reason that you're doing something, you know Or the only reason you're doing something in a particular way is because of tradition that is usually a bad reason to do it.

274
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:52,960
Speaker 0: And instead you should figure out you know What is the best way to do something or the best thing to do regardless of any traditions that may exist?

275
00:18:53,362 --> 00:18:54,429
Speaker 1: But yeah under the rock.

276
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:57,692
Speaker 1: we've talked about this on geek nights a lot But not recently probably in like the 2006-2007.

277
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,178
Speaker 1: It's been a long time since we talked about this because in 2006-2007 for whatever reason that was just a hot issue for us.

278
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:07,164
Speaker 1: diamonds Mm-hmm fuck diamonds.

279
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:08,168
Speaker 1: They're worth nothing.

280
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:12,220
Speaker 0: Yeah people if you don't know right diamonds are worthless rocks.

281
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:17,997
Speaker 0: They dig them out of the ground for you know often with very harsh labor, but sometimes not.

282
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,751
Speaker 0: you can get it certified You know mined by not slaves if you want.

283
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:26,989
Speaker 0: it cost more though, of course And there's bajillions of them.

284
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:27,190
Speaker 0: It's.

285
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,540
Speaker 0: they're not rare in any way or shape or form.

286
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,600
Speaker 0: They're as rare as the rocks in your backyard.

287
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:37,705
Speaker 0: Not only that we can just fucking make them and I don't mean make them like oh, it's a kirby zirconia It's not really a diamond.

288
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:43,136
Speaker 0: No, we can make really a diamond never mind the fact that Genesis or other people you can make real diamonds.

289
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:47,277
Speaker 1: I defy Anyone who is not a jeweler to be.

290
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:50,972
Speaker 1: you know Walking down the street see a ring someone's got on and be like.

291
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:51,875
Speaker 1: that's not a diamond.

292
00:19:52,096 --> 00:19:53,200
Speaker 1: That's a cubic zirconia.

293
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,063
Speaker 1: I can tell by.

294
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,573
Speaker 0: you have to get real close to tell and you know what.

295
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:12,800
Speaker 0: in fact the fake ones or the ones that We make are usually better than ones that were randomly dug up out of the ground not to mention the fact that basically the reason diamonds are expensive is because the only people digging diamonds out of the ground is One giant company de beers and they put all the diamonds in a big safe in London.

296
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:25,379
Speaker 0: This safe has just a bajillion diamonds in it a bajillion bajillion and what they do is every once in a while They take a handful of diamonds out in like a briefcase and given to some jewelers and that's they have a very so.

297
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:29,420
Speaker 0: it seems As if the world is a very slow trickle of increased diamond supply.

298
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,427
Speaker 1: You don't need to take any of this on faith.

299
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:35,020
Speaker 1: a much better way to illustrate the truth as many documentaries and books.

300
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,890
Speaker 1: There's a very simple way take any piece of jewelry.

301
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,555
Speaker 1: That's legitimate as in.

302
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:48,160
Speaker 1: you know, it's a real diamond or whatever and get it appraised and See what they say like oh, this is worth X tens of thousands of dollars, right?

303
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:54,559
Speaker 1: So go to then go to any pawn shop or any jewelry store and ask them how much they will give you for it.

304
00:20:55,841 --> 00:21:04,979
Speaker 1: there will usually be a couple orders of magnitude difference between the quote appraised value and The value anyone in the world is actually willing to give you for it.

305
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, GameStop right is is not even close to how jewelry goes right.

306
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:10,720
Speaker 0: you think GameStop is ripping you off.

307
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:20,110
Speaker 1: If you want a really nice ring and you actually for whatever reason wanted to be real Get a used ring from an estate sale.

308
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,273
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

309
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:26,849
Speaker 0: other good ideas number one Don't get any rare metals or gems whatsoever.

310
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:30,960
Speaker 0: get something else such as maybe someone on Etsy will make you something, right?

311
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:32,706
Speaker 0: Why do you even need rings?

312
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,011
Speaker 0: It's because it's a tradition.

313
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:35,296
Speaker 0: Maybe you can do something else.

314
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,360
Speaker 0: Maybe not do anything.

315
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:42,242
Speaker 0: maybe get necklaces or earrings or Nothing or tattoos or You got to give.

316
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:49,225
Speaker 1: you got exchange sets of D&D dice, it's a good deal.

317
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:50,910
Speaker 0: hewn from something.

318
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:55,060
Speaker 0: you'll use excellent computer mice keyboards find something to exchange.

319
00:21:56,824 --> 00:22:04,650
Speaker 1: If I saw a wedding ceremony where they exchanged an IBM AT keyboard and like a DOS keyboard That's my wedding.

320
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:12,240
Speaker 0: That's A kind of lame anyway.

321
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:19,527
Speaker 0: and but the thing is you can still if you really want to if you have some emotional attachment to do with rings or Jewelry or something like that.

322
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,757
Speaker 1: Seriously, you can at least get something.

323
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,170
Speaker 0: Valuable diamonds are worthless, but you know what?

324
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:32,850
Speaker 0: gold platinum especially Emeralds rubies all are actually rare and valuable.

325
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:37,587
Speaker 0: as long as they don't have blood on the rubies can be Manufactured - they can be.

326
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:39,755
Speaker 0: but they're still actually somewhat rare and valuable.

327
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:49,851
Speaker 1: and as long as they don't blood on them the thing is I feel like a resin jewel of any kind is a Fully functional equivalent for just about any jewel in almost any situation.

328
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:58,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can also get you know, various polished stones I mean my class that are not the shiny gems But you know stone from high school, by the way punk kids many of you are in high school.

329
00:22:58,622 --> 00:22:59,947
Speaker 1: Don't buy your class ring.

330
00:23:00,027 --> 00:23:00,670
Speaker 1: You'll regret it.

331
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,280
Speaker 1: You'll never look at it again after your freshman year of college.

332
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:07,275
Speaker 1: Yep, if your parents try to make you buy it ask them to give you cash instead.

333
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:14,491
Speaker 1: Yep Seriously worthless rocks, but my class ring looks really nice.

334
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:16,457
Speaker 1: It has all gigantic fake.

335
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:20,128
Speaker 1: general general You know what mine - looks fine.

336
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:29,166
Speaker 0: Well, I got the India cut - gigantic fake I guess clear jam, which I it's not really diamond clear That was I guess I don't know.

337
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:32,960
Speaker 1: I got I got a green one because I liked emeralds and I also like green.

338
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,292
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, and what was on the side of your class ring.

339
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:40,593
Speaker 0: one side had like a rocket ship That was like 2000 and the other side had a computer.

340
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:44,490
Speaker 1: Ah mine We had a dragon, but one side was a trumpet.

341
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:45,253
Speaker 0: All right.

342
00:23:45,353 --> 00:23:51,335
Speaker 1: Yeah trumpet and a French horn and it said brass Brass and the other side was the dragon dragon.

343
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:55,499
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't No, never never doing.

344
00:23:57,342 --> 00:24:06,957
Speaker 0: But yeah, what else you know, mainly just in general most people Spend way too much wet money on weddings bar mitzvahs and other sorts of parties than they should.

345
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:11,052
Speaker 0: they could have a lot more Fun for a lot less money just like I think it would.

346
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:12,117
Speaker 0: then it was it a thing of the day.

347
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:18,439
Speaker 0: once these people on Reddit we're gonna have their wedding in a mansion and the guy who owned the mansion Canceled on them at the last minute.

348
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:21,352
Speaker 0: So they that they went on reddit and they said help us.

349
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,140
Speaker 0: reddit said have it in a field.

350
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,739
Speaker 0: They called up their uncle who had a farm.

351
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:30,960
Speaker 0: They had the wedding with some bouncy castles on the field of the farm for nothing because it's the uncle's field.

352
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:41,600
Speaker 0: They had horses that were just there so people pet the horses and It was the amazing wedding that cost almost nothing compared to the mansion that they were gonna pay a fortune for.

353
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:46,179
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's just you know, it's like nothing wrong with having a party.

354
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:48,970
Speaker 0: Getting married is a good occasion to have a party.

355
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,320
Speaker 0: any occasion is a good occasion to have a party.

356
00:24:51,703 --> 00:24:53,840
Speaker 0: How about we have a party about getting up or going to sleep?

357
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,092
Speaker 0: Those are good reasons, but if you're gonna have any party, it doesn't matter what the reason.

358
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:00,840
Speaker 0: don't spend moronic amounts of money on it.

359
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:02,113
Speaker 0: Make it reasonable.

360
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:12,240
Speaker 1: Hmm Though in terms of maximize fun going to weddings money spent I have noticed many things and that now I have having a wedding most recently on the mind that I actually find kind of interesting.

361
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:15,373
Speaker 1: You can tell the Masters from the professionals.

362
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:16,579
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

363
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:22,240
Speaker 1: the a Master will drink a lot of alcohol in the course of the wedding.

364
00:25:22,781 --> 00:25:24,828
Speaker 1: The professionals are lined up.

365
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:29,060
Speaker 0: everyone who's not a teetotaler like me will drink a lot of alcohol during any wedding.

366
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,046
Speaker 0: If the bar is open.

367
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,613
Speaker 1: they do not line up before the bar is open.

368
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:35,740
Speaker 1: the alcoholics line up before the bar is open.

369
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,368
Speaker 1: Let's see professionals appear out of nowhere.

370
00:25:38,648 --> 00:25:40,153
Speaker 1: The second the first drink is poured.

371
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:42,480
Speaker 1: Yep ceremonies over there in line somehow.

372
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:43,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't know how they got there.

373
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:44,528
Speaker 1: It's uncle Jim.

374
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:45,834
Speaker 1: He's 400 pounds.

375
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:47,159
Speaker 1: How did he beat you there?

376
00:25:50,081 --> 00:26:02,213
Speaker 1: The middle-aged people the fathers and the mothers and the younger grandfathers and the uncles will be Surprisingly all touchy-feely with the spouses of all their friends male and female.

377
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:14,518
Speaker 1: I've noticed that every wedding I've been to hmm, which is Only horrifying until you get old and then it's kind of awesome The ceremony will have some amount of derpitude in it.

378
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:22,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is no way to not have some amount of derpitude because it's really hard to treat anything seriously Anything especially.

379
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:29,656
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter what culture you are or anything You know, I guess maybe the incredibly seriously religious can keep it serious.

380
00:26:29,676 --> 00:26:30,800
Speaker 0: the whole time though

381
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:52,460
Speaker 1: I was very proud of our friend Nury because there were readings during the wedding we just went to and she read a speech from Babylon 5 and rather than changing the names of all the Languages and races to be real ones just to make the speech kind of normal It was a reading about the Minbari and such and the fact that she did it super cereal was kind of amazing.

382
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:55,280
Speaker 1: I almost cracked up and I was standing up there just trying not to laugh.

383
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was just looking at a rim the whole time.

384
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,220
Speaker 0: He was making his don't laugh face.

385
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:07,160
Speaker 0: I was like don't laugh where he makes his mouth completely fat But you get flat but you can see the corners going up and sometimes you can see the corners going down really firmly.

386
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:14,370
Speaker 0: Yeah as he wins as he starts to win against his fight You'll see my cheekbone stick out as my.

387
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:30,992
Speaker 1: I clench my whole jaw followed by Our friend Pete - Every wedding he's officiated has been way nerdy.

388
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:33,039
Speaker 0: He's making use of his church universe.

389
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:44,497
Speaker 0: Oh, by the way, when you need someone to officiate your wedding, right if you're not religious and you don't you know Want the wedding to be about God instead of being you might know a captain a captain's.

390
00:27:44,517 --> 00:27:44,858
Speaker 0: a good idea.

391
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:54,913
Speaker 0: But basically, you know, even if you are religious, right if you go and get your wedding officiated by a religious person what ends up happening most of the time is How well do you know that person?

392
00:27:54,953 --> 00:28:01,268
Speaker 0: maybe you know You're really churchy and you're really good friends of the minister and they know you and you see him every week And you actually talk to him.

393
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,559
Speaker 1: then yeah, go for it.

394
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,288
Speaker 0: But a lot of times people go and they get married by like, you know The priest or whatever and you barely know this guy.

395
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:16,580
Speaker 0: you just go to that church once or twice a year for the important times You're supposed to go or the rabbi, you know, you go to the Jewish temple on the High Holidays.

396
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:27,162
Speaker 0: You don't really know the guy so the wedding ends up being you know, the official yating tends to be generic More about God than about you, even if you believe in God You.

397
00:28:27,262 --> 00:28:36,654
Speaker 0: so I would suggest even if you do believe in God to try to get people You know to do it and not some person doesn't know you people about you.

398
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,820
Speaker 1: He did a really good job at this one.

399
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:40,620
Speaker 1: He's done all their weddings too in our crew.

400
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,360
Speaker 0: All right, the point I was really trying to make is Pete does it because he got the thing from the universal life Church.

401
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:48,059
Speaker 0: I also got it which you can get if you just you know.

402
00:28:48,341 --> 00:28:54,732
Speaker 0: If you need someone to officiate pick the person and if they can't do it Send them to the universal life Church where they can get this thing.

403
00:28:54,812 --> 00:28:55,716
Speaker 0: that lets them do it.

404
00:28:55,917 --> 00:29:05,789
Speaker 1: nice aside I I joined the universalized life Church a long time ago and whenever I get hotel rooms or reservations for anything I put Reverend as my title.

405
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,740
Speaker 1: Yeah one time this saved my bacon.

406
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:14,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were at between packs East the first packs East and anime Boston.

407
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:19,760
Speaker 1: They were like opposite weekends, so we just stayed in Boston the whole week and did a whole bunch of awesome shit.

408
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,462
Speaker 0: That was good times.

409
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:25,097
Speaker 1: I accidentally had one of the hotel reservations a day too long in.

410
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:28,095
Speaker 1: for all of our travels I would have been out like 200 bucks.

411
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:32,815
Speaker 1: So I called him up and I'm like, hey, can I just cut this short?

412
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:46,180
Speaker 1: I know I'm past the deadline And at first I like no no, no, no, no, but then she the lady on the other end pauses and say oh Reverend give me a moment and then the manager comes on lines like Reverend to cost her.

413
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,292
Speaker 1: We've made all the arrangements or anything else I can do for you.

414
00:29:48,614 --> 00:29:52,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Yeah, being a reverend is kind of awesome.

415
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,752
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's oh, by the way I hereby forgive all the sins of every everyone who hears this right now.

416
00:29:58,194 --> 00:30:02,190
Speaker 1: if you're in the universal life Church I don't know even if you're not the power to do that.

417
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:02,591
Speaker 1: There you go.

418
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:04,740
Speaker 0: But what if they denied the Holy Spirit?

419
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,603
Speaker 0: They can't be forgiven.

420
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:06,126
Speaker 0: You know what?

421
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:06,950
Speaker 1: That's fine.

422
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,216
Speaker 1: There's no at least if they're Christians.

423
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:12,152
Speaker 1: There's no Holy Spirit And if you believe and if you suddenly believe there is one for you.

424
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:13,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is just for you.

Speaker 0: Okay, and you're married.

428
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:23,849
Speaker 1: No Yeah, you're all married to each other.

429
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:24,372
Speaker 1: That's right.

430
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:25,357
Speaker 1: Good luck sorting that one out.

431
00:30:25,438 --> 00:30:27,618
Speaker 0: everybody one big blob.

432
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,864
Speaker 0: It's it's marriage instrumentality.

433
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:32,388
Speaker 1: Yep wedding cakes.

434
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,311
Speaker 1: I don't know.

435
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:39,678
Speaker 1: I'm a fan of the traditional wedding cake actually flavor wise Like that white wedding cake I really like.

436
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:46,280
Speaker 1: But every wedding I've ever been to had shit-ass ice cream.

437
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:47,964
Speaker 0: That's true.

438
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:49,813
Speaker 0: They don't use expensive ice cream.

439
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:51,380
Speaker 1: They use the cheapest possible.

440
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,989
Speaker 0: I mean ice cream is real expensive to get good stuff in bulk.

441
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,544
Speaker 1: Also forget that this reminded me of the things that piss me off one.

442
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:02,315
Speaker 1: I Know there's that stupid tradition where like the bride or groom shove the cake in each other's faces.

443
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:02,817
Speaker 1: It's stupid.

444
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:03,239
Speaker 1: Don't do it.

445
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:04,427
Speaker 0: Okay, do.

446
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:14,293
Speaker 1: if you ever Take a fork and bang it against the glass because you think that's cool I hope you take the fork in your eye.

447
00:31:14,313 --> 00:31:15,580
Speaker 1: I just I hope you die.

448
00:31:15,982 --> 00:31:18,516
Speaker 0: Yeah, that needs you not clink the glasses.

449
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:31,405
Speaker 0: you can however If you are drunk run your finger around the top of the glass that saying that is awesome That's okay but no clicking with your silverware to get them to kiss if I'm ever getting married somehow and There's clinking going on.

450
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:32,268
Speaker 1: I'm ignoring it.

451
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:33,151
Speaker 1: I'm just sitting there.

452
00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:34,797
Speaker 0: No, you should kick whoever clinks out.

453
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:35,720
Speaker 1: No, I'll just wait.

454
00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:39,499
Speaker 1: I'll stare them all down Fluttershy style give him the finger.

455
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:54,940
Speaker 1: however One person and only one person in all of history gets forgiven for clinking for Scott Johnson who was getting married was dancing with his mom Which is both an inside joke and literally what was going on and someone starts clinking.

456
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:56,451
Speaker 0: That was an appropriate joke.

457
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:56,813
Speaker 1: that was.

458
00:31:56,854 --> 00:31:57,700
Speaker 1: that was fantastic.

459
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:04,423
Speaker 1: That was kind of like how when the cake came out they play the portal song and you know It's lame.

460
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:05,687
Speaker 1: to make a cake is a lie joke.

461
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:11,368
Speaker 1: unless there is literally a cake and some sort of like truth about it That can be revealed.

462
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:14,524
Speaker 0: Yep What are the things?

463
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:16,752
Speaker 0: there's a lot, you know, there's a lot of small things out there.

464
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:18,539
Speaker 0: actually I'm a big fan of the.

465
00:32:19,422 --> 00:32:28,980
Speaker 0: You know, I said I don't like traditions, but I actually like the throwing and catching parts Because it is like a sport and I think weddings need more sport like activities.

466
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:35,240
Speaker 0: I know that like a kids bar mitzvahs usually and you know, I guess also what are the the confirmation parties and things?

467
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:43,880
Speaker 0: They'll do things like play games such as Coke and Pepsi and whatever which are kind of dumb games But at least they're like structured sport like activities.

468
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:55,073
Speaker 0: I think more weddings need like, you know, like I said the bouncy castle maybe some kickball dodgeball Gladiator jousting X. Yep, those things they do the sumo suits.

469
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:59,630
Speaker 0: I'm a big fan of all those things Especially because remember it's a wedding party activities.

470
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,413
Speaker 1: It's a wedding.

471
00:33:00,774 --> 00:33:05,294
Speaker 1: It's gonna be you and all your friends and All of your middle-aged drunk uncles.

472
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:07,564
Speaker 0: Well, that's another thing I'm not in favor.

473
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:12,240
Speaker 0: usually these parties even if they're not weddings you are charged based on the number of people.

474
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:23,880
Speaker 0: I am NOT in favor of inviting people you do not know Right, it's like people they'll invite like a distant cousin like your mom's second cousin someone you maybe saw once or twice in your life.

475
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,506
Speaker 0: Right, you know, they exist.

476
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:27,031
Speaker 0: Maybe I use.

477
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,360
Speaker 1: those people are not invited by the people who are getting married.

478
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,989
Speaker 1: They're invited by the family members.

479
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people, right?

480
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,223
Speaker 0: I know like your parents will pay for the wedding and stuff like that because they're so traditional Right.

481
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:42,214
Speaker 0: It's like don't don't let them do that shit.

482
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:43,820
Speaker 0: take control of your own shit.

483
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:46,939
Speaker 0: Do it the way you want to do it invite who you want to invite.

484
00:33:46,979 --> 00:33:51,379
Speaker 0: now Some people will be like, oh they're play this game where it's like, well, the person's gonna give a gift.

485
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:56,024
Speaker 0: So if it costs less to invite them than the gift they give It's a good deal.

486
00:33:56,346 --> 00:33:59,037
Speaker 0: Listen, it's not about getting, you know profiting.

487
00:33:59,057 --> 00:34:04,300
Speaker 0: if you want a profit You could have taken all the money you spent on this party and invested it in a business or something, right?

488
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:05,765
Speaker 0: You're not looking to profit.

489
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:07,011
Speaker 0: you're looking to have an awesome party.

490
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,337
Speaker 0: don't invite schmucks.

491
00:34:08,357 --> 00:34:11,159
Speaker 0: You don't know They're not gonna help your party be any better.

492
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:15,273
Speaker 0: I only invite people you know and actually care about to your thing.

493
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:19,187
Speaker 0: and even if that's not a lot of people who cares That'd be more fun without those other people there.

494
00:34:19,688 --> 00:34:23,364
Speaker 0: They're just gonna you know, and plus those people you don't know We're always a risk.

495
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:24,206
Speaker 0: It's all.

496
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:42,020
Speaker 0: there's always someone who's maybe you know is taboo or Makes trouble or something and it's that distant guy that you know, it's like the drunken second third uncle grandpa's Third brother, I have a feeling that the majority of drama at weddings comes from the closer relations.

497
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:45,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can't not invite the closer relation to the party.

498
00:34:46,138 --> 00:34:55,840
Speaker 1: That's like Yeah, well one of our friends weddings They did the traditional Chinese like challenges for the groom like he had to beat all the bridesmaids at something or we couldn't get married.

499
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:56,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fun.

500
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:58,934
Speaker 0: Yeah, anything that is fun regardless, you know.

501
00:34:59,094 --> 00:35:03,631
Speaker 0: when I said, you know, I don't like tradition It's not you know You're only doing something because it's tradition.

502
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:14,847
Speaker 0: that's the problem like the chair if something also Good, if something is good and in tradition will do it because it's good not because it's you know tradition though I have a very important admission to make.

503
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:15,771
Speaker 1: poop came out of my mouth.

504
00:35:16,112 --> 00:35:16,755
Speaker 1: I should talked.

505
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:20,893
Speaker 1: I broke a vow All right, you might remember some time ago on geek nights.

506
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:21,857
Speaker 1: I went to a wedding.

507
00:35:21,897 --> 00:35:22,560
Speaker 1: It was a fine wedding.

508
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:34,520
Speaker 1: I was in the I was one of the groomsmen But I had to rent a tuxedo and just due to the logistics of renting that tuxedo It was an unholy nightmare that consumed like eight total hours of my life.

509
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,356
Speaker 1: Yep, so I vowed I would never wear a tuxedo again unless I owned it.

510
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,391
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I ended up renting a tuxedo for this wedding.

511
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:44,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's another bullshit, right?

512
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:55,440
Speaker 0: It's like people have these weddings and they want all the like the people in the wedding party to wear like the same Clothes and they'll force you to go and rent a tuxedo or something, but they'll make you fucking pay for it.

513
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,440
Speaker 1: I got around that I deducted the cost of the tuxedo from my gift nice.

514
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:00,887
Speaker 1: I had a gift I'd planned.

515
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:03,037
Speaker 1: I saw the cost of the tuxedo and I deducted it.

516
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:18,357
Speaker 0: Good job I even told him as much I was like minus cost of tuxedo nice, but it's like, you know, I If you can't make someone else pay for your party, right a party is either Everyone pays collectively or one person pays.

517
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:19,080
Speaker 1: if I bring you know What.

518
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:25,460
Speaker 1: if you had a game where people the losers had to pay for the at least it's a fair some fair structure, right?

519
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:35,440
Speaker 0: It's if I'm having a New Year's party I can't be like, alright, listen you ten people who are close to me You're all gonna pay for part of this but all these other people are gonna get in the party for free.

520
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:38,020
Speaker 0: Well, do I get any benefits for paying for extra in this party?

521
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,266
Speaker 0: No, in fact you get a penalty.

522
00:36:40,286 --> 00:36:42,636
Speaker 0: you have to wear these horribly fitting ugly clothes.

523
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:49,677
Speaker 1: Ah The closest thing to a benefit was like we got drink service while we were doing all the pictures independent of the professionals in line.

524
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:54,131
Speaker 0: a Few minutes of extra drink service when there's unlimited drinks now.

525
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,900
Speaker 1: great now there's unlimited drinks to a time.

526
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,292
Speaker 0: Would you have paid the cost of the tuxedo for that drink service now?

527
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,099
Speaker 0: No, yeah, so you got ripped off.

528
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:04,949
Speaker 0: You can't make someone else pay for your shit.

529
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:08,840
Speaker 1: if you want people to do something for your party I point out that they'll all do it anyway.

530
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:11,088
Speaker 0: That's only because they feel obligated.

531
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:16,853
Speaker 0: I would be like, you know, if you ask me I'd be like fuck you Which is why I was gonna which is why nobody asked me.

532
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:18,440
Speaker 1: I was gonna to get around that.

533
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,948
Speaker 0: It's the same as in the the.

534
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,060
Speaker 0: you know, it's I attack only one.

535
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,906
Speaker 0: Nobody will fuck gang up on me.

536
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:31,849
Speaker 1: because they know I was going to consider getting the fancy utila kilt the dress one and wearing that Under the red the top of the tux.

537
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:32,572
Speaker 1: that would have been cool.

538
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:34,340
Speaker 1: then I would have kind of gotten around my shit talk.

539
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,484
Speaker 0: I had to match the tux.

540
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:36,649
Speaker 1: It would have matched pretty well.

541
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:37,030
Speaker 1: I like.

542
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:41,788
Speaker 1: I kind of specked it out, but I The utila kilt nice like.

543
00:37:41,808 --> 00:37:43,736
Speaker 1: they're already a little overpriced, but I like they're.

544
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:44,720
Speaker 1: they're good for what they ours.

545
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,603
Speaker 1: That's why I own a couple.

546
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:50,920
Speaker 1: but the fancy utila kilt is not worth the 800 whatever dollars.

547
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:51,743
Speaker 0: I didn't know.

548
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:52,787
Speaker 0: I thought the fancy utility.

549
00:37:52,808 --> 00:37:53,591
Speaker 0: It was actually cheaper.

550
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:55,037
Speaker 1: No, it's pretty expensive.

551
00:37:55,057 --> 00:38:06,920
Speaker 1: That sucks $750 fuck that for basically a Skirt and it's even less utila kilty than the real utila kill.

552
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, we talked about you know money spent on clothing versus the number of times and how often you're gonna use it.

553
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:19,323
Speaker 1: I spent three by two more of the fanciest kilt they've got rather than the tuxedo Money left.

554
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:21,992
Speaker 0: I spent 300 plus on a kilt that I use often.

555
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:27,831
Speaker 0: the tuxedo one cost twice that and I would use it Far far far less often.

556
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:29,477
Speaker 0: so it is a bad idea.

557
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:34,039
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, but yeah parties are awesome.

558
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:39,334
Speaker 0: Just make them reasonable and don't blow your whole money because of a tradition.

559
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:43,740
Speaker 0: use it on something reasonable instead Like, you know a vacation something worthwhile.

560
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,530
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
