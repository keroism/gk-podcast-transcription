1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,985
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, July 7th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:10,185
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:11,890
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,580
Speaker 1: tonight We are reviewing the phenomenal odd taxi.

5
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:26,779
Speaker 0: Let's do this All right, so a few months ago, I guess my dishwasher is making a noise still washing.

6
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:30,679
Speaker 0: It was washing the dishes perfectly, but it was making a noise, right?

7
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,197
Speaker 0: So I put in a repair request of the building like you do with the app.

8
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:35,880
Speaker 0: That's our fans.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,504
Speaker 1: Oh, you have an app.

10
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:37,027
Speaker 1: I just have to go.

11
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:44,659
Speaker 1: I have to get literally go down and talk to the doorman And then they'll usually hand me this special piece of paper like a carbon copy for but I got to fill out the form.

12
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:46,324
Speaker 0: Anyway, we got an app.

13
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:49,659
Speaker 0: So we also have an app that tells us when packages come in all kinds of stuff.

14
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,399
Speaker 0: They have an app Marion.

15
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:54,661
Speaker 0: Yeah, we do So.

16
00:00:54,701 --> 00:01:03,178
Speaker 0: then what happened is the day they actually got a dishwasher repairman like they like, okay The person's coming and I'm like, okay and no and it definitely didn't make the noise.

17
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:10,409
Speaker 0: now The day before the person came the noise went away, so I said listen the noise went away You don't bother me, right?

18
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,799
Speaker 0: So they said okay, they cancelled it.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,067
Speaker 1: It brought the noise back.

20
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:15,769
Speaker 1: That's how this works.

21
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,475
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, it's obvious right.

22
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,860
Speaker 0: a couple weeks later noise comes back.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,640
Speaker 0: So I finally put in a repair request and so today they said they said oh, we're gonna come look at it tomorrow.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,446
Speaker 0: So I said they're like, what time should we come?

25
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:27,850
Speaker 0: I'm like anytime, you know, whenever.

26
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:30,558
Speaker 0: of course today the super comes at 9 a.m.

27
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:38,625
Speaker 0: Sharp, I'm like, all right I said anytime come on in but Like at work.

28
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:41,056
Speaker 1: if someone says if I ask hey when can I schedule this meeting?

29
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:46,949
Speaker 0: and they say anytime That means anytime I'm like, all right, at least you're here.

30
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:48,014
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna turn you away.

31
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:50,828
Speaker 0: coming in check out the dishwasher You know, it made the noise.

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,277
Speaker 0: it reproduced its noise.

33
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:59,060
Speaker 0: nice They basically I think all they really did was like just open it all up and clean it out and close it again.

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,405
Speaker 0: I haven't it.

35
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:01,448
Speaker 0: they got it to go.

36
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,439
Speaker 0: then they we didn't test the full cycle of it because that you know.

37
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:10,520
Speaker 0: I got to get some dirty dishes and whatnot, but it didn't make the noise on the first cycle anymore.

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,646
Speaker 0: It made a different noise.

39
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:12,873
Speaker 0: So I guess that's an improvement.

40
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:15,645
Speaker 0: Yeah We'll find out when I actually.

41
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:23,472
Speaker 1: I guess the problem is you're not as much enough nor am I of a dishwasher expert to know If the new noise is better worse the same like.

42
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:24,356
Speaker 1: think about all the noise.

43
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:25,219
Speaker 1: I'll know for sure.

44
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:26,323
Speaker 0: I'll know.

45
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:32,225
Speaker 0: I think the noise it was making was a little weird because it was when they when they when we tested it It was completely empty of everything.

46
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:32,767
Speaker 0: No racks.

47
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:33,309
Speaker 0: No dishes.

48
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:42,825
Speaker 0: So the water was like loud against the edges of the dishwasher, right but anyway, the Interesting part right was not.

49
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:47,038
Speaker 0: you know, this minor dishwasher maintenance is that I learned a few things.

50
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:54,459
Speaker 0: number one I didn't know that if the dishwasher is like, you know There's no way to like skip cycles and just make it do whatever you want.

51
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:58,940
Speaker 0: But if it's in the middle of washing apparently you can just push the start button a whole bunch.

52
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:00,124
Speaker 0: It'll drain all the water out.

53
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:06,327
Speaker 1: I told you that when you complained about the noise on geek nights multiple times I explained that procedure.

54
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:09,240
Speaker 1: That's the quick way to test if there's a problem with the dishwasher.

55
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:13,260
Speaker 0: Well, anyway, the second thing is that in my kitchen, right?

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,379
Speaker 0: You know, yeah cabinets, right and there's a space between the cabinet and the floor, right?

57
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, and usually there's some sort of like, you know, I don't know what you call it right like a piece of welding.

58
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:30,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, just a flat thing underneath, you know, so that you like, you know, isn't just a gaping space underneath the cabinets.

59
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,988
Speaker 0: So ours, I guess there's like a piece of metal.

60
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:33,792
Speaker 0: It's like all shiny.

61
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:35,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, our dishwasher has a piece of metal there.

62
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:37,346
Speaker 0: Well, I mean our whole.

63
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,431
Speaker 0: it's not our dishwasher.

64
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,060
Speaker 0: It's the entire kitchen.

65
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:47,860
Speaker 1: I just have like one down there except for the dishwasher is the dishwasher has its own Piece of metal that goes in that the refrigerator has its own piece of plastic.

66
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,783
Speaker 0: But the entire kitchen other than the oven which goes all the way to the floor is ours is on the floor There's.

67
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:53,916
Speaker 1: no there's nothing down there.

68
00:03:54,761 --> 00:04:02,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the under the cabinets there is just a piece of metal that just goes all the way around with a space where the Oven is interesting.

69
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:08,018
Speaker 0: they just reached in as soon when they came and they just grabbed it and yanked it off.

70
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,245
Speaker 0: and I'm like I didn't know.

71
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,340
Speaker 0: I thought it was like part of the cabin.

72
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:19,962
Speaker 0: It was just a big sheet of plastic with that shiny on one side and had three and there were three claws on it And the claw.

73
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:30,762
Speaker 0: the cabinets had feet like little like adjustable feet and the claws were just clipped onto the feet and as a whole world underneath the cabinets of filth and I was like Fucking.

74
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:33,092
Speaker 0: tell me that I could have been cleaning under there this whole time.

75
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,197
Speaker 0: Look how disgusting it is.

76
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,809
Speaker 1: Clean under there store stuff under there.

77
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,235
Speaker 1: It's in New York any space counts.

78
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:38,456
Speaker 1: Yeah.

79
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,293
Speaker 0: Well, yeah So a I got this new space in my apartment.

80
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:49,246
Speaker 1: I just increased my square footage But I know what I would put under there the sleep mats for camping cuz you got to leave them unrolled or they get shitty.

81
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:53,669
Speaker 0: well be Now I can clean under there.

82
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,100
Speaker 0: But see now I have to clean under there.

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,739
Speaker 1: You know you could do when that when the when the plastics back in place just never speak of it again.

84
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:05,368
Speaker 0: Well, no now I know how to take it off.

85
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:08,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm saying you don't have this terrible gnosis.

86
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:13,091
Speaker 1: Walk away just if anyone's like what's under there.

87
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:17,204
Speaker 1: you're like a nothing nobody knows You know.

88
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:19,008
Speaker 0: just to wrap up the anecdote.

89
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:21,895
Speaker 0: so there we have these in the bathrooms.

90
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:24,040
Speaker 0: we have these floor heaters, right?

91
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,482
Speaker 0: We've never.

92
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:28,235
Speaker 0: we've never used them in theory.

93
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,300
Speaker 0: They could be nice, right?

94
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,701
Speaker 0: It's like you.

95
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,127
Speaker 0: imagine the cold bathroom floor.

96
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:37,050
Speaker 1: turning on see the problem is our building is so warm from its natural Business that the bathroom floor is always warm.

97
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:38,917
Speaker 0: I've never needed them, right?

98
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:39,700
Speaker 0: We've never turned them.

99
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,400
Speaker 1: Those are the guys that you want in like a house that has on a motor hotel or something.

100
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:46,105
Speaker 0: So they're there.

101
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,853
Speaker 0: but we never use them ever not even once.

102
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:53,686
Speaker 0: but the one that's in one of the bathrooms Right doesn't actually work.

103
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:55,393
Speaker 0: It's supposed to like show a clock.

104
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:56,397
Speaker 0: It shows an error message.

105
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,360
Speaker 0: Uh-huh So I'm like, oh while you're here come look at this error message and he's like, do you actually use this?

106
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,484
Speaker 0: And I'm like no.

107
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:04,911
Speaker 0: and he's like, yeah, you really shouldn't use it.

108
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,780
Speaker 0: There's no reason to you have a floor mat in there.

109
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:08,028
Speaker 0: It's like the floor is never cold.

110
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,094
Speaker 0: What the fuck do you need this for?

111
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:10,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just wasted.

112
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,852
Speaker 0: He's just like it'll just waste a lot of electricity and cost you money.

113
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:14,560
Speaker 0: and yeah, that's a piece of shit.

114
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,203
Speaker 0: Just ignore it.

115
00:06:15,364 --> 00:06:16,148
Speaker 0: and he's like, don't worry.

116
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:18,680
Speaker 0: He won't charge you if you move out and I'm like, I'm not moving out.

117
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:21,294
Speaker 1: That's good to know.

118
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,347
Speaker 0: He also was very amazed.

119
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:26,057
Speaker 0: The watermelon knife was out and he was like, what's that knife for?

120
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:26,880
Speaker 0: I'm like watermelon.

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,867
Speaker 0: He thought that was really great.

122
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,297
Speaker 0: He was amused at my watermelon.

123
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:37,040
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, one time we had someone coming into a maintenance at an air conditioner and they were real excited about all the audio equipment.

124
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:44,410
Speaker 1: Here I was explaining like oh, yeah, that's the microphone I use for the podcast and that's a different kind of microphone And these two microphones work different ways.

125
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,860
Speaker 1: and I ended that guy doesn't work at our building anymore But I later on I ended up giving him the old geek night's mixer as a gift.

126
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:54,334
Speaker 0: Cuz I'll buy a watermelon knife for the super.

127
00:06:54,535 --> 00:07:03,464
Speaker 1: Yeah So, uh in that there's a bunch of news we'll talk about some of these briefly some of them longer than others, but One little one.

128
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:07,880
Speaker 1: Scott told me about this and I know more about it than him because I skimmed an article.

129
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:13,036
Speaker 0: Whoa, all I heard was a rumor and I was like, oh I heard this I heard this rumor whisper.

130
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:15,809
Speaker 0: That sounds true Let me just mention it.

131
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,820
Speaker 0: and barely rim found more information.

132
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:27,425
Speaker 1: Yeah So that the article is titled after years on a weird island the x-men are finally superheroes again and I click on this.

133
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:28,227
Speaker 1: and what I see?

134
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:32,702
Speaker 1: because usually if I see an x-men comic and this has been for like most of My adult life.

135
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:35,473
Speaker 1: I don't know what the fuck is going on on that cover.

136
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:43,040
Speaker 1: I don't recognize half those characters But I look at this and it looks like the x-men that I know I see a Wolverine.

137
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:45,088
Speaker 1: It's a lady Wolverine, but it's a Wolverine.

138
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:46,896
Speaker 1: It's a superhero comic.

139
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:49,688
Speaker 1: So it's very obvious It's a lady Wolverine, but I digress.

140
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,371
Speaker 1: there's.

141
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:51,155
Speaker 1: I see a rogue.

142
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,360
Speaker 1: the rogue looks like the rogue.

143
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,828
Speaker 1: I know I see an old-school Jean Grey.

144
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:00,266
Speaker 1: I see a Cyclops with a normal Cyclops shit going on It just it looks like the x-men.

145
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:05,575
Speaker 1: I have not seen a man that looked like the x-men in a long time and it's x-men number one.

146
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:09,031
Speaker 0: Yep, I asked me how many x-men number ones are there?

147
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:09,813
Speaker 0: right so many.

148
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:11,580
Speaker 0: that would be a good tribute number one.

149
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,694
Speaker 1: I would be a good tribute.

150
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:13,160
Speaker 1: question.

151
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:14,487
Speaker 0: X-men number one.

152
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:17,060
Speaker 0: ultimate x-men number one get everyone to raise their hands.

153
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,996
Speaker 1: How many x-men number ones are there in the history of the x-men?

154
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:25,143
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, apparently, you know x-men comics I know that.

155
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:26,710
Speaker 0: you know, some people have said that they're.

156
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:34,059
Speaker 0: they have been doing interesting stuff lately Even though I haven't read one in for fucking ever right or at least I've read ones recently.

157
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,678
Speaker 0: But they were old ones whoever I haven't read a new one.

158
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,155
Speaker 1: Oh, wow, apparently this the weird island stuff is going on for like two years.

159
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,240
Speaker 1: I guess they were all living.

160
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, all the mutants are on the island of Krakow.

161
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,310
Speaker 0: It was all this weird stuff going on.

162
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:51,500
Speaker 0: I think there were even vampires at one point.

163
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:52,407
Speaker 0: I don't know when that was.

164
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,980
Speaker 0: someone's probably gonna tell me is five years ago.

165
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,119
Speaker 1: There's been like three different times where there were vampires, but I feel like one of those was a what-if.

166
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,104
Speaker 0: But and there was.

167
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:01,068
Speaker 0: there was a sword thing.

168
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:03,198
Speaker 0: I think right sort of thing.

169
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,686
Speaker 0: It was an x-men sword thing.

170
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:07,190
Speaker 0: I don't know what the details are.

171
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:22,084
Speaker 0: But apparently just today's Wednesday, which means new comic book day And so x-men number one, I believe came out today and it's the most Normal what you expect x-men to be x-men Based on what I've heard.

172
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,231
Speaker 0: I haven't read it in a long time.

173
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:29,801
Speaker 0: So if you're someone who likes x-men Maybe now's the time for x-men I'm.

174
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:35,769
Speaker 0: what I think I'm gonna do is I'm gonna wait six to twelve months and buy the trade of X-men number one through six.

175
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,658
Speaker 1: All right, so they have a note here in the article.

176
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,849
Speaker 1: there is there any required reading.

177
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:49,400
Speaker 1: all of the X titles are heavily connected, but X-men number one is an accessible introduction that doesn't get bogged down in this big thing.

178
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:54,054
Speaker 0: Okay, so it's it's one, you know, these times come around now and then right.

179
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,659
Speaker 0: so now is one of those times.

180
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,823
Speaker 0: Last month's your shot.

181
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:12,420
Speaker 1: x-men number 21 featured the debut of the new x-men team at the Hellfire Gala apparently and The team responsible for this new x-men number one was responsible for planet x-men number one.

182
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,088
Speaker 0: You know, I like a space x-men.

183
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:17,754
Speaker 0: that's how the best x-men is in space.

184
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,280

Speaker 0: I don't fucking know.

188
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,100
Speaker 0: I just assumed the word planets in the title.

189
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,673
Speaker 0: It must be like in space planet size x-men.

190
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:29,498
Speaker 1: Are they just Giants?

191
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:29,880
Speaker 1: I don't know.

192
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:34,839
Speaker 1: Anyway someone if you care about the x-men you can look at this news.

193
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,854
Speaker 1: That is all I got to say other than that.

194
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:40,346
Speaker 1: It looks like the x-men I know and rogue is like.

195
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:42,394
Speaker 1: rogue is just the Fox x-men rogue.

196
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:46,667
Speaker 0: Yeah Another tiny news, right?

197
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:53,087
Speaker 0: So it's not video game day on geek nights, but as GDQ is ongoing right now.

198
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:55,252
Speaker 0: I've seen some awesome runs.

199
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:58,460
Speaker 0: the Mexican runner did the battle toads turbo tunnel.

200
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:00,158
Speaker 1: Oh, I gotta watch that later.

201
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:08,607
Speaker 0: someone today did a Geo guesser speed run Where they had to guess.

202
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,009
Speaker 0: they had to do five perfects, you know Couldn't be off by more than like five meters.

203
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,640
Speaker 0: If you don't know a Geo guesser is go watch it and you'll see.

204
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:21,872
Speaker 0: And of course once they're doing it on as GDQ live, right?

205
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:23,437
Speaker 0: They get the worst possible ones.

206
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:24,500
Speaker 0: They give them a hard time.

207
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:28,479
Speaker 0: They're like, no, not a buja Nigeria.

208
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:37,791
Speaker 0: Yeah GQ is gonna go from is still going and it will.

209
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:39,397

00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:39,940
Speaker 0: It's gonna end.

211
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,531
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, the finale is on Sunday at like 2 a.m.

212
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:43,691
Speaker 1: At 11.

213
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:44,735
Speaker 1: Yes on Saturday.

214
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:50,209
Speaker 0: Yeah Effectively, but also their YouTube channel is the.

215
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,545
Speaker 0: their automatic pipeline of going from stream to YouTube is functioning I think better.

216
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:54,707
Speaker 0: it's.

217
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:58,929
Speaker 0: it's been functioning well in the past But it is functioning now better than it ever has.

218
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,678
Speaker 0: like soon after a run ends the.

219
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:05,980
Speaker 0: you know The clipped out video of that run is on YouTube, correct on their channel.

220
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,500
Speaker 1: Like it's good to know cuz I pretty much very rarely do I watch these actually live.

221
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,577
Speaker 1: I usually watch the VOD on YouTube as soon as it's there.

222
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:19,755
Speaker 0: And also, of course you can donate to MSF and also, you know, they always have their donation prizes.

223
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:36,360
Speaker 0: if you donate at least $250 in total over the course of the entire SGD Q you gain effectively one raffle ticket at most Which is eligible for you to win many prizes that change over time, but one of the prizes is a kick-ass gaming PC.

224
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:43,766
Speaker 0: But that kick-ass gaming PC has an RT Whatever a geforce 3070.

225
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:48,059
Speaker 1: No, they're giving away a geforce 3070 that has a bunch of shit attached to it.

226
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:49,444
Speaker 0: That's right.

227
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,472
Speaker 0: The computer might be better than the computer.

228
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:51,874
Speaker 0: I have.

229
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:55,917
Speaker 1: I doubt it's better than anything I've got but I guess I upgraded more recently than you.

230
00:12:57,001 --> 00:13:01,559
Speaker 0: It's like it's like a brand new like top-of-the-line AMD Ryzen, whatever AMD.

231
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:04,167
Speaker 0: That's the best one.

232
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,657
Speaker 0: It's probably faster than my computer.

233
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:09,506
Speaker 0: The point is $250 for a raffle ticket.

234
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:10,730
Speaker 0: It's like what you're donating.

235
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,085
Speaker 0: So you're not even losing if you lose and if you win, oh How did I miss this f-zero one?

236
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:17,790
Speaker 1: I got to watch that later snake.

237
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,100
Speaker 1: There's a lot of all tracks GameCube the GameCube one.

238
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:22,506
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's.

239
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:23,535
Speaker 0: but they've done that one before.

240
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:25,645
Speaker 0: but they did Do snaking before.

241
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:26,608
Speaker 1: maybe just didn't watch it.

242
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:27,250
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm stupid.

243
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:30,300
Speaker 1: I don't remember doing snaking on every track.

244
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:32,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of good ones.

245
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,694
Speaker 0: So check them out.

246
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:37,308
Speaker 1: I could snake on like One track in that game.

247
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:38,333
Speaker 1: I never got good at that game.

248
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:40,482
Speaker 1: That game was so hard Mm-hmm.

249
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:42,788
Speaker 1: So some other little news.

250
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:53,680
Speaker 1: There's two things going on with MAPPA the studio right now the anime studio One of which is good news, but there's a big asterisk on that good news because of the second news.

251
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:59,176
Speaker 1: So yep Chainsaw Man, which we reviewed didn't finish reading it, obviously, but Chainsaw Man.

252
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:00,620
Speaker 0: I've read the latest volumes though.

253
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:02,528
Speaker 1: Ooh, I'm a volume behind.

254
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:03,793
Speaker 0: It's uh, I think I'm in volume.

255
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:05,440
Speaker 0: I think I read five volumes.

256
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,417
Speaker 1: I think I continue to enjoy Chainsaw Man quite a bit.

257
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:23,507
Speaker 1: And a Chainsaw Man anime is coming and what I'm gonna link to is the news where MAPPA debuted the footage recently like last week Chainsaw Man's first trailer is as gory as you'd hope And that's what I wanted.

258
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:28,508
Speaker 1: Chainsaw Man if it's an anime has got to make Castlevania look like Child's Play.

259
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:29,893
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to be Apocalypse Zero.

260
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:40,200
Speaker 1: That's a whole different brand of things no one should watch but Chainsaw Man's gotta have an appropriate amount of gore and blood to do justice to those two-page spreads in the manga.

261
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:48,080
Speaker 0: The only thing that I worry about with Chainsaw Man is that like I really need you know They're collecting pieces of the gun devil, right?

262
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:57,440
Speaker 0: So if it ends up being an Inu Yasha Situation I'm not gonna like it but I call eventually I give up on it if it just takes too long.

263
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:15,696
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if they can manage to make it something that you know ends after a reasonable number of volumes Right or at least wraps up the gun devil plot and goes on to a second plot or something like that Because it's like, you know, if I don't get a gun devil payoff by like volume 20, it's like Long to hold out whatever

264
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:16,039
Speaker 1: happens.

265
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:24,021
Speaker 1: There has to be a moment where I turn the page and the deal with the gun devil is the kind of thing like in sanctuary Where I go Oh dip when I turn the page Yeah, it's like.

266
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:27,212
Speaker 0: I think I gave up on one piece after like 17 volumes.

267
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:29,259
Speaker 1: Maybe right you made it further than me.

268
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:30,870
Speaker 1: It was the fish man.

269
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:31,839
Speaker 1: I ended you.

270
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:33,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, I finished.

271
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:37,619
Speaker 0: it was like I. the fish man fight was going on for too long So I stopped buying it.

272
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,838
Speaker 0: But then I had already pre-ordered the next volume and that was the volume where the fish man fight ended.

273
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,372
Speaker 0: that Reminded me that I liked one piece, but I was like, nope.

274
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:46,576
Speaker 0: It's in two volumes.

275
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:48,002
Speaker 0: It's gonna be another fish, man I'm done.

276
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:57,859
Speaker 1: The problem is I actually was trying to read read like a few weeks ago randomly I was reading like a spoiler sort of like synopsis of one piece just to see like oh, where did the show go?

277
00:15:58,701 --> 00:15:59,633
Speaker 1: But and that was okay.

278
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,907
Speaker 1: The problem for me was much like the wheel of time.

279
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:08,085
Speaker 1: the synopsis itself was so long that I couldn't be bothered to finish reading.

280
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:09,843
Speaker 0: I Don't need to.

281
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,271
Speaker 0: I need to know what happened in between.

282
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:12,720
Speaker 0: just tell me what the one piece is already.

283
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,643
Speaker 0: That's all I want to know.

284
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,169
Speaker 0: I literally want to see a sentence.

285
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:19,648
Speaker 0: That is the one piece is what friendship love Draw, I don't know whatever.

286
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:21,420
Speaker 0: That is literally gold.

287
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:24,511
Speaker 1: It's the first piece of a puzzle.

288
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:26,839
Speaker 1: and then they have to go after the second piece.

289
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:29,087
Speaker 0: Like I don't care what it is.

290
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:29,932
Speaker 0: Just tell me what it is.

291
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:33,871
Speaker 1: I was a joke in English God, we used to anime cons every time we talked about one pose.

292
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,220
Speaker 1: I would always show the best pirate boat ever.

293
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:41,700
Speaker 1: I'd always show those anime openers the Italian one-piece opener, but I always made the same joke gum gum fruit.

294
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:46,544
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't care something always stage in a different way, but always be blah blah blah I don't care about Luffy.

295
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:51,960
Speaker 1: to part two the quest for the second piece and always get like an okay laugh from the audience.

296
00:16:53,281 --> 00:17:02,568
Speaker 0: So what I kind of what I kind of wish is that you know almost every store, you know fictional story out there Where there's some kind of treasure, right?

297
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,314
Speaker 0: It's like there's always some sort of catch.

298
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:07,244
Speaker 0: right genie, you know He always screws you on them wishes.

299
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:09,772
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know how they do those genies though.

300
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,387
Speaker 0: I wish that the one piece is just like Immortality invincibility.

301
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:13,669
Speaker 0: it's good.

302
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:14,453
Speaker 0: It's perfect and great.

303
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:15,839
Speaker 0: You're king of the world and everything's awesome.

304
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,512
Speaker 1: It's like one of the swords you find at the end of Final Fantasy 4.

305
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:19,895
Speaker 1: You're just like.

306
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,319
Speaker 1: well, that's the Ultima weapon.

307
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,371
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just fucked that one piece.

308
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,682
Speaker 0: I hope it's just fucking awesome Unbelievable.

309
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:28,057
Speaker 0: no catches no tricks is just the greatest.

310
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:28,901
Speaker 0: the end You know what?

311
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,203
Speaker 0: It's like.

312
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,652
Speaker 0: and then Luffy was was the the Pirates?

313
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:32,997
Speaker 0: there were no bad pirates.

314
00:17:33,077 --> 00:17:39,100
Speaker 1: ever again The very end everybody out and he looks at it and no one watches.

315
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:46,117
Speaker 1: He'll can tell what the hell it is and he it just zooms in and it just says the heron spear Yeah, something like that, right?

316
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,800
Speaker 1: So I put an asterisk on that news because I'm legitimately excited about a chainsaw man anime and the fact that map is doing it.

317
00:17:54,205 --> 00:18:02,320
Speaker 1: It's a big deal but We know that the anime industry in Japan doesn't pay shit to the animators.

318
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:13,070
Speaker 1: Nope, like and you got to work long ass hours and poor conditions and get paid almost nothing and like you think that like it's Bad, but it's so much worse than even the American animation industry.

319
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:15,438
Speaker 0: in terms of just work life is already bad.

320
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:24,040
Speaker 1: Yep, and Turns out mapa is paying way below even the paltry market rates in Japan today.

321
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,440
Speaker 0: So it's already.

322
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,791
Speaker 0: Anime is already unethical.

323
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:30,640
Speaker 0: This is like double unethical anime.

324
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:31,302
Speaker 0: It's like.

325
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:38,100
Speaker 0: it's like the difference between the factory where they make the iPhones and the other factory that has you know, Uyghur labor.

326
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's even worse.

327
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:44,279
Speaker 1: I got I got a lady that yeah, there's another story I didn't want to talk about just cuz I haven't I didn't read enough yet.

328
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:54,095
Speaker 1: But I saw a story last night around how Chinese studios are Poaching Japanese animators by offering and basically triple salary if they'll come to China and animate.

329
00:18:54,115 --> 00:19:04,280
Speaker 0: and there's a whole thing going on with that Which could if you want to animate and you don't mind going to China, you know, and honestly What I'd when I say the numbers like I wouldn't go to China for any money.

330
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,693
Speaker 0: But you know some people would well considering how desperate you might be.

331
00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:10,043
Speaker 1: So here's the numbers from the article I'm gonna link to.

332
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:25,015
Speaker 1: so the the going rate which is Garbage tier in Japan right now is about 40 US dollars per cut like a cut of animation 40 bucks, which is basically like being paid like a 7-eleven like hourly employee.

333
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:44,189
Speaker 1: Yeah Mappa is paying as low as $34 a cut right now and In the article the person they interviewed said the rate that this should be which would already be pretty low should be $134 a cut.

334
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:46,140
Speaker 0: that that even still seems low.

335
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:53,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like a hundred and thirty four dollars will get you like, you know an illustration from a furry fan artist.

336
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:56,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the last time I commissioned that doesn't even move.

337
00:19:56,411 --> 00:20:03,958
Speaker 1: the last time I commissioned some Animatics like a minute worth of animatics was like four ish hundred bucks.

338
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:07,986
Speaker 0: So Yeah Seems way low.

339
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,440
Speaker 1: so excited about chainsaw man anime.

340
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:20,333
Speaker 1: But I live in a society and I have to recognize that the chainsaw man anime is unethical Even by the standards of the Japanese animation industry to date.

341
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:28,260
Speaker 1: It's it's it's double unethical Yeah, and it's hard to say what to do about this because this is like it's not like animation or animates.

342
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,946
Speaker 0: You destroy cat McCrush capitalism.

343
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:33,478
Speaker 1: Yep, like, you know often we talk about like how we're communists.

344
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:34,884
Speaker 1: We're not kidding Like.

345
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:35,728
Speaker 1: that's not a joke.

346
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,798
Speaker 1: That's not even an exaggeration in my case.

347
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:56,609
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's a you know, the thing is you have communism and people think of like, you know The Soviet Union and it's like listen the Soviet Union's, you know problem was a they didn't have the computers and technology of now Which would have helped, you know Managing an economy

348
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,258
Speaker 1: irrational weird behavior of the?

349
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:04,200
Speaker 1: u.s Did not help them have a healthy alternative government and also autocracy, right?

350
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,848
Speaker 0: I want communism with democracy.

351
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:09,015
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, that's the combo right.

352
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:13,292
Speaker 0: and it's like we've had this You know cold war going on and both sides.

353
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,156
Speaker 1: both sides lost.

354
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:18,371
Speaker 0: what I would argue Yeah, both sides had one part right and one part wrong.

355
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:23,065
Speaker 0: It's like we got to combine the good part over here Right and arguably.

356
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,498
Speaker 1: arguably America was not even close to a democracy until maybe.

357
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,728
Speaker 0: of course Yeah, but the point of course not.

358
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:32,556
Speaker 0: but at least there it wasn't, you know autocracy.

359
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:33,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was something.

360
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll put it this way is more day.

361
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,937
Speaker 1: I am a communist voting.

362
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:37,500
Speaker 0: that happened.

363
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,125
Speaker 1: I am NOT a Soviet.

364
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,429
Speaker 1: We're not tankies.

365
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:43,720
Speaker 1: Like that's a whole other like weird mess of bad ideas.

366
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:45,749
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

367
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:58,300
Speaker 0: So in some other news All right, the Godzilla thing Yeah, so there's a Netflix anime that's been out for like a little while now But I just happened to watch it cuz I had it was raining, right?

368
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,463
Speaker 0: So I watched an anime.

369
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:02,012
Speaker 0: so going outside there was rains going on.

370
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,260
Speaker 0: So it was Godzilla singular point.

371
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,620
Speaker 0: It's one of those Netflix original animes, right and you might think man you guys are talking about a lot of Netflix original anime.

372
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,591
Speaker 0: See, well, that's yeah, cuz I'm subscribed to Netflix right now.

373
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:13,139
Speaker 0: I only subscribe to one thing at a time.

374
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:19,574
Speaker 0: Eventually, I'm gonna run out of Netflix Unsubscribe and switch to something else and you're gonna be hearing nothing but HBO max shows.

375
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:21,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like HBO max.

376
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,683
Speaker 1: There's a winner.

377
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:24,960
Speaker 1: We're all gonna park our subscriptions cuz they picked up like fucking everything.

378
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:26,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is not like some.

379
00:22:26,686 --> 00:22:30,440
Speaker 0: I don't want anyone to think that there's some favoritism here between streaming services.

380
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,822
Speaker 0: It's just.

381
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:32,470
Speaker 0: I'm only subscribed to one at a time.

382
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,500
Speaker 0: Although I am always subscribed to crunchyroll at all time.

383
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,814
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm always crunchyroll And that's because crunchyroll has an annual payment thing.

384
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:41,455
Speaker 0: if they did the monthly thing I would do the same switching.

385
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:48,300
Speaker 1: now Our household is crunchyroll and Disney Plus and then whatever service has the things we're watching which right now is no thanks.

386
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:51,252
Speaker 0: So I watched all of Godzilla singular point.

387
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:53,260
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have watched it all.

388
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:55,673
Speaker 0: I would have only watched some of it if it wasn't raining.

389
00:22:55,694 --> 00:23:03,862
Speaker 1: Yeah This sounds like this review is about to be like my review of all those anime I watched when I was living alone in Poughkeepsie Maybe.

390
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,950
Speaker 0: so, I mean, it's not a bad show, right?

391
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,851
Speaker 0: It's it's some of the animation is really kind of awesome You know.

392
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:17,420
Speaker 0: if you like Monsters, you know, there's some really cool monster animation and monster scenes going on.

393
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:28,517
Speaker 0: I do like monsters and there's you know, the aspect of that sort of like, you know Fantastical sci-fi aspect of like trying to figure, you know, everyone's trying to figure out like why do the monsters work?

394
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:29,340
Speaker 0: What's the deal?

395
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,424
Speaker 0: How do we stop them?

396
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:34,080
Speaker 0: right, you know everywhere the monsters go there's like these red dust everywhere.

397
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:35,107
Speaker 0: What's the deal with that?

398
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,160
Speaker 0: right and the humans are trying to figure it out, right?

399
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:44,800
Speaker 0: And it's also got lots and lots of callbacks to you know, the series of Godzilla movies, right?

400
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:54,440
Speaker 0: So it's like if you are familiar with got the you know All the Godzilla creatures and monsters and you know things like Jet Jaguar, right the robot.

401
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:55,743
Speaker 0: It's like you'll.

402
00:23:56,004 --> 00:24:04,377
Speaker 0: there's a lot of you know, basically direct references that will sort of tingle your nostalgia, whatever, right.

403
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:15,620
Speaker 0: The negatives of this show I think is it a While there's the characters are like some of the characters have good designs and good personalities and are interesting.

404
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:19,271
Speaker 0: There is no character like development.

405
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,726
Speaker 0: It's just like this character is who they are Right.

406
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:24,017
Speaker 0: watch them do what they do.

407
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:30,097
Speaker 0: And it's like they don't have like an like an arc of like growth or change or anything.

408
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,632
Speaker 0: It's like this character is an old man who likes robots.

409
00:24:34,953 --> 00:24:36,780
Speaker 0: He's an old man who likes robots at the start of the show.

410
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:41,263
Speaker 0: He's an old man who likes robots at the end Place for that.

411
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,109
Speaker 0: it's like this girl.

412
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:46,700
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, she's the the science research girl, right?

413
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,722
Speaker 0: It's you know, who's who's figuring everything out and she's that at the start of the show and she's that at the end of the Show.

414
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,810
Speaker 0: she doesn't have any.

415
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,160
Speaker 0: there's no human conflict.

416
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,880
Speaker 0: The conflict is the humans versus the science to solve the you know, Godzilla monster problems, right?

417
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,367
Speaker 0: That's that's the central conflict of the show.

418
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,775
Speaker 0: and the second problem in the show.

419
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,260
Speaker 0: Is that the science problems?

420
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,170
Speaker 0: And some people have said I have watched this I watch these sub diversion.

421
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:15,540
Speaker 0: people were saying that the dub is great.

422
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:19,999
Speaker 0: that's what people said so I'm inclined to believe them because they're people I trust.

423
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,467
Speaker 0: and And While watching the show with subtitles, which is what I did.

424
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:33,859
Speaker 0: There's a lot of just like nonsensical science blah blah blah blah blah Right prop for now and prop for now and prop for now and sentences that don't make sense.

425
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,997
Speaker 0: Mistranslations of like, you know.

426
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:40,981
Speaker 0: Like poems like, you know, it's like, you know they're like.

427
00:25:41,062 --> 00:25:55,060
Speaker 0: they got the tiger tiger poem in there right with the fearful symmetry as like a reference several times symmetrical tiger on fire Right and like, you know, that's a thing that was originally in English, but the subtitles got it wrong, right?

428
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,584
Speaker 0: It's like.

429
00:25:56,193 --> 00:25:56,599
Speaker 0: it's like what?

430
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:02,135
Speaker 0: But so people said the dub is actually more sensical.

431
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:03,460
Speaker 0: so that may be true.

432
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,845
Speaker 0: So maybe try the dub.

433
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:10,909
Speaker 0: if I guess if you're watching with subtitles and you get to a part We're like the subtitles like make no sense.

434
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,154
Speaker 0: Like what the fuck did they just say?

435
00:26:12,174 --> 00:26:12,596
Speaker 0: I don't know.

436
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:13,419
Speaker 0: that means nothing.

437
00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:17,254
Speaker 0: Maybe rewind a little bit and turn on the dub and see what they say.

438
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:18,739
Speaker 0: Maybe it makes more sense.

439
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:29,071
Speaker 0: But yeah it's like if the central point of the show is like this humans versus science thing going on and Then you don't translate it in a way.

440
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:29,673
Speaker 0: not it's not.

441
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:31,440
Speaker 0: I'm not saying like inaccurate, right?

442
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,061
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

443
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:33,968
Speaker 0: but it's like in a way that means nothing.

444
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:34,830
Speaker 0: It's just like words.

445
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:37,138
Speaker 0: you you're not following anything.

446
00:26:37,158 --> 00:26:37,780
Speaker 0: that's happening.

447
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,182
Speaker 0: Yeah Doesn't really work.

448
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:47,788
Speaker 1: like Star Trek which was often guilty of that would basically use all those words in a context to convey something To solve a problem and then move past it.

449
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:50,159
Speaker 1: the show wasn't about those nonsense words.

450
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,245
Speaker 0: Yep And then yeah, there's.

451
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:54,650
Speaker 0: no I was also disappointed.

452
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,040
Speaker 0: There was no payoff of monsters fighting each other.

453
00:26:58,623 --> 00:27:00,638
Speaker 0: But at the end of the show, you know, there's.

454
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:03,670
Speaker 0: you know There's always that post-credits deal right and it's like they make.

455
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:10,451
Speaker 0: if they make more of this which I think they might they may Said they were going to already that might have monster on monster battling.

456
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:11,454
Speaker 0: So that might be worth.

457
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:13,540
Speaker 1: I'll say you're into the monster on monster.

458
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:24,539
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, yeah If it rains enough, I feel like I could watch this.

459
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:34,589
Speaker 0: Yeah I think if you're uh, I think this is only for people who are like if you're a real like Godzilla type fan right then this is for you.

460
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:41,898
Speaker 0: if you're just like you like a Godzilla now and then you know it's only if The hurricane is over your house.

461
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:47,711
Speaker 1: So similarly I'll geek bite something just really briefly cuz I know I'd like.

462
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:52,358
Speaker 1: I'm really big into like to get birdie and the owl house and All these other shows that Scott hasn't watched yet.

463
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:56,860
Speaker 1: But the owl house is such a phenomenal show like as a kid's show.

464
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,220
Speaker 1: It's great, but it's also like there's a lot going on.

465
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,059
Speaker 1: I've talked about it before.

466
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:18,140
Speaker 1: Season 2 is coming out bit by bit and I've seen enough of season 2 to be able to say season 2 of the owl house just as good continuing on the same plot the back story of the world everything continues to be intriguing and I think it's gonna continue to be a. the dark undertones are legitimate.

467
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,992
Speaker 1: This show is weird and dark and has a lot of sci-fi elements.

468
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,117
Speaker 1: There's fun stuff going on.

469
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:30,860
Speaker 1: So if you haven't watched the owl house watch it season 1 ends in a pretty good spot and You don't have like season.

470
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:34,415
Speaker 1: You could stop and wait for season 2 to finish before you started it.

471
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:42,342
Speaker 1: in case there's more cliffhangers season 1 will end at a point that you would be comfortable with waiting on and season 2 so far is Great.

472
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:46,635
Speaker 0: So I want to introduce a new segment to geek nights which you haven't done in.

473
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:48,179
Speaker 0: I don't know a hundred years.

474
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:55,126
Speaker 0: This is breaking news yeah, so I'm Temporarily which means permanently.

475
00:28:55,187 --> 00:28:58,340
Speaker 0: I've decided to call the segment second dibs, right?

476
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:03,017
Speaker 0: The idea is that I've got some stuff and it's not.

477
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:06,980
Speaker 0: it's stuff That's still good and I don't want to throw it out in the garbage, right?

478
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:15,619
Speaker 0: But I've already given first dibs to people I actually know like actual friends family close people right and they didn't want it.

479
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:19,640
Speaker 0: So the second dibs are is for the listener, right?

480
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,733
Speaker 0: We're gonna see if the listener wants something that I have that I don't want anymore.

481
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:39,200
Speaker 0: and if the listener doesn't want it Then you know, sometimes it might be something free sometimes it might be just pay shipping sometimes it's gonna cost money Right, but if none of the listeners want it then third dibs is gonna go to eBay Facebook marketplace some shit like that, right?

482
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:49,700
Speaker 0: So what I have for you is the first item up for dibs And if you want the item just contact us via any of the contact mechanisms that we have.

483
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:57,432
Speaker 0: There are many pick one our discord Our forum an email Twitter DM whatever.

484
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:03,908
Speaker 0: so I recently replaced My second monitor, right?

485
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:13,880
Speaker 0: So now I've got two daddy to 4k monitors now, so One of the monitors that I had the two monitors one of them broke and it temporarily swapped it with an identical one.

486
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:14,377
Speaker 0: That was rims.

487
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:23,880
Speaker 1: I gave rims back when I got my first 4k monitor which is good timing because my Backup monitor that I was using in the kitchen finally died and now I put this one in the kitchen spot.

488
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,940
Speaker 0: So my second non 4k monitor just got replaced, but it still works.

489
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,692
Speaker 0: It is a Dell u24 10 ultra sharp monitor.

490
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:37,319
Speaker 0: It is 1600 by 1200 resolution 16 by 10 aspect ratio.

491
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,788
Speaker 0: Really good, you know color accuracy.

492
00:30:40,868 --> 00:30:43,376
Speaker 0: considering it's an LCD monitor.

493
00:30:43,396 --> 00:30:50,990
Speaker 0: It has a absolutely ridiculous number of inputs HDMI displayport DVI VGA and component.

494
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,941
Speaker 0: you can plug a frickin we into this with like a component cable if you want to Right.

495
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,950
Speaker 0: It's really useful to have all those inputs.

496
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:57,532
Speaker 0: I'm kind of sad.

497
00:30:57,573 --> 00:31:01,821
Speaker 0: my new monitor doesn't have those You.

498
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,446
Speaker 0: it's totally works.

499
00:31:03,848 --> 00:31:09,885
Speaker 0: it doesn't have a stand because the original stand I got rid of but It's basically my mom.

500
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:10,327
Speaker 1: It's basic.

501
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,351
Speaker 0: I put my.

502
00:31:11,392 --> 00:31:13,279
Speaker 0: I put my monitors on arms.

503
00:31:14,102 --> 00:31:15,827
Speaker 0: So my new monitor.

504
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:18,494
Speaker 0: I came with a stand that I'm not using.

505
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:20,640
Speaker 0: so it's on a stand.

506
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,727
Speaker 0: It's just not the stand it was supposed to go with.

507
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:26,380
Speaker 0: it's on a stand from a much newer brand new Dell monitor.

508
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:28,040
Speaker 0: So arguably it's a monitor.

509
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:34,080
Speaker 0: It's an old Dell monitor on a stand that's designed for a newer 4k Dell monitor.

510
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:37,869
Speaker 0: So it looks a little weird from the back, but it totally works.

511
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:41,839
Speaker 0: So it's honest and it's just not dust and it's supposed to have.

512
00:31:42,663 --> 00:31:45,274
Speaker 0: Not bad I can give you with this.

513
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:49,912
Speaker 0: Oh, it has a USB hub built in And I can give you with this monitor.

514
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,140
Speaker 0: I can give you a power cable.

515
00:31:51,722 --> 00:31:56,580
Speaker 0: I can give you the USB cable so that you can plug it into your computer and then it will act as USB hub.

516
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:06,640
Speaker 0: Right and I can give you a display port cable that is guaranteed to have all the pins so that it's not going to fry Your computer meaning it's missing the pin that will fry your computer.

517
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:13,086
Speaker 0: Yes, I can give you a guaranteed correctly working safe Functioning DisplayPort cable.

518
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:15,980
Speaker 0: I can even give an HDMI cable if you tell me you need one.

519
00:32:16,362 --> 00:32:18,940
Speaker 0: I can give you a VGI and a DVI cable if you ask for one, too.

520
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,451
Speaker 1: I mean if you want old cables for video stuff We could hook you up right.

521
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:27,659
Speaker 0: if there's a I mean by default I'm gonna give you the cables I said.

522
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,300
Speaker 0: But if you if you need one of those other cables I can I can give it to you.

523
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:32,920
Speaker 1: Oh doesn't also have a built-in card reader.

524
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:34,464
Speaker 0: It does.

525
00:32:34,504 --> 00:32:37,460
Speaker 0: yeah built part of the USB hub is an SD card reader.

526
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,034
Speaker 0: It's USB 2 mind you.

527
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:48,369
Speaker 0: but yeah It is a. there is a built-in SD card reader on the side next to the USB hub ports And also it because it has all those inputs.

528
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:54,950
Speaker 0: It does picture-in-picture, so if you plug in like several devices Oh shit, I forgot all those old ultra sharps had that.

529
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:00,166
Speaker 1: I don't think the new ones had that I think the new one might Ever play less inputs.

530
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:04,200
Speaker 0: I've never knew it has made less input, so it's not really there's no point to it, right.

531
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:18,600
Speaker 0: But yeah, you could plug in for example a Wii on the component inputs, and I don't know Your laptop on the DisplayPort input, and then you could have like the Wii game in a little box in the corner.

532
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,876
Speaker 0: You could even move it around or like you know whatever and then have your computer like you can do.

533
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:27,390
Speaker 0: all kinds of picture-in-picture layouts With mixing the inputs together, it's pretty.

534
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,600
Speaker 0: it's pretty cool even though it's an old monitor.

535
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:39,360
Speaker 0: so I bought this monitor for like five hundred dollars way a long time ago that and I just replaced it with a 500 ish dollar monitor.

536
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:44,586
Speaker 0: but it's so old and also the monitors have one problem and That it is sort of yellowed.

537
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:49,024
Speaker 0: if you look at the monitor from like a distance at the wrong angle You can see this sort of like.

538
00:33:49,466 --> 00:33:55,159
Speaker 0: it looks like there's a yellow blob around the edges of the screen and like only the center Of the screen looks like it's the right color.

539
00:33:55,722 --> 00:33:59,476
Speaker 0: But if you're sitting close to the monitor just using it like you can't notice at all.

540
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:00,500
Speaker 0: it looks perfectly normal.

541
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:02,560
Speaker 0: So there's some sort of yellowing.

542
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:13,580
Speaker 0: I think what's happened is that UV light like does these reflectors, but inside the monitor behind the backlights There's like white reflectors that reflect the backlight back at the screen.

543
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:17,800
Speaker 0: Right because there's no point in having the backlight shoot light out the back of the monitor.

544
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,443
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

545
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:21,500
Speaker 0: It just makes the screen brighter to put reflectors behind the backlights.

546
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:29,652
Speaker 0: I think those reflectors Supposedly have yellowed from UV light over the years make sense.

547
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:33,255
Speaker 0: monitors from like who knows when 2014 Maybe it's really old.

548
00:34:34,524 --> 00:34:38,060
Speaker 0: So that might be the problem, but it doesn't affect the functioning of the monitor.

549
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:50,580
Speaker 0: So if you want this monitor, and it's not gonna be free, but it's gonna be pretty cheap right like hundred bucks you think Oh For like it makes God an offer.

550
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:54,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like it was a top-of-the-line monitor right like amazing.

551
00:34:54,681 --> 00:35:00,163
Speaker 0: It's just way old and has some yellowing going on and I want to recoup some of the cost of this new Monitor.

552
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:01,670
Speaker 0: that will hopefully last just as long.

553
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:06,356
Speaker 0: so if you need a monitor computer monitor, that's kind of awesome.

554
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,865
Speaker 0: actually Let me know.

555
00:35:08,885 --> 00:35:14,180
Speaker 0: yep, and the other rule we have otherwise I'm gonna by the by the next time we do a show or whatever.

556
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:16,178
Speaker 0: It's just gonna be on eBay if no one wants it.

557
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:20,260
Speaker 1: yep And the other rule we have with this bit is if one of us does it the other one can't do it.

558
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,877
Speaker 1: So I can't try to voice this recalled fire extinguisher on you.

559
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:25,303
Speaker 0: No, you'll do that.

560
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:25,705
Speaker 0: We're gonna.

561
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:29,040
Speaker 0: You know we're not gonna do too many at once because otherwise we'll run out of bits, right?

562
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,019
Speaker 0: We'll get well all the shit in our house will be gone.

563
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:39,317
Speaker 1: Or geek nights gets weird, and there's like the arrow where we were just doing basic nights home shopping club basically geek nights GVC.

564
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,287
Speaker 1: I Feel like next day for the next one.

565
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,113
Speaker 1: you got to try to talk in that kind of tone.

566
00:35:44,173 --> 00:35:44,334
Speaker 1: like.

567
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:46,700
Speaker 1: this monitor features an array of functions.

568
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:54,023
Speaker 0: It just most of them will be much shorter than this one, but just the monitor has had so many features I think like the.

569
00:35:54,405 --> 00:36:01,590
Speaker 0: the next thing I'm gonna try to get rid of has you know way fewer features, so So in the mood.

570
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:12,769
Speaker 1: actually it's time for things Of the day so check this.

571
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,937
Speaker 1: this was uploaded on June 27th.

572
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,904
Speaker 1: This was a recent video.

573
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:19,110
Speaker 1: I just found it kind of randomly.

574
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,434
Speaker 1: I wasn't even subscribed to this account.

575
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:28,825
Speaker 1: It's a an animation kind of in the Yamashibai style Style and it's basic.

576
00:36:28,845 --> 00:36:33,055
Speaker 1: It's called yokai Bob the Builder, and it is.

577
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:42,077
Speaker 0: it is a like legitimately scary four-minute long show Where in the title tells you everything you need to know.

Speaker 1: But yeah, when you see this you'll see what I mean.

592
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:20,980
Speaker 1: like they got the style right.

593
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,804
Speaker 1: It's clearly.

594
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:22,045
Speaker 1: it's like.

595
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:23,754
Speaker 1: it's not anime like it's.

596
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:30,660
Speaker 1: it feels like someone Made something that wanted to feel like anime, but wasn't quite deep enough in anime to get it perfect.

597
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:35,189
Speaker 1: But the yokai part is like spot-on yokai.

598
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:38,771
Speaker 0: Elmo My co-worker took their kid to sesame place.

599
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:40,158
Speaker 0: Oh, we're talking about that.

600
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:43,058
Speaker 0: yeah So what do you got thing of the day?

601
00:37:43,701 --> 00:37:45,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the hockey's going on right now.

602
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:49,428
Speaker 0: the Stanley Cup could come out as soon as tonight Maybe before you even heard this episode.

603
00:37:49,448 --> 00:37:52,240
Speaker 0: it may have come out already because the lightning up three games to one.

604
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,829
Speaker 1: I hope it doesn't cuz I'm not a particular fan of the Habs But I'd rather anyone of a Tampa win.

605
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:59,682
Speaker 0: so as long as I was lost I don't care.

606
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:03,580
Speaker 1: you know my dad was like hey like before like the allergies were eliminated.

607
00:38:03,922 --> 00:38:06,074
Speaker 1: Hey, well on New York teams gonna make it to the end right.

608
00:38:06,114 --> 00:38:06,819
Speaker 1: so that's something.

609
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:07,582
Speaker 0: yeah No, that's.

610
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,772
Speaker 0: that's if a New York team is gonna win.

611
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:11,500
Speaker 0: That's either the best thing or the worst.

612
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:13,881
Speaker 0: It's not like okay It's.

613
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:17,840
Speaker 1: I've realized that only New Yorkers are that weird about it because there's so many teams.

614
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,744
Speaker 1: There's such a dense area.

615
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:21,619
Speaker 0: You think people you think Cubs fans are happy at the White Sox win.

616
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:24,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that's the other bar.

617
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,263
Speaker 1: That's one.

618
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:27,531
Speaker 0: Dodgers fans are happy if like the Angels win.

619
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:28,274
Speaker 0: it might be even though.

620
00:38:28,294 --> 00:38:29,920
Speaker 0: It's Anaheim and not LA or whatever.

621
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:30,385
Speaker 0: I don't know.

622
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:36,920
Speaker 0: yeah, I Don't I don't I feel like no right People who got two teams only like one of the two teams.

623
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,340
Speaker 1: I mean honestly I couldn't care less if the Mets or the Yankees win the World Series.

624
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,779
Speaker 0: Anyway.

625
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:51,380
Speaker 0: So yeah, so the one game that the Habs have won so far was game four and there was his dude.

626
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:52,400
Speaker 0: I don't know his name.

627
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,631
Speaker 0: I think he's like works like SB nation or does he does like?

628
00:38:55,651 --> 00:38:58,260
Speaker 0: he's like a. he's like a sports media person for the Habs.

629
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:58,581
Speaker 0: He's not.

630
00:38:58,602 --> 00:38:59,486
Speaker 0: he's not just some fan.

631
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:14,820
Speaker 0: Okay, so that's why he was being interviewed on TV Outside the arena right during the overtime of game four By the sports television people and so they're asking questions like you know how do you think the game's gonna turn out?

632
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,945
Speaker 0: You know it's so he.

633
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:17,977
Speaker 0: you know he predicts the finish of the game.

634
00:39:17,997 --> 00:39:18,298
Speaker 0: He's like.

635
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:19,243
Speaker 0: yeah He's like.

636
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:20,188
Speaker 0: I think we're gonna score.

637
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,600
Speaker 0: You know if we if we win this one right I think he's like we're gonna score a goal here in the overtime.

638
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:31,659
Speaker 0: It'll be the be the Habs and he thinks Anderson's gonna score the goal During the inner during the interview.

639
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:37,980
Speaker 0: While he's still there Anderson scores the goal to win the game in overtime, right?

640
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:45,391
Speaker 0: So this is like this is pretty awesome video here And honestly like it doesn't it doesn't spoil the video.

641
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:47,440
Speaker 0: It's for me to tell you what happens in the video.

642
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:48,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I won't link to it.

643
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,652
Speaker 1: but if you know what the blab is they're showing the game.

644
00:39:51,672 --> 00:40:00,919
Speaker 1: if you don't have any other way to see hockey and Basically if you never watched ice hockey the games that are happening now are kind of the peak of the sport.

645
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:05,218
Speaker 1: Things get different during the Stanley Cup playoffs compared to all they just get.

646
00:40:05,258 --> 00:40:07,694
Speaker 0: did it Yeah in the playoffs and so this is the finals.

647
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:08,700
Speaker 0: so they're even more different.

648
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:13,491
Speaker 0: But yeah hockey players You know they play a long season of hockey which you you normally for.

649
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,380
Speaker 0: like football you such a brutal sport you play less games.

650
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,900
Speaker 0: Right hockey plays a lot a lot of games for something that you know probably should be less games like sometimes.

651
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:24,666
Speaker 0: I took a survey today.

652
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:27,352
Speaker 0: That was like how many games should the season be?

653
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:30,700
Speaker 0: and I chose like half as many right?

654
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:34,715
Speaker 1: It should be way back in same number of day games.

655
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:35,680
Speaker 1: We have tickets to maybe.

656
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:37,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like man.

657
00:40:37,649 --> 00:40:38,900
Speaker 0: I was like you should cut it way back.

658
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:45,505
Speaker 0: I don't think that was a popular choice, but that's what I chose now, but regardless hockey players Don't play.

659
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:48,639
Speaker 0: you know they play seriously, and they play hard in the regular season.

660
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:54,600
Speaker 0: sometimes They do play their hardest in regular season games that mean a lot, but playoff hockey is completely different.

661
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,447
Speaker 0: It's like if you go to the Madison Square Garden to see a playoff hockey game You'd think it was a different building.

662
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:07,080
Speaker 1: yeah when you went to see a regular season like a few times I have been in person at a Stanley Cup playoff game like especially past the first round.

663
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:17,650
Speaker 1: It's weird to be in a building that you've been to so many times with the same size crowd and somehow it is three times Louder at all times, and it's just the.

664
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:19,155
Speaker 0: everything is different right now.

665
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:20,620
Speaker 0: It's the same building right.

666
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,061
Speaker 0: say It's like.

667
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:22,246
Speaker 0: it's like what the heck.

668
00:41:22,306 --> 00:41:25,940
Speaker 0: It's like you're playing the same hockey by the same rules almost the same rules.

669
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,404
Speaker 0: Overtime is different.

670
00:41:27,424 --> 00:41:31,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, the old the big difference for those you're on hockey people is in normal hockey and most sports.

671
00:41:31,642 --> 00:41:33,596
Speaker 1: There's a point where the game will like okay.

672
00:41:33,636 --> 00:41:34,220
Speaker 1: It's overtime.

673
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,103
Speaker 1: We're gonna do some bullshitty thing just to end the game or we'll do something quick Or it'll just be a tie.

674
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:42,152
Speaker 1: some sports just allow ties in playoff NHL hockey.

675
00:41:42,272 --> 00:41:45,200
Speaker 1: nope just keep fucking playing normal hockey until someone wins.

676
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,044
Speaker 1: We'll go all day.

677
00:41:46,244 --> 00:41:46,907
Speaker 1: We'll go forever.

678
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:49,900
Speaker 1: the rules literally are go forever.

679
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:59,375
Speaker 0: So I think if you're going to be a new hockey fan Or you're going to try to get someone to be a new hockey fan Playout postseason hockey is I think ideal.

680
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:05,454
Speaker 0: to show people first Yeah, you know it's sort of bad because when they watch a regular season hockey the next year They'd be like

681
00:42:05,475 --> 00:42:08,007
Speaker 1: hey You know what it's like when the anime club

682
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:09,812
Speaker 0: riding the roller coaster first

683
00:42:09,852 --> 00:42:17,297
Speaker 1: the anime club showed episode 5 of cowboy bebop But you know the spike just to be like hey check out how fucking awesome anime is.

684
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:17,819
Speaker 1: everyone's like woo.

685
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,578
Speaker 1: And then not all anime is like that.

686
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:33,105
Speaker 1: People see Cagliostro and like who gonna watch way more Lupin, and then they watch like All.

687
00:42:33,145 --> 00:42:34,394
Speaker 1: right, let's bet a moment.

688
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:35,360
Speaker 1: We're reading the tale of Genji.

689
00:42:35,501 --> 00:42:36,466
Speaker 1: I'm continuing to read it.

690
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:38,898
Speaker 1: Genji continues to be the exact same kind of person.

691
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,113
Speaker 1: I feel like there is not growth or change.

692
00:42:42,174 --> 00:42:52,260
Speaker 0: It's the first novel ever and Let's get into our taxi cuz our taxi is yeah, so phenomenal I'd take yeah.

693
00:42:52,382 --> 00:42:53,740
Speaker 0: So there's people on the internet.

694
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:08,398
Speaker 0: We're all ranting and raving about this anime called odd taxi all of every episode of which is on crunchyroll And the final episode actually just came out like a week 29th was the last episode of 13 so a couple weeks ago.

695
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:16,920
Speaker 0: So what happened to me is I finally got around to watching it when there were every episode except the final one was out.

696
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:18,548
Speaker 0: I watched it on like there was a.

697
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:20,156
Speaker 1: there was a strong pressure.

698
00:43:20,236 --> 00:43:28,020
Speaker 1: No one was telling me Oh, you gotta watch odd taxi, but the people I know who are deep into anime and the anime industry people and Anna Twitter.

699
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:34,920
Speaker 1: Everyone was talking about this show, but also avoiding talking about it in any amount of detail.

700
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:39,800
Speaker 0: Yep, so I watched all the episodes except for the final one because it wasn't out yet.

701
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,494
Speaker 0: And then I watched the final one the day it came out and that was it.

702
00:43:42,634 --> 00:43:43,660
Speaker 0: and now we can do a show on it.

703
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen about a little over half of it, and we're gonna finish it pretty quick because it's so good.

704
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:54,529
Speaker 1: But what that means is I can speculate a little bit without spoiling Just based on what I've seen but the

705
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:55,351
Speaker 0: show

706
00:43:55,371 --> 00:44:17,260
Speaker 1: if I had to just describe it on a really high level it's a psychological thriller where there's a core mystery but a bunch of other stuff is happening like in the orbit of this mystery and There's a lot of very dark and sinister Undertones constantly in a show that on the surface is a bunch of cute animals interacting with this taxi driver.

707
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:29,980
Speaker 0: Yes, so you know in snatch right you have all these different care whole cast of characters all doing different stuff But they're all sort of tied together right by the diamonds right and sort of linking their different stories.

708
00:44:30,463 --> 00:44:35,465
Speaker 0: And there's the scene where they all literally crash into each other At the climax.

709
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:39,098
Speaker 0: so odd taxi is similar, but not so right.

710
00:44:39,198 --> 00:44:39,720
Speaker 0: it's similar.

711
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,253
Speaker 0: And there's a cast of characters who all have their own stories that you all care about.

712
00:44:43,273 --> 00:44:44,056
Speaker 0: individually right.

713
00:44:44,076 --> 00:44:50,100
Speaker 0: all these separate arcs Right but at no point do all the characters crash into each other.

714
00:44:50,803 --> 00:44:55,083
Speaker 0: It's that all the characters are linked to Right.

715
00:44:55,525 --> 00:45:02,059
Speaker 0: okamura is his name right a taxi driver Otakawa the taxi driver, it's like you know what it's more like in that regard.

716
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:13,620
Speaker 1: Durara has all these different characters with their crazy deals But they're all tied together by like the mid not like the mythological events that are happening in that neighborhood in ikebukuro.

717
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:18,759
Speaker 1: Yep sure exactly reminds you of that show a lot in terms of that aspect of it.

718
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:31,020
Speaker 1: But instead of being and it's a crazy anime bullshit It's more like there's a paranoid agent weird thing going on that the show is like skirting the edges of something dark and sinister and foreboding.

719
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,940
Speaker 0: Yep, so you have this taxi driver.

720
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:40,409
Speaker 0: He's just a taxi driver And you know he's mostly always just drives like super safe And he's sort of quiet and weird with people.

721
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:45,152
Speaker 0: right you can tell he says like some discomfort like being with people Talking to people normally.

722
00:45:45,172 --> 00:45:47,724
Speaker 0: He'll be like Sarcastic or whatever right?

723
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:54,100
Speaker 0: and there's all these other characters who have their own plot lines that you know sometimes touch each other.

724
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,123
Speaker 0: Sometimes don't.

725
00:45:55,164 --> 00:45:57,030
Speaker 0: some characters don't know each other at all.

726
00:45:57,431 --> 00:45:59,558
Speaker 0: You know some characters are very close to each other.

727
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:00,321
Speaker 0: right there part like.

728
00:46:00,362 --> 00:46:07,631
Speaker 1: there's a gorilla who is like a psycho a psycho like a Psychiatrist who also is like the Otakawa.

729
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:09,476
Speaker 1: the taxi driver goes to his clinic.

730
00:46:09,696 --> 00:46:10,779
Speaker 1: There's a nurse that he knows.

731
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:18,480
Speaker 1: there There's this other monkey guy who Not a spoiler easily gets scammed by a very obvious scam that happens in the real world.

732
00:46:18,982 --> 00:46:23,360
Speaker 1: There's two brothers who are cops and one of them seems like he's corrupt and the other one seems like he's stupid.

733
00:46:24,304 --> 00:46:27,899
Speaker 0: Right so right, so there's like Otakawa The Monzai duo I love the most.

734
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:30,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, Monzai duo is great right so it's pretty right.

735
00:46:30,448 --> 00:46:34,260
Speaker 0: so you know Otakawa is connected to the gorilla.

736
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,437
Speaker 0: He's his patient right and the nurse there right, but what does the nurse have to do with the cops?

737
00:46:39,498 --> 00:46:40,120
Speaker 0: like not much?

738
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,612
Speaker 0: But Otakawa is connected to the cops right he like.

739
00:46:43,632 --> 00:46:44,556
Speaker 0: he knows them like he'd.

740
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:45,400
Speaker 0: you know he sees them.

741
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,359
Speaker 0: They pull him over sometimes.

742
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,791
Speaker 1: That was something that stood out to me even in the very beginning.

743
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:50,700
Speaker 1: is that it starts out like he's just a taxi driver.

744
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:56,499
Speaker 1: but as the show goes on it seems like these characters have interacted with him before and know a lot about him.

745
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:59,019
Speaker 1: and There's all these moments where he?

746
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,160
Speaker 1: Reveals that he knows a lot more than you would expect him to about some random thing.

747
00:47:06,342 --> 00:47:07,426
Speaker 0: He knows a lot he's.

748
00:47:07,506 --> 00:47:12,120
Speaker 0: all these people are in his taxi spilling the beans and all kinds of stuff thinking He's just a taxi driver.

749
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:24,719
Speaker 1: There's like this whole plot where all these different people keep coming up to him and like they want his Video from the dashcam like right, so that's that's the central mystery at the start of the show right?

750
00:47:24,859 --> 00:47:25,180
Speaker 0: is that?

751
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:32,340
Speaker 0: Supposedly there was some Yakuza boss right a Yakuza boss's daughter who is missing.

752
00:47:33,703 --> 00:47:37,367
Speaker 0: And or you know that no one knows right miss It's like it's the talk of the town.

753
00:47:37,407 --> 00:47:39,840
Speaker 1: like that's the news recently that this girl is right.

754
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,021
Speaker 1: It's it.

755
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:56,083
Speaker 0: and the cops were looking for them But then stopped looking and then it did strongly implied but never shown that the the the Yakuza boss daughter took a ride in this taxi and Basically without.

756
00:47:56,144 --> 00:47:59,393
Speaker 0: they don't say anything right, but there's he's.

757
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:03,045
Speaker 0: they imply that a that She was in the taxi.

758
00:48:03,085 --> 00:48:04,592
Speaker 0: you never see that she was in the taxi.

759
00:48:04,612 --> 00:48:05,356
Speaker 0: They never show that.

760
00:48:05,376 --> 00:48:07,773
Speaker 0: yeah, right This is dashcam footage.

761
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:20,989
Speaker 0: so people yeah He has video of everything that's happened in the taxi and people are fight trying to get him You know to give them the footage right and he you know stuff happens there That but you don't see.

762
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:22,497
Speaker 0: you never shown the footage right.

763
00:48:22,517 --> 00:48:24,365
Speaker 0: you have no idea What would happened.

764
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:28,380
Speaker 0: and also see he's talking to someone in his apartment?

765
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:29,784
Speaker 0: Who's in the closet?

766
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:38,231
Speaker 0: literally the physical closet not metaphorical closet, and they don't talk back to him So you don't know what the fuck is in his closet.

767
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:38,592
Speaker 0: Is it?

768
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:39,516
Speaker 0: is it the girl?

769
00:48:39,596 --> 00:48:39,958
Speaker 0: is it what?

770
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:40,319
Speaker 0: so yeah?

771
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,033
Speaker 1: It's nothing is like he like having see.

772
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:47,353
Speaker 1: like if you watch a little bit of the show There is no one in the closet is a viable theory.

773
00:48:47,373 --> 00:48:48,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, is he just talking to himself?

774
00:48:49,040 --> 00:49:04,451
Speaker 0: It's like you have no ideas, but there's this strong implication that he may have right Kidnapped or not maybe not kidnapped, but maybe she intentionally like you know befriended him And it's like he's hiding her because that's what she wants.

775
00:49:04,471 --> 00:49:19,019
Speaker 0: That's heavily implied But no one knows and that's that's sort of like the this beginning spark mystery that sort of spirals and connects All the other people and their mysteries and their deals.

776
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:32,451
Speaker 1: yeah And throughout the rest of the show at least for the first full half of the show The implications around most of these characters get more and more sinister But they never quite full-on reveal a lot of things.

777
00:49:32,772 --> 00:49:39,940
Speaker 1: so the show ends up feeling like a really tight Psychological thriller where the tensions just slowly building episode by episode.

778
00:49:40,523 --> 00:49:43,296
Speaker 0: It's you know those things the story stereotypical thing.

779
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:51,040
Speaker 0: we're like the crazy Detective or person has like a wall with a bunch of photos and streams on nails connecting them and all that stuff, right?

780
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:52,686
Speaker 0: So imagine one of those.

781
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:56,160
Speaker 0: only as you go it actually makes sense.

782
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,000
Speaker 0: It's like whoever made this show whoever wrote this story did that and it actually connects.

783
00:50:01,361 --> 00:50:07,260
Speaker 0: And it's like it was just like a genius piece of writing to make all those things actually work and connect to each other.

784
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,885
Speaker 0: It's like oh, no, it's actually.

785
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:13,380
Speaker 0: it's not just some you know rantings of a you know a madman or whatever.

786
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:17,536
Speaker 0: It's it's actually yeah, you know yeah, we made this thing happen.

787
00:50:17,576 --> 00:50:18,700
Speaker 0: look watch it unfold.

788
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:25,260
Speaker 0: I think what I like most selectively give you and don't give you the audience information at various points in time.

789
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:31,147
Speaker 1: what I like the most is that the dialogue between the characters is Very like it is.

790
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:33,160
Speaker 1: it's hard to describe exactly what I mean by this.

791
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:47,740
Speaker 1: it is very precise and it reveals exactly what the show wants you to know and characters will say things that Imply a lot of other things that will cause you to speculate about the motivations of other characters.

792
00:50:48,063 --> 00:50:50,080
Speaker 1: I'm being vague on purpose because it shows a mystery.

793
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:53,308
Speaker 0: Also, they also people talk to each other.

794
00:50:53,348 --> 00:51:03,899
Speaker 0: the way I think at least according to the subtitles the way people talk to each other Right it's like but like little subtle like the tax driver seems kind of unaware like a taxi driver sometimes But when he's talking to some people.

795
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:07,570
Speaker 1: He'll just say something that makes it very clear.

796
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:10,960
Speaker 1: He knows way more about what's going on than he's letting on.

797
00:51:12,481 --> 00:51:13,706
Speaker 1: But then in other situations.

798
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:17,500
Speaker 1: He is like very clearly surprised by what someone else said to him.

799
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:21,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the the different sort of groupings of the plot right is.

800
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:23,160
Speaker 0: there's the gorilla nurse guy.

801
00:51:23,521 --> 00:51:26,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's the social media guy hippo.

802
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:35,260
Speaker 1: There's though at the mandrill dobu the the criminal I'm making quote fingers Who's on the loose that the whole town is like after for various?

803
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's like.

804
00:51:36,122 --> 00:51:41,260
Speaker 1: he's like a little town is Tokyo, but that live streamer guys like I'm gonna get you you criminal.

805
00:51:42,023 --> 00:51:43,629
Speaker 0: Yes, he's an actual gangster.

806
00:51:43,669 --> 00:51:48,220
Speaker 0: that guy yeah like actually doing crimes But he has other motivations.

807
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:53,590
Speaker 0: Then you've got though that's the idol group right.

808
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:55,516
Speaker 0: and then there's the monzai group.

809
00:51:56,198 --> 00:51:56,859
Speaker 0: is that all of them?

810
00:51:58,523 --> 00:51:59,494
Speaker 0: That's most of it right?

811
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:09,179
Speaker 1: yeah I mean the idol group has like the three members we know about plus the manager guy who's clearly up to something and that other Guy in the background is clearly in on it.

812
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:10,003
Speaker 0: So there's these.

813
00:52:10,084 --> 00:52:12,414
Speaker 0: there's these sort of connections between the groups right.

814
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:17,620
Speaker 0: it's like there's a connection between One of them people in the monzai group and one of the idols in the idol group.

815
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:32,420
Speaker 0: there's a connection between the criminal guy and The not the gorilla, but the the nurse who's a alpaca llama But she's not back up, but everyone else all has a red line back to Oda Kawa.

816
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:36,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, every single person's going back to Oda Kawa right?

817
00:52:36,094 --> 00:52:39,727
Speaker 0: they've either been in his taxi Or he's involved with them directly in some way.

818
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:47,691
Speaker 0: right he listens to the monzai group and the monzai guy was in his taxi once right You know there's a. there's a giraffe kid.

819
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,560
Speaker 0: Who's a fan of the monzai group right?

820
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,918
Speaker 0: He's barely in the show, but I know she was in the show more.

821
00:52:53,101 --> 00:52:56,190
Speaker 0: But yeah the show basically just unfolds this mystery.

822
00:52:56,692 --> 00:52:56,992
Speaker 0: right.

823
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:05,244
Speaker 0: and then in the final three episodes Right the second to last and third to last episodes are The odd taxi.

824
00:53:05,445 --> 00:53:08,935
Speaker 0: like there's actually a thing the odd taxi that happens right.

825
00:53:08,955 --> 00:53:10,139
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say any more about that.

826
00:53:11,485 --> 00:53:19,220
Speaker 0: It's the one during Yeah during the course of the odd taxi much is revealed and then in the final episode.

827
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:32,453
Speaker 0: Right the final episode on the one hand is like a great ending and on the other hand could be viewed as Disappointing in the depending on your perspective because what they do in the final episode is it.

828
00:53:33,114 --> 00:53:35,580
Speaker 0: it's almost like an epilogue.

829
00:53:36,262 --> 00:53:36,382
Speaker 0: It's.

830
00:53:36,744 --> 00:53:41,720
Speaker 0: it's plays like an epilogue right, but it's actually like.

831
00:53:42,423 --> 00:53:45,300
Speaker 0: You know usually an epilogue is like years after the ending.

832
00:53:45,662 --> 00:53:48,580
Speaker 0: This is like no the ending, but it plays like an epilogue.

833
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,403
Speaker 0: They literally go.

834
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:55,060
Speaker 0: it's like someone went down a checklist of every loose end right and was like all right.

835
00:53:55,101 --> 00:54:04,200
Speaker 0: we'll do this one and And it's like litter every single one in the last episode every loose end every question you had.

836
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:05,927
Speaker 0: They just go one by one.

837
00:54:05,947 --> 00:54:15,980
Speaker 0: they're like and this is what happened to this and this is what the deal was with that And this is what that was about and this explains that and so and so and so all in that one final episode.

838
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:20,272
Speaker 0: So that is in some ways really satisfying because who the fuck does that?

839
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:21,597
Speaker 0: there's usually some hanging shit.

840
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:28,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, right But they left nothing Unknown other than the future of course, but yeah, you know that's always unknown.

841
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:29,884
Speaker 1: well That was a spoiler.

842
00:54:29,924 --> 00:54:32,455
Speaker 1: the world doesn't end as a result of the odd taxi.

843
00:54:32,475 --> 00:54:34,578
Speaker 0: Oh I guess not.

844
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:39,661
Speaker 0: Story about a taxi driver is not an apocalyptic tale the funniest thing We want.

845
00:54:39,681 --> 00:54:47,327
Speaker 1: we watched a couple episodes, and we both had this image of if this were a live-action show like it could work But he's a really great live-action.

846
00:54:47,347 --> 00:54:50,560
Speaker 1: Oh, I imagine Bruce Willis specifically playing Ota Kawa.

847
00:54:51,304 --> 00:54:53,579
Speaker 0: Is that just because he drove a taxi in Fifth Element?

848
00:54:53,619 --> 00:55:12,300
Speaker 1: no But it's it's because of like his attitude and like his dialogue and like I just imagine a sort of slaw Slightly slovenly looking like middle-aged Bruce Willis sitting there having those conversations Because Ota Kawa has these moments where he seems really like schlubby, but then he'll just get this hardness about him out of nowhere

849
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:13,964
Speaker 0: Mmm.

850
00:55:14,045 --> 00:55:18,854
Speaker 1: I'd like that's the kind of thing that Bruce Willis does pretty well And I feel like he would be like that.

851
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:22,880
Speaker 1: that's the kind of actor I would set to play Ota Kawa in the live-action adaptation.

852
00:55:24,142 --> 00:55:29,625
Speaker 0: The only thing I could the only other thing I can say about the show is if you're one of the people Unlike me right.

853
00:55:29,645 --> 00:55:33,659
Speaker 0: if you're unlike me, and you want you value surprise highly, right?

854
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:41,799
Speaker 0: Because you know I'm not spoiling the show just out of courtesy right because obviously I won't do that But you can spoil it for me, but I already seen it all.

855
00:55:43,901 --> 00:55:44,523
Speaker 0: Is that you know?

856
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:47,893
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people avoid spoilers because they want to be surprised.

857
00:55:48,074 --> 00:55:52,051
Speaker 0: the show may surprise you Depending on who you are right.

858
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:57,353
Speaker 0: I don't know about that, but Basically while it was nice to see all those resolutions.

859
00:55:57,513 --> 00:56:04,418
Speaker 1: I was not surprised by anything We've made Emily, and I why as we're watching it have made some specific predictions, and we're very or I.

860
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:13,860
Speaker 0: I don't even know what specific predictions you have made But I will just just knowing the fact that you have made a prediction and that you are an intelligent person who can you know?

861
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,952
Speaker 0: Read subtext, and you know see Chekhov's guns hanging on the wall and things about.

862
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:20,737
Speaker 1: this show is so full.

863
00:56:21,038 --> 00:56:24,156
Speaker 0: the Chekhov's Chekhov's Arsenal.

864
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:32,220
Speaker 0: yeah Just knowing that you are someone who can recognize that I'll bet 80% chance your predictions are probably just dead on right?

865
00:56:32,361 --> 00:56:32,521
Speaker 0: It's.

866
00:56:33,144 --> 00:56:34,991
Speaker 0: it's that kind of show where it's like yep.

867
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:39,024
Speaker 0: It's it is what you thought it was But it doesn't.

868
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:40,550
Speaker 0: it doesn't take away from it right?

869
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:44,364
Speaker 0: it doesn't need surprise because what you thought it was Was was great.

870
00:56:44,785 --> 00:56:47,773
Speaker 1: what I like about it is doesn't need to be surprised just the character.

871
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:57,627
Speaker 1: the tension in almost every Conversation any character has is palpable and that is what drives this show forward More so than the mystery itself.

872
00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:08,280
Speaker 1: and the one thing I get the other thing I can say is in terms of we always talk About the great anime or the one where you end an episode and you are compelled Without even thinking your body just moves on to the next episode.

873
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:12,099
Speaker 1: It was real hard to stop watching this show last night to go to bed.

874
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,909
Speaker 1: Mmm like even the great pretender as much as I liked it.

875
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,154
Speaker 1: I could be like okay.

876
00:57:17,174 --> 00:57:18,820
Speaker 1: That was enough anime for tonight.

877
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:26,352
Speaker 1: But this show was one of those rare shows where if I was in college if we were in college And I'd watch one episode of this.

878
00:57:26,373 --> 00:57:26,554
Speaker 1: well.

879
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:32,224
Speaker 1: It's also so short It's only what twelve thirteen thirteen episodes, but if I'd seen one episode of this in college I would have finished it that night.

880
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,112
Speaker 0: No matter what it's not long.

881
00:57:34,173 --> 00:57:35,217
Speaker 0: You can finish it in six.

882
00:57:35,237 --> 00:57:41,113
Speaker 1: You know six hours I mean we used to like we used to watch In one go basically right.

883
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:43,405
Speaker 0: yeah, it's the last thing I want to say about the show.

884
00:57:43,445 --> 00:57:53,260
Speaker 0: the thing I like about the show the most right is Not even this very well-crafted You know mystery plot with all these characters and all this right, which is all awesome.

885
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:56,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just simply just the atmosphere of the show.

886
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:58,627
Speaker 0: yeah It's like if you're.

887
00:57:58,647 --> 00:58:01,060
Speaker 0: I don't know if you've had this experience.

888
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,472
Speaker 0: You know we have but I don't know if other people listening.

889
00:58:03,532 --> 00:58:04,960
Speaker 0: the listener has right of like.

890
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:12,624
Speaker 0: You're in a hotel in some city, and you wake up early and you go out And it's still dark.

891
00:58:12,986 --> 00:58:15,458
Speaker 0: right and it's quiet and the streets empty.

892
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:18,866
Speaker 0: mostly There's some people around.

893
00:58:18,946 --> 00:58:24,911
Speaker 0: right the con the desk person at the hotel is there right the one guy with the taxi Who's gonna drive it to the airport.

894
00:58:24,951 --> 00:58:26,120
Speaker 0: is they get to the airport?

895
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:35,585
Speaker 1: It's empty But there's the one person there the airport desk to take your man And a lot of the characters are the kinds of people who are up and about during that Liminal hour.

896
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:41,012
Speaker 0: you go you go to the bodega That's open at 1 a.m.. To get something.

897
00:58:41,414 --> 00:58:45,740
Speaker 1: only the bodega guys there on the street And it's the same bodega guy at 1 a.m.. Every day.

898
00:58:45,841 --> 00:58:59,920
Speaker 1: So if you go in at night at that early hour every day Then like it's you to see each other every day that of each other's that real-life Atmosphere of being in a city place that would normally be crowded and busy, but it's dark quiet and empty.

899
00:59:00,363 --> 00:59:02,320
Speaker 0: But you're not completely alone.

900
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:06,147
Speaker 0: There's someone else there But they're not a person you're close to.

901
00:59:06,227 --> 00:59:19,956
Speaker 0: there's some sort of stranger that you're with right at an at a weird hour Possibly a stranger you recognize But don't know and that part is and it's and it's a stranger that you're going to interact with right in some way even if It's just capitalism right?

902
00:59:20,279 --> 00:59:27,110
Speaker 1: well Just like the kinds of conversations on how it has with his passengers like you might as well Just taking that out of someone else's - calf right.

903
00:59:27,471 --> 00:59:34,493
Speaker 0: so that atmosphere that feeling The show doesn't always have that atmosphere at all times right.

904
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:38,439
Speaker 0: there's parts of the show where it's crowded daytime Right oh the things going on.

905
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:48,817
Speaker 0: but a lot of the show especially earlier in the show is just that atmosphere almost all the time because it's about a guy who Drives his taxi, and oh did we mention he doesn't really sleep right.

906
00:59:48,837 --> 00:59:51,098
Speaker 0: so yeah He's out and he's driving it.

907
00:59:51,138 --> 00:59:51,862
Speaker 1: no You know what else?

908
00:59:51,903 --> 00:59:52,465
Speaker 1: it reminds you.

909
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:57,124
Speaker 1: because of his insomnia and because of the not enough again I haven't seen the whole show.

910
00:59:57,546 --> 01:00:03,956
Speaker 1: it is implied that he is mentally unstable And it's also implied by the way seeing a gorilla.

911
01:00:04,036 --> 01:00:05,602
Speaker 0: He's seeing a gorilla You know doc.

912
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:11,859
Speaker 1: yeah, right, but it's implied that the other people around him also pick up on that in the show.

913
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:14,709
Speaker 1: and There's a I don't you ever saw.

914
01:00:14,729 --> 01:00:18,323
Speaker 1: there's a movie the machinists Very similar.

915
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:19,427
Speaker 0: There's a movie called that.

916
01:00:19,587 --> 01:00:20,330
Speaker 1: it's you probably like it.

917
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,754
Speaker 1: It's a psychological thriller.

918
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:22,537
Speaker 1: It's not.

919
01:00:22,657 --> 01:00:23,480
Speaker 1: it's not like this.

920
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:24,603
Speaker 1: There's only one.

921
01:00:24,623 --> 01:00:27,593
Speaker 1: There's a mystery and a thread, but it doesn't.

922
01:00:27,673 --> 01:00:29,720
Speaker 1: it's a very similar atmosphere at times.

923
01:00:30,822 --> 01:00:41,596
Speaker 0: The point is there's something about that atmosphere that I I know for some reason I like it even in real life shared a little spaces like pre-dawn late like that.

924
01:00:41,616 --> 01:00:41,937
Speaker 1: that.

925
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,160
Speaker 0: yeah, right.

926
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:51,024
Speaker 0: So if I experience that in a usually you're experiencing that in a movie or television show right you're not really Experiencing that so much in a book.

927
01:00:51,345 --> 01:01:05,240
Speaker 0: that often right I think you know while you could put it in a book the book doesn't Make you feel the same way because it doesn't have the you know The show portrays and like makes you feel that very very directly and very realistically.

928
01:01:05,782 --> 01:01:09,157
Speaker 0: I felt the exact same feels right that I felt like.

929
01:01:09,278 --> 01:01:09,499
Speaker 0: you know.

930
01:01:10,322 --> 01:01:17,973
Speaker 0: I felt like I was waiting outside in the dark alone trying to get a taxi or Walking on a Manhattan Street to get to the subway alone at night.

931
01:01:18,153 --> 01:01:19,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the stores are closed except for one.

932
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:20,964
Speaker 0: You know this.

933
01:01:21,064 --> 01:01:24,638
Speaker 0: I felt exactly like that when I was watching the show and I like that personally.

934
01:01:24,759 --> 01:01:32,268
Speaker 1: so And yeah, I don't really want to say anything else cuz I'm gonna watch the rest of it like Just wait till it's night and just go walk around.

935
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,195
Speaker 0: Hey, that's kind of why I like.

936
01:01:34,215 --> 01:01:35,559
Speaker 0: the problem is it's really crap.

937
01:01:37,582 --> 01:01:40,900
Speaker 1: Like to get the full night biking experience, I know we want night biking that other time.

938
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:49,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do it in the winner and in yeah But like to get their real night biking experience you got to start later and go further like do it in Manhattan instead of Queens.

939
01:01:49,241 --> 01:01:54,359
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah anyway Yeah I've seen in a while.

940
01:01:55,261 --> 01:01:55,743
Speaker 0: Yeah best.

941
01:01:55,763 --> 01:01:57,733
Speaker 0: I don't know and I don't know if there is based on anything.

942
01:01:57,793 --> 01:01:58,456
Speaker 0: or is it originally?

943
01:01:58,496 --> 01:01:59,240
Speaker 1: it's based on a manga.

944
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:03,645
Speaker 0: Okay, I didn't know those among Let's see.

945
01:02:03,665 --> 01:02:05,260
Speaker 1: It was in superior Del Pana.

946
01:02:06,001 --> 01:02:07,790
Speaker 0: Say no, like I don't need to read the manga.

947
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,218
Speaker 0: after watching the show two volumes.

948
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:11,580
Speaker 1: It says them Oh, wait, is the manga still says the mug is still going?

949
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:14,048
Speaker 0: Whoa, is there more me?

950
01:02:14,129 --> 01:02:14,531
Speaker 0: I don't know.

951
01:02:14,712 --> 01:02:15,940
Speaker 1: Let's see the series aired.

952
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:22,119
Speaker 1: I'm looking to see what the deal is with the manga cuz I always the show the show and oh, no The manga is an adaptation of the anime.

953
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,083
Speaker 0: Okay, we don't need that.

954
01:02:24,123 --> 01:02:29,419
Speaker 1: Yep that I see no reason to read a my adaptation of this considering how good this is.

955
01:02:30,223 --> 01:02:31,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it's you're good.

956
01:02:32,217 --> 01:02:32,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, so.

957
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:35,409
Speaker 0: But if you have I always say this you're gonna.

958
01:02:35,429 --> 01:02:38,260
Speaker 0: if you're gonna live your life and you're gonna you think you're gonna survive.

959
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:40,670
Speaker 0: You know, you got six hours of time in your life.

960
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:43,220
Speaker 0: that you're you know, you're not gonna like pass away soon.

961
01:02:43,361 --> 01:02:46,320
Speaker 0: Right, you can spend the six hours to watch odd taxi and you could do much worse.

962
01:02:46,481 --> 01:02:55,215
Speaker 1: I would actually say this is one of those shows where if you if you like anime at all Just watch the show don't like why you just go watch even if you don't like any.

963
01:02:55,336 --> 01:02:56,620
Speaker 1: I was gonna get to the second part.

964
01:02:57,163 --> 01:03:02,066
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tell my mom to watch this cuz she would Can watch the odd taxi.

965
01:03:02,086 --> 01:03:04,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, both our moms would like this show a lot.

966
01:03:04,936 --> 01:03:07,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think everyone I can't think of many people who wouldn't like the.

967
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:18,700
Speaker 1: I need adult humans that wouldn't like the odds Like the straw man who is like, oh animation is for children and I hate it If you actually get him to watch even a few minutes of the first episode.

968
01:03:19,283 --> 01:03:22,479
Speaker 1: It's hard to imagine a person who is not intrigued by what is going on.

969
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,740
Speaker 0: The only person I could see being turned off by this is one of those.

970
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:31,649
Speaker 0: You know people who can't see past the surface level and it's like like oh this animal people Can't deal with that people.

971
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:33,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone who's like that.

972
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:37,754
Speaker 0: It was so, you know closed-minded in that way or I can't see past that.

973
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:42,030
Speaker 0: That's the only person I can imagine Or like a child right wouldn't?

974
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,920
Speaker 0: I think younger people probably wouldn't enjoy this.

975
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:50,579
Speaker 0: They might think it's a little boring and it's a lot of social commentary stuff going on Especially with the social media guy and the game playing guy.

976
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:53,567
Speaker 1: Oh my god the game playing guy.

977
01:03:53,607 --> 01:03:57,420
Speaker 1: that the episode where you get that guy's backstory was so well written.

978
01:03:58,254 --> 01:03:59,462
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah What he's when he's?

979
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:00,084
Speaker 1: what do you were like?

980
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:05,839
Speaker 1: his mental dialogue like he is narrating his own life and the way he like.

981
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:09,331
Speaker 1: He actually accepts responsibility for the shitty things.

982
01:04:09,351 --> 01:04:11,840
Speaker 1: He's about to do was it was just an interesting notes?

983
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:15,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy's a that's a really great character.

984
01:04:15,488 --> 01:04:17,332
Speaker 0: That is a really great under.

985
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:31,100
Speaker 1: I think that's like an under appreciated part of the show that guy now that is spent especially when there's a moment when there is CCTV footage of that guy doing a thing and someone else sees that and thinks it's a different person.

986
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:36,878
Speaker 0: Yep But yeah, watch the odd taxi and I'm gonna go get food.

987
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:37,240
