1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,411
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, February 11th, 2020.

2
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:11,792
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:14,040
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:16,660
Speaker 1: Rumble nation the board game.

5
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,191
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:26,774
Speaker 1: You might heard me many times on geek nights I. well one day there's two things that rim always says.

7
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:30,870
Speaker 1: one of them is Something about like skeletons and the network time protocol.

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,034
Speaker 1: Maybe the fixed protocol.

9
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:35,529
Speaker 1: and the other thing is Don't run marathons.

10
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:38,887
Speaker 0: They're bad for you, but Time gov got updated.

11
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:39,731
Speaker 1: Yeah time got that.

12
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:40,835
Speaker 1: that's a Monday news though.

13
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:41,498
Speaker 1: I can't spoil.

14
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:56,010
Speaker 1: Okay But time gov did get updated and I will just point out a lot of you pointed this out to me I Think I still have a reputation despite having not touched an NTP demon in like eight.

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but if you had to I haven't had to.

16
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,992
Speaker 1: I don't care anymore.

17
00:01:00,012 --> 00:01:05,175
Speaker 0: I'm if you had to if I had to Yeah, there would be anyone at your company more qualified.

18
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:18,656
Speaker 1: Oh I Hope that there's someone in my company who is using something more precise like PTP For the kinds of synchronization that need to happen, but I am beyond the level.

19
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:19,900
Speaker 1: like I don't log into servers.

20
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:21,491
Speaker 1: I don't even know the whose names.

21
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:29,460
Speaker 1: I'm just saying yeah but So I ended up putting myself in the lottery for the New York Marathon because I figure I'll run one.

22
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:31,952
Speaker 1: I'll do run exactly one marathon.

23
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:33,340
Speaker 1: I've never run a marathon before.

24
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:42,452
Speaker 1: I'll run one get it Okay time and then I can say I've done it and I'll go back to running more reasonable distances like 13 to 16 miles Which is what I do on a regular basis.

25
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:45,066
Speaker 1: You don't survive that one though I feel like I can survive the one.

26
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,090
Speaker 0: but what I'll do?

27
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,647
Speaker 1: this extremely dangerous thing one to up Yeah, but it's more like like skiing like.

28
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,960
Speaker 1: yeah, I've done like double black scary Glade, but I've also seen ski trails.

29
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:58,451
Speaker 0: You should just do all those people who do marathons.

30
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:00,600
Speaker 0: They cheat cutting corners and taking some ways.

31
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:02,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, cheating cross the line first.

32
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,235
Speaker 1: Oh, I could not happens.

33
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,400
Speaker 1: I can wear the cheating shoes.

34
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:06,229
Speaker 0: See what happens if.

35
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:07,180
Speaker 0: well, I mean you could do that, too.

36
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,000
Speaker 0: But just see what happens if you cross the line first ahead of like all the actual professionals.

37
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:22,336
Speaker 1: The problem is the professionals like even if I run at my sprinting pace and on the subway Yeah, but I've got a guide in some hide in some building near the finish line.

38
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:23,480
Speaker 0: I know where the finish line is.

39
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,566
Speaker 0: Yeah I can like bike.

40
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:30,280
Speaker 0: you can give you my bike and that I can use the subway and catch up and get the bike And then you can go to the finish line.

41
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,474
Speaker 1: I think a better way to go is we need someone who looks like me to be hanging out near the finish line and Slip in at the last minute.

42
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:37,020
Speaker 1: I disappear.

43
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:39,189
Speaker 0: So the way the marathon works is.

44
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:39,932
Speaker 0: I've biked along.

45
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,880
Speaker 0: the route is they have these digital checkpoints?

46
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:42,944
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like they're.

47
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:47,300
Speaker 0: you have to get to each point and they'll know how much time was between each point.

48
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:49,660
Speaker 1: So if you skip one, you're disqualified, right?

49
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,892
Speaker 1: You have to go to all of them or they'll use video evidence and it would be pretty.

50
00:02:52,993 --> 00:03:03,487
Speaker 0: it would be pretty hard to You know like really take a major detour because you would either take too long because you had to make the checkpoint and you can't if you Go to two checkpoints real fast.

51
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:05,094
Speaker 0: That's not gonna work, right?

52
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:06,460
Speaker 0: You have to have a reasonable rim.

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,555
Speaker 1: It seems here that you ran 98 miles an hour on.

54
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:10,560
Speaker 1: this saw exactly.

55
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:13,711
Speaker 0: You have to have a reasonable time between the between the spots.

56
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:14,172
Speaker 0: Yeah.

57
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:27,740
Speaker 0: So what I think you got to do right is you need to have Somebody who was like quintuplets or some shit And you can do a relay right and you throw the thing to each other.

58
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you relay it and you just quietly slip out of the race.

59
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:35,179
Speaker 1: cuz right I can run a real fast for like five Miles, I just can't run real fast.

60
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,782
Speaker 0: So what either?

61
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,871
Speaker 0: one person runs five miles six miles.

62
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:47,222
Speaker 0: someone else takes the subway gets in front of them Right takes a rest waits for them to show up you pass off the thing the next person starts going fresh Right.

63
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:51,120
Speaker 0: The next person is taking a break taking a riding on the subway, you know having a drink.

64
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:57,980
Speaker 0: You get out in front of the first person Right you wait for that and if you have two people that's a little hard still cuz you don't run a half marathon.

65
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:02,032
Speaker 0: But if you start getting three four people, right now, we're talking.

66
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:07,036
Speaker 1: thing is I can easily like with no effort I can run a half marathon in about an hour 45, right?

67
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:13,366
Speaker 0: But I'm saying we meaning we need someone to do it at world record pace yeah, which is why we need four or five people.

68
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:20,399
Speaker 1: or like a skilled adult like this time people shoot for is like four ish hours like A little over four hours is pretty damn good for anyone.

69
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:26,020
Speaker 1: So I'm shooting for like a 445 because I've never run a marathon before so we'll see how that goes.

70
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:29,904
Speaker 0: I can bike it in less than four hours easily Pretty quick.

71
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:39,618
Speaker 1: There's like one so one or two, but so to put this in perspective I Run a half marathon, which is literally 13 miles half of a real marathon in an hour and 45 minutes.

72
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:48,417
Speaker 1: The course record for the New York Marathon for a man This guy Jeffrey Mattai is two hours and five minutes.

73
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,791
Speaker 1: So They're running almost twice as fast as me.

74
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:54,678
Speaker 0: That's why I bike faster than that guy ran.

75
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:56,929
Speaker 0: Yeah That's good.

76
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:02,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, so see So many people sign up there's a lottery or you have to like run another races and qualify.

77
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,800
Speaker 0: I don't know why you need a lottery.

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,374
Speaker 0: It's a they close the road and that you look on the pictures and it's just a mob.

79
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:12,269
Speaker 1: so it's like that mob Subset of the number of people who want to run in it.

80
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:13,173
Speaker 0: Good lord.

81
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:13,876
Speaker 0: Let everyone do it.

82
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:14,760
Speaker 1: There's not enough room.

83
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,908
Speaker 1: There's not enough logistic support doing waves.

84
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,695
Speaker 1: No, dude, they already do it in waves.

85
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:19,900
Speaker 1: They do it in a ton of waves.

86
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,645
Speaker 0: Just keep waving.

87
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,036
Speaker 1: Nah, they just shut it down.

88
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:22,499
Speaker 0: do it all day.

89
00:05:23,162 --> 00:05:27,680
Speaker 1: They also cut you off if you're going too slow and there is a way to get in without doing the lottery.

90
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:37,964
Speaker 1: You have to run a half marathon on a real race under a certain time and I thought well I have a really good half marathon time Professional pace.

91
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:43,987
Speaker 1: I'm not that far off, but I would have to shave like 20 ish minutes off of my halftime.

92
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:45,251
Speaker 0: You have to be professional pace.

93
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:49,744
Speaker 1: I'm currently I'm currently reducing about Couple minutes a year.

94
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,430
Speaker 1: is how much I'm making it that time faster.

95
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,798
Speaker 0: Are you decreasing from being old up?

96
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,469
Speaker 1: So funnily while my short distance times are getting worse as I get old My long distance times are getting shorter and shorter and shorter.

97
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,095
Speaker 1: I'm getting better at longer distance.

98
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:02,557
Speaker 0: Eventually.

99
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:03,280
Speaker 0: Everything will get worse.

100
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:05,769
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, eventually Eventually, I'm just gonna be a skeleton.

101
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:07,900
Speaker 1: the race will start and my skeleton just falls over.

102
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,252
Speaker 0: You always see old people doing the race though.

103
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:10,039
Speaker 0: I don't know what's wrong with them.

104
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:17,296
Speaker 1: My goal is to be like that 98 year old skeleton looking dude Running in the middle of the winter at like 5 a.m.

105
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,240
Speaker 1: And Central Park you you do that you can be the usher at a Mets game and I'll get a skeleton man in the park.

106
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:23,805
Speaker 0: That's right.

107
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:27,445
Speaker 0: So in the news Speaking of skeleton men.

108
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:29,671
Speaker 1: This is kind of great.

109
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:31,155
Speaker 1: So if you aren't.

110
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:47,380
Speaker 1: if you don't know Red Dead Redemption Grand Theft Auto with horses in the Wild West has an online mode and people play it like it's a thing but Hackers keep fucking with it because it's not that secure because doesn't matter that much and apparently the hack that's been happy.

111
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,770
Speaker 0: It's not competitive now as far as I'm aware.

112
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,000
Speaker 1: It's just go hang out in this world and be a cowboy.

113
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:54,667
Speaker 1: Do stuff with like with horses.

114
00:06:54,687 --> 00:07:09,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, so people have just been dropping these Really aggressive terrifying two-headed skeletons into the game and if they see a PC They run toward them as fast as possible and proceed to aggressively beat them to get death making scary noises.

115
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,694
Speaker 0: Couldn't you just if you're a strong character though couldn't just kill it.

116
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:13,860
Speaker 1: No, they're invincible to bullets.

117
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,880
Speaker 1: They're basically like almost impossible to kill and they will fuck you up and they're scaring you hit it with something.

118
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:19,360
Speaker 1: Yeah.

119
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:29,681
Speaker 1: So the advice on this Kotaku article is like if one of these is coming after you The best thing to do is to hogtie it and if you succeed at that just drop it in a lake or something and leave It there.

120
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:30,464
Speaker 0: Okay.

121
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,852
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it'll follow you to the ends of the earth.

122
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:35,080
Speaker 1: All right, this is my kind of hack.

123
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:42,600
Speaker 1: I want to see someone hack Oh Weirdly aggressive skeletons into other multiplayer games where they don't belong.

124
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,273
Speaker 0: Well, this reminds me of an idea I had a long time ago, which is to make an MMO.

125
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:49,462
Speaker 0: That is Terminator Universe.

126
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:56,940
Speaker 0: Oh, you got a hack but in the horrible future where it's like apocalyptic and you're you know They're hiding in the oh you're pay a dollar to get a life, right?

127
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, you die you die and you're you're all working together co-op to try to beat Skynet.

128
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:08,900
Speaker 0: But when you go out, it's like alright, I'm gonna leave this cave and try to go and see what's out there.

129
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,687
Speaker 0: It'll be sort of fallout II right?

130
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:18,320
Speaker 0: I imagine right and you go out there and it's like yeah I'm a fucking terminator sees you you're in deep fucking shit the same kind of deep shit.

131
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,359
Speaker 0: You are probably even worse deep shit than if the skeleton sees you.

132
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,360
Speaker 0: That's and that would be the forced co-op would be like, yeah, you would have to work together.

133
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:35,240
Speaker 0: Otherwise if you see literally because remember there's that very brief scene that I'm obsessed with from Terminator 2 Where it shows like the thousand killers or whatever?

134
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,822
Speaker 0: Yeah, right with a giant triangle treads and the big like doom style gatling gun arms or whatever It's like.

135
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:46,940
Speaker 0: yeah, I want to play a game where you walk around and one of those sees you and then you're tiny Gibbs.

136
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:54,262
Speaker 1: It's basically Dark Souls but with guns and co-op Mm-hmm.

137
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:56,087
Speaker 1: So you got any news?

138
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,493
Speaker 0: I got no news going on.

139
00:08:58,513 --> 00:08:58,914
Speaker 0: But I got.

140
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:09,223
Speaker 0: it is two geek bites of two Extremely similar games with different aesthetics and one of them you can get on your mobile device and one of them you can get on Your PC.

141
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:12,320
Speaker 0: and one of them had you know, the aesthetics are both good.

142
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:15,271
Speaker 0: One of them is programmed much better though than the other.

143
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:17,560
Speaker 1: Oh, this one bit one looks real good.

144
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:18,820
Speaker 1: Yeah looks up my alley.

145
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,024
Speaker 0: So there's one game called it.

146
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:35,519
Speaker 0: they're both RTS games and one game is called death crown and it recently had a free DLC Adding a human campaign because the default campaign is you're the skeleton evil people or evil looking even though the king of humans looks like an evil version of.

147
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,759
Speaker 0: Yes, it's like CDI Zelda crossed with like Denethor.

148
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:46,270
Speaker 0: And then the other one is called neon something.

149
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:47,273
Speaker 0: What's it called?

150
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:49,399
Speaker 0: It is called neon amo mio.

151
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:57,436
Speaker 0: No, so the way these RTS games work is You know the problem with a lot of RTS games that I have is I'm slow old and I don't.

152
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:58,420
Speaker 0: I can't click too fast.

153
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:02,953
Speaker 0: So I always want to play something like Starcraft where clicking fast doesn't make you win.

154
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:10,763
Speaker 0: So the way both of these games solve that is Effectively in order to do a thing to build more onto the board You have to.

155
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:11,306
Speaker 0: there's like little.

156
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:17,220
Speaker 0: there's like a little countdown timers sort of like, you know Your cooldowns on your abilities in a MOBA, right?

157
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,225
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like in neon.

158
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:20,169
Speaker 0: amo you're getting.

159
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,720
Speaker 0: you have a timer that's spinning out Tetris pieces.

160
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:36,869
Speaker 0: You have a timer that's spinning out lightning bolts and every time you get a lightning bolt you can put a Tetris piece on the board as long as at least one square of it is adjacent to your existing network and You have swords and every time a sword fills up You can put a piece.

161
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:47,600
Speaker 0: you need a lightning bolt to put the piece anyway but with a lightning bolt and a sword you can put a piece that is Literally on top of an enemy piece and it would destroy anything that's on top of all right.

162
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:59,940
Speaker 0: So we have these three timers building up right and you use them and put stuff on the board conquering space If any piece that you place touches the enemy base, which is just a permanent thing in the corner.

163
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:07,019
Speaker 0: You immediately win all right and some of the maps have stuff on the board and if you're adjacent to it you get it and it gets them.

164
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:07,942
Speaker 0: you gives You an ability.

165
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:11,092
Speaker 0: and also there are three buildings you can build.

166
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:16,090
Speaker 0: you can build those buildings infinitely and freely But you can only build them where they fit.

167
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:18,280
Speaker 0: so it's like one of them is two as a two by four.

168
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:28,760
Speaker 0: So that means you have to arraign, you know fill in an entire two by four space Your tetrominoes in order to then put that building on top of your own stuff, right?

169
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,302
Speaker 0: And it could ours.

170
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:33,320
Speaker 0: if someone comes in with a sword and takes away even one square the building's gone.

171
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,017
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

172
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,224
Speaker 0: So that's neon amo.

173
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:37,534
Speaker 0: and the thing about neon amo that I like is you play it you.

174
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:41,256
Speaker 0: I recommend playing on an iPad against a human against the computers.

175
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:51,976
Speaker 0: kind of meh right against the human because you can put the iPad down on the table and sit on one side of it each and Both play together in real time and I think that's the ideal here.

176
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:55,366
Speaker 0: So death crown Is very similar right is?

177
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:56,229
Speaker 0: you have three buildings.

178
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,520
Speaker 0: you can build the tower building which is sort of like a defensive thing.

179
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,196
Speaker 0: That also gets you some territory and it shoots it incoming bad guys.

180
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:08,299
Speaker 0: a castle Which you put a castle and then you click and drag from the castle to draw a path.

181
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:21,440
Speaker 0: well it makes the shortest path between the place the hex you draw to and Any and basically mobs will March from the castle at a regular rate Attacking all the enemies in the path right until they reach their destination.

182
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:29,860
Speaker 0: And then you can build the farm and the farm Increases your currency regeneration rate and all three of the buildings cost currency to place.

183
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:32,400
Speaker 0: Alright, so it's this very very similar.

184
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,696
Speaker 0: You have a hex map and you're waiting for the currency to build up and you put a building.

185
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:38,002
Speaker 0: you wait for the currency to Build up.

186
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:40,100
Speaker 0: you put a building so being faster doesn't help you.

187
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,039
Speaker 0: It's just choosing the order of what to put and in which hex to put it.

188
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,219
Speaker 0: Mmm, and for castles you have to choose where to draw the line and you can.

189
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:51,112
Speaker 0: actually You can move the line around whenever you want.

190
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:54,628
Speaker 1: pretty I like how I see both mouse Cursors on the map at the same time.

191
00:12:54,648 --> 00:13:04,680
Speaker 0: Yes, because death crown in addition to being this RTS You can play against the computer has I don't know if it has versus mode, but they heavily push their co-op mode.

192
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:12,057
Speaker 0: You would you know you and another person would both be on the same side, you know working to defeat.

193
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:15,660
Speaker 0: I guess the Environment PC controlled enemy, right?

194
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:22,520
Speaker 0: Maybe you both have your own castle or you both have your separate currency piles and the aesthetic of death crown is excellent.

195
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,711
Speaker 1: I'm into this for the aesthetic alone.

196
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:25,756
Speaker 0: Yes, of course you are.

197
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:26,440
Speaker 0: look at that skeleton.

198
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:29,640
Speaker 0: These games aren't perfect by any means.

199
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:34,440
Speaker 0: They both have a neon city crashed a lot on yana mode.

200
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:37,731
Speaker 1: I assume it's Apple device only right now.

201
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:38,172
Speaker 0: I don't know.

202
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:39,135
Speaker 0: it cost three dollars.

203
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:40,600
Speaker 1: Yep says it's only in the App Store.

204
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:44,713
Speaker 0: Okay, and death crown cost more than that, but it's on PC.

205
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got an itch I/o.

206
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:46,880
Speaker 0: you can get on Steam.

207
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:57,880
Speaker 0: but yeah the The problem with death crown is basically is that it gets you know, super annoyingly hard and against the computer by yourself.

208
00:13:59,023 --> 00:14:07,120
Speaker 0: You know the computer can still go super super fast Nah semi cheat because if it couldn't cheat or didn't have any advantages you would just win.

209
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:09,491
Speaker 0: So it's like you beat all the missions.

210
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,220
Speaker 0: I play against it where it's an even footing.

211
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,408
Speaker 0: I just destroyed the computer because I'm smart.

212
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,880
Speaker 0: but when I the harder missions you get later in the game.

213
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,755
Speaker 0: It's like okay now the computer has this crazy building and halfway through the battle.

214
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:26,763
Speaker 0: It just like obliterates your territory and Makes a bunch of hexes.

215
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,070
Speaker 0: You can't build on and it's like alright.

216
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,895
Speaker 0: Well it cheats basically.

217
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:31,838
Speaker 0: so fuck this.

218
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:32,620
Speaker 0: why I'm even bothering?

219
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:34,449
Speaker 0: It's like I played the fun part.

220
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,560
Speaker 0: I'm good, but it's cheap and it's quick.

221
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:37,403
Speaker 0: I played.

222
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:41,220
Speaker 0: I basically played all there was to play in a very brief period of time.

223
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:45,498
Speaker 0: Not bad, and I didn't feel disappointed even though I got to cheaty parts.

224
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:46,040
Speaker 1: I'm into it.

225
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,540
Speaker 0: I will poke at this game actually beat the cheaty parts in the first campaign But in the new DLC campaign, I did not beat the cheaty part.

226
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,280
Speaker 1: We'll see if it sucks me in like Advance Wars or war groove did where everything it's not like that.

227
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,892
Speaker 0: Yes, it's much less.

228
00:14:58,912 --> 00:14:59,980
Speaker 0: It's much simpler, right?

229
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,571
Speaker 0: It's like a you look you can one play one game.

230
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,704
Speaker 0: All you do is put two trauma knows on a board And the other game.

231
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:10,860
Speaker 0: all you do is choose one of three buildings to build whenever you have enough currency to do so.

232
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:11,863
Speaker 0: That's all you do.

233
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:13,166
Speaker 0: you do almost nothing else.

234
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:25,100
Speaker 0: It's like pared down to this absolute minimum thing while still being Sort of really unique and interesting because they're pretty much aren't any games that I've seen like these except for these two games.

235
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,750
Speaker 1: Well that is in general like the games that get us going.

236
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:39,180
Speaker 1: the most are the ones that are like either a perfect Expression of their craft like hyper polished or the ones that are distilled down to the core essence of something unique Mm-hmm, like that's what gets us going elegance and simplicity.

237
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:43,699
Speaker 1: So yeah, I will try death crown and it looks like I can't play the other one.

238
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:45,207
Speaker 0: We can play it after the show.

239
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:45,950
Speaker 0: It'll take five seconds.

240
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,191
Speaker 0: Yeah.

241
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:48,980
Speaker 1: All right in some other news I saw an interesting headline.

242
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,536
Speaker 1: So I want to see what the deal was and the headline was Why the Paris Overwatch League team is based out of New Jersey this season.

243
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:55,520
Speaker 0: Is there a New Jersey team?

244
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:58,815
Speaker 0: So the New York team I know doesn't play in New Jersey.

245
00:15:58,855 --> 00:15:59,560
Speaker 0: they play in New York.

246
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:06,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it like all good people do but Paris eternal Seems to be the only team they're still gonna play there.

247
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,115
Speaker 0: What about the London team?

248
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:09,557
Speaker 1: Uh who cares about the London team?

249
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:12,520
Speaker 1: because We'll get to that in a second Spitfire.

250
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:18,845
Speaker 1: So basically Paris eternal is going to play their home game still in Paris Like like they would like.

251
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:25,928
Speaker 0: they want their fan base in Paris like so but if they New York has to play at Paris New York and Paris are gonna get on a flight to Paris.

252
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:26,550
Speaker 0: think so.

253
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,837
Speaker 0: Okay, but that's why it seems wasteful.

254
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:31,179
Speaker 1: I mean Look over there was well.

255
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:38,780
Speaker 1: So the reason they're doing this is actually very interesting and it's a problem that is kind of unique to eSports in their nascent form.

256
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:45,040
Speaker 1: Basically the Overwatch League team in Paris wants to scrimmage and practice with the other teams.

257
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:53,520
Speaker 1: Almost every Overwatch League team is in North America except for like the handful of them that are in mainland China

258
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:54,758
Speaker 0: mm-hmm, so

259
00:16:55,642 --> 00:17:06,124
Speaker 1: Between and like other parts of Asia There's basically the Asia set and the North American set and then there's only two European teams London Spitfire and Paris eternal.

260
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:07,852
Speaker 1: Paris eternal is a competitor.

261
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:13,200
Speaker 1: They're like number five in the league right now Like they're doing fine London Spitfire dead last in the league.

262
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:18,012
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Paris team just wants to be able to practice with other teams.

263
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:24,280
Speaker 1: This is interesting because think about it Rangers don't just practice with like the Red Wings, right?

264
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:33,720
Speaker 0: Oh, there's preseason games where they would semi practice, but yeah, right They're not really not even putting out their best players right when you're a professional sports team, right?

265
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:34,987
Speaker 0: That's you know professional.

266
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,723
Speaker 0: you practice against Yourself.

267
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:40,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, right your own team, right?

268
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:49,711
Speaker 0: So if you're hockey team, it's like, okay We'll just put our first line out there with one goalie against their second line with the backup goalie And two defenseman on each side, there you go top four defenseman.

269
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:52,480
Speaker 0: we can practice against ourselves at ice hockey.

270
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,950
Speaker 0: We don't need you know to practice against some other team, right?

271
00:17:56,451 --> 00:18:02,085
Speaker 0: And if you are let's say I don't know Professional boxer, right?

272
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,631
Speaker 0: You're not practicing against the person you're going to fight.

273
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:08,020
Speaker 0: you hire people right to like spar with you, right?

274
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,843
Speaker 0: That's their job.

275
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:13,300
Speaker 0: If you're a professional football team, right you have a practice squad.

276
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,827
Speaker 0: It's literally a really good job.

277
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:21,539
Speaker 0: Actually if you're on the NFL practice squad you make Surprising amount of money even though no one knows who the hell you are.

278
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:26,638
Speaker 0: There's a chance you could end up on the real team If enough people get hurt or there's no one better than you to go get.

279
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:28,407
Speaker 0: yeah And that's a real job.

280
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:38,229
Speaker 0: like you're on the practice squad and during football season your job is to help the team practice and play against the real players and then You just don't go and you're not in the real games.

281
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:39,252
Speaker 0: You're not on the team.

282
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,640
Speaker 0: You just have a sort of help, right?

283
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:42,046
Speaker 0: So why?

284
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:44,323
Speaker 0: The pain?

285
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:51,120
Speaker 0: I have a lot of ideas as to why the pink thing is understandable But why are these teams practicing against each other?

286
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,907
Speaker 0: I think it's probably not have.

287
00:18:53,268 --> 00:19:00,352
Speaker 0: just if you're the Paris team go and find The second best team of overwatch people in Paris and practice against them.

288
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:03,580
Speaker 0: think the problem is the lizard effect runs the league.

289
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,486
Speaker 0: They should be able to help you out by looking at Blizzard, you know players.

290
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:08,049
Speaker 0: this

291
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:11,286
Speaker 1: problem happens in almost all eSports though They should

292
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:16,952
Speaker 0: be able to look at the blizzard, you know users and say who's the best five players in France that aren't on this team

293
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:22,153
Speaker 1: now because most of those best players aren't actually Members of like specific teams you could practice against.

294
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:22,876
Speaker 0: you don't have to.

295
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:23,620
Speaker 0: they could just be people.

296
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,304
Speaker 0: No, fine.

297
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:25,492
Speaker 1: That's worthless practice.

298
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:30,075
Speaker 1: for this at this level of play You need to practice against a team that's acting as a complete unit.

299
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:34,013
Speaker 0: That's the only I'm saying The five best people they can or how.

300
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:34,878
Speaker 0: it's five people, right?

301
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:46,515
Speaker 0: Find the best people you can find who live in France who are playing overwatch by looking at the overwatch competitive rankings and then Hire them and make them work as a team as your practice opponent first off.

302
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:47,939
Speaker 1: It's six now five and two.

303
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:48,694
Speaker 0: What do I know?

304
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,900
Speaker 1: Find the six best people there aren't like the people who are good enough at overwatch to compete with the people in the Pro League.

305
00:19:56,161 --> 00:20:00,059
Speaker 1: There's still a pretty wide Gulf and there aren't that many great players out there.

306
00:20:00,642 --> 00:20:05,040
Speaker 1: There's not just a low supply and I think that is the case with most truly.

307
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:10,059
Speaker 0: Anyone who's good enough to compete against is on a team pretty much, right?

308
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,631
Speaker 0: But as the thing is like even the NFL the people on the practice team obviously are not as good as the people on the Real team, but they still get valuable practice from them.

309
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:19,940
Speaker 1: Yep, and I think they do that, too.

310
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:28,435
Speaker 1: I think it's just that there is definitely a culture of play and it's not just overwatch League It's other eSports to of doing scrimmages and like practice games with other.

311
00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:30,120
Speaker 0: those are pretty pre-season thing.

312
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,150
Speaker 0: I said, you know, but that shouldn't be your practice.

313
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:36,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, but maybe what they need to do is like Okay, so are you telling me so it's six people right?

314
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:37,920
Speaker 0: Are you telling me that the Paris?

315
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,285
Speaker 0: What are they called eternal?

316
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,214
Speaker 0: the Paris eternal are only six people?

317
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:43,826
Speaker 1: I Don't know what the backup roster is.

318
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:43,987
Speaker 1: Cuz.

319
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:46,600
Speaker 1: honestly while I watch the games, I don't pay much attention, right?

320
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:58,418
Speaker 0: I feel like if you simply just had a requirement that you have to have 12 people and there's your people to practice against I don't know if there's 12 great overwatch players and they could but every team has to have 12 people.

321
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:06,640
Speaker 0: So if you just said this is the number of people that will be in the league then Yeah, teams are gonna have a bottom, you know, everyone has a bottom line, right?

322
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:15,440
Speaker 1: you've got people partly to though that unlike say football like American football the Variety of skills that are required among all the players.

323
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:27,060
Speaker 1: It's hard to find people who can change up a team a six unit like team Strategy on the fly because the backup players and all those like lower tier players aren't gonna have like the dedicated coaches, right?

324
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:33,398
Speaker 0: That's the thing is you need, you know developmental league right where you can make good players.

325
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:35,715
Speaker 0: there does no support right this.

326
00:21:35,817 --> 00:21:41,297
Speaker 0: the Developmental league for pretty much all eSports is kid gets good at the game at home on his own.

327
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:42,702
Speaker 1: Yeah, we need more I need.

328
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:48,103
Speaker 0: and then when you reach school team, right when you reach a certain level of play They do have.

329
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:50,752
Speaker 0: actually they have been doing great support for college play.

330
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,180
Speaker 0: I think they have there's across the board.

331
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,257
Speaker 0: I think eSports has done a lot of focus on.

332
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:57,740
Speaker 0: partly We're just in the very early days of that.

333
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,940
Speaker 0: I think that the the caring about the college play is extremely low except for people at the college.

334
00:22:04,502 --> 00:22:09,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I literally will not watch anyone except the actual overwatch league.

335
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, you never see college eSports getting a lot of views on streams.

336
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:14,398
Speaker 0: At least I haven't seen it.

337
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:19,145
Speaker 0: But I think the people at the colleges I have seen Caring about their team.

338
00:22:19,226 --> 00:22:25,860
Speaker 1: if it's good though if our IT had had an overwatch team and we would have cared about it at The time yeah, they've already had a tribes to team.

339
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,684
Speaker 1: I would have tried to join.

340
00:22:26,704 --> 00:22:29,960
Speaker 0: our IT does have an overwatch team tribes to do you care about it at all?

341
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,746
Speaker 1: Cuz I know I'm not there right now.

342
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:33,352
Speaker 0: exactly were I there?

343
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:35,499
Speaker 0: I might care but anyway.

344
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:38,723
Speaker 0: But also the point is there's no Developmental leagues.

345
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:43,398
Speaker 0: development is like get good enough on your own and then maybe someone will find you.

346
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:43,900
Speaker 0: right though.

347
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,432
Speaker 0: Developmental leagues to produce people to practice with.

348
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:56,620
Speaker 1: what would professional sports look like if cross-team Practice was actually a part of that culture from day.

349
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,640
Speaker 1: Well, like what if half the baseball team is a little bit of cross?

350
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,627
Speaker 1: But what if they were more like?

351
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,996
Speaker 1: what if that was part of much?

352
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:13,580
Speaker 1: I'm saying The eSports because it is a relatively new thing and it's sort of a green field or a blue ocean Depending how you want to look at it, but they could Theoretically try like very different cultural practices.

353
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:25,451
Speaker 1: It'd be interesting to see how a sport will evolve if the players on the teams Like practice cross-team regularly and that's just part of what they do a lot less secret-keeping exactly then there's there's no more like I saw.

354
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:34,280
Speaker 0: because strat also because You know the preseason in eSports isn't like gonna damage your body like in hockey or football.

355
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll their best players can play.

356
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:42,940
Speaker 0: and also because you don't have this sort of You know, if they had the developmental league, right?

357
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:50,997
Speaker 0: It would be more like a baseball spring training where your people are trying out for the team All right, and you're you're seeing what minor leaguers can do, right?

358
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,403
Speaker 0: But they don't have people.

359
00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:53,747
Speaker 0: they need to see what they can do.

360
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:54,911
Speaker 0: right because there's.

361
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:57,199
Speaker 0: no there's no farm system at all.

362
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:58,778
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all kind of ad hoc.

363
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:04,960
Speaker 0: So without the farm system is nothing else to do with those preseason games other than let the top people practice.

364
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:10,060
Speaker 0: They need that farm system and developmental league to get the people which all this stuff will come.

365
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,720
Speaker 0: It's just because you're not gonna solve the ping problem, right?

366
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,102
Speaker 0: This is the.

367
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:15,879
Speaker 0: this is the real solution and it's a thing you need anyway.

368
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:35,659
Speaker 1: Yeah other reasons and it happens to also solve your practice problem Yep, but also like eSports real competition for most games still requires extreme low latency connections but anyway things of the day what he got.

369
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:48,829
Speaker 0: So there's been a lot of hubbub lately because Apple successfully Since the release of you know, the original iPhone in 19 2007 hot seven routine years ago.

370
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:51,420
Speaker 1: Yeah start saying hot again for the not seven.

371
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,815
Speaker 0: They managed to kill flash and they pretty much succeeded.

372
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:55,940
Speaker 0: No one has flash anymore.

373
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,551
Speaker 0: When's the last time you went to anything that required flash or got the pop-up?

374
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:07,612
Speaker 1: that said install flash only when I go to sites that broadcast Certain sporting events without prior written consent.

375
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,780
Speaker 0: I don't even need it for those only the shitty ones.

376
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:24,324
Speaker 0: anyway, the point is flash is pretty much dead basically, but even Adobe changed the name of flash to like Animators and something like that because you only pretty much use it now for making animations and not for you know Making, you know web

377
00:25:24,504 --> 00:25:24,986
Speaker 1: entire

378
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:27,232
Speaker 0: website embedded web things or entire.

379
00:25:27,252 --> 00:25:36,623
Speaker 0: but yeah, so there's been a crazy You know rumble because people are like, oh shit We don't we want flash to die We don't really care.

380
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:48,290
Speaker 0: but there's a bajillion flash games this entire history of the internet from the late 90s through You know the late 2000s yeah, like maybe like, you know, ten plus years worth of stuff

381
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:49,573
Speaker 1: and the stuff and it's

382
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:59,440
Speaker 0: an enormous amount of content much of Which was important and or revolutionary right despite having its problems of being flash and not being accessible, etc.

383
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:02,869
Speaker 1: Point you for example to radish skull and devil doll.

384
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:11,780
Speaker 0: All right homestar runner, you know, there's a wide variety of quality right, but Preserving it is it historically important?

385
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,877
Speaker 0: We don't want to let it go.

386
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:16,312
Speaker 0: So somebody did manage to come to the rescue.

387
00:26:16,372 --> 00:26:18,600
Speaker 0: here is blue Maxima's flashpoint.

388
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:29,953
Speaker 0: What this is is a thing you can download and they they took all the open source tools that they could get and they combined them together sort of like Harmy's Star Wars.

389
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:37,254
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and they made basically a software that can run flash right equivalently That's not Adobe.

390
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:38,177
Speaker 0: So you got your emulator.

391
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:52,070
Speaker 0: now, just like you have an open source flash emulator sort of thing and then they've gone around trying to collect as many flash things as they could and then Modifying their code to make them all the things work properly.

392
00:26:52,130 --> 00:27:02,901
Speaker 0: And so you download this and you will get 30,000 plus flash games 2400 plus animations And it runs on like all kinds of different platforms.

393
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:05,768
Speaker 0: You just got to compile, you know, you might need to compile the code Who knows?

394
00:27:07,431 --> 00:27:13,210
Speaker 0: But yeah, you can get this preserved library of the flash things of the internet.

395
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:18,990
Speaker 0: It's not a perfect preservation because they're not like embedded in the web page as they were originally.

396
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:25,630
Speaker 0: It's more like ah Here is the tablet taken out of the ancient ruin and put on a stand in a museum kind of thing.

397
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:28,320
Speaker 0: But hey, it's way better than nothing.

398
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:29,303
Speaker 1: It's important work.

399
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:36,408
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is an important thing And in case some sort of copyright thing comes down on this download it today.

400
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:43,753
Speaker 1: Yep Get it preserve it on your nose because like some of these things like people have made like YouTube videos of a lot of flash Experiences.

401
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:48,272
Speaker 1: but well that works for some things but not all things like even homestar runner Like there's.

402
00:27:48,373 --> 00:27:49,457
Speaker 0: all those are runners.

403
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:57,869
Speaker 1: animations were interactive to a small degree Yep, and this is very similar to that problem of how do you recreate the experience of an old MMO?

404
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,239
Speaker 1: Like how do you emulate?

405
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:00,149
Speaker 0: that's even worse than this?

406
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:17,290
Speaker 0: Yeah So but that's another thing is some of these flash things did have either Online components to the MMO level or they had online components Just like high scoreboards or chats or these sorts of things and those are obviously definitely completely gone.

407
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:20,999
Speaker 0: I even remember a lot of flash experiences.

408
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:29,281
Speaker 0: For example, I remember one summer at RIT I think we're in colony maybe and Nintendo had like a summer camp thing they did.

409
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:35,170
Speaker 0: it was like a special website You would sign up for and go to and it was official Nintendo biz.

410
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,435
Speaker 0: it was like welcome to official Nintendo summer camp.

411
00:28:37,455 --> 00:28:41,543
Speaker 0: does all kinds of stuff in here, right and You know, there's.

412
00:28:41,584 --> 00:28:47,660
Speaker 0: there are things like that that happened in those days that have been not preserved in any way whatsoever.

413
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:48,587
Speaker 0: They're completely gone.

414
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:49,212
Speaker 0: Goodbye camp.

415
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:55,174
Speaker 1: Hyrule Old annual online virtual camp sponsored by Nintendo first came to life in 1995.

416
00:28:55,174 --> 00:28:56,398
Speaker 0: That must have been it.

417
00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:56,638
Speaker 0: Yeah.

418
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:58,725
Speaker 1: Yep I think that was it.

419
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:00,050
Speaker 1: I don't remember this at all.

420
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,700
Speaker 0: I only did it once and there was definitely flash involved.

421
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:04,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like in chat rooms.

422
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,112
Speaker 1: I feel like whatever this was.

423
00:29:05,172 --> 00:29:06,760
Speaker 1: I either ignored you doing it or whatever.

424
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,830
Speaker 0: Like a day I Saw I saw a post about it somewhere.

425
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,613
Speaker 0: I signed up for it.

426
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:14,020
Speaker 0: I did it for one day and that was it.

427
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, so

428
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:31,940
Speaker 1: here's the thing most people know Penn and Teller like as they look today and like The magic they've done over the years, but I remember a very different Penn and Teller because as a kid I remember watching either VHS tapes and sometimes live broadcasts of the early Penn and Teller.

429
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:33,120
Speaker 0: I mean that was a big thing.

430
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,360
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know if it's still a thing cuz I don't watch television.

431
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:41,917
Speaker 1: I used to watch a lot of magic performances in on TV in the 80s 90s David Copperfield exactly in the 80s 90s.

432
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,428
Speaker 0: Magic was like a like it was always wouldn't?

433
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:50,611
Speaker 0: there wouldn't be like regular magic TV shows like frequently, but there'd be big right, there would be like these.

434
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:52,622
Speaker 0: that was the thing like Special.

435
00:29:52,762 --> 00:29:56,593
Speaker 0: a magician is gonna do a special on TV hour-long thing.

436
00:29:56,894 --> 00:29:59,280
Speaker 0: David Copperfield's gonna make a Statue of Liberty disappear.

437
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,207
Speaker 0: Well, it's gonna be an hour-long special.

438
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:04,178
Speaker 0: he's gonna fly, you know Penn and Teller is gonna.

439
00:30:04,198 --> 00:30:06,600
Speaker 0: they're gonna do that The the drowning trick they did.

440
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:17,520
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like they would come up with a new trick and they would do a TV special as like an advertisement for themselves And also as a TV show to sell ads and it was like a fucking event because there was no internet.

441
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:24,980
Speaker 1: So and you know see magic like in your town Frequently and like people would tape them and rewatch them try to figure out how they did him.

442
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:27,016
Speaker 1: Everyone would be talking about him in school the next day.

443
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:37,800
Speaker 1: Yep So this YouTube video is a compilation is like 27 minutes long of a lot of the early Early Penn and Teller stuff when they were on public access.

444
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:41,409
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, although it was Penn and Teller go public.

445
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:48,974
Speaker 0: It was on channel 4 in like 1986 where if it's public access it had a location.

446
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:50,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, or it might have been public television.

447
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,498
Speaker 1: I'm not a hundred percent sure cuz I don't remember how TV worked like.

448
00:30:53,558 --> 00:31:00,079
Speaker 1: I was not All right, but I know they also did a lot of stuff for like telethons for public TV and all sorts like.

449
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,024
Speaker 0: well Yeah, telethons.

450
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:03,054
Speaker 0: You always have like a magician come out and do like one trick.

451
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,360
Speaker 0: Yeah a telethon, right?

452
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,575
Speaker 1: I remember watching telethons as a kid Mm-hmm.

453
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:14,514
Speaker 1: I remember especially watching the one telethon that was also a charity auction because every now and then Nerdy shit would come up in the telethon.

454
00:31:14,534 --> 00:31:22,760
Speaker 0: Brian swords of your Usually just never gonna be able to think about a telethon again without thinking about Brian's words of York.

455
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,808
Speaker 1: There are who's still around.

456
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:35,037
Speaker 1: there are certainly okay, dude, certainly enjoying themselves In the better moment, we're gonna be live at PAX East which is not yet sold out and occurs in 16 days.

457
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:40,459
Speaker 1: Well, 15 days 15 hours 6 minutes and 55 seconds give or take.

458
00:31:42,346 --> 00:31:43,360
Speaker 1: All the badges are available.

459
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:51,500
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's because they're selling more badges or because Literally every hotel in the stupid city of Boston is sold out and people just can't get hotel rooms.

460
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:53,387
Speaker 1: But PAX East is huge.

461
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:54,030
Speaker 1: We will be there.

462
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,954
Speaker 1: We're doing one panel.

463
00:31:55,516 --> 00:31:56,480
Speaker 1: Take your fucking turn.

464
00:31:57,022 --> 00:32:01,659
Speaker 1: We flagged it as 13 plus so we're gonna say the word fuck a lot and it's gonna be a good time.

465
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:04,287
Speaker 1: Otherwise When we're not enforcing we'll just be.

466
00:32:04,347 --> 00:32:08,268
Speaker 0: if you are going if you're not going to PAX East you can see that panel on YouTube Already.

467
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:08,572
Speaker 1: Yep.

468
00:32:08,613 --> 00:32:11,366
Speaker 0: It's all Are going to PAX East.

469
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:15,625
Speaker 0: you can just not go to that panel and watch it out on YouTube instead and do it's with your Time.

470
00:32:15,665 --> 00:32:16,800
Speaker 0: do something else at PAX East.

471
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:24,260
Speaker 1: However, if you have a friend who perhaps needs to see take your fucking turn because perhaps they need to take them.

472
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,340
Speaker 0: Make them watch it on YouTube.

473
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:30,119
Speaker 1: No You should tell them that they have to go to our panel and then they'll go.

474
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:40,290
Speaker 1: They'll waste an hour seeing our panel and at the end We're gonna tell everyone you couldn't watch this whole thing on YouTube and they'll feel slighted for having wasted their hour And that's your tiny revenge.

475
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:42,019
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll take their turn faster.

476
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:48,300
Speaker 1: Okay Otherwise, there's other stuff coming up, but we don't have any major conventions until I'll probably be at Connecticut.

477
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,869
Speaker 1: We got PAX West coming up in September.

478
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,840
Speaker 0: The book club book is tale of Genji.

479
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,337
Speaker 0: I'm reading it on the train as I planned.

480
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:57,445
Speaker 1: Yep I'm.

481
00:32:57,465 --> 00:33:03,119
Speaker 1: uh, I've mentioned my thoughts on Genji But I gotta get further in before I decide if I actually like Genji or not.

482
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:11,170
Speaker 1: So far I live I if I list all the characters I like or care about it all Genji is not on that list Characters that I barely like.

483
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,760
Speaker 1: I have to look back and figure out what their name is.

484
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:21,168
Speaker 1: I'm more invested in Genji's brother-in-law his cousin Genji's mom's uncle's And I was the other.

485
00:33:21,188 --> 00:33:22,939
Speaker 1: this whole like right versus left thing goes.

486
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:27,293
Speaker 1: I was reading a Wikipedia on like the details of what I didn't even try to understand it.

487
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:28,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.

488
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:33,850
Speaker 1: uh, I Don't understand it enough to explain it to you now But I read a Wikipedia article on it and it might help me.

489
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:42,819
Speaker 0: when I'm watching all like I keep watching like samurai movies You know emperors and shoguns and shit and it doesn't seem to come into it, but maybe I'm just missing it.

490
00:33:43,261 --> 00:33:45,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, the shogun stuff would be way later.

491
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:49,518
Speaker 1: Okay, so, uh speaking of that's why we played a game at.

492
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:55,054
Speaker 1: I think I played it with Emily and a couple other people at PAX unplugged in.

493
00:33:55,154 --> 00:34:02,792
Speaker 0: I saw it and first look at PAX unplugged and then Matt The enforcer put it into the library for PAX East.

494
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,200
Speaker 0: but then I was like, hey that game we played at PAX unplugged.

495
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,795
Speaker 0: I got it and he played it and he's like, oh and he put it back into first look Yeah after he saw that it was good.

496
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:15,129
Speaker 0: So This game rumble nation What was the Japanese name again?

497
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,442
Speaker 1: Oh god, we had Emily to help us with this Something.

498
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:22,835
Speaker 1: it's complicated but dependent like the meaning of the name of this.

499
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:24,100
Speaker 0: Oh tank on a dough.

500
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:27,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the the it paste it into Google.

501
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:38,804
Speaker 0: It'll be like world sound right, so apparently tanka means like everything under the heavens and May doe can mean like, you know Rumbling ringing curses.

502
00:34:38,925 --> 00:34:42,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, like sort of like a sound plus a shaking was kind of.

503
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:51,719
Speaker 0: so you understand why they use the rumble nation As a valid translation, but I guess the original Japanese meaning is more.

504
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:55,748
Speaker 0: you know is Rumble not as or not as corny.

505
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,873
Speaker 1: Yeah rumble nation.

506
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:58,620
Speaker 1: Is there a corny name in English?

507
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,629
Speaker 0: It's like they translated it kind you could you could see.

508
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:03,575
Speaker 0: oh I can see why you translate is that?

509
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:07,900
Speaker 0: but the feeling of those Words despite having a similar meaning is way off.

510
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,735
Speaker 1: I feel like we should just call it the upheaval of all the lands under heaven.

511
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:12,257
Speaker 0: Sure.

512
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:12,960
Speaker 0: We could call it that.

513
00:35:13,643 --> 00:35:17,200
Speaker 0: So this game is actually not a complicated or long game.

514
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:30,220
Speaker 1: this game takes five minutes to learn how to play from reading the rules four minutes to teach to anyone if you've read those rules and Maybe 20 minutes to play if someone is super slow.

515
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,673
Speaker 0: I think it might take 30 minutes like the complexity of like sir.

516
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:35,479
Speaker 0: Oh that kind of level but plus one.

517
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:44,120
Speaker 1: But in terms of like the meat of like the strategy of the game It's like a super condensed and extremely tight El Grande.

518
00:35:44,264 --> 00:35:55,066
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Like distill El Grande down to its like fundamental essence and then add one really clever mechanic and then one Really clever twist

519
00:35:55,086 --> 00:36:02,760
Speaker 0: you're getting a lot of game in a small space and being like, wow That's not it's not a lot of game compared to games that are actually a lot of game.

520
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:11,038
Speaker 0: but for the amount of time I spent on it and the complexity of the rules, I really got a lot out of this and And I don't get tired of it, right?

521
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:18,280
Speaker 0: Well, you think if the replay value could run out good I think if you played this a lot you might go man.

522
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:26,480
Speaker 0: But if you use this I think as your warm-up game as opposed to something really, you know A lot of you will warm up with something super simple like maybe like a six nymph.

523
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:27,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

524
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:30,358
Speaker 0: this will get you, you know ramped up more than a six nymphs.

525
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:36,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, this one and I guess what I like about it is that it is good enough to be your primary game But it's so fast

526
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:41,420
Speaker 0: that it's good enough to be your primary game when you're playing with less powerful gamers

527
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:52,980
Speaker 1: Yep, or if you don't have a lot of time or if you're craving the brain feel of a game like El Grande But you don't want to spend an hour and ten minutes you want to spend fifteen minutes

528
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:53,722
Speaker 0: Or you want to.

529
00:36:53,983 --> 00:36:59,060
Speaker 0: you want to get the brain feel of like the kind of game that you could only play if you had a bunch of nerds around.

530
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:01,290
Speaker 0: But you don't have a bunch of nerds around.

531
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:06,817
Speaker 0: maybe you want to get like, you know Your siblings to play this and they're not super hardcore, right?

532
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:12,296
Speaker 0: Maybe you could get them to play this and get some of the brain feel you like But also they could play it.

533
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,280
Speaker 1: Yep, and the game, you know, we talked about in the very beginning of the show like elegance and that's what we like in game design.

534
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:20,159
Speaker 1: See, this is one of the most elegant board games I have ever seen.

535
00:37:20,784 --> 00:37:21,834
Speaker 0: So here's how the game works.

536
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:22,318
Speaker 0: You got a map.

537
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and it's pretty simple.

538
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:25,431
Speaker 0: You want to have you know each.

539
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:27,720
Speaker 0: we randomly put numbers on all the spaces.

540
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:29,105
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how it has.

541
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:32,677
Speaker 0: how many points each space is worth and they're two two through twelve.

542
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:33,079
Speaker 1: It's two six.

543
00:37:33,662 --> 00:37:35,419
Speaker 0: So there's your replay value right there.

544
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:35,761
Speaker 0: Is it?

545
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:39,520
Speaker 0: every time you play different spaces on the map are worth different amount of points?

546
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:41,988
Speaker 0: Obviously the spot that's worth twelve is the best.

547
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:42,971
Speaker 0: the spot that was two.

548
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:43,472
Speaker 0: who cares?

549
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:49,083
Speaker 0: and then whoever has the most dudes in each Space wins the points for that space GG.

550
00:37:49,304 --> 00:37:50,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, Colonel Blotto game.

551
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:54,300
Speaker 0: You're putting the most dudes in the spots and some spots are better than others.

552
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,163
Speaker 0: Now here's how it works.

553
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,471
Speaker 0: You can't just put your fucking dudes wherever you want.

554
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:59,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the clever mechanic.

555
00:37:59,337 --> 00:38:07,308
Speaker 0: now you roll 3d6 right on every turn and then you pick One of the d6.

556
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,519
Speaker 0: is that you rolled?

557
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:11,860
Speaker 0: Yeah to tell you how many dudes you're gonna put out.

558
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,630
Speaker 0: So let's say I roll a one a two and a three.

559
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:18,292
Speaker 0: I could put one dude out I could put two dudes out or I could put three dudes.

560
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:19,437
Speaker 1: No, that's not it.

561
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,160
Speaker 1: You're off a little bit.

562
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:20,842
Speaker 1: I'm awful of it.

563
00:38:20,983 --> 00:38:21,746
Speaker 1: a water or two.

564
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:22,167
Speaker 1: Let's you go.

565
00:38:22,328 --> 00:38:23,150
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

566
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:25,258
Speaker 0: It's it's it's the number divided by two.

567
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:26,120
Speaker 1: round it up All right.

568
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,128
Speaker 0: So I roll a one a three and a six.

569
00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:31,923
Speaker 0: I could put one two or three dudes out because you get to divide the d6 By two.

570
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:32,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

571
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,520
Speaker 0: You can only can't put more than three dudes out at once.

572
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,933
Speaker 0: Anyway, the other two dice that you leave behind, right?

573
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:39,395
Speaker 0: So I rolled.

574
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:41,080
Speaker 0: I rolled what I said a one a three and a six.

575
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:41,377
Speaker 0: Yeah.

576
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:44,100
Speaker 0: So if I decide to put one dude out with the one.

577
00:38:44,662 --> 00:38:49,299
Speaker 0: That dude is gonna go in spot number nine because the three plus six is nine.

578
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:50,788
Speaker 0: It's a placement.

579
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:57,120
Speaker 0: if I want to put two dudes out They're right that I have to use the number three dice to get my two dudes.

580
00:38:57,563 --> 00:39:00,040
Speaker 0: Those two dudes are gonna go in spot number seven.

581
00:39:00,602 --> 00:39:04,320
Speaker 0: And if I want to put dudes, I want to put three dudes on the board.

582
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,520
Speaker 0: It's going into four it's going into four.

583
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:11,404
Speaker 0: So not only does this give you an interesting decision But also luck.

584
00:39:11,545 --> 00:39:17,749
Speaker 1: each turn of three possible moves and you can do a reroll But we don't get one if your role and your role sucks.

585
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:18,812
Speaker 1: Well, that sucks right.

586
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:19,816
Speaker 0: you gives you.

587
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:21,140
Speaker 0: it limits your choices.

588
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:25,037
Speaker 0: You're not sitting there thinking like super hard on your turn because you've only got three options.

589
00:39:25,178 --> 00:39:25,660
Speaker 0: Yep, right?

590
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:25,949
Speaker 0: You're not.

591
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,300
Speaker 0: Analysis paralysis yourself to death there with all your choice.

592
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,630
Speaker 1: It also forces you to be a little tactical like you might have.

593
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,940
Speaker 1: you might be stuck doing something that feels suboptimal.

594
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:37,080
Speaker 1: So now you might have to base like your strategy for the rest of the game.

595
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:37,742
Speaker 1: Oh, you've always.

596
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:48,299
Speaker 0: mechanic is also genius in that it is easy to put lots of dudes on The spots that aren't worth a lot of points.

597
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:54,140
Speaker 0: Yeah It's hard to put a lot of dudes on the spots that aren't like wherever the seven is right.

598
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,944
Speaker 0: Anyone can just be.

599
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:56,571
Speaker 1: so let's go in tight throw it.

600
00:39:56,712 --> 00:39:59,684
Speaker 0: Say I want to let's say I get lucky I get to put.

601
00:39:59,804 --> 00:40:02,712
Speaker 0: actually get put to put dudes on the 12.

602
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:05,240
Speaker 0: You already have to roll two sixes, right?

603
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,420
Speaker 0: So I roll two out of the three dice that I roll two or sixes.

604
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,640
Speaker 0: I can finally put dudes on the 12 spot the most valuable spot on the board, right?

605
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,639
Speaker 0: So almost no one can ever put dudes there.

606
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:21,940
Speaker 0: Because how often is someone in the game gonna roll two sixes out of 3d six and yell in the same role?

607
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:26,471
Speaker 1: My 299 and Gonsher and clever is just staring at me for this.

608
00:40:26,672 --> 00:40:31,669
Speaker 0: and then that third D is gonna determine how many dudes I get to put on the 12.

609
00:40:31,669 --> 00:40:33,841
Speaker 0: So it's like alright, I'm definitely going on the 12.

610
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:36,480
Speaker 0: I'm using both of my sixes to go there, right?

611
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,367
Speaker 0: But my third dice is a two.

612
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:46,550
Speaker 0: so I can only put one dude on the 12. instead of doing that I could have put three dudes on like The seven or the eight or whatever.

613
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,340
Speaker 0: it came out and you got a pile of armies.

614
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,725
Speaker 1: So their turns are real quick.

615
00:40:49,786 --> 00:40:51,030
Speaker 1: Like just go go go.

616
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:53,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, you keep going until you put all your dudes on the board.

617
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,920
Speaker 0: Obviously putting your dudes on the board last means that you're have more information on your turn.

618
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:04,965
Speaker 0: So whoever puts all their dudes on the board first gets a slight advantage And in terms of tie-breaking.

619
00:41:05,526 --> 00:41:09,396
Speaker 0: and then also there are these cards that you can do that are just.

620
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:11,202
Speaker 0: there's some cards face-up next To the cell.

621
00:41:11,222 --> 00:41:13,935
Speaker 1: these cards are very similar also to the El Grande cards.

622
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:15,100
Speaker 1: They do very simple things.

623
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,642
Speaker 1: They'll be four.

624
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:16,546
Speaker 0: move two dudes on.

625
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:17,631
Speaker 0: they were already on the board.

626
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:19,620
Speaker 0: Yeah remove some dudes that are already on the board.

627
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:26,893
Speaker 1: They'll have fun names like take a prisoner or whatever, but it's literally take a dude that that's in a place That's not one of yours and move it to another place.

628
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:28,140
Speaker 1: for you have dudes, right?

629
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:28,481
Speaker 0: So these.

630
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:30,008
Speaker 0: so if you have three players, they'll be.

631
00:41:30,028 --> 00:41:31,635
Speaker 0: there's n plus one cards.

632
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:32,680
Speaker 0: face up next to the board.

633
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:32,925
Speaker 0: There's a

634
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:34,864
Speaker 1: big deck of them But you can use a number

635
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:36,410
Speaker 0: where n is the number of players and

636
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,780
Speaker 1: you never refresh them and every player can use up to one ever

637
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:41,402
Speaker 0: Right, so

638
00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:42,666
Speaker 1: and once you use it so over

639
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:47,724
Speaker 0: the course of the whole game right on one turn and one turn only you can Just say you know what?

640
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:48,066
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do.

641
00:41:48,086 --> 00:41:50,260
Speaker 0: I'm gonna use a card on this turn instead of rolling the dice.

642
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:53,200
Speaker 0: Yep, and you use a card and you do what the card says instead of the dice.

643
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:54,607
Speaker 1: No one else can ever use that card.

644
00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:56,980
Speaker 1: You can never use the card again, and that's it.

645
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,200
Speaker 0: So it's just the rest of the game.

646
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:09,260
Speaker 1: You're gonna be rolling 3d6 and choosing one of your three options and it's interesting to see like sometimes I've seen people like Make decisions based on what cards are available But they don't want to commit to taking one because then someone else could take another one.

647
00:42:09,642 --> 00:42:12,100
Speaker 1: I've seen games where everyone blows their load on their cards right away.

648
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:15,720
Speaker 0: So now here's the final thing about this game that makes it so great the twist.

649
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:22,767
Speaker 0: Everyone's finally put all their dudes on the board using this 3d6 choose to to Location one number of dudes.

650
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:25,818
Speaker 1: your mayor may not have used a card and eventually everything set.

651
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:26,440
Speaker 1: the game is over.

652
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:28,609
Speaker 0: Every player has put all their dudes on the board.

653
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,714
Speaker 0: now you start scoring.

654
00:42:29,754 --> 00:42:30,960
Speaker 0: you look at the number two spot.

655
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:33,027
Speaker 1: You score wherever that happens to be.

656
00:42:33,047 --> 00:42:35,395
Speaker 0: you start at the lowest one that you the two spot.

657
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:36,720
Speaker 0: Yeah the cheapest worthless.

658
00:42:37,162 --> 00:42:40,716
Speaker 0: It's only two victory points and you say who's got the most dudes in the two spot.

659
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:41,800
Speaker 0: It was Ram.

660
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,808
Speaker 0: He's got the most dudes in the two two points.

661
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,635
Speaker 0: whoopty rim gets the two points.

662
00:42:45,675 --> 00:43:00,669
Speaker 0: Congratulations, but Every space that is adjacent to the two spot right where rim has at least one dude already will now get reinforcements from the Concord to spot.

663
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,540
Speaker 1: Yep, general supply, right?

664
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:12,930
Speaker 1: So if I win the two and I and the two is next to say the four and the three or maybe the twelve Yep, and I have at least one army.

665
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:18,448
Speaker 0: Hey, I don't have any dudes in those adjacent spots Then you don't get any reinforcements, right?

666
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:22,400
Speaker 0: But if you do have at least one dude in the adjacent spot, you're getting in reinforcements.

667
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:33,084
Speaker 1: So you might want to win the two because it's in the like on this map I'm looking at on the screen right now The two is in the middle of an adjacent to five six and twelve has three Adjacency.

668
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:35,459
Speaker 0: so you could get a ton of reinforce and this cascade.

669
00:43:36,002 --> 00:43:38,435
Speaker 1: So if you win the time you put some armies in the three.

670
00:43:38,476 --> 00:43:39,159
Speaker 1: that's next to it.

671
00:43:39,461 --> 00:43:41,960
Speaker 1: If you win the three you keep putting armies, right?

672
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:48,631
Speaker 0: So if like let's say that the seven and the eight are both Adjacent to the twelve and you win the seven.

673
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:50,740
Speaker 0: it cascades into the eight and the twelve.

674
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:51,985
Speaker 0: You win the eight.

675
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,073
Speaker 0: it cast because you got the reinforcements from the seven.

676
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:57,348
Speaker 0: that will cascade even more Reinforcements into the twelve.

677
00:43:57,609 --> 00:43:59,700
Speaker 0: So you have at least one guy in the twelve.

678
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,784
Speaker 0: So you've got it.

679
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:06,403
Speaker 0: you had to put at least one in the twelve via dice or card at some point in the game Otherwise nothing.

680
00:44:06,664 --> 00:44:19,360
Speaker 1: so you got to keep all this in mind while you're playing and the combination of four random cards come up rolling the 3d6 every turn and The placement much like in settlers when you just randomly put the tokens out instead of following a pattern.

681
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,750
Speaker 1: That's why the game has so much replay value.

682
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,140
Speaker 1: you can't come into this with a set strategy.

683
00:44:25,481 --> 00:44:26,004
Speaker 0: You are now.

684
00:44:26,044 --> 00:44:29,860
Speaker 0: you got to play the dice that you roll and just make the optimal move each turn.

685
00:44:30,443 --> 00:44:42,336
Speaker 0: But you also need to have in order to make that optimal move You need to have the vision to see how the board will score with all these Reinforcements that do not appear at all until the end game.

686
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:42,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

687
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,985
Speaker 0: And so you got to be like, okay, you could look at the board and it looks like you're really weak somewhere He's only got one guy.

688
00:44:48,045 --> 00:44:51,557
Speaker 0: it's like they're like six reinforcements probably coming in to that spot.

689
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:54,379
Speaker 0: They're adjacent They're winning all three adjacent spots to that.

690
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:01,114
Speaker 0: Yep And you have to be able to visualize that end game cascade Every turn when you're making your decision about.

691
00:45:01,154 --> 00:45:09,159
Speaker 0: you know, I guess not in the early turns But in the late turns where it matters more You need to be able to visualize the cascade to make your decision about where to put your guys.

692
00:45:09,782 --> 00:45:13,796
Speaker 1: So the other minor mechanic that's worth mentioning is that it has a tie breaking system.

693
00:45:13,816 --> 00:45:14,760
Speaker 1: So there's never a tie.

694
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:22,060
Speaker 0: Well, like I said, whoever ends puts all their dudes on the board first therefore made their moves with less information available.

695
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,871
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had ties break towards them.

696
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,339
Speaker 0: ties break towards them.

697
00:45:25,821 --> 00:45:30,520
Speaker 0: So you're not heavily punished for and there are a lot of ties because there aren't that many dudes.

698
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there are a lot of spaces.

699
00:45:32,567 --> 00:45:39,080
Speaker 0: So you're not heavily punished for just getting all your dudes on the board quick Relative not stupidly quick, right?

700
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,358
Speaker 0: But more quickly than the other players because the other players will be able to make.

701
00:45:43,378 --> 00:45:46,279
Speaker 0: you know They're going like one here one there one there.

702
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:52,769
Speaker 0: They're getting better decisions and more optimally placing their dudes but so they shouldn't have a tie to make.

703
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,817
Speaker 0: they're doing so slowly to make up for that.

704
00:45:54,877 --> 00:46:04,252
Speaker 1: and what makes it an Inter like what makes this all very balanced is that as soon as one player is done and takes that first tie break marker No one can ever play a card again.

705
00:46:04,272 --> 00:46:05,740
Speaker 1: Yeah cards are just out of the game.

706
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,125
Speaker 0: You got to play your card before.

707
00:46:07,245 --> 00:46:13,709
Speaker 0: so when if you haven't played a card and you see somebody's running low on dudes the most Dudes anyone can put it once is three.

708
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:21,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if someone has three or less dudes Or four, you know close to three like four or five or six dudes left.

709
00:46:22,123 --> 00:46:25,340
Speaker 0: Then you might want to play a card real soon before they you know.

710
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,506
Speaker 0: Eliminate cards from an option you can use.

711
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:35,800
Speaker 1: but this game like I would say it's something that if you regularly attend conventions or play Board games like it's almost a must-buy just because it's so quick.

712
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:38,226
Speaker 0: It's also really small.

713
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:42,220

714
00:46:42,304 --> 00:46:46,560
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just a map and a bag of cubes and a little deck of cards.

716
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:52,320
Speaker 1: You could make a map out of cloth for this and then just fit the whole thing in a tiny bag.

00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:54,007
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the map is way simple.

718
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:56,880

00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,749
