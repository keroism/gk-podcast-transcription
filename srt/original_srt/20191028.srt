1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,137
Speaker 1: It's Monday, October 28th, 2019.

2
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:12,545
Speaker 1: I'm Rym, and this is Geek Nights Tonight.

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,748
Speaker 1: Microphones, like the things we're talking into right now.

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,139
Speaker 1: Podcasts.

5
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:22,088
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,165
Speaker 0: All right, so my new apartment.

7
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:28,631
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, new apartment.

8
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:32,223
Speaker 0: Directly across the street from high school.

9
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:33,005
Speaker 0: That's exciting.

10
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:34,550
Speaker 1: You can see high school sports.

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,436
Speaker 0: I can see a lot of free high school sports.

12
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:37,600
Speaker 0: High school marching bands.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,967
Speaker 0: It's not really a marching band.

14
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:41,180
Speaker 1: I mean, marching bands are really more of a Midwest thing.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,768
Speaker 0: There is a tiny amount of band.

16
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:44,840
Speaker 0: I heard some toot-toot during a football game.

17
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:48,833
Speaker 0: But yeah, there was a big crowd.

18
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:50,360
Speaker 0: They closed the road over the weekend.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,565
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

20
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:54,740
Speaker 0: And I was, and there's mobs of people out there occasionally.

21
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:56,578
Speaker 0: And it took a while to figure out what the hell was going on.

22
00:00:57,221 --> 00:01:00,856
Speaker 0: So what the hell was going on is this thing that no one outside of New York City will know about.

23
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:02,626
Speaker 1: I barely knew about it because I don't have kids.

24
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:03,290
Speaker 0: I know about it.

25
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,035
Speaker 0: It's called the SH.

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:05,409
Speaker 0: SAT.

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Speaker 0: Basically now relation to the real SAT, and other than that it is a standardized test.

28
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:11,122
Speaker 0: Yep.

29
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:18,216
Speaker 0: And what the deal is is New York City, right, you know elementary school, middle school, you sort of go to the ones near you based on where you live.

30
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least if you go into a public one.

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,503
Speaker 1: People who don't live in New York, like the way it works is if you live in a town, the town has a school, there's a school district.

32
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:31,015
Speaker 1: In a big town, the town and the school district are the same.

33
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,639
Speaker 1: In a really big town, there'll be like multiple school districts within the town.

34
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,044
Speaker 1: It's all based on like population.

36
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:39,740
Speaker 0: But anyway, New York City works differently because it's obviously a special-edge case, right?

37
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,164
Speaker 0: But the point is for high school, you got to take this fucking test.

38
00:01:43,646 --> 00:02:05,980
Speaker 0: And the test is the literally the only criteria used, that way they can say it's a meritocracy, in determining who gets to go to these special New York high schools, right, like Stuyvesant and whatever, like these special high schools that are like better and fancier, at least, you know, and according to some people, they're more prestigious and whatever.

39
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:13,200
Speaker 0: And yet somehow the, you know, the ethnic diversity of these schools ends up not being so even anyway.

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,119
Speaker 1: Yup, somehow.

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,259
Speaker 0: There's a lot of issues they're not going to go into.

42
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:16,551
Speaker 1: Yeah.

43
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:28,720
Speaker 0: But what was shocking to me is A, B, why is there this mob of people in the street and a street closing for standardized tests?

44
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,060
Speaker 1: That's what I don't get, because like I took a lot of those kinds of standardized tests and like there was there was hullabaloo, but it was always like in a building somewhere.

45
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:37,360
Speaker 1: Why aren't these parents like sitting in the gym or something?

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,560
Speaker 0: They only administer this test apparently at like a handful of locations around the city.

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,200
Speaker 1: Oh, that's fair.

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,180
Speaker 0: So people came from all the fuck over.

49
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:45,900
Speaker 1: That sounds totally fair.

50
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,700
Speaker 0: Why not administer the thing at like every high school?

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,338
Speaker 0: Well, like, look.

52
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:50,378
Speaker 0: Every high school.

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,660
Speaker 1: Here's another SAT, the PSAT, every middle school and high school just administers it.

54
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:57,667
Speaker 0: Our middle, our high school had every.

55
00:02:57,747 --> 00:02:58,952
Speaker 0: it's like everyone.

56
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,240
Speaker 0: isn't every high school in the city administering the test.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,479
Speaker 0: Why do people have to travel?

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,207
Speaker 0: Maybe that's maybe that is, you know, contributing to this problem.

59
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:13,958
Speaker 0: is that, hey, poor people can't afford to take a weekend to travel to some high school far away.

60
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:15,100
Speaker 0: with the test being administered.

61
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,239
Speaker 0: Maybe if you offered it to every single high school.

62
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:19,499
Speaker 1: Well, let's back up every single school period.

63
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,580
Speaker 1: The real problem is that for you non-American listeners, this might explain a lot about us as a country.

64
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:34,740
Speaker 1: For various, mostly racist reasons, schools are funded from the local tax base and there are federal things involved.

65
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,120
Speaker 1: But basically, if you live in a richer town, your schools just have more money.

66
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:46,820
Speaker 1: And if you live in a poorer town, your schools just have less money because they base it almost exclusively on property taxes.

67
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:49,140
Speaker 1: And that is a fucking problem.

68
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,780
Speaker 1: But in New York, it's extra special because everyone lives so close together and most people rent that they have to like figure out where to send kids.

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,360
Speaker 1: Like you can't send every kid to the school that's closest to them.

70
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,020
Speaker 0: You'll also have like buildings that have several schools in them.

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,068
Speaker 0: You'll have people scamming where they like.

72
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:05,800
Speaker 0: they find a nape because you're not too far away from a different school.

73
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,739
Speaker 1: When I was a kid in the suburbs, people did that.

74
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,159
Speaker 1: Like there was a dividing line.

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:09,701
Speaker 0: Right.

76
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:10,919
Speaker 0: But you think it's bad in the suburb.

77
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,960
Speaker 0: It's way bad in New York City.

78
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,899
Speaker 1: There was a street in Southeast Michigan near Anchor Bay where literally if you lived on one side of the street, you went to a really good school.

79
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:26,240
Speaker 1: If you lived on the other side of that street, like in this subdivision, you went to a really shitty school.

80
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:28,139
Speaker 1: And there was just no way around that.

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,220
Speaker 0: Literally, the house I grew up in was in Trumbull, Connecticut.

82
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:31,661
Speaker 0: Right.

83
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:39,320
Speaker 0: Which was a somewhat wealthy, you know, affluent, suburb town with, you know, quality schools, according to people, I guess.

84
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,740
Speaker 0: Literally, the other side of the street was Bridgeport, Connecticut.

85
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:52,020
Speaker 0: The kids who lived on the other side of the street had to go to Bridgeport High School, which is like the worst high school in like, you know, poor urban Bridgeport.

86
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:59,120
Speaker 1: Now, sometimes they were like where I grew up when I went to high school, we were in Sterling Heights, which basically had a school district for its area.

87
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:01,739
Speaker 1: And it had four high schools that are all equally good.

88
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:04,360
Speaker 1: As long as you're in that school district, all the schools were great.

89
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:09,340
Speaker 0: Anyway, point is, they only administered it in a handful of places.

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,419
Speaker 0: What the fuck is up with that?

91
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:10,900
Speaker 1: Yeah.

92
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:13,889
Speaker 0: And of course, as you were just saying, why?

93
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:17,720
Speaker 0: the fundamental problem is, why are some high schools shouldn't even be better than others?

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,560
Speaker 0: Why can't all high schools in New York City be equally good?

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:29,300
Speaker 1: Well, what I couldn't have to care which one you go to, what I could make an argument for is there should be a series of specialized high schools.

96
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:36,060
Speaker 1: They shouldn't be better, but they should be focused on a particular need, like a certain kind of special education or a certain kind of advanced program.

97
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:42,520
Speaker 1: But then there should be a fair way to make sure the kids who need that special education get to go to that specialized school.

98
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,540
Speaker 1: Well, I think you can't put that level of specialization in every high school.

99
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:54,360
Speaker 0: No, but I think, you know, what you should do if you are going to say right that, you know, some people are special and need a special thing.

100
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:58,160
Speaker 0: It's like, well, OK, the way they do it now, it's like, well, here's this high school.

101
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,878
Speaker 0: It accepts this many people every year.

102
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,280
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, what if the number of special people?

103
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,900
Speaker 1: The rule should be everyone who meets the criteria for special education, literally everyone who meets it.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,201
Speaker 0: Right.

105
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:13,940
Speaker 0: If you it's like, no, no, no, none of this bullshit where you need a test and you have enough seats is literally all these kids got straight A's.

106
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,803
Speaker 0: They're all geniuses.

107
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:18,760
Speaker 0: Then they all go to equally awesome special high school.

108
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:20,679
Speaker 0: No limit on number of seats.

109
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,407
Speaker 0: Bullshit.

110
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:21,652
Speaker 1: Yeah.

111
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:21,836
Speaker 1: Right.

112
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,540
Speaker 1: Now, take this on the national level.

113
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:39,460
Speaker 1: Like I could do to make sense where, like, if your kid is like a super genius or has a very specific type of learning disability that needs specialized help and you live in like dirtbag Pennsylvania where there's only 40 kids in the high school, then the government should make sure that your kid gets to go to a kind of school wherever it is in the country.

114
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,620
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, there's too many issues going on.

115
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:41,882
Speaker 0: Right.

116
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,920
Speaker 0: Like the kid who is a genius, but is poor.

117
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:53,380
Speaker 1: So, you know, when I recognize some specific like I went through this as a kid, my parents like threatened to sue the school because there's a Michigan law that basically said if a kid needs special education.

118
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:54,960
Speaker 1: And the district can't provide it.

119
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,520
Speaker 1: The district has to provide it via alternative means.

120
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:58,801
Speaker 0: Right.

121
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,680
Speaker 0: But how many kids, you know, they're poor.

122
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,039
Speaker 0: And maybe if that kid had been rich, they'd be genius, too.

123
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:05,498
Speaker 0: But they weren't.

124
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:05,943
Speaker 1: Yeah.

125
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:06,559
Speaker 0: It's like, come on.

126
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,699
Speaker 0: You know, now that kid can't pass this test.

127
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:10,020
Speaker 0: Not because they couldn't.

128
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,579
Speaker 0: They could have if they had been born wealthy.

129
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:19,500
Speaker 1: There were probably a lot of kids in my middle school that qualified to be like this gifted kid thing, but the school district basically didn't want to deal with that.

130
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:27,540
Speaker 1: So instead, they just sent a bus to pick me and only me up every day to take me to the high school to take high school classes and then back to the middle school to take my required middle school classes.

131
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,960
Speaker 0: Not everyone has parents who will fight and spend money.

132
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:30,364
Speaker 0: Yeah.

133
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:31,420
Speaker 1: They didn't spend any money.

134
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,220
Speaker 1: We didn't actually sue.

135
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:45,760
Speaker 0: Not everyone has parents who will send them the special, you know, training classes for this this one test you have to take and wait outside the school in the rain to get you when you finish the test to bring you back home to a far away where you live.

136
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:50,040
Speaker 1: Also, one of your kids is just like sick that day and does shit on the test because they're sick.

137
00:07:50,380 --> 00:08:00,300
Speaker 0: Well, it seemed it seemed like the test was going both days and I don't know anything about how the test is actually structured, but it felt like there was based on the flow of people.

138
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:02,999
Speaker 0: It seemed like there were several sessions per day.

139
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:07,240
Speaker 0: So I don't know if you had to sign up or you just show up for one of the sessions on either day.

140
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:08,218
Speaker 0: So you got two days.

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,460
Speaker 0: You got probably plenty of advance notice.

142
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,699
Speaker 0: You know, you got a handful of locations.

143
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:16,120
Speaker 1: Apparently, they do have a little tiny bit of accountability.

144
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:24,880
Speaker 1: You parents can get a copy of the kids answer sheet and the questions and like they can like review it and make sure, like the questions weren't wrong or something.

145
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,460
Speaker 1: There's there's some good things here, but there's a lot of bad.

146
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,061
Speaker 0: Yeah.

147
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,340
Speaker 0: Anyway, schools are weird.

148
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:34,020
Speaker 0: The street outside my house was like a shit show all weekend.

149
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:42,740
Speaker 0: And then it was crazy rain on like a mad rain on Sunday, which was kind of, you know, it was like a big umbrella sea of all these parents.

150
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,560
Speaker 0: And other people just loitering in the closed street, waiting for kids to finish a test.

151
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,279
Speaker 0: And at one point, people like kids came out and there was like clapping.

152
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,320
Speaker 0: But wow, that culture.

153
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:52,926
Speaker 0: That's bad.

154
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:53,860
Speaker 0: But here's what I don't understand.

155
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:54,840
Speaker 1: This is a high school.

156
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,340
Speaker 1: This is a test to get into high schools.

157
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:56,620
Speaker 1: Right.

158
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:56,982
Speaker 0: Yep.

159
00:08:57,684 --> 00:09:02,780
Speaker 1: Kids who are at the end of middle school should already just like why does the kid just take the subway to this thing, take the test and go home?

160
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,630
Speaker 1: Like why are the parents there?

161
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,380
Speaker 0: Where does the kid live?

162
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,859
Speaker 0: I might not live in a subway place and take the bus.

163
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:09,382
Speaker 0: Yeah.

164
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:12,920
Speaker 0: You might be bad parents who don't let your kids roam around and go all the way.

165
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:22,180
Speaker 1: I mean, at least when I had to take I took entrance exams to go to some private schools and I didn't go to any of them, partly because we couldn't afford, even though I passed the test, couldn't afford to go to those schools.

166
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,780
Speaker 1: But I couldn't drive.

167
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,608
Speaker 1: I was like 14.

168
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:25,700
Speaker 1: Some parents had to drive me to these.

169
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,900
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, you know, this, you know, I, you know, purposefully don't have children's going to deal with this bullshit.

170
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:32,519
Speaker 0: Just comment on it from afar.

171
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:37,999
Speaker 0: I feel bad for the people who did choose to have children who have to deal with the shit and didn't realize that.

172
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,400
Speaker 1: Well, I remember when my, when we moved, like as a kid, like we'd move a few times, like we just moved houses.

173
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,800
Speaker 1: Every time we move, my parents spend a shitload of time, like researching the school districts, like, oh, this house looks good.

174
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,220
Speaker 1: And then they'd spend like a week trying to figure out if the schools that that house is associated with are good or not.

175
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,700
Speaker 1: And there were a lot of really good houses we couldn't buy because they were in really bad schools.

176
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:06,280
Speaker 1: And that seems like a weird thing to have to worry about, especially in, you know, arguably the richest, best country in the world.

177
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,743
Speaker 1: Maybe.

178
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:09,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, outside my house.

179
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:10,827
Speaker 0: It was bad times.

180
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that'll happen every year.

181
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,600
Speaker 1: So there's a whole bunch of news going on.

182
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,460
Speaker 1: And the first thing I want to talk about is this feature that Netflix is reportedly testing.

183
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:20,061
Speaker 0: Right.

184
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:25,580
Speaker 0: So if you have a podcast reader, a feature I know a lot of people haven't used is make it sound like geek nights.

185
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,169
Speaker 0: Also, people do this with audiobooks.

186
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,900
Speaker 0: also is the speed up feature.

187
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,221
Speaker 0: Right.

188
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:36,960
Speaker 0: So I can understand that feature, especially for like an informational, like daily news podcast or something.

189
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,260
Speaker 1: If you care about the content, not the execution.

190
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:39,543
Speaker 0: Right.

191
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:40,880
Speaker 0: You speed up that podcast.

192
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:49,260
Speaker 0: So that way you it takes less time to ingest more information, because really, in terms of information density per time spent, nothing beats text.

193
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:49,702
Speaker 0: Right.

194
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:50,105
Speaker 0: Right.

195
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:52,400
Speaker 0: Everyone keeps producing audio and video content.

196
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:55,360
Speaker 0: If you're just interested in the information only.

197
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:55,984
Speaker 0: Right.

198
00:10:56,004 --> 00:11:00,920
Speaker 0: Like I'm watching YouTube video like how to do X. I want it to go as fast as possible.

199
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,300
Speaker 0: I'd rather have an article.

200
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,260
Speaker 0: I'm watching the video because maybe the imagery will help me because it's like a crafting or something.

201
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:08,414
Speaker 0: You get the idea.

202
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:08,719
Speaker 1: Yeah.

203
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,599
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I want text.

204
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,980
Speaker 1: I keep finding videos unless there's a technique that I don't know what I want to watch.

205
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:15,090
Speaker 0: Exactly.

206
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:15,676
Speaker 0: Perfect.

207
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:15,959
Speaker 0: Right.

208
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,720
Speaker 0: But speeding up can help there when you want content.

209
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:19,182
Speaker 0: Right.

210
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,840
Speaker 0: But, you know, for audiobooks.

211
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:22,862
Speaker 0: Right.

212
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:27,518
Speaker 0: You know, I guess it kind of makes sense to speed it up because there's two kinds of two aspects.

213
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,157
Speaker 0: The next of the audiobook.

214
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:29,340
Speaker 0: Right.

215
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:36,680
Speaker 0: And the one aspect, it's like, well, I'm using this audiobook because I can't, won't or otherwise have a reason not to read.

216
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:39,545
Speaker 0: Right.

217
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,180
Speaker 0: And, you know, I'm really just trying to get the words from the book.

218
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:48,080
Speaker 0: So the image I'm painting in my head, I just need the words to deliver the words to me, which I would have gotten if I read the book.

219
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,140
Speaker 0: But some of the image in my head, just as I would have if I was reading the book.

220
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:57,020
Speaker 1: But some audiobooks are almost like a treatment where like it has like good acting.

221
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,324
Speaker 1: Right.

222
00:11:57,507 --> 00:11:58,420
Speaker 1: Like it's a story.

223
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,840
Speaker 0: If you want to speed up an audiobook where there are like voices and acting and stuff and you speed that up, you are destroying that.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,261
Speaker 0: Yeah.

225
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:13,840
Speaker 1: Which is, you know, you're basically doing the equivalent of instead of watching a TV show, literally just reading the script to that TV show.

226
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:14,489
Speaker 0: Exactly.

227
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:15,260
Speaker 1: That's what you're doing.

228
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:15,620
Speaker 0: Right.

229
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:16,022
Speaker 0: Perfect.

230
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:22,460
Speaker 0: So Netflix is adding a feature to speed up Netflix shows.

231
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,179
Speaker 1: So I can see one use for that.

232
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:26,897
Speaker 1: Well, I can see two uses for it.

233
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,860
Speaker 1: Use number one, which I think is actually pretty good.

234
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:37,360
Speaker 1: If you're watching a documentary or a nonfiction thing, those things are so information sparse that I think the same rules apply.

235
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:42,215
Speaker 0: If you're watching like something that is any sort of show that is purely content.

236
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:44,524
Speaker 0: Right.

237
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:46,700
Speaker 0: So like a soap opera, soap opera.

238
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:48,879
Speaker 0: It's not about what you see on the screen.

239
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:52,800
Speaker 0: It's not about like, you know, it's just about knowing what happens next.

240
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,142
Speaker 0: Right.

241
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:56,640
Speaker 1: Well, so and so, so and so where the acting is good, but usually not.

242
00:12:56,841 --> 00:13:00,360
Speaker 0: Usually, I mean, it could be good, but it's that's not what it's about, even if it is good.

243
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:00,642
Speaker 0: Right.

244
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,599
Speaker 0: It's just about knowing what happens next.

245
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:04,520
Speaker 0: You guys say one piece, right?

246
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:04,842
Speaker 0: Yeah.

247
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:06,200
Speaker 0: You can speed through one piece.

248
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,072
Speaker 0: That makes sense.

249
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:07,619
Speaker 0: Right.

250
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:09,600
Speaker 0: It's got lots and lots of filler.

251
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,420
Speaker 1: People like to watch that filler because there'll be dramatic moments within it and the animation is really good.

252
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:14,802
Speaker 0: Right.

253
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:15,719
Speaker 0: But there is lots of filler.

254
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:18,239
Speaker 0: You could turn the speed on during the filler.

255
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:18,902
Speaker 0: Right.

256
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,760
Speaker 0: And it's unlike a fast forward where you wouldn't get any of the content.

257
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:24,260
Speaker 0: It's like this part.

258
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,839
Speaker 0: I just need to know what happens.

259
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:26,682
Speaker 0: Right.

260
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:27,940
Speaker 0: Because it's just filler.

261
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:29,999
Speaker 0: Here's the actual plot again.

262
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:31,520
Speaker 0: I'll watch it at normal speed.

263
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,420
Speaker 1: So this is the only other case I can see for using this, but it's specific to people like us who have to review stuff, possibly on a deadline.

264
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,380
Speaker 1: Say I have to review an anime and I haven't had time to watch one and like we were going to review the show on Wednesday.

265
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:51,060
Speaker 1: I would still watch like the first two or three episodes at normal speed because it's an audio visual media where like timing and things matter.

266
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,560
Speaker 1: I got to make sure I experience it as it was intended to be experienced.

267
00:13:55,001 --> 00:14:01,700
Speaker 1: But then I might watch three or four more episodes sped up just to get enough content to make sure like it's going in the direction I expect it to be.

268
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,528
Speaker 0: Or just like, you know, let's say I need to get.

269
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,920
Speaker 0: I need to know something about a show, but I don't actually intend to watch it.

270
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,321
Speaker 0: Right.

271
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,833
Speaker 0: Maybe, you know, it could be like a lot of times.

272
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,620
Speaker 0: it's like you could find yourself like fast forward.

273
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,800
Speaker 0: I guess we can just scrub around.

274
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,144
Speaker 1: Yeah.

275
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:18,019
Speaker 0: I don't really need that.

276
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:20,567
Speaker 0: But, you know, there might be a thing where it's like I need.

277
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:24,820
Speaker 0: I need to know about a thing, but I don't actually want to watch it.

278
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,161
Speaker 0: Yeah.

279
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:25,322
Speaker 0: Right.

280
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:28,180
Speaker 0: I'm not intending to actually consume this content.

281
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,680
Speaker 0: I just need to extract information out of it, even if it's a work of art.

282
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,740
Speaker 0: Like maybe I don't know.

283
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,161
Speaker 0: I need to.

284
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:40,600
Speaker 0: I got to remember they're Bojack Horseman, something I can probably don't care about how well-made Bojack Horseman is.

285
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,780
Speaker 1: But if we had to watch it to do something on the show and you like had to know something about it, that'd be a very good way.

286
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:48,780
Speaker 0: The problem is, is a lot of those things like IMDB just exist.

287
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:56,420
Speaker 0: But imagine if it's the olden days and I want to know like the names of the characters in Jaws or something, I could just put it on speed mode until I learned the characters names.

288
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,502
Speaker 0: I don't know.

289
00:14:57,723 --> 00:15:02,280
Speaker 1: But I feel like this is not aimed at any of the use cases we just brought.

290
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,519
Speaker 0: It is clearly not.

291
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,280
Speaker 1: I feel like I'm going to use a pejorative term here, but I feel like it's appropriate.

292
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:18,560
Speaker 1: I feel like basic people are going to watch the same crap they're watching now and just watch way more of it and binge even more and it's going to feed into those addictive watch the next episode cycles.

293
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:28,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much like I feel like this is a feature that could have good uses that is going to be abused and is going to be used to the detriment of the medium.

294
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:37,920
Speaker 1: In fact, I imagine shows for a certain demographic might even start assuming people are going to watch it at one point five X and make it that way accordingly.

295
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:39,959
Speaker 1: Maybe I could see people doing that.

296
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a whole, you know, talk to be had.

297
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,598
Speaker 0: We're not going to have about like, you know, the author's intent of the author.

298
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:52,340
Speaker 0: Do you have a right to, you know, it's your life anyway you want.

299
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,799
Speaker 0: But the way I think of it is like this.

300
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,162
Speaker 0: Right.

301
00:15:54,827 --> 00:15:56,760
Speaker 0: Some chef makes a delicious meal.

302
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:57,442
Speaker 0: Right.

303
00:15:57,462 --> 00:16:00,700
Speaker 0: You know, forget about telling the chef no onions or something like that.

304
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:01,876
Speaker 0: That's not what I'm talking about.

305
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:02,120
Speaker 0: Right.

306
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,539
Speaker 0: You know, the chef makes a delicious meal and brings it out to you.

307
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:06,286
Speaker 0: Right.

308
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:07,258
Speaker 0: For you to eat.

309
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:16,220
Speaker 0: And you lick it, you just look at all over like, like, like, like, like, like, because you're in you're consuming it the way you want to consume it and you don't bite it.

310
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,914
Speaker 1: Now, I think the right response there would be unless you are a reviewer, like doing some sort of like.

311
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,860
Speaker 1: there's some sort of other angle.

312
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:26,059
Speaker 1: The chef's response would be whatever you paid me for this.

313
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,462
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

314
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:36,740
Speaker 0: But at the same time of your preferred way of eat of, you know, buying if you prefer to buy food at a fancy restaurant.

315
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:45,647
Speaker 0: lick it like crazy and not bite it, I judge you, and I rightly judge you, as a person who is, you know, got problems.

316
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:48,643
Speaker 1: You know what this actually is a very parallel discussion to?

317
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:52,196
Speaker 1: The discussion about how EXP share in Pokemon will now be mandatory.

318
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,687
Speaker 1: It's the exact same conversation.

319
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:59,906
Speaker 0: Well, but EXP share being mandatory is good, and speeding up Netflix is bad, mostly.

320
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:14,844
Speaker 1: Well, but on one hand, if I'm going to be a true Tim Berners-Lee internet, I say the playback means, like, the thing that's playing back content or letting you interact with content can do whatever it wants with that content.

321
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:16,070
Speaker 0: Of course, technologically.

322
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,584
Speaker 1: So the Netflix, like, if I'm streaming Netflix...

323
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,196
Speaker 0: I'm just judging someone who chooses to use it in this way.

324
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:26,575
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, if you just start watching, like, entire 26 episode shows of, like, good anime...

325
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:29,875
Speaker 0: The same way that I agree, yes, you have freedom of speech to say whatever you want.

326
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,445
Speaker 0: If you say something stupid, I judge you.

327
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:32,268
Speaker 1: I'm gonna laugh at you.

328
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:32,771
Speaker 0: You know what?

329
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:37,851
Speaker 0: You have freedom if to take, to consume, to lick your steak instead of biting it.

330
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,056
Speaker 1: I judge you!

331
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:48,832
Speaker 1: You are free to watch Carole & Tuesday, a show that is literally about people making music and then performing that music in the show at 1.5x.

332
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:53,030
Speaker 1: You are welcome to do that, and I will laugh at you until the end of time.

333
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,285
Speaker 0: I will not respect you as a person of high culture.

334
00:17:56,546 --> 00:18:01,444
Speaker 1: But if you're gonna watch a History Channel documentary on Netflix, watch that at, like, 10x.

335
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:02,647
Speaker 0: Right?

336
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,669
Speaker 0: Or just don't watch it?

337
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,271
Speaker 0: Yeah.

338
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:05,734
Speaker 0: I feel like if something is not worth...

339
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:06,436
Speaker 1: I feel like you learn more.

340
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:09,947
Speaker 0: If something isn't worth watching at 1x... The way I'm gonna live my life...

341
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:10,289
Speaker 1: Yeah.

342
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:13,462
Speaker 0: If it's not worth watching at 1x, I'm just not gonna watch it.

343
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:13,824
Speaker 1: Yeah.

344
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:15,029
Speaker 1: So...

345
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,435
Speaker 0: Notice I don't watch a lot.

346
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:21,941
Speaker 1: Because, well, but all the special cases there, the caveats, are, like, if I'm editing a video of me and Scott...

347
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:22,626
Speaker 0: I have a reason.

348
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:27,571
Speaker 1: I'm gonna watch that at, like, 2 or 3x while I'm editing because I don't need to know what I said... Yeah.

349
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,058
Speaker 1: ...two days ago on a stage.

350
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:29,499
Speaker 0: Anyway.

351
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,482
Speaker 1: I probably remember that.

352
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:31,284
Speaker 0: Though sometimes I don't.

353
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,827
Speaker 0: But, yeah, this is a thing.

354
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:33,268
Speaker 1: Yeah.

355
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,180
Speaker 1: So, a lot of you, I don't want to get into all the issues around this, or Scott's money laundering scheme.

356
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,062
Speaker 0: Ah, my money laundering scheme.

357
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:40,803
Speaker 1: No.

358
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:45,428
Speaker 1: But many people are very misguided about Adobe.

359
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:54,760
Speaker 1: Like, they're mad that Adobe switched from a "buy our software and have to buy upgrades every few years" to "pay for a subscription and always have the most up-to-date

360
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,100
Speaker 1: software.".

361
00:18:55,661 --> 00:19:03,840
Speaker 1: I still say the substitution model is fine and perfect, and if that rankles you, it's because Adobe is professional software aimed at professionals.

362
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,023
Speaker 0: That's because they're people who are mad about that.

363
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:11,132
Speaker 0: They care a lot about principle, even when the reality that, you know, it's like, I actually agree.

364
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:16,220
Speaker 0: In principle, yes, the principle of paying once and just having the thing forever is better.

365
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:24,020
Speaker 0: But the reality is... But the reality, you know, is that doing it the way with a bad principle results in a better life.

366
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:25,744
Speaker 1: Here's the example.

367
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:31,577
Speaker 1: If I bought Adobe Creative Production Premium, whatever, I paid, like, over $2,000 for this.

368
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,900
Speaker 0: I bought Lightroom some version before it was subscriptionable once.

369
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,236
Speaker 1: No, I bought the Production Premium thing for, like, over $2,000 a long time ago.

370
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:40,958
Speaker 1: It was, like, CS4.

371
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:41,954
Speaker 0: Okay.

372
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:46,760
Speaker 1: I theoretically owned that, and I could still install...

373
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,558
Speaker 0: Oh, a license to it.

374
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,001
Speaker 0: Yeah.

375
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,028
Speaker 1: CS4 is fucking garbage.

376
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:54,256
Speaker 1: And if I tried to edit a project in CS4, one, it wouldn't work that well.

377
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:55,520
Speaker 1: It'd be garbage-y.

378
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,367
Speaker 1: Two, Adobe has no incentive to ever make it better because I'm not paying them anymore.

379
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:05,400
Speaker 1: There's all these reasons why, if you want software to get better, it really needs to have a subscription model.

380
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:10,495
Speaker 1: If you don't care if software gets better, that software is not something you're using in, like, a production pipeline.

381
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:11,960
Speaker 1: That's, like, a video game.

382
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:16,081
Speaker 1: I don't need a subscription to Mario 1 because I don't need any changes to Mario 1.

383
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:25,520
Speaker 0: Well, notice there's still software that's developed, so video game people are making effective subscription video games or microtransaction games so they can keep getting money and keep their jobs.

384
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,059
Speaker 1: Which they're doing primarily because...

385
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:35,920
Speaker 0: It's, like, if you want Adobe to start a giant company, make Photoshop, and then shut down after they collect all the money from selling it, then, yeah, the "pay once" model will work.

386
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:43,575
Speaker 0: The reality is, if you want it to keep getting better, and, right, it's, like, you might not need it to get better, in which case, okay, Adobe just go out of business.

387
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:46,000
Speaker 0: then after they make Photoshop just for you and no one else.

388
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,971
Speaker 1: But if you're a hobbyist, use open source stuff.

389
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:50,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sucks, but guess what?

390
00:20:50,678 --> 00:20:51,140
Speaker 1: That's what...

391
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,591
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not someone who cares about getting constantly improved stuff.

392
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:59,380
Speaker 1: You're happy using shitty stuff, so use free or low-cost stuff.

393
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,658
Speaker 1: When we couldn't afford to buy, like, Adobe shit, I used that pirated copy of Cool Edit.

394
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,164
Speaker 0: Free or low-cost stuff, and don't complain.

395
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:16,120
Speaker 0: If you want the best stuff, then it's gonna be expensive, and people are gonna need to continuously work on it all the time, which means they need to continuously be paid.

396
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:25,580
Speaker 0: So even though you're against, and I'm also against, the principle that I paid for it but now it's somehow it's gone and I can't use it anymore even though I paid, yeah, that principle sucks.

397
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:29,127
Speaker 0: But the reality is, you get the best possible software.

398
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:35,480
Speaker 0: that constantly gets better all the time, right, and is amazing, and it's more expensive, but guess what?

399
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,320
Speaker 0: If you just deal with it and pay for it, you get the most amazing softwares.

400
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,474
Speaker 1: Or if you're cheap, like on old Geek Nights, I use ReSound on Linux.

401
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:50,378
Speaker 0: You also get more of a right to complain if it isn't the best, 'cause say, "Hey, I'm fucking paying, like, 50 bucks a month for this shit, it better be fucking

402
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:50,820
Speaker 0: amazing.".

403
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:57,175
Speaker 1: So, recently there was an issue where there are sanctions against the Venezuelan government for a lot of reasons.

404
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,940
Speaker 1: Venezuela is a very troubled place right now.

405
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:01,159
Speaker 1: Many parts of the world are very troubled right now.

406
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,820
Speaker 0: The United States is a very troubled place.

407
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,540
Speaker 1: Yep, but I suggest if you haven't seen it in the news because of the hellscape we live in, check out what's going on in Chile.

408
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,630
Speaker 0: Chile, Venezuela, Lebanon, these are the troubled places.

409
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,160
Speaker 0: Hong Kong, United States, a lot of troubled places.

410
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,341
Speaker 1: Liberate Hong Kong.

411
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:32,820
Speaker 1: So, people who want to use bad old Adobe software were pointing at the fact that because there are sanctions against Venezuela, Adobe was obligated by law to cut off access to their software in Venezuela.

412
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:44,640
Speaker 1: That isn't really an argument against the economics of subscription software, that's an argument against oppressive government regimes and the ties between government and economy.

413
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,340
Speaker 0: The borders actually mattering for software.

414
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:52,547
Speaker 1: Yep, which also gets complicated because economies are different in places.

415
00:22:52,628 --> 00:23:00,240
Speaker 1: If you charge the same thing everywhere in the world, you can't make enough money to make the thing, or you can't sell to anyone except the industrialized world.

416
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:02,360
Speaker 1: There's a lot of issues, it's really complicated.

417
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:11,700
Speaker 0: The price that we pay for Adobe whatevers, in Venezuela no one could afford it, so they couldn't have it, which would be fucking them over.

418
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:15,500
Speaker 0: But if they charged the whole world the Venezuela price, they wouldn't make any fucking money.

419
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:17,826
Speaker 0: So, it's a tough thing.

420
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:21,460
Speaker 0: They don't really want to regionalize the prices, but what other choice do you have?

421
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:27,272
Speaker 1: But I don't think these people realize that if Adobe wasn't subscription software, they would still cut off Venezuela.

422
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,417
Speaker 1: You couldn't buy another license.

423
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:30,860
Speaker 1: You couldn't download it anymore.

424
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:35,600
Speaker 0: But the thing is, if you had bought it previously, they couldn't take it away from you.

425
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:47,280
Speaker 1: But if you're at the point where your government is sanctioned by the world such that it can't trade with anyone else, you should be pirating the weapons to make the memes to fight the battle.

426
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,081
Speaker 0: Exactly!

427
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:54,780
Speaker 0: If you're in a country that isn't trading with the country that makes the thing you want, then you can just fucking pirate it.

428
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:56,325
Speaker 0: Well, there's no problem.

429
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:59,015
Speaker 0: You don't agree to the other country's intellectual property laws.

430
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:00,400
Speaker 0: Just pirate like crazy.

431
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,507
Speaker 1: So, even better, you were all mad at Adobe for this.

432
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:05,191
Speaker 1: Adobe was actually pissed.

433
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:08,640
Speaker 1: Adobe did not want to stop giving software to Venezuelans.

434
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,224
Speaker 0: Of course not.

435
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:10,800
Speaker 0: They wanted to make money from the Venezuelans.

436
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,121
Speaker 1: So Adobe followed up.

437
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:28,180
Speaker 1: and now Adobe actually has, this is like a very, very breaking story, like 1030 this morning, Adobe has a specific license to bypass the sanctions and continue to let people in Venezuela use their software.

438
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:35,377
Speaker 0: Right, so at first Adobe was just going to refund everybody, but now they're like, "Okay, we'll give you a whole bunch of free months because of all the

439
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:35,778
Speaker 0: trouble.".

440
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:36,720
Speaker 0: Right?

441
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:49,740
Speaker 1: Now, this seems like the right call because selling this kind of software, like continuing to let the people of Venezuela use the software, this is the kind of software that can help them make their movement and maybe try to fix their government.

442
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,280
Speaker 0: Right, they can produce all kinds of amazing protest videos.

443
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,826
Speaker 1: And Adobe seems to have done the right thing, like they got the exemption.

444
00:24:56,906 --> 00:25:04,660
Speaker 1: Everyone did the right thing, except the Venezuelan government and most of the US government, but not all of the US government.

445
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:08,080
Speaker 1: In some other news, new AirPods are coming.

446
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,667
Speaker 0: Right, so Apple made AirPods and AirPods are garbage.

447
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:18,240
Speaker 0: Apple made headphones, the ones that are Apple branded because Apple owns Beats, I guess, and some of those are okay-ish, not the best.

448
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,200
Speaker 1: I mean, if you buy, in the old days, like you buy an iPod or an iPhone or whatever and it comes with headphones.

449
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,080
Speaker 0: I have a backup pair that I've never opened.

450
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, rule one, throw those away and buy real headphones.

451
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:33,780
Speaker 0: Right, the Apple headphones, the main problem with them has always been A, not comfortable, B, don't really fit nicely in the ear so much.

452
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,519
Speaker 0: But the biggest problem is not noise canceling or isolating in any way.

453
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:41,989
Speaker 0: So you put them in, all the outside noises still get right in your ear.

454
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:47,700
Speaker 0: You've got to turn the volume on them way up in order to hear if there's any loud noises around you and then you end up damaging your ear.

455
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:51,194
Speaker 0: If you keep it quiet and low volume so you don't damage your ear, guess what?

456
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:52,500
Speaker 0: You can't hear your music or anything.

457
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,024
Speaker 1: What's sad is this isn't new.

458
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:56,612
Speaker 1: Very few people use isolating headphones.

459
00:25:56,632 --> 00:25:57,796
Speaker 1: Like in the 70s, 80s, 90s, headphones...

460
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,799
Speaker 0: Well, those isolating and noise canceling weren't really a thing then.

461
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you could get real closed headphones but people didn't wear those in public.

462
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,619
Speaker 0: But they weren't active noise canceling.

463
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,360
Speaker 1: But people just stupidly destroy their hearing because they don't understand these basic principles.

464
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,320
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, people still don't.

465
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:22,996
Speaker 1: I was on the subway today and someone was wearing earbuds that were so loud.

466
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,760
Speaker 1: It sounded like a speaker.

467
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:31,540
Speaker 0: So I've always been buying isolating headphones from other companies but they have a host of problems.

468
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,540
Speaker 0: The etymotic ones, which are really amazing and perfect, the wire keeps breaking because it's too fragile.

469
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,760
Speaker 1: The etymotics are more like... And it's not replaceable wire.

470
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't use those on the go.

471
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:41,960
Speaker 1: Those are what you use in your home system.

472
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,744
Speaker 0: No, for many years.

473
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:46,240
Speaker 0: And I had to keep buying and warranting and all kinds of stuff because the wire kept breaking.

474
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:47,408
Speaker 1: That's why I went with Shure.

475
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:48,820
Speaker 1: Because Shure is super high quality.

476
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,669
Speaker 0: Then I tried the appley Beats ones.

477
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,620
Speaker 0: The Beats X, recommended by a listener, Luke.

478
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:58,427
Speaker 0: And those were kind of comfortable.

479
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,640
Speaker 0: They sounded a little heavy on the bass but they still sounded good enough.

480
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,620
Speaker 0: And the wireless connection to the iPhone was great because Beats is owned by Apple.

481
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,798
Speaker 0: So they connected and there's like a special Apple wireless headphone connecty thing that only Apple and Beats headphones do.

482
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:15,520
Speaker 0: that I know of.

483
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,887
Speaker 0: That made it a little more... It's still Bluetooth.

484
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:22,140
Speaker 0: It's just the connection process is a little more seamless and a little more fancy.

485
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,249
Speaker 0: And for example, you connect it to your iPhone.

486
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:25,032
Speaker 0: It's automatically.

487
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:26,620
Speaker 0: your iPad just knows about it now.

488
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:28,244
Speaker 0: It does fancy shit like that.

489
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:33,300
Speaker 0: And usually with Bluetooth, it's still... Bluetooth is still pretty seamless these days but a little bit flaky.

490
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:37,730
Speaker 0: So it's nice to have that if you are an iOS person.

491
00:27:38,452 --> 00:27:41,900
Speaker 0: So those are okay but then the battery or something on them messed up.

492
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,164
Speaker 0: I had to take them in for service.

493
00:27:43,184 --> 00:27:46,837
Speaker 0: Then I got new ones and the new ones weren't perfect.

494
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,127
Speaker 0: And I was not the most thrilled with them.

495
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:54,520
Speaker 0: And also, they were more isolating than Apple freaking earbuds.

496
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,440
Speaker 0: They were not really isolating like the etymotic ones where you hear nothing.

497
00:27:59,382 --> 00:28:07,420
Speaker 0: So I got the Shure ones similar to what RIM has and they're isolating like the etymotic ones are and the cable is replaceable.

498
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,160
Speaker 0: Which is really nice because that way I can go wired with a headphone jack or I can go Bluetooth with a separate special Bluetooth cable.

499
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,006
Speaker 0: And the earbuds presumably will never break.

500
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:17,547
Speaker 0: So that's great.

501
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:23,200
Speaker 0: The problem is that the Bluetooth cable is not... The Bluetooth is not the best.

502
00:28:24,463 --> 00:28:28,391
Speaker 0: The cable is good but I don't like to have a cable.

503
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:32,280
Speaker 0: Whether my phone has a headphone jack or not, not having a cable is nice.

504
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,149
Speaker 1: I've used expensive Bluetooth headphones, cheap Bluetooth headphones.

505
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,280
Speaker 1: Bluetooth audio works okay.

506
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,874
Speaker 0: When you're connected and it's working, it's great.

507
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,140
Speaker 0: You have wireless headphones.

508
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,420
Speaker 1: But then you'll get interference.

509
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:57,700
Speaker 0: There are certain places in the city where like I walk and the headphone goes like... Also the cable that is around from earbud to earbud with the battery and stuff on it is sort of floppy around the neck and kind of annoying.

510
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:00,649
Speaker 0: And that is the major feature of the Apple AirPod.

511
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,700
Speaker 0: It's just as shitty as every other fucking Apple headphone.

512
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:07,187
Speaker 0: But it's just two little guys.

513
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:11,980
Speaker 0: So it's like totally perfect and you don't have the stupid cable around your neck and it has perfect wireless connection.

514
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,344
Speaker 0: So that's the feature you want.

515
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,749
Speaker 0: You just need the isolating.

516
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:15,371
Speaker 0: So here we go.

517
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:16,595
Speaker 0: Rumor was true.

518
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,180
Speaker 0: Apple announces AirPods Pro.

519
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:19,484
Speaker 0: They're AirPods.

520
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:19,986
Speaker 0: Perfect.

521
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:21,070
Speaker 0: Two little white guys.

522
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,395
Speaker 0: Two little white guys.

523
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:22,736
Speaker 0: It's us.

524
00:29:23,017 --> 00:29:23,640
Speaker 0: Two little white guys.

525
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,653
Speaker 0: Perfect wireless connection but also isolation plus active noise cancelling.

526
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:29,556
Speaker 0: You shove them in your ear.

527
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:30,840
Speaker 0: The best of everything.

528
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,557
Speaker 0: The only problem with these is they're $200 something.

529
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:40,320
Speaker 1: For $250 I could get like two super professional quality IEMs.

530
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,721
Speaker 0: Right.

531
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:47,015
Speaker 0: And also just like the regular AirPods, the battery does not last forever.

532
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:49,360
Speaker 0: The battery will die in like two to three years.

533
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:51,929
Speaker 0: And you can't really replace the battery.

534
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:55,000
Speaker 0: You're just going to have to buy more AirPod Pros.

535
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,347
Speaker 0: So it's like it's bad enough to replace AirPods after two years.

536
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:03,400
Speaker 0: You're going to replace... Which are not that... They're expensive but not as expensive as AirPod Pro.

537
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:06,206
Speaker 0: You can spend $200 every... $100 a year.

538
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:07,913
Speaker 0: Over $100 a year just to have these.

539
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:09,841
Speaker 1: Yup.

540
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:14,354
Speaker 1: I've got the same IEMs that I bought seven years ago and they're fine.

541
00:30:14,394 --> 00:30:20,834
Speaker 1: And also they have a wire because I don't actually... On one hand I can see why some people really like the wireless aspect.

542
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:22,400
Speaker 0: It's really nice not having the wire.

543
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,595
Speaker 1: But on the other hand the wire has literally never been a problem and it also means that...

544
00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:26,619
Speaker 0: It's one of those things...

545
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:33,840
Speaker 1: But it means the same headphone that I plug into my phone and my Switch... You can't use these iPods with your Switch, can you?

546
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,223
Speaker 0: Probably not, no.

547
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:35,544
Speaker 0: Yeah.

548
00:30:35,765 --> 00:30:37,531
Speaker 1: So I have the same headphones one time instead of...

549
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:39,698
Speaker 0: I don't know why the Switch does not support Bluetooth audio.

550
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:40,160
Speaker 0: That's a problem.

551
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,685
Speaker 0: That's on Nintendo.

552
00:30:41,846 --> 00:30:42,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm saying...

553
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,760
Speaker 0: Because there is a Bluetooth radio in there.

554
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:52,200
Speaker 1: Because I have an Android phone, I plug the same headphones into the phone, the Switch, the tablet, and if I'm on a plane I plug it into the airplane.

555
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:52,600
Speaker 0: Yup.

556
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:59,576
Speaker 0: So... That is nice, but it's one of those things where it's like I've never had that wire.

557
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:00,458
Speaker 0: I've always had a wire.

558
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:01,260
Speaker 0: It's never been a problem.

559
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,778
Speaker 0: And then you go without the wire for a while and then if you put the wire back in you're like, "Eh, this is an annoying

560
00:31:05,818 --> 00:31:06,059
Speaker 0: wire.".

561
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,900
Speaker 1: But the wire is required for most of the things I plug headphones into, like my Switch or an airplane.

562
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:22,020
Speaker 0: The only time I have a wired headphone necessary... I don't use the audio on airplanes whenever I'm on airplanes.

563
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,784
Speaker 1: I watch movies on planes kind of often.

564
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:24,587
Speaker 0: I do not do that.

565
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:28,880
Speaker 0: I turn the screen off and do not look at that screen full of ads and garbage.

566
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:32,460
Speaker 1: But if you fly on a nice flight it's just a giant screen that you can watch real movies on.

567
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,847
Speaker 0: I do not watch those movies.

568
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:36,100
Speaker 0: So I don't have that problem.

569
00:31:36,802 --> 00:31:37,939
Speaker 1: That's how I watch your name.

570
00:31:39,185 --> 00:31:40,140
Speaker 0: I watch it in a theater.

571
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:45,119
Speaker 1: I also watch it in a theater, but I watched it early because I was on a JL flight and they just showed it.

572
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:51,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only time I plug headphones in with a wire is my home desktop because my headphones are wired.

573
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,869
Speaker 0: I plug them into the top of the computer at work.

574
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:54,780
Speaker 0: I have Bluetooth connected to the laptop.

575
00:31:55,281 --> 00:32:00,315
Speaker 1: So last news that I just want to point out.

576
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:16,140
Speaker 1: I'm not going to go into all the details about this story, but this is one of a huge number of examples where basically there's a hospital algorithm or the set of algorithms that's used to determine, given a bunch of people, who to prioritize treatment for, like triage type stuff.

577
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,820
Speaker 1: If there's ten people and you have four doctors...

578
00:32:20,382 --> 00:32:22,000
Speaker 0: Who's in the waiting room and who's going to the doctor?

579
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:29,246
Speaker 1: If you spend your resources on someone who's not likely to make it versus someone who's likely to make it with treatment, what do you do?

580
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:31,239
Speaker 1: These are really hard questions to answer.

581
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:39,260
Speaker 0: Right, but with a shit ton of medical data, even anonymized data, it should be theoretically possible to make better decisions on this than a human would.

582
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,023
Speaker 0: You have a fuck ton of data.

583
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:48,379
Speaker 0: The doctor can't just know, "Oh yeah, someone who has these symptoms...".

584
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,720
Speaker 0: It's like the doctor can't even diagnose the person until they're in the room and they're looking at them.

585
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:58,116
Speaker 0: But the computer could maybe be like, "Alright, we've got symptoms and that's all we've

586
00:32:58,136 --> 00:32:58,377
Speaker 0: got.".

587
00:32:59,321 --> 00:33:01,871
Speaker 0: "Alright, well that person is bleeding all over the place.

588
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:03,859
Speaker 0: This person may be broken on...".

589
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:22,560
Speaker 1: So the problem is, for a lot of reasons that you can guess at these reasons, talk to an old person or read a book if you're unclear on this, but the data that we're going to use to feed these algorithms and these AI systems is already really racist and biased,

590
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,724
Speaker 0: because the data

591
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:26,620
Speaker 1: is collected from a pretty racist and biased society.

592
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,500
Speaker 1: So imagine an algorithm that decides whether or not someone you're about to hire for a job is trustworthy.

593
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:41,260
Speaker 1: That algorithm is going to be based on the data sets collected by people who have been hiring up to this point, which there is a history of racist, biased hiring.

594
00:33:41,843 --> 00:33:45,360
Speaker 1: Therefore, you're just going to train the computer to be as racist as society.

595
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:53,800
Speaker 0: Well, what you could do is you could have that old data, right, and then instead of telling it, "Hey computer, do like we did in the past...".

596
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,519
Speaker 1: "Hey computer, find the biases and fix

597
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:55,600
Speaker 1: it.".

598
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,090
Speaker 0: Well, you could be like, "Computer, in the past we fucked the fuck up.

599
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:02,499
Speaker 0: You make decisions, not according to this

600
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:02,640
Speaker 0: data.".

601
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,516
Speaker 0: You know, you have this data, use it, but don't do it this way.

602
00:34:07,576 --> 00:34:08,699
Speaker 0: that the old data did it.

603
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,239
Speaker 0: But that's hard to do.

604
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:13,976
Speaker 0: Of course, but look at that old data and don't do it that way.

605
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:14,860
Speaker 0: Do it a different way.

606
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,188
Speaker 0: Optimize for this other thing.

607
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,739
Speaker 0: Don't optimize for this, right?

608
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,143
Speaker 0: But people don't do that.

609
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:22,618
Speaker 0: They just write a real simple program that's like, "Pick who's most likely to

610
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:23,080
Speaker 0: survive.".

611
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,920
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, when doctors were racist, black people didn't survive.

612
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:30,239
Speaker 0: So you're going to keep telling the doctors to treat white people.

613
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,560
Speaker 0: Because you're not doing it because they're white, you're doing it because they're more likely to survive.

614
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Speaker 0: Because in the past, they were more likely to survive in racist land.

615
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:45,420
Speaker 1: The provenance of your data and the way it was collected is very important if you're using it for any real AI application.

616
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:55,550
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

617
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,236
Speaker 1: So I just saw this tweet come by.

618
00:34:57,256 --> 00:35:00,310
Speaker 1: Apparently there's the Helvetica font, which is an okay font.

619
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:05,130
Speaker 1: But there are many things that are called Helvetica.

620
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:10,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just like an obvious, the most softball, easy joke that anyone could think of.

621
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,830
Speaker 0: So it's so bleh that it's not even funny.

622
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,818
Speaker 1: There's like a band called Helvetica.

623
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:17,870
Speaker 1: I've seen like ten different fonts called Helvetica.

624
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:18,974
Speaker 1: They're just shitty in some way.

625
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:23,230
Speaker 1: But they're always like either satanic or like rooty.

626
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,636
Speaker 1: Like they're always something like that.

627
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:27,469
Speaker 1: I found the true Helvetica.

628
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:32,447
Speaker 1: It is identical to regular Helvetica except the kerning is broken.

629
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:33,030
Speaker 1: That's it.

630
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,979
Speaker 1: It's just bad kerning Helvetica.

631
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,728
Speaker 1: And it's really funny to look at.

632
00:35:37,332 --> 00:35:38,550
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't think it's that funny.

633
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,369
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty funny.

634
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:39,686
Speaker 1: Okay.

635
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:40,906
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

636
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:46,190
Speaker 0: So in China, right, there was a mafia boss.

637
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:47,069
Speaker 0: All right.

638
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:55,208
Speaker 0: And the mafia boss hired a hitman and said, "Kill my rival mafia boss hitman and I will give you many

639
00:35:55,308 --> 00:35:55,689
Speaker 0: monies.".

640
00:35:56,735 --> 00:35:59,130
Speaker 1: He's only going to pay him $282,000.

641
00:35:59,130 --> 00:35:59,768
Speaker 0: That's a lot of monies.

642
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:00,550
Speaker 1: Depends.

643
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,632
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah.

644
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:04,566
Speaker 0: But anyway, I feel like for a hitman.

645
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:05,108
Speaker 0: that's one hit.

646
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:08,322
Speaker 1: If you only got to work a week a year to make $282,000 a year, okay.

647
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:11,371
Speaker 1: Tax-free.

648
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,538
Speaker 1: You're not paying taxes on that.

649
00:36:12,558 --> 00:36:14,449
Speaker 1: At least I hope not.

650
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,041
Speaker 0: Anyway.

651
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:19,059
Speaker 1: IRS, what do you do?

652
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,089
Speaker 0: I am a hitman.

653
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,597
Speaker 0: This hitman figures, "You know what?

654
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,689
Speaker 0: I want this money, but I don't really want to kill this other mafia

655
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:28,970
Speaker 0: boss.".

656
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,054
Speaker 0: That's A, hard.

657
00:36:30,295 --> 00:36:31,119
Speaker 0: B, dangerous.

658
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,590
Speaker 0: C, it's clear why you would not want to do that.

659
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,266
Speaker 0: But it's also clear why you would want to not tell the first mafia boss, "No, thank you.

660
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:38,968
Speaker 0: I'm not going to do

661
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:39,089
Speaker 0: it.".

662
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:39,771
Speaker 0: Right?

663
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:43,209
Speaker 0: You want to say, "Yes, I'll do it," and somehow get away with not doing it.

664
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,519
Speaker 1: Yeah.

665
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,770
Speaker 0: So, genius hitman hires another hitman.

666
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:51,249
Speaker 1: Subcontracted hitman.

667
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,104
Speaker 0: So, the thing about it, you're getting what?

668
00:36:54,104 --> 00:36:54,426
Speaker 0: $282,000 something?

669
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,690
Speaker 0: So let's just say $300,000.

670
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,456
Speaker 1: Oh, he split it in half.

671
00:36:57,577 --> 00:36:57,980
Speaker 1: I'll keep $141,000.

672
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,350
Speaker 1: I'll give you $141,000.

673
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,630
Speaker 0: The other guy doesn't even know he's getting it split in half.

674
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,941
Speaker 0: He's just like, "Look, I'll give you $140,000 to kill this mafia

675
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:05,202
Speaker 0: boss.".

676
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:07,592
Speaker 0: $140,000.

677
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,190
Speaker 1: Still a pretty good salary for a year.

678
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:10,896
Speaker 0: All right.

679
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:11,442
Speaker 0: All right.

680
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:12,050
Speaker 0: Right?

681
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:22,748
Speaker 0: And that guy, he's thinking, "Hey, I could hire someone else to do this hit and pay them like

682
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:24,371
Speaker 0: $70,000.".

683
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:31,458
Speaker 0: And this exact thing not only is a hilarious story that would make for a great movie, it's a real story that really happened.

684
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:35,190
Speaker 0: It got all the way down to the fifth hitman.

685
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,470
Speaker 1: But the fifth hitman had such a good idea.

686
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:42,470
Speaker 0: Was smarter, yet also dumber than all the other hitmen.

687
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:49,110
Speaker 0: The fifth hitman went to the victim, the person who had the hit, the rival mafia boss.

688
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,230
Speaker 1: Because he's not making that much money at this point anyway.

689
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:51,470
Speaker 0: Right.

690
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,294
Speaker 0: He's not getting paid enough.

691
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,242
Speaker 0: And he's saying, "Look, bro.

692
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:56,089
Speaker 0: Somebody paid me to kill

693
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:56,230
Speaker 0: you.".

694
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:59,810
Speaker 0: And this person doesn't even know who the original hit person was.

695
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,769
Speaker 0: He can't even rat out the original mafia boss to the rival guy.

696
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:09,002
Speaker 0: But he can say, "Look, fake your death.

697
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:14,737
Speaker 0: You fake your death and I'll get money from this fourth hitman, who I don't even know is the fourth hitman.

698
00:38:16,164 --> 00:38:17,509
Speaker 0: And then we'll split that money.

699
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,365
Speaker 0: Just fake your death so we both get

700
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:20,587
Speaker 0: money.".

701
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,175
Speaker 1: You know, good on him.

702
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:26,170
Speaker 1: He's the only one who didn't take an action that would lead to another person's death.

703
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,678
Speaker 1: So, I don't know how...

704
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:32,070
Speaker 0: I assume China's justice system is not that just.

705
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,856
Speaker 0: I mean, ours isn't that just.

706
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:36,750
Speaker 0: I assume China's is possibly less just.

707
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:43,790
Speaker 0: But regardless, there's a photo of the courtroom with all of the hitmen lined up.

708
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,250
Speaker 0: And apparently there was more news since I read the story.

709
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,527
Speaker 1: They all look mad and sad, except this guy who seems like, "Eh, you got

710
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:50,648
Speaker 1: me.".

711
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,876
Speaker 0: Right.

712
00:38:53,157 --> 00:38:56,890
Speaker 0: So, Rym apparently read more details on the story, I guess, that are more recent.

713
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:58,530
Speaker 0: Oh, so there's even further updates.

714
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:03,170
Speaker 0: Some of the hitmen got off because I guess the last guy technically didn't commit a crime.

715
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:03,987
Speaker 0: All he did was...

716
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,150
Speaker 1: Well, he committed a crime, but he didn't commit attempted murder.

717
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:07,129
Speaker 0: Oh, that's true.

718
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:08,399
Speaker 1: But it gets more complicated.

719
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,690
Speaker 1: I found even yet more updates.

720
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,249
Speaker 0: He didn't hire a hitman, which is illegal.

721
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,880
Speaker 1: I guess the first trial had some problems.

722
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,482
Speaker 1: They did it again.

723
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,370
Speaker 1: Eventually, they all went to jail.

724
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:17,013
Speaker 0: Okay.

725
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:21,170
Speaker 0: Regardless, that is a hilarious story that someone's going to make a movie out of.

726
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,108
Speaker 1: But some people were like, "No, this would be the best Guy Ritchie

727
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:24,389
Speaker 1: movie.".

728
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:25,689
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

729
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,710
Speaker 0: It just is a Guy Ritchie movie.

730
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:32,450
Speaker 0: Are you sure it isn't like a Guy Ritchie faked his news story so that he could then make a movie?

731
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,389
Speaker 0: No, Guy Ritchie hired the original mob boss to put the hit out.

732
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:40,429
Speaker 0: He's like, "Look, I know five cowardly

733
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:40,570
Speaker 0: hitmen.".

734
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,768
Speaker 0: You have to hire this guy and they all know each other.

735
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,116
Speaker 1: I would just call the movie.

736
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:46,810
Speaker 1: The movie would literally be called Five Cowardly Hitmen.

737
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:47,326
Speaker 0: I don't know.

738
00:39:49,235 --> 00:39:50,129
Speaker 0: This is such a great story.

739
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,970
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is still the Tale of Genji.

740
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,736
Speaker 1: It's going to be a while.

741
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:56,169
Speaker 1: We're going to pick an inner rim book.

742
00:39:56,592 --> 00:39:56,741
Speaker 1: Alright.

743
00:39:57,491 --> 00:39:58,039
Speaker 1: I got to pick it.

744
00:39:58,141 --> 00:39:58,405
Speaker 1: Stay tuned.

745
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,346
Speaker 0: Or we could do several episodes on Tale of Genji.

746
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:03,270
Speaker 0: There's another I. And just do piece by piece.

747
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,029
Speaker 1: Like chapters.

748
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:04,930
Speaker 1: Yeah.

749
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,250
Speaker 1: Good chapter by chapter, maybe.

750
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:07,189
Speaker 0: That's too many.

751
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:08,689
Speaker 1: How many chapters are there?

752
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:08,961
Speaker 1: A lot.

753
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:10,149
Speaker 1: It's like the tea set thing.

754
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,329
Speaker 1: But the incense thing.

755
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,789
Speaker 0: It's big.

756
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,250
Speaker 1: Yeah.

757
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:13,970
Speaker 1: Anyway, we'll do it at some interval.

758
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,310
Speaker 1: We'll say how far we got.

759
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,966
Speaker 1: We'll be like, "Hey, we're going to do a book club on the first

760
00:40:17,006 --> 00:40:17,168
Speaker 1: bit.".

761
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:17,666
Speaker 0: Anyway.

762
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,969
Speaker 1: Because then we can speculate on what's going to happen next.

763
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:20,504
Speaker 0: We'll see.

764
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

765
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:28,070
Speaker 1: We're going to be live at PEX Unplugged doing... I'll post the schedule when I get a chance.

766
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,848
Speaker 1: We're doing one talk.

767
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,410
Speaker 1: A brand new talk called Take Your Fucking Turn.

768
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:33,069
Speaker 0: Hell yeah.

769
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,450
Speaker 1: And we're going to do another talk that is two hours long.

770
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:39,450
Speaker 1: We're going to teach you how to play and play with you three different board games.

771
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,590
Speaker 1: All in the same room.

772
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,010
Speaker 1: One, two, three.

773
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,750
Speaker 0: Are we sure we're going to be able to do that in the allotted time?

774
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,590
Speaker 1: Definitely with the games we're doing.

775
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,050
Speaker 1: Plus, we'll do Wizard last.

776
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,470
Speaker 1: Because Wizard can stop after any number of hands because people will have gotten the gist.

777
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,230
Speaker 1: So I think we're good there.

778
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,430
Speaker 0: It'd be kind of lame if it stopped after the first or second hand.

779
00:40:55,531 --> 00:40:56,750
Speaker 1: I feel like we could get further in.

780
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,869
Speaker 1: These games are not hard to teach.

781
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,610
Speaker 1: I think Genshin Clever might take the longest, but we can move it along.

782
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,749
Speaker 0: What else do we got?

783
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:08,549
Speaker 1: PAX East, PAX Unplugged, PAX West, PAX Fest, PAX East.

784
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:10,070
Speaker 1: All this is coming.

785
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:12,029
Speaker 1: Let's get into it.

786
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,210
Speaker 1: Talk about microphones.

787
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:21,610
Speaker 0: So we got to avoid doing what is a high crime worse than hiring a hitman, which is doing a podcast about podcasting.

788
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:22,007
Speaker 0: Yup.

789
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,746
Speaker 0: That is a crime.

790
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,210
Speaker 1: I feel like there's a podcast now.

791
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:27,224
Speaker 0: Enough of those were made, you know, 14, 15 years ago.

792
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:31,710
Speaker 0: No more shall ever be made, especially not by two white dudes.

793
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:39,028
Speaker 1: Though what I would say that is kind of fascinating is everything that tells people how to make podcasts tends to be full of terrible goddamn advice.

794
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:39,990
Speaker 1: that makes bad podcasts.

795
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,410
Speaker 0: The only advice you need to start is to just talk.

796
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:42,930
Speaker 1: Content is king.

797
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,630
Speaker 0: Talk into a microphone, make an MP3 and upload at the end.

798
00:41:45,811 --> 00:41:46,490
Speaker 0: Content is king.

799
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:47,429
Speaker 0: So, microphones.

800
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,770
Speaker 0: The number one rule is you must not use a microphone as your logo if you are a podcast.

801
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,570
Speaker 0: Unless your podcast is about microphones.

802
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,590
Speaker 0: Our podcast is about nerdy things, therefore our logo should have nerdy things in it.

803
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,670
Speaker 1: I feel like the only reason.

804
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,650
Speaker 0: Podcast about soccer shouldn't have a microphone in it, it should have a soccer ball.

805
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:08,610
Speaker 1: You might have noticed we changed our logo and we're currently rebranding because it's kind of bridging from the meta moment into the main bit.

806
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:17,330
Speaker 1: But I feel like the only reason our logo, the old logo with the microphone gets a pass is that there were like 12 podcasts when we started.

807
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,369
Speaker 1: Like there weren't that many podcasts.

808
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,870
Speaker 0: Anyway, so we're going to talk only about microphones, right?

809
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,050
Speaker 0: The things you talk into and the hardware and the types and such and such.

810
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:35,290
Speaker 1: Because I've realized in my life that most people know fuck all about microphones even though they use them all the time.

811
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,310
Speaker 0: They don't know how to use them.

812
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:43,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, like people will use microphones that are designed to work no matter how stupid you are in incredibly stupid ways.

813
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,290
Speaker 1: And I see people, like speakers, they do the same thing.

814
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:56,170
Speaker 1: You'll see people who have the PC volume set all the way down but then their amplifier, like the external one is set to the max volume and all sorts of just terrible ideas.

815
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,587
Speaker 0: So what was the first ever microphone?

816
00:42:59,310 --> 00:42:59,692
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.

817
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:00,336
Speaker 1: That history?

818
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:02,087
Speaker 1: That was probably that liquid microphone.

819
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:02,529
Speaker 1: Let's see.

820
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:06,330
Speaker 1: In order to speak, the first microphone ever was a megaphone.

821
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:07,216
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

822
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:07,560
Speaker 0: That's true.

823
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:09,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, well.

824
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:10,795
Speaker 1: You know what?

825
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:12,809
Speaker 0: I actually don't know how the fucking megaphone works.

826
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:13,353
Speaker 1: Really?

827
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:14,289
Speaker 1: You really don't?

828
00:43:15,575 --> 00:43:16,349
Speaker 0: It's just a big horn.

829
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:19,270
Speaker 1: A megaphone or a microphone?

830
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,210
Speaker 0: Like a megaphone.

831
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:21,243
Speaker 1: Resonance.

832
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:22,587
Speaker 0: Oh, is that it?

833
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,903
Speaker 0: Acoustic amplification.

834
00:43:23,963 --> 00:43:24,510
Speaker 1: It's a whole thing.

835
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:25,152
Speaker 1: Alright.

836
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:29,430
Speaker 0: But like if I can talk into a big horn, like a Viking, and just be loud.

837
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,288
Speaker 0: But a megaphone is a lot smaller and has a battery in it.

838
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,230
Speaker 1: So megaphones used to not have batteries or electronics.

839
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:39,830
Speaker 0: Okay.

840
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,035
Speaker 0: I understand how a horn works.

841
00:43:42,377 --> 00:43:45,410
Speaker 0: But how does like a modern megaphone that I would buy at like the sporting goods store.

842
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,822
Speaker 1: I want to give you a second to not feel dumb about this.

843
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:49,390
Speaker 1: Because it's really simple.

844
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:50,109
Speaker 0: How does it work?

845
00:43:51,153 --> 00:43:53,450
Speaker 1: The point you're talking to is a microphone.

846
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,230
Speaker 1: And there's a speaker on the other side.

847
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:56,810
Speaker 0: With an amp.

848
00:43:57,072 --> 00:43:57,810
Speaker 0: And then a horn.

849
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:58,346
Speaker 0: That's it.

850
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,041
Speaker 0: And a horn.

851
00:43:59,205 --> 00:43:59,348
Speaker 0: Okay.

852
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:07,770
Speaker 1: The horn part coming out is just an acoustic amplifier in addition to the electric amplifier inside of the thing.

853
00:44:08,472 --> 00:44:13,350
Speaker 0: So you're just using a smaller horn with a powered amplifier so that you don't need a big horn.

854
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,329
Speaker 1: That's literally all it is.

855
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:15,094
Speaker 0: Okay.

856
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:15,679
Speaker 0: That's boring.

857
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:16,769
Speaker 0: I thought there was something in there.

858
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:21,230
Speaker 1: I owned one of those megaphones for a while, but I got rid of it because that was a real waste of time.

859
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,262
Speaker 1: I was going to bring it to Connecticut.

860
00:44:23,282 --> 00:44:23,990
Speaker 1: It'd be real annoying.

861
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,470
Speaker 0: They're mostly used on like, you know, these days for like not much.

862
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:28,388
Speaker 1: There's cops.

863
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:29,790
Speaker 0: People just use PA systems.

864
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:33,870
Speaker 1: There's cops in Grand Central every day using them to yell at people to not go up the downstairs.

865
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,468
Speaker 0: I see them mostly use like boats to yell at other boats.

866
00:44:36,962 --> 00:44:37,005
Speaker 0: No.

867
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,220
Speaker 0: Who have like a radio.

868
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,110
Speaker 0: They're just really close.

869
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,979
Speaker 1: So let's talk about first things first.

870
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,369
Speaker 1: What does a microphone do?

871
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:50,850
Speaker 1: Because there's microphones are actually both electrically and mechanically very, very simple devices on the surface.

872
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:56,490
Speaker 1: And the details only matter if you are doing things a little more complicated than just talking on a phone.

873
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,722
Speaker 0: So the idea is that someone's talking, right?

874
00:44:58,883 --> 00:45:00,070
Speaker 0: Or you're making noise.

875
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,329
Speaker 1: Sound is happening.

876
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,063
Speaker 0: You want to capture that noise in an electrical form.

877
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:07,170
Speaker 0: You want to turn noise into electricity, right?

878
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:10,003
Speaker 1: And then from electricity, turn it into something else later.

879
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:11,350
Speaker 1: We don't care what you turn it into.

880
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:15,703
Speaker 0: Well, it just so happens, we're very lucky that noise is an analog signal.

881
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:17,327
Speaker 0: It is waves in the air.

882
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,170
Speaker 0: Sound waves.

883
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:18,948
Speaker 1: Vibrations.

884
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:19,753
Speaker 0: Vibrations.

885
00:45:19,793 --> 00:45:20,859
Speaker 0: The air is shaking.

886
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,690
Speaker 0: If there's no air, you can't make any sound, right?

887
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:24,883
Speaker 0: Or you need something to vibrate, even if it's not air.

888
00:45:24,903 --> 00:45:26,110
Speaker 0: You need some sort of medium.

889
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:26,727
Speaker 0: But regardless.

890
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,374
Speaker 1: And we won't just talk about air.

891
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:32,090
Speaker 1: I've had microphones that are not designed to detect air.

892
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,373
Speaker 1: Yeah.

893
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:38,930
Speaker 0: But most of the time with humans talking or noise making with instruments, it's air that's vibrating.

894
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:40,154
Speaker 0: You want to capture it.

895
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:42,762
Speaker 0: You want to detect how the air is vibrating.

896
00:45:42,802 --> 00:45:45,530
Speaker 0: What frequency, what amplitude, right?

897
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,625
Speaker 0: And then you want to sort of record that with electricity.

898
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:49,469
Speaker 0: It just so happens we're lucky.

899
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,957
Speaker 1: Well, it didn't actually have to be electricity.

900
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,270
Speaker 1: There are completely mechanical microphones.

901
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:54,147
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are.

902
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:56,470
Speaker 0: That have... But most of the time it's electricity.

903
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:04,330
Speaker 1: Well, but there are microphones that will detect the vibrating air and stencil it directly into something like a wax cylinder or a record.

904
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:04,889
Speaker 0: That's cool.

905
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, that can exist because it's not even turned into electricity.

906
00:46:08,053 --> 00:46:08,654
Speaker 1: It's just.

907
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:15,040
Speaker 1: Can you record vibration and store a record of that vibration somewhere?

908
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:24,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, we've heard about like archaeologists, like taking old pottery and like dragging needles on it because the vibrations of people talking way, way, way, way back.

909
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,129
Speaker 1: Theoretically be captured there.

910
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,230
Speaker 0: Theoretically had been just been captured because the movements of the air hitting the pottery while it was being made.

911
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:36,810
Speaker 0: So you heard what the maybe the noises that were being made when the pottery was being made.

912
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,151
Speaker 1: Yeah.

913
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,008
Speaker 1: In practice, it seemed like that didn't work out.

914
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,190
Speaker 0: Regardless.

915
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:41,929
Speaker 1: It's a good idea, but it didn't work out.

916
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:42,231
Speaker 1: Right.

917
00:46:42,573 --> 00:46:45,090
Speaker 0: You just need to capture the vibration.

918
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:50,270
Speaker 0: So what you do is you have some sort of thing that is so light.

919
00:46:51,012 --> 00:46:51,335
Speaker 0: Right.

920
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:52,750
Speaker 0: That it will vibrate.

921
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,470
Speaker 1: Or so big, like it just has to, it has to react.

922
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:57,344
Speaker 0: The air, the air will push it.

923
00:46:58,029 --> 00:46:58,210
Speaker 0: Right.

924
00:46:58,751 --> 00:47:01,689
Speaker 0: And then modern times you put a fucking magnet on there.

925
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:04,530
Speaker 1: Well, actually, that already gets complicated.

926
00:47:05,732 --> 00:47:06,356
Speaker 1: But think of it this way.

927
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,730
Speaker 1: Really, all the microphone is a transducer in the end.

928
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:16,770
Speaker 1: All it's doing is converting one form of energy to another form of energy, taking vibration and turning it into something else, some kind of signal.

929
00:47:17,592 --> 00:47:19,570
Speaker 1: So really, that's just a transducer.

930
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,010
Speaker 1: There's a lot of ways to make transducers to detect vibrations.

931
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:30,410
Speaker 1: I'm going to not really talk about all the historic kinds of microphones because they're just so obsolete.

932
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:31,613
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

933
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:36,210
Speaker 1: Unless you're a nerd who really is interested in this stuff, it is not helpful information.

934
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:42,150
Speaker 1: But basically, modern microphones are either condenser microphones, electrodes, which are actually condensers.

935
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:44,662
Speaker 1: They're just a different kind of condenser.

936
00:47:44,682 --> 00:47:45,790
Speaker 1: The details are kind of nuanced.

937
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,930
Speaker 1: Carbon microphones, which are known as cheap as shit, piece of shit microphones.

938
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:53,429
Speaker 1: There's dynamic mics, which are what a lot of microphones are.

939
00:47:54,170 --> 00:48:00,730
Speaker 1: And then there's kind of crazy, like the more specialized stuff like contact microphones and RF microphones.

940
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,882
Speaker 1: And then the really crazy stuff like laser microphones.

941
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,650
Speaker 1: Don't really need to talk about those that much either.

942
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:13,350
Speaker 1: But in terms of you, any microphone and any device you have that's like a phone is probably just an electric condenser.

943
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:19,130
Speaker 1: Fancy microphones tend to be either dynamic or condenser.

944
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,879
Speaker 1: The fancier microphones tend to be condenser.

945
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,450
Speaker 1: But yeah, it doesn't really matter for most people.

946
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:34,370
Speaker 1: Condenser microphones really aren't better unless signal quality matters a lot to you and other factors we can get into.

947
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:40,730
Speaker 1: But the way these all basically work, like to talk about all the differences, a dynamic microphone is pretty easy.

948
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,429
Speaker 1: It's basically the magnet thing, like Scott said.

949
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:49,430
Speaker 1: Have some sort of diaphragm, have some magnetic stuff and just calculate air velocity rather like and use that.

950
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:53,510
Speaker 0: When the magnets move in relation to each other and metal, right, there is a current.

951
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:57,390
Speaker 0: It's a really weak current because it's kind of, you know, it's not like a giant magnet.

952
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:57,792
Speaker 0: Right.

953
00:48:58,033 --> 00:49:01,710
Speaker 0: But that weak current is enough, you know, and it's analog.

954
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:11,050
Speaker 0: So the vibrate, the movement of the magnet, the change in voltage in the wire is going to mirror the vibration of the air because the air moving is what's pushing the magnet.

955
00:49:11,411 --> 00:49:20,730
Speaker 0: The signal comes out, you amplify the signal with a preamp or just an amp and now you record that in whatever recording medium of choice.

956
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,468
Speaker 0: It could be like a tape or a record.

957
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,594
Speaker 0: Let's talk about that.

958
00:49:24,634 --> 00:49:28,930
Speaker 1: This gets into audio stuff that's going to be on microphones, but there's like mic level and line level.

959
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:35,550
Speaker 1: And if you have something that's just playing music, it's playing like at line level, meaning like it is loud enough.

960
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:42,830
Speaker 1: There's a signal that is loud enough to do stuff with, but microphones make extremely weak signals.

961
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:43,932
Speaker 1: Yep.

962
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:46,479
Speaker 0: Think about how small a microphone is.

963
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:50,630
Speaker 0: There's little magnets in there and they're so weak ass that the air.

964
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:51,996
Speaker 1: Well, it's actually a magnetic coil.

965
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:52,839
Speaker 1: It's an electromagnet.

966
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:55,430
Speaker 1: There's no like a permanent magnet in there.

967
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,235
Speaker 1: The point is dynamic microphone.

968
00:49:57,295 --> 00:50:02,130
Speaker 0: The point is they're light enough that air is physically pushing them around.

969
00:50:02,772 --> 00:50:03,094
Speaker 0: Right.

970
00:50:03,456 --> 00:50:04,862
Speaker 0: They're moving when I talk.

971
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:06,409
Speaker 0: My voice is shaking them.

972
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:08,820
Speaker 0: And that shaking is making a voltage.

973
00:50:09,282 --> 00:50:11,050
Speaker 0: that's obviously not making a big voltage.

974
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,649
Speaker 0: If it was making a big voltage, we could have power plants just by taking people like us who talk too much.

975
00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:16,528
Speaker 1: Which we could.

976
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,410
Speaker 0: We could make a power plant where people like us just talk at a wall and generate electricity.

977
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:22,552
Speaker 0: Right.

978
00:50:22,934 --> 00:50:24,139
Speaker 0: If microphones were better.

979
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,550
Speaker 0: But no, the voltage that comes out is weak ass.

980
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:38,570
Speaker 1: So whenever you hear an audio person on a preamplifier or a mic amplifier, that's just an amplifier that takes the weak ass signal from the microphone and gets it up to line level.

981
00:50:38,892 --> 00:50:41,810
Speaker 1: So it's on the same level as something that is like a normal signal.

982
00:50:42,811 --> 00:50:49,450
Speaker 1: And then on the other side, if you're playing stuff out of a speaker, you usually have an amplifier to drive that speaker to make it as loud as you want it to be.

983
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:54,390
Speaker 1: Because usually you want a speaker like in a stadium to be really loud compared to my voice.

984
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:55,848
Speaker 0: I want the speaker to be louder than me.

985
00:50:56,131 --> 00:50:56,272
Speaker 0: Right.

986
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:58,730
Speaker 0: Because even a signal that's at line level, right?

987
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:05,710
Speaker 0: If I got like a normal tiny speaker or some headphones, line level's probably enough to shake the speakers in the headphones.

988
00:51:05,852 --> 00:51:06,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, tiny little speaker.

989
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:15,010
Speaker 0: If I'm in a stadium or I'm a DJ and I got a giant speaker, I need some, I can't, it might take a line level signal and send it to the speaker.

990
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,050
Speaker 0: That ain't shaking shit.

991
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:16,357
Speaker 0: Yup.

992
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:16,833
Speaker 0: Right?

993
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:17,461
Speaker 0: It's not shaking.

994
00:51:17,502 --> 00:51:17,968
Speaker 0: no booties.

995
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,450
Speaker 0: You gotta get big amps and a big stack, right?

996
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,928
Speaker 0: Power that shit up and then you go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

997
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:24,411
Speaker 0: Right?

998
00:51:24,753 --> 00:51:25,737
Speaker 0: You need big electricity.

999
00:51:25,777 --> 00:51:28,830
Speaker 0: Because the speaker, usually speakers aren't powered.

1000
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,771
Speaker 0: Right?

1001
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,821
Speaker 0: They don't have their own battery.

1002
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:31,810
Speaker 0: They don't plug into the wall.

1003
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,809
Speaker 0: They just have speaker wire going into them and all the amplification happens somewhere else.

1004
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,250
Speaker 1: Yup.

1005
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:42,828
Speaker 1: So dynamic mics are like basic, like a microphone you see on a stage is probably an SM58.

1006
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:50,628
Speaker 0: The metal like mesh ball on a thing you hold, that's what that is.

1007
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:51,531
Speaker 1: Yup.

1008
00:51:52,092 --> 00:51:59,788
Speaker 1: So dynamic mics, a lot of people who are podcasting or something or doing anything, they feel like, "Oh, but I need a condenser because they're much more expensive.

1009
00:51:59,808 --> 00:52:00,209
Speaker 1: They must be

1010
00:52:00,229 --> 00:52:00,450
Speaker 1: better.".

1011
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:00,618
Speaker 1: Meh.

1012
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:01,973
Speaker 1: And they are better.

1013
00:52:02,013 --> 00:52:03,096
Speaker 1: We use condensers now.

1014
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:03,959
Speaker 1: We used to not.

1015
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:07,670
Speaker 1: But dynamic mics actually have a lot of benefits.

1016
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,590
Speaker 1: One, the difference in quality probably does not matter to you or most people.

1017
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,729
Speaker 0: You probably would never notice.

1018
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:23,550
Speaker 1: Two, dynamic mics are better in situations where the volume, like the actual objective volume of the sound could get crazy loud.

1019
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,969
Speaker 1: Dynamic mics basically can't get blown out.

1020
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,797
Speaker 1: They're just invincible and their gain before feedback is really high.

1021
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:38,570
Speaker 1: so they can take in a crazy high signal, meaning you wouldn't even need to pre-amplify it that much before they start to fuck up.

1022
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:45,790
Speaker 1: I'm skipping a lot of details because they're not that relevant, but that's basically that normal microphones on like a stage are dynamic microphones.

1023
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:50,036
Speaker 1: Condenser microphones are the so-called fancy ones.

1024
00:52:50,638 --> 00:52:51,620
Speaker 1: They're a little different.

1025
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,243
Speaker 1: They use a capacitor.

1026
00:52:53,744 --> 00:52:55,848
Speaker 1: You want to know why they're called condenser microphones?

1027
00:52:56,369 --> 00:52:56,810
Speaker 1: Do you know why?

1028
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,724
Speaker 0: It's not condensation from the air.

1029
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:00,229
Speaker 0: Why?

1030
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,442
Speaker 1: Capacitors were originally called condensers.

1031
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:04,265
Speaker 1: That's all.

1032
00:53:04,505 --> 00:53:05,750
Speaker 1: They're just capacitor microphones.

1033
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:16,670
Speaker 1: So instead of like a coil and a thing moving, which may or may not be a permanent magnet depending on the kind of microphone, like dynamic, there's all different ways to do this, then that'll make the signal.

1034
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,614
Speaker 1: Condensers are much more sensitive.

1035
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:25,110
Speaker 1: It's basically tiny elements moving and changing the capacitance of those elements.

1036
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:26,330
Speaker 0: Ah, mmm.

1037
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:26,907
Speaker 1: That's how they work.

1038
00:53:28,012 --> 00:53:30,090
Speaker 1: That means you need a power source.

1039
00:53:30,491 --> 00:53:32,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, otherwise that capacitor just drains right out.

1040
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,530
Speaker 1: Yep, dynamic mic sort of powers itself.

1041
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,838
Speaker 0: Yeah, because like I said, there's magnets, right?

1042
00:53:37,878 --> 00:53:40,550
Speaker 0: Magnets moving just makes electricity, right?

1043
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:48,868
Speaker 0: The same way that if you crank, if you take a motor and turn it with your hands, right, voltage will come out the other end, and then if you put voltage in, then the motor will spin.

1044
00:53:48,888 --> 00:53:49,990
Speaker 0: It works in both directions.

1045
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,174
Speaker 0: This is the same thing, right?

1046
00:53:52,234 --> 00:53:54,598
Speaker 0: Moving the magnets makes electricity, right?

1047
00:53:54,918 --> 00:54:01,970
Speaker 0: Making electricity moves the magnets, but if there are no magnets, you're going to need power to fill up the capacitor because it will just drain on its own.

1048
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,350
Speaker 0: So there's a thing called the phantom.

1049
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:05,698
Speaker 1: Phantom power.

1050
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:07,310
Speaker 1: If you see that phantom power button.

1051
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,708
Speaker 0: Grab the key and fucking run.

1052
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:10,389
Speaker 0: That's right.

1053
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:23,264
Speaker 1: All that means is that the thing you're plugging the microphone into is sending some voltage out, like it's sending electricity to the microphone, so the microphone can basically power itself.

1054
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:27,630
Speaker 1: There's some nuance to what that power is used for that I really don't want to get into.

1055
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:32,970
Speaker 0: The point is, if you have a microphone that needs the phantom power, because it has a capacitor in it.

1056
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,690
Speaker 1: Meaning it's a condenser microphone.

1057
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,409
Speaker 0: And you do not have phantom power, the microphone will not work, right?

1058
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,947
Speaker 1: It'll either generate no signal, or...

1059
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:44,630
Speaker 0: It'll be so weak, maybe there's some energy left in the capacitor, who knows?

1060
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:51,250
Speaker 1: Or depending on the kind of condenser microphone, it's theoretically possible it might generate a signal that's just so small, nothing could detect it.

1061
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,690
Speaker 0: It also might get weaker over time if you start using it, because the capacitor will drain.

1062
00:54:55,050 --> 00:55:01,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's complicated too, because usually condenser microphones use that voltage both to power themselves and to polarize one of their elements.

1063
00:55:02,471 --> 00:55:12,190
Speaker 0: Regardless, the point is, if you do want to plug it in, you need to find something to plug it into that will give it the phantom power.

1064
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:24,310
Speaker 1: And this is why most people would prefer to use the dynamic microphone, because unless you're doing really professional stuff, I don't think you want to have to have the equipment that can send phantom power to your device.

1065
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:32,190
Speaker 0: Right, you can just take a dynamic microphone, if you've got the right cables, you can shove it in the back of your computer, you can shove it into your iPhone, you can shove it into anything, you've got a microphone hole.

1066
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:37,510
Speaker 0: If you've got the right cables and adapters to plug into the bottom of the microphone, you can connect the dynamic microphone.

1067
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,729
Speaker 0: It's gonna work, you're gonna talk, the audio's gonna come out.

1068
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:48,550
Speaker 0: If you've got the condenser microphone, you need to find some kind of device, some audio mixer, amp, something that has phantom power.

1069
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:55,629
Speaker 0: I have a thing at home, it's made by Shure, it's called the X2U, literally stands for XLR to USB.

1070
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:09,590
Speaker 0: On one side, it's a little tiny guy, it's just like a little rod, on one side is an XLR connector to connect the microphone, on the other side is USB, the big kind of USB that you use for your printer and stuff.

1071
00:56:10,472 --> 00:56:15,542
Speaker 0: And then, in the middle, there's just some volume knobs, there's actually a little headphone hole.

1072
00:56:15,563 --> 00:56:19,110
Speaker 0: so you can monitor the microphone on its own separately from your computer.

1073
00:56:20,231 --> 00:56:29,688
Speaker 0: But regardless, it takes the USB power, and with a little button, you can say, "Hey, I'm using a condenser mic, take the USB power and use it as phantom power and power the

1074
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:30,189
Speaker 0: microphone.".

1075
00:56:30,652 --> 00:56:30,738
Speaker 1: Yep.

1076
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:36,390
Speaker 0: I think that's the smallest, cheapest thing I know of that you can use to get phantom power.

1077
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:42,210
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't understand phantom power, and a lot of people buy microphones that they can't use because they don't understand this.

1078
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:45,990
Speaker 0: It comes down to your microphone either needs it or it doesn't, and if it needs it, it needs it.

1079
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:52,650
Speaker 1: Now, modern microphones, if you put phantom power down the line, but it's actually a dynamic mic, usually it won't break anything.

1080
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:53,733
Speaker 0: Yeah, you won't even notice.

1081
00:56:54,114 --> 00:56:59,169
Speaker 0: I've had it happen before, it's like, "Yeah, this microphone doesn't need phantom power, but it's on, oh well, you won't even

1082
00:56:59,209 --> 00:56:59,350
Speaker 0: know.".

1083
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:04,850
Speaker 1: That is not true for another type of microphone, the ribbon microphone, which thankfully is just so obsolete, like it doesn't matter anymore.

1084
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:09,750
Speaker 0: That's the old timey radio ones, you see, that no one uses anymore unless they're weird and retro.

1085
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:25,430
Speaker 1: The history of microphones is basically that different technologies came at different times, but some of the technologies, while they were better in many ways, were not easy to produce, or worked, but were shitty, like one we'll get to in a second, the one that's actually in all your phones, like that kind of microphone.

1086
00:57:25,831 --> 00:57:35,730
Speaker 1: So ribbon microphones have a little, tiny, tiny, thin ribbon of metal inside of them, and that's the thing that detects the signal, and they have a whole system around them.

1087
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:37,298
Speaker 0: It sounds like

1088
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:37,946
Speaker 0: "wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.".

1089
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:45,426
Speaker 1: Actually, in the olden times, a ribbon microphone was super good compared to all the other types of microphones they could make.

1090
00:57:45,887 --> 00:57:47,030
Speaker 1: It was like the high quality one.

1091
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,656
Speaker 0: But now it sounds like old timey.

1092
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:52,910
Speaker 0: It wasn't just the recording technology that makes it sound old timey, it was also the microphone.

1093
00:57:53,110 --> 00:58:01,590
Speaker 1: But the problem with ribbon microphones is that that piece of metal is way bigger than you think, and is crazy fragile.

1094
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,789
Speaker 0: Well, because it has to be so weak that air moves it.

1095
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:14,945
Speaker 1: Even worse, if you turn on phantom power to an old ribbon microphone, it'll also instantly destroy the very expensive microphone.

1096
00:58:15,586 --> 00:58:18,370
Speaker 1: A too loud sound can ruin a ribbon microphone.

1097
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:21,326
Speaker 1: Yelling to one that's not designed for yelling?

1098
00:58:21,346 --> 00:58:22,050
Speaker 1: You've just broken it.

1099
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,942
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just shake that little piece of metal right off.

1100
00:58:24,506 --> 00:58:24,929
Speaker 0: The end.

1101
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:28,337
Speaker 1: So, there's a subset of condenser microphones.

1102
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:33,090
Speaker 1: Most people don't seem to realize these are condenser microphones, but they're called electrets.

1103
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,881
Speaker 1: They're basically a condenser microphone.

1104
00:58:36,901 --> 00:58:37,966
Speaker 1: They were invented in the '60s.

1105
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:38,710
Speaker 1: They're pretty new.

1106
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:47,430
Speaker 1: And they used to be really shitty, because they were very low quality, but over time, the technology got better and better to where this is the kind of microphone that's in everything today.

1107
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:57,770
Speaker 1: Anything that isn't like a studio mic, anything in a phone, in a portable console, if you have a smartwatch that has a microphone in it, it's almost definitely an electret.

1108
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:02,882
Speaker 1: They're basically just condensers where the polarization is like.

1109
00:59:02,902 --> 00:59:05,730
Speaker 1: they have a pre-permanently polarized thing in there.

1110
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:08,276
Speaker 1: Like an electrically charged ferroelectric material.

1111
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:09,860
Speaker 1: You can read Wikipedia.

1112
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,610
Speaker 1: I don't even understand it that well, because I don't give a shit about electret microphones.

1113
00:59:14,433 --> 00:59:18,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, they're not... Electret microphones are not usually used for sounding great, right?

1114
00:59:19,552 --> 00:59:21,305
Speaker 1: They're used because they're tiny.

1115
00:59:21,385 --> 00:59:21,970
Speaker 0: Tiny and cheap.

1116
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,057
Speaker 0: Tiny, efficient, cheap, right?

1117
00:59:24,117 --> 00:59:24,559
Speaker 0: They work.

1118
00:59:25,764 --> 00:59:26,306
Speaker 0: Durable.

1119
00:59:26,747 --> 00:59:27,370
Speaker 0: Don't think about it.

1120
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,973
Speaker 0: They're relatively low.

1121
00:59:29,073 --> 00:59:35,005
Speaker 1: quality is kind of why you can't record anything with good audio on your phone.

1122
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:37,610
Speaker 1: As much as you might think you can, you really can't.

1123
00:59:39,491 --> 00:59:41,516
Speaker 1: All those other kinds of microphones are really obsolete.

1124
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:47,410
Speaker 1: Most people, when they think about kinds of microphones, it actually comes down to the idea of the pickup pattern.

1125
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,935
Speaker 1: Like, how does the microphone pick up sound?

1126
00:59:49,975 --> 00:59:55,350
Speaker 1: Because if you weren't aware of this, you can design microphones that basically only pick up sound from one direction.

1127
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,810
Speaker 0: Well, the pickup pattern isn't always directly related to the type, right?

1128
00:59:59,252 --> 01:00:00,250
Speaker 0: It's completely unrelated.

1129
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:05,550
Speaker 0: You can have different condensers with different patterns, different dynamics with different patterns, a dynamic and a condenser with the same pattern.

1130
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,275
Speaker 0: So you can have like a shotgun microphone.

1131
01:00:08,295 --> 01:00:14,810
Speaker 0: You think about you put it on your camera because you're walking around town with your camera interviewing people for the local TV station.

1132
01:00:15,172 --> 01:00:16,076
Speaker 0: So you have a shotgun mic.

1133
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:18,610
Speaker 0: It's a long stick and you aim it straight at people.

1134
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,843
Speaker 1: If you're watching the stream, I'm holding mine up.

1135
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:21,730
Speaker 1: It's like a foot long.

1136
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:30,210
Speaker 0: Right, you aim it at people because you want to hear them talking and you don't want to hear anyone else talking like the crazy hobo who's trying to yell because he sees the news people recording something.

1137
01:00:30,832 --> 01:00:33,860
Speaker 0: You aim it and it picks up that person right in front of you along.

1138
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:34,863
Speaker 0: It's like a long stick.

1139
01:00:35,184 --> 01:00:35,404
Speaker 0: It's like.

1140
01:00:35,545 --> 01:00:36,607
Speaker 0: that's why it's called a shotgun.

1141
01:00:36,628 --> 01:00:37,390
Speaker 0: It kind of makes sense.

1142
01:00:38,231 --> 01:00:41,744
Speaker 0: And you could have a dynamic shotgun or condenser shotgun or I don't know.

1143
01:00:42,045 --> 01:00:42,266
Speaker 0: Right.

1144
01:00:42,648 --> 01:00:43,230
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

1145
01:00:43,771 --> 01:00:43,971
Speaker 0: It's the.

1146
01:00:43,991 --> 01:00:48,239
Speaker 0: it's where it's the shape of the microphone and the shape of where does it?

1147
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:53,490
Speaker 0: a part capsule that you part of it that you aim and then how far away does it pick up.

1148
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:59,288
Speaker 0: It's like a three dimensional shape that comes out of the microphone and it's like any noise in that zone.

1149
01:00:59,308 --> 01:00:59,890
Speaker 0: Right.

1150
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:08,790
Speaker 0: That is moving in this direction will be picked up by the microphone and air moving outside that zone will not hit the microphone and will not be heard and recorded.

1151
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:21,390
Speaker 1: Now, if you're curious how this works, because this is purely physical, this is using physics and the shape of the thing around the actual microphone element to block sound from a direction.

1152
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:21,771
Speaker 1: Right.

1153
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,717
Speaker 1: So that isn't even that complicated.

1154
01:01:23,757 --> 01:01:23,897
Speaker 0: Right.

1155
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:25,381
Speaker 0: Like it is a microphone I'm using right here.

1156
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:28,370
Speaker 0: If I try to talk into it from the side, you just disappear.

1157
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:28,770
Speaker 1: Right.

1158
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:30,892
Speaker 0: It's like you can probably still hear me, but probably not much.

1159
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:38,678
Speaker 1: And if I come around to the frame all the way around to the back, like 180 degrees more so than if you were back here.

1160
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,368
Speaker 1: And the reason for that is because we're these microphones are Beta 87 A's.

1161
01:01:45,388 --> 01:01:46,109
Speaker 1: They're condensers.

1162
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:51,540
Speaker 1: They're sure, but they're hypercardioids, which is a tight type of pickup pattern.

1163
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:54,143
Speaker 1: But the math basically comes down to interference patterns.

1164
01:01:54,203 --> 01:02:06,620
Speaker 1: So like, you know, if I play a sound and then I play the inverse of that sound, like the exact same sound, but I invert the phase, meaning like if it's a sine wave going up and down and up, like up, down, up, down.

1165
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:08,806
Speaker 1: And I play the exact same sound, but I flip it over.

1166
01:02:08,846 --> 01:02:09,769
Speaker 1: So it's down, up, down, up.

1167
01:02:10,953 --> 01:02:13,380
Speaker 1: Sound waves interfere with each other in the real world.

1168
01:02:13,681 --> 01:02:19,720
Speaker 1: So if two sound waves that are the exact opposite are happening at the same time, they cancel each other out and you hear nothing.

1169
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:20,142
Speaker 1: Right.

1170
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:24,140
Speaker 0: It's like if I'm pulling the tug of war to the right, you pull left, the rope doesn't move.

1171
01:02:24,362 --> 01:02:25,520
Speaker 1: But there are still forces.

1172
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:35,100
Speaker 0: If I shake the air with a wave and you shake the air with the exact opposite wave, then when that part of the pool where the waves in the water meet is a still water.

1173
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:35,480
Speaker 1: Yep.

1174
01:02:35,981 --> 01:02:40,771
Speaker 1: So active sound cancellation, like in fancy headphones, that's what they're doing.

1175
01:02:40,812 --> 01:02:42,134
Speaker 1: It's generating sound.

1176
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:44,840
Speaker 1: That's the inverted phase of the background noise.

1177
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:51,440
Speaker 0: Intentionally looking at the waves coming in the pool and intentionally making the opposite wave to force there to be still water.

1178
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,386
Speaker 1: Yep.

1179
01:02:52,406 --> 01:02:53,520
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

1180
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:54,100
Speaker 0: Right.

1181
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:02,920
Speaker 0: Imagine if like you could, you know, it's like you could never do it with your hand, but like splashing the water in the pool so fastly and precisely to force the water to be still.

1182
01:03:03,148 --> 01:03:03,359
Speaker 1: Yep.

1183
01:03:03,865 --> 01:03:04,538
Speaker 0: That's what's going on.

1184
01:03:04,801 --> 01:03:07,899
Speaker 1: So the shape of the microphone determines this.

1185
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:12,640
Speaker 1: And even though I understand them, this is one area of math, I actually do understand it pretty well.

1186
01:03:13,162 --> 01:03:15,160
Speaker 1: Without drawing it, it's really hard to explain this.

1187
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,740
Speaker 0: It's also three dimensional and all the illustrations everywhere will always be two dimensional.

1188
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:21,860
Speaker 0: Maybe a YouTube video could show you some 3D explanations.

1189
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,400
Speaker 1: But a lot of people get confused about when and how to use these different patterns.

1190
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,025
Speaker 1: And this is something generally.

1191
01:03:28,246 --> 01:03:31,940
Speaker 1: there's two kinds of microphones, directional or omni-directional.

1192
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,417
Speaker 1: An omni-microphone means it picks up sound equally in all directions.

1193
01:03:35,497 --> 01:03:35,980
Speaker 1: It just works.

1194
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:42,940
Speaker 1: Any time you do something to make a microphone more directional, you also color the sound.

1195
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:46,614
Speaker 1: You're changing the signal that's coming in because you're fucking with it.

1196
01:03:46,654 --> 01:03:48,080
Speaker 1: Like you're making the audio go through all these paths.

1197
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,078
Speaker 1: You're canceling things out.

1198
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:54,180
Speaker 1: So if a microphone is omni-directional, it'll pick up sound from all directions.

1199
01:03:54,663 --> 01:03:57,000
Speaker 1: But sometimes, in fact, most times you want that.

1200
01:03:57,381 --> 01:04:05,700
Speaker 1: If you can get away with it, you always want to use an omni-directional microphone because you'll get the purest possible representation of the actual sound at that point in space.

1201
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:16,880
Speaker 1: So an omni-directional microphone that's closer to the sound source will be better than a directional microphone that's further away from the same source.

1202
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,180
Speaker 0: The problem with omni-directional is sometimes you're recording sounds.

1203
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:26,180
Speaker 0: And like I said with shotgun microphone, you don't want to record every sound that hits that point in space.

1204
01:04:26,301 --> 01:04:27,968
Speaker 0: It's like we've got two people talking.

1205
01:04:28,028 --> 01:04:30,720
Speaker 0: We don't want to record anything else except the two people talking.

1206
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:33,920
Speaker 0: We don't want the birds tweeting and the grass blowing.

1207
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:40,700
Speaker 1: This room we're recording nights because I only have two bedrooms is not a full sound stage.

1208
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,072
Speaker 1: I don't have acoustic foam covering every surface.

1209
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:44,500
Speaker 1: There's a lot of echo in this room.

1210
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,317
Speaker 0: There could be noises coming from outside like the 7 train.

1211
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:46,981
Speaker 1: Yep.

1212
01:04:47,001 --> 01:04:48,409
Speaker 1: Scott and I are also very loud.

1213
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:50,239
Speaker 1: We're just yelling into microphones for an hour.

1214
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,272
Speaker 1: And I need to make sure his mic doesn't pick me up and vice versa.

1215
01:04:53,594 --> 01:04:54,800
Speaker 1: so these hyper-cardioids...

1216
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:55,739
Speaker 0: They're not in separate rooms.

1217
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,660
Speaker 1: The pickup pattern on these is very specific.

1218
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:03,110
Speaker 1: And if you buy fancy microphones with directional patterns, they come with a template.

1219
01:05:03,311 --> 01:05:07,100
Speaker 1: you can put over the microphone to figure out where to put other sound sources.

1220
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:15,380
Speaker 1: Because the sound they pick up the least is like 270 degree angle and the inverse of that out the back.

1221
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:24,160
Speaker 1: Because on a stage you stand on the X and you put the monitor speakers pointed at you so you can hear your band and yourself pointed at the microphone from those angles.

1222
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:30,320
Speaker 1: So the microphone will pick you up and it'll pick the crowd up a tiny bit but it won't pick up those two specific speakers.

1223
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:33,270
Speaker 1: Like that's how cool this shit can get.

1224
01:05:34,093 --> 01:05:35,740
Speaker 1: But it colors the sound.

1225
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,767
Speaker 1: So you know how people talk about a radio voice?

1226
01:05:38,631 --> 01:05:40,480
Speaker 1: That's caused by that pickup pattern.

1227
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:45,460
Speaker 1: The closer you get to a microphone that is directional, the more you'll pick up bass.

1228
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,470
Speaker 1: Like bass gets physically amplified.

1229
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:51,180
Speaker 1: My voice will get deeper the closer I get to this thing.

1230
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:54,199
Speaker 0: Also you intentionally talk deeper just then.

1231
01:05:55,264 --> 01:05:56,080
Speaker 1: That was not intentional.

1232
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:57,340
Speaker 0: You did it though.

1233
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,840
Speaker 1: Even if I talk really high though it'll still be deeper than if I do it back here.

1234
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:01,420
Speaker 0: That's true.

1235
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:08,940
Speaker 1: So radio people, depending on what you're doing, maybe you want to get someone's natural voice.

1236
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,809
Speaker 1: Then you want to use an omnidirectional mic.

1237
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:12,580
Speaker 1: Maybe you want to sound like Barry Manilow.

1238
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:16,378
Speaker 1: You get a fucking shotgun mic and you like swallow it and talk into it.

1239
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:26,080
Speaker 1: So shotgun mics are just really really really really directional microphones.

1240
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:43,699
Speaker 1: That long length and all those vents on the side is just to pick up reflections and route audio around to where sound that comes in from the sides, well not from the direct sides but from like any sound you don't want to pick up, is generally going to be reflected internally such that it cancels itself out.

1241
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:48,840
Speaker 1: So because of math and physics you can't actually do that for all sounds.

1242
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,960
Speaker 1: So the pickup patterns are actually way more complex than these images I'm showing you because they also are different at every frequency.

1243
01:06:56,581 --> 01:07:01,040
Speaker 1: So that's the complication and this is the stuff you have to learn if you use microphones for serious.

1244
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:08,920
Speaker 0: Right well because you might have, you know, if you're doing some audio stuff where it matters, you got a whole set of microphones with all sorts of different ones, you get to pick the right one for the right job.

1245
01:07:09,964 --> 01:07:13,680
Speaker 0: But you know you're making a movie or something or recording a band, it's like you got to know that stuff.

1246
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:17,640
Speaker 0: But if you're 99% of people using microphones are just talking.

1247
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:24,799
Speaker 1: And in that case you just want to be as close to that microphone as you can and that's fine.

1248
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:29,260
Speaker 1: And then set your gain like the volume so you're not overloading the thing.

1249
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:36,840
Speaker 0: Yeah I think most people are just using, you know, the ones in their headset or the ones in their phone.

1250
01:07:37,422 --> 01:07:42,100
Speaker 1: I have never found a headset that had a microphone that was even like worth talking about.

1251
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,799
Speaker 0: They're so bad.

1252
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:44,760
Speaker 0: Right the strategy.

1253
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:52,679
Speaker 1: When I play like Overwatch if I wear this just because that's what I'm talking to like the team with, I'll record my voice with a different microphone if I'm streaming for the rest of you.

1254
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,900
Speaker 0: This is my recommendation.

1255
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,540
Speaker 0: You know they sell gaming headsets and stuff like that to people.

1256
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,980
Speaker 0: They're pretty much all a bad idea.

1257
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,320
Speaker 1: You're better off buying headphones and a microphone.

1258
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:05,980
Speaker 0: Yes if you go online and be like what's the best gaming headset?

1259
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:12,140
Speaker 0: Pretty much everyone who knows anything says buy headphones because you can get really good headphones really cheap.

1260
01:08:12,662 --> 01:08:13,708
Speaker 0: And then buy a microphone.

1261
01:08:13,728 --> 01:08:15,540
Speaker 0: you can get a pretty good microphone pretty cheap.

1262
01:08:16,121 --> 01:08:21,020
Speaker 0: And that's cheaper than a gaming headset which is shitty headphones attached to a shitty microphone and a bunch of gaming garbage.

1263
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:28,580
Speaker 0: The only time you should buy like a headset that has the microphone and the ear thing is like let's say you're a salesperson who's on the phone all day.

1264
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,160
Speaker 0: Then it's like well the audio quality doesn't really matter.

1265
01:08:31,381 --> 01:08:34,060
Speaker 0: The hands-freeness is what matters right?

1266
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,020
Speaker 0: You know then the not hassle of having two things is what matters.

1267
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:39,479
Speaker 0: Other than that headsets no bueno.

1268
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,279
Speaker 1: So volume wise I think we're not gonna get too deep in this.

1269
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:45,102
Speaker 1: We've gone long enough.

1270
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:51,740
Speaker 1: but in terms of what you do with the audio the last thing we should talk about is dynamic mics.

1271
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:52,725
Speaker 1: You generally don't like.

1272
01:08:52,745 --> 01:08:55,140
Speaker 1: you don't get so loud that the microphone distorts you.

1273
01:08:55,801 --> 01:09:03,680
Speaker 1: Usually it's the thing you're putting the signal into does not have the ability to capture the signal that you're putting into it.

1274
01:09:04,423 --> 01:09:05,839
Speaker 1: That's what clipping is.

1275
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:07,383
Speaker 1: We live in a digital world.

1276
01:09:07,783 --> 01:09:14,660
Speaker 1: analog clipping exists but it turns into a different kind of distortion that sucks but doesn't suck as much as digital distortion.

1277
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:15,444
Speaker 0: And we're not a metal band.

1278
01:09:15,465 --> 01:09:17,939
Speaker 0: we're not going for intentional distortion right?

1279
01:09:18,261 --> 01:09:23,540
Speaker 1: But basically however whatever microphone you're using whatever thing you're putting that signal into.

1280
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:30,819
Speaker 1: You want to make sure that the loudest sound you intend to put into it will not go above whatever red line your software has.

1281
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:35,000
Speaker 1: Because that is clipping and that's where literally the signal will not be processed.

1282
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:41,200
Speaker 1: If you record something and look at it in some software you'll see these like flat tops on the waves.

1283
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,546
Speaker 0: Right you think about a wave right?

1284
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:44,700
Speaker 0: The air is moving when I'm talking right?

1285
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:45,582
Speaker 0: It's a wave.

1286
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:51,140
Speaker 0: it's nice and you know regardless of what frequencies are in the wave it is you know up and down.

1287
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,399
Speaker 0: It has you know an amplitude.

1288
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,260
Speaker 1: But there's no maximum volume.

1289
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,040
Speaker 0: No I could get louder and louder and louder and louder until your eardrums break.

1290
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,887
Speaker 0: You might not be able to hear all the sounds.

1291
01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:03,119
Speaker 0: maybe a dog can hear more of them but they're there.

1292
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:06,325
Speaker 1: In air there is an upper limit.

1293
01:10:06,586 --> 01:10:10,694
Speaker 1: there you could have a sound so loud that it causes nuclear fusion.

1294
01:10:14,165 --> 01:10:14,569
Speaker 0: That's true too.

1295
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:15,700
Speaker 0: That could theoretically happen.

1296
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,160
Speaker 0: You could also just blast all the air away so there's no air left.

1297
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,840
Speaker 1: Yep you get one big sound and then nothing.

1298
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:28,960
Speaker 0: Right but regardless of those ideas right there's not a lot of limit to how much and you know to what frequencies and how hard and fast.

1299
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,097
Speaker 0: I guess the air molecule can't move faster than the speed of light.

1300
01:10:32,117 --> 01:10:32,640
Speaker 0: that's your limit.

1301
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:40,500
Speaker 1: So if you're recording to a physical medium like a record you can only stick the needle so deep into the vinyl before you go through it.

1302
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:49,540
Speaker 1: Yep and if you make your tolerances such that the loudest sound you could possibly record on earth will go as deep as you can go.

1303
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,880
Speaker 1: Then most of the sounds you're going to record will be so quiet they won't even scratch the record.

1304
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,487
Speaker 0: Right and if you have a computer recording the noise digitally you know you can only have it.

1305
01:10:58,507 --> 01:11:02,153
Speaker 0: you know it's like how often am I going to write down onto this data?

1306
01:11:02,413 --> 01:11:06,239
Speaker 0: right with bits zeros and ones the amplitude at a given point in time?

1307
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:06,580
Speaker 0: right.

1308
01:11:06,941 --> 01:11:10,774
Speaker 1: The frequency is how often and the number of bits is how much?

1309
01:11:11,095 --> 01:11:12,580
Speaker 1: how many gradations can you store.

1310
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:13,181
Speaker 0: Right it's only.

1311
01:11:13,221 --> 01:11:14,062
Speaker 0: it's like just same things.

1312
01:11:14,082 --> 01:11:15,344
Speaker 0: look at a high resolution image.

1313
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:17,188
Speaker 0: it's like I can use 64 bits.

1314
01:11:17,548 --> 01:11:20,794
Speaker 0: I can write down a thousand bits.

1315
01:11:20,794 --> 01:11:24,200
Speaker 0: 20,000 billion bits per microsecond right is a limit.

1316
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,162
Speaker 0: And that number of bits it's like.

1317
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:28,386
Speaker 0: well that's how many amplitudes I can represent.

1318
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:30,750
Speaker 0: if there's a sound that's even louder.

1319
01:11:31,011 --> 01:11:33,194
Speaker 0: where I'm already I already wrote down all ones.

1320
01:11:33,575 --> 01:11:36,700
Speaker 0: all ones is my loudest possible highest possible amplitude.

1321
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,320
Speaker 0: So what happens if a louder sound comes in than all ones?

1322
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,562
Speaker 0: A louder sound appears.

1323
01:11:40,923 --> 01:11:46,273
Speaker 0: all I can do is write down all ones and you're just gonna hear even though there's a noise happening.

1324
01:11:46,313 --> 01:11:48,376
Speaker 0: it's just gonna be the loudest possible.

1325
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,240
Speaker 0: constant noise is the flat ones.

1326
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,962
Speaker 1: Yep and even worse.

1327
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:53,664
Speaker 1: and the last point because we've gone long enough.

1328
01:11:55,366 --> 01:12:07,420
Speaker 1: if you have more than one microphone and you record with all of them at the same time they could all the things you recorded could interfere with each other in a way that it didn't interfere in the real world.

1329
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,580
Speaker 1: Because you're well for reasons that we're out of time we've gone way over an hour.

1330
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,618
Speaker 1: That was an okay show I think.

1331
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:22,057
