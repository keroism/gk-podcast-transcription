1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,429
Speaker 0: It's Monday February 12th.

2
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,131
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:16,865
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek night Tonight in layman's terms.

4
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:21,199
Speaker 0: we talk about the parts of computer networking that you might actually care about.

5
00:00:22,883 --> 00:00:23,893
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:30,360
Speaker 1: Well for anyone who maybe listens to only Monday it is the official ness.

7
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:35,740
Speaker 1: I am the job quitting and the new job getting and the weird grammar using.

8
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:38,719
Speaker 1: Indeed be be fair.

9
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:44,179
Speaker 1: No, I finally quit my job of sit in the middle of nowhere and do nothing.

10
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:46,719
Speaker 0: I get paid a lot of money to do that.

11
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:50,011
Speaker 1: Yeah And get paid a lot of money to sit in the middle of nowhere and do nothing.

12
00:00:50,112 --> 00:01:03,080
Speaker 1: I quit that job and now I get Paid 35 percent more to sit in the city and do something the same Something similar some things to what I was supposed to be doing but for somebody else.

13
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:12,740
Speaker 0: So basically someone's paying you more money to actually do your job Exactly, and now you get to take a train instead of driving which while driving is actually cheaper.

14
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,815
Speaker 0: Even as far as we drive the train is so much nicer.

15
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:18,100
Speaker 1: the train is so much nicer.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,980
Speaker 1: And you know I will have to leave a bit earlier in the morning, and I'll get home a little bit later.

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,560
Speaker 0: You'd better not try to take a shower between about six thirty and seven thirty.

18
00:01:29,143 --> 00:01:30,730
Speaker 1: No probably leaving the hat.

19
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,981
Speaker 1: the train that I'm gonna take leaves at 705.

20
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:37,094
Speaker 1: I'll probably be taking a shower between six and six thirty.

21
00:01:37,155 --> 00:01:38,199
Speaker 0: you know it's sad.

22
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:41,516
Speaker 0: lately I used to get up around six and leave the house before seven.

23
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,664
Speaker 0: now I wake up around seven and I run out the door with a Red Bull by like 745.

24
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:49,932
Speaker 1: yeah, well, let's see.

25
00:01:49,972 --> 00:02:06,700
Speaker 1: yeah when I worked in the city I would wake up at five thirty six be at the train at 705 and I'd get home about six Like a 12-hour day, and then when I was working the middle of nowhere You know towards the end when I was getting lazy I was like leaving a little bit after eight and getting home at like five.

26
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:16,511
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah But see if I had a train commute instead of a driving commute while my driving commute commute is actually fairly short the fact that I could basically not have my morning commute.

27
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:18,018
Speaker 0: You know I get up shower all this stuff.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,410
Speaker 0: once I'm on the train just go to sleep.

29
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:22,460
Speaker 0: someone will wake me up when I get to Grand Central.

30
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:27,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, even if no one no other passengers and the train will wake you up.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,510
Speaker 1: There's a person after the train gets to the station their job is to walk down the train Collect stuff for the lost and found etc.

32
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:33,932
Speaker 1: etc.

33
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:35,579
Speaker 1: They will wake you up if you're sleeping there.

34
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,168
Speaker 0: Yep Yep, and then on the way home.

35
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,040
Speaker 0: I can do stuff like read manga.

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,837
Speaker 0: I can't read manga while I'm driving my car as much as I've tried to.

37
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,564
Speaker 1: yeah I am definitely.

38
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:55,680
Speaker 1: I will definitely pick up probably the reading rate and the DS game playing rate and Decrease the podcast listening rate, but you know what honestly more and more I've been listening to fewer and fewer podcasts.

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,004
Speaker 1: Yeah, me.

40
00:02:57,105 --> 00:02:59,497
Speaker 1: I mean I haven't listened to a pen radio in months.

41
00:02:59,637 --> 00:02:59,959
Speaker 1: It's just.

42
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:02,086
Speaker 0: It's kind of lost its charm.

43
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, not podcasting just pen radio.

44
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:07,460
Speaker 0: No yeah, yeah I mean I still listen to Byzantine emperors.

45
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,713
Speaker 0: It's just I don't know.

46
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:13,900
Speaker 0: some podcasts I used to listen to have gotten long to the point where I can't listen to them at all.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,785
Speaker 0: They're just so long.

48
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:15,711
Speaker 0: I'll never get to the end.

49
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:21,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, well anyway I don't start the new job until March 1st, and I don't have to work until then.

50
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:22,419
Speaker 1: I got nothing to do.

51
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're a homemaker.

52
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:28,157
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be doing some awesome shit between now and then starting tomorrow.

53
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:37,938
Speaker 0: right go to the dentist Outstanding followed probably by a rousing game of Super Mario World some autoerotic stimulation in the privacy of the home.

54
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:43,260
Speaker 0: I Imagine you're gonna do some grocery shopping and make copies for katsu khan.

55
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about it that that's.

56
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,391
Speaker 1: that's a.

57
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:53,380
Speaker 0: that's a good guess yep, and of course before we go any further We're gonna remind everyone all week mostly because we're going to be gone starting Thursday.

58
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,632
Speaker 0: But this weekend from Thursday until Sunday.

59
00:03:56,672 --> 00:04:02,650
Speaker 0: We are going to be in Washington DC at Katsu khan at the Omni Shoreham Hotel.

60
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:05,700
Speaker 0: yep katsu khan is one of my favorite anime conventions.

61
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,225
Speaker 0: It's also one of the largest.

62
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:10,316
Speaker 1: it's one of the top 10 biggest anime conventions in the United States.

63
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:11,420
Speaker 0: It's a great con.

64
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:19,190
Speaker 0: It's also more of an older crowd kind like most of the people there tend to be more our age as opposed to Oda khan Where it's people three to four years younger than us.

65
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,079
Speaker 1: That's not to say that there won't be punk kids there.

66
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:29,068
Speaker 1: The percentage of punk kids will be less than the percentage of punk kids that say Kinetic khan anime next or Oda khan.

67
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:32,178
Speaker 0: it also is very special khan in that it's I mean mostly.

68
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:34,246
Speaker 0: now the cons I go to aren't hotel cons.

69
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:37,319
Speaker 0: They're convention center cons meaning they end.

70
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,647
Speaker 0: Yep now we're going.

71
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:46,975
Speaker 0: I mean pretty much anime central and katsu khan are the only hotel cons I've gone to in a long time, and it's a totally different vibe.

72
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,101
Speaker 0: You know they go 24/7.

73
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:53,358
Speaker 0: People tend to stay in the bar all night mostly staffers who should be working.

74
00:04:53,378 --> 00:05:00,980
Speaker 1: yeah 24/7 khan is definitely a completely different experience than a convention khan that closes and you actually go to bed at some point.

75
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:02,872
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean penga khan was great like that.

76
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:08,820
Speaker 0: nothing was better than Wandering out of the room at 3 in the morning and seal seeing like Neil Gaiman just wandering around looking for something to do.

77
00:05:09,262 --> 00:05:10,610
Speaker 1: Hey, I think what kind was excellent.

78
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,387
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, so What's it?

79
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:14,640
Speaker 1: What news is going on here?

80
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:26,751
Speaker 0: Well, it looks like I don't remember the name of the guy who doesn't really matter But someone in the legislature of New York State is putting forth an interesting idea in regards to traffic law And I'm not sure how I feel about this.

81
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:36,520
Speaker 0: all right basically They want to make it a crime punishable by a fine and whatever just like DUI or all that other stuff to drive while tired.

82
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:41,659
Speaker 0: Huh now on one hand a good number of accidents.

83
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,983
Speaker 0: well I won't say accidents.

84
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:51,910
Speaker 0: our traffic collisions in the United States are caused very obviously indirectly By people falling asleep at the wheel or being too tired to pay attention.

85
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,244
Speaker 0: that is true, but on the other hand tired is a 100% subjective.

86
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:05,860
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure there might be a way to measure some sort of tiredness But it's not as easy as say the breathalyzer test for alcohol in this yeah.

87
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,964
Speaker 1: But then again, it's not like you.

88
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:09,534
Speaker 1: they can just walk up and judge you like you're 2.1.

89
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:12,569
Speaker 1: Tired That's 0.3 over the limit.

90
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:23,150
Speaker 0: You're getting a ticket even though at the same time I'm not gonna get into it But I take issue with I mean what not to be perfectly clear people who drive drunk are jackasses To be in jail.

91
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:23,856
Speaker 1: yep.

92
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:36,114
Speaker 0: however It seems like groups like mad have pushed the in some places the top like the level at which you are now a drunk driver Way below the point where alcohol has any measurable effect.

93
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:37,760
Speaker 1: Yes, that is definitely the case.

94
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,749
Speaker 1: I mean the law in Connecticut was like 0.1.

95
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:42,340
Speaker 1: It's like if you have one beer you can't drink.

96
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:47,440
Speaker 1: I mean okay sure someone who drinks should not drive one beer you can drive.

97
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:58,204
Speaker 1: I think I would drive in a car if the person Driving if I knew that they had only if they just drank one beer and they hadn't drunk in anything else and say 24 Hours, and that was it.

98
00:06:58,706 --> 00:06:59,509
Speaker 1: I would let them drive.

99
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would have no problem.

100
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:02,079
Speaker 0: I mean in very much.

101
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:10,127
Speaker 0: I am Super in for in favor of sobriety tests straight-up test to see if this person is yeah I don't even really mind.

102
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,178
Speaker 1: you know so much the roadblocks.

103
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:19,646
Speaker 1: however You know rights freedom and fringing they might be if it's just they look to make sure you're wearing your seat belt And they you know.

104
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:21,515
Speaker 1: make sure you're not drunk seat belt.

105
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:22,680
Speaker 1: not drunk seat belt not drunk.

106
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,804
Speaker 1: I don't really have a problem with that.

107
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:30,200
Speaker 0: and see the thing is most drunk drivers because all the statistics about Alcohol related accidents are kind of skewed in this country.

108
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:37,619
Speaker 0: But in general if someone's actually a drunk driver if you've pulled them over It'll probably be obvious just by looking at them.

109
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:41,952
Speaker 0: Hey, yeah, but it looks like the rule they're proposing.

110
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:49,899
Speaker 0: you stumbled out of that bar into my car, dude Yeah, Rummy No one will believe it if we soak him in Rome.

111
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:56,638
Speaker 0: But it seems like the rule they're looking at would be if you haven't slept in the past 24 hours.

112
00:07:58,381 --> 00:07:59,364
Speaker 1: That's an okay rule.

113
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,451
Speaker 0: I think the thing is it's how did they prove me?

114
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:14,173
Speaker 0: because I have oh yeah one you just lie - I have only gone without sleep for a span of more than 24 hours Two or three times in my life yep, and you know sadly in all of those times.

115
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,800
Speaker 0: I ended that streak by driving somewhere.

116
00:08:18,702 --> 00:08:31,600
Speaker 0: Actually What the longest I ever stayed up was in high school, and I'm not gonna tell the whole story But I ended up staying awake for just about three days straight and at the end of it all I was driving home to go to bed.

117
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:43,880
Speaker 0: And then I woke up like well first I'm driving and I see a red light and I'm like I should stop for that red light and then I stop about 500 feet past the red light, but then then I mean the next thing.

118
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:52,478
Speaker 0: I know I woke up and I had apparently just parked my car Realizing that I shouldn't be driving and just gone to sleep parked at the side of the road perfectly legally.

119
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,706
Speaker 1: yeah That's what I would do.

120
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:57,886
Speaker 1: I mean I always think about it every time And I feel tired.

121
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:05,029
Speaker 1: I say man, I should stop, but I've never actually done it because I've never been I've never reached the point at which.

122
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:06,836
Speaker 1: I just couldn't drive anymore.

123
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:09,760
Speaker 1: if I reach that point I would absolutely pull over and go to sleep.

124
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:18,978
Speaker 0: I've reached that point dozens of times in my life and every one of those times I've pulled over and taken a 15-minute nap which always gave me enough power to keep going the rest of the way.

125
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,133
Speaker 1: the other thing Is I've always been tired close to the destination, so I just make it.

126
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:24,940
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah, I've never not made it.

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,446
Speaker 1: So I'm obviously doing something right.

128
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:29,560
Speaker 0: the worst time ever I was driving back from Rochester.

129
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,146
Speaker 0: I was just bored out of my skull.

130
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:37,709
Speaker 0: so I went out to Rochester from Poughkeepsie to visit so and I ended up staying Five or six hours later than I'd intended.

131
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:41,080
Speaker 0: so I was driving back a five and a half hour drive.

132
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:47,317
Speaker 0: I'd left it like 11 at night and I had worked the next day which I obviously didn't go to.

133
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,578
Speaker 0: I ended up just Parking at a rest stop and sleeping through the night.

134
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:54,916
Speaker 0: Wow cuz after about three hours of driving, I just knew I couldn't make it.

135
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:56,528
Speaker 0: there was no way I could have made it home.

136
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:56,770
Speaker 0: It was.

137
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,920
Speaker 0: I was so miserable.

138
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:05,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course that was also the time I. I was sleeping at the rest stop right and then I woke up kind of halfway.

139
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:06,465
Speaker 0: And here's the thing.

140
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:14,019
Speaker 0: imagine this you're asleep you wake up the first thing you notice Is that you're in a car in the driver's seat with the steering wheel in front of you?

141
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:20,680
Speaker 0: And the second thing you think is that the last thing you remember is driving somewhere and trying not to fall asleep.

142
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:23,852
Speaker 0: So I jumped and panicked and tried to turn the wheel and it wouldn't turn.

143
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:33,758
Speaker 0: and then I look around and I see that I'm parked next to a trucker in a rest stop and this trucker's just looking at me with this look on his face on what the Fuck is up with that guy?

144
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, I don't know how I feel about this.

145
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:40,340
Speaker 0: I probably want to read the actual law in general.

146
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:49,852
Speaker 0: I really don't have any problem with police officers writing tickets to people who are demonstratively Demonstrably, yes, but I wanted to say it all the way through.

147
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:58,262
Speaker 0: Yeah, obviously Impaired for whatever reason I mean really it doesn't matter how you're impaired the fact remains you are Impaired.

148
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:01,820
Speaker 0: if you're actually testably impaired you shouldn't be driving and it's okay if you get a ticket.

149
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:12,700
Speaker 1: I think what it really is gonna end up boiling down to is that if you caused an accident being Because of tiredness or sleepiness at the wheel that you will be hit harder, which is fine by me.

150
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:15,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, well they do that now with alcohol, which I'm also fine with.

151
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:19,159
Speaker 1: Yep, mostly All right, so honey bees.

152
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:21,290
Speaker 1: Mmm, we like honey bees.

153
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:21,873
Speaker 1: They make honey.

154
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,159
Speaker 0: I had some honey a little while ago.

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,909
Speaker 1: apparently there is a Mysterious illness killing lots of honey bees.

156
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:31,654
Speaker 0: Wait, is this that fungus thing from?

157
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,840
Speaker 1: no it they don't know what it is.

158
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,907
Speaker 1: It's a complete mystery.

159
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:49,007
Speaker 1: It is true though that when they've dissected some of the dead bees there was a high number of Fungi bacteria and other organisms in the bees because the bees Immune systems have been weakened.

160
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:52,640
Speaker 1: so it could be be aids or something like that, but we don't know.

161
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:55,440
Speaker 1: It's a mysterious bee illness killing bees everywhere.

162
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:56,159
Speaker 0: That's just real.

163
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,259
Speaker 0: I mean that hearkens back to all those weird parasites that grow inside of bugs But the bugs are still alive and then other bugs come out of them.

164
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:05,215
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to hear something even freakier, right?

165
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:18,331
Speaker 1: Ah, great Normally first of all normally when you have like bees dying in a beehive You know and the you often find the dead bees littered around the hive, you know It's like there's a beehive.

166
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:19,160
Speaker 1: bees die.

167
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:34,380
Speaker 1: You see dead bee corpses lying around, you know, if a bee dies in the hive a worker carries it out Just drops it on the ground, you know, yeah with this mystery disease The bees are apparently flying away from the hive before dying, huh?

168
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:36,406
Speaker 0: That's really kind of creepy.

169
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:37,990
Speaker 0: maybe they know.

170
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,260
Speaker 0: maybe it causes some sort of bee neuroses.

171
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:48,140
Speaker 0: Maybe the bees are trying to escape from the crazy alien monster that is invading their hive.

172
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:53,920
Speaker 1: Also, normally when you have a bee colony that's weakened and there's fewer bees in it because a lot of them die.

173
00:12:54,521 --> 00:13:00,900
Speaker 1: Those beehives would usually be overrun by bees from other colonies or other things that would go after the honey.

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,480
Speaker 0: See I know about that because actually there's this long-running series on corrosion about beekeepers Which is actually really really good and I highly recommend it.

175
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,920
Speaker 1: Like you have a beehive right and all of a sudden half the bees in the beehive die.

176
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:16,280
Speaker 1: Well, now the beehive is pretty weak and no one is only half as many bees to defend the honey treasure.

177
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:18,156
Speaker 1: So someone's gonna come and take it.

178
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:26,874
Speaker 1: Apparently if your hive is struck with a mystery illness It might be weeks before anything else comes to attack the hive to get the honey, huh?

179
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,800
Speaker 1: So it's really kind of freaky.

180
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:31,652
Speaker 0: I don't like the sound of this but we better stock up on honey.

181
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:32,376
Speaker 1: Yeah.

182
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,380
Speaker 1: Well, you see this is the thing.

183
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,159
Speaker 1: Apparently I didn't even realize this.

184
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,866
Speaker 1: Obviously bees are made used to make honey.

185
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:38,729
Speaker 1: That's obvious.

186
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:39,150
Speaker 1: Yes.

187
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:46,160
Speaker 1: Also bees are purposefully brought to Agricultural farms pollinate pollinate things.

188
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:52,182
Speaker 1: Yes This guy drove a truck full of bees across the country and when he got there most of the bees are dead because they got The disease

189
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:52,985
Speaker 0: great

190
00:13:53,387 --> 00:14:01,396
Speaker 1: and it's like, you know, they could have the bees do it to make more bees but it costs a lot of money and if the disease comes you have to do it again and again.

191
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:06,212
Speaker 1: and if you keep having To just keep trying to make more bees too many times keep playing.

192
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,360
Speaker 1: you feel bankrupt trying to make more bees.

193
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:18,230
Speaker 0: You know I just think back to that episode of El Hazzard where Jenna is like I need more bugger him and the queen Insect woman is like, all right come with me.

194
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:18,732
Speaker 0: Yep.

195
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:19,636
Speaker 0: He's like what.

196
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:20,500
Speaker 0: where are we going?

197
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:27,046
Speaker 1: No, I love that part Too bad.

198
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,319
Speaker 0: it's not that easy to make bees.

199
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:32,324
Speaker 0: Yeah but That's kind of creepy.

200
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:36,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing though is I don't know if people realize this.

201
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,829
Speaker 1: You know when you go to the grocery store and you see maple syrup made from real maple trees in Canada All right, or maybe somewhere else and next to it.

202
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,534
Speaker 1: You see the fake maple syrup.

203
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:47,560
Speaker 1: That's just made with sugar or corn syrup.

204
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, the stuff they give you at the diner and Jemima.

205
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:57,996
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jemima and Jemima is not from a maple tree Just so you know people and Jemima is not from a maple tree or a log cabin.

206
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:04,300
Speaker 1: it is yeah log cabin It's just sugar and they process it to make it into maple syrup in a factory.

207
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,632
Speaker 0: So, you know, I actually don't mind log cabin at all.

208
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:09,223
Speaker 1: Well, it's like if I don't know It.

209
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:14,340
Speaker 1: actually it almost tastes like the real thing almost so it's not so bad.

210
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:22,841
Speaker 1: Well, I think whichever one I want at the time cuz at the grocery store I will always buy real maple syrup, but in a diner if they give me the crappy fake stuff I'll eat it.

211
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:26,532
Speaker 0: But see if you can't tell that much then why is spending frou-frou money?

212
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:31,500
Speaker 1: because I can tell I just you know And I prefer the better real syrup.

213
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,687
Speaker 1: But I'll I will suffer the fakes.

214
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:38,725
Speaker 0: but you yell at me when I buy the fancy bottle of wine as opposed as a slightly Less fancy bottle of wine.

215
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:46,716
Speaker 1: All right, there would be a difference if one bottle of wine was made with sugar Just flavored to taste like grapes and one was made with actual grape.

216
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:47,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is wine like that.

217
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,392
Speaker 0: Remember that bottle of red wine I opened the other day.

218
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:52,100
Speaker 1: Is that not made with actual grapes?

219
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:52,882
Speaker 0: It was.

220
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:57,398
Speaker 0: but when you look at the ingredients on a bottle of wine, if it says anything it says wine.

221
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:02,677
Speaker 0: That was a bottle of wine that was cheap enough to have things other than just wine in it.

222
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:21,260
Speaker 1: No anyway There it might not be apparent to everyone but in most parts of the United States At least most parts of the United States that I've been to there is a law Eve my opinion an evil protectionist anti-capitalist line that says you cannot make honey.

223
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:26,740
Speaker 1: I mean if you go to the grocery store, all of the honey is honey from bees.

224
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:28,948
Speaker 1: they don't sell honey just made with sugar.

225
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:36,640
Speaker 1: there's no reason that we couldn't just take sugar and Make something that is exactly or close to being exactly like honey.

226
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:39,800
Speaker 1: I would probably still buy the honey from bees, but that's not the point.

227
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:47,922
Speaker 1: There's a law that says we can't do that meant to support beekeepers and it keeps the price of honey up and the supply of honey Lower.

228
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:53,620
Speaker 1: but now if there's a bee disease the price of honey is gonna go way up like stupid crazy.

229
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,430
Speaker 0: We should start making some bootleg honey and cash in.

230
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:59,320
Speaker 1: you could get in so much trouble making bootleg honey.

231
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,286
Speaker 1: You have no idea.

232
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:01,313
Speaker 0: I'm all about it.

233
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:03,303
Speaker 1: It's all you I mean you could.

234
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:10,991
Speaker 1: I imagine that if you had a big enough bootleg honey operation and they caught you You might get in worse trouble than someone with a meth lab.

235
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:13,339
Speaker 0: It'd be just like the whiskey rebellion.

236
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,128
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, oh, maybe we should do.

237
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:18,093
Speaker 1: it'd be the honey rebellion.

238
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:19,880
Speaker 0: actually we could just be balls instead.

239
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:23,759
Speaker 0: I know where there's a bunch of beekeepers really close to our house.

240
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,660
Speaker 1: You had to go get some bee suits and poach the honey.

241
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:30,257
Speaker 0: Well, remember that park that we used to drive by all the time and you always wondered what was there one.

242
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:34,139
Speaker 0: I went biking over there and there's a whole bunch of bees.

243
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:42,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, like commercial bees beekeeping is pretty popular in the like the Northeast area where I've seriously considered it Cuz.

244
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:45,747
Speaker 0: the more I read about it on corrosion It looks like a very interesting hobby.

245
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:49,160
Speaker 0: if I wasn't doing a podcast I probably would have tried at least once to have bees.

246
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:53,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't mind to have like one bee box, but I think I handle more than one, you know.

247
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:56,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, according to every beekeeper guy though.

248
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:58,595
Speaker 0: You get stung like a thousand times.

249
00:17:58,655 --> 00:18:00,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna avoid that.

250
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,428
Speaker 1: That's not pleasant.

251
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:15,889
Speaker 0: But anyway, horrible bee disease things of the day Oh snaps Didn't you want to try to follow up with?

252
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:16,793
Speaker 0: my awesome?

253
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,500
Speaker 0: Hitler was born to be alive theme week.

254
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:21,030
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know if I'm gonna do exactly that.

255
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,456
Speaker 1: I'm still thinking about something.

256
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,535
Speaker 1: That's so amazing You know, I'm working on it.

257
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:34,474
Speaker 1: But this week I will do a theme week regardless and since I only have to do three things It shouldn't be too hard because we're not gonna do things today on Thursday because we're going to katsukan.

258
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:35,939
Speaker 0: All right katsukan.

259
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:43,972
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, but basically I found this really cool video From back in the day of some jazz action.

260
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:45,979
Speaker 1: I figured I'd follow up your disco with some jazz.

261
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,743
Speaker 1: and What's his name?

262
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:50,312
Speaker 1: Brubaker Dave Brubeck Dave Brubeck?

263
00:18:50,774 --> 00:18:52,179
Speaker 1: Yeah Brubaker is a comic guy.

264
00:18:53,941 --> 00:19:16,580
Speaker 1: Dave Brubeck and his band playing an awesome song and the guy does an awesome drum solo on a rather minimalist Drum set which I think is really impressive, you know And I just reminded me I look at all bands now and when you see a drummer in a band They got a bajillion drums and a whole bunch of stuff this guy That drum set looks like the thing that you can buy for a couple hundred bucks and like media play.

265
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:23,466
Speaker 1: Media plays still existed, you know, it's the cheapest drum set for a little kid That actually is real drums yet.

266
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:28,059
Speaker 1: He's playing a really awesome drum solo on it and that's pretty damn cool.

267
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:30,307
Speaker 0: See I could recommend.

268
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:32,656
Speaker 0: I mean do you have any more things the day for this thing?

269
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:40,160
Speaker 1: Cuz I mean, yeah YouTube basically anyone out there if you like videos of old-timey jazz, that's really awesome.

270
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:43,489
Speaker 1: YouTube is like a treasure trove.

271
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,452
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

272
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:50,049
Speaker 1: It's impossible not to find Yeah, awesome jazz on YouTube or Google video.

273
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:52,135
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess I would generally recommend count.

274
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:59,318
Speaker 0: Basie is always good Buddy rich my man my absolute man mostly cuz I like playing all his stuff.

275
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,940
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, so I'm gonna bring this one's really good and I'll bring two more to you this week tomorrow the next day.

276
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:06,270
Speaker 1: All right, so awesome.

277
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:07,519
Speaker 0: can't argue with that.

278
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:21,480
Speaker 0: I mean Hitler born to be alive was one thing but I don't think Hitler born to be alive in terms of raw I don't know ability or Actual impact on the world has anything on actual jazz from the golden ages of jazz?

279
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:25,611
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we should I don't know pick a different genre of music each time.

280
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:30,539
Speaker 1: Who knows I call techno damn Easy.

281
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:36,080
Speaker 0: It's not so easy because there's more kinds of techno than there are days.

282
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,472
Speaker 1: I still want to do a show explaining all the different kinds of techno.

283
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:40,957
Speaker 1: Well electronic music.

284
00:20:40,977 --> 00:20:43,964
Speaker 1: Yeah Electronic dance music.

285
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:47,134
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I mean you don't want there is non dance electronic.

286
00:20:47,154 --> 00:20:48,177
Speaker 0: Well, there's electro pop.

287
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:59,311
Speaker 1: Yeah Be a good show cuz a lot of people you go up to them and you're like Techno house industrial trance and they don't know the difference between those things.

288
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:01,497
Speaker 0: Don't forget my favorite my boys.

289
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:12,348
Speaker 1: Happy hardcore Yeah, and those are all completely different genres of music and most people just call it all techno when it's not the case Even though usually in casual conversation I call it all techno because it.

290
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:14,320
Speaker 1: I also call it all techno and casual.

291
00:21:14,922 --> 00:21:24,360
Speaker 0: Like if I I only will break it up if I'm talking to I don't know a DJ or if I'm at a dance And I want to ask for a specific kind of music.

292
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,185
Speaker 1: It's also interesting to learn about the origins of all the different genres, you know Cuz they're actually.

293
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:32,319
Speaker 1: some of them are pretty recently created and it's pretty cool.

294
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:43,156
Speaker 0: Also, if you type any one of those genres of electronic music into the Pirates Bay You'll pretty much find 10 and 15 CD compilations of everything you'd ever want from them.

295
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:43,578
Speaker 1: Yep.

296
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,326
Speaker 1: All right What are we talking about today?

297
00:21:46,586 --> 00:21:48,131
Speaker 1: Well, we're talking about your thing today.

298
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:49,434
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

299
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:49,835
Speaker 1: Okay.

300
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:51,440
Speaker 0: No, I didn't great.

301
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:52,243
Speaker 1: Okay.

302
00:21:52,383 --> 00:21:55,132
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you can't tell we stayed up late pretty much all weekend.

303
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:56,336
Speaker 1: I didn't.

304
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:57,420
Speaker 1: I don't have work to do.

305
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,748
Speaker 1: I've been sleeping and going ahead.

306
00:21:58,769 --> 00:21:59,453
Speaker 1: That's why I caught it.

307
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:00,097
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

308
00:22:00,137 --> 00:22:00,560
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

309
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,420
Speaker 0: But when I came home and I said you you were so tired you were talking about tired you were yeah.

310
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,000
Speaker 0: And then when I asked how could you be so tired you said?

311
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:11,722
Speaker 0: Well, I got up early and I did stuff all day I did.

312
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:15,180
Speaker 1: I got up at 830 which is when my body woke up and I wasn't tired.

313
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:19,976
Speaker 0: So, uh, what do you mean all this extra sleep business and get an extra sleep?

314
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,731
Speaker 0: Uh-huh We'll see how you feel when you start working again.

315
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:35,722
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like ass but anyway this I've seen this floating around on the internet bit by bit and I want to just Point it out and talk about it because I think it's both a good flash video and at the same time a kind of bad Flash video.

316
00:22:36,022 --> 00:23:03,840
Speaker 0: it's a little video that someone put together that describes very simply how instant runoff voting works Which is a very interesting system you can use in Political voting or really any kind of voting that more often in most cases will give you a better representation of what a large number of people actually Want in a candidate in cases where there are more than two people running in an election.

317
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:09,096
Speaker 0: Yep, and IRVs are used in a bunch of places in the world.

318
00:23:09,136 --> 00:23:10,380
Speaker 0: I mean Australia uses them.

319
00:23:11,364 --> 00:23:14,600
Speaker 0: I forget what other places I think Ireland but I don't ever offhand.

320
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:22,678
Speaker 1: There are places in the world that use instant runoff voting as opposed to the kind of voting that everyone else uses Which is just you direct voting.

321
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:26,573
Speaker 0: Now remember instant runoff is one very specific kind and there are.

322
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:28,440
Speaker 1: there are many kinds of voting there.

323
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,446
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of similar.

324
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:32,369
Speaker 1: Imagine a world.

325
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:34,074
Speaker 1: We're like dig for the president.

326
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:35,859
Speaker 1: great dig dig dig dig dig.

327
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:37,707
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of voting.

328
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,620
Speaker 0: vote for this picture of my cat to be president.

329
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:47,576
Speaker 0: I Don't know how I feel about the fact that a lot of dig front stories now are just a picture on flicker.

330
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:49,822
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

331
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:53,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, so there are a bunch of different kinds of runoff voting.

332
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:56,298
Speaker 0: The one in particular of interest is IRV.

333
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,380
Speaker 0: It's the one that's been gaining a lot of steam in the United States lately.

334
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:04,980
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people who are proponents of it and there are websites and flash videos like this explaining how it works.

335
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:08,960
Speaker 0: And I'd say you should all watch it because it gives a really good rundown of how the system works.

336
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,739
Speaker 0: Basically, you rank a bunch of candidates in the order that you like them.

337
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:15,000
Speaker 0: It then counts everyone's first choice and it's a normal vote.

338
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,553
Speaker 0: If a candidate has a majority they win and the it's over.

339
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:21,446
Speaker 0: if no one has a majority They drop.

340
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:24,000
Speaker 0: whatever candidate has the least votes.

341
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:33,879
Speaker 0: then they take Everyone who voted for that candidate and use their second choice instead of their first choice and you keep going down the line Until someone gets the majority of the votes.

342
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:36,405
Speaker 1: What aren't people gonna need?

343
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:38,933
Speaker 1: to have as many choices as there are candidates?

344
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:42,505
Speaker 1: like if there's five candidates You're gonna need to make four choices.

345
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,170
Speaker 0: Well, you don't need to the.

346
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,380
Speaker 0: the system can be run in a bunch of different ways.

347
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:56,520
Speaker 0: I mean you could do it where no one needs a majority But you use the majority in the first set and then you just count the second or the third or whatever arbitrary set as gold.

348
00:24:57,023 --> 00:25:00,059
Speaker 0: You can do whatever you want and there's no rule as to how it has to be done.

349
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:01,462
Speaker 0: The.

350
00:25:01,582 --> 00:25:07,121
Speaker 0: the thing that I just want to point out is that this video while it very simply describes the the voting system Yeah,

351
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:21,111
Speaker 1: it is clear that this video this flash video is pro and sin right off voting yes, and it is attempting to explain it in a and present it in a favorable light to someone who Isn't gonna think too hard about it now.

352
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:25,833
Speaker 0: while it is a very favorable thing anyway And I'm very much for it in in most cases.

353
00:25:26,435 --> 00:25:27,500
Speaker 0: It does have problems.

354
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:37,110
Speaker 0: There is no such thing as a voting system that does not as probably have problems or that will always no matter what the circumstances Accurately reflect the view of the majority.

355
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,339
Speaker 0: There's just no way to really do it.

356
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:42,713
Speaker 0: And I also worry that a system like this might confuse people in the.

357
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:46,467
Speaker 1: well, okay, there's no Practical way to do it.

358
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:48,134
Speaker 1: You could use psychic powers.

359
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:51,240
Speaker 0: I Don't know if we get brain scanners enough.

360
00:25:51,300 --> 00:26:01,440
Speaker 1: I mean everyone just plugs in one day and then they show you all the candidates and then they make you read all their Platforms and they see when your brain is happy and when it's not happy and then they pick based on that.

361
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:03,592
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

362
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

363
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:15,540
Speaker 0: I just thought this was interesting and the reason I actually picked it was that I was going to use my favorite episode of space Ghost ever space ghost and the fire ants which just overall it's my favorite space ghost.

364
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:23,200
Speaker 0: I was gonna talk all about space ghost and What was great about it and how you had to watch it to actually enjoy it as opposed to it being just stupid.

365
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:29,880
Speaker 0: But uh Warner went on a rampage and got almost every piece of space ghost on the internet taken down.

366
00:26:30,301 --> 00:26:35,219
Speaker 0: So I I could not in a short span of time find a link to my previous thing of the day.

367
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:39,138
Speaker 0: If I find it, I will use it as my thing of the day ASAP.

368
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:46,860
Speaker 0: Okay, but anyway, you're listening to a podcast which means in some way you have used the internet once or twice.

369
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,258
Speaker 1: Use the Internet's OMG.

370
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,611
Speaker 0: Now I remember when I used to play games online.

371
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:59,440
Speaker 0: one time I was playing quake 2 on a server and There was an argument someone was accusing someone else of cheating.

372
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:04,720
Speaker 0: The server was run by some 12 year old moron who accused a friend of mine of cheating.

373
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:15,476
Speaker 0: now the rationale for his accusation was one that the guy was doing really well and To that his IP address had zero in it, which he swore you can't do.

374
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:16,960
Speaker 0: this guy's totally hacking.

375
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,619
Speaker 0: He has a zero in his IP address and then he banned the hell.

376
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,346
Speaker 1: Okay, that guy doesn't know shit.

377
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:23,168
Speaker 0: Yeah.

378
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:27,854
Speaker 0: See the thing is a lot of people know what IP addresses are DNS and all that.

379
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:30,830
Speaker 0: you type www.google.com and you get somewhere.

380
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:36,620
Speaker 0: you have two computers in your house and You might know how to use a windows share to get files from one to the other one or whatever.

381
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:43,825
Speaker 0: but a lot of people don't really know how IP addresses and Internet connections work.

382
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:47,856
Speaker 1: It's actually you know, it's not so complicated.

383
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:48,859
Speaker 1: You can't understand it.

384
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:52,839
Speaker 1: It's just not really obvious and there are some tricks going on there.

385
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,414
Speaker 1: Yep, you're not gonna know unless someone tells you or you figure it out on a whole.

386
00:27:57,434 --> 00:28:14,454
Speaker 0: it is very complicated if you try to take the whole thing in as a whole from Electrons being manipulated on a wire to you getting your gay lesbian furry Hentai girl Pornography whatever you're after on the internet.

387
00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:15,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, think about that.

388
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:23,348
Speaker 1: All the internet is is a bunch of pornography copper wires and fiber optic cables Connecting a bunch of machines together.

389
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:29,588
Speaker 1: also wireless connecting a bunch of machines together millions and millions of machines all connected to each other.

390
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:37,975
Speaker 1: somehow and Yet somehow magically information from just about any machine can get to any other machine when you want it to.

391
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:47,291
Speaker 0: and think of this the Information that you're sending and receiving is just waves on Wires that can be translated into ones and zeros.

392
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:50,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, so how do those ones and zeros know where to go?

393
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:56,959
Speaker 0: How do they get specifically on the exact right wire to get from my computers in front of me now?

394
00:28:57,681 --> 00:29:03,620
Speaker 0: All the way out to the internet to someone else's computer up the right wire and then into the right program on that computer.

395
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:05,311
Speaker 1: It's crazy when you think about it.

396
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:13,900
Speaker 1: electrons on wires Somehow which are equal porn and they make it all the way around the world in his crazy maze.

397
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,356
Speaker 1: That's more complex than any road you've ever driven on and they do it so fast.

398
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:19,280
Speaker 1: It's insane.

399
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:23,257
Speaker 0: I mean think about when I send Scott an instant message in his room while I'm in my room.

400
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:30,778
Speaker 0: the program I'm using goes out to the internet through a bunch of rock network equipment in our house to our server front row.

401
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:39,500
Speaker 0: crew calm in Gets manipulated there comes back into our house goes down a different wire into Scott's computer and then sends him a message.

402
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:43,252
Speaker 1: It's really crazy and you think about it in the big picture.

403
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,500
Speaker 1: It's it's absolutely unbelievable that it works.

404
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:53,219
Speaker 1: That's why you always hear computer people say it's a miracle that's even works, you know, cuz it's true It is a miracle that any of this shit works.

405
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:57,875
Speaker 0: Now the thing is while how that all works is super complicated.

406
00:29:57,895 --> 00:29:59,420
Speaker 0: There's a lot to it in a lot of steps.

407
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:01,751
Speaker 0: It's actually very simple to understand.

408
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:07,575
Speaker 0: if you break it up into each Individual component and there aren't actually that many components to it aren't there.

409
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:08,920
Speaker 1: seven eight eight.

410
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:11,089
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is we're gonna use the five layer.

411
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,780
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz no one uses the full OSI model.

412
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:24,340
Speaker 0: No, but no, but to make a long story short the way an information is sent over networks has been broken up into Depending on how you look at it a number of layers.

413
00:30:24,662 --> 00:30:28,280
Speaker 0: So think of it like a big stack of pancakes or a stack a stack of boxes.

414
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:46,022
Speaker 0: you've got a stack of boxes and you start at the top and you put a kind of thing in a box and Then you put that thing in another box and that thing in another box to say I want to write a letter to My friend Adam who lives in a house up with a bunch of other people in Albany, you know I'm male.

415
00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:48,755
Speaker 0: so I take my letter and I write the information on it.

416
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:49,740
Speaker 1: The letter is the porn.

417
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,280
Speaker 0: Yes, then I write Adams name on the letter.

418
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,359
Speaker 0: So Adam knows this letters for him and I sign it saying this letters for me.

419
00:30:57,102 --> 00:31:01,857
Speaker 0: Then I encapsulate this letter I fold it up and I put it inside of an envelope.

420
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:10,280
Speaker 0: on the envelope I put different information that says, you know, what city what town what house where it's from where it's going to the postage.

421
00:31:10,962 --> 00:31:15,580
Speaker 0: Yep, because the post office the intermediaries don't care what's in my letter.

422
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:19,360
Speaker 0: They don't care who Adam is they don't care that Adams getting my letter.

423
00:31:19,762 --> 00:31:22,159
Speaker 0: All they care about is where to deliver the letter.

424
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:27,260
Speaker 0: So I encapsulate it in this envelope and the envelope has all the information that the post office needs.

425
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:29,930
Speaker 0: The post office looks at it figures out where to go.

426
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:32,520
Speaker 0: So it gets to the house where Adam and all his friends live.

427
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,847
Speaker 0: Steve grabs it from the mailbox.

428
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:35,851
Speaker 0: He looks at it.

429
00:31:36,293 --> 00:31:37,217
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a letter to our house.

430
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:37,819
Speaker 0: He opens it up.

431
00:31:38,282 --> 00:31:39,693
Speaker 0: It says Adam on the inside.

432
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:40,660
Speaker 0: Oh, this is for Adam.

433
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:49,095
Speaker 0: so he opens the encapsulation finds the more specific information that wasn't relevant to the outside world and Then he gives it to whoever it has to go to.

434
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:54,818
Speaker 0: The internet works in exactly the same way only with a lot more envelopes.

435
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,404
Speaker 1: Yep I mean an envelope.

436
00:31:56,424 --> 00:32:00,660
Speaker 1: you put it in another envelope put another envelope and eventually the envelope is just electrons.

437
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,839
Speaker 1: And then you take all the envelopes off of the electrons and it turns into prawn.

438
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:13,020
Speaker 0: now We thought originally we'd start podcast from the bottom up because basically it starts at the very bottom that the physical layer the actual.

439
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,511
Speaker 0: you Know there's electricity wires Electricity wireless fire all that stuff brimstone.

440
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:23,327
Speaker 0: and then above that there's something called the data link layer And then there's the network layer.

441
00:32:23,347 --> 00:32:26,500
Speaker 0: Then there's a transport layer and then there's the application layer.

442
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:35,659
Speaker 0: But if we do that This will probably be really boring and tedious because it would take a long time just to talk about the physical layer And that's the part that you don't really ever interact with.

443
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:46,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean other than plugging wires in how the physical layer works is interesting to us But you don't ever need to know that basically ever like I kind of know it I never need to know it.

444
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,154
Speaker 1: if I never knew it.

445
00:32:48,194 --> 00:32:51,412
Speaker 0: It wouldn't bother my life in the lead Yep, and if I need to know it, I look it up again.

446
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:52,620
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.

447
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:55,680
Speaker 0: So we're gonna start with and we'll you know, we'll explain what these are.

448
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:56,399
Speaker 0: Don't worry about it.

449
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,640
Speaker 0: But we're gonna start with the data link layer and then move into the network layer now just so you know.

450
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,749
Speaker 0: So you have a frame of reference.

451
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:14,851
Speaker 0: in case you know something about computers The data link layer is basically Mac addresses and the network layer is basically IP addresses Yep, and you probably have the most interaction with those.

452
00:33:15,132 --> 00:33:18,881
Speaker 0: the next layer up for anyone who wants to read ahead is Ports.

453
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:21,080
Speaker 0: you've worked with those, you know use bit torrent.

454
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:25,780
Speaker 0: You have to use certain ports type certain ports in open ports up in the firewall all that stuff.

455
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:28,372
Speaker 1: That's the TCPs and the UDPs and all that stuff.

456
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:29,860
Speaker 0: Yep, and that's the next layer up.

457
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:37,660
Speaker 0: We're not gonna talk about that right now Yep, and also we're gonna go very briefly about the data link layer because you know, it's not really that complicated.

458
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless you wanted all the stupid details.

459
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:40,680
Speaker 0: I mean think of this.

460
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,776
Speaker 0: Let's say you've got a simple network a non-intelligent network a flat network.

461
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:47,120
Speaker 0: You've got your house, right?

462
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,919
Speaker 0: You've got a hub that you bought and you've got three computers connected to it.

463
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:55,560
Speaker 1: So you have three computers and they're all have wires connecting every single computer.

464
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,730
Speaker 1: So every computer has a wire going from it to every other computer.

465
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:02,121
Speaker 1: somehow because there's a hub and that's basically what a hub is Yep.

466
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:08,687
Speaker 0: So let's say you want to send information from computer a to computer B. Oh How do the computers do that?

467
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:11,300
Speaker 1: I mean, it's just wires connecting the computers, right?

468
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,030
Speaker 1: So how would one computer know which information goes to who?

469
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:18,400
Speaker 1: how does it guide it along one wire instead of another wire?

470
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,340
Speaker 0: It's basically how do you send information?

471
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:35,060
Speaker 0: period to another computer When all computers are equal on the same flat network where they can all see each other and that's why it's called the data link Layer, it's the lowest logical layer where you set up a data link between two computers.

472
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,840
Speaker 0: So two computers come up with a way to talk to each other and send data between themselves.

473
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:40,241
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

474
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:43,493
Speaker 1: The way it is done is with the magical.

475
00:34:43,674 --> 00:34:45,239
Speaker 1: Well the way there's many ways to do it.

476
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,237
Speaker 1: I mean I could come up with a brand new way of doing it right now and just implement it and it work.

477
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:51,060
Speaker 0: probably as We're talking we're going to talk.

478
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,629
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about the way that it is done with.

479
00:34:53,829 --> 00:35:01,059
Speaker 0: you know ether nets and the things that you use on the Internet's every Day, yes I mean if you know more about networking than what we're talking about right now.

480
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:05,018
Speaker 0: We also know but most of you don't care so we're not gonna get into that.

481
00:35:05,118 --> 00:35:05,480
Speaker 1: that's right.

482
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:11,140
Speaker 1: Well, the way it is commonly done these days is with a MAC address your network card.

483
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,514
Speaker 1: The thing in your computer that the wire plugs into has a MAC address.

484
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,660
Speaker 0: This is a very large number.

485
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,600
Speaker 0: It's a hexadecimal number and as on any given network, this number is unique.

486
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,720
Speaker 0: There are so many of them that no two computers in a house.

487
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:31,760
Speaker 0: The odds of them having the same number are so remote that it'll never happen.

488
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:35,732
Speaker 1: Usually the beginning of the number is the same for like every like.

489
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:43,120
Speaker 1: if you buy a three comm card and another three comm Card the beginning of the number will probably be the same for both cards, you know.

490
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,327
Speaker 1: But the entire number is never the same.

491
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:49,320
Speaker 1: also a lot of cards allow you to just change the number to whatever you want.

492
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:54,120
Speaker 0: So so if you really wanted to you could cause a problem for yourself by making all your Mac address.

493
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:59,916
Speaker 1: Two computers on the same network have the same exact Mac address that they're not different at all.

494
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:01,140
Speaker 1: That will not work.

495
00:36:01,221 --> 00:36:02,139
Speaker 1: They'll have a problem.

496
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:11,920
Speaker 1: but for all intents and purposes The Mac addresses will always be unique and the odds of them not being unique by accident are so ludicrously small.

497
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:12,918
Speaker 1: It's not a concern.

498
00:36:13,602 --> 00:36:16,410
Speaker 0: So basically to simplify greatly.

499
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,333
Speaker 0: just so this is easy.

500
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:26,520
Speaker 0: if you want to talk to another computer What your computer says is I have information for Mac address X and ever issues single-digit numbers.

501
00:36:26,741 --> 00:36:28,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you have computers one, two, three and four.

502
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,120
Speaker 0: Yep, and they have Mac addresses one, two, three and four.

503
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:35,080
Speaker 0: Yep, so computer one says I have data for computer three.

504
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,679
Speaker 0: Here it is and it sends it out to the network and all the computers see it.

505
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,000
Speaker 1: Yep, because I mean there's just dumb wires connecting every computer.

506
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,031
Speaker 1: It can't choose to set it's only sending it out one wire.

507
00:36:45,232 --> 00:36:46,497
Speaker 1: every computer hears this.

508
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:47,420
Speaker 1: it's like yelling.

509
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:49,772
Speaker 1: It's like hey, I got something for number three.

510
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,379
Speaker 1: It's on for number three.

511
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:58,160
Speaker 0: Yep, and number one and number four by every other computer no matter how many there are has logic inside of it.

512
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,260
Speaker 0: There could be software or hardware that looks at that number and says that is not for me.

513
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:06,233
Speaker 0: I will ignore it or that is for me.

514
00:37:06,695 --> 00:37:07,900
Speaker 0: I will take it and process.

515
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,226
Speaker 1: Yep, so number one goes.

516
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:13,465
Speaker 1: I got something for number three and two and four go Oh, they don't do shit.

517
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:16,560
Speaker 1: and number three goes me me me me me me me me me me me me me me.

518
00:37:16,761 --> 00:37:18,326
Speaker 1: that's me now.

519
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:24,311
Speaker 0: the drawbacks of this are that every computer hears every conversation that goes on in the entire network.

520
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:26,682
Speaker 0: yeah and a number of other problems.

521
00:37:26,984 --> 00:37:30,320
Speaker 0: the thing is while computers hear the information they don't look at it.

522
00:37:30,722 --> 00:37:34,340
Speaker 0: it's like if I start talking to Scott in French and Scott understands French.

523
00:37:34,701 --> 00:37:37,311
Speaker 0: but to use Adam again Adam is taking her.

524
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:40,706
Speaker 0: he doesn't understand French he can't understand what I'm saying.

525
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:44,706
Speaker 0: but if I hadn't wanted to be tricky he could go into promiscuous mode.

526
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,657
Speaker 1: yeah we're not gonna talk about that.

527
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:50,056
Speaker 0: yeah but just in case anyone wondered people you know you hear that word a lot.

528
00:37:50,176 --> 00:38:01,847
Speaker 0: all promiscuous mode is is where you have a computer and not only will it listen to the stuff that's for it but you can tell it to listen to everything it hears on the wire regardless of who it's for.

529
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:12,047
Speaker 1: this is why if you plug into a hub or a Wi-Fi network you know usually with some other people around and there's no switches or routers between you and them.

530
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:17,357
Speaker 1: you're just on a hub that you can see what they're doing on the internet by entering promiscuous mode.

531
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:18,384
Speaker 1: that's a security yeah.

532
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:23,320
Speaker 0: so Adam can sit there with a French to English dictionary and figure out what we were saying even though he shouldn't really be listening.

533
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,043
Speaker 0: and oh he should.

534
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:24,807
Speaker 0: and there is no.

535
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,756
Speaker 0: well I can't say there's no way.

536
00:38:27,017 --> 00:38:28,987
Speaker 0: there is almost no way for us to figure out.

537
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:29,691
Speaker 0: this is happening.

538
00:38:29,953 --> 00:38:32,467
Speaker 1: yeah we're not gonna get into the way you hear it out.

539
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:33,854
Speaker 1: there is a way to figure it out.

540
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:35,887
Speaker 0: there is some awesome stuff I can talk about.

541
00:38:35,907 --> 00:38:40,914
Speaker 0: if there's anyone out there who's interested we can do an episode about the more technical aspects of all.

542
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:47,218
Speaker 1: yeah we could do like how to detect hackers on your network and stuff interesting but complicated stuff.

543
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:49,690
Speaker 0: if you guys want a technical episode like that let us know.

544
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,895
Speaker 0: yeah anyway.

545
00:38:51,036 --> 00:39:01,647
Speaker 0: so number three goes me me me me me me me me and number one here's that and they just talk back and forth and to ignores the whole conversation and if two wants to talk he talks to whoever and it just works.

546
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:06,616
Speaker 0: yep now obviously this is and this is how computers worked for a long time because there weren't that many computers.

547
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,630
Speaker 0: so you've got one network now like this.

548
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:11,970
Speaker 1: yeah I mean you would have computers networked like with a daisy chain.

549
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,015
Speaker 1: we're like computer.

550
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:23,247
Speaker 1: one would be plugged into two two would be plugged into three three would be plugged into four and if they wanted to talk it just went back and forth down the row or even if they were all with a hub.

551
00:39:23,287 --> 00:39:24,533
Speaker 0: so they all had their own wires.

552
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:29,138
Speaker 0: it was still as though it was one big wire where every conversation is everywhere.

553
00:39:29,178 --> 00:39:31,067
Speaker 0: now imagine if the whole internet was like that.

554
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:41,520
Speaker 0: it would grind to a halt because anytime someone looking at pornography on a Chinese computer from France my computer is gonna hear that conversation and so is every other computer in the world.

555
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,129
Speaker 1: Imagine hearing all the porn in the world at once.

556
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:48,987
Speaker 0: that's far worse than any Lovecraftian horror it is.

557
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:51,555
Speaker 1: I think it's a new Lovecraftian horror.

558
00:39:52,317 --> 00:40:00,611
Speaker 1: Wow hearing the internet porndulu there's probably a website about that and it's not it's it's probably you know what.

559
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:04,028
Speaker 0: I can almost say with certainty that there effectively are hentai about that.

560
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,354
Speaker 1: yeah all right.

561
00:40:05,395 --> 00:40:06,018
Speaker 0: so all right.

562
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:07,485
Speaker 1: so how do we solve that problem?

563
00:40:07,525 --> 00:40:09,716
Speaker 1: yes well how do we defeat porndulu?

564
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:12,551
Speaker 0: we were talking as though there's one network the network in your house.

565
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:15,063
Speaker 0: now what if you have more than one network.

566
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:19,238
Speaker 0: now to skip a lot a network is segregated.

567
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:24,062
Speaker 0: so we've got the flat network in my house and then we've got another flat network up in Adams house.

568
00:40:24,263 --> 00:40:32,164
Speaker 0: so he has his three computers one two and three and I have my three computers A B and C and all three of my computers can talk and all three his computers can talk.

569
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:36,063
Speaker 0: but none of those computers know my computers exist and vice-versa.

570
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:38,191
Speaker 0: how can they talk to each other?

571
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:39,858
Speaker 0: that is what an internet is.

572
00:40:39,878 --> 00:40:42,973
Speaker 0: you see you see you know uppercase internet lowercase internet.

573
00:40:43,536 --> 00:40:44,843
Speaker 0: there can be an internet.

574
00:40:44,923 --> 00:40:47,737
Speaker 0: an internet is just multiple networks connected together.

575
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:53,000
Speaker 1: yep when someone says the internet with a capital I they are talking about the internet.

576
00:40:53,080 --> 00:41:02,465
Speaker 1: the thing that this podcast is being delivered to you on the series of tubes yes is the capital I internet yes which refers specifically to either internet one or internet two.

577
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:08,384
Speaker 1: yep lowercase I internet is just networks that are connected to each other.

578
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:11,115
Speaker 1: or maybe you could say they are internet work.

579
00:41:11,316 --> 00:41:12,641
Speaker 1: oh oh oh.

580
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:14,107
Speaker 1: that's lowercase I internet.

581
00:41:14,468 --> 00:41:16,517
Speaker 0: now this is layer three the network layer.

582
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:19,647
Speaker 0: it's also the IP layer IP addresses.

583
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:31,650
Speaker 0: you see all an IP address is is a set of numbers that tell you if you know how to read it what network a computer is on and then on that network which computer it is.

584
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,035
Speaker 0: so it's kind of like a street address.

585
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:40,186
Speaker 0: so if a MAC address is my name rim or Scott's name Scott then an IP address is the address on the front of our house.

586
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,517
Speaker 1: yep it's like you find our house.

587
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:45,009
Speaker 1: you know it's like the network is the roads.

588
00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:46,616
Speaker 1: you find our house by our address.

589
00:41:47,058 --> 00:41:55,229
Speaker 1: but there's two MAC addresses here rim and Scott and then you need to figure out which one of those and you'd open up the envelope and it would say rim or Scott inside and then you deliver to the right place.

590
00:41:55,610 --> 00:42:05,734
Speaker 0: now it used to be that you know IP addresses are number dot number dot number dot number used to be broken up where all networks boundaries were on those numbers.

591
00:42:05,794 --> 00:42:09,049
Speaker 1: so say in the olden days when there weren't so many computers.

592
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:23,500
Speaker 0: so the way this works and I promise it'll make sense say you've got an IP address 129 dot 21 dot 21 dot one that is actually a very useful DNS server that you can all hit as much as you want.

593
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:27,073
Speaker 0: hooray it's always up and it's at our IT awesome.

594
00:42:27,113 --> 00:42:28,177
Speaker 0: it's also easy to remember.

595
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:30,666
Speaker 0: but you know if you got this IP address 129 dot 21 dot 21 dot one.

596
00:42:30,707 --> 00:42:36,687
Speaker 0: now this would be let's say this would be a class B address.

597
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:43,187
Speaker 0: so in the old days the 129 dot 21 was the network address.

598
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:52,333
Speaker 0: so 129 dot 21 dot 0.0 was one network as far as the every IP address from 129 21 0 0 through 129 21 255 255.

599
00:42:52,333 --> 00:43:00,862
Speaker 1: it was all the same network.

600
00:43:01,263 --> 00:43:03,290
Speaker 1: that's what 200. that's a lot of computers.

601
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,216
Speaker 0: yes a lot of computers.

602
00:43:05,477 --> 00:43:05,858
Speaker 1: yeah.

603
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:18,472
Speaker 0: so you know 129.21.0.0 is the network but the IP address is 129.21.21.1. the dot is the specific computer in that network.

604
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:29,146
Speaker 0: so when I send a packet out when I want to send data to that computer I put in the IP address 129.21.21.1. it goes out to the internet and hits a router.

605
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,471
Speaker 0: the router doesn't care what computer it's going to because that would be stupid.

606
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,482
Speaker 0: it would have to know wherever computer in the world was.

607
00:43:36,044 --> 00:43:38,753
Speaker 0: it only actually cares where the networks are.

608
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:44,253
Speaker 0: so it sees Oh 129.21. that network is this way.

609
00:43:44,353 --> 00:43:46,059
Speaker 1: yep I think about what a router is.

610
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:47,406
Speaker 1: it's basically a machine.

611
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:53,493
Speaker 1: it's a really a computer with a bunch of network cables coming into it and each one goes someplace different.

612
00:43:54,015 --> 00:44:05,398
Speaker 1: and all the router really has to do when you get right down to it is take stuff in from a wire and figure out which other wire maybe even the same wire to send it out on.

613
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:07,708
Speaker 1: you know it's it's it's like a mail sorting guy.

614
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:25,220
Speaker 1: so when it comes in he says this is 129 and the router is configured to know if it says 129 it goes out that wire and he sends it out that wire and it gets to another router and another router and the routers as you get closer they know more about where it's supposed to go.

615
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:32,466
Speaker 0: yep so 129 and then 21 and eventually it gets to the edge of the RIT network the 129.21 network.

616
00:44:32,827 --> 00:44:40,234
Speaker 0: the router on the outside at the edge and the whole world knows nothing about what's behind that router because they don't have to.

617
00:44:40,877 --> 00:44:51,591
Speaker 0: that router doesn't know anything about the rest of the world other than how to get out but it knows everything about the stuff inside of it or at least I mean it could be broken up into little sub networks within.

618
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:52,557
Speaker 0: but don't worry about that.

619
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:55,631
Speaker 0: so that net that computer says all right I'm the 129.21 network.

620
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,844
Speaker 0: this packet is obviously for me.

621
00:44:59,266 --> 00:45:09,102
Speaker 0: so it looks inside and says oh it's going to 21.1. and it says it wants to send it to 21.1. and there's a computer called 21.1. now the data link layer.

622
00:45:09,142 --> 00:45:11,069
Speaker 0: those MAC addresses are still there.

623
00:45:11,531 --> 00:45:12,776
Speaker 0: how does what?

624
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:14,984
Speaker 0: how does my computer know that 121 that 21.1 is my name.

625
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:21,825
Speaker 0: I know what my MAC address is and I know what my IP address is.

626
00:45:22,127 --> 00:45:27,309
Speaker 0: but how does the wire get to me if it's not a flat network if it's not all one giant network?

627
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:31,287
Speaker 0: the answer is the router will then do something called ARP.

628
00:45:31,348 --> 00:45:33,801
Speaker 0: this gets a little technical and you can probably just work.

629
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:34,523
Speaker 0: not worry about it.

630
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:39,404
Speaker 0: but just so you know the router will basically say I have got something for 129.21.21.1.

631
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:40,647
Speaker 0: I know you're on this network.

632
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:47,689
Speaker 0: I know you're here and I know you can hear me.

633
00:45:48,131 --> 00:45:51,444
Speaker 0: and it sends this as a broadcast to everyone on the network.

634
00:45:52,327 --> 00:45:57,584
Speaker 0: the computer who has that IP address responds to the MAC address that asked with.

635
00:45:58,246 --> 00:46:02,038
Speaker 0: I am 21.1. you now know my MAC address.

636
00:46:02,238 --> 00:46:05,149
Speaker 0: you can now have a data link with me and send me that data.

637
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:05,671
Speaker 0: yep.

638
00:46:05,752 --> 00:46:06,354
Speaker 1: so check it out.

639
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:08,663
Speaker 1: my my MAC address is secret.

640
00:46:08,723 --> 00:46:09,426
Speaker 1: rim doesn't know it.

641
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,674
Speaker 1: rim I don't know.

642
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:12,779
Speaker 1: I'm looking for rim.

643
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:16,684
Speaker 1: I know his IP address but I don't know that it's rim and I don't know his MAC address either.

644
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:20,121
Speaker 1: but since we're on the same network we're connected to the same hub.

645
00:46:20,684 --> 00:46:21,045
Speaker 1: you know it.

646
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:22,471
Speaker 1: I gotta give it to him.

647
00:46:22,591 --> 00:46:28,035
Speaker 0: there's no other way and he knows that I will hear any conversation on the network so he can broadcast.

648
00:46:28,256 --> 00:46:30,968
Speaker 0: he can shout say anyone answer me.

649
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,735
Speaker 0: I have a question and I'll hear it.

650
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:37,158
Speaker 1: all I know is the IP address I'm looking for and my own MAC address which isn't very helpful.

651
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:39,871
Speaker 1: so I say is there anyone with this IP address?

652
00:46:39,891 --> 00:46:44,249
Speaker 1: I know you're there and rim says that is me and this is my MAC address.

653
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:45,594
Speaker 1: now I know rims MAC address.

654
00:46:45,976 --> 00:46:47,724
Speaker 1: now we forget about the IP addresses.

655
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:49,193
Speaker 1: we do the thing we talked about before.

656
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:50,682
Speaker 1: we just I know his MAC address.

657
00:46:50,702 --> 00:46:54,503
Speaker 1: he knows mine because I told it to him and we I send him whatever he needs to be sent.

658
00:46:54,544 --> 00:46:57,681
Speaker 1: the IP addresses go away once you get to the end of the IP layer.

659
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:00,756
Speaker 0: yep because you see we said you know MAC addresses are unique.

660
00:47:01,078 --> 00:47:01,782
Speaker 0: they can't they're not.

661
00:47:01,863 --> 00:47:06,326
Speaker 0: you'll never have two MAC addresses that are the same on a network outside of one network.

662
00:47:06,768 --> 00:47:09,199
Speaker 0: you could all have every other computer out there.

663
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:10,611
Speaker 0: you don't care what the MAC address is.

664
00:47:10,671 --> 00:47:19,400
Speaker 0: that's why you don't need to know anyone's MAC address ever to connect to them as long as the IP addresses aren't the same yep but you don't know what their IP what their MAC address is.

665
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:25,360
Speaker 0: you only know what the IP address is and IP the networking routing protocol send its.

666
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:27,229
Speaker 0: it makes a way to connect networks.

667
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:34,156
Speaker 0: so your data gets to the network and then in the network that network figures out the MAC address and sends it.

668
00:47:34,578 --> 00:47:43,087
Speaker 0: so there is no way for me in my house to find out the MAC address of anything in Adam's house nor with that information.

669
00:47:43,147 --> 00:47:44,192
Speaker 0: help me at all.

670
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:49,135
Speaker 1: yep to send information between different computer networks you need the IP address.

671
00:47:49,155 --> 00:47:55,625
Speaker 1: that's basically the address of the different networks and once in the network that is supposed to get the stuff gets it.

672
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:58,458
Speaker 1: so someone sends something to my network when I heat.

673
00:47:58,478 --> 00:47:59,543
Speaker 1: they know my IP address.

674
00:47:59,603 --> 00:48:00,848
Speaker 1: I eventually get the goods.

675
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,319
Speaker 1: then I just need the MAC address.

676
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,935
Speaker 1: I don't need this IP address anymore because it's on the right network.

677
00:48:05,996 --> 00:48:16,210
Speaker 0: now now you're probably thinking all right rim and Scott you just said all this but then how come if I'm connecting to a computer on my same network I have to type the IP address and not the MAC address?

678
00:48:16,572 --> 00:48:20,550
Speaker 0: and the answer is because even then it works the exact same way.

679
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:30,922
Speaker 0: your computer goes through the motions and says I have something for this IP address and that's the router and the route and it sends the data to the router and the router says that's right here.

680
00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:36,069
Speaker 0: I'm gonna send this right back where it came from and ask for the MAC address of whose business this is.

681
00:48:36,531 --> 00:48:37,355
Speaker 1: yep you know how you're.

682
00:48:37,536 --> 00:48:40,935
Speaker 1: when you set up your network connection on your computer there's a default gateway.

683
00:48:40,955 --> 00:48:41,740
Speaker 1: you know.

684
00:48:41,941 --> 00:48:57,024
Speaker 1: basically if you're trying to send something on you with your computer to an IP address right if you try to send something to an IP address that's on your network that you're on right now then you can send it to the guy who's there right now.

685
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:01,983
Speaker 0: yep cuz see your computer at all times knows two things about the world.

686
00:49:02,385 --> 00:49:05,176
Speaker 0: it knows what network it is on currently.

687
00:49:05,457 --> 00:49:09,459
Speaker 0: it knows what network it is living in and then it has the default gateway that Scott brought up.

688
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:23,119
Speaker 1: yep and so if an IP address that you're looking for with your computer if your computer will know if that IP address is on the network that you're already on so it'll just send stuff to that IP address and do the whole art thing yep

689
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,667
Speaker 0: it'll it'll do the MAC address thing.

690
00:49:24,707 --> 00:49:27,743
Speaker 0: it won't even ask the router because it knows I'm on this network.

691
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:31,699
Speaker 0: if I try to mail a letter to Scott I know where Scott is.

692
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:32,603
Speaker 0: I just do it here.

693
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:33,688
Speaker 0: I don't tell the router.

694
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:35,979
Speaker 0: I know any mail for Conklin Street.

695
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,345
Speaker 0: I just bring right back here.

696
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:40,318
Speaker 1: yep now the default gateway is what it says.

697
00:49:40,379 --> 00:49:44,836
Speaker 1: it's the default gateway the gateway to the rest of the world the default one.

698
00:49:45,217 --> 00:49:58,905
Speaker 1: so if you ever have something to send somewhere and it's not someone who's right here because you know if it's someone who's right here because it's someone living in your house they're on the same network as you you by default give it to the default gateway.

699
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:01,036
Speaker 1: you say hey you're the default gateway.

700
00:50:01,116 --> 00:50:04,237
Speaker 1: take this and put it on the Internet's because I don't know where it's supposed to go.

701
00:50:04,277 --> 00:50:05,965
Speaker 1: it doesn't go here it goes somewhere else.

702
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:07,412
Speaker 1: you take it now.

703
00:50:07,432 --> 00:50:13,762
Speaker 1: the default gateway is usually like if you have a Wi-Fi router in your house or a cable modem that's your default gateway.

704
00:50:13,842 --> 00:50:14,726
Speaker 1: that little thing right there.

705
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:16,996
Speaker 0: yep and you don't know.

706
00:50:17,016 --> 00:50:20,618
Speaker 0: your computer doesn't know anything about the wide world of the internet out there.

707
00:50:20,638 --> 00:50:29,117
Speaker 0: it does knows is if I don't know where this is I asked that guy and that guy I'll take care of it and that guy doesn't actually know where anything is.

708
00:50:29,197 --> 00:50:35,324
Speaker 0: either in this case he usually sends it to the giant router that your ISP has and that router knows where stuff is.

709
00:50:35,605 --> 00:50:39,442
Speaker 1: yeah there you know most routers that you're going to encounter.

710
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,172
Speaker 1: basically they do the same thing.

711
00:50:42,253 --> 00:50:51,557
Speaker 1: they either it's on this network and we're gonna take care of it right here or it's somewhere else default gateway the routers that actually choose where stuff has to go.

712
00:50:51,577 --> 00:50:57,864
Speaker 1: you will never handle in your life based almost never unless you're working at an ISP or something like that.

713
00:50:58,106 --> 00:50:58,267
Speaker 1: yep

714
00:50:58,569 --> 00:51:11,270
Speaker 0: and the only other thing I'd really like to bring up a little bit because a lot of people don't know what these are and they're a source of great confusion and problems the world round and I'm gonna do this in the most non-technical way possible

715
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:11,914
Speaker 1: the subnet mask.

716
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:14,084
Speaker 0: gonna talk about the subnet mask I'll see it.

717
00:51:14,345 --> 00:51:20,668
Speaker 0: you all see you know IP address subnet mask and not many people know what that subnet mask is.

718
00:51:20,689 --> 00:51:22,377
Speaker 0: and you wonder you know why is it there?

719
00:51:22,598 --> 00:51:23,985
Speaker 0: how come it's always a bunch of 255s?

720
00:51:24,246 --> 00:51:26,417
Speaker 0: yeah well what's the deal there?

721
00:51:26,477 --> 00:51:33,602
Speaker 1: well remember how we just said that your computer knows if an IP address is on this network or some other network.

722
00:51:34,064 --> 00:51:39,507
Speaker 1: the subnet mask is how you figure out if something is on this network or some other network.

723
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:41,838
Speaker 0: now subnet mask used to not be necessary.

724
00:51:41,978 --> 00:51:42,280
Speaker 0: it used to.

725
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,667
Speaker 0: you know they used to break the internet up.

726
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:49,371
Speaker 0: if you look at the IP addresses along those dots no class a was the first dot.

727
00:51:49,391 --> 00:51:51,358
Speaker 0: so any number up to a certain number.

728
00:51:51,378 --> 00:52:01,544
Speaker 0: you knew intrinsically well how big the network was how much of that number described the network and how much of that number described the actual computer in the network.

729
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:06,581
Speaker 0: for example in the the 129 21 21 1 it was a class B network.

730
00:52:06,902 --> 00:52:19,894
Speaker 0: the subnet mask was 255 255 0.0. so effectively the network was 129 dot 21 dot 0.0 and the rest of that number was the computer.

731
00:52:20,335 --> 00:52:21,619
Speaker 0: so the subnet mask.

732
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:28,591
Speaker 0: now the reason the subnet mask seems weird is because you're looking at it in decimal or possibly in hexadecimal.

733
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,077
Speaker 0: that's the only reason.

734
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:38,027
Speaker 0: it looks weird because if you turn that IP address into binary into ones and zeros you'll find that that 255 is.

735
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:41,480
Speaker 0: it fills that part of the number before that dot with all ones.

736
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:53,352
Speaker 0: yep so a subnet mask of 255 255 dot 0.0 says the first two numbers are all ones and the second two numbers are all zeros.

737
00:52:53,955 --> 00:53:08,798
Speaker 0: and when you want to figure out what network you're on you take the IP address which you know could 129.21 to 21.1. so what you essentially do is if you do an and you know we talked about logic a long time ago you do is the first episode of how computers work.

738
00:53:08,939 --> 00:53:11,071
Speaker 0: yeah the one that everyone thought was too complicated.

739
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:17,821
Speaker 0: yeah so to skip all that basically think of it this way if you got ones you pass the data through and keep it.

740
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:19,348
Speaker 0: if you got zeros you ignore it.

741
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:23,124
Speaker 1: so it's like wearing a mask which is why it's called a mask.

742
00:53:23,164 --> 00:53:26,039
Speaker 1: you know let's say you know it's like half of my face.

743
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:32,501
Speaker 1: if it's 255 255 0 0 then the first two 255 are all ones and the second half is all zeros.

744
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:36,541
Speaker 1: so I got a mask covering half of my face and the other half of my face shows through.

745
00:53:36,942 --> 00:53:50,059
Speaker 0: so the 255 255 0 0 subnet mask lets the 129.21 through and gets rid of the 21.1. so now you know I what network you were describing exactly.

746
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,763
Speaker 0: you can take an IP address and with that subnet mask extract the network you are on from it.

747
00:53:55,964 --> 00:53:56,145
Speaker 1: yep.

748
00:53:56,205 --> 00:53:59,219
Speaker 1: so basically you take the subnet mask which is like a mask.

749
00:53:59,259 --> 00:54:06,633
Speaker 1: you are in your face and if I'm looking for an IP address I take that IP address that I'm looking for and I apply it to the subnet mask.

750
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:21,109
Speaker 1: I put this mask over that IP address and I look at the bits left over and by looking at those leftover bits I can tell if it's an if it's an IP address that is on my network or if is an IP address on some other network.

751
00:54:21,671 --> 00:54:26,257
Speaker 1: and if it is on some other network I just send the information to the default gateway cuz he'll take care of it.

752
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,851
Speaker 1: and if it's on my network then I'll take care of it.

753
00:54:29,193 --> 00:54:34,398
Speaker 1: yep and the reason this is important because now I'll tell an anecdote of a messed up subnet mask.

754
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:38,598
Speaker 0: but basically back in the day you know you always broke networks up by the dots.

755
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:50,451
Speaker 0: but now we have something called CIDR which stands for classless inter domain routing and to not bother you with the details it basically means you can break up the networks in places other than the dots.

756
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:54,284
Speaker 0: yep so you could have a subnet mask of 255 255 255 128 holy crap you're crazy.

757
00:54:54,304 --> 00:54:55,046
Speaker 0: and they don't.

758
00:54:55,066 --> 00:55:01,867
Speaker 0: most people don't use that notation anymore.

759
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:03,215
Speaker 0: they use this slash notation.

760
00:55:03,235 --> 00:55:14,269
Speaker 0: so you might see an IP address like 129 21 21 1 slash 24. basically all that number is is the number of ones in that mask.

761
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:25,002
Speaker 0: so if you write the IP address out in binary and then you write that number of ones out in binary and make the rest zeros you can do an operation between those two and get the network out of any IP address.

762
00:55:25,465 --> 00:55:29,144
Speaker 1: yeah here's a tale of a messed up subnet mask to tell you what the problem here is.

763
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:29,405
Speaker 1: right.

764
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:35,615
Speaker 1: so we had this hosting and I configured you know a static IP address which means I had to type in all the information.

765
00:55:36,238 --> 00:55:38,505
Speaker 1: I made a typo while doing the subnet mask.

766
00:55:38,926 --> 00:55:46,905
Speaker 1: it turned out to be 255 000 instead of 255 255. do you know?

767
00:55:47,587 --> 00:55:48,369
Speaker 1: I typed it wrong?

768
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:50,776
Speaker 1: I 255 turned into a zero.

769
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:52,844
Speaker 1: so a bunch of ones were missing.

770
00:55:53,105 --> 00:55:54,030
Speaker 0: so what did this mean?

771
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:54,372
Speaker 0: why?

772
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:55,316
Speaker 0: why is this an issue?

773
00:55:55,376 --> 00:56:01,258
Speaker 1: well what happened was is I think the IP address was like 64 63 or something like that?

774
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:02,141
Speaker 1: yeah it was weird.

775
00:56:02,602 --> 00:56:04,929
Speaker 1: but the point is what happened?

776
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:13,821
Speaker 1: the computer when it would look for an IP address right that had the same like normally I think the IP address of the computer.

777
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:16,450
Speaker 1: let's say it was 64 63 dot whatever.

778
00:56:17,092 --> 00:56:22,809
Speaker 1: okay normally if something else is 64 63 that's on the same network.

779
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:23,331
Speaker 1: right.

780
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:31,277
Speaker 1: this computer because the 255 was zero it thought that anything that began with 64 was the same network.

781
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:33,304
Speaker 1: so I forgot about the 63.

782
00:56:33,304 --> 00:56:33,525
Speaker 0: yep.

783
00:56:33,646 --> 00:56:39,628
Speaker 0: so if there's a 64 out there in the world like 64 dot one right and Scott example dig yep.

784
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:47,358
Speaker 1: so the computer when it would try to contact dig would say all right I'll looking for this 64 65 IP address.

785
00:56:47,378 --> 00:56:48,442
Speaker 1: is that on the same network?

786
00:56:48,744 --> 00:57:08,308
Speaker 1: yes it is when it wasn't because only 64 63 is on the same network not 64 65 and it would try to send it thinking it was right there and it wouldn't send it to the default gateway and the computer was unable to communicate with anything that had an IP address beginning with 64. that was not actually on the same network yep.

787
00:57:08,448 --> 00:57:10,758
Speaker 0: all because the subnet mask was too small.

788
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:15,322
Speaker 0: it was looking at too small a part of the IP address to figure out what network it was on.

789
00:57:15,663 --> 00:57:19,222
Speaker 0: so as a result it thought it was on a much larger network than it really was.

790
00:57:19,262 --> 00:57:24,488
Speaker 1: it's like if you thought your whole house if you thought the address of your whole house was 64 instead of 64 33.

791
00:57:24,488 --> 00:57:31,099
Speaker 0: so if you thought that Bill Gates lived in your house you thought that everyone named Bill lived in your house exact.

792
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,470
Speaker 0: so if you want to call Bob you look in the phone book.

793
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:34,596
Speaker 0: you want to call Bill.

794
00:57:34,616 --> 00:57:38,694
Speaker 0: any bill Bill Gates Bill Watterson bill Pat whoever.

795
00:57:38,895 --> 00:57:44,747
Speaker 0: you just kept yelling their name out and wonder why they don't answer when the only person who actually lived in your house was Bill Jones.

796
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:49,772
Speaker 1: you know and Bill Jones would still get his stuff because you thought he lived in your house and he did.

797
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:52,911
Speaker 1: but Bill Gates you thought he lived in your house and he didn't.

798
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:56,232
Speaker 1: she would never send out his mail and you would thus be unable to communicate with him.

799
00:57:56,674 --> 00:58:02,948
Speaker 1: well I hope I mean we tried to not be technical but it's kind of hard not to when you have all these numbers that are hard to get around.

800
00:58:03,049 --> 00:58:09,363
Speaker 0: yep also the fact that that while the concepts themselves are simple I realized after the fact as I kept you know picturing.

801
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:17,367
Speaker 0: cuz I teach this to people a lot because people always ask and usually we draw pictures that make it so much easier and I realized halfway through that we can't do that.

802
00:58:17,508 --> 00:58:19,540
Speaker 0: no we can't on the internet with a podcast.

803
00:58:19,982 --> 00:58:23,398
Speaker 1: well there are still plenty of websites with plenty of pictures you know.

804
00:58:23,479 --> 00:58:28,537
Speaker 1: I think our goal is to mostly use you know metaphorical examples and such.

805
00:58:28,778 --> 00:58:28,959
Speaker 0: yep.

806
00:58:29,361 --> 00:58:43,740
Speaker 0: however as I've given this disclaimer before if anyone decides to say your metaphor wasn't perfect or whatever cuz I see you doing that to us and we're wrong with you I'll just warn you that we know on a very low level how it works.

807
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:46,311
Speaker 0: I mean I wouldn't know all this shit.

808
00:58:46,572 --> 00:58:48,380
Speaker 1: this is why we're doing a podcast on it.

809
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:54,978
Speaker 1: we're just not explaining all the details and getting everything exactly perfect and everything God because that's what's the point in that?

810
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:55,882
Speaker 0: yeah the thing of this.

811
00:58:56,303 --> 00:59:05,274
Speaker 0: I took two classes at RIT that were basically just how these two layers and the layer above it work and nothing more.

812
00:59:05,495 --> 00:59:11,706
Speaker 1: yep I took one whole class on that and then I took other classes where I had to write software that actually dealt with this shit.

813
00:59:11,726 --> 00:59:19,556
Speaker 0: hell I took a class on exactly how you turn ones and zeros into voltage on a wire and all the different ways to do it.

814
00:59:20,158 --> 00:59:22,305
Speaker 0: yeah craziness I guess.

815
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:31,983
Speaker 0: my question to all of you before we head out for the night was you know we did this in a very non-technical way and we obviously couldn't cover a lot of detail and a lot of interesting things that we kept wanting to talk about.

816
00:59:32,545 --> 00:59:33,911
Speaker 0: are you guys interested in this?

817
00:59:34,293 --> 00:59:38,128
Speaker 1: I would be interesting or was it complicated and boring?

818
00:59:38,149 --> 00:59:46,726
Speaker 0: I would not at all be opposed to doing the same topic with a much higher level of technicality not technicality a much higher technical level.

819
00:59:47,228 --> 00:59:52,897
Speaker 0: however I don't know if there's how many of you would actually care about that or how many of you who would care about it.

820
00:59:53,058 --> 00:59:58,304
Speaker 1: yeah does anyone actually care about how the electricity goes over the wires that the computers understand?

821
00:59:58,545 --> 01:00:06,138
Speaker 0: or do you care how IP addresses really work and how network cards parse them out by doing a binary logic on the subnet masks?

822
01:00:06,198 --> 01:00:19,558
Speaker 0: yeah do you care about like ipv6 because all we've been talking about is ipv4 which is what everyone uses yep or do you care how an ARP really works and what specific like how does a computer know a broadcast from a non broadcast?

823
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:21,627
Speaker 0: or these things called multicast?

824
01:00:21,688 --> 01:00:27,253
Speaker 1: or all the already care about like how a switch does its thing or how a router actually does its thing?

825
01:00:27,273 --> 01:00:29,201
Speaker 1: you know it's complicated stuff.

826
01:00:29,402 --> 01:00:31,970
Speaker 0: yeah basically give us some direction in the forums.

827
01:00:32,111 --> 01:00:42,335
Speaker 0: you know www.frontroadcrew.com as to what you want to hear about networking wise and what level of technical difficulty you want and we can serve it up.

828
01:00:42,396 --> 01:00:45,467
Speaker 0: this is one of the few topics we actually know what we're talking about.

829
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:47,013
Speaker 1: yep all right.

830
01:00:47,655 --> 01:00:49,763
Speaker 0: so come see us at Katsucon.

831
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:55,746
Speaker 1: yeah Katsucon this weekend this weekend in DC yes come see us for awesome.

832
01:00:55,766 --> 01:01:00,150
Speaker 0: we'll be doing awesome the whole time we'll be live in the video game room pretty much any time.

833
01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:01,518
Speaker 0: we're not doing some other event.
