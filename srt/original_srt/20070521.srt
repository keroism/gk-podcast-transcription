1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,058
Speaker 0: It's Monday, May 21st.

2
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:13,382
Speaker 0: I am Scott.

3
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:21,725
Speaker 0: I am rim and this is the geek nights Tonight we tell you how to get into Linux If you are outside of it.

4
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:24,347
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:31,120
Speaker 0: So rim I see this piece of a computer still sitting on the floor here.

6
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:34,452
Speaker 1: Yes, my computer is still in fact not built.

7
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:35,174
Speaker 1: Huh?

8
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:35,957
Speaker 0: Why is that?

9
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:36,660
Speaker 1: well?

10
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:40,056
Speaker 1: The RMA actually just went through today.

11
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:49,840
Speaker 1: so tomorrow They're going to ship back a new identical motherboard to the one that I shipped them But hopefully it's not exactly identical because that means it's non-functioning.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,013
Speaker 1: Well, it's probably going to be the identical model number.

13
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:58,351
Speaker 0: I would assume you could assume But then you might get in trouble.

14
00:00:58,693 --> 00:00:59,959
Speaker 0: I don't know what.

15
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:08,478
Speaker 0: yeah It's just so funny that you spent so many so long you needed a new computer And then you finally break down to get one and then it doesn't go.

16
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:19,380
Speaker 1: honestly I was in the city today And I just stopped by an internet cafe to get online and take care of some business And I saw that they also sell computer components, so I thought I'd edit internet cafe.

17
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:23,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it was an internet cafe slash computer store.

18
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:26,718
Speaker 0: That's pretty cool and weird at the same time.

19
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:31,137
Speaker 1: plus It was two bucks for like an hour and the receipt lasts for I don't know a month or two.

20
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,736
Speaker 0: so oh That's a good deal because usually those places are like 25 cents five minutes.

21
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:39,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, no this is a pretty happening place up in the Bronx near 210th Street.

22
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:43,380
Speaker 1: I forget the name or I'd give them a total plug because they're really cool, but I was looking around.

23
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:46,040
Speaker 1: I saw they had power supplies, and I saw they had some motherboards.

24
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:55,400
Speaker 1: But they didn't have the AB 9 Pro because if they had there's a good chance I would have just bought one right then and just told Newegg to keep the one I sent back and pay the difference.

25
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,791
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd have to pay the restocking fee and such.

26
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,680
Speaker 1: It would have been worth it just to get the computer working.

27
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:00,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess

28
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:09,597
Speaker 1: because a lot of the things that I want to do with the show are Waiting on the new computer because the new computer includes a lot of hard drive space is the thing that

29
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:13,720
Speaker 0: I find funny though Right now that you paid so much for the computer you got it, and it doesn't work.

30
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:16,432
Speaker 0: You're willing to pay more money just to make it work.

31
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:19,078
Speaker 0: if you would have bought the Dell It would have just worked.

32
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,499
Speaker 1: But the Dell has been also spent more money.

33
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:24,934
Speaker 1: The Dell would have cost a lot more money than any of the money.

34
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:26,320
Speaker 1: I would have spent on upgrading.

35
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:32,287
Speaker 1: I know cuz I looked the Dell that costs about $400 more than what I paid for.

36
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:40,215
Speaker 1: this thing is a lot slower and doesn't have a good video card But it just also also is a lot less RAM, but it just works.

37
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:40,817
Speaker 1: not worth it.

38
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:41,640
Speaker 1: It's a piece of crap.

39
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,867
Speaker 1: I'd have to replace half of it.

40
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:44,979
Speaker 0: It'd be fast enough for you.

41
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,229
Speaker 0: You don't really need the whatever extra speed you get and you need it.

42
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,914
Speaker 0: something that works is better than nothing.

43
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:56,000
Speaker 1: now considering all the video I'm probably gonna have to be cross trans coding for challenger on fire.

44
00:02:56,561 --> 00:03:05,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe plus the show which considering that I'm setting up a straight-on filter macro That's gonna pretty much automatically do most of my editing.

45
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,880
Speaker 1: for me that all told will take a while unless the computer's really fast.

46
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:12,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually kind of want your computer to just got freaking work already.

47
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,600
Speaker 0: So I want to see like how that Ubuntu studio works, and I want to see just how fast it is and all that.

48
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,780
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm really looking forward to it.

49
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,599
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have at least four on what I have at work is stupid fast, so this has to be stupider.

50
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:25,405
Speaker 1: fast I'm gonna have an Ubuntu.

51
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:26,831
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have an Ubuntu studio.

52
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:29,160
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have a Gentoo, and I'm probably ever windows.

53
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:33,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh yeah, so get this speaking of Ubuntu's and Gentoo's right.

54
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:43,547
Speaker 0: so yes if you use some Linux distribution such as Gentoo right when a new version of the Linux kernel comes out Let's say to 621 comes out.

55
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:50,048
Speaker 0: then if you're currently using to 620 you have the opportunity to upgrade to 2621. that's how Gentoo works.

56
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:53,140
Speaker 0: You just constantly upgrading everything all the time including the kernel.

57
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:57,919
Speaker 1: It's really easy to do contrary to popular belief, but it's not easy to know how to do it.

58
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,599
Speaker 0: Yes It's once you know learn how it's done.

59
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,347
Speaker 0: Then you can do it many times.

60
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:10,533
Speaker 1: basically just make a couple files put them in the right places make sure they're pointed at By other things make sure the configuring is the part That's actually that's tricky that you have to learn.

61
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:11,720
Speaker 0: the rest of it is just a simple.

62
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:15,259
Speaker 1: If you have trouble with that when in doubt turn it on.

63
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:21,427
Speaker 0: Not really no, but basically, uh Ubuntu doesn't do it like that.

64
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:29,001
Speaker 0: the way Ubuntu works is if you are using say Edgy F. All right, you will always have kernel 2617.

65
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:43,080
Speaker 0: You will never get 2618 or 2619 or 2620 you'll always have 2617. furthermore You'll have the 2617 that they made yes, and they might upgrade the 2617 to a better 2617.

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:52,350
Speaker 0: You know if there's a bug in it or something they'll patch that bug But they will never give you the new features in 2618 or 19 or anything else And they will never upgrade you to the newer kernel.

67
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,360
Speaker 1: now there are plenty of good reasons for this.

68
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,331
Speaker 0: There's plenty of good reasons.

69
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:56,080
Speaker 0: They do it that way.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,581
Speaker 0: It's not just.

71
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:57,604
Speaker 0: they're not stupid or anything.

72
00:04:57,624 --> 00:05:02,077
Speaker 0: there's reasons, but in feisty you get 2620. all right.

73
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:05,468
Speaker 0: the newest kernel is 2621 so that's not too bad.

74
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:07,016
Speaker 0: give you using 2620.

75
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:07,960
Speaker 1: no no not at all.

76
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:09,608
Speaker 0: It's not is really nothing to worry about.

77
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:17,680
Speaker 0: unless you have a laptop That's somewhat modern because in 2621 they have added two important new features to the kernel.

78
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,049
Speaker 0: No, HZ and some IRQ balance something.

79
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:30,399
Speaker 0: basically if you use kernel 2621 configured properly on a laptop That is modern you can save a lot of electricity and increase your battery life many fold.

80
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:33,620
Speaker 0: Probably I could probably get another hour out of this thing with a newer kernel.

81
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:45,434
Speaker 0: That's how big a deal it is, but because I'm using Ubuntu feisty phone I can't get 2621 unless I do it by myself Say Scott wouldn't it be great if there were an easier way to do that in Ubuntu?

82
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:47,542
Speaker 0: gee you know there would be and you Know what.

83
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:49,251
Speaker 0: well there was an easier way.

84
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:52,488
Speaker 0: at least it was relatively easy Mostly because I know how to do that sort of thing.

85
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:57,549
Speaker 0: so I went and I got the source code to 2621 And I built it and I put it in there and it worked.

86
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,532
Speaker 0: then I realized something hey this kernel It doesn't have my wireless stuff in it.

87
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:05,620
Speaker 1: this kind of is making me thirsty.

88
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:15,519
Speaker 0: So I was saving all this battery power But my wireless network card wasn't working because apparently I was using the default kernel sources from kernel.org.

89
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:20,180
Speaker 0: And of course the Ubuntu kernel is not just this kernel source from kernel.org.

90
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:25,620
Speaker 0: The Ubuntu people put a bunch of patches and stuff in there including the stuff that makes my wireless card work.

91
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean even in Gentoo you get some patches because there are patches that aren't really part of the bare kernel that yeah are really Important or very good.

92
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,312
Speaker 0: That's basically how you add stuff to the kernel that isn't already in there.

93
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:43,552
Speaker 0: by default is you take other source code And you kind of patch it in and then you can enable more options and whatever.

94
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:54,797
Speaker 0: so the default Linux kernel from kernel.org that Linus Torvalds and those people released does not have the stuff to make my wireless card work and the Ubuntu people are So nice they put it in there for me.

95
00:06:55,422 --> 00:07:00,939
Speaker 0: But if I want a newer kernel the Ubuntu people aren't going to do that for me And I have to go get that wireless stuff myself.

96
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:17,160
Speaker 0: now I know how to do it, but it's a huge pain in the ass a huge pain it's not even worth it, so I'm basically going to suffer with shittier battery life and Working wireless until gutsy gibbon comes out because my other option is to switch distributions.

97
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:30,893
Speaker 0: Well, it's either stay where I am suffer a pain in the ass switch distributions to something like Gentoo which is also a pain in the ass or I don't know what God the thing is I really like Gentoo.

98
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:37,400
Speaker 1: when Scott convinced me to try it way back I really liked it, and I learned a lot in a real big hurry about how Linux works.

99
00:07:37,481 --> 00:08:07,458
Speaker 1: I also like I didn't learn as much as Scott partly because we started doing the show and I had other things going on and my Computer was slow and it took four days to recompile X. Yeah, so after a while I stopped playing with things and remaking my Gentoo But even so I really like Gentoo because I've optimized it with the little that I knew to the point that my one gigahertz Thunderbird here is Stupidly faster than the much much actually faster hardware in the other computer.

100
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:08,060
Speaker 1: I have sitting next.

101
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,340
Speaker 0: Yes, however it took a great deal of time, which we don't have and it also not just time to build.

102
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,529
Speaker 1: I mean no OS to take four days to compile.

103
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:17,815
Speaker 1: that wasn't really that bad.

104
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:22,010
Speaker 1: the problem is Every time you update Gentoo something breaks.

105
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,676
Speaker 1: you might not notice right away, but something breaks you have to find it You have to fix it.

106
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,917
Speaker 0: Yeah Also you you didn't actually go through the trouble of like the by default.

107
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:38,880
Speaker 0: if you install Ubuntu There's a whole bunch of things they do for you like if you plug in a USB thumb drive It'll just work and mount automatically and all that sort of stuff.

108
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, now you have to.

109
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,736
Speaker 0: you have to set that kind of automatic functionality up yourself.

110
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:44,859
Speaker 0: It's not just done for you.

111
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:45,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I did.

112
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:47,480
Speaker 0: you didn't bother to do any of that shit.

113
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,960
Speaker 1: Well, I did get that working until my USB stopped working physically.

114
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:54,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there are a lot of other things you didn't get working all the way.

115
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:55,180
Speaker 1: I didn't bother with you dev.

116
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:59,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, you didn't bother like setting up special like also configurations.

117
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:04,720
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't really need to because you just use you know one stereo output normal.

118
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,608
Speaker 0: Yes, cuz I don't want stereo input.

119
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:09,400
Speaker 1: I've always I really haven't jumped on to the whole.

120
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:16,480
Speaker 0: You didn't enable like like the d mix type of stuff that allows different programs to all play sound at the same time with OSS.

121
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:20,240
Speaker 1: Also, yeah, the only reason I didn't do that is that think about that.

122
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:32,456
Speaker 0: That's that's the perfect thing for people to understand here in gen 2. right by default if you don't do anything You cannot have two programs play sound out of the same sound card at the same time.

123
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:33,880
Speaker 0: You have to set that up.

124
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,605
Speaker 0: That's the level of setting up.

125
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,328
Speaker 0: We're talking about.

126
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:38,174
Speaker 1: the worst part is with also.

127
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:39,980
Speaker 1: at least that was easy and it worked right away.

128
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:41,739
Speaker 1: I set my also pretty damn well.

129
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:49,879
Speaker 1: Yep with the OSS which the old flash was using I had a few issues Yeah a few and I gave up because it wasn't worth it.

130
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:53,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the point is Ubuntu does a lot of those things for you.

131
00:09:53,816 --> 00:10:12,493
Speaker 1: Yep, actually That's why I'm really really excited about this Ubuntu studio and I really want to play with it because even if I don't use it the kernel that they make for it is Generally in Ubuntu kernel except that it has low latency patches Which I don't really want to bother Applying myself and I don't really want to make my own kernel.

132
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,881
Speaker 1: and if they've made it already Then I'm although I'm on board I think.

133
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:25,159
Speaker 0: other than that it appears to me that the only difference between a bunch of studio and Ubuntu besides the low latency kernel Is that by default it comes with a bunch of?

134
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,620
Speaker 0: Multimedia production applications already installed like, you know the game and the our door and the center Lara.

135
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks like they also make it real easy to make Jack work and a bunch of stuff.

136
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,707
Speaker 1: I still have to look into it.

137
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:38,452
Speaker 1: I haven't really.

138
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,580
Speaker 0: they also change the theme.

139
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:42,980
Speaker 0: Actually that I want to steal the theme from it because it looks really nice.

140
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:54,172
Speaker 0: It's a dark theme that doesn't screw up your computer, which is rare for GTK Basically because the Firefox if it is pretty much just Ubuntu with a few changes I'm probably gonna run it instead of Ubuntu.

141
00:10:54,253 --> 00:11:00,413
Speaker 1: That's probably a good idea for you And if it's not or if there's anything fishy I'm probably going to steal its kernel and then run Ubuntu with it.

142
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:01,176
Speaker 0: You can do that.

143
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:04,210
Speaker 1: if that works That'll probably be a lot easier than making my own.

144
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:04,612
Speaker 0: Yep.

145
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:05,537
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

146
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:06,160
Speaker 0: All right.

147
00:11:06,722 --> 00:11:10,073
Speaker 0: So I was reading some news is on the internet and usually I ignore.

148
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:16,891
Speaker 0: most of the science news is because the science news is Tend to be medical study blabbity-blah outer space blabbity-blah.

149
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:21,785
Speaker 1: There's been a lot of very interesting quantum mechanics news lately Yeah, or stuff like that.

150
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:23,009
Speaker 0: I don't understand this at all.

151
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:31,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically when I read those articles half the time, it's Wow I'm sure that what I'm reading is very relevant to the modern world and very interesting to other people.

152
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:36,480
Speaker 0: Yes, but here's the science news that I understand And is very awesome.

153
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:42,440
Speaker 0: Basically, they invented a new kind of plastic that both attracts and repels water.

154
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,246
Speaker 0: It is hydrophobic and hydrophilic but not just hydrophobic and hydrophilic super hydrophobic and super Hydrophilic.

155
00:11:50,789 --> 00:12:03,619
Speaker 0: now this has a lot of applications but what I thought was really cool is the number one application they seem to talk about the most in the article is Collecting water for people in the desert in Africa and other such places and I'm like, huh?

156
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,223
Speaker 0: Collecting water.

157
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:16,100
Speaker 0: apparently there's a lot of places in the desert in Africa and other deserts I think where there are desert fogs and they collect water from the desert fogs was sort of like these meshes and the water.

158
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:25,869
Speaker 1: I actually had a survival guide From when I was a Cub Scout and it described in the desert how to make one of those meshes and then drain water out Into a bucket at the bottom.

159
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:27,020
Speaker 0: Oh, that's pretty cool.

160
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:39,820
Speaker 0: Yeah well Apparently if using this plastic what you could do is you can make a strip of the plastic Where the top part of it was hydrophobic hydrophilic and the bottom was hydrophobic.

161
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:44,002
Speaker 0: So the top part would attract all the water from the fog Right.

162
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:53,837
Speaker 0: and then as that water like, you know as it got became fully saturated and the water dripped down to the bottom Where the hydrophobic strip was it would fall off immediately a hundred percent.

163
00:12:53,857 --> 00:13:00,178
Speaker 0: if it would fall off I wouldn't have any water sticking to the plastic and you could collect that water in it, whatever and drink it.

164
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,317
Speaker 0: and Basically, you could get many many many more waters out of the fog than you could using the current method.

165
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:17,428
Speaker 0: and there are many other applications of this thing for example like chemistry labs and things and medical tests and Medical equipments and all sorts of stuff.

166
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,400
Speaker 1: Those are probably the vaguest possible ideas.

167
00:13:20,822 --> 00:13:22,511
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I could even imagine it though.

168
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,200
Speaker 0: Like I'm in a chemistry lab, right?

169
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,460
Speaker 0: You know you deal like a test tube and you clean it and then there's always like some water still in there.

170
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:40,800
Speaker 0: Or like you you put in exactly X milliliters of water and then X milliliters of a chemical and you stir it up and you heat it or something in a chemistry Lab and then you pour it out of the test tube into something else and then there's always some left in there.

171
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:42,852
Speaker 0: So now you're like how much is left in there?

172
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:44,020
Speaker 0: Maybe like two drops?

173
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:44,843
Speaker 0: How much is that?

174
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,690
Speaker 0: Is that gonna throw my measurement off?

175
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:49,320
Speaker 0: and it always throws your measurement off by some decimals, whatever.

176
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:53,739
Speaker 0: What if your little test tube was made of this super hydrophobic plastic, right?

177
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:56,191
Speaker 0: Look all of it came out 100%.

178
00:13:56,191 --> 00:14:02,220
Speaker 0: see luckily do a lot more accurate Chemistry lab things even in just like lame-ass high school chemistry lab.

179
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:09,830
Speaker 1: That was never a concern for me mostly because I got in trouble in chemistry for getting bored one day and silvering all of my glass wear.

180
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:11,387
Speaker 0: Awesome.

181
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:14,182
Speaker 1: It took me about two hours Awesome.

182
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:20,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, this these new inventions of cool hydrophobic and hydrophilic plastics are pretty awesome.

183
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:22,595
Speaker 0: Oh think about a fog free windshield.

184
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:29,011
Speaker 1: Ah Free eyeglasses, I'm thinking mostly about ski goggles because there you go.

185
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:32,100
Speaker 1: even back when I skied no matter how fancy women goggles.

186
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:32,982
Speaker 1: Forget that.

187
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,088
Speaker 1: swimming goggles are for losers and professionals.

188
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:36,311
Speaker 0: That's right for the professionals.

189
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:39,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you were thinking for you astronaut helmets.

190
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:43,400
Speaker 1: I don't know if they have a problem with song with diving helmets.

191
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:57,051
Speaker 1: See, I remember skiing as a kid and no matter how expensive they were whatever I got to put on my face it would either immediately scratch up and you couldn't see through it because The thing that made the fog not appear also made it really scratch.

192
00:14:57,352 --> 00:15:04,573
Speaker 1: non proof to go about to say that in a very far Way, yep, or it would fog up and I couldn't see LCD screen.

193
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:06,620
Speaker 0: Maybe like wouldn't that keep all the water off?

194
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,970
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know what water I don't know.

195
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:12,665
Speaker 1: You shouldn't be getting water on your LCD I know nothing's.

196
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:16,960
Speaker 0: maybe you could make though a waterproof laptop because it would basically just expel all water.

197
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,716
Speaker 1: If only I could make a finger proof LCD, that would be awesome.

198
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:24,579
Speaker 0: Alright, so yeah Plastic, you should read about it.

199
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:35,640
Speaker 1: I guess it just proves once again our theory not our theory but our our basic idea that Science is always making the world better and most problems can be solved by the direct application of science.

200
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:38,148
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure all the problems can be solved by so.

201
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:42,100
Speaker 0: well, there is one possibly have to have a broad broad definition of science.

202
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:42,463
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

203
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:44,257
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying there's one possible exception.

204
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:46,785
Speaker 0: Maybe Yeah, yeah.

205
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:50,960
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is we might not be able to solve the problem.

206
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:56,368
Speaker 0: But you know if it's a problem that is solvable then Science is the way to solve it.

207
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:56,710
Speaker 0: No.

208
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,011
Speaker 0: Yeah,

209
00:15:57,473 --> 00:16:15,753
Speaker 1: so with all these computers We've been using and building and all this technology for the past 20 years or so Every now and then you see articles they come and go always in clusters about the issues of dealing with all the waste from computer products and it's really not a trivial issue despite the fact that It's not often in the media.

210
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:21,820
Speaker 1: and when it is in the media It's only there for a flash and then California passes some sort of law and then it disappears again.

211
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:30,220
Speaker 0: Yeah people always talk about how like You know motherboards is like so much poison gas and dispose of it because it basically is just a board made of poison gas.

212
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, computer components are incredibly toxic, especially when you collect them in mass.

213
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:48,722
Speaker 0: Yeah There's a lot of places that will basically collect old computers and take all the pieces and to make new computers Not new but functioning computers and then give them out install Linux on them and give them out to people who don't have computers and well stuff like that.

214
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:57,371
Speaker 1: according to foreign policy currently there is 17 times more gold in computer waste per unit weight.

215
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:04,671
Speaker 1: then in gold or And there there's 40 times more copper than in copper.

216
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:12,480
Speaker 0: or well, maybe we should Get the gold and the copper out and not let the poison gas get out.

217
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:13,239
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

218
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,502
Speaker 1: It just so happens that that exact is exactly what has been going on in the world for a long time Which is good.

219
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:21,353
Speaker 1: It is going on in China, which is bad.

220
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,018
Speaker 0: Why China's collecting gold?

221
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:23,579
Speaker 0: What's wrong with that?

222
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,954
Speaker 1: No, because what's happening is they're collecting.

223
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:44,985
Speaker 1: it's not just China It's a lot of third third world or developing or basically non Western industrialized nations That are taking all of this waste in mass Gigantic amounts of it paying people practically nothing to sort it and deal with it and run the machines poisoning Horribly the atmosphere

224
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,289
Speaker 0: and gas get

225
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:46,610
Speaker 1: out.

226
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:49,240
Speaker 1: They're letting the poison gas get out particularly there don't they know?

227
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,510
Speaker 0: It's like the first rule of computers.

228
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,820
Speaker 0: You don't let the magic smoke get out.

229
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,222
Speaker 0: What do you think?

230
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:53,853
Speaker 0: the magic smoke is people it's poison.

231
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,020
Speaker 1: See the thing is in China.

232
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,725
Speaker 0: That's what makes computers work poison gas.

233
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:57,387
Speaker 1: They don't?

234
00:17:57,488 --> 00:17:59,534
Speaker 1: they just don't have to care about that.

235
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:01,400
Speaker 1: There aren't as many environmental regulations.

236
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:02,217
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

237
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:09,000
Speaker 0: You know, it doesn't really bother me but they're gonna be pretty sorry if you're sitting there taking gold out of a computer.

238
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:12,428
Speaker 0: It's sort of like Indiana Jones He takes a statue and then a rock rolls him over.

239
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:16,518
Speaker 0: these people they're gonna take gold out of this old computer and then a poison Gas will kill them.

240
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:18,350
Speaker 1: well The worst part is they deserve.

241
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:25,560
Speaker 1: because of the way these industries Run the people actually doing the work and being poisoned and living near the factory are not the ones profiting.

242
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,125
Speaker 1: They're being paid practically nothing.

243
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:28,729
Speaker 0: Oh, they're problem.

244
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:39,520
Speaker 1: I Remains that the amount of computer waste and technology waste that the United States alone is producing is growing at a startling rate.

245
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:42,959
Speaker 1: And yet the only solution we have so far is to ship it to China.

246
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:44,903
Speaker 0: I don't know.

247
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:45,345
Speaker 0: I don't see.

248
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:48,699
Speaker 0: I think what we should do is we should scrape all the gold off and then send to China.

249
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:55,650
Speaker 1: Uh, the process of scraping the gold off to do it Well is very expensive and you don't scrape it off using solvents.

250
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,656
Speaker 0: Does it cost more than the gold?

251
00:18:57,676 --> 00:18:59,060
Speaker 0: it slightly.

252
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:00,023
Speaker 0: But then why?

253
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:01,066
Speaker 0: how is China profiting?

254
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:05,760
Speaker 1: because they don't have to worry about safety or regulation or people.

255
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:12,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we should Should what find a way to make it profitable?

256
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:15,540
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, even if it is profitable It's always more profitable to do it in China.

257
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:18,520
Speaker 1: And if anyone does it here, they can't compete with the people in China.

258
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,859
Speaker 0: I guess if you had a machine that did it with no people.

259
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:24,779
Speaker 1: But even then it still generates horrible waste you can make.

260
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:27,840
Speaker 0: well You just put the horrible waste in a barrel and put it with the nuclear waste.

261
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:30,460
Speaker 1: But we don't even store the nuclear waste anywhere.

262
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:34,436
Speaker 1: It's all still sitting at the nuclear power plant about that another day.

263
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:35,139
Speaker 0: Why that is?

264
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:37,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, I believe there's a forum thread about that right now.

265
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:44,962
Speaker 1: There might be Suffice to say it's an interesting and complex issue that we would probably have to spend at least a whole show to actually cover in Any depth.

266
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:48,635
Speaker 0: someone should sell a home kit where you can collect the gold out of your old computer.

267
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:49,800
Speaker 1: It's not that easy.

268
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,435
Speaker 1: it's Having worked at IBM in a factory where we kind of did the reverse and put the gold on.

269
00:19:56,817 --> 00:20:00,473
Speaker 1: I can say that it is Not easy to put the gold on let alone to take the gold off.

270
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:01,880
Speaker 0: Oh, I'll leave the gold on us.

271
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,684
Speaker 0: Take the platinum back.

272
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:04,211
Speaker 1: There's not so much platinum.

273
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:05,778
Speaker 0: That sucks that wants it.

274
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:15,249
Speaker 1: then things of the day.

275
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:22,444
Speaker 1: Now I wasn't so much a fan of the show at least not as much as Scott But the Jetsons at least has to be respected for being popular.

276
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:27,286
Speaker 0: at when it was on TV Yeah, I mean, I didn't really think about the Jetsons that much.

277
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,355
Speaker 0: but when I was a kid I watched it and I liked it.

278
00:20:29,636 --> 00:20:32,307
Speaker 0: and now that rim found it a bit of it.

279
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:34,155
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, yeah I remember that I like that.

280
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:34,557
Speaker 1: Yep.

281
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:35,381
Speaker 1: Let me as a kid.

282
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:44,630
Speaker 1: I always preferred the Flintstones And above that I always preferred my Nintendo, but oh, yeah, of course, of course, but yeah, I don't know Flintstones or Jetsons.

283
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,273
Speaker 0: It's tough.

284
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:46,419
Speaker 1: What about the movie?

285
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:47,183
Speaker 0: I didn't.

286
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:48,148
Speaker 0: the movie was done.

287
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:48,610
Speaker 0: them sucks.

288
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,379
Speaker 1: Yeah when they meet it wasn't so bad.

289
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:57,310
Speaker 0: It sucked wasn't any worse than any of the shows I think I like like Dino and Barney Rubble better than I like any Jetsons characters.

290
00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:01,207
Speaker 0: But the plots of the Jetsons episodes, I think I like better.

291
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,381
Speaker 1: Yeah I like Cogswell.

292
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:06,637
Speaker 1: I like Cogswell was my man.

293
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:12,746
Speaker 0: Well, the only problem was basically he was awesome Except when his wife pundit he needed if he stood up to the wife.

294
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:13,570
Speaker 0: you've been in the best ever.

295
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,955
Speaker 1: He was a dick though.

296
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:17,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if anything he should have fired George cuz.

297
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:20,957
Speaker 1: George was a terrible worker Should have but didn't.

298
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:26,477
Speaker 1: what really bothered me was that George's job was just to push that button Which he couldn't even manage to do that half the time.

299
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:26,939
Speaker 1: Yep.

300
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,463
Speaker 1: Just use a drinking bird.

301
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:29,987
Speaker 1: Homer Simpson figured that out.

302
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:30,850
Speaker 0: Yep.

303
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:41,443
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is a little Family Guy spoof and Normally, I don't go for this sort of thing as a thing of the day But it's just the opener to the Jetsons until the last second.

304
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, totally caught me by surprise.

305
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,330
Speaker 0: I thought it was something someone on YouTube put together and not something that was actually put together by Family Guy.

306
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,917
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wasn't sure what was going on.

307
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:54,016
Speaker 1: The joke was kind of worth it kind of like that other one where they made fun Of Amadeus.

308
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:01,665
Speaker 0: Yeah suddenly at the end All right, I got this thing of the day here and I kind of like the thing.

309
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:03,110
Speaker 0: but I looked at the website.

310
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:07,150
Speaker 0: It's on and I don't like this website cuz it's really yeah.

311
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:14,414
Speaker 0: But anyway the thing I'll only talk about the thing the thing is 15 useless or even dangerous eyesight myths.

312
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:26,975
Speaker 0: and I'm just gonna go off the myths real quick because I think some of these are pretty interesting because some of These I believe some of these I knew I know a lot of people believe these and I checked up on these seem to be Actually mythical.

313
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,189
Speaker 0: so all the information here seems to be correct as far as I can tell.

314
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:33,810
Speaker 0: Number one sitting too close to the television will damage your vision.

315
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:38,749
Speaker 0: Okay, all of these are false by the way, so sitting close to the TV does not damage your vision.

316
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:42,628
Speaker 0: Reading in the dark does not damage your eyesight.

317
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:46,218
Speaker 0: Some eye exercises can improve your vision.

318
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:47,240
Speaker 0: That is also false.

319
00:22:47,862 --> 00:22:51,210
Speaker 0: You cannot wear your eyes out by using them too much.

320
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:57,441
Speaker 0: Ah Vision does not improve in older people as they gain second sight.

321
00:22:57,662 --> 00:23:02,539
Speaker 1: what that actually is apparently is I know all about that You tend to become farsighted as you get older.

322
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,910
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's that there's something with cataracts.

323
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,049
Speaker 0: We're at a certain stage.

324
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:11,790
Speaker 0: It actually changes your vision in a way where you can see better and then it's actually the cataract advancing.

325
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:17,110
Speaker 1: Ah, well, there's also a thing where if you're near-sighted you tend to be farsighted when you get older.

326
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:20,590
Speaker 1: So as you become farsighted, it slowly corrects your near-sightedness.

327
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:25,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, too much sex, especially magic masturbation cannot make you go blind.

328
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,366
Speaker 0: Wearing poorly fit glasses will not damage your eyes.

329
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:31,695
Speaker 1: It just hurts Yep, and makes you nauseous.

330
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:35,910
Speaker 0: blind people do not have a sixth sense or extraordinary talent.

331
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,990
Speaker 1: Actually, there is a lot of evidence that blind people have exceptional hearing.

332
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:50,130
Speaker 0: Well, what it is apparently is that you know, if you didn't if you actually you know Closed your eyes all the time and you were using only your hearing you would practice it a lot.

333
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you would.

334
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:55,450
Speaker 0: it's not that they have innately, you know, DNA better hearing or anything like that.

335
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,156
Speaker 1: Well, no one argued that.

336
00:23:57,176 --> 00:23:58,661
Speaker 0: I know it's that's.

337
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:03,097
Speaker 0: all they're saying here is that they don't have Intrinsically better hearing.

338
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:04,808
Speaker 0: is that they use their hearing more.

339
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:06,468
Speaker 0: thus They're better at hearing than you.

340
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:11,510
Speaker 0: But there's no reason you couldn't hear as well as a blind person if you practiced it just as much as they do.

341
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:18,221
Speaker 1: Well, I did read somewhere that a lot of the parts of the brain that work for vision end up being co-opted by Hearing and other things.

342
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:23,050
Speaker 1: Yes, so You'd have to permanently blind yourself to get that level of ability.

343
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:28,650
Speaker 0: Yes, but you could get pretty close especially if you close your eyes a lot and listen to a lot of things very carefully.

344
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:29,232
Speaker 1: I don't know.

345
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:32,225
Speaker 1: I guess we'll have to do a double blind study.

346
00:24:32,245 --> 00:24:38,332
Speaker 0: Oh There is a need to have your vision checked before you turn 40.

347
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:39,822
Speaker 0: Everyone should go to the eye doctor.

348
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:47,452
Speaker 1: Even if your eyes are fine you might have glaucoma might have it because glaucoma is pretty much symptomless until ah Shit, I'm lying.

349
00:24:47,492 --> 00:24:48,774
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've all popped.

350
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:50,477
Speaker 0: glaucoma is basically nothing.

351
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:50,818
Speaker 0: Nothing.

352
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:51,158
Speaker 0: Nothing.

353
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:51,459
Speaker 0: Nothing.

354
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:57,308
Speaker 0: eyes explode and We're I think we're relatively higher risk for that than other people looking at screens all day.

355
00:24:57,689 --> 00:25:02,970
Speaker 1: Yep Yep, plus I actually used to get tested for that a lot and I still continue to get tested for it every couple years.

356
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:12,210
Speaker 1: Also for any of you who hate the glaucoma test because it basically they put a Gun in front of your eyeball and you have to hold your eye open.

357
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:19,288
Speaker 1: Well, they shoot a blast of air into it And if you blink they do it again and again and again and again.

358
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:22,262
Speaker 0: They'd hold your eyelid open with a little thing cuz.

359
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:23,367
Speaker 1: that's kind of hard to set up.

360
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:26,863
Speaker 1: Okay Well, apparently they don't test for it that way anymore.

361
00:25:27,345 --> 00:25:28,390
Speaker 1: Ah, I don't know.

362
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,970
Speaker 1: I haven't been tested since the new way was used around here, but I hear there's a new way.

363
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:36,014
Speaker 0: Alright doctors cannot transplant eyes Not yet.

364
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:37,159
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's correct.

365
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:39,790
Speaker 0: Scientists have not created a bionic eye.

366
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:41,717
Speaker 0: Well, they kind of have.

367
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:44,589
Speaker 0: yes, they but it's like you can see some dots of light.

368
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:46,396
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I can't freakin see see.

369
00:25:46,597 --> 00:25:47,179
Speaker 1: well not yet.

370
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:55,810
Speaker 1: But the thing is someday we are going to have that because already Prototypes and ways of doing that sort of thing kind of work and it's getting better every day.

371
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:58,761
Speaker 0: It is harmful to look at the Sun.

372
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:02,437
Speaker 0: even if you squint or use sunglasses Do not look at the Sun.

373
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,170
Speaker 0: if you look at the Sun you can blind yourself in like less than a minute.

374
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:08,260
Speaker 0: Yep, I don't know who even if it's an eclipse.

375
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:10,829
Speaker 0: It's it don't look at the Sun god damn it.

376
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:15,882
Speaker 0: There is something you can do to prevent vision loss.

377
00:26:16,063 --> 00:26:17,167
Speaker 0: go to the eye doctor.

378
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:17,949
Speaker 0: do what they say.

379
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:28,142
Speaker 1: Actually, there's a cool study about how apparently putting atropine drops in kids eyes if the kids are starting to get myopia Will prevent the myopia from progressing.

380
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:29,530
Speaker 0: Oh, that's interesting.

381
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:33,524
Speaker 1: yeah, really interesting and I really want to see more follow-up on.

382
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:38,036
Speaker 0: that won't help me but Yep, and the last two myths.

383
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:40,483
Speaker 0: although glasses make you see better.

384
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:43,130
Speaker 0: They do not make vision get worse over time.

385
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:55,570
Speaker 1: There was a friend of our family when I was a kid who for many years after they realized that one of their children had Vision problems didn't get this child glasses because they were afraid that it would make the vision worse over time.

386
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:58,150
Speaker 1: So the kid had to suffer with not being able to see crap.

387
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:12,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically what happens is before you get glasses you see this blurry world And that's what you're used to and then you put glasses on and now the world is correct again When you take the glasses off and you see that shit same shitty blurry world from before.

388
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,070
Speaker 0: It's so much worse because you're now comparing it to be correct world.

389
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,444
Speaker 1: Well, not only that but once you start wearing glasses your vision usually continues to degrade.

390
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:23,590
Speaker 1: so you keep needing stronger and stronger glass.

391
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:26,119
Speaker 0: Yes, but your vision is not degrading because of the glasses.

392
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:42,590
Speaker 1: It's kind of like how a lot of parents of autistic children Well, I guess not a lot because these are just the wacko minority nut jobs They think that vaccines cause the autism When it just so happens that the symptoms of autism tend to come about right around the age that kids get all their vaccines.

393
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:54,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the final myth post hoc non ergo, dr Hawk eating carrots will improve your vision and okay Basically, it is true that carrots are high in vitamin A which is an essential vitamin for seeing.

394
00:27:54,969 --> 00:28:07,215
Speaker 0: however You don't need that much like a carrot every day or two is enough Vitamin A to see properly out that if you eat too much vitamin A like a vitamin A tablet that could be harmful I believe.

395
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:08,622
Speaker 1: correct me if I'm wrong.

396
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:10,050
Speaker 1: Not that you know, but I don't know either.

397
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:13,370
Speaker 1: I think vitamin A is the most toxic vitamin for humans.

398
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:17,248
Speaker 1: It might be because I have read of a lot of cases of vitamin A poisoning.

399
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:20,849
Speaker 1: Yep You just need like what is one of those fat soluble ones?

400
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,320
Speaker 0: You just need some vitamin A and then you can see just fine.

401
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:30,247
Speaker 0: eating like a vitamin A tablet isn't suddenly gonna give you like X-ray visions or let you see like a mile away.

402
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:31,651
Speaker 0: Yeah It's.

403
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:33,919
Speaker 0: you only need like a carrot once in a while.

404
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,505
Speaker 0: You know, you feed salad with carrot.

405
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:36,087
Speaker 0: You're all right.

406
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:36,950
Speaker 0: It's cool.

407
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:48,350
Speaker 1: so we haven't done this for a while partly because honestly the only reason we had theme weeks Was to force ourselves to have some show ideas or to otherwise get us out of some sort of slump.

408
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:50,639
Speaker 1: We never really used them proactively.

409
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:51,201
Speaker 1: Yeah.

410
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,329
Speaker 0: Well here comes a theme week watch out.

411
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:55,530
Speaker 1: And we actually planned this one.

412
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,342
Speaker 1: We actually are kind of excited about it because

413
00:28:57,623 --> 00:29:02,490
Speaker 0: it's one of those theme weeks We came up with a long time ago and somehow never did even though we probably should have a long time

414
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:08,290
Speaker 1: Yep, and then it came up in the forums again about one of the geekeries and how to get into it.

415
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,948
Speaker 1: So we decided alright, it's time.

416
00:29:10,412 --> 00:29:16,117
Speaker 0: Especially I think is something we waited because this is sort of an important theme week And I think now we can do it justice.

417
00:29:16,418 --> 00:29:16,599
Speaker 1: Yep.

418
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,606
Speaker 1: So to this week's theme.

419
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:26,390
Speaker 1: every night this week We're going to talk about how to get into it how to get into some sort of geekery or hobby or whatever thing We're interested.

420
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:26,697
Speaker 1: Yes,

421
00:29:26,738 --> 00:29:39,160
Speaker 0: for example If you are not a member of the anime geekery and you may want to become or try it out We will tell you that probably on Wednesday, you know, if you are not a member if you're not a technology person You don't know shit about computers.

422
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:41,981
Speaker 0: All you know how to do is listen man This kid don't know shit about Pokemon.

423
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:45,475
Speaker 0: All you know how to do is listen to Podcasts and visit websites.

424
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,583
Speaker 0: We're gonna tell you how to become a computer nerd.

425
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:48,808
Speaker 0: We're gonna tell you all that stuff.

426
00:29:49,109 --> 00:30:02,589
Speaker 1: now I would like to clarify that the intended audience for this week's set of shows though Anyone can enjoy them and keep this in mind because the second one I think is very important for one Any of you out there who have an interest in these things, but just aren't sure how to go about it.

427
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:08,350
Speaker 1: Maybe you might like anime, but your friend brought over la blue girl and you think all anime is like that.

428
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:09,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you just don't know.

429
00:30:09,817 --> 00:30:10,722
Speaker 1: you don't know what to watch.

430
00:30:10,963 --> 00:30:12,109
Speaker 1: There's a million things out there.

431
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:17,620
Speaker 1: You like this German board game business, but you don't know the difference between Puerto Rico and Hellas Mm-hmm.

432
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,801
Speaker 0: I think that this week has two main purposes in my mind.

433
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:26,582
Speaker 0: one purpose is I know a lot of people listen to geek nights Who are really mainly into like one of the geekeries like.

434
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:28,750
Speaker 0: there are a lot of anime fans to listen to geek nights.

435
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:38,080
Speaker 0: They listen to all the days and they email us and they tell us yeah Listen to all the days even though I don't really care about video games or hey I listen to all the days, but I really only care about Monday.

436
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:42,696
Speaker 0: Yeah, so for those people we're gonna help you out Understanding the other days quite a bit.

437
00:30:42,837 --> 00:30:46,430
Speaker 0: and also if you have people that you know see friends out there.

438
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,045
Speaker 0: See, this is the second part and let's say you're an anime fan and your other friends.

439
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:52,450
Speaker 0: They're not so much the anime fans.

440
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,908
Speaker 0: Well, you can apply the episode to your friends to make them get into it.

441
00:30:57,592 --> 00:31:00,410
Speaker 1: Now this is important and don't forget this idea because

442
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:01,274
Speaker 0: While

443
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:14,013
Speaker 1: it might seem easy to get someone else to be interested in something that you yourself enjoy You have kind of a selective bias in how you present because you are already immersed in the fan culture or in the hobby Or whatever.

444
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:20,724
Speaker 1: So a lot of times anime is a good example because someone in our forums asked Hey, I kind of am interested in anime.

445
00:31:20,784 --> 00:31:21,790
Speaker 1: What anime should I watch?

446
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,936
Speaker 1: How do I get into this business?

447
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,390
Speaker 1: and I've noticed there wasn't just our forum.

448
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,232
Speaker 1: I see this everywhere.

449
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:36,861
Speaker 1: a lot of the people who give advice to people who aren't in their hobby will give them in my opinion Absurdly useless advice that if anything is going to keep them away from your hobby.

450
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:41,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you go into some IRC chatroom You're like, hey, I'm thinking about using this Linux.

451
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:41,853
Speaker 0: What do I do?

452
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:45,290
Speaker 0: and some guys like OMG and build your own computer and install Gen 2?

453
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,224
Speaker 0: It's like well, that's something you do when you're already into it.

454
00:31:48,264 --> 00:31:52,630
Speaker 0: That's not gonna get you into it That's just gonna make you pissed off and tired.

455
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:58,082
Speaker 1: Yep, or if someone wants to get into German board games We're not gonna throw Twilight struggle.

456
00:31:58,303 --> 00:32:01,999
Speaker 0: hell is and Puerto Rico Struggles a German game but regardless.

457
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:03,685
Speaker 0: Yes, you don't start out with that stuff.

458
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:04,990
Speaker 0: You start with the settlers of Catan.

459
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,642
Speaker 1: Everyone knows yeah that or possibly Carcassonne.

460
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:09,190
Speaker 0: Yeah Carcassonne is the other one.

461
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:27,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, and thus we realized that over the course of our years the front row crew We had a lot of common interests But we also had a lot of disparate interests and over time all of us got all of the rest of us Into many of our hobbies and we became a semi homogeneous culture of interests.

462
00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:33,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in the most recent one I think is Pete has gotten us more and more into metal.

463
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:43,722
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I think a lot of it is that when you're getting someone into something or getting into something yourself Someone pushing something on you rarely works.

464
00:32:43,802 --> 00:32:45,669
Speaker 0: You have to discover it on your own.

465
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:50,209
Speaker 0: But sometimes you know, you can try to discover it on your own and that'll work.

466
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:58,710
Speaker 0: But yet if you try to discover it on your own the wrong way You could have like this tainted first impression and most people won't go back once they have that tainted first impression.

467
00:32:58,892 --> 00:32:59,965
Speaker 1: I think about people who play D&D.

468
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:12,710
Speaker 1: How many of you out there who play Dungeons & Dragons and enjoy it have a friend who says something like oh I thought D&D would be really cool, but then I played it and it was just a bunch of scary nerds blah blah blah.

469
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:17,247
Speaker 1: It was stupid and horrible and the DM was an idiot and they just made stuff up and it wasn't fun and crap.

470
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:29,050
Speaker 1: and a Lot of those times they just happen to play with a group of people who in my opinion were playing at least I want I don't want to say objectively bad Dungeons & Dragons or anything like that because you can enjoy a game ever you want.

471
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:36,870
Speaker 1: But they were not playing it in the way that I enjoy it But because I enjoy it one way and this person would probably and also enjoy it that way.

472
00:33:37,151 --> 00:33:40,623
Speaker 1: But they were tainted by another group of people who play it a different way.

473
00:33:40,904 --> 00:33:42,570
Speaker 1: They have now written off the entire hobby.

474
00:33:42,911 --> 00:33:45,945
Speaker 0: All right, let's not spend the whole episode talking about the week itself.

475
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:47,672
Speaker 0: Let's get into it Alright.

476
00:33:47,712 --> 00:33:50,080
Speaker 1: so tonight being Monday science and tech day.

477
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,367
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about how to get into quantum physics.

478
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:53,310
Speaker 0: awesome.

479
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:56,076
Speaker 0: Step one be smart.

480
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:58,001
Speaker 0: step two take a lot of calculus.

481
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:01,288
Speaker 0: step three go to really fancy college a straight A's.

482
00:34:01,328 --> 00:34:11,618
Speaker 0: step four lots of internships and a hard life of much graduate school with lots of work and no fun and Lots of math and no money.

483
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,149
Speaker 0: and then one day Nobel Prize.

484
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:16,255
Speaker 1: Right that was easy.

485
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:18,400
Speaker 1: so how do you get into Linux?

486
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,590
Speaker 0: ah much more difficult.

487
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,922
Speaker 0: Honestly it depends how you want to get into Linux.

488
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:33,690
Speaker 0: like you could get into Linux like hey I don't want to be the random fool on the internet who doesn't know about Linux.

489
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,556
Speaker 0: So I want to figure out what the deal is.

490
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:39,949
Speaker 0: you could get into it like I want to use Linux as my desktop computer.

491
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:45,098
Speaker 0: Or you know what I. yeah, I don't want to use Linux as my desktop computer But I do.

492
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,886
Speaker 0: I have websites and I host them And I want to you know know enough about Linux that I can do my hosting better.

493
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:55,826
Speaker 0: or hey I want to actually learn about Linux and make Linux stuff and learn to code and all sorts of whatever.

494
00:34:56,067 --> 00:35:15,070
Speaker 1: now see here's the thing I generally get the impression when it comes to Linux or anything like that that the people who are of the most success getting into it are the people who Decided to get into it or even if they didn't decide because they didn't know about it Someone who has identified a problem with the current way they do things and is looking for a solution.

495
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:24,585
Speaker 1: even if they don't know that Linux is possibly the solution or OS X or whatever they recognize a problem and are looking for some way to get around it.

496
00:35:25,027 --> 00:35:30,783
Speaker 1: because without Some form of focus some sort of goal some sort of success condition.

497
00:35:31,284 --> 00:35:48,868
Speaker 1: It is very hard unless you have Ultra high dedication or just a lot of free time and a great motivation in and of itself to get into something like this Because you have no way to succeed you have nothing to keep you going no goal to strive for No reason other than for the fuck of it.

498
00:35:49,364 --> 00:36:02,524
Speaker 0: Yeah I find that with anything I do with computers in general is that if I don't have Some sort of actual goal like if it's just do something if I like if I want to learn a new programming language But I don't have an actual meaningful project to do with it.

499
00:36:02,846 --> 00:36:03,750
Speaker 0: I won't actually learn it.

500
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,887
Speaker 0: I'll just look at the tutorial and then forget what I read.

501
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:09,045
Speaker 1: yep That happened to me with I think Python was a good example.

502
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:13,830
Speaker 1: when I was an RIT I thought alright I should learn Python because I hate Java and I hate coding.

503
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:20,510
Speaker 1: But bash isn't really enough for the kind of scripts I need to write and pythons really easy and really good and awesome and I sat down.

504
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,442
Speaker 1: I started learning Python, and I got bored with it immediately and quit.

505
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:29,918
Speaker 1: then when I was working at IBM I needed to write a script for something I Couldn't really do it in bash.

506
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,070
Speaker 1: you probably could have oh yeah, but it would have sucked.

507
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:33,301
Speaker 1: It would have really sucked.

508
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,972
Speaker 1: you just said no I would have sucked.

509
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:35,876
Speaker 0: you could have done an awk.

510
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:42,543
Speaker 1: well part of it was that there were a bunch of Python functions that I Had from other coders and IBM that did things.

511
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:44,230
Speaker 1: so I had to interface with these things.

512
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,629
Speaker 1: So I just wrote the whole thing in Python instead of there you go.

513
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I had this goal.

514
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:51,550
Speaker 1: I learned a bunch of Python really quick and finished the job almost immediately.

515
00:36:51,933 --> 00:37:00,130
Speaker 1: I learned more in that week of having a goal With using Python then I did in two months of looking at books and trying to teach it to myself with nothing no reason.

516
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:05,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you're thinking about doing something with Linux What's your goal?

517
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:07,729
Speaker 0: is your goal to have a desktop that is?

518
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,523
Speaker 0: Free of spyware and doesn't crash because that's a good reason to go to Linux?

519
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:14,228
Speaker 0: is your goal to have a computer That's easier to use?

520
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:19,650
Speaker 0: Maybe your goal is to give your parents a computer that won't have so many problems that you have to keep fixing.

521
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:23,750
Speaker 1: Maybe your goal is to buy a new computer and not have to pay for or pirate windows.

522
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:33,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe your goal is like I said before to have some sort of you know Web server that you host and manage on your own instead of letting someone else do it for you.

523
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:39,490
Speaker 1: So I guess even if your goal your real goal is just I want to know what this Linux business is about.

524
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:44,710
Speaker 1: I want to get into it come up with something come up with some reason other than that to get into it.

525
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,458
Speaker 0: Otherwise you'll just poke it and be bored And it'll just be like a time-waster.

526
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:55,350
Speaker 1: because I think part of that problem is that Linux particularly Ubuntu has come far enough to where it mostly just works.

527
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:59,866
Speaker 1: So if you just turn on an Ubuntu CD, it's a lot like Windows.

528
00:38:00,127 --> 00:38:05,650
Speaker 1: you can word process You can get on the internet you can play a couple of little games, and then what are you gonna?

529
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,690
Speaker 0: Do you're gonna be like oh I can browse the web?

530
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:10,502
Speaker 0: I was doing that before with Windows or OS X whatever.

531
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,230
Speaker 0: you're using a big deal.

532
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:24,350
Speaker 1: So I guess my advice here is if you have no purpose no goal other than getting into it like we said Then I think your best goal your artificial goal is to try to go an entire week without rebooting back into Windows.

533
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:38,709
Speaker 1: Force your shell yourself to use Linux as much as possible Because then when you want to use your computer for something And it's not immediately obvious how to do it or make it work You'll be forced to interact with the Linux, and you'll learn a lot really quickly.

534
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:47,885
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean for all your basic stuff your instant messaging your web browsing and music listening Linux is kind of gonna just work for you pretty much especially Ubuntu.

535
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:56,330
Speaker 0: so yes But that's pretty much what you most people do with their computer is 90% of the time But everyone does something weird with their computer once in a while.

536
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:02,730
Speaker 0: You know maybe you like to encode videos or maybe you like to I don't know organize photos or something like that.

537
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:06,410
Speaker 0: And when that time comes you know the thing that you don't do with your computer that often.

538
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:11,143
Speaker 0: But you do do it, and you're using Linux, and you decided you're not gonna reboot.

539
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:12,928
Speaker 0: you're gonna end up learning something.

540
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:19,138
Speaker 1: yep I mean it might be as simple as say you've got some more stripped down Linux And you need to open up a word file.

541
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,014
Speaker 1: well now you realize you can't and you'll go around you'll find open office You'll install it.

542
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:23,858
Speaker 1: It'll start working.

543
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe you'll run into a Java problem.

544
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,996
Speaker 1: You have to fix that.

545
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:27,843
Speaker 1: the forums help you.

546
00:39:27,863 --> 00:39:28,608
Speaker 1: you get on your way.

547
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:35,030
Speaker 0: So the first thing you should do if you're thinking about getting into Linux is of course probably get an Ubuntu CD.

548
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:36,756
Speaker 0: Go to the Ubuntu website.

549
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:38,402
Speaker 0: There's an ISO file.

550
00:39:38,422 --> 00:39:39,165
Speaker 0: you download it.

551
00:39:39,346 --> 00:39:40,309
Speaker 0: you burn it to a CD.

552
00:39:40,913 --> 00:39:42,990
Speaker 0: There's instructions on their website to help you out.

553
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,263
Speaker 0: You need a CD burner by the way you put the CD in your computer.

554
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,005
Speaker 0: you boot off of the CD Which they are also instructions on the website.

555
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:56,530
Speaker 0: pretty much That's the first thing to know about Linux unlike Windows where if you have a problem searching on Google won't always help you that much.

556
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:59,357
Speaker 0: Linux Google always has the answer.

557
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:09,830
Speaker 0: you go to the website for whatever you're trying to figure out the Ubuntu forums the Gentoo forums Google Any Ubuntu wiki all sorts of places Debian website?

558
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,133
Speaker 0: There are people.

559
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:12,820
Speaker 0: all the answers are on the internet.

560
00:40:12,961 --> 00:40:17,036
Speaker 0: at the very worst you can go to the IRC Channel and someone will answer you.

561
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:26,689
Speaker 1: it is not a far cry to say that if you can't find the solution to your problem with Linux on Google you are probably well beyond the stage of getting into Linux.

562
00:40:27,312 --> 00:40:28,536
Speaker 0: Yes, that it's like.

563
00:40:29,138 --> 00:40:31,407
Speaker 0: a problem like that is such a difficult problem.

564
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:32,149
Speaker 0: it probably yes.

565
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:37,410
Speaker 1: I mean, that's at the point where well this experimental kernel won't work with this blah blah blah.

566
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:41,261
Speaker 1: And I ran these extra patches and March blah blah blah blah blah.

567
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:44,270
Speaker 0: any normal problem like my wireless card won't work.

568
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:45,613
Speaker 0: You know why does?

569
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:46,516
Speaker 0: why does my?

570
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:49,886
Speaker 0: how do I get this screensaver to turn on granted occasionally?

571
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:51,290
Speaker 1: sadly the answer is still?

572
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,470
Speaker 1: Oh, it just doesn't work, but you'll find that out pretty definitively pretty quickly.

573
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:55,624
Speaker 1: Yeah.

574
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,182
Speaker 0: And that's only if you have some weird or new hardware or something like that and

575
00:40:59,242 --> 00:40:59,402
Speaker 1: even

576
00:40:59,443 --> 00:41:00,245
Speaker 0: that too common

577
00:41:00,446 --> 00:41:11,949
Speaker 1: like apparently the motherboard I bought the a b9 had a lot of problems with Linux early on and Most of those problems have been fixed some of them in the interim between when I are made it and when it's coming back.

578
00:41:12,694 --> 00:41:14,850
Speaker 0: Yep, Lynn, that's unlike windows.

579
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:26,153
Speaker 0: You know where people work on something on Windows and they work on a work on it And then you don't get it until five years later when Vista comes out or seven years later when Vista 2 comes out Linux.

580
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:30,150
Speaker 0: they constantly fix stuff and make new stuff and it comes out within a couple days.

581
00:41:30,513 --> 00:41:32,489
Speaker 0: You're constantly updating things all over the place.

582
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:37,209
Speaker 0: So you get the CD you boot the CD you have a working Linux.

583
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,556
Speaker 0: I don't like we said.

584
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:41,049
Speaker 0: the next thing you want to do is force yourself to use it.

585
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:46,668
Speaker 1: Yep, maybe install it accomplish your goal, whatever you decide to set out to do try to do it.

586
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:50,602
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Now once you've gotten to that point, you're pretty much there.

587
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:51,626
Speaker 0: I mean you've got Linux.

588
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,694
Speaker 0: you probably installed it Which is not difficult.

589
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:57,350
Speaker 0: you click on an icon and you answer the questions and bam it's installed.

590
00:41:57,511 --> 00:41:58,618
Speaker 0: You can run it off your hard drive.

591
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,021
Speaker 0: It works.

592
00:41:59,444 --> 00:42:02,270
Speaker 1: Yeah at that point It's really no different than using windows.

593
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:10,140
Speaker 1: You just have to navigate around and use it and eventually every now and then you'll run into something that you might not understand And you'll probably find an answer pretty quickly.

594
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,642
Speaker 1: Yep.

595
00:42:11,185 --> 00:42:11,949
Speaker 0: So what do you do now?

596
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:28,110
Speaker 0: well, the thing is Ubuntu sort of makes things easy for you and While using Ubuntu you will learn how to use a slightly different Desktop environment to accomplish your daily tasks and you will learn how to not play 3d games all day and waste your time.

597
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:32,170
Speaker 1: Ah, I think there's another important thing that you learn from using Ubuntu even straight up.

598
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,995
Speaker 0: What is that you realize?

599
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:38,990
Speaker 1: or at least you'll start interacting with the open source paradigm of getting software?

600
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:43,850
Speaker 1: No more share where no more going to sites to get programs.

601
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:48,803
Speaker 1: You'll download things from repositories everything signed and verified.

602
00:42:49,004 --> 00:42:51,210
Speaker 1: you'll learn about repositories and how they work.

603
00:42:51,631 --> 00:42:56,889
Speaker 1: You'll realize that when you install a program, there's no such thing as where did it install to?

604
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,236
Speaker 0: yep, there is no such thing as where did it install to.

605
00:43:00,576 --> 00:43:01,919
Speaker 0: it's either installed or not.

606
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:08,790
Speaker 1: and Basically, these things don't matter a lot unless you really want to use Linux instead of just using Linux.

607
00:43:09,094 --> 00:43:19,746
Speaker 1: but at the same time I think this is an important part of learning about Linux is using Ubuntu or whatever easy distro and Interacting with these things easily throughout your normal days.

608
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:20,610
Speaker 1: use of a computer

609
00:43:21,192 --> 00:43:37,050
Speaker 0: but basically all you're gonna do by using Ubuntu is learn the stuff that you do and Learn as much as you need to do whatever you're doing, you know, if you're only gonna do so much you're eventually gonna learn Everything about the stuff you do and nothing else because Ubuntu is really easy.

610
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:43,790
Speaker 0: They did all that stuff for you And they don't force you to learn anything that you don't have to learn in order to get done what you want to get done.

611
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:50,135
Speaker 0: So if you want to learn more than what Ubuntu provides You actually can without.

612
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,624
Speaker 0: you don't actually have to leave Ubuntu right away because there are.

613
00:43:53,965 --> 00:44:03,689
Speaker 0: while Ubuntu makes things easy for you You can still get under the hood You can open up the command line you go digging around and you know, there are websites like I think it's like command line.

614
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:04,435
Speaker 0: calm I think.

615
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:07,989
Speaker 0: Oh Linux command org is the website.

616
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:17,821
Speaker 0: It is a really great website that just tells you how to use the Linux command line and all the basic Really simple commands and how all that stuff works.

617
00:44:17,962 --> 00:44:36,170
Speaker 1: Yep granted much like Linux itself Don't decide I am going to learn the Linux command line that come up with a task that you need to accomplish on your computer That you can't do easily any other way and then do it in the command line Where if you read you'll discover that usually it's a lot easier than it would have been to do it in the GUI.

618
00:44:36,732 --> 00:44:40,730
Speaker 0: Here's another hint that this is how I learned a lot of the things I know about Linux, right?

619
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:47,470
Speaker 0: What you're gonna end up doing whenever you have a problem is you're gonna go to a forum You're gonna go to Google and you're gonna say hey, this doesn't work.

620
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:48,112
Speaker 0: What do I do?

621
00:44:48,573 --> 00:45:00,028
Speaker 0: and someone might send you some instructions like click here do this type in this command now do this And you'll do all those things exactly as it says right there and nine times out of ten It'll work and you'll forget about it.

622
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:09,309
Speaker 0: Don't do that what you should do when anyone gives you a how to do this in Linux or you know Here's the fix to your problem in five easy steps.

623
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:18,925
Speaker 0: Make sure that when you do each of those steps that before you do it you 100% understand exactly what you are doing in each step.

624
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:27,919
Speaker 1: in the very least Look at what the commands are and try to figure out what they're doing just easily even if it's not the exact detail just Kind of what it's doing.

625
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,241
Speaker 1: Okay.

626
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:29,450
Speaker 1: I'm copying this file here.

627
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,515
Speaker 1: I wonder what that file is.

628
00:45:30,837 --> 00:45:33,550
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz basically that's how I learned everything.

629
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:38,966
Speaker 0: I know is someone to give me a how-to and I would say alright I could just type these things in and they'll work.

630
00:45:39,026 --> 00:45:46,989
Speaker 0: sort of like You know if someone gave you instructions on how to fix your TV and they said You know kick it and you kicked it and it worked.

631
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,817
Speaker 0: Well, why did that work?

632
00:45:48,977 --> 00:45:52,270
Speaker 0: and you kind of if you know why it worked suddenly?

633
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:59,132
Speaker 0: A lot of other things will start to make sense and you'll get pieces and they'll put together and you'll it's really that's how it Goes man.

634
00:45:59,434 --> 00:46:00,237
Speaker 0: That's the way to learn.

635
00:46:00,398 --> 00:46:00,619
Speaker 1: Yep.

636
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:05,415
Speaker 1: Now if you want to move beyond that, I Think it's Gentoo time.

637
00:46:05,777 --> 00:46:13,406
Speaker 0: Yeah, see Ubuntu makes everything easy for you And it's sort of a lot of things are unnecessary to tweak.

638
00:46:13,446 --> 00:46:18,280
Speaker 0: like you can go and tweak them But you wouldn't ever think to because they're already correct.

639
00:46:18,922 --> 00:46:20,747
Speaker 0: And this is why Gen 2 Linux exists.

640
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:28,470
Speaker 0: Gen 2 Linux is Still Linux but the design of the distribution is a completely different principle from Ubuntu.

641
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:35,065
Speaker 0: I'm not going to explain it but regardless to say needless to say Gentoo makes you learn.

642
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:38,259
Speaker 0: it basically Makes you make it.

643
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,230
Speaker 1: but yet don't think that you'll be in over your head.

644
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,775
Speaker 1: even if you don't know a lot about Linux.

645
00:46:43,156 --> 00:46:49,033
Speaker 1: you could use Gentoo or at least get it working because their documentation is Wonderful.

646
00:46:49,133 --> 00:47:02,969
Speaker 1: and if you follow their how to make a Gentoo step by step where it shows you what to type and then it Explains what you just typed why you typed it and what it did and if you follow it step by step by the end You'll have a mostly working Gentoo.

647
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:13,422
Speaker 1: And as long as you actually read all that text and didn't just type the things that said but actually learned what those things were Doing you'll suddenly realize so that's what a kernel is.

648
00:47:13,924 --> 00:47:15,128
Speaker 1: So that's where it is, huh?

649
00:47:17,313 --> 00:47:22,490
Speaker 0: Oh, that's how that thing works, that's what that piece does see because Linux is all pieces unlike Windows.

650
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,615
Speaker 0: It's just one blob.

651
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:24,438
Speaker 0: That's all Windows.

652
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:29,289
Speaker 0: Well, I believe you mean GNU Linux, whatever Windows is one big blob.

653
00:47:29,691 --> 00:47:33,803
Speaker 0: Linux is a bunch of tiny pieces and many of the pieces are interchangeable.

654
00:47:33,963 --> 00:47:44,940
Speaker 0: or perhaps you can choose between pieces have them all simultaneously and use whichever one you want or have multiple pieces all working together and each part of the Whole system can be switched out.

655
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:47,430
Speaker 0: You could have grub or lilo as your bootloader.

656
00:47:47,691 --> 00:47:52,910
Speaker 0: You can have GDM KDM or some other ones as your you know, login manager.

657
00:47:53,031 --> 00:47:56,810
Speaker 0: You can have KDE XFCE gnome as your window manager.

658
00:47:57,171 --> 00:48:03,929
Speaker 0: You can have so many different choices all over the place and using Ubuntu Those choices are mostly made for you.

659
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:08,284
Speaker 0: You can change the choices, but they've already decided for you in Gentoo.

660
00:48:08,565 --> 00:48:09,990
Speaker 0: They don't decide anything for you.

661
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:14,730
Speaker 0: They basically give you nothing and you have to pick the pieces for yourself one at a time.

662
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:15,153
Speaker 1: They do.

663
00:48:15,213 --> 00:48:17,750
Speaker 1: however don't leave you completely in the cold.

664
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:31,349
Speaker 1: They often give suggestions like I think one good example was how to deal with logs on the computer And they give you like four different options and they explain in very brief Just well this one's kind of like this and this one's kind of like this and this one's kind of like this.

665
00:48:31,752 --> 00:48:34,408
Speaker 0: And this is everyone you probably use the most people use Yep.

666
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:37,824
Speaker 1: And then for cron your cron jobs and all that they give you examples of.

667
00:48:38,045 --> 00:48:39,671
Speaker 1: we could use this one or this one or this One.

668
00:48:39,932 --> 00:48:42,381
Speaker 1: we recommend this one because it's easy but blah blah blah.

669
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,810
Speaker 0: Meanwhile in Ubuntu, you probably didn't even know what cron was.

670
00:48:44,977 --> 00:48:53,154
Speaker 0: Yeah Now suddenly you're forced to install cron configure cron and learn how to use cron all at once Basically, you can.

671
00:48:53,174 --> 00:48:56,704
Speaker 0: then you go back to your Ubuntu and you see hey cron is there.

672
00:48:56,905 --> 00:48:59,719
Speaker 0: it just never forced me to nope Pay attention to it at all.

673
00:48:59,759 --> 00:49:01,250
Speaker 0: It was already set up and nice working.

674
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:04,710
Speaker 1: Gentoo will force you anytime you want something new to work.

675
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:09,170
Speaker 1: It'll force you to learn at least on a base level how that thing works.

676
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:13,442
Speaker 0: Yep, like an Ubuntu you want to make the Apache web server work.

677
00:49:13,543 --> 00:49:16,793
Speaker 0: you do app get install Apache install it It works.

678
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:17,616
Speaker 0: end of story.

679
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:19,364
Speaker 0: It just happens in Gentoo.

680
00:49:19,384 --> 00:49:20,890
Speaker 0: You want the Apache web server work?

681
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,223
Speaker 0: Well you install it which is is easy enough.

682
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:24,470
Speaker 0: you emerge Apache.

683
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:34,446
Speaker 0: Now you have to configure it and you'll pretty much be forced to learn how to configure Apache Whereas Ubuntu comes with a default configuration.

684
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:34,989
Speaker 0: That is nice.

685
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:42,170
Speaker 0: Gentoo comes with a default Configuration that is not as nice and is will not just work the way you want it to by default.

686
00:49:42,451 --> 00:49:50,102
Speaker 1: But at the same time because it doesn't just do stuff for you There's no chance that your computer did something that you didn't make it do somehow.

687
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:50,965
Speaker 1: Yep.

688
00:49:51,045 --> 00:49:56,834
Speaker 1: So whenever there's a problem I'm not I mean, it doesn't mean you're stupid because God by Gentoo I it's alright.

689
00:49:57,016 --> 00:49:59,909
Speaker 0: for anyone out there who's like Oh Gentoo sounds too hard You know what?

690
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:09,270
Speaker 1: I first time I built a Gentoo I was all excited and I built it over three days.

691
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:14,874
Speaker 1: it was ready to go and then I rebooted into it and my network card wouldn't work and I couldn't figure out how to Make it work.

692
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,330
Speaker 1: and I freaked out and eventually reinstalled it.

693
00:50:17,611 --> 00:50:23,734
Speaker 1: And then the second time through the install I get to the networking part and I'm like, oh I get it I'm just a dumbass.

694
00:50:24,075 --> 00:50:28,911
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did like five or six of those before I finally figured out everything I need.

695
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:34,475
Speaker 1: the only reason I only did one was because Scott actually gave me a lot of advice Particularly with the kernel.

696
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:36,040
Speaker 1: he's like, all right, don't enable that.

697
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,224
Speaker 1: All right, don't enable that.

698
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:38,087
Speaker 1: enable that.

699
00:50:38,388 --> 00:50:38,910
Speaker 1: you need that.

700
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:44,957
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is either but that kind of crap the Linux kernel basically is is one program.

701
00:50:44,997 --> 00:50:54,290
Speaker 0: when you're when Linux starts it loads the kernel into memory and the kernel is This one thing down at the bottom of the heap that every other program talks to it.

702
00:50:54,330 --> 00:51:00,750
Speaker 0: Basically, it's the thing that goes in between your hardware the physical chips and everything else on your computer.

703
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:10,075
Speaker 0: So the way it works is you configure the kernel there are many pieces of it is completely modular in every way and Every piece of the kernel.

704
00:51:10,215 --> 00:51:19,849
Speaker 0: you can either choose to not have it have it in the kernel itself or have it as a module Which means it'll be there, but it'll only actually get loaded if you're gonna use it now.

705
00:51:20,313 --> 00:51:25,666
Speaker 1: Distributions like Red Hat and Ubuntu Tend to just throw a lot of stuff into the kernel to make it more likely to work.

706
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:29,310
Speaker 0: the Ubuntu kernel Basically is the full almost the full kernel.

707
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:34,950
Speaker 0: They have so many extra stuff in there and they have everything turned on and it's a really big kernel.

708
00:51:35,352 --> 00:51:42,986
Speaker 0: But because it's so big no matter what computer you try to use it on It'll probably work because it'll have whatever you need in there.

709
00:51:43,328 --> 00:51:46,968
Speaker 1: Gentoo Meanwhile gives you pretty much nothing and you got to go through and pick.

710
00:51:47,008 --> 00:51:58,350
Speaker 0: Yes individual thing Gentoo gives you the kernel the way it was meant to be given and You go through the kernel configuration every single menu probably every single menu.

711
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:03,630
Speaker 0: You probably should reading what each bit does and deciding whether you need that bit or not.

712
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,041
Speaker 0: You know what most of the bits you don't need.

713
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:14,745
Speaker 1: it took me Over an hour to sit there and go through the kernel looking at everything and wondering what it was Looking in the documentation to see what it was trying to figure out.

714
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:17,299
Speaker 1: if I needed it Some stuff I had to figure out.

715
00:52:17,379 --> 00:52:19,210
Speaker 1: Oh, well because you're booting with blah blah blah.

716
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:24,950
Speaker 1: You can't have that be in module because you won't be able to load the module before you need it So you'll have to file it into the kernel.

717
00:52:26,251 --> 00:52:41,790
Speaker 0: Doing this will not only familiarize you with your Linux system and Linux kernel It will also make you very familiar with the hardware in your computer because if you don't know what hardware is in your computer Specifically you will have a very difficult time configuring the kernel.

718
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:45,262
Speaker 0: Yes with the hardware if it's a mystery box and it's not just.

719
00:52:45,443 --> 00:52:52,784
Speaker 1: oh I have X brand network card All right, I have X chipset on X network card, yeah, it's like.

720
00:52:53,025 --> 00:53:01,670
Speaker 0: do I have the silicon image Serial ATA controller or do I have the 3215?

721
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,814
Speaker 0: Serial ATA controller?

722
00:53:03,095 --> 00:53:05,322
Speaker 0: and people don't even know what a serial ATA controller is.

723
00:53:05,803 --> 00:53:07,709
Speaker 0: so you can see already how?

724
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:14,230
Speaker 0: Installing gen 2 Linux forces you to learn so many things about your computer and Linux and everything.

725
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:18,050
Speaker 1: Yep, like in that case it also teaches you like oh you need to know all this hardware.

726
00:53:18,472 --> 00:53:21,570
Speaker 1: It teaches you how to get that information from your hardware.

727
00:53:22,013 --> 00:53:33,590
Speaker 0: Yep, a lot of the reason I know so much I know is because I forced myself to learn all that stuff and I use gen 2 for many years And I don't know as much as Scott But I learned more in the year or so.

728
00:53:33,771 --> 00:53:37,230
Speaker 1: I actively kept my gen 2 up to date before I just stopped.

729
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:40,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, then I did in the rest of my time using Linux.

730
00:53:40,811 --> 00:53:50,490
Speaker 0: So if you want to get into Linux get an Ubuntu CD and get to work and make sure you have a Reason to be doing this don't just do it for the sake of it because you're not gonna get anywhere.

731
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:52,316
Speaker 0: You're gonna lose interest and quit.

732
00:53:52,757 --> 00:54:07,394
Speaker 1: if you're serious about it, or you want to use it for a job or career or whatever I would say that any Linux professional or any computer professional should build at least one gen 2. or If you're hardcore Completely Linux from scratch.

733
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:12,830
Speaker 0: Yes gen 2 is bait is really a system that makes doing Linux from scratch easier.

734
00:54:13,192 --> 00:54:17,170
Speaker 0: It's basically Linux from scratch only with some stuff to help you do it.

735
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:18,657
Speaker 0: You can actually do it.

736
00:54:18,697 --> 00:54:19,701
Speaker 0: go to Linux from.

737
00:54:19,943 --> 00:54:26,510
Speaker 0: I think it's LFS is the website I think I don't remember Linux from scratch org and that will tell you how to build this.

738
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,677
Speaker 0: There's like a document there that you can read.

739
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:37,070
Speaker 0: that will tell you how to make Linux from scratch by hand Completely 100% and it takes a long time a real long time.

740
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:43,410
Speaker 0: But you'll probably learn even more than you learn doing like three Gentoos because there's nothing helping you out except this book.

741
00:54:43,792 --> 00:54:54,030
Speaker 1: But I mean if you're a professional or you want to be a professional Doing this once and dealing with it for even a short amount of time will give you a very valuable foundation.

742
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,033
Speaker 1: Yes, how many were?

743
00:54:55,053 --> 00:54:57,862
Speaker 0: suddenly you'll go from that nub in the Ubuntu forums going?

744
00:54:57,882 --> 00:55:00,270
Speaker 0: How does my wireless work?

745
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:04,644
Speaker 0: What's this ndis rapper business to the guy in the Gentoo forums going?

746
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:06,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't want that kernel module.

747
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,196
Speaker 0: It takes up a lot of memory and slows you down.

748
00:55:08,377 --> 00:55:10,704
Speaker 1: and don't be afraid to ask for help.

749
00:55:10,805 --> 00:55:18,230
Speaker 1: while there are scary Linux nerds Out there who will make fun of you and berate you there are many more people who will just answer your question.

750
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:28,701
Speaker 0: In fact, if anything for every guy for image even in the Gentoo forums or even on IRCs for every one guy Who's like our TFM nub there's like three guys who are like.

751
00:55:28,721 --> 00:55:30,607
Speaker 0: here's a link to the how-to.

752
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,125
Speaker 0: Read this yeah,

753
00:55:33,145 --> 00:55:40,972
Speaker 1: well in fact Scott as an example not only does he like to help us all of us in the front row crew with our Linux trouble But he

754
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:41,273
Speaker 0: will

755
00:55:41,835 --> 00:55:46,549
Speaker 1: out of the blue go out of his way to impart new Linux knowledge unto us rather or not we want it.

756
00:55:46,931 --> 00:55:53,875
Speaker 0: Yep, I also go out of my way to force people to try to do things the more efficient way like hey use the keyboard Shortcut bitch.

757
00:55:54,399 --> 00:55:55,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd have my ass.

758
00:55:57,013 --> 00:55:59,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do respect the superiority of you dev.

759
00:55:59,388 --> 00:56:03,360
Speaker 0: However Yeah, you realize that Dev FS is basically dead.

760
00:56:03,801 --> 00:56:05,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know isn't?

761
00:56:05,206 --> 00:56:06,510
Speaker 1: you'd have default now in Gentoo.

762
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,979
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's the default period in all Linux.

763
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:11,969
Speaker 1: Yeah good cuz this Gentoo is not.

764
00:56:13,212 --> 00:56:14,017
Speaker 0: Wow, that's old.

765
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:14,681
Speaker 1: Well.

766
00:56:14,882 --> 00:56:15,808
Speaker 1: I have an update.

767
00:56:16,029 --> 00:56:21,056
Speaker 1: God You should see what happens if I type the word emerge in my current Gentoo My Gentoo.

768
00:56:21,137 --> 00:56:23,507
Speaker 1: the way it functions is no longer supported by anyone.

769
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:33,069
