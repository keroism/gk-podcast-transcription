1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,087
Speaker 1: It's Monday November 20th.

2
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:14,337
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and I'm Rin and this is Geeknet.

3
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:21,525
Speaker 1: Tonight we have a short episode and we're tired and sick, so I respond to one email about the Linux and the TS3.

4
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:21,907
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

5
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:34,125
Speaker 0: You know, you're probably not going to believe us, but we're gonna have a short episode tonight.

6
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:42,503
Speaker 0: Now you might be thinking "Gab, because you guys have a Wii and you want to play it well while that was going to be true it ended up not being true.

7
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:54,848
Speaker 0: we're actually not doing so well because we both got a little sick yeah and it didn't help that our friend Yuko was over and Emily was over and all our friends were in Philly at a party.

8
00:00:54,888 --> 00:01:01,298
Speaker 0: meanwhile we were in our house along with my little brother who I hadn't seen in like three years and his friend yeah.

9
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,315
Speaker 0: so it ended up being an awesome but not very relaxing weekend.

10
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:20,897
Speaker 1: all you have to know about my weekend was on Saturday I beat Resident Evil 4 yeah and then Sunday morning Sunday morning I went to the city and waited in line for four hours to get my guaranteed Nintendo Wii at the Nintendo World Store.

11
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:24,675
Speaker 1: but the only reason I had to wait for four hours was because they couldn't.

12
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:29,155
Speaker 1: they didn't have enough cash registers and they couldn't check people out fast enough.

13
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:34,363
Speaker 0: yeah so props to Scott for braving because Scott was already a little sick and he had to stand out there.

14
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:38,220
Speaker 1: yeah but I got one guaranteed the only thing they would.

15
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:39,567
Speaker 1: we'll talk about it tomorrow.

16
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:40,733
Speaker 0: yeah we'll have a detail.

17
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:42,704
Speaker 1: but all you have to know is we got we.

18
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:48,092
Speaker 0: so this week will be a little short as in today we're not doing much and not to mention like Wednesday.

19
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,545
Speaker 1: I'm going to my parents house for Thanksgiving.

20
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:53,662
Speaker 0: yeah there might not be an episode Wednesday Friday I probably won't work.

21
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:54,950
Speaker 1: so it's like this week.

22
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,237
Speaker 1: is this week might be shot?

23
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:58,169
Speaker 0: yeah well there's gonna be no episode Thursday.

24
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:58,953
Speaker 0: fuck you guys.

25
00:01:59,054 --> 00:02:05,878
Speaker 1: I mean we almost didn't do an episode today just because there's no news except we and ps3 news.

26
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:09,053
Speaker 0: yeah well there's there's a bunch of real-world news.

27
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,157
Speaker 1: oh yeah we don't talk about.

28
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,857
Speaker 0: well no I wanted to talk about it but I kind of feel a bit shit right now.

29
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:15,505
Speaker 1: yeah I definitely feel some shit.

30
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:27,565
Speaker 1: so I think the plan for this week actually is if we just make a really long like a we episode tomorrow then we won't have to make anything else this week something like that.

31
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:30,315
Speaker 0: all I got to say is I have a lot of words about the we.

32
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:33,492
Speaker 1: we got lots of words so we're gonna let that episode go.

33
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:36,689
Speaker 1: yep and we're gonna in order to make you know it make it all work.

34
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,504
Speaker 1: we just don't do some other episodes and it doesn't hurt us.

35
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:42,919
Speaker 0: man I would have been okay except last night really didn't?

36
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:51,158
Speaker 0: it turned into a slumber party of staying up all night playing we boxing and talking about dumb stuff and I only got like three hours of sleep.

37
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:54,413
Speaker 1: yeah I actually went to sleep a little earlier and didn't go to work today.

38
00:02:54,473 --> 00:03:01,234
Speaker 1: but yeah yeah in this episode I might like cough sometimes.

39
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:03,764
Speaker 0: yeah Scott's been hacking up a dead something.

40
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:08,764
Speaker 1: I think I'm at the stage of being sick or I'm not actually so sick anymore.

41
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:10,833
Speaker 1: it's just I got a cough up all the mucus.

42
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:13,845
Speaker 0: yeah I'll bet you have some sort of viral thing.

43
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:14,949
Speaker 1: who knows?

44
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,135
Speaker 1: it'll be gone in a day or two.

45
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,828
Speaker 0: all I gotta say is I'm taking some NyQuil real soon.

46
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,235
Speaker 1: do we still have NyQuil?

47
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:21,500
Speaker 0: I have some NyQuil.

48
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:22,163
Speaker 0: is it still good?

49
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:22,907
Speaker 0: it might be.

50
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:25,217
Speaker 0: does it have isn't you know what I have?

51
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,708
Speaker 0: some Sudafed real Sudafed with Sudafedrin.

52
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:31,505
Speaker 1: see I don't like Sudafed but like I like NyQuil take them both.

53
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:32,971
Speaker 1: oh no that's dangerous.

54
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:39,392
Speaker 1: if you have real NyQuil that not the meth free NyQuil then I'll have some.

55
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:40,740
Speaker 0: why not just have the Sudafed?

56
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,564
Speaker 0: it works just as well.

57
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:42,450
Speaker 1: I don't like Sudafed.

58
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,952
Speaker 0: why not?

59
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:45,842
Speaker 1: because it's it's not it's a it's a swallow thing.

60
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:47,288
Speaker 1: what I mean?

61
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:48,452
Speaker 1: I can't swallow a pill?

62
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:49,175
Speaker 1: no I can't.

63
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:53,352
Speaker 0: I just prefer not to okay but the pills tend to work a lot better.

64
00:03:53,372 --> 00:04:00,403
Speaker 0: yeah yeah what are you gonna do if you ever have to take drugs if you're forced to take an antibiotic or something?

65
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:03,318
Speaker 1: I've done it before cuz bioxin pills are gigantic.

66
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,146
Speaker 1: I've done it before and I've taken them.

67
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:06,291
Speaker 1: I just don't like it.

68
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,817
Speaker 0: Sudafed pills are tiny.

69
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:09,222
Speaker 1: how tiny is it?

70
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:12,736
Speaker 0: it's like a little nub and I still don't like doing it was.

71
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:16,291
Speaker 1: I mean I will if I have no other choice but I just don't like it.

72
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:20,737
Speaker 0: see maybe it's the same reason why for some here I have another choice which is awesome NyQuil.

73
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:22,123
Speaker 1: so why would I bother?

74
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:23,770
Speaker 0: yeah I think it's the same reason.

75
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,763
Speaker 0: you can't drink soda cuz it hurts your throat.

76
00:04:25,804 --> 00:04:27,051
Speaker 0: I think your throat's got a problem.

77
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:28,880
Speaker 1: no the soda doesn't hurt my throat it's my mouth.

78
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:31,752
Speaker 0: why so doesn't hurt your mouth?

79
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:34,063
Speaker 0: it's psychological it's psychosomatic.

80
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:36,412
Speaker 1: it could be but it's still gotta be.

81
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,620
Speaker 0: who knows we'll do a double blind.

82
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:42,193
Speaker 0: all right we really can't do a double blind.

83
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:44,649
Speaker 1: well I'll just drink a beverage without knowing what it is.

84
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:53,541
Speaker 0: there's no placebo though because that's like saying yeah we're gonna see if you can taste the difference between orange juice and an empty glass.

85
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:57,874
Speaker 0: what are you gonna use for a placebo?

86
00:04:57,894 --> 00:05:04,996
Speaker 0: a orange empty glass flat soda an empty glass with a flat ginger ale.

87
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:08,013
Speaker 0: anyway I'm not even gonna bother with the thing of the day music.

88
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:10,472
Speaker 0: we're just gonna have some things of the day and get the hell out of here tonight.

89
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:12,763
Speaker 1: yeah we're cutting it real short aren't we?

90
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:14,492
Speaker 0: you know what that's fine we do.

91
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:15,618
Speaker 0: how many episodes have we done?

92
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,067
Speaker 0: we're allowed to have a good one.

93
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:17,670
Speaker 1: I'm gonna.

94
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,848
Speaker 1: I'll talk about something like for technology for like five minutes.

95
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:21,351
Speaker 0: what do you?

96
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,984
Speaker 0: what are you gonna talk about other than the we?

97
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:26,195
Speaker 1: someone asked me a question on the.

98
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:27,763
Speaker 1: I'm gonna look in an email.

99
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:28,346
Speaker 1: I'll answer.

100
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:32,006
Speaker 0: so you don't even know what the question was hold on and now I got a stall for time.

101
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:35,462
Speaker 1: well you're like doll just talk about your thing of the day all right.

102
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:46,964
Speaker 0: so you go was over here hanging out with the rest of us over the weekend the we can and she mentioned that there is a video called unicorn versus narwhal.

103
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:53,827
Speaker 0: now unicorns are known for having horns as our narwhals and this is some students a project.

104
00:05:54,268 --> 00:06:01,225
Speaker 0: it's an animation but about half of it maybe a little more ends up being animatics because obviously the kid didn't have enough time to finish it.

105
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:06,675
Speaker 0: so we only animated some of it and the rest is just you know animatic like still shots and then the audio was dubbed over it.

106
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:09,586
Speaker 0: it's kind of quirky kind of funny.

107
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:17,122
Speaker 0: it's really cheesy but it's cheesy on purpose for comedic effect and I really can't say much about it except that you need to watch it.

108
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:20,480
Speaker 0: it's hilarious and the horses look exactly like Ren and Stimpy horses.

109
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,027
Speaker 1: I like the ending a little bit.

110
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:23,053
Speaker 0: I like that a lot.

111
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:24,118
Speaker 1: I like the dragon.

112
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:24,842
Speaker 0: I like the drugs.

113
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:27,695
Speaker 0: I put my little dragon wings as fast as I can.

114
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:31,009
Speaker 1: yeah good voice actor on the dragon because it doesn't fit in.

115
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:32,357
Speaker 1: so and it's hilarious.

116
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:34,690
Speaker 0: they're pretty much everyone voice acting and this is great.

117
00:06:35,051 --> 00:06:37,401
Speaker 1: yeah I mean you don't bring it wasn't?

118
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:47,205
Speaker 1: I think the reason it wasn't done is it's one of those over-your-head things that happens in CS a lot is you get some guy who says all right for this project for this class.

119
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:52,413
Speaker 1: you know the teacher lets you do whatever you want so he goes all right I'm gonna make a mush from scratch.

120
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:53,237
Speaker 1: and he tried.

121
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:56,313
Speaker 1: he goes for it and he's got ten weeks and of course he comes up short.

122
00:06:56,735 --> 00:07:03,101
Speaker 1: the work he's done is great but the reason doesn't finish is because the scope of his project was too large.

123
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:04,766
Speaker 1: for you know the target.

124
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:10,047
Speaker 1: yeah but it's like I got ten weeks in this class and there's a final project.

125
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:14,062
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make an entirely new operating system.

126
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:16,954
Speaker 1: let's go and we bet it in Linux it's gonna have this and this.

127
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:18,501
Speaker 1: you know it doesn't work.

128
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:20,390
Speaker 0: yeah but mad props for this thing.

129
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,926
Speaker 0: I mean the winds of change are changing all right.

130
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:27,414
Speaker 1: my thing of the day is the spoof.

131
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,225
Speaker 1: you know jackass those guys who hurt themselves.

132
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:37,054
Speaker 0: yeah I think this is kind of based on because there's been a couple of black comedians who have made jokes to this effect.

133
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:38,920
Speaker 0: I think Bill Cosby even used to.

134
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:43,879
Speaker 1: maybe anyway jackass I actually think it's kind of okay.

135
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,880
Speaker 1: like like the first time I saw it I was like a guys in a porta potty got tipped over.

136
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,027
Speaker 1: these guys are making videos.

137
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:53,540
Speaker 1: they're making owned videos of themselves.

138
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:55,812
Speaker 1: basically yeah and you know I like owned videos.

139
00:07:56,114 --> 00:08:00,995
Speaker 1: so I like that even though it's forced but it's not quite as good as a real owned video.

140
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:02,240
Speaker 0: you know I guess to me it's.

141
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:10,181
Speaker 0: it's almost better in that it's not painful because it's not someone you know accidentally getting hurt or someone you just like actually really getting hurt.

142
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,730
Speaker 0: it's just a bunch of guys.

143
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:14,024
Speaker 1: well they do really hurt themselves but they want to.

144
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:18,303
Speaker 1: well yeah it's like that video of people shocking each other with a taser they bought.

145
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:23,512
Speaker 0: it's a bunch of guys who decided we're going to hurt ourselves for your amusement and you know what they make.

146
00:08:23,532 --> 00:08:25,422
Speaker 0: enough money to wear more power to them.

147
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:27,291
Speaker 1: yeah it's it's like that.

148
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:28,175
Speaker 1: what's that joke?

149
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:35,813
Speaker 1: they always say like someone pretending to be an old lady falling down the stairs is funny but if you're a comedian it's got to be a real old lady.

150
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:41,212
Speaker 0: huh you must listen to pen radio must must possibly Gilbert Godfrey?

151
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:45,404
Speaker 1: yeah so yeah cuz I'm just so hip jaded.

152
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:49,463
Speaker 1: yeah seeing so many funny things on the internet that I need to I need it to be a real?

153
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:49,966
Speaker 0: I don't know.

154
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:55,997
Speaker 0: over this weekend I saw about five funny things on the internet I hadn't seen before one of which was my thing of the day.

155
00:08:56,097 --> 00:08:58,191
Speaker 1: most of them were people waiting in line for the ps3?

156
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:01,486
Speaker 0: yeah okay now there's this other video of.

157
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,500
Speaker 0: it's basically a bunch of kittens versus a bunch of bananas on strings.

158
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:10,003
Speaker 1: so the video for my thing of the day is a guy named Tracy Morgan who I know.

159
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:14,405
Speaker 1: that name is a famous name and now I know what he looks like but I have no idea what he does.

160
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:16,677
Speaker 1: I'm sure I could look it up on Wikipedia but I don't care.

161
00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:22,739
Speaker 1: I'm doing a show right now and he pretends that he's on jackass but he calls it black ass.

162
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,851
Speaker 1: he does what a black man would do?

163
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:35,057
Speaker 1: well what a stereotypical humorous black man would do if forced to be in a you know jackass movie?

164
00:09:35,138 --> 00:09:42,092
Speaker 0: see I've seen multiple black comedians where because a lot of black comedians can make racial jokes that if a white comedian tried to make

165
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:45,374
Speaker 1: sort of like the dentist who pretends to be Jewish to say just for the jokes yeah

166
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:52,250
Speaker 0: yeah but I've seen numerous comedians who will do a whole bit about how black guys do stupid things and white guys do stupid things.

167
00:09:52,712 --> 00:10:00,764
Speaker 0: but the kinds of stupid things white people do are way more dangerous and stupid and the jokes are always like black man wouldn't do that.

168
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:03,175
Speaker 0: well that's what this seems to be.

169
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:04,621
Speaker 1: that is what this is.

170
00:10:04,902 --> 00:10:06,088
Speaker 1: it's actually pretty funny.

171
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:10,213
Speaker 0: the white the guys are like all right like they show it like he's standing there and they're like all right.

172
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:11,360
Speaker 0: you got to do this thing.

173
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:12,909
Speaker 0: he's like I ain't doing that.

174
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:14,114
Speaker 1: what the fuck?

175
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,907
Speaker 0: yep yep the part of the end is what really got me.

176
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:21,681
Speaker 1: yes the best part okay yeah.

177
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,190
Speaker 0: so we're gonna kind of ramble a bit and then wrap this show up.

178
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,682
Speaker 0: yeah very fast karate style this whole show.

179
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:27,024
Speaker 1: I'm gonna.

180
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,009
Speaker 1: I found the email.

181
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,938
Speaker 1: it's I'm gonna do this quick geek back.

182
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:31,827
Speaker 0: I actually reply Oh a geek bag.

183
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:37,872
Speaker 1: yeah I replied to this guy with a pretty long email but I'm gonna just do a little summary.

184
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:42,895
Speaker 0: is this the one that went to the geek nights email that I saw the one about Linux on a ps3?

185
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:44,703
Speaker 0: yep yep yep okay.

186
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:46,951
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna read this guy's email cuz pretty short.

187
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:53,465
Speaker 1: it's a guy from Taipei guy from Taiwan.

188
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:54,387
Speaker 1: what's up Taiwan?

189
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:58,321
Speaker 1: he says yo I know you guys don't do reader mail or anything.

190
00:10:58,562 --> 00:10:59,546
Speaker 1: we do just not often.

191
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,334
Speaker 1: but there's a question.

192
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:04,932
Speaker 1: maybe you could just answer or address in on a tech night or something.

193
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:14,928
Speaker 1: so Terra software release a version of yellow dog Linux version 5.0 to run on the ps3 say I have the 60 gig version and USB mouse and keyboard.

194
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,542
Speaker 1: what programs media applications games and etc.

195
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:19,847
Speaker 1: would I be able to run?

196
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:22,177
Speaker 1: how user-friendly is yellow dog?

197
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:25,934
Speaker 1: I have no Linux experience and is there any actual benefit at all?

198
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:29,370
Speaker 1: or is this just a thing to do to market the ps3 as a computer?

199
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:32,503
Speaker 1: well let's see if I can sum this up pretty quick.

200
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:37,643
Speaker 1: if you install Linux on your ps3 it's no different than installing Linux.

201
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:42,382
Speaker 1: well it's mostly no different than installing Linux on a normal computer.

202
00:11:43,004 --> 00:11:46,315
Speaker 1: you can do anything that you can do with a Linux computer.

203
00:11:46,877 --> 00:12:00,224
Speaker 1: the trick is that the ps3 is missing some components that a normal computer has and some of the components of a ps3 are different than what a normal computer has mainly the processor.

204
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:13,534
Speaker 0: yes you see all computers that you have ever used to pretty much either been a power PC very rarely only if it's an old Mac or an x86 most likely and those are pretty much the standard.

205
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:24,686
Speaker 0: everything else out there you will never run afoul of in your small life unless you are a technology professional and even then you'll rarely run afoul of anything else unless you are working with mobile devices.

206
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:30,166
Speaker 1: yes yes or giant giant big iron but even big iron these days uses power PC.

207
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:33,700
Speaker 0: yeah x86 because IBM still makes power PC and all that.

208
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:44,709
Speaker 0: but anyway yeah yeah the ps3 has the cell processor which we're not going to talk about in detail now we can do a show on it cuz it's pretty close to the power PC but not exactly well.

209
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:52,811
Speaker 0: I used to work in the factory at IBM that made him and in fact the people who made them were some of them used the computers that I designed and deployed and all that.

210
00:12:52,831 --> 00:12:53,533
Speaker 0: so that's kind of cool.

211
00:12:53,734 --> 00:13:03,366
Speaker 0: yeah but the cell like all things that are new and powerful and complicated is somewhat difficult to utilize fully.

212
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:12,164
Speaker 1: well the only thing that really matters to someone using Linux on a ps3 is the fact that cell is not power PC and it's not x86.

213
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:15,257
Speaker 0: you have to compile anything you want to run for cells.

214
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,396
Speaker 0: right the assembly instructions are for cell processors and not for x86 process.

215
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:23,616
Speaker 1: yes compiling is when you take source code and turn it into assembly instructions.

216
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:29,604
Speaker 0: instructions are just strings of ones and zeros that in the raw the processor sees and knows what to do with.

217
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:36,997
Speaker 1: yeah that's the actual you know if you take an exe file that's the stuff in there that talks to the processor directly.

218
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:39,674
Speaker 1: so if you have a different kind of processor you need to talk to it differently.

219
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:49,112
Speaker 1: so the Linux that they're giving you for it to run on the ps3 is already compiled into assembly instructions that can talk to a cell processor.

220
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:58,445
Speaker 1: so any software that is given to you by yellow dog Linux or whatever ps3 Linux they want to give you you know is going to work.

221
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:15,395
Speaker 1: but if you want to get some software like I don't know myth TV or your favorite NES emulator or something like that to run that normally runs on Linux on any of the computer you're gonna have to recompile it or find someone else who's already done it and is giving it to you.

222
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:25,699
Speaker 0: the other issue you're probably gonna run into is that yellow dog feels and works at least as far as I've interacted with it in recent memory like red hat.

223
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,512
Speaker 1: that's what yellow dog originally was red hat for power PC.

224
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:29,235
Speaker 0: that's all.

225
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:32,147
Speaker 0: it was not even like the new enterprise red hats.

226
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:40,961
Speaker 0: I'm talking like red hat nine where stuff just didn't work and if you want to do install software you had to find RPM.

227
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:43,955
Speaker 1: I think now it's more like a fedora closer to fedora.

228
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:44,317
Speaker 1: I don't know.

229
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:45,505
Speaker 1: it's changed a lot over the.

230
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:48,303
Speaker 0: I hope so because I've never heard anyone say anything good about yellow dog.

231
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:49,792
Speaker 0: no I mean I don't want to sound well.

232
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:53,732
Speaker 1: originally yellow dog Linux was the only Linux that worked on desktop.

233
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:56,321
Speaker 1: you know Mac power PC computers.

234
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:59,613
Speaker 1: now every distro under the Sun has done power PC.

235
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:07,402
Speaker 1: so yellow dog it makes sense that their new niche is going to the cell for the core processor not the cell not the core.

236
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:09,892
Speaker 1: the cell core it cores the Intel core.

237
00:15:09,912 --> 00:15:11,178
Speaker 1: it's an x86 anyway.

238
00:15:11,941 --> 00:15:13,025
Speaker 1: so that's the first problem.

239
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,802
Speaker 1: the second problem is the weird peripherals of the ps3.

240
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:18,711
Speaker 1: now I don't know the answers to these questions.

241
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:22,262
Speaker 1: but will the blu-ray drive work in the Linux?

242
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:24,388
Speaker 1: I don't know.

243
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:32,355
Speaker 1: but if it does then you're gonna have a good time watching blu-ray DVDs on your Linux powered ps3.

244
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:37,078
Speaker 1: if it doesn't you're gonna have a hard time because you can't put other stuff in there and make it work.

245
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:46,742
Speaker 0: I imagine it won't work or it'll take a lot of effort to make work because they really are probably worried about people ripping blu-ray movies and piracy and all that.

246
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:47,003
Speaker 1: yep.

247
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:51,564
Speaker 1: now the question number two will the wireless success controller work in Linux?

248
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:55,846
Speaker 1: if it does good times cuz you can use that controller to play all kinds of emulated games.

249
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,623
Speaker 1: if it doesn't work then what's really the point?

250
00:15:58,664 --> 00:15:59,690
Speaker 1: you might as well use a computer.

251
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,593
Speaker 1: why is ps3?

252
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:03,603
Speaker 1: will the HD output work?

253
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:10,112
Speaker 1: you know if you have a ps3 plugged into a TV and you want to use it as a computer you would hope that you would have HD output.

254
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:12,081
Speaker 1: seeing as the whole thing revolves around HD.

255
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:19,268
Speaker 1: if it only outputs in normal TV resolution when running Linux then really you could use a computer.

256
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:28,551
Speaker 0: my guess is going to be that again anything HD is going to be internally encrypted with bullshit and it'll be really hard to make it work with your Linux.

257
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:32,526
Speaker 1: yeah who knows what else there's questions of?

258
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:35,196
Speaker 1: like the net is this have a wire ps3 of wireless?

259
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:37,063
Speaker 0: yeah yeah something like that.

260
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:40,196
Speaker 1: it has a network card of some sort wireless or wired.

261
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:41,723
Speaker 1: you know is that gonna work?

262
00:16:41,864 --> 00:16:43,895
Speaker 1: probably if it's wired it probably does.

263
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,363
Speaker 1: the real answer is who knows?

264
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:46,952
Speaker 0: you want to know what you should really do.

265
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,062
Speaker 0: just wait if it's feasible.

266
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:57,977
Speaker 0: if this is gonna work they're going to make it work and someone on slash now to say hey we got it to work and at that point get your ps3 install Linux on it.

267
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:02,196
Speaker 1: until then you're because his is where I'm kind of torn the ps3.

268
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:04,385
Speaker 1: you look at it and you say $600.

269
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:05,529
Speaker 1: look at those crap games.

270
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:11,453
Speaker 1: it looks like the PSP all over again only not portable all right and people are going crazy over it.

271
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:34,784
Speaker 1: whatever but as a computer running Linux if it has HD outputs if the blu-ray drive works if the network card works if the six axis controllers work if all those things work and their people start porting lots of software over to the cell processor and you it becomes very easy to cross compile existing open source software to the cell processor for 600 bucks.

272
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,735
Speaker 1: that's a pretty fast computer.

273
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:42,232
Speaker 0: you got there except that it's not upgradeable that's true.

274
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,827
Speaker 0: it's probably not that powerful we don't know yet.

275
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:46,912
Speaker 0: we got to wait for more information.

276
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:55,604
Speaker 1: but I think the real problem with the power is you have to wait for GCC to know or code for what.

277
00:17:55,644 --> 00:18:01,610
Speaker 0: I've been reading a lot of articles about but I want to get more articles because I haven't seen enough to convince me yet.

278
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:06,774
Speaker 0: but a lot of developers have been talking about how the way the cell processors work.

279
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:10,188
Speaker 0: there's a really big memory access constraint.

280
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:38,684
Speaker 0: that's causing a lot of trouble for them and I saw a few websites claim that one of the reasons a lot of the earlier games coming out are 720p instead of 1080 is because they can't make the game run smoothly in 1080 because the textures are too big to use them properly in the RAM and also that a couple of the cell processors are pretty much always busy dealing with internal ps3 shit and all sorts of problems with the whole parallel architecture.

281
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:40,793
Speaker 1: well the other oh here's another thing.

282
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:45,212
Speaker 1: will the 3d powerful you know the 3d chip work in Linux you know?

283
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:50,633
Speaker 1: will you be able to run GLX SDL type things or will you just be stuck with 2d?

284
00:18:50,773 --> 00:19:04,098
Speaker 1: and also computer processors are getting faster at a very fast rate still yeah so it really comes down to how much of the hardware in the ps3 does the ps3 Linux support?

285
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:12,683
Speaker 1: and if the if it does support all the hardware is that worth $600 compared to a $600 computer that you can buy a new egg?

286
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:12,744
Speaker 1: in

287
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:34,077
Speaker 0: my professional opinion as an IT guy who was worked for large companies for many years I would say this is my opinion that by the time people have figured out the ps3 enough to utilize it to its fullest regular computers will already be far faster than the ps3.

288
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:47,425
Speaker 1: yeah but there are a few things though that it still might be worth it even if it's not faster because you do have that HD output and you do have the blu-ray drive one.

289
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:50,841
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone will get those to work in any reasonable span of time.

290
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,067
Speaker 1: they might already be working.

291
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:53,794
Speaker 1: I haven't done the research well.

292
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:58,633
Speaker 0: more importantly even if they work most people don't care about that.

293
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:03,298
Speaker 1: and well those people don't care about a ps3 in the first place because ps3 is all about HD.

294
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:07,237
Speaker 1: if you don't have an HD TV and you don't care about HD you don't care about ps3.

295
00:20:07,418 --> 00:20:10,993
Speaker 0: but what most most people don't have HD yes I don't care about ps3.

296
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:13,747
Speaker 1: yeah this is only for people who care about ps3.

297
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:19,534
Speaker 0: there aren't that many people trying to make all this stuff work because I don't think that many people care.

298
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:24,653
Speaker 0: and I really think that blu-ray is not going to make it in the end.

299
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:25,256
Speaker 1: I don't think either.

300
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:28,352
Speaker 0: one of those things I'm not saying HD DVD will.

301
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:29,678
Speaker 0: I think it has a better chance.

302
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:38,251
Speaker 1: but the thing about blu-ray is it even if it doesn't quote make it as a movie disc or even as a popular disc at all for any use.

303
00:20:38,714 --> 00:20:43,674
Speaker 1: it is useful even if you're the only one in the whole world to use it for storing shit tons of data.

304
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:53,756
Speaker 0: the ps3 doesn't burn blu-rays it only plays them and if you get a drive that burns blu-rays for your computer then you can read them on your computer.

305
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:57,792
Speaker 0: now if the ps3 could burn blu-rays you're totally right.

306
00:20:57,812 --> 00:20:58,777
Speaker 0: I'm with you a hundred percent.

307
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:01,912
Speaker 1: but well you know no cuz here's the one thing right.

308
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:06,164
Speaker 1: hmm the ps3 is cheaper than a blu-ray player.

309
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:07,970
Speaker 0: right not by much.

310
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:10,059
Speaker 0: blu-ray players are pretty cheap yeah.

311
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:23,294
Speaker 1: but if you had something to burn blu-rays and you burn them but in a mesh in a computer you could then put them in your PlayStation 3 to watch them on your HD TV but you could watch them on your HD computer.

312
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,766
Speaker 1: yes you can watch blu-ray discs on the ps3 without Linux.

313
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:32,104
Speaker 0: so yeah yeah yeah plus I mean for all this talk of HD.

314
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:37,423
Speaker 0: everyone needs to remember that computers have effectively been HD for a long time.

315
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:47,465
Speaker 1: yes but the only way to actually get a computer to display an HD on an HD TV is instead of a computer monitor is if your HD TV has DVI input which some do.

316
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:48,810
Speaker 1: oh yeah only the good one.

317
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,270
Speaker 0: but you know what for us especially if you're living in a small house or a dorm.

318
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:57,128
Speaker 0: just get a 21 inch CRT and use that as your television and it'll be awesome.

319
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,806
Speaker 0: HD it will be awesome and it'll be a fraction of the price.

320
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,392
Speaker 0: there won't be any DRM.

321
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:07,227
Speaker 1: oh wait here's a reason to use the ps3 with the HD outputs.

322
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:16,183
Speaker 1: you could download using the ps3 in the network connection and Linux onto the hard drive HD stuff from the internet and then watch it on the TV.

323
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:28,500
Speaker 1: but the only way you can do that now is with the tricky myth TV setups with like hop edge car or or just watch it on your computer.

324
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,645
Speaker 1: yeah but even I don't.

325
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:32,169
Speaker 0: the only HD content.

326
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:34,661
Speaker 0: you can download our stupid movie trailers now.

327
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:37,475
Speaker 1: you can download lots of HD content not anything worthwhile.

328
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:39,626
Speaker 0: yeah lots of what what's worthwhile?

329
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,703
Speaker 1: all kinds of movies on bit torrent TV shows on bit torrent whatever.

330
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,558
Speaker 0: most I mean things on bit torrent most people they really.

331
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:49,563
Speaker 1: if we didn't have the Mac plugged into the TV I probably wouldn't watch anything we downloaded.

332
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,678
Speaker 1: I can't watch stuff on a computer screen one I can't.

333
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:53,369
Speaker 0: just fine cuz I got a pretty big computer screen.

334
00:22:54,213 --> 00:22:55,980
Speaker 1: yeah even so it's not.

335
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,731
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna like sit around a computer screen those days.

336
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:00,219
Speaker 1: that's for the college days.

337
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:02,129
Speaker 1: if you're in college it's great nowadays.

338
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:02,451
Speaker 1: no way.

339
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:08,739
Speaker 0: I just I think any buying the ps3 for any reason other than playing ps3 games in my opinion is really dumb.

340
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,188
Speaker 1: yeah it's pretty dumb but I'm just.

341
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,962
Speaker 1: I'm just giving people the facts about ps3 on Linux.

342
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:16,577
Speaker 0: I just don't think there's any useful purpose to doing that.

343
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,671
Speaker 1: there is a useful purpose for a few people who care anyway.

344
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,918
Speaker 1: yeah we're going to bed the info about the ps3 in Linux.
