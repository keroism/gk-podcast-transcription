1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,758
Speaker 0: It's Thursday December 7th.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,950
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and I'm rim and this is geek night tonight.

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,850
Speaker 0: We discuss gift giving and receiving.

4
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:20,965
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:33,000
Speaker 1: Well seeing is how the first annual geek nights Well, not really geek guys, but front row crew holiday party hosted by the Macross is is happening this weekend.

6
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:40,359
Speaker 1: Scott and I went out to buy our gifts for the secret Santa that is being run and boy Did we get some awesome shit?

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,059
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean driving up the road.

8
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:51,916
Speaker 1: You know on our way cuz we have to when we decide to go Consumering as opposed to just our normal shopping, you know Like going to the mall or go into those stores that sell coffee in addition to whatever they have.

9
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:52,880
Speaker 1: It's a deal.

10
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:53,647
Speaker 1: It's a big deal.

11
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:54,858
Speaker 1: Like we get ready we go.

12
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:58,420
Speaker 1: We venture out into consumer land with all the appropriate weapons.

13
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:06,200
Speaker 1: We shield ourselves from the horrible radiation of edge with our eyes and you know as we were driving up We didn't really know what to get.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:16,913
Speaker 1: we were kind of really at a loss as we'll talk about during the main bit, but once we got to a store and We started seeing items we could purchase and ways we could combine them.

15
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,627
Speaker 0: It really started to click Yeah on the way up.

16
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:23,160
Speaker 0: We said hey, why don't we go and check out that place?

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,411
Speaker 0: We hadn't been to in a while.

18
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:25,380
Speaker 0: or how about that place?

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,349
Speaker 0: You know because we got the road we want to.

20
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,077
Speaker 0: it takes a while to get up there like 10-15 minutes.

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,340
Speaker 0: So we want to make sure that if there's someplace to go up there We go there all at once to make as few trips as possible.

22
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:38,117
Speaker 0: And I don't think we're going back up there for a while.

23
00:01:38,137 --> 00:01:38,197
Speaker 0: god.

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,447
Speaker 1: No, not until after the new year at least.

25
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:44,040
Speaker 1: I will not go anywhere near a mall from this point forward me either.

26
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:54,917
Speaker 1: But not only do I have my secret Santa collection, but I have an entire Presentation ready as I will unveil each item and explain its purpose.

27
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,514
Speaker 0: Wow I I just got some really awesome stuff and I'm not gonna make a present.

28
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:06,979
Speaker 1: Scott stuff is pretty awesome And I hope that whoever gets it will allow us to use some of it in some way for a future.

29
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:07,380
Speaker 1: awesome.

30
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:17,020
Speaker 0: I just hope whoever gets it appreciates it because I know some people would appreciate that sort of thing and be like ah Yeah, and some people would be like WTF mate.

31
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:30,735
Speaker 1: Well, you know it's like at my work when I worked at IBM We did a secret Santa thing for the department holiday party which actually that was a really good time hanging out with those people and I Gave see a lot of people really like alcohol there.

32
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:35,520
Speaker 1: So I got a bunch of Alcohol, but not really there was actually no alcohol.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,820
Speaker 1: There were old wine and liquor bottles filled with water hidden in a bag.

34
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,160
Speaker 1: So it was obvious that it was liquor, but it wasn't really liquor.

35
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:45,257
Speaker 1: And hidden inside was an anime DVD.

36
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,360
Speaker 1: The guy you got it was kind of pissed.

37
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:54,800
Speaker 0: So in other words you were guaranteed to give anime to the biggest alcoholic there something like that.

38
00:02:55,861 --> 00:03:07,490
Speaker 1: Well, of course the other guy who knows a bit about geekery and all that who actually ended up with the anime DVD his gift was actually The Star Wars Christmas special in the Ewok adventure.

39
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,552
Speaker 0: He is the winner.

40
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,099
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone realized why that was funny except me.

41
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:14,276
Speaker 0: I'm sure they did once they tried to watch it.

42
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,490
Speaker 1: God I watched the Ewok adventure on TV.

43
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,554
Speaker 1: Wow.

44
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,438
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen it?

45
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:22,828
Speaker 0: Kind of it's just.

46
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:24,113
Speaker 0: I know what it looks like.

47
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,418
Speaker 1: It looks like he walks.

48
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,793
Speaker 1: Yes And kids have an adventure.

49
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:32,730
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so anyway, I'll let Scott do his news first.

50
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:35,940
Speaker 0: My news should have been a thing of the day, but it's Thursday.

51
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,648
Speaker 0: So you're basically getting two things of the day.

52
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:47,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had two news isn't two things of the day, but then Scott Discovered another thing of the day and there was no way to delay this.

53
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:56,160
Speaker 1: and in fact, I will say right now To anyone in the front row crew and extended front row crew is going to be at the Macross holiday extravaganza this weekend.

54
00:03:56,762 --> 00:04:07,020
Speaker 1: You will not say a word about Scott's thing of the day to anyone Unless you know that they have listened to this episode of geek nights because I imagine we are going to attempt this.

55
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,260
Speaker 1: But anyway, Scott can do his news first.

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, my news is apparently in Toronto where you do not want to go.

57
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:15,660
Speaker 1: I don't want to go to Toronto.

58
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,204
Speaker 0: I don't want to go.

59
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:18,589
Speaker 1: children do not have faces.

60
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:19,873
Speaker 1: They have cigarette ads.

61
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:20,474
Speaker 0: Yes.

62
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:21,999
Speaker 0: It is a bad place.

63
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:29,700
Speaker 0: And that tax on wicker goods, yes, I do not want to tax on my wicker good so I will not go to Toronto.

64
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:49,242
Speaker 0: I do not want this Unless it is this one specific case in which I would go to Toronto where they have not 100 not 200 250 no, but 1,200 people playing capture the flag downtown In

65
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,947
Speaker 1: in the streets running around

66
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:55,520
Speaker 0: as in exactly in the streets running around like lunatics.

67
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:59,453
Speaker 1: that sounds like unmitigated awesome.

68
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:02,931
Speaker 0: it Appears to be unmitigated awesome.

69
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,860
Speaker 0: It looks like unmitigated awesome.

70
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:13,900
Speaker 0: The idea is unmitigated awesome and for some people like us it would be unmitigated awesome But in reality it is mostly a fucking mess.

71
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:20,682
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's that good kind of mess that involves the crowds of people out in the street who aren't rioting Exactly.

72
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:26,804
Speaker 1: I mean if you see a crowd of people in the street like a big crowd of people standing on cars yelling Especially in the u.s.

73
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:31,519
Speaker 1: Setting fires to cars tipping them over odds are any group of people that's yelling is trouble.

74
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:41,140
Speaker 1: Seeing a group of people yelling that not only was not trouble but was in fact Anti trouble at least as far as I'm concerned probably not as far as the authorities were concerned.

75
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:47,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, either way capture the flag is awesome for many reasons and we should do a whole episode on capture the flag because I could.

76
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:53,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I'm gonna say is that I'm watching this video and I'm looking at their rules for capture the flag.

77
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,477
Speaker 0: You know, you can only have five people guarding the flag, etc, etc.

78
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,895
Speaker 0: They didn't have the best rules for a 1,200 man game.

79
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:05,060
Speaker 1: They probably didn't put that much thought into it compared to the amount of thought that should have been put into it.

80
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:14,549
Speaker 0: This was actually, you know, it was probably a better flash mob an idea that it was a game of capture the flag And I can't really blame them for that.

81
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:17,980
Speaker 1: Well capture the flag in its purest form Really?

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:35,451
Speaker 1: I mean unless you modify the rules or Do something fun like full contact or make the rules very clear and codified as to what constitutes someone being captured and Exactly what you have to do to get the flag and all those sorts of things The game ends up being a very arbitrary messive.

83
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,415
Speaker 1: I got you.

84
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:37,238
Speaker 1: now you didn't.

85
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:42,434
Speaker 0: yeah The best catch of the flag ever played was at summer camp, but that's a story for another time.

86
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:52,197
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll tell summer camp was fascist about its capture the flag which Ironically was called revolution and they play it on the 4th of July every year.

87
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:58,360
Speaker 1: Ooh Yeah, we played a lot at band camp and when I was a Cub Scout at a Boy Scout camp once that ended it.

88
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,328
Speaker 1: Well, we'll tell those stories on another day.

89
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:00,408
Speaker 0: Yes.

90
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:03,260
Speaker 0: Yeah along with some dodgeballs.

91
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:07,180
Speaker 1: Now the sad thing is it said well, I guess it's good for Canada.

92
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:15,739
Speaker 1: It says a lot about the people of Toronto even though their children have cigarette ads instead of faces They all wear three-piece suits and they carry black balloons.

93
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:29,086
Speaker 1: But in Toronto the fact that this flash mob happened and the riot squad didn't appear I mean this shit would not go down in the US if you tried to get this together on the streets of New York or LA or Detroit

94
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,827
Speaker 0: not in a smaller city like a Rochester or Buffalo.

95
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:44,560
Speaker 1: police would be there in a second and even if they didn't bust heads thinking it was a riot They would probably cite you for creating a public nuisance or a danger or there'd be liability issues.

96
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,764
Speaker 1: You'd all get sued.

97
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:57,974
Speaker 0: I can almost guarantee that someone would be in jail not prison not prison But jail like in the police station overnight for a few hours Yeah, I would pretty much put the odds of that at a hundred to zero.

98
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:06,758
Speaker 1: yeah so I can use the nullity Right Cuz I got some actual news here.

99
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:25,475
Speaker 1: so a lot of us in the IT and CS world and basically a lot of people in the corporate world have realized that for the most part the corporate world is a scam in that your job performance is Generally tied to how many hours you work and how many asses you kiss as opposed to how good you are.

100
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:42,398
Speaker 1: Yes now doubly, so is the problem that let's say you're really really good at your job and They would give you an assignment that they assume would take I don't know 16 hours to and some and change full working days to complete.

101
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,000
Speaker 1: now Let's say you're an intellectual powerhouse and you complete that job in a half hour.

102
00:08:48,562 --> 00:09:00,040
Speaker 1: Now in the current corporate world your options at this point if you don't have other projects to work on is to Sit there and look busy because if they know that you're not working, they'll think you're a slacker.

103
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:01,860
Speaker 1: They won't think oh, I should give him more work.

104
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:11,402
Speaker 1: They'll just think you're a slacker and if you leave early, they'll probably fire you Mm-hmm now and if you start doing things that aren't work, hey, they'll fire you Yep.

105
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:14,680
Speaker 1: Now a lot of companies handle this in better ways like IBM where I worked.

106
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,500
Speaker 1: It was it wasn't full flex time or anything.

107
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,880
Speaker 1: But there was generally this sense of show up when you need to leave when you need to if you get your work done.

108
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:24,466
Speaker 1: That's great.

109
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:25,679
Speaker 1: And that's all we care about.

110
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,089
Speaker 1: So you work long hours when long hours were needed.

111
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,999
Speaker 1: you leave early when you've done everything and there's nothing to do.

112
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:40,820
Speaker 1: Some companies take it a lot further and say that you can work whatever Hours you want at any time during the week as long as you put in your 40 hours over the course of the week.

113
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:52,360
Speaker 1: Best buy of all companies has taken this perhaps to the most awesome extent It could be taken and I will wait anxiously for the results of this widespread social experiment.

114
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:55,320
Speaker 1: You see in their corporate headquarters, they're experimenting.

115
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:04,735
Speaker 1: Apparently they've been doing this on different scales for some time with total flex time Not even work whenever you want as long as you get your 40 hours in it's purely.

116
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,500
Speaker 1: you have a list of tasks.

117
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,251
Speaker 1: Complete these tasks.

118
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:15,797
Speaker 1: That is all Wow, so if you decide to work, you know 12 hours Monday and Wednesday.

119
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:16,800
Speaker 1: get all your work done.

120
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:24,136
Speaker 1: Maybe you show up Friday morning for a meeting once a week And other than that, you don't work as long as you're completing all the tasks you're assigned.

121
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:25,220
Speaker 1: They don't care.

122
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,099
Speaker 1: In fact, they're heavy with you because all they want is the work.

123
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:32,635
Speaker 1: They don't care to have you in the office wasting your time and their time doing nothing.

124
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:37,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't If I had that job, that'd be the best job in the whole world.

125
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:40,840
Speaker 0: I basically do all the work as quickly as I possibly could working.

126
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,485
Speaker 0: You know reasonable hour days.

127
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:52,019
Speaker 0: if I couldn't if they gave me more work that I could finish in a few eight hour days You know from working nine to five with an hour lunch break, then there's a problem getting too much work.

128
00:10:52,922 --> 00:11:03,960
Speaker 0: But if I could finish the work, which I bet I could I just wouldn't come back in unless there's a meeting and I'd wear some sort of Emailing mobile device to know if I had to do anything.

129
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:12,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that's the one thing I miss about IBM that now that I'm working in other industries I can't really work from home and I can't.

130
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:21,100
Speaker 1: Most of my throughput and output is more dependent upon other people and them actually doing their piece of something than on my awesome.

131
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:30,599
Speaker 1: I can do all of my work in fairly short order and It would be great if I could just leave work early whenever I wanted but yet still show up when I need to do work.

132
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:41,599
Speaker 1: hmm and Best buy seems to be having a lot of success with this and I don't see too many drawbacks other than Obviously, you'll probably have some people who will scam the system and not do any work.

133
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:49,435
Speaker 0: You'll obviously have some people who you know You'll quickly realize people who aren't coming in don't have enough work to do.

134
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:55,100
Speaker 0: You'll give them more work You know, which is not the greatest always because you might give them too much work and such.

135
00:11:55,401 --> 00:12:02,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the way around that is say you've already got a level of productivity with your current In a I don't know nine to five eight to four hours.

136
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:06,392
Speaker 1: So you don't ever assign more work than that.

137
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,860
Speaker 1: You already have a baseline that works for your company.

138
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:15,939
Speaker 1: So by providing the flex time and asking for the same amount of work All you're doing is making happier more productive employees as a whole.

139
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:20,200
Speaker 1: I'll bet they'll end up doing more work just because they have the freedom.

140
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:28,880
Speaker 1: Yeah If I knew I could leave work whenever I wanted and show up whenever I wanted I'd be much less averse to pulling late hours when they needed it and just making the time up later.

141
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,870
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm on the other hand though.

142
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,920
Speaker 0: I could see a problem in this system.

143
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:35,660
Speaker 0: You're really dependent on having your managers be smart.

144
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:46,380
Speaker 0: for example if we were managed by someone in a system like this and we got all our work done in like Really quickly and the manager was dumb and he sees that we don't show up for two weeks.

145
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,003
Speaker 0: He's like, huh?

146
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:49,234
Speaker 0: Those guys don't have any work to do.

147
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:50,580
Speaker 0: I don't have any work for them to do.

148
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,671
Speaker 0: They haven't been here in two weeks.

149
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:52,480
Speaker 0: What do we need them for?

150
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,059
Speaker 0: Let's fire them and then they've just fired the smartest people there.

151
00:12:55,401 --> 00:13:01,200
Speaker 1: Well, see this what the smart people do is you figure out right away Who the smart people are in your organization?

152
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:11,110
Speaker 1: Who you need to actually care about and who you can ignore and most importantly whether or not your direct report boss is smart or not And you tailor your activities accordingly.

153
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:13,720
Speaker 1: if they are smart you do exactly what you would have done.

154
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:27,022
Speaker 1: Anyway, if they're not smart you uh pad it out and you finish the work, but you turn it in Way late when it was expected to be turned in and you show up occasionally and pay lip service to the fact that you might Be working.

155
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:28,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just hate having to do shit like that.

156
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you'd have to do it a lot less under the system.

157
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:31,369
Speaker 0: It's true.

158
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:34,448
Speaker 0: It's true and you know what the best part is.

159
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:39,805
Speaker 0: I can actually fucking get shit done like cleaning the house or Doing laundry.

160
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:45,580
Speaker 1: I get the feeling that people who don't do or people have trouble with work.

161
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:52,525
Speaker 1: You know people who a lot of people who do work at jobs as opposed to people like us Many cases don't have to do so much.

162
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:56,275
Speaker 1: They actually do need the full 40 hours to do their given job.

163
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:57,317
Speaker 0: Some people do.

164
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:57,357
Speaker 0: I

165
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:12,526
Speaker 1: Think most of the people I've worked with in the course of my life have used most of the time Doing the same amount of work I did but they took the full 40 hours and I would usually do it in a lot less time Or they'd be really slow about it.

166
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:30,599
Speaker 1: Like we need this done and they won't just immediately get out it and finish it right away They'll be like, okay, and then a week later they'll look at it and then a couple days later They'll go out and look at the place They're supposed to do the thing and then they'll go to the water cooler and talk for a while And then they'll just do a voltage of BS and finish the work, you know a month later

167
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:31,263
Speaker 0: Yeah,

168
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:31,825
Speaker 1: I'll.

169
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:34,457
Speaker 1: literally if I'm given an assignment I do it as fast as possible.

170
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:35,120
Speaker 1: So I'm done with it.

171
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,407
Speaker 1: I don't have to care about it anymore.

172
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:37,051
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

173
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:38,660
Speaker 0: I wish I had assignments.

174
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,531
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually works really ramping up.

175
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:44,704
Speaker 1: They're starting to give me actual Interesting work to do.

176
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,089
Speaker 1: I've been rather pleased with this.

177
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:56,006
Speaker 1: I hope this trend continues until you finish all the work Yeah, but even when I finish all the work if I ask for more work I've been given it in recent memory You got to be careful.

178
00:14:56,046 --> 00:15:00,920
Speaker 0: if your company just turns into a bunch of people who outsource all the labor You might end up doing the work of the whole company.

179
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:01,906
Speaker 1: You know what.

180
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:04,299
Speaker 1: then I'll demand a huge raise because I now have a high truck factor.

181
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:05,810
Speaker 0: I just demand to be to see.

182
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,280
Speaker 0: you'd be like I do all the work here.

183
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,185
Speaker 0: I should be in charge.

184
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:08,908
Speaker 0: make me the CEO.

185
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,120
Speaker 1: actually the CEO is pretty smart.

186
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,159
Speaker 1: I gotta hand it to him and he's here.

187
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,870
Speaker 1: Honestly, he's a lot smarter than some of the upper management.

188
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,235
Speaker 1: I have met in other companies.

189
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:18,938
Speaker 1: I've worked for.

190
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,540
Speaker 0: that's cool.

191
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,020
Speaker 1: So I have no beef with him.

192
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,520
Speaker 1: I wouldn't want to be in charge of the company because I don't know enough about business to do that.

193
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,067
Speaker 0: I'm sure you'd want to make his monies.

194
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:27,112
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

195
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd be happy to be the CIO.

196
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you made his money's like I could just stop working.

197
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,135
Speaker 0: We could all stop working and we could just podcast all day.

198
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:35,100
Speaker 0: We had bunnies.

199
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:39,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, or maybe some radio station will pick us up and we'll go pro and that'll be the end of that.

200
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:52,400
Speaker 1: Well, I You can't do ten atomic sit-ups You don't want to do even one.

201
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:55,149
Speaker 1: So tell us about your thing of the day Scott.

202
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,640
Speaker 0: Okay, my thing is better than yours, so I should go second.

203
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:58,927
Speaker 1: Oh, you want me to go first?

204
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:01,420
Speaker 0: You want to do an atomic sit-up first be my guest.

205
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:02,886
Speaker 0: I'm not doing any.

206
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:03,410
Speaker 1: so.

207
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:04,980
Speaker 1: a small town somewhere.

208
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:10,419
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna bore you with all the intimate details of this story because the overall message is the important part.

209
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:17,560
Speaker 1: The basic gist of it is that a town had a backpack mail system where kids going to school.

210
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:23,220
Speaker 1: They would come home like once a week with a folder with flyers and announcements and stuff from the town.

211
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,309
Speaker 1: You know community groups the city government all those things.

212
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:28,416
Speaker 1: they would send information home with school kids.

213
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,383
Speaker 0: when I was in elementary school We did that.

214
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:34,866
Speaker 0: you'd get all kinds of flyers that you would bring home and you know Most of them you just threw out.

215
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:38,120
Speaker 0: but some of them are important like the Little League sign-up sheet and stuff like that.

216
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:43,213
Speaker 1: So a long time ago since this town is very small and super Christian and conservative.

217
00:16:43,695 --> 00:17:05,147
Speaker 1: a lot of the church groups got together and along with help from Jerry Falwell's organizations and various groups like that put forth lawsuits and demanded that local churches and local religious groups be able to use this system because it's open to the community as a community service and therefore They shouldn't exclude religious things from that.

218
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,579
Speaker 1: the town caved in instead of fighting and just let them do it.

219
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:09,944
Speaker 0: See our town.

220
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:13,099
Speaker 0: I don't think religious stuff went out in the school papers.

221
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:16,010
Speaker 1: Oh, no, but this town allowed it under the guise of free religion.

222
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:17,053
Speaker 0: All right, whatever.

223
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,036
Speaker 1: That's not the story.

224
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:27,089
Speaker 1: this year A local pagan group decided to send out their flyer through the thing advertising a Yule Festival.

225
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:35,357
Speaker 1: for anyone who was interested in learning about alternative Cultures and the way they celebrate holidays around Christmas, you know a really cool thing for those types of people.

226
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:41,837
Speaker 1: the Christians in the town are Super super crazily outraged about this.

227
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:46,907
Speaker 1: Yes So the town came back and said well You're the ones who allow this to happen.

228
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:49,335
Speaker 1: either all religions get it or none of them.

229
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:50,500
Speaker 1: Do you decide?

230
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:53,230
Speaker 1: Huzzah, and that's it.

231
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,680
Speaker 1: I just find it utterly hilarious.

232
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:59,400
Speaker 1: It is not often that you see someone so duly and dutifully hoisted by their own petard.

233
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:06,347
Speaker 0: We should need to send out some atheist flyers home with the kiddies Except our town doesn't do anything like that.

234
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:07,371
Speaker 1: So we don't have to worry.

235
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:08,837
Speaker 1: We already won that battle.

236
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:09,519
Speaker 1: Hooray.

237
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:29,420
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I had never before today heard of that which is known as the atomic sit-up and I am sorry That I have not for if I had learned it many years before if I mean if I had learned this in middle school There are probably like a hundred opportunities in my life to do this to people who wouldn't have known what was coming

238
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:30,586
Speaker 1: God and it

239
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:35,400
Speaker 0: would have been the most hilarious thing ever because I would have been the guy Who does the atomic sit-up to people?

240
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Speaker 1: It's almost as bad as the guys in my high school who got people to do the elephant dance all the time.

241
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,964
Speaker 0: Where's the elephant dance?

242
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,380
Speaker 1: The elephant dance is too complicated to explain without diagrams.

243
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,954
Speaker 0: All right, as long as it's not as bad as the cookie we can let it go.

244
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,097
Speaker 1: It's nothing like that.

245
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:59,380
Speaker 1: All right, so Before Scott goes on I just want to say again to any front row crew members and friends We're going to be at the Macross party.

246
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:11,959
Speaker 1: Don't mention to anyone what an atomic sit-up is or act like, you know, and like it's not a big deal Because depending on the crowd and the circumstances we might attempt this.

247
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:16,814
Speaker 0: It'll probably require some people to be slightly intoxicated, but that will just make it better.

248
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,620
Speaker 1: It's Scott Johnson Scott.

249
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's not even gonna be there.

250
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:20,528
Speaker 0: No, he's not.

251
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:20,729
Speaker 0: Huh?

252
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:31,956
Speaker 0: So the I will describe to you now What an atomic sit-up is and you will watch this College humor video to get the full effect of just how hilarious this can be.

253
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:32,960
Speaker 1: you can't do ten of them.

254
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:34,006
Speaker 0: No, you can't.

255
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,240
Speaker 0: this is how you do an atomic sit-up.

256
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,661
Speaker 0: You're ready.

257
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:47,478
Speaker 0: first you find someone who is reasonably athletic and wants to take a dare, you know in this video They use military man, and you say I bet you can't do an atomic sit-up.

258
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:49,304
Speaker 0: and they go What's an atomic sit-up?

259
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:51,611
Speaker 0: and you can't eat a hundred peeps exactly.

260
00:19:52,173 --> 00:20:00,425
Speaker 0: and you say this is what you tell them that All they have to do is do a sit-up while you hold their head down to the ground with like a towel over their Eyes or something like that.

261
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:06,097
Speaker 0: All right or a pillow on their faces, you know, not suffocating them Just like the top of their head and they you know.

262
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,287
Speaker 0: so you get them lying on the ground.

263
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:18,834
Speaker 0: you make sure they put their arms down on the ground and their knees are up and You hold their feet down like they're gonna do a sit-up and then you take a towel or a t-shirt And you put it over their eyes and you hold their head against the ground.

264
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:19,095
Speaker 0: right.

265
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:19,919
Speaker 1: so far so good.

266
00:20:20,643 --> 00:20:21,990
Speaker 0: Here's the part where you trick them.

267
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,372
Speaker 0: You're ready.

268
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:22,975
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

269
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:25,042
Speaker 0: You can't spoil someone.

270
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:36,740
Speaker 0: a daring person hopefully a fat person fatter the better will stand and Straddle the person laying down and reveal their buttocks in a prime position.

271
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:48,257
Speaker 0: Then you say alright go and the person will attempt to sit up Not being able to see and you will resist their head with the towel or a t-shirt or whatnot.

272
00:20:48,798 --> 00:21:01,509
Speaker 0: then as Their face is pushing towards the buttocks you release said shirt or towel sending their face into yon crack of doom releasing much hilarity for all.

273
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:07,268
Speaker 1: now the scream of humor and Horror that comes from this group of people.

274
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:09,374
Speaker 0: what you have is humor and horror.

275
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:10,457
Speaker 0: both are key.

276
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:14,913
Speaker 1: I Seeing this live is one of my life's minor ambitions.

277
00:21:14,953 --> 00:21:30,578
Speaker 1: now, I agree though I'm going to go one step further and I think that perhaps the perfect thing to add to this is just the barest barest touch of chocolate pudding real chocolate pudding to the affected area so that the person goes.

278
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:38,660
Speaker 1: ah And I realized that instinctually I would reach for my face and wipe it off is kind of a I don't know primitive cleansing measure.

279
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:51,409
Speaker 1: If I was subject to this joke and I did that and my butt my face touched someone's butt in that manner You know the nose basically going between the cheeks I would immediately grab my nose between my cheeks.

280
00:21:51,810 --> 00:22:03,020
Speaker 1: now if I pulled my hand away from my face and saw Anything that hinted at any sort of contamination of any kind I would probably vomit.

281
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:06,925
Speaker 1: This is comedy gold.

282
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,651
Speaker 0: it is comedy gold.

283
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:11,159
Speaker 0: indeed college humor is the win.

284
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:12,286
Speaker 1: I mean what?

285
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:14,680
Speaker 0: where the atomic sit-up this weekend?

286
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:16,664
Speaker 0: I hope not.

287
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:20,219
Speaker 0: I hope there are plenty of people who don't listen to this episode so that we can pull it off.

288
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:25,491
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway our main bit today.

289
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:26,554
Speaker 1: we were inspired.

290
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:27,637
Speaker 1: I mean we had a whole other thing.

291
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:31,629
Speaker 1: we were gonna talk about Self-appraisal and how important that is.

292
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:38,495
Speaker 1: now a lot of people are bad at it and now there's scientific evidence Pointing to why people are bad at it, but I'm not gonna talk about that.

293
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:39,740
Speaker 1: That's too serious and real.

294
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:48,393
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about holiday gifts because as we said before we spent the last couple hours seeking out Holiday gifts for a secret Santa.

295
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:49,520
Speaker 1: that is supposed to be funny.

296
00:22:49,962 --> 00:22:59,479
Speaker 0: Well, I think there's a one thing that I really want to discuss and that Mostly personally is the worst thing that can possibly happen in terms of gifts.

297
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:02,070
Speaker 0: You see I'm not big on the gifts.

298
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:06,360
Speaker 0: I mean when I was a kid sure I love getting toys cuz I didn't have money and I you know.

299
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,657
Speaker 0: But now I have money and I buy myself almost everything I want so I don't care about gifts so much.

300
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:18,400
Speaker 0: However Almost the worst thing in the world is when someone gets me a gift that I don't want.

301
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:28,565
Speaker 0: You know cuz I don't want to return it and I hate being dishonest and Saying I like it when I don't because that usually means I'm gonna get more of it And I also.

302
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:29,529
Speaker 1: it's just like.

303
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,260
Speaker 0: I also hate being honest and saying this sucks.

304
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,220
Speaker 0: You suck buying me gifts when someone was trying to do good.

305
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:46,100
Speaker 1: It's just like the old episode of Andy Griffith where aunt B makes her famous pickles and they taste like kerosene Exactly and no one wants to eat him but then and veal feel bad.

306
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:56,240
Speaker 1: So they decide the solution is to eat all the pickles and act like they love him and eat so many of them That she runs out of pickles and isn't able to enter the pickles in the pickle contest.

307
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:01,570
Speaker 1: Therefore she's happy that people liked her pickles, but yet no one else is subject to them And then they won't have to eat them ever again.

308
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:02,295
Speaker 0: So she makes more.

309
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:06,170
Speaker 1: Yes She makes a lot more because they liked him so much exactly.

310
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,180
Speaker 0: So what do you do in this situation personally?

311
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:17,000
Speaker 0: I haven't done this yet So I don't know how it'll work out But I'm thinking about taking a policy because it works for my mom.

312
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,530
Speaker 0: Like if you get my mom a gift she doesn't like she'll.

313
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:27,173
Speaker 0: she won't actually be like, oh, I love it She'll be kind of like And no one seems to have a problem with that.

314
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:27,837
Speaker 0: Maybe that's cuz.

315
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:28,440
Speaker 0: she's a Jewish mom.

316
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,460
Speaker 1: I was about to say she can get away with it.

317
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,800
Speaker 0: It's because she's a Jewish mommy and somehow if you get her a gift she doesn't want it's your fault.

318
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:37,040
Speaker 0: So I got to try and make people feel like that.

319
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:44,248
Speaker 0: I got to make people feel guilty for getting the bad gift as opposed to Feeling bad when someone gives me the bad gift.

320
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:45,412
Speaker 0: I got to do the reversal.

321
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:46,355
Speaker 0: What do you think?

322
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:51,220
Speaker 1: See honestly That hasn't happened to me in a long time.

323
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,409
Speaker 1: I mean it used to happen occasionally when I was.

324
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,739
Speaker 0: it hasn't happened to me much, but it does happen.

325
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:58,168
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is gifts have my.

326
00:24:58,348 --> 00:25:04,660
Speaker 1: the way I receive gifts and the way gifts work in my life has changed a lot since I you know moved out of my family's house when I was in high school.

327
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:10,480
Speaker 1: See now I really generally dislike giving gifts because of a holiday.

328
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:15,465
Speaker 1: Like I hate it when I'm obligated to give a gift like oh, it's Christmas me I have to get you a gift.

329
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:23,088
Speaker 0: an arbitrary date on the calendar is not a reason that I should be somehow forced to Give someone money or goods or service.

330
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:25,797
Speaker 1: that it's more that I get people gifts fairly often.

331
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:26,700
Speaker 1: I like getting people gifts.

332
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,138
Speaker 1: I like buying things that people like or getting someone something that I know they'd like.

333
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:34,000
Speaker 1: but I Hate it when I have to give a gift when I'm not inspired to give one.

334
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:44,740
Speaker 1: I don't have a thing in mind already Like if I see something that I know someone's really gonna like and I want to get it for him I just get it like alright, this would be great and it might be like the middle of March.

335
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,859
Speaker 1: I don't know and I just give him this gift like hey check this out.

336
00:25:47,402 --> 00:26:00,203
Speaker 1: But if it's suddenly Christmas and I don't have anything in particular to buy them It seems like anything I get would be hollow Because I kind of just bought it because it was the holiday as opposed to buying it because I knew it was something they really Desired.

337
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:05,360
Speaker 0: I think that's also partially because the holidays are hollow to us because we don't give a shit about them.

338
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:17,904
Speaker 0: But to someone who cares about the holidays the gift won't be hollow, you know I mean, it'll still be hollow to us because we'll still feel like it's a gift with nothing But that nothing when they get the gift will be filled with this holiday They care about.

339
00:26:17,964 --> 00:26:18,848
Speaker 1: don't be using the royal.

340
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:23,271
Speaker 1: we here I as even though, you know, it's super atheist I am I still like Christmas.

341
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:23,794
Speaker 1: It's a real.

342
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:24,640
Speaker 1: it's a good time of the year.

343
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:35,580
Speaker 1: it always meant getting together with friends and family and having a good time and eating a lot of food and I don't even mind Christmas gifts, especially in the manner that we are giving gifts this weekend, but we'll talk about that later.

344
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:46,319
Speaker 1: yeah, well That's something different and like Thanksgiving I celebrate and a few Bert will actually only one Maybe two birthdays do I actually celebrate and no one of them is not my own.

345
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:48,848
Speaker 0: I'm not really a fan of birthdays either.

346
00:26:48,868 --> 00:27:02,386
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is and this will sound bad, but last year I Honestly forgot about my birthday yeah, and I just went to work and I did all my business and I came home and someone mentioned that was my birthday and I was like what.

347
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,702
Speaker 1: Oh crap it is Like.

348
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:11,139
Speaker 1: once I turned 22, I just stopped paying attention and I often forget within one year how old I am.

349
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:14,432
Speaker 0: I forgot how old I was for a while like between 23 and 24.

350
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:20,282
Speaker 0: It was like Now I'm currently 24 we're 24.

351
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:21,406
Speaker 0: We're almost 25.

352
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,050
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be 25 in January.

353
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:24,234
Speaker 0: I mean 25 in April.

354
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:24,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're young ins.

355
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,220
Speaker 0: Not really now.

356
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're pretty young.

357
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:30,116
Speaker 1: We're only a quarter maybe a third of the way through our life.

358
00:27:30,136 --> 00:27:30,980
Speaker 0: It feels like yesterday.

359
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,020
Speaker 0: I was like, ah, there's no way it's gonna be forever until my car insurance gets cheaper.

360
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,268
Speaker 0: Now my car insurance you deeper in like five months.

361
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,360
Speaker 1: I feel like like a week ago.

362
00:27:41,882 --> 00:27:45,260
Speaker 1: I was in high school thinking wow, the good days will never end.

363
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:53,566
Speaker 1: I can't imagine having a real job somewhere or having responsibility and it seems like five minutes ago I was at RIT going.

364
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:55,254
Speaker 1: these are the best days of my life.

365
00:27:55,314 --> 00:28:00,757
Speaker 1: Fuck if they're ever gonna end Game over.

366
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,587
Speaker 1: See that's why we're doing this podcast.

367
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:05,290
Speaker 1: geek nights.

368
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,675
Speaker 1: for us is just a continue.

369
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:13,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, hopefully It's more like putting quarters in a different game because one machine broke.

370
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,570
Speaker 0: I thought we could play Dig Dug forever.

371
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,260
Speaker 0: But no now we must play Galaxian.

372
00:28:17,543 --> 00:28:32,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, though to be perfectly honest I would say that my life and probably your life too are just as good as they were in college just in Different ways like some areas on the web graph That is our lives went down and others went up and the same area is covered by the graph.

373
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,299
Speaker 0: I like those other areas better.

374
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,502
Speaker 0: Maybe.

375
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:37,879
Speaker 1: see remember what areas do we have now that we didn't have before?

376
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:43,097
Speaker 1: Lottie money fans every convention we ever wanted to go to?

377
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:45,618
Speaker 0: No homework.

378
00:28:46,401 --> 00:28:49,258
Speaker 1: Remember as much as we loved college and as awesome as it was.

379
00:28:49,821 --> 00:29:01,139
Speaker 1: Remember though when we paid for all that all that slacking off at the end of the quarter where there would be two weeks straight Of us doing homework and labs, you know, I just really don't remember the homework like everything was easy.

380
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:04,137
Speaker 0: Anyway, every now and then talk about some gifts some more.

381
00:29:04,258 --> 00:29:08,736
Speaker 1: Yeah But it just it's hard for me to give a gift if I'm not inspired to get a gift like.

382
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:14,546
Speaker 1: I'll see something and think Wow, that'd be the perfect gift for so-and-so and Then I get it for him.

383
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:15,169
Speaker 0: Yep.

384
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,160
Speaker 0: I did the same thing only don't actually buy it.

385
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,380
Speaker 0: I tell someone else to buy it.

386
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:29,247
Speaker 1: He luckily and I'm very glad that a while ago for the most part my family used to always send me cards and gifts even after I'd graduated college and Over time they've stopped doing.

387
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:35,320
Speaker 1: I mean I still talk to my family a lot and I want to visit them and fly out to Arizona and fly out to Michigan and have them come out here and all that.

388
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,641
Speaker 1: I talked to my grandpa as often as I can and I like my family But I don't like the whole gift thing like.

389
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:49,089
Speaker 1: I hate it when a relative I haven't talked to in a long time sends me a check for 20 bucks or Mails me just like a Christmas card that they signed.

390
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

391
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:52,800
Speaker 1: it doesn't feel like that means anything to me at all.

392
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,245
Speaker 0: Yeah cards or something else.

393
00:29:54,285 --> 00:30:00,460
Speaker 0: I mean my mom always see she's got like this hang up with the cards, you know It's like whenever it was any kind of thing.

394
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,110
Speaker 0: She would always call me and be like, you know, it's such-and-such send a card, you know It's such-and-such send a car.

395
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:06,400
Speaker 1: See I don't do the card thing anymore.

396
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:11,640
Speaker 1: Oh if I want to if I have a holiday thing, I'll call someone or I'll call people or maybe I'll give them a gift.

397
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,228
Speaker 1: But I'm never just gonna send it.

398
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,133
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll write a letter.

399
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:18,810
Speaker 1: a letter is fine But a hallmark card to me is just like.

400
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:24,008
Speaker 0: well the most the biggest thing I have against the cards is that you're paying $4 for a piece of cardboard.

401
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:26,900
Speaker 0: some I mean if they're on sale $2 for a piece of cardboard.

402
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:27,302
Speaker 0: Now

403
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:43,900
Speaker 1: that's not to say that I haven't gotten some very awesome cards in my day But I will say that every card I've gotten that I cared about Wasn't just some hallmark card that someone signed like I'm holding one right now that I got from Emily a while ago and it's actually a whole letter in here just happens to be on a card and that is awesome.

404
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:49,840
Speaker 1: I but a lot of relatives seem to just send me a hallmark card with maybe a really lame joke on the front.

405
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:58,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of the jokes are funny But if I wanted to be entertained like that I could read a webcomic or I could just go to the card store and read the cards.

406
00:30:59,202 --> 00:31:02,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean maybe it's it's the 90% of the cards are lame.

407
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:09,500
Speaker 1: See once I got to college I stopped celebrating most holidays other than you know, like around Christmas time.

408
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,660
Speaker 1: I'd go see my family, but I wouldn't celebrate Christmas.

409
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:27,960
Speaker 1: I just celebrate being with my family and that was the time I went to see them and then I moved out of college and I stopped even celebrating that I really the only holidays I celebrate are yellow the sky day international talk like a pirate day Thanksgiving because Thanksgiving is a holiday that involves eating a lot of food.

410
00:31:28,742 --> 00:31:29,708
Speaker 1: That's a great holiday.

411
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:38,518
Speaker 0: see before college We celebrated a shit ton of holidays because it was a Jew and Jews have a shit ton of holidays Just so we can get out of doing other stuff.

412
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:40,165
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, we I mean we weren't.

413
00:31:40,506 --> 00:31:43,015
Speaker 1: my family was very much not very Christian.

414
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:47,237
Speaker 0: if they really weren't Christian You aren't really Jewish except for celebrating holidays.

415
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:56,120
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it was the same thing like we celebrated Easter and Christmas and all those things partly because when I was young I went to a Catholic school, but we didn't celebrate him for religious reasons.

416
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:58,112
Speaker 1: No one said the word Jesus on Easter.

417
00:31:58,153 --> 00:32:00,387
Speaker 1: They said the word Easter Bunny mmm.

418
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:09,113
Speaker 0: Anyway, when I first started going to college, you know, they tried to keep up the holiday action But they pretty much gave up on that pretty quickly.

419
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:22,800
Speaker 0: and now that I'm out of college I mean now there are some holidays where in college I wouldn't go home or anything and now I will go home because home is just an hour and a half away or so But not really any more celebratory in any sort of way.

420
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:25,595
Speaker 1: Well, I celebrate but I celebrate different ways.

421
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:27,283
Speaker 1: like this year Christmas I'm still seeing.

422
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:29,492
Speaker 1: hopefully I'm gonna fly out to Arizona to see my mom.

423
00:32:30,054 --> 00:32:30,316
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

424
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:31,380
Speaker 0: I thought you weren't gonna do that.

425
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:31,804
Speaker 1: I want to.

426
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:33,220
Speaker 1: it's just a matter of getting good airfare.

427
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,307
Speaker 1: If I don't I'm gonna.

428
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:36,339
Speaker 0: shouldn't you have bought the tickets a while ago?

429
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:42,480
Speaker 1: No, because actually deals flying out there on jetblue come up fairly frequently at the last minute.

430
00:32:42,622 --> 00:32:48,037
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Plus the the real plan is because I haven't seen a good deal like even way back when I was looking.

431
00:32:48,077 --> 00:32:49,384
Speaker 1: I never really caught The deal.

432
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:51,299
Speaker 0: you're gonna just have to shell out if you want to go.

433
00:32:52,282 --> 00:33:02,640
Speaker 1: My plan and I've done this before is that instead of going out on the actual holiday when everyone else in the world Including all those people who don't know how to deal with an airport are flying.

434
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:06,110
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go out in January when no one's flying.

435
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:06,772
Speaker 0: How's your plan?

436
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:07,795
Speaker 0: last year and it didn't work?

437
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:09,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the airlines suck.

438
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:11,807
Speaker 0: Whose fault is that?

439
00:33:11,968 --> 00:33:12,712
Speaker 0: the airlines?

440
00:33:12,752 --> 00:33:14,160
Speaker 0: you for taking the shit airline?

441
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,434
Speaker 1: Because I'm not gonna pay I don't care how much I want to do something.

442
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:20,739
Speaker 1: if it costs more than $300 to fly somewhere I pretty much won't go.

443
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:22,464
Speaker 0: You're stuck in the u.s.

444
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:23,047
Speaker 0: Forever then.

445
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:28,700
Speaker 1: yeah, well, I mean, I'm maybe I'm special occasion like a holiday Like if I was traveling somewhere for a month, it'd be okay.

446
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,392
Speaker 1: But if I'm flying somewhere for a weekend, maybe a three-day weekend.

447
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:34,037
Speaker 1: I'm not paying more than $300 to fly there.

448
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,645
Speaker 1: I don't care what it is.

449
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that's all right.

450
00:33:37,377 --> 00:33:44,267
Speaker 1: I mean I paid $160 to fly to Raleigh for an amazement and That really really sucked.

451
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:54,418
Speaker 1: I felt so bad about paying that cuz I could have driven there for less And it would have taken less time after all the delays at the airport, but I digress dun dun dun.

452
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:55,039
Speaker 0: I digress.

453
00:33:57,148 --> 00:34:01,974
Speaker 1: gifts gifts So probably my favorite kinds of gifts to get now because I really don't give holiday.

454
00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:04,545
Speaker 1: gifts are gifts for someone I really care about.

455
00:34:04,565 --> 00:34:12,337
Speaker 1: that means something to them or to me or to both of us, you know like a gift that just comes up that's natural and makes sense or a hilarious gifts.

456
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:19,760
Speaker 1: Hilarious gifts are the best you see at the Macross party and it seemed like a lame idea until we all really got into it.

457
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,993
Speaker 1: We're having a secret Santa and being the front row crew.

458
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:31,780
Speaker 1: I'm gonna call it the secret Hanukkah, Harry everyone's putting a lot of Humorous thought into exactly what they are buying for this party.

459
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,275
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean the problem is if you're not giving a gift Specifically to a person you need to get something that could be good for anybody.

460
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:42,130
Speaker 0: and that's kind of hard to do Because what's good for everybody?

461
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:49,790
Speaker 0: Well a book Even a video game a really good one isn't good because they might have it Yeah, or they might not have the system.

462
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:54,954
Speaker 1: now people might say oh a gift certificate That's perhaps the lamest gift you can give someone.

463
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:56,079
Speaker 1: that's worse than cash.

464
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,820
Speaker 0: better Give them money if you're gonna do that because at least then they can choose the store.

465
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,083
Speaker 0: I mean if someone gave me like a Walmart gift certificate, I'd be like, I'm not going to Walmart You just gave me nothing.

466
00:35:04,484 --> 00:35:07,533
Speaker 1: but that's also kind of I mean just even cash is really lame.

467
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,500
Speaker 1: now say they were creative about it.

468
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:14,336
Speaker 1: Say the limit on the Secret Santa was 25 bucks and you give someone $25 worth of pennies.

469
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:17,063
Speaker 0: hilarious exactly.

470
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:19,330
Speaker 0: now see that's what it really is about gifts is.

471
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:28,480
Speaker 0: as a kid gifts are important because they're your Primary means of acquiring goods mostly entertainment goods that you cannot acquire on your own.

472
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate to say it but when I was a little kid Christmas was a spawn point.

473
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:36,526
Speaker 0: Yeah as an adult with money Gifts really hold.

474
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:38,232
Speaker 0: it's not like I need stuff.

475
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:40,560
Speaker 0: if I need something I can get it on my own.

476
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,860
Speaker 0: I don't need someone to give me a gift to give me physical goods because I've got them.

477
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:57,940
Speaker 0: so if you're going to give me a gift the actual giving of the gift has to have some sort of humorous or entertaining or Emotional value of some sorts, you know, like yeah, I could have bought it at the store.

478
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:06,829
Speaker 0: but because you are giving it to me at this moment of in time in this fashion and because of what it is and the method of Delivery we are all happier for it.

479
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,380
Speaker 0: And that is that is what you must execute with an adult gift.

480
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:16,763
Speaker 1: Yeah like I mean Emily gave me her old keyboard a while ago as you heard on the show and I've been playing with it a lot and I Think it's really awesome.

481
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:17,365
Speaker 1: Now.

482
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:24,499
Speaker 1: I own a piano and if I wanted to buy a keyboard I would have gone out and bought one and I didn't really need one to buy it.

483
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:31,405
Speaker 1: But the fact that she gave it to me and that was a thoughtful gift and that I've gotten so much Enjoyment out of it.

484
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:32,590
Speaker 1: That was a good gift.

485
00:36:33,052 --> 00:36:46,032
Speaker 1: or like if someone goes on a vacation and They bring back like a really cool little souvenir and they give it to someone like I bought this in London in a blah and it's shaped like a blah.

486
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,056
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

487
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:48,160
Speaker 1: That's an awesome gift.

488
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:49,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of times it's not.

489
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:52,740
Speaker 1: it depends with the souvenirs because no it has to be a good super.

490
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:59,482
Speaker 0: Yeah Sometimes people go somewhere and they'll come back and they'll be like here's a t-shirt with the name of the place I went to.

491
00:36:59,663 --> 00:37:00,184
Speaker 0: oh, no, no.

492
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:03,898
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking like the the DS eraser that you were given.

493
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:06,317
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, little things like that.

494
00:37:07,022 --> 00:37:10,960
Speaker 1: Like actually I remember when Dan went to Japan way back.

495
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:20,120
Speaker 0: We heard our IT and he came back and he got me just a little Totoro pencil board And I think he actually bought like a whole pile of cheap crap and gave different things to different people.

496
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:22,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, as he didn't actually plan it out.

497
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,372
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was still cuz.

498
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:27,266
Speaker 1: back then I didn't own any anime stuff I didn't have any pencil boards or anything.

499
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:38,455
Speaker 1: and he gave me this little trinket from Japan and I learned at that point that I really like little trinkets from Japan as you can tell if you look at my desk Which has almost as many trinkets from Japan as it does useful things.

500
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:39,699
Speaker 0: man trinkets from Japan.

501
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:45,226
Speaker 0: It's like I really hate getting useless stuff, but god damn you Trinkets in Japan.

502
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:47,380
Speaker 1: It's like give me a loose useless piece of plastic whatever.

503
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:52,315
Speaker 1: But if that useless piece of plastic is of a Japanese animated character, it's awesome.

504
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:53,620
Speaker 0: I don't know what's up with that.

505
00:37:56,344 --> 00:37:58,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no logic behind that one.

506
00:37:58,321 --> 00:37:58,877
Speaker 0: It's not good.

507
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:07,190
Speaker 1: but I think really my my favorite kind of gift-giving is the humorous gift-giving, you know, the Secret Santa the Bachelor party joke gift.

508
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:08,877
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a party joking.

509
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,453
Speaker 1: granted those can also be really lame.

510
00:38:11,493 --> 00:38:18,180
Speaker 1: a lot of people go to like Spencer's and they buy like the over-the-hill toilet paper or the over-the-hill cane.

511
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:20,026
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's the stuff that's.

512
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:26,220
Speaker 0: if it's a generic gift if the gift would work for anyone Then a lot of it is pretty much lost.

513
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:31,040
Speaker 0: It has to be like a specific and personal thing for anything to come of it.

514
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:35,031
Speaker 0: You know, it's like you got to buy something like ah, there's something about that.

515
00:38:35,092 --> 00:38:35,874
Speaker 0: that makes it funny.

516
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:47,299
Speaker 0: Like if I bought a Pokemon doll and just gave it to you not funny, but if I bought you ten Pokemon Holding each other now that is something to it.

517
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,515
Speaker 1: That's that's probably the perfect example exactly or like in our group.

518
00:38:51,877 --> 00:38:52,660
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna do this.

519
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,800
Speaker 1: This isn't my Secret Santa gift, but I talked it up and I actually kind of got the benefit by talking this gift up.

520
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:04,461
Speaker 1: I effectively got to give two gifts because the comedic value of the gifts is far greater than the monetary value Mm-hmm.

521
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:08,883
Speaker 1: So my real gift I have and is ready to go the gift I talked about.

522
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:12,035
Speaker 1: see we have an inside joke in the crew about hobo wine.

523
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:13,841
Speaker 1: I think we've talked about it before Mm-hmm.

524
00:39:14,262 --> 00:39:22,079
Speaker 1: after yuko bought us some $2 MD 2020 that we all sampled and it was quite Ode hobo.

525
00:39:23,163 --> 00:39:25,229
Speaker 1: It was really not good.

526
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:25,911
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was.

527
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:27,455
Speaker 0: I feel like drinking some right now.

528
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:28,017
Speaker 0: Just kidding.

529
00:39:28,217 --> 00:39:30,023
Speaker 1: We've got it still Do we really?

530
00:39:30,164 --> 00:39:31,269
Speaker 0: Yes, it's still good.

531
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:32,735
Speaker 1: I don't think it goes bad.

532
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:34,000
Speaker 0: Why has to go bad?

533
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:34,642
Speaker 1: I don't know.

534
00:39:34,702 --> 00:39:36,368
Speaker 1: might not refrigerated alcohol.

535
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:37,572
Speaker 0: We'll check it.

536
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:39,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know how we'll tell.

537
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:42,006
Speaker 1: Give it to a hobo.

538
00:39:42,408 --> 00:39:43,392
Speaker 1: I know some hope but let's just.

539
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:44,317
Speaker 1: I got it.

540
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:44,819
Speaker 1: I got it.

541
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:50,080
Speaker 1: Let's just leave it on the street corner because those hobos walk by all the time.

542
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:52,225
Speaker 1: Let's see if someone takes it.

543
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:55,015
Speaker 0: We'll watch it where the camera some weekend.

544
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:56,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll just keep an eye on it.

545
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,232
Speaker 0: Let's go get a camera.

546
00:39:57,515 --> 00:40:02,916
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah That's the only thing of monetary value other than a Ferrari in a house that I don't have.

547
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:06,960
Speaker 0: and a new computer that I don't Have is a nice video camera because I have no clue.

548
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,538
Speaker 0: It's not that I can't afford one It's I have no clue what to get.

549
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,040
Speaker 1: But the hobo wine thing became kind of an inside joke for the crew.

550
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:23,613
Speaker 1: so I thought my secret Santa gift would be a ratty flannel shirt tied to the end of a stick like a bindle and Inside of it would be $20 worth of hobo wine.

551
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:25,580
Speaker 0: It's a lot of fucking hobo wine.

552
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, you couldn't lift that in the flannel shirt.

553
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,853
Speaker 1: I could lift it.

554
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:30,640
Speaker 0: I don't know the stick would break.

555
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:32,507
Speaker 0: You need a big seemed like a 2x4.

556
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,112
Speaker 1: I got I had the stick ready.

557
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:35,096
Speaker 0: Did you really?

558
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:40,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, wow that stick I was I was playing with on the back deck that big thick thing That could do it.

559
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,180
Speaker 0: That would be kind of crazy though.

560
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:46,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, but see the idea of that joke is really funny, especially to someone in the crew.

561
00:40:46,602 --> 00:40:51,620
Speaker 1: So I already got all the benefit of actually getting that gift without having to do anything exactly.

562
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,594
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, you don't actually need to give physical goods.

563
00:40:55,614 --> 00:40:57,140
Speaker 0: That's not what it's about anymore.

564
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:03,996
Speaker 1: You know, it sounds stupid But it's the thought that counts is probably the biggest axiom of gift-giving in the world.

565
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:06,203
Speaker 0: unless you're a little kid in which case Goddamn it.

566
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:08,391
Speaker 0: You need some fucking video games and not underwear.

567
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:09,194
Speaker 1: Yes socks.

568
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:10,599
Speaker 1: Press a. what the hell is this?

569
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:22,704
Speaker 0: And I think that's the problem is you know Until kids until there's no more child labor laws and kids can go work and make their own money and buy their own games You we need to give them.

570
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:28,460
Speaker 0: goddamn gifts and if a kid already has everything well your kid doesn't need me more stop giving them.

571
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:39,272
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean the the the sentiment behind a gift or the thought behind a gift and I guess now that we're adults matters A hell of a lot more than what the gift is.

572
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:43,311
Speaker 1: and as a result Instead of giving gifts we seem to have much more fun.

573
00:41:43,351 --> 00:41:46,082
Speaker 1: Just getting together with our friends Mm-hmm.

574
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:50,095
Speaker 0: I mean if we could all just think of hilarious gifts and tell them to each other.

575
00:41:50,115 --> 00:41:51,600
Speaker 0: That would be just as good.

576
00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:54,869
Speaker 1: Yeah So we're having this holiday party and pretty much no one's.

577
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,093
Speaker 1: not many people are given.

578
00:41:56,153 --> 00:42:00,600
Speaker 1: other people like I got this gift for you I got this gift for you and I got this gift for you.

579
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,082
Speaker 1: It's just.

580
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:04,399
Speaker 1: we're all gonna present our hilarious gifts to the group.

581
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:08,779
Speaker 1: Disseminate them however, we will and then play guitar heroes too while we're drunk.

582
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:11,622
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Sounds good.

583
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:13,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, you won't be drinking though.

584
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:13,710
Speaker 0: Nope.

585
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:16,120
Speaker 1: Ah, what if I get some grog?

586
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,366
Speaker 1: Some my hobo wine.

587
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:18,969
Speaker 0: It's all right.

588
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:20,035
Speaker 1: You tried the hobo wine.

589
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:24,791
Speaker 1: It was bad Real bad, I've drank worse things.

590
00:42:24,851 --> 00:42:29,289
Speaker 0: I should go buy some grape juice In the bend the glass bottle and drink that.

591
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:33,664
Speaker 1: I got some sparkling apple juice for the people who don't want to drink champagne But it's sparkling.

592
00:42:34,225 --> 00:42:35,690
Speaker 1: That's the point of champagne.

593
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,074
Speaker 0: I don't like sparkling.

594
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,098
Speaker 1: Why not?

595
00:42:38,218 --> 00:42:38,800
Speaker 0: it fizzes.

596
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,206
Speaker 1: And what's wrong with fizz?

597
00:42:40,346 --> 00:42:41,552
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's wrong with it.

598
00:42:41,753 --> 00:42:43,339
Speaker 1: I'd like you to say it out loud on the air.

599
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:46,812
Speaker 0: That's what I was just trying to make sure that people understood that.

600
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:47,917
Speaker 0: that that you already knew.

601
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:51,792
Speaker 0: Yeah I already know is a it is not comfortable.

602
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:53,920
Speaker 1: So what do you mean by not comfortable?

603
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,995
Speaker 1: You're saying that fizzy beverages beverages that are carbonated in some way harm you.

604
00:42:58,437 --> 00:42:59,080
Speaker 0: they do indeed.

605
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:12,280
Speaker 1: so you're saying that you feel physical pain when a carbonated beverage is placed into your mouth a Carbonated beverage that the vast majority of Americans drink on a daily basis and love.

606
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:14,311
Speaker 0: Many do yes.

607
00:43:14,573 --> 00:43:23,073
Speaker 1: Yes And this causes you physical pain in a very small way But enough of a pain to where you refuse to drink any such thing.

608
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:24,499
Speaker 0: I'd like to avoid it.

609
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:27,353
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to get that out there.

610
00:43:27,614 --> 00:43:27,775
Speaker 1: Yeah.

611
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:28,358
Speaker 1: Yeah.

612
00:43:29,821 --> 00:43:34,857
Speaker 1: So I guess in closing you can look ten gift horses in the mouth, but you can't fool them twice.

613
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:35,880
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

614
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:39,668
Speaker 0: Are there two birds in the bush or three?

615
00:43:39,688 --> 00:43:42,297
Speaker 1: I don't know but I killed more than one of them with a stone.
