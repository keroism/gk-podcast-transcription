1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,309
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, May 26th 2015.

2
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:12,810
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:13,512
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:17,440
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, Heroes of the Storm.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,647
Speaker 1: Storm.

6
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:20,611
Speaker 0: Storm.

7
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:22,940
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,214
Speaker 1: It was a holiday weekend.

9
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:28,800
Speaker 1: It's finally basically summer.

10
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:31,930
Speaker 1: And I went for a run a couple days ago.

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,517
Speaker 1: Well basically over the weekend I ran a split marathon.

12
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:35,420
Speaker 1: I've never done that before.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,423
Speaker 1: So I've ran two 15 mile runs basically.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,854
Speaker 0: So a marathon is 30 miles?

15
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:41,440
Speaker 1: A marathon is like 26 miles.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,550
Speaker 1: so I ran about a half a marathon, a little more.

17
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,776
Speaker 1: And then I ran about a half marathon again, a little more.

18
00:00:47,358 --> 00:00:50,690
Speaker 1: So average out, it's a marathon but over a couple days.

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,260
Speaker 0: Pretty sure that's a bad time, a couple days for a marathon.

20
00:00:55,662 --> 00:00:58,150
Speaker 0: I mean even the old people who run in the marathon don't take a couple days.

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,995
Speaker 0: They finish it on the one day usually.

22
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,222
Speaker 1: I've always said for years that I run.

23
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:03,085
Speaker 1: I run a lot.

24
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,489
Speaker 1: That's just one of the sports I do.

25
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:06,736
Speaker 1: And I run in races and everything.

26
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:11,630
Speaker 1: But I always said I'd never run a marathon because they're fucking horrible for your body.

27
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:13,874
Speaker 1: So I run half marathons.

28
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:19,990
Speaker 1: But when I started my second half marathon in a couple days, I started running.

29
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,321
Speaker 1: I hit like the 13 mile mark which is like the half marathon.

30
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:27,209
Speaker 1: And my body said I could just keep doing this.

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,360
Speaker 1: And I started to think maybe I should just do a marathon just to say I did it.

32
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,590
Speaker 1: And I feel like I'm not gonna actually do that because I still think they're horrible for your body.

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,130
Speaker 0: Why don't you just enter the New York City marathon and then as soon as you feel shitty, just stop and walk off.

34
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,322
Speaker 0: Not like some of the people who try to win it.

35
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:43,450
Speaker 0: Get on the subway and go home.

36
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,030
Speaker 1: Not the people I've seen who literally poop themselves while running.

37
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,338
Speaker 0: You have no chance of winning.

38
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,190
Speaker 0: So as soon as it's uncomfortable, just stop.

39
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,052
Speaker 1: No chance of winning.

40
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:52,358
Speaker 1: I have no chance of winning a 5k race.

41
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,510
Speaker 1: When I enter a 5k race, I'll get a time of like 19-20 minutes which is really good.

42
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,226
Speaker 1: But then some asshole gets like 13 minutes.

43
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a professional person.

44
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:05,406
Speaker 1: My best time on a 10k ever is like 52 minutes.

45
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:10,348
Speaker 0: So I made the wise decision of not going to work.

46
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:11,671
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

47
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:19,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right because I saw you tweeted a picture of you today while I was sitting in my office eating like a sandwich.

48
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,110
Speaker 1: And I see you're out and out and flushing it like Corona Park.

49
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:23,952
Speaker 0: That's right.

50
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:27,569
Speaker 0: Everyone else, I have an idea.

51
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,245
Speaker 1: Quit your job and bike around.

52
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,840
Speaker 0: Everybody's gotta have to, you know, everyone's life.

53
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:35,950
Speaker 0: You know, you think about your life, right?

54
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,160
Speaker 0: You don't like going to work.

55
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:38,130
Speaker 0: Going to work sucks.

56
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,409
Speaker 1: There's a few people who like going to work, but not many.

57
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,073
Speaker 0: Alright, fuck them.

58
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:43,810
Speaker 0: No one here wants to go to work, right?

59
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:49,769
Speaker 0: Scott, what if your life- Wouldn't you much rather just go to the park and bike around every day, eat ice cream, have a good time.

60
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,608
Speaker 1: Well you guys all forget- Play some vidya games.

61
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:54,627
Speaker 0: That one day- Do your laundry.

62
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:07,610
Speaker 1: When I quit my job at Dibella's when I was working at RIT, one morning I remember my alarm went off and I laid there in bed and it was super nice outside and the sun is like coming in through the window on my body.

63
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:14,110
Speaker 1: And I heard my alarm and I turned it off and I consciously decided to fall back asleep in that sunbeam.

64
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:23,129
Speaker 1: And then like an hour later, the phone rings, I reach over and I pick it up and it's my boss from Dibella saying, "Hey, where are

65
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:23,309
Speaker 1: you?".

66
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,653
Speaker 1: I'm like, "I didn't come in

67
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:25,034
Speaker 1: today."

68
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:30,309
Speaker 1: And there's a long pause and then he just says, "Are you ever going to come in

69
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:30,549
Speaker 1: again?".

70
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,696
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Long pause?

71
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:35,080
Speaker 1: Nah.".

72
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:38,410
Speaker 1: And I hung up and that was one of the best days of my life.

73
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,610
Speaker 0: So, why don't we just all do that all together at the same time?

74
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:48,418
Speaker 0: I think it's called a general strike, but it's like we don't have to be protesting anything.

75
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:53,290
Speaker 0: Let's just fucking, no one go to work anymore and we'll all have a good time.

76
00:03:53,450 --> 00:04:08,690
Speaker 1: If all the nerds and geeks just stop going to work at the same time, parts of society would keep functioning, but the parts that matter would slowly stop to function and they'd need us back and maybe we'd get some concessions.

77
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,698
Speaker 0: The concession like, "I'll work one hour a week.

78
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:15,943
Speaker 0: You pay for my apartment, I'll work one hour a week.

79
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,750
Speaker 0: You feed me, I'll work one hour a

80
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:18,850
Speaker 0: week.".

81
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:29,464
Speaker 1: If someone agreed that I had to give them 10 hours of work a week, but they were a fully 100% dedicated 10 hours, I would do that for my current salary.

82
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:32,548
Speaker 1: I wouldn't feel that bad about it.

83
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:35,030
Speaker 1: But then I'd be pushing for 8.

84
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:43,630
Speaker 0: But it's like, I'm not working the rest of this week because I had to use my vacation days before they reset July 1st, so of course I used them on the 4-day week to just get maximum power leverage.

85
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,517
Speaker 0: Seriously, I really do not want to work.

86
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,059
Speaker 0: I gotta do something.

87
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,310
Speaker 1: If any of you listeners out there, because we're looking at doing some things like a Patreon to go to Australia.

88
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,021
Speaker 0: I might just take all my money, even my 401k money, and pay the taxes.

89
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:03,645
Speaker 0: The taxes can't be that much.

90
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:04,306
Speaker 0: What is it, half?

91
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:05,750
Speaker 1: How much is it?

92
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:09,170
Speaker 1: I looked into it once to borrow against it to buy that house.

93
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,573
Speaker 0: No, I don't want to borrow against it.

94
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:19,050
Speaker 0: I just want to take it, pay the taxes on it, and then go somewhere where it doesn't cost anything to live and just not have to work for years.

95
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,490
Speaker 1: Why don't you go one step further and max out all your credit cards for cash and get the biggest personal loan you can.

96
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, that's a problem because then people would come after me.

97
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,143
Speaker 1: I thought you were going to go somewhere that's cheap to live.

98
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:33,089
Speaker 1: That means not in the US.

99
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,788
Speaker 0: But I still have to pay back the loan somehow.

100
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,078
Speaker 1: No, just leave.

101
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:37,369
Speaker 1: That's the whole plan.

102
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:38,449
Speaker 0: That doesn't work.

103
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:49,810
Speaker 1: If you're going to just say "fuck it" and empty all your accounts, you might as well empty the account that every American above a certain income level has, which is called "fairly unlimited credit" with little oversight.

104
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,250
Speaker 0: But if I go to another country, won't they still come after me?

105
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,335
Speaker 1: Depends on what country.

106
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,890
Speaker 1: If you're in Bolivia or Venezuela, no one's going to come after you.

107
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,989
Speaker 0: Well, I don't want to go there.

108
00:05:57,492 --> 00:05:58,102
Speaker 1: Where do you want to go?

109
00:05:58,951 --> 00:05:59,293
Speaker 0: I don't know.

110
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:01,305
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously I want to go to New York City.

111
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:01,990
Speaker 0: That's a good place.

112
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's the problem.

113
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,210
Speaker 1: To live in New York, you've got to work in New York.

114
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,750
Speaker 0: But I mean, I could live in just the sticks in the United States in a trailer with the internet.

115
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:18,504
Speaker 1: You know, you say that, and it may be true, I don't know, but Beacon felt like the sticks.

116
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,870
Speaker 1: And Beacon is so far from the sticks.

117
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,950
Speaker 0: It just needs to be a place that has a grocery store.

118
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,769
Speaker 1: Scott, have you ever lived in the sticks?

119
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,409
Speaker 0: I went to summer camp, which is even more stick, because you don't even go into society.

120
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,629
Speaker 0: But you're at a camp.

121
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,409
Speaker 0: You just stay in the camp the whole time.

122
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:33,680
Speaker 0: Yeah.

123
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,950
Speaker 0: Why don't I just go to a camp?

124
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:39,110
Speaker 1: Just be that creepy hobo who lives at the camp?

125
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:41,224
Speaker 0: No, I'd like own a camp or something.

126
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:41,546
Speaker 0: I don't know.

127
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:44,713
Speaker 0: Well, like I was saying- Camp directors don't have to do anything.

128
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:49,890
Speaker 0: Just get to enjoy summer camp, and then, you know, in the not-summer, they just don't do anything.

129
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,034
Speaker 1: We like making content.

130
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:52,277
Speaker 1: It's kind of a hobby.

131
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:59,190
Speaker 1: So if any venture capitalists out there want to give us a pile of money to make a lot more content- I will take your pile of money and go to the beach, and you won't see me again.

132
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:03,527
Speaker 1: We'll make a lot of content, but it'll be a lot of like, "Here's a time lapse of us at the beach this

133
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:03,748
Speaker 1: week.".

134
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,410
Speaker 0: Here is me swimming.

135
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:07,777
Speaker 1: You know what we'll give you?

136
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:09,690
Speaker 1: We'll record all of our conversations.

137
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,059
Speaker 0: I have so much free time now.

138
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,965
Speaker 0: I tried fishing.

139
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:12,750
Speaker 0: Here's a fishy fish.

140
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:13,485
Speaker 0: Yeah.

141
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:15,690
Speaker 0: I tossed him back because he's a fishy fish.

142
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,872
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what.

143
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:17,976
Speaker 1: You know what else we'll do?

144
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:21,407
Speaker 1: We'll even finish Radio Free Equestria and Utena.

145
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:22,330
Speaker 1: Sure.

146
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:23,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

147
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,492
Speaker 1: I could do that.

148
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:26,188
Speaker 1: That would only take like a month if we were working on it full-time.

149
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:26,530
Speaker 1: Tops.

150
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:28,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

151
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:30,969
Speaker 0: Seriously though, I got to not work.

152
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, believe me.

153
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:34,790
Speaker 1: Because I'm pitching some stuff internally.

154
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,429
Speaker 0: If I don't show up, how long do you think until they stop paying me?

155
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,344
Speaker 1: My company financed a lot quicker probably.

156
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:43,370
Speaker 1: I mean, my old company.

157
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,669
Speaker 0: Like if I just didn't show up next Monday when I'm supposed to go back, and they call me like, "Where are

158
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:48,790
Speaker 0: you?"

159
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,960
Speaker 0: I'd be like, "I got used to not working.

160
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,729
Speaker 0: I don't know if I can come

161
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:52,870
Speaker 0: back.".

162
00:07:52,870 --> 00:08:00,030
Speaker 1: Well, when I was working at that hospital, I'm pretty sure if I just stopped showing up, it would have been at least six months before anyone caught on and stopped paying me.

163
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,110
Speaker 0: Why did you not do that?

164
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:06,830
Speaker 1: What I did is I went into work, and I actually did go around and be like, "Yo, do you have any work for me?

165
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,916
Speaker 1: Do you have any projects?

166
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:08,420
Speaker 1: Anything?".

167
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,829
Speaker 1: To everyone who I reported to.

168
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,990
Speaker 0: I mean, I have some work to do, but it's like I don't work on it as intensely as I could.

169
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,369
Speaker 0: I could probably just get everything done if I actually worked.

170
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:26,369
Speaker 0: But it's like I basically work slowly or intermittently, and I get everything done that they need done on time.

171
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,739
Speaker 0: And the other things I just let sit.

172
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,342
Speaker 0: I don't care.

173
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:38,230
Speaker 1: At my current job, anything I want to do is just crippled by momentum, bureaucracy, and just like what resources are available.

174
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's plenty of that too.

175
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:43,405
Speaker 0: I just don't want to sit in an office while the sun is out pretty much.

176
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:44,590
Speaker 0: I don't care what I'm doing.

177
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:47,789
Speaker 0: Even if I was working and being productive the whole time, it's like I don't want to do that.

178
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:53,290
Speaker 1: So we could turtle for a year and try to make one of those things we've been talking about.

179
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,495
Speaker 0: All right, sure.

180
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:55,904
Speaker 0: How are we going to eat?

181
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:56,790
Speaker 0: Turtles need food.

182
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,990
Speaker 1: We both empty our accounts, and then we've got it most a year living in New York.

183
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:01,708
Speaker 0: I don't have a year.

184
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:02,833
Speaker 1: I have a year.

185
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:04,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have a year.

186
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:05,810
Speaker 1: I have a year easily.

187
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,348
Speaker 0: The problem is if I empty those accounts, I got to pay taxes on it.

188
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,092
Speaker 1: Wait, no.

189
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:09,736
Speaker 1: A year is $45,000 in rent.

190
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:10,158
Speaker 1: Jesus.

191
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,301
Speaker 1: I almost have a year.

192
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,147
Speaker 0: I do not.

193
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:17,315
Speaker 1: I could do a year.

194
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:19,629
Speaker 1: The problem is at the end of that year.

195
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:24,988
Speaker 0: You got to remember, you got to pay to go to PAX and all this other stuff too.

196
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:25,570
Speaker 0: Those are rents.

197
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:28,070
Speaker 0: Every time you go to PAX, you're basically paying another month of rent.

198
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:28,902
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

199
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,680
Speaker 0: So that's four months a year where your rent is double.

200
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,750
Speaker 0: If you go to Australia, that month is triple rent.

201
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,610
Speaker 0: Because you got to pay rent in your apartment while you're in Australia.

202
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,330
Speaker 0: Well, I did calculate once that- The plane ticket is equal to the rent cost.

203
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:48,157
Speaker 1: If you, me, and Emily move back to Beacon and quit our jobs and just put our money into a big account to pay for it and lived our current lifestyle.

204
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:51,210
Speaker 1: but in Beacon, we have at least three years.

205
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:53,409
Speaker 0: It's not good.

206
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,583
Speaker 1: Of course, actually now Beacon's getting kind of expensive.

207
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:56,450
Speaker 1: We might have to go further up.

208
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:57,948
Speaker 0: Whatever.

209
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,710
Speaker 1: Anyway, so in the news bits, I played a game.

210
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,590
Speaker 1: I want to give a review of it because some people might get dragged into one of these things.

211
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,589
Speaker 1: You know, that kind of thing happens.

212
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:07,674
Speaker 1: I got dragged into it.

213
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:11,067
Speaker 1: Emily's company was a thing they were doing as a party and she was like, "Oh, you want to

214
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:11,228
Speaker 1: come?".

215
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:11,650
Speaker 1: So I came.

216
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:19,410
Speaker 1: And what I want to say, and I don't want to spoil it because talking too much about this game is like talking too much about Layton.

217
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,930
Speaker 1: If I just tell you the answers to ten of the puzzles, that kind of just ruins parts of Layton.

218
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:31,190
Speaker 1: Puzzle games are one of the kinds of games that can be straight up spoiled because telling someone the answer literally removes the reason to play that part of the game.

219
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,612
Speaker 0: I don't know.

220
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,270
Speaker 0: People like to buy a crossword puzzle book and look in the back.

221
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:36,230
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, because those people are stupid.

222
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,704
Speaker 1: There are people, I'm sure, who play Layton games by reading a fact.

223
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,990
Speaker 1: I'm sure that happens.

224
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,450
Speaker 0: I bet there's a Layton fact on Game Pass.

225
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,170
Speaker 0: Sometimes you need one because the puzzles are worded so poorly in the translation.

226
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:56,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's a difference between the thing we did that one time that we swore we'd never reveal ever to anyone who wasn't in the room.

227
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:57,649
Speaker 0: I don't remember what that was.

228
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,568
Speaker 1: You remember what that was?

229
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:10,970
Speaker 1: We looked up a thing through a system to see if something was on the right track or not because we didn't trust the game designer during a marathon run of something.

230
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:13,810
Speaker 0: I barely remember.

231
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:15,015
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.

232
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:16,201
Speaker 1: I guess it's good.

233
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,070
Speaker 1: I guess we can trust you to keep secrets.

234
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:19,544
Speaker 0: My memories...

235
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,210
Speaker 1: Only two other people know about this, Scott, in the whole world.

236
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:24,078
Speaker 0: I use computers.

237
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:25,309
Speaker 0: I don't use my brains.

238
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:29,209
Speaker 1: I've maintained my internal memory to a higher degree, I think.

239
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,923
Speaker 1: Okay, after the show, I'll tell you.

240
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:32,610
Speaker 1: I can't tell you on the show.

241
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:39,170
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I did one of those "Escape the Room" games with Emily and a bunch of her co-workers at What Pumpkin.

242
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:42,243
Speaker 1: And it was literally...

243
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,710
Speaker 0: I mean, there's been video game versions of this for a long time, and I knew that in the city there were a couple physical versions.

244
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,850
Speaker 1: Yep, and there's a bunch of different ones.

245
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,250
Speaker 0: They put you in a room and you have to escape.

246
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,290
Speaker 0: Basically, you play Myst, but it's actually physical.

247
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,970
Speaker 1: So the deal is, you go in, you have like ten people or whatever.

248
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,290
Speaker 0: Is there like a desk with junk in it and writing on the wall?

249
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, but... Is there like UV light reveal text that's in different places?

250
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:09,409
Speaker 0: And keys that open shit?

251
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:10,729
Speaker 1: You will come up with everything.

252
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:11,545
Speaker 0: Combination locks?

253
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,830
Speaker 1: You'll come up with every kind of thing they would do.

254
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,930
Speaker 1: But what surprised me was the sheer high production values.

255
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, really, the production value was actually high.

256
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:27,830
Speaker 1: Here's an example of a puzzle, and I'm not going to give a lot of examples because I don't want to spoil stuff because it was actually super fun.

257
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:36,070
Speaker 1: So at one point, we bust open this desk and we find a bunch of photos, like old black and white, old timey photos, of the rooms we're in.

258
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:37,268
Speaker 1: Just like a bunch of photos of it.

259
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:44,365
Speaker 1: So we figure it out, we look at the photo, and we see... Like we're looking at the photo...

260
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,848
Speaker 0: The photo is different from the room you're in.

261
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's this big...

262
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,589
Speaker 1: There's an object that's in a different spot.

263
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:58,090
Speaker 1: So we move it to the different spot, and magnets and stuff triggered shit that happened and moved in the room when we did that.

264
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,270
Speaker 1: Like, it's actually automated.

265
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,705
Speaker 1: It's not like a human watching a camera and hitting a button like, "Oh, they figured out a thing.

266
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:06,110
Speaker 1: I'll open that door," or whatever.

267
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,710
Speaker 1: It's like, you futz with the thing and you make the thing happen, and then a secret panel literally just opens.

268
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,269
Speaker 0: Did they search you before you went in there?

269
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:13,562
Speaker 0: No.

270
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:16,729
Speaker 0: So I bring in my multi-tool and here we go.

271
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,272
Speaker 1: You know what?

272
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:17,716
Speaker 1: Good luck.

273
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:19,189
Speaker 1: That wouldn't work on a lot of these things.

274
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,930
Speaker 0: But it's like you can jimmy open stuff that was supposed to be locked and... You basically bypass puzzles, right?

275
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:26,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they were very good.

276
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:31,050
Speaker 1: So one thing that they did that was also clever is they gave you a few constraints.

277
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,810
Speaker 1: There were like, one, you don't have to physically break anything.

278
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:42,230
Speaker 1: Two, anything above the extent of your hand up is not part of the puzzle.

279
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:43,570
Speaker 1: Don't climb onto the ceiling.

280
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,189
Speaker 0: But what if I want to physically break something?

281
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:48,298
Speaker 1: Don't.

282
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,381
Speaker 0: But I want to.

283
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:56,129
Speaker 1: Well, then that's like, all right, you're at PAX and you're just like, "I want to smash this board game in

284
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:56,310
Speaker 1: tabletop.".

285
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,529
Speaker 0: I don't want to figure out how to unlock this desk.

286
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,550
Speaker 0: I want to take this heavy thing over here and break it open.

287
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,534
Speaker 1: Well, what did I just say?

288
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:03,580
Speaker 1: Don't break shit.

289
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:05,370
Speaker 1: Nothing needs breaking to solve.

290
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,390
Speaker 0: You don't need to, but it helps it go faster.

291
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:08,652
Speaker 0: No.

292
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:13,930
Speaker 0: It's like, yes, you could beat this video game without killing anyone and just do it all stealth, but why?

293
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,009
Speaker 0: Just kill people.

294
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,570
Speaker 1: But I guess what really got me was that... Virtual people.

295
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,130
Speaker 1: We had a bunch of people who were pretty smart people and we were walking around doing our thing.

296
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,250
Speaker 1: And it was interesting watching the socialization of people splitting into a couple of groups.

297
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:28,030
Speaker 1: And then a few leaders sort of emerged.

298
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:37,288
Speaker 1: Like, someone would come back, like Emily Kidbump was just like, "Hey, I found three of this kind of thing, so is there anyone else who needs three things for a

299
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:37,649
Speaker 1: puzzle?".

300
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,669
Speaker 0: Could you use your phones to take pictures of stuff?

301
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:41,990
Speaker 0: You could.

302
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,250
Speaker 0: Did they let you bring your phone in there?

303
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:43,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, they didn't care.

304
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,434
Speaker 1: But they were very clear.

305
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:49,770
Speaker 1: You did not need to ever use any external resource to figure it out.

306
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,814
Speaker 0: Need to, again.

307
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:54,070
Speaker 0: You could facilitate and greatly expedite your victory.

308
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,988
Speaker 0: Not really.

309
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,530
Speaker 1: Like, the only thing you could have done with the phone is if you didn't know... Like, in one example, say you didn't know Morse code.

310
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,999
Speaker 1: And you didn't find the thing to teach you Morse code.

311
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,230
Speaker 1: in the puzzle, you could look up Morse code, I guess.

312
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:11,870
Speaker 1: But you probably found the thing that taught you Morse code before you found the Morse code.

313
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:23,369
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously putting the Morse code hint in there, but it's like, if I happen to have found the Morse code before finding the Morse code thing, my first instinct would just be to Google it.

314
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,150
Speaker 1: But that's cool, because that works out, because the puzzles were really parallel.

315
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:30,089
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of different directions to go.

316
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,450
Speaker 0: So that's a design meant for the fact that you bet a whole bunch of people in there at once, as opposed to one at a time.

317
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:45,650
Speaker 1: And there's a good amount of, like, clever things that are either red herrings, or that someone who's smart but a little too clever is going to go down the wrong fucking road and look like a moron.

318
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,090
Speaker 0: Oh, but like, is there any ending other than you escape, or is there multiple endings?

319
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:58,030
Speaker 1: Yes, so the way it starts, for most of them, but they're not all like this, is they lock the door, and there's a mechanism to unlock the door.

320
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,586
Speaker 1: You have 60 minutes to get out, or you lose.

321
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:02,330
Speaker 1: It's a game.

322
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,729
Speaker 0: But the only endings are win and lose.

323
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:13,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I suspect, because the one we did was apparently, like, they keep upping the production values and adding more and more, like, story elements and stuff.

324
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,789
Speaker 0: Because no one will ever come back.

325
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,860
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, it's like the bouldering gym we go to.

326
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,550
Speaker 1: Like, no one would go to a rock climbing gym that never changes the crowd.

327
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,990
Speaker 0: You gotta make the roller coasters taller.

328
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,384
Speaker 1: So, like our gym.

329
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:25,008
Speaker 0: Someone's gonna get one that's like a whole house.

330
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:25,638
Speaker 1: Yeah.

331
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,430
Speaker 0: Maniac mansion for reals.

332
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,589
Speaker 1: So there was a point, we're in this pretty big fucking room, and we're like doing all this stuff, and like, it's pretty cool, it's pretty cool.

333
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:39,509
Speaker 1: And then someone, like, does a thing, and then a bookcase just goes like, and there's a whole other room back there.

334
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,086
Speaker 0: There you go.

335
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,690
Speaker 1: One of them looks like there's no lights, you just have some flashlights.

336
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:45,809
Speaker 1: Like, it's all cool stuff.

337
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:55,630
Speaker 1: So if you ever wanted to do Professor Layton in person, physically, with a few friends, these things are way better than I expected it to be.

338
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,510
Speaker 1: Like, I was, I went into this to be perfectly blunt.

339
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:08,030
Speaker 1: I wasn't like, oh, this is gonna suck, but while I was smiling on the inside, I was expecting a really sad experience.

340
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,789
Speaker 0: If I set one of those up, if I ran one of those, what I would do?

341
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,029
Speaker 1: Knives on springs.

342
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,289
Speaker 0: The way it would work is you would come with a group, and it would always be, well, we had to combine two groups.

343
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:18,729
Speaker 1: And the other group is all stooges.

344
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,230
Speaker 0: Obviously, the other group is all actors.

345
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,549
Speaker 0: And we pretty much just do shit like kidnap members of your group into a secret room.

346
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:29,669
Speaker 0: And you're like, where did Rim go?

347
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:32,149
Speaker 1: Oh my god, where did Rim go?

348
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,829
Speaker 1: He's not in this locked room.

349
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:36,350
Speaker 0: And I'm looking all over it.

350
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,490
Speaker 0: I can see everything.

351
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,869
Speaker 0: And I do not see him, and I do not hear him.

352
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:41,088
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

353
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:43,130
Speaker 1: I feel like you could do really clever things.

354
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:49,330
Speaker 1: Like, you could have versus ones, where there's two groups and two sets of rooms, but they interact, and only one group is going to get out.

355
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,348
Speaker 0: Here's a better idea.

356
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,690
Speaker 0: You're two groups and two sets of rooms, one group, your goal is not to get out.

357
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:58,690
Speaker 1: But to prevent the other group from getting out, or to kill the other group.

358
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,989
Speaker 0: Yes, to release the poison gas into the other group's room.

359
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:08,490
Speaker 1: But these things are really cool, and AR/VR tech is just not really there yet.

360
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,970
Speaker 1: AR also just means augmented spaces.

361
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,070
Speaker 0: How much did they charge you for this nonsense?

362
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:16,389
Speaker 1: Not that much money.

363
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:16,698
Speaker 0: Really?

364
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:18,228
Speaker 0: For an hour?

365
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was way cheaper than a play.

366
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:22,449
Speaker 0: How much was it?

367
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:23,247
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

368
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,030
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

369
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,570
Speaker 1: But tens of dollars, not hundreds.

370
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,530
Speaker 0: Per person or total?

371
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,188
Speaker 1: I think it's per person.

372
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,070
Speaker 0: Okay.

373
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,188
Speaker 1: Like 10 or 20 bucks, I think.

374
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:30,989
Speaker 0: So it was a lot.

375
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:31,990
Speaker 0: 20 bucks per person.

376
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,909
Speaker 0: How many people were in there?

377
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got, how much does it cost?

378
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,469
Speaker 1: We had, I think, eight people?

379
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:38,814
Speaker 0: 20 times eight, 160.

380
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:39,932
Speaker 1: It was 160.

381
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:42,130
Speaker 1: It was 190 a ticket, just to see Macbeth.

382
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's one hockey ticket.

383
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:49,890
Speaker 1: But seriously, this was way better than I expected, to a degree that was kind of surprising.

384
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,730
Speaker 1: And if you're around New York, I kind of recommend checking this out.

385
00:18:54,192 --> 00:19:02,990
Speaker 0: So the production value is high, but it's still nothing that I don't imagine it to be, so there's still no reason- No, but it's the good version of what you could imagine.

386
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,790
Speaker 1: It's not the janky version that I imagined.

387
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,249
Speaker 1: And the other thing is, they keep upping the ante, at least these people do.

388
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:10,651
Speaker 1: So I

389
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:13,289
Speaker 0: should wait until I'm an old man and then do it, and it'll be like-

390
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:24,449
Speaker 1: I don't know, I think if we wait a couple of years, these are going to get to the point to where people start doing some clever shit, and I notice that one of the new ones they've got is a horror mystery instead of just a mystery mystery.

391
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:30,429
Speaker 1: I want just like, you open the bookcase and it's just full of blood, just buckets of blood coming out.

392
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,909
Speaker 0: Actually blood gets on you like a guar concert.

393
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:35,510
Speaker 1: Like Luke Burge's idea for the subway.

394
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:39,870
Speaker 1: So you got a game or a news or a game news?

395
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:41,910
Speaker 0: I do, let me open it up here.

396
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,950
Speaker 0: So, oh, I remember exactly what my game news is.

397
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,090
Speaker 0: So, remember when you went to L Japan?

398
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:47,870
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

399
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:51,790
Speaker 0: And they had El Gundam Pod, they had all kinds of miraculous arcade games there that we don't have.

400
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,590
Speaker 1: Oh my god, that Gundam Pod was one of the most transcendent arcade experiences I've ever had.

401
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,390
Speaker 0: Well, if you don't know, they now have Star Wars Pod.

402
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,829
Speaker 0: I think I saw a link to that.

403
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,300
Speaker 0: There is now Star Wars Pod, also- Is it only at Disney?

404
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,049
Speaker 1: Like where is it going to be?

405
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:06,567
Speaker 1: Japan.

406
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:14,350
Speaker 0: So not only, here's the news though, not only do they have Star Wars Pod, they have both pod version and non-pod arcade machines.

407
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,930
Speaker 0: So you can play it as like a, you know, there's two versions of the arcade machine.

408
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,350
Speaker 0: One with the full pod and one that's smaller and less expensive if you're, say, an arcade owner.

409
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,429
Speaker 0: You want to get more of them.

410
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:28,490
Speaker 1: Why don't we just buy a set of them and buy like rent at warehouses that's going to be torn down?

411
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:34,550
Speaker 0: Well, this is the news, is that now they are actually selling these pods direct to peoples.

412
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,955
Speaker 0: Whoa.

413
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,169
Speaker 0: For money.

414
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:37,009
Speaker 1: How much money?

415
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,179
Speaker 0: You still can't afford it.

416
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:39,590
Speaker 0: Click on the link and see how much money it is.

417
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,898
Speaker 0: Did you send me?

418
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:40,370
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, you did.

419
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:45,049
Speaker 1: Because that DDR machine is only like five grand for a used fourth mix.

420
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,177
Speaker 0: Have a spare 100K?

421
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:49,510
Speaker 0: Why not pick up a limited edition Star Wars Battle Pod?

422
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,982
Speaker 1: That's, you know, so how many do you need?

423
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,990
Speaker 1: Like what's the maximum number you can play a game with?

424
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:58,410
Speaker 0: I don't know about it enough because Japan.

425
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:07,609
Speaker 1: Because I think I could spend the 400 grand to get like four of these for two on two or whatever and stick them- How are you going to recoup your monies?

426
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:16,530
Speaker 0: I would stick them in a space and charge admission in New York like a temporary- If you put them in Times Square, how much money do you think you could make on them in a day?

427
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,690
Speaker 1: This is what I have to calculate.

428
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,268
Speaker 0: You got to pay the rent and the electric bill too.

429
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,409
Speaker 0: And you got to maintain the machines.

430
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:24,439
Speaker 0: How long does the game last?

431
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:26,410
Speaker 0: How much can you charge someone to play it?

432
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,550
Speaker 1: That's what I got to figure out, but here's the other thing.

433
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:37,390
Speaker 1: What you do, you buy the machines, then you lease them continuously to people in different places to run these pop-up events.

434
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,130
Speaker 1: They're shouldering the real risk, not you, because if this doesn't go well, you own these things.

435
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,529
Speaker 1: You have an asset you can sell to recoup a good chunk of your losses.

436
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,990
Speaker 1: So all the risk is on the person who actually has to do all the things you're talking about.

437
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:51,630
Speaker 1: That's how you do it.

438
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,443
Speaker 0: All right, well do it.

439
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:53,412
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

440
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,309
Speaker 1: Because it'd be a bunch of work and I'd have to quit my job and like spend time on this.

441
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:01,829
Speaker 1: Oh my god, these things look really awesome.

442
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:05,049
Speaker 0: There's a video, you can see what this game is like.

443
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:11,550
Speaker 0: And why it is bullshit that, uh, why are these amazing world-class games only in one country?

444
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:15,790
Speaker 1: I wonder if Disney with all their Star Wars stuff...

445
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,106
Speaker 0: I'm sure if you go to Disney World, you can play this.

446
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're probably going to set up like a room of these for people to use.

447
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,730
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can play this at Disney World.

448
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,490
Speaker 0: Let's go to Disney.

449
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:24,587
Speaker 0: All right, let's go.

450
00:22:24,991 --> 00:22:27,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, once we confirm these are there.

451
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,550
Speaker 0: Once I quit my job next week, we'll just go to Disney World.

452
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,879
Speaker 1: Things of the day!

453
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:48,880
Speaker 1: So, I'm always a fan of when someone does like the subtle mashup, like there's a trailer or something, but they do like the add little subtle things to make it a trailer for something else.

454
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,440
Speaker 1: But the production values on this one are the subtlest and it's actually really funny.

455
00:22:54,801 --> 00:23:01,660
Speaker 0: I saw links to this all over the internet and I saw the title associated with the link and that was everything I needed to know, so I didn't even bother watching.

456
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,860
Speaker 0: And now that I've seen part of it, I didn't need to watch because it was everything that I imagined.

457
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:10,839
Speaker 1: It's so weirdly anti all Mad Max Fury Road and everything related to it.

458
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:12,740
Speaker 0: This has nothing to do with it being Mad Max.

459
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:13,498
Speaker 0: I think it is.

460
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,731
Speaker 0: It's just that this particular thing of the day is just sort of like, "All right, that's what I thought that was going to be.

461
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:17,812
Speaker 0: The

462
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:17,933
Speaker 0: end.".

463
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:19,384
Speaker 1: Really?

464
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:21,460
Speaker 1: Because usually these things are a lot less subtle.

465
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:29,420
Speaker 1: This has so many tiny, tiny little touches that I am impressed with the amount of effort someone spent into making this.

466
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,720
Speaker 1: This is just Mario Kart Fury Road.

467
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:36,439
Speaker 1: And the best part is that Waluigi stuff happening at the end.

468
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,138
Speaker 0: Waluigi's always good.

469
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:43,540
Speaker 1: The tiny bob-ombs stuck on the end of those grenade sticks.

470
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,750
Speaker 1: The little peach cap.

471
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:47,480
Speaker 1: This is pretty well done.

472
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:54,300
Speaker 1: Also, if you haven't seen Fury Road, it's the best action movie I've seen since The Matrix.

473
00:23:56,642 --> 00:24:01,440
Speaker 1: I can't name an action movie better than Fury Road since The Matrix.

474
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,879
Speaker 0: It's not like anyone's been making a lot of them.

475
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,078
Speaker 1: John Wick, however, was actually way better than I thought it was going to be.

476
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,999
Speaker 1: Because I'm way late to the party on that one.

477
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,546
Speaker 1: But yeah, go see Fury Road.

478
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,235
Speaker 1: It is Mad Max.

479
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:16,080
Speaker 1: The other movies fuck them.

480
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,252
Speaker 1: And watch this thing because it's pretty good.

481
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:18,936
Speaker 1: Pretty funny.

482
00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:19,420
Speaker 1: Pretty cute.

483
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,291
Speaker 0: So, there are many, many remixes and performances of video game musics.

484
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,380
Speaker 0: And none more than Mega Man 2.

485
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,469
Speaker 0: And none more than Dr.

486
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:37,060
Speaker 0: Wily's first stage, the one with the dragon in it theme.

487
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,928
Speaker 1: Oh, I saw links to this.

488
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:41,579
Speaker 1: I realized that I didn't need to actually click on it.

489
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,335
Speaker 1: Because there's just all these remixes of that song.

490
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:45,039
Speaker 1: Nothing new here.

491
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:46,638
Speaker 0: Except this one is something new.

492
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:54,799
Speaker 0: And that they have ventured into a musical genre that is not oft associated with video game remixes.

493
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:57,979
Speaker 0: And it is an excellent musical genre that I appreciate very much.

494
00:24:58,862 --> 00:24:59,217
Speaker 0: The mariachi.

495
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,250
Speaker 0: So, it's exactly what you would expect.

496
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,197
Speaker 0: It's a mariachi cover of Dr.

497
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:06,960
Speaker 0: Wily's song.

498
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:10,358
Speaker 0: But, that's a good thing that you want to listen to.

499
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,519
Speaker 0: So, go listen to it because it is enjoyable to do so.

500
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,540
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, we were temporarily delisted from iTunes.

501
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,380
Speaker 1: Our feed is now back online.

502
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:30,500
Speaker 1: So, if you got a "This show is no longer available in your country" warning in the last week, that is resolved.

503
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,380
Speaker 1: You should probably go resubscribe to Geek Nights if you unsubscribed.

504
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:40,740
Speaker 1: Also, if you're using the newest version of iTunes, it kind of fucked over podcasts in a big way.

505
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,339
Speaker 1: So, go poke at it a bit and it'll start working again.

506
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,454
Speaker 1: It does still have podcast support.

507
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:46,220
Speaker 1: You gotta fuck with it.

508
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:55,300
Speaker 1: If you have iTunes and are not subscribed to us in iTunes, do us a favor and just go subscribe there just to give us a little bump now that we're back.

509
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,280
Speaker 1: Because, podcasts are dead.

510
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:57,939
Speaker 0: Now, who cares?

511
00:25:58,421 --> 00:26:01,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we're trying to make a big bust out in the near future.

512
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,008
Speaker 0: Don't worry about helping us.

513
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,580
Speaker 0: What you should worry about more is helping yourself.

514
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,800
Speaker 0: And you should know that, I mean, you're listening to this show already, so you must care about Geek Nights somewhat, right?

515
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,100
Speaker 0: So, you can subscribe in iTunes, but they only let us... We used to have a bunch of feeds in there, now they only let us have one in there.

516
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,420
Speaker 0: So, only the last hundred, a tenth of Geek Nights is on iTunes.

517
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:23,520
Speaker 0: That gives you every Geek Nights episode, you know, that's recent.

518
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,334
Speaker 0: You know, so you always get new ones in that feed.

519
00:26:25,415 --> 00:26:25,980
Speaker 0: That's fine.

520
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,804
Speaker 0: Then we have a bunch of other feeds.

521
00:26:27,844 --> 00:26:32,200
Speaker 0: If you go to our website, in the top right, there's like a subscribe page that has all kinds of infos on it.

522
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:41,599
Speaker 0: And we have feeds, for example, you can subscribe just Monday, just Tuesday, just Wednesday, just Thursday, just book club, just... Weird episodes, which we haven't done one in a long time.

523
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,444
Speaker 0: Just special episodes.

524
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:45,660
Speaker 0: You could do random feed, which gives you random episodes.

525
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,480
Speaker 0: You could do... There's a feed that has every episode going back forever.

526
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,960
Speaker 0: You know, and not just the most recent hundred, which is like at some kind of iTunes limit, but like every episode ever, back to episode one.

527
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's over a thousand, guys.

528
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,040
Speaker 0: Yeah.

529
00:26:58,322 --> 00:27:01,780
Speaker 0: There are all kinds of feeds, every which way, shape, and size.

530
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,920
Speaker 0: So, you can subscribe to Geek Nights in the way most convenient to you.

531
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:15,800
Speaker 0: All you have to do is copy the URL to the feed, and go in iTunes, or whatever podcatcher you use, and go subscribe to podcast, and paste the URL in, and click OK.

532
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,683
Speaker 0: It's not hard.

533
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:19,300
Speaker 0: If you can listen to Geek Nights, you can accomplish that.

534
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,580
Speaker 0: You don't need to have it be listed in iTunes in order for you to subscribe successfully.

535
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:27,919
Speaker 0: So, that's that.

536
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:33,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I do know, like I was looking in the stats, just because I was trying to figure out all the iTunes stuff.

537
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:41,341
Speaker 1: People listen, like every now and then, like I see a bunch of people listen to episodes from like 2007, 2006.

538
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:45,340
Speaker 0: I think those are from Google searches, or links from some other forum.

539
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:51,300
Speaker 0: Someone finds a link to the one episode, somehow it's related to something they were searching for.

540
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,600
Speaker 1: It's interesting to see that almost every one of those old episodes gets like a couple of listens a week.

541
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:02,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like every single old episode of Geek Nights gets like one or two downloads a month, somehow, some way.

542
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,080
Speaker 0: I don't know if people are listening, but there's one or two downloads a month.

543
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,387
Speaker 0: It could just be every month.

544
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:08,780
Speaker 0: someone accidentally downloads every episode.

545
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:12,738
Speaker 0: But yeah, there you go.

546
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:15,832
Speaker 1: The book of the book is still Watership Down.

547
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:17,320
Speaker 1: Scott has not finished it yet.

548
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:19,440
Speaker 0: Since I'm not working, I have plenty of time for reading.

549
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,500
Speaker 1: Well, you said you'd finish it by Thursday.

550
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:26,140
Speaker 1: Or, I was going to change my next book selection.

551
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,140
Speaker 0: I guess I'm going to read it tomorrow.

552
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:28,988
Speaker 1: I mean, you don't have to.

553
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:29,573
Speaker 1: It's fine.

554
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:36,180
Speaker 1: It's totally fine, because I think we could do a show tomorrow on the current Eurovision.

555
00:28:36,743 --> 00:28:39,660
Speaker 0: I guess it's supposed to rain, actually, the rest of the week.

556
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,257
Speaker 1: Oh, you're real afraid of Le Comp de Monte Cristo, or perhaps the man in the mask of iron.

557
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,540
Speaker 1: You're afraid they're going to show up on your doorstep.

558
00:28:48,822 --> 00:28:50,260
Speaker 0: Well, the second one, I've seen like two different movies.

559
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:51,739
Speaker 1: Along with Alexandre Dumas.

560
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,500
Speaker 0: I've seen like two movie versions of Man in the Iron Mask, so I could probably bullshit that.

561
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,020
Speaker 0: But yeah, I can probably finish that by Thursday.

562
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,218
Speaker 1: It would be Monte Cristo.

563
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:02,520
Speaker 0: I can finish by Thursday.

564
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:03,800
Speaker 0: It would definitely be Monte Cristo.

565
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,280
Speaker 0: I've seen one anime version of that, which doesn't tell me shit.

566
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:17,880
Speaker 1: Actually, it's interesting, because a lot of the things the anime did were way better in a lot of ways than what the book does, but then the anime's end is just complete horseshit.

567
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:19,980
Speaker 0: I'll finish a book by Thursday.

568
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,002
Speaker 1: Good rabbit.

569
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:26,460
Speaker 1: If you don't, I'll happily do a show on Eurovision, because I got a lot to say about the current Eurovisions.

570
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,720
Speaker 0: I didn't watch enough Eurovisions.

571
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,458
Speaker 1: I've watched all of them.

572
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,024
Speaker 0: Whoa.

573
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:34,280
Speaker 1: I think that my favorite one- Well, I've watched almost all of them.

574
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,979
Speaker 1: Was there anything that is- There is no Sieben, Sieben, Sieben, Ein, Ein, Sieben.

575
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,359
Speaker 0: That's still the best thing ever.

576
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no Hard Rock Hallelujah.

577
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
Speaker 0: Well, that was a winner, actually.

578
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,400
Speaker 1: But there is one that is Georgia.

579
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,020
Speaker 1: Georgia is basically- It's a Disney villain.

580
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:53,100
Speaker 0: Okay.

581
00:29:53,342 --> 00:29:53,893
Speaker 1: It's just amazing.

582
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,020
Speaker 1: It's just this Disney villain queen singing in front of like white fire and smoke.

583
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,715
Speaker 1: Serbia's pretty good, too.

584
00:30:02,821 --> 00:30:05,660
Speaker 1: Sadly, a lot of them are really earnest pop ballads.

585
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:10,380
Speaker 0: Well, because that's what was winning, so people were copying what was winning.

586
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:11,859
Speaker 0: But I thought people don't want to win.

587
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:12,653
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

588
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,113
Speaker 1: Yeah.

589
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,039
Speaker 0: I don't understand it.

590
00:30:15,142 --> 00:30:20,539
Speaker 1: A lot of people were giving the Russian performers a lot of shit, and there's some funny stuff that happened.

591
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,579
Speaker 1: But I'll save that in case we do a show, or at least a news on Eurovision.

592
00:30:24,664 --> 00:30:24,860
Speaker 1: Okay.

593
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,314
Speaker 1: I'll save it.

594
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,258
Speaker 1: But yeah, Georgia.

595
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Speaker 1: That'll be my secondary thing of the day.

596
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,899
Speaker 1: Watch the Georgia performance.

597
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:37,000
Speaker 1: So, long, long, long time ago, long ages passed.

598
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,700
Speaker 1: I used to play Mega TF, Team Fortress.

599
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,180
Speaker 1: Not Team Fortress Classic, because that was some new wave bullshit.

600
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:48,000
Speaker 0: That was what the dumb young kids- That was on the Half-Life engines, and it came free with their Half-Lives.

601
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,956
Speaker 1: I remember, there was a time in gaming when if someone said, "Oh, I play Team Fortress Classic," they'd be like, "What the fuck, you

602
00:30:54,996 --> 00:30:55,258
Speaker 1: noob?".

603
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,260
Speaker 1: And now that's the old classic that everyone remembers.

604
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:00,251
Speaker 0: Well, because it was hard to play Mega TF.

605
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,680
Speaker 0: You had to have Quake, and not Quake 3.

606
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,339
Speaker 0: Quake 1 and 2 are not for the faint of heart.

607
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:11,600
Speaker 0: And in order to set them up, you had to get weird mods from weird places.

608
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,460
Speaker 0: Team Fortress Classic, it's like you had Half-Life, you had 1, and then eventually Steam.

609
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,959
Speaker 0: And that game was just there.

610
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:21,140
Speaker 0: It was just already there for you to double click and just play.

611
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:23,500
Speaker 0: And there were people playing it, and it just worked.

612
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:31,639
Speaker 1: But anyway, so these were old, fiddly, poorly documented, hard-as-fuck-to-learn games with way high skill caps.

613
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,140
Speaker 1: Team-based, individual skill mattered a lot.

614
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:38,700
Speaker 1: And, as much as I love them, they're also kind of horrible.

615
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,719
Speaker 1: I'm not going to pretend they weren't.

616
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:49,338
Speaker 1: Team Fortress 2 took that genre, replicated the parts that people cared about, and got rid of everything else.

617
00:31:49,901 --> 00:32:06,460
Speaker 1: They lowered the individual skill cap, heavily raised the team collective skill cap, and the requirements of team coordination, and made a game that was probably 100,000 times more successful than all the previous iterations of Team Fortress combined.

618
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,110
Speaker 0: Yep.

619
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,840
Speaker 1: The same thing just happened kind of with MOBAs.

620
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,539
Speaker 0: Well, not really, right?

621
00:32:12,121 --> 00:32:16,660
Speaker 0: So, Blizzard, you know, that's Valve doing it once, right?

622
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:19,559
Speaker 0: They were basically using the Blizzard formula when they made TF2.

623
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,720
Speaker 0: Blizzard has always done this, right?

624
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,640
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, RTSs are a thing, huh?

625
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:36,900
Speaker 0: Like, there was Dune, and there was Command... They're like, well, we'll just take that genre and stay true to what that genre is, but all the details we will polish the fuck out of and make perfect, right?

626
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:38,520
Speaker 0: There were MMOs all over the place.

627
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,919
Speaker 0: There were Everquests, there were MUDs, and Blizzard's like, we're just going to make World of Warcraft.

628
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,120
Speaker 0: It's still going to be fundamentally the same bullshit.

629
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:54,120
Speaker 0: But all the little details, we're going to polish the fuck out of them and make them absolutely perfect so that we're better than all the others of this exact same thing.

630
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:02,040
Speaker 1: So, like, it keeps the concepts, like, you know, holding an area and building up your XP and, like, are you too far pushing back and whatever.

631
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,060
Speaker 0: Hearthstone, right?

632
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,519
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, look at all these, you know, card games out there.

633
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,280
Speaker 0: Well, we'll just make one and polish the ever-living fuck out of it, and here you go.

634
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:12,599
Speaker 0: And that's exactly what they did.

635
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,840
Speaker 0: So, they've done it to the MOBA, Heroes of the Storm.

636
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:23,414
Speaker 0: This has been an alpha for a long time, but now it's beta, so anyone can play it, open beta, and it launches early June, so basically the game launched now,

637
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,398
Speaker 1: really,

638
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:28,879
Speaker 0: but there's still going to be some patches and some bugs until early June when it's the real release.

639
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,519
Speaker 1: Now, they made a big deal about how it's not a MOBA.

640
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:32,998
Speaker 0: It's a MOBA.

641
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,980
Speaker 1: They don't call, they said it's not a MOBA.

642
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:35,780
Speaker 0: What is it?

643
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:36,780
Speaker 1: We don't call it a MOBA.

644
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,198
Speaker 1: Alright.

645
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,040
Speaker 1: The genre that they call it.

646
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,659
Speaker 0: It's multiplayer, it's online, you battle in an arena.

647
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:43,177
Speaker 1: It is, this is a genre.

648
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,518
Speaker 1: It's a multiplayer online battle arena.

649
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,060
Speaker 1: And I quote, hero brawler.

650
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:56,500
Speaker 0: It is a hero game, yes, and there is also brawling, you could also say that Dota and LoL and Heroes of Newerth are also hero brawlers.

651
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,679
Speaker 1: Oh wow, this article's pretty good.

652
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,919
Speaker 1: It is a sentence that sums up literally everything you care about knowing about this game if you've ever played a MOBA.

653
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:13,431
Speaker 1: Quote, "Heroes of the Storm will feature shared experience, no last hitting, no item purchasing, and all skills unlocked at the start of a match,

654
00:34:13,473 --> 00:34:13,795
Speaker 1: period.".

655
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:14,955
Speaker 0: Yes.

656
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:18,840
Speaker 1: Anyone who's played a MOBA, that's all you need to know.

657
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:32,368
Speaker 0: So basically, I was hoping, right, as, you know, with the expectation is that, you know, MOBAs, as much as we rag on them and, you know, say things about them, the core, there is a core of gameplay there.

658
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:34,760
Speaker 0: that is great, that I enjoy, that I want.

659
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:37,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm on a team, we're working together.

660
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,840
Speaker 0: You're on a team, you're working together.

661
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,040
Speaker 1: Directly fighting other people in an environment that itself matters.

662
00:34:43,620 --> 00:35:00,400
Speaker 0: Right, you're combining player versus environment and player versus player, there's strategy, there's teamwork, the game has this sort of arc of, like, build up and come down, right, there's a flow to it, it's not something that's over in two seconds, there's drama.

663
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:07,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's drama, there's potential for big drama, like, oh shit, they stacked one of the lanes, oh they're busting through, oh shit.

664
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:11,500
Speaker 0: There's skill based gameplay at the same time, there's a lot of skill caps.

665
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:17,939
Speaker 0: Right, there's a lot of good things going on in MOBAs, but the details of MOBAs have always been bad.

666
00:35:18,480 --> 00:36:16,000
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you want to choose, you know, you pick a hero, but obviously that chooses, like, your core, but, you know, much like a D&D character, you sort of, you know, can go down different paths and you can choose that either based on the beginning of the game, you can choose something, or as the game progresses, you can realize, oh, building my character in this way might be better, it's almost like if you were playing Magic the Gathering and could add cards to your, you started with one card in your deck, and that, or ten cards in your deck that you choose before the game starts, and as the game goes, you choose other cards to go in your deck, sort of like Dominion in a way, right, and then, you know, you're building as you go to deal with the situation, and that was represented in other MOBAs by the item shop, and in the item shop, basically, you have to farm gold to get enough gold to go to the item shop, and then you have to realize, you have to learn what all these fucking items do, and figure out which combinations of items are gonna get you to go with your character, and it takes a long time to learn this bullshit.

667
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:26,979
Speaker 1: And it's not, like, the multiplicative, like, common, like, the number of items, it's not just a Pareto Frontier, like, if you get two items that don't complement each other, or the wrong order, or whatever, you're fucked.

668
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:27,558
Speaker 0: Yup.

669
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,340
Speaker 0: Completely fucked.

670
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:49,499
Speaker 0: So, in Heroes of the Storm, they get rid of the item shop, which is great, because you don't have to, like, stop playing, it's for so many reasons, you don't have to learn all these stupid items, right, you just have to learn the talents, which are much more easier to remember, and there's much fewer choices to make, but they still amount to the same strategic decision, it's just been, you know, uh, abstracted away,

671
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:49,639
Speaker 1: right?

672
00:36:49,820 --> 00:37:10,760
Speaker 1: Well, see, also, Team Fortress, so in the old, like, in Weapons Factory, the old game, as a Marine, like, the area denial guy, I had one grenade that I could throw two of, they lasted, I think, 45 seconds, and they left, like, little turrets that would shoot railguns out of them, then I had two other kinds of grenades that did different kinds of area denial, and I'd use them in combination, depending on the terrain, and the tactics, and whatever.

673
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,640
Speaker 1: In TF2, you have the Demoman, he has one weapon, the area denial weapon.

674
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:17,258
Speaker 0: Yup.

675
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:26,140
Speaker 1: So the choice is, area denial or not, as opposed to area denial, then, what flavor, what circumstance, what time, what timing?

676
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:33,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, for example, you'll choose a character, and you'll choose, maybe, a warrior character, so warrior characters are typically the tanks, right?

677
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,920
Speaker 0: Your role is to go into a battle first, 'cause you, it's hard to kill, you have a ton of hit points.

678
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:38,781
Speaker 1: You do

679
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:56,180
Speaker 0: a bunch of damage, you'll, it's like, you're hard to kill, so the enemy has to focus on you, but you can also, maybe, disable or trap the enemies in a bad spot, then the assassin characters will come in, they're the glass cannons, basically, and do a bunch of damage and kill the enemies before you die, or maybe you do die, but they don't die, right?

680
00:37:56,561 --> 00:37:59,180
Speaker 0: Pretty typical basic strategy going on here, right?

681
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:06,620
Speaker 0: If you're built, if you're a tank character, like, the first talent you choose might be something like a choice between, like, four different things.

682
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:15,518
Speaker 0: One of them might be like, um, yeah, this ability that you have is, uh, gets mana whenever you use it.

683
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:23,400
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, well, if I choose that path, I'm gonna be using that ability a lot, and using my abilities in general a lot, because I'm gonna be replenishing mana a lot.

684
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:39,080
Speaker 0: If I choose the second one, which is like, regen HP whenever you hit someone with a basic attack, and it's like, oh, if I go down that path, then I will be hitting guys with my basic attack a lot, and it'd be really hard to kill me, so my strategy would be go into battle and just use regular attack.

685
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:49,239
Speaker 1: So think about what that does, based on your choices, you're saying, of the, like, four or five things my character can do on a broad strategic scale, I'm gonna be a little bit better at one of them.

686
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:59,780
Speaker 0: Right, and then, when you get to level four, and you choose another talent, the first one's gonna be like, hey, that ability that you could use that gets you, like, extra mana, now if you use that ability, it does extra damage.

687
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,700
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, well, obviously that goes with the ability I already, you know, and the second choice would be like, oh, get a little shield whenever you kill a regular old bad guy.

688
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:17,480
Speaker 0: It's like, ah, that makes me harder to kill, so it's like, But at the same time, those abilities require a little bit more skill to use effectively.

689
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:33,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, you gotta kill a regular, you gotta be like, in a battle, you have to have the mindset to, like, kill a regular bad guy to get a shield to show up, so it blocks you when the, 'cause it only happens for, like, a few seconds, when the real bad guy hero comes to actually hit you, that shield is there still, and now you fuck him up.

690
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:51,160
Speaker 0: So, you know, you basically, instead of choosing, like, oh, I need to get this item and this item and this item, you only have, like, four, every four levels or so, you make a choice, there's only four or five choices, they matter a lot, but it's easier to learn, it's easier to get into, but it has just as much depth, they're just getting rid of the bullshit part.

691
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:57,480
Speaker 0: And every other aspect of the game, you know, from the last hittings, there's none of that, right?

692
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,476
Speaker 0: You know, every other part of the game, they've done the same thing.

693
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:09,080
Speaker 0: You don't want to destroy your own base, you destroy the other guy's base, when do you push, which lane do you push in, you still need to farm XP, but not as much, right?

694
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:58,425
Speaker 0: The one big change to the game they added was these objectives, so you never know what kind of map you're gonna play on, there's only so many maps, but you don't know which one it's gonna be, and so, for example, each map has this objective you have to do at certain intervals, so you'll be just playing the game, and suddenly, the game will be like, oh my god, oh my god, objective time, so everyone basically stops just sitting in their lane doing whatever they were doing and has to go do the objective, you can not do the objective, you don't have to go do it, but then your team will be royally fucked if you don't do it, because succeeding at the objective, your team succeeds at it exceptionally, does serious damage to the other team, for example, there's a map with a pirate, he goes argh, and the way it works is you get coins, and it's weird.

695
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:03,746
Speaker 0: thematically because he gives you the treasure, he puts the treasure out there and wants you to give it back to him,

696
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:05,191
Speaker 1: he's a really bad pirate,

697
00:41:05,894 --> 00:42:51,540
Speaker 0: but there's also some bad guys you can kill that you can get treasure from, just environmental bad guys that just stand there waiting for you to kill them to get treasure from them, so you collect treasure, and if you get killed while you're holding coins, your coins spill out and your enemy takes them, or your friends pick them up, and there's one spot where the pirate is standing, he's not always there, but he's sometimes there, and if you go over to him, and you right click on him, a little timer thing will happen, and if you manage to stand there without getting killed until that timer finishes completely, you will give him all the coins you are holding, and if you give him, as a team, collectively, enough coins to meet his requirement, he will then disappear into his ship, and fire cannonballs at the enemy base, like holy fuck, blow them up to smithereens, and then he'll stop doing that, and then the coin thing will happen again, but the more you give him coins, the more coins he wants from you, it's like the first time, it's like 10 from either team, but then the team that did it already, he wants 12 from that team to do it again, but the other team still only needs 10, so it sort of scales up, but if your team is doing better, you'll be able to go like 10, 12, 14, whatever, and the other team won't even be able to get the 10, if they suck, right, so these objectives sort of give you, they sort of help guide the players into like knowing what to do, because a lot of the problems in the dodas and the lols, is you go out there, and it's like you go to a lane, and you fight, and it's like what should I do, should I try to kill the enemies now, am I strong enough, should I try to push and go for their base now, as like they're leveling up and we're leveling up, what, you know, do I switch lanes, what am I supposed to do here, this is like, it's telling you what to do, it's like alright everyone, right now go into the cave and collect skulls, so no matter how noob you are, some people obviously can't figure this out.

698
00:42:51,580 --> 00:43:04,825
Speaker 0: I've seen in a lot of games, people are like what are the skulls, how to seeds, what, like they don't understand this, but even though the game is telling them in English like go into the cave and get the skulls people don't get it, but

699
00:43:04,845 --> 00:43:06,270
Speaker 1: they don't know what a skull is, most

700
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,899
Speaker 0: people get it, and especially people who played it.

701
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:19,759
Speaker 0: you know, before get it, it took me like one game to understand, like I knew I had to get on one map gems and turn them in, I had gems, I couldn't figure out where to turn them in, and I kept asking and my teammates wouldn't tell me.

702
00:43:21,781 --> 00:43:51,460
Speaker 0: eventually I figured it out, now I've figured out all the maps, there's not too many of them, but it's like once you figure it out it's like when the event happens, you know what to do, you don't need some coordinate, you still need to coordinate but everyone in your team, without ever having known each other in life, without being on some chat server or anything will go towards the objective and start working on it and naturally come together, so it helps you out in doing that, and it also gives you a reward, you know, in terms of if you succeed at it, awesome shit happens.

703
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:56,520
Speaker 0: So that's the major difference between this and the other MOBAs, is the objectives on the map.

704
00:43:56,741 --> 00:44:29,340
Speaker 1: Now my worry, that seems to be echoed by a lot of people, but I don't know, because the game hasn't, like it has to be out for real and we have to see what the equilibrium is, my worry is that, like I always suspected, if you polish games, like Team Fortress 2 wasn't really fun in the long run, at least for me, and for a lot of people, the competitive scene is not strong in that game because skilled teams are basically equal in skill to each other due to the way the caps are, like individual skill doesn't have that much input in the game above a certain point.

705
00:44:29,881 --> 00:44:35,600
Speaker 1: so the competitive scene has no way to differentiate one pro from another, or one pro team from another.

706
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:43,820
Speaker 1: and also, if you remove all the fiddly shit, the game's a little boring because there isn't that much to actually do.

707
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:51,519
Speaker 1: fundamentally, it's still a MOBA, well, a hero brawler, in that you are waiting to level up.

708
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:56,820
Speaker 1: go stand somewhere, and the decision might be, do I stand here, or do I stand here?

709
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,660
Speaker 0: You keep moving around a lot so you can't get hit by anything, that's what you do.

710
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:11,152
Speaker 1: But, you're just leveling up, it's a leveling game, what I hate about MOBAs as a genre is that at their core, they are passive strategy games and this is true, 100%, Heroes of the Storm.

711
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,460
Speaker 1: I don't think you're picking on MOBAs, fighting games have a very similar, but it's a different problem, but it's the same core problem.

712
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:30,380
Speaker 0: Despite polishing away all the small imperfections and frustrations, as Blizzard has done, and all their other genres of game it is still fundamentally a MOBA, it still has all the same problems that all MOBAs have.

713
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:48,000
Speaker 0: If one person on your team doesn't get it, and they're just staying in the top lane and not joining your team while you go around killing the other team every time you meet the other team it's gonna be 5 on 4, and you're gonna get hosed and then they're gonna go kill that guy who's only 1, and then they're gonna kill your base and there's nothing you can do about it, right?

714
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:52,260
Speaker 0: So you're stuck on a team with a bad player, you just wanna quit, they don't let you concede.

715
00:45:52,782 --> 00:45:57,740
Speaker 0: you have to sit there and wait for the game to finish, so people just stand in their base not doing anything.

716
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:08,420
Speaker 0: Another thing they've done is because the skill cap is so low, and because the objective is so strong you do actually have a very good chance of coming back in games that feel like you've lost.

717
00:46:09,263 --> 00:46:14,700
Speaker 0: So the other team gets the objective, your base is blown to shit, you all die, you all respawn.

718
00:46:15,502 --> 00:46:24,580
Speaker 0: You actually, at that moment, have an incredibly good chance of winning because they're beat up from basically pushing where your team is totally fresh, you just all spawned.

719
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,980
Speaker 1: And then oh hey, another objective!

720
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:33,840
Speaker 0: If you all team up, you can go and kill them, their entire team, they will be not respawning for a while.

721
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:46,399
Speaker 0: If the objective happens, you can go get the objective unopposed while they're waiting to respawn and then start pushing, I've lost a lot of games when teams have done that, and won a lot of games when my team has done that.

722
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:53,860
Speaker 1: Now the timing on that, it might come down to like, how strict timed are the objectives gonna be in the final game?

723
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:07,720
Speaker 1: I mean there's a clock, I still don't know when they're gonna happen, but the interval is pretty regular Because when I used to play really heavy Quake 2, like Lithium Deathmatch, among the skilled players, one of the big factors.

724
00:47:08,002 --> 00:47:19,760
Speaker 1: If you know this game, you know exactly when everything's going to happen Exactly, but people would memorize, you'd see literally the second before the quad damage reappears, like six people appear in that room.

725
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:29,540
Speaker 0: That's exactly right, so the problem here is that yes, you can come back, which is great, you're not out of the game.

726
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:36,440
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be conceding and standing still waiting for the game to end, because you can come back, almost until the very end, you do have a chance.

727
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,560
Speaker 1: Yes, the positional heuristic is kind of obscure.

728
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:47,440
Speaker 0: The game does a very bad job of letting you believe that you can come back, so people do just give up too early.

729
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:51,648
Speaker 0: So it's like we could have come back, right?

730
00:47:51,728 --> 00:47:56,560
Speaker 0: We did have a chance, and I know we have a chance, because I know the game, I've been playing it for a couple days.

731
00:47:56,961 --> 00:48:02,678
Speaker 0: But these other people don't believe that we have a chance, they're just random internet people, so they just stay in base.

732
00:48:02,738 --> 00:48:07,120
Speaker 0: and now we don't Because we only had a chance if everyone believed it and went for it.

733
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:25,420
Speaker 1: Now meanwhile, look at the psychology of the old natural selection, I don't know if it happens as much in the new natural selection But people believe they could come back even when they mathematically could not The game, for whatever reason, the way it felt when you played, people would believe to their dying breath that they could come back if they just hold out.

734
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,080
Speaker 0: That is one major design flaw in the game, it does a bad job of getting you to believe you can come back.

735
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:32,048
Speaker 0: But I think that that is not a problem.

736
00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:38,580
Speaker 1: if you're playing with better players or organized players You need an alien commander to be like "Yeah, we can do it, come on guys, come on bombers".

737
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,619
Speaker 0: Or you have a team and you're not just playing with random internet people.

738
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:54,759
Speaker 1: In general, games like this have a horrible random internet person experience, I think Yeah, well I've been reporting everyone who's horrible and the fact is, you know, while there have been horribles It's not Heroes of New Earth.

739
00:48:54,921 --> 00:48:58,580
Speaker 0: The percentage is actually like one horrible for every five games.

740
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:07,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, as opposed to Heroes of New Earth, which is like one horrible for every .5 games And the one horrible in every five games usually gets reported by like one game, everyone's just like "Just report that guy".

741
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,680
Speaker 0: And I'm like "I reported him like a minute ago".

742
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,740
Speaker 0: The only problem is that while you're reporting someone, you're standing still not playing the game And then you lose because you had to report someone.

743
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:20,279
Speaker 0: But if you had someone on your team you needed to report, you're losing anyway.

744
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:34,860
Speaker 1: So I guess what no one's done with MOBAs is instead of trying to refine and narrow and keep the core Fundamentally change the genre, but keep just the team battling aspect.

745
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,960
Speaker 0: Counter Strike has team battling, but it's completely different from MOBAs.

746
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:40,943
Speaker 1: All I think they need to do Well, they Anyone.

747
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:51,760
Speaker 1: The best way to make MOBAs like a new transcendent genre is to make the lanes a dynamic thing that you build and maintain.

748
00:49:51,964 --> 00:49:59,600
Speaker 1: That could be interesting And/or the goon generators controllable and configurable like a baby's first RTS alongside the regular game.

749
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:04,080
Speaker 0: Well, one other interesting thing that's in Heroes of the Storm different from the other MOBAs, right.

750
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:09,759
Speaker 0: Is that in say Dota, there's the jungle, which is where you go to fight AI creatures to level up.

751
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:20,240
Speaker 0: basically In Heroes of the Storm, you can do this, but what happens when you fight them is you actually recruit them onto your team And they will go into the nearest lane and start fighting after you beat.

752
00:50:21,067 --> 00:50:22,600
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't play enough to bump into that.

753
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:35,918
Speaker 0: They'll be like two giant ogres just sitting there like If you go over and fight them like they're tough, but you go there with your whole team and you beat them real quick And then they will at full health like reappear and go down a lane and fuck up the other team.

754
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:36,480
Speaker 0: real bad.

755
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:46,280
Speaker 1: But I say take that to one more degree, like imagine a MOBA where you all start Say MOBA, here's the storm, imagine here's the storm straight up But there aren't lanes, but there's shit out in the middle of the map in a few places.

756
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:52,760
Speaker 1: And then to get resources in the beginning of the game, you start digging in the mine.

757
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:56,063
Speaker 0: Right, well I have a better idea even more than that, right Is that?

758
00:50:56,143 --> 00:51:03,355
Speaker 0: MOBA is this leveling aspect which no matter how you refine it And even in Heroes of the Storm where a couple levels you can still come back.

759
00:51:03,415 --> 00:51:07,596
Speaker 0: if you're a couple levels behind And your whole team is always the same level, all the experience is 100% shared.

760
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:11,119
Speaker 0: You don't have like one person who's way high level and the other people, right?

761
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,838
Speaker 0: Everyone is always the same level on your team.

762
00:51:15,362 --> 00:51:18,659
Speaker 0: Even with that, if your team is a couple levels behind, you can still come back.

763
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,440
Speaker 0: But why is there even leveling to begin with?

764
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,340
Speaker 0: Instead, I think it should be the opposite.

765
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:32,070
Speaker 0: Everyone should start out at the beginning of the game as ridiculously powerful heroes With all kinds of shit, right?

766
00:51:32,311 --> 00:51:38,740
Speaker 0: All the magic spells and mana and items And glory be, we are the mightiest heroes who have ever existed.

767
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:41,460
Speaker 0: And you go into a battle, and what happens in a battle?

768
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,620
Speaker 0: You get fucking worn ass out, right?

769
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,580
Speaker 1: Oh, so you start high, but then you have to rebuild, maintain, preserve.

770
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:52,340
Speaker 0: I mean, you can't even rebuild during a battle, right?

771
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:01,030
Speaker 1: No, what I imagine is you start as Rome at its peak and slowly you're using busted old Roman shit Like you cast your spell.

772
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:17,019
Speaker 0: It's like, well now my magic is getting weaker because I'm using it up, I'm getting drained here And just go out there and everyone on both teams, who can grind the other team down into dust first And it gets more dramatic as it goes down.

773
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,220
Speaker 1: So what I think is between, you know, Heroes of Newer Earth, it's a terrible game and it's basically dead.

774
00:52:22,622 --> 00:52:25,952
Speaker 1: But there's, there's Dota 2 and LoL.

775
00:52:26,363 --> 00:52:28,880
Speaker 1: Yes, there's LoL The big one And now there's Heroes of the Storm.

776
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,800
Speaker 1: These three have refined like the three ways to go with MOBAs as they are known.

777
00:52:35,509 --> 00:52:36,078
Speaker 1: They're it.

778
00:52:36,702 --> 00:52:39,094
Speaker 1: I think there is no more refinement.

779
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,380
Speaker 1: that really is going to be had.

780
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:44,460
Speaker 1: The next step is someone doing one of the kinds of things like we're talking about?

781
00:52:44,902 --> 00:52:48,218
Speaker 0: I mean, you got games like Awesomenauts, just like a 2D platform MOBA, right?

782
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:56,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like every one of those games just doesn't have the traction or the like, I don't know, I don't like them Nope And I don't, it's not even like.

783
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:59,740
Speaker 1: I look at them and say, wow, that's not for me, but I know who it's for.

784
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,040
Speaker 1: I look at it and say, wow, people are going to get bored with that for a couple hours.

785
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,620
Speaker 0: It's just like you play these games and there's like this aspect of goodness like, oh, I want this part.

786
00:53:06,701 --> 00:53:14,420
Speaker 0: And then there's just so many other parts that are like, no And they've managed to remove all the fiddly ones, but they couldn't fix the core.

787
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:15,960
Speaker 0: Same thing with the World of Warcraft, right?

788
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:22,740
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, you know, you'd play like some mud back in the day and be like, wow, I need so much experience to the next level.

789
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:25,100
Speaker 0: This is like not worth my time, fuck this.

790
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, I needed a thousand experience points to get to level 77 in the realm.

791
00:53:30,461 --> 00:53:35,900
Speaker 0: World of Warcraft is like we have made the perfect XP curve and we have made, everything is perfect.

792
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,580
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh my God, it's amazing, but oh, I'm still just grinding and leveling up.

793
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:44,239
Speaker 0: The fundamental thing hasn't changed, you've just perfected that fundamental thing.

794
00:53:45,501 --> 00:53:55,100
Speaker 1: So if you want to be on the bleeding edge of like the next generation of MOBAs Take the existing refinements from the three games that sort of came out on top.

795
00:53:55,622 --> 00:54:01,879
Speaker 1: Turn 90 degrees on one of those aspects and go crazy But keep everything else the same.

796
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,599
Speaker 0: I guess we should pay like at least a minute to talk about the money aspect of this game.

797
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:13,180
Speaker 0: So it's sort of the same thing as League of Legends where there's free heroes that you can, every week they change.

798
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:14,859
Speaker 0: So they just change like today, right?

799
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:17,009
Speaker 0: So you always have like a few heroes.

800
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:19,480
Speaker 0: you can play no matter what and every week it changes.

801
00:54:19,701 --> 00:54:22,200
Speaker 0: So if you find a hero you like, you sort of have to buy them.

802
00:54:22,401 --> 00:54:24,780
Speaker 0: You can buy them with gold or real money.

803
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:26,720
Speaker 0: Different heroes have different prices.

804
00:54:26,942 --> 00:54:29,140
Speaker 0: What makes a hero more or less expensive than another one?

805
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,920
Speaker 0: I don't know if they just decide it somehow.

806
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:41,180
Speaker 0: Some heroes are easier, weaker to use, some are from Starcraft, some are from Wark, whatever To get gold, when you first start playing, you can get a lot of gold, right?

807
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,494
Speaker 0: Because you are leveling up, right?

808
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:50,740
Speaker 0: Your account levels up But you also level up each player, each hero outside of any individual game, you level up the heroes.

809
00:54:52,002 --> 00:54:55,740
Speaker 0: When you get any particular hero to level 5, you get like a gold bonus.

810
00:54:56,262 --> 00:55:00,780
Speaker 0: So every given week there's like some number of heroes you can play for free.

811
00:55:01,442 --> 00:55:06,680
Speaker 0: You gotta play enough games to level each hero up to level 5 and you get all the gold bonuses for them.

812
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:10,860
Speaker 0: Eventually you have the gold bonus for every hero and you can get tons of gold that way.

813
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,700
Speaker 0: You also get gold bonuses when you level up yourself which you just get by just playing.

814
00:55:15,222 --> 00:55:18,920
Speaker 0: You also have daily quests just like Hearthstone where you can get gold from those.

815
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:20,879
Speaker 0: It's like there'll be a quest, like play 8 games.

816
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:25,260
Speaker 1: Now I see what they're kind of doing there, like it sort of forces people to play a bunch of different heroes.

817
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:29,460
Speaker 1: Don't always only play Princess Peach in Smash Brothers Rim, play a different character.

818
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,172
Speaker 0: Now that's good and all, right?

819
00:55:31,192 --> 00:55:32,260
Speaker 0: You can get gold this way.

820
00:55:32,421 --> 00:55:50,189
Speaker 0: But even if you do all the quests and level up all the heroes and do all this stuff Eventually your person, your account gets to level 30 which unlocks the super mode Where you actually play with drafting characters and you're playing with more serious players The amount of gold that you will earn.

821
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:57,977
Speaker 0: even if you do everything you can do by the time you get there You will not have enough heroes unlocked to play that mode.

822
00:55:58,499 --> 00:56:04,460
Speaker 0: well You join that mode and you're playing free and you just got to level 30 and you join that mode.

823
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:12,180
Speaker 0: People will be hella pissed at you because they want to draft a certain character to counter the other team And you don't have that character and so you can't pick that one.

824
00:56:12,261 --> 00:56:18,057
Speaker 0: You have to pick one of the characters that you have paid for And it's just like, you don't have all the magic cards, so we're fucked.

825
00:56:19,224 --> 00:56:25,280
Speaker 0: You're fucking our team by coming in here and not having enough So you have to pay money and they're charging stupid money.

826
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:27,151
Speaker 0: You'll be like, "Oh, you want to play as this character?

827
00:56:27,493 --> 00:56:28,237
Speaker 0: Ten fucking

828
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:28,620
Speaker 0: bucks!".

829
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,287
Speaker 0: It's like, "Fuck

830
00:56:29,368 --> 00:56:29,530
Speaker 0: you!".

831
00:56:30,482 --> 00:56:31,193
Speaker 0: "You play Street

832
00:56:31,234 --> 00:56:31,539
Speaker 0: Fighter!".

833
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,837
Speaker 0: You'll be like, "Oh, you can have ambison for

834
00:56:33,877 --> 00:56:34,038
Speaker 0: free!".

835
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:34,908
Speaker 0: "Oh, Guile?

836
00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:35,273
Speaker 0: Ten

837
00:56:35,313 --> 00:56:35,597
Speaker 0: bucks!".

838
00:56:35,901 --> 00:56:36,693
Speaker 1: "Fuck you, Cap!

839
00:56:36,713 --> 00:56:36,794
Speaker 1: You

840
00:56:36,835 --> 00:56:36,997
Speaker 1: can't!".

841
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,120
Speaker 0: That's bullshit, right?

842
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,137
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh, and how many hours would you have to play to unlock

843
00:56:42,197 --> 00:56:42,600
Speaker 0: Guile?".

844
00:56:42,861 --> 00:56:45,640
Speaker 0: You'd have to play ten games a day for a month to unlock Guile.

845
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,200
Speaker 0: It's like, that is horseshit.

846
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:53,279
Speaker 1: Now, at the same time, that model seems to increasingly be dominating multiplayer spaces.

847
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,480
Speaker 0: Dota does not have this model, right?

848
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,620
Speaker 0: This is the one thing Dota is doing right.

849
00:56:57,842 --> 00:56:58,426
Speaker 0: You have everything.

850
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:01,320
Speaker 0: Everything is free.

851
00:57:01,582 --> 00:57:14,160
Speaker 0: We're only going to charge you for cosmetic shit And that is why, as a competitive, serious game While Dota has bullshit in its game mechanics while you're playing It doesn't have any bullshit outside of that.

852
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,960
Speaker 0: The only thing that costs money is cosmetic nonsense Skins and mounts and whatever.

853
00:57:19,242 --> 00:57:21,380
Speaker 0: And they have cosmetic skins and mounts for money.

854
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:22,723
Speaker 0: Heroes of the Storm 2.

855
00:57:22,723 --> 00:57:25,953
Speaker 0: But if you're a smart person, you just ignore that bullshit And ride the normal horse.

856
00:57:26,054 --> 00:57:26,459
Speaker 0: that's free.

857
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:29,659
Speaker 0: Why do you need to ride the pig or the rainbow unicorn for ten bucks?

858
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,739
Speaker 1: Rainbow unicorn, come on!

859
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,320
Speaker 0: Are you going to pay ten bucks for the rainbow unicorn?

860
00:57:32,641 --> 00:57:34,200
Speaker 1: Scott, what if for ten bucks it was Rainbow Dash?

861
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:44,230
Speaker 0: It's always funny, though, when someone does pay ten bucks for the rainbow unicorn And they suck, and it's just like When you suck so bad that I who suck can tell that you suck And you paid twenty bucks for the skins.

862
00:57:45,201 --> 00:57:53,113
Speaker 1: The other night, I was playing Counter Strike And I'm not that good, I'm an old man I'm pretty good at Counter Strike, but I'm not But there's someone who's so bad?

863
00:57:53,133 --> 00:57:54,119
Speaker 0: you headshot them every time.

864
00:57:54,281 --> 00:58:06,537
Speaker 1: So I was playing with the pistol Just like demolition mode And I'm on this really good team Super A-game people In terms of being funny And we were all similar to skill level And it was a good game.

865
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:12,340
Speaker 1: But then someone had to leave And someone joined our team And they sucked, they were really bad.

866
00:58:12,662 --> 00:58:18,878
Speaker 1: And they kept, like, every round Between the rounds, I'd play my harmonica And everyone got really into it, and we had this thing going on.

867
00:58:19,382 --> 00:58:21,055
Speaker 1: And then the guy was like, "What the fuck with the

868
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:21,620
Speaker 1: harmonica?".

869
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,076
Speaker 1: And then everyone else was like, "Dude, the harmonica is the only reason we're winning, calm the fuck

870
00:58:25,116 --> 00:58:25,417
Speaker 1: down.".

871
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:27,660
Speaker 1: And it kept escalating and escalating.

872
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:33,720
Speaker 1: And then finally, the guys really suck And it came down until we were tied And this guy was the last one alive.

873
00:58:33,782 --> 00:58:34,120
Speaker 0: You're dead.

874
00:58:34,505 --> 00:58:39,660
Speaker 1: All he had to do Was not get shot Because they didn't have time to plant the bomb.

875
00:58:39,843 --> 00:58:40,560
Speaker 1: It was too late.

876
00:58:40,743 --> 00:58:41,599
Speaker 0: Oh, he just had to run away.

877
00:58:41,842 --> 00:58:47,560
Speaker 1: And he runs up on the roof And starts shooting at the guy with his pistol Of course And gets headshotted.

878
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,287
Speaker 0: He doesn't know that.

879
00:58:48,348 --> 00:58:49,540
Speaker 0: all he has to do is run away.

880
00:58:49,722 --> 00:58:53,900
Speaker 0: So then, in our voice chat And you can't hear him, he can't hear you telling him that because it's Ghost.

881
00:58:54,182 --> 00:59:03,875
Speaker 1: So in our voice chat, one of my fine friends From this amazing group of people Just notices and says, "Whoa, that skin he's using costs like a hundred

882
00:59:03,936 --> 00:59:04,239
Speaker 1: bucks.".

883
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,368
Speaker 0: And then someone else is like,

884
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:08,354
Speaker 0: "Ha!"

885
00:59:09,443 --> 00:59:13,819
Speaker 0: Maybe he got it randomly And just happened to like it and use it Not realizing it was worth a hundred bucks.

886
00:59:14,244 --> 00:59:15,758
Speaker 0: But probably he paid a hundred bucks.

887
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,877
Speaker 1: It was a good moment And then we all voted to kick him.

888
00:59:21,286 --> 00:59:34,594
Speaker 0: Yeah So if you want to play a MOBA For a short while Before you get sick of it And realize you're going to have to pay money to buy a hero For like ten dollars And then you're going to say, "Fuck this

889
00:59:34,635 --> 00:59:34,816
Speaker 0: shit.".

890
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:37,619
Speaker 0: Up until that point, you can play, this is free, why not?

891
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:45,738
Speaker 0: If you want to make the next generation of MOBA's Play this, hire me as a consultant So I don't have to stay at the job I have now.

892
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:51,196
Speaker 1: Ah, consultants All you have to do is tell other people what to do But you don't have to actually do it.
