Speaker 0: I'm sky and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:21,278
Speaker 1: I Was gonna feel I was sitting there thinking like you have no idea what you're gonna say for the title of the show.

5
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:24,298
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:32,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had no idea what I was gonna call this episode and you know normally I can just say something.

7
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:33,386
Speaker 0: it's like tonight.

8
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:38,960
Speaker 0: we're talking about ducks, but There was no one word to say what we're talking about back.

9
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:41,065
Speaker 0: Should we do a show on ducks?

10
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:43,996
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about ducks except that they're tasty.

11
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:45,100
Speaker 0: Well, you never had a pet duck.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,124
Speaker 1: No, really?

13
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:48,108
Speaker 1: You didn't either.

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,830
Speaker 0: Uh, yes.

15
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:51,560
Speaker 0: Actually I did an actual duck an actual duck for a while.

16
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:52,488
Speaker 1: How was it?

17
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:53,680
Speaker 1: You're how did you take care of it?

18
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:58,587
Speaker 0: It was a rescue duck and we raised him and then when he was old enough We have a pond for it to live in.

19
00:00:58,768 --> 00:00:59,692
Speaker 0: we had a kiddie pool.

20
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:01,440
Speaker 1: You left the duck in the kiddie pool.

21
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:03,587
Speaker 1: It didn't fly away.

22
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,580
Speaker 0: No, he walked around the garage and he packed it.

23
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:08,279
Speaker 1: I didn't need a big duck to follow around a little duck train.

24
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:12,098
Speaker 1: You have wooden ducks and a string to teach it to flutter walker.

25
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:15,629
Speaker 0: Now I'm just thinking about the next key CD where they make the circle of ducks.

26
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:16,452
Speaker 1: Yep.

27
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:18,096
Speaker 0: But anyway, I digress.

28
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:21,066
Speaker 0: so we were in Manhattan over the weekend.

29
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:23,194
Speaker 1: It's not that far having a party.

30
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:24,680
Speaker 1: I'm in Manhattan almost every weekend.

31
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:29,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we're having a party in Central Park kind of a picnic because it was not a party.

32
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:30,325
Speaker 0: It was a party picnic.

33
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:31,047
Speaker 1: Sure.

34
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,307
Speaker 0: Well, you wouldn't call that a party bunch of friends hanging out drinking wine Playing the hive with random kids.

35
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:38,491
Speaker 1: It's not a party.

36
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:39,394
Speaker 0: What's a party?

37
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:41,020
Speaker 1: It has to have partying.

38
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:47,500
Speaker 0: So standing around listening to that one really lame song or a cake or cake a cake would would work.

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,563
Speaker 0: Well, you had strawberries.

40
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:49,306
Speaker 1: It's not a.

41
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:53,500
Speaker 0: and we had some cake pastries from a Korean deli.

42
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:56,053
Speaker 1: Those aren't working our Korean Baker.

43
00:01:56,074 --> 00:02:04,625
Speaker 0: They were not cakes anyway, but we're there hanging out and I'm climbing rocks and we're doing all this stuff and then Words start appearing in the sky.

44
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:06,692
Speaker 0: first we appeared.

45
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:13,448
Speaker 0: Oh, oh you I as we that Yes, and then a bunch of other stuff.

46
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:19,812
Speaker 1: and it's amazing because in New York pretty much Well, I think before that we only noticed when the we appeared.

47
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:23,204
Speaker 1: but when we looked up at the we there was an ST Over to the side.

48
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:24,268
Speaker 1: So it was like st.

49
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:25,372
Speaker 0: We street.

50
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:27,239
Speaker 1: we stewie st.

51
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:29,346
Speaker 1: Louis Maybe Ellen the answer coming in.

52
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:39,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it was weird because in New York people don't react to things Usually like a gun could go off and most people just keep walking because they got somewhere to be Fire trucks going by.

53
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:41,737
Speaker 0: there's some jackass jaywalking in front of it.

54
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:47,035
Speaker 0: Yep But yet in Central Park, there were thousands of people just looking up at the sky.

55
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:47,958
Speaker 0: because what's that?

56
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:48,600
Speaker 0: What's it say?

57
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:49,266
Speaker 0: I don't know.

58
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:49,750
Speaker 1: Well, they weren't.

59
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,820
Speaker 1: you know, we're hanging out in the park.

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,893
Speaker 1: It's not like you're doing anything or in a rush to go anywhere.

61
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:54,019
Speaker 1: You're just laying down in the grass.

62
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,151
Speaker 1: You look up in the sky writing.

63
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:57,659
Speaker 1: it's like oh I wonder what that's gonna say.

64
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:01,734
Speaker 0: So, uh, we kept trying to watch it for a while and a bunch of words appeared.

65
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:03,440
Speaker 0: It didn't really make any sense.

66
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think at the end it like said st.

67
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:08,776
Speaker 1: We lease or our lease.

68
00:03:08,997 --> 00:03:13,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Today I went on Google and I was like art Google News.

69
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,440
Speaker 0: Tell me what I was up with sky writing over.

70
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:20,895
Speaker 1: How come they allow sky writing over Manhattan when that isn't that fake like coming after that?

71
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:22,180
Speaker 1: Maybe they got a permit.

72
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:25,009
Speaker 0: Maybe I figured out what happens an easy permit again.

73
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:25,752
Speaker 0: I don't know.

74
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,859
Speaker 0: I want to draw eight equals equals equals D?

75
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:33,098
Speaker 0: Sure, so I go to Google News right and I type sky writing.

76
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:33,580
Speaker 0: Manhattan.

77
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:34,322
Speaker 0: You know what?

78
00:03:34,342 --> 00:03:37,974
Speaker 0: The first headline is what jittery New Yorkers fear.

79
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:39,800
Speaker 0: sky writing terrorists, right?

80
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,769
Speaker 0: Next one sky writing in New York causes confusion.

81
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,940
Speaker 0: every article about the sky writing makes a mention of 9/11.

82
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,680
Speaker 1: I'm sure that the sky writer was, you know going to drop bombs from his tiny sky writing play.

83
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,588
Speaker 0: Well, apparently he wrote many messages.

84
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:57,080
Speaker 0: One of them was lost our lease.

85
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:11,426
Speaker 0: One of them was now open one of them was last chance and supposedly people who saw the last chance one Got scared.

86
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:17,748
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, but it bothers me that every single article about who is now open Who lost their lease and it's the last.

87
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:18,571
Speaker 1: I'll get to that.

88
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:24,380
Speaker 0: but the fact that every article about this thing Brought up 9/11 as though they're in any way related.

89
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:31,100
Speaker 0: But at the same time I didn't see any citations of actual people bringing it up.

90
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:32,932
Speaker 0: It was news people saying.

91
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:35,647
Speaker 0: some people Reminded of 9/11.

92
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:38,600
Speaker 0: some people were afraid that it was a warning some people.

93
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:41,452
Speaker 1: I don't think there were any actual people who thought.

94
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:42,798
Speaker 0: I think it was just.

95
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:51,643
Speaker 0: you know Some people is code in the news for I made some shit up or my personal opinion is Up up.

96
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:52,486
Speaker 0: No, god damn it.

97
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:53,088
Speaker 0: Here's a person.

98
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,359
Speaker 0: Oh, I was genuinely gonna be.

99
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,872
Speaker 1: yeah There's always gonna be said Morgan 29 an Upper West Side actress.

100
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

101
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:02,637
Speaker 0: Okay.

102
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:03,800
Speaker 0: I was really concerned.

103
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,505
Speaker 0: There was some sort of terrorist attack.

104
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,568
Speaker 0: It's so creepy.

105
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,132
Speaker 1: Sure, whatever.

106
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:09,356
Speaker 0: So anyway, you know what this was.

107
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:10,760
Speaker 0: what art project?

108
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:20,449
Speaker 0: Nice they were writing lines from billboards that were in some way evocative of or Related to the economic problems.

109
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:21,433
Speaker 0: We're facing right now.

110
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:28,900
Speaker 0: Nice lost our lease Mm-hmm, and then the last message was now open saying you know what will eventually open back up.

111
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,424
Speaker 0: Everything will be okay in the long run.

112
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:31,126
Speaker 1: Sure.

113
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:35,398
Speaker 0: So it was just a kind of lame art projects and there.

114
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,488
Speaker 1: but you're allowed to do I guess dude, how much does it cost?

115
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:39,211
Speaker 1: I don't know.

116
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:41,700
Speaker 1: We should write something actual like what?

117
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,493
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, we got a point out.

118
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:49,460
Speaker 0: one thing Yeah, we could not read lost our lease due to how quickly the letters dissipate.

119
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,246
Speaker 1: But that's what I'm saying.

120
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,410
Speaker 0: He's got away for the exact right weather You know and you got to have a very succinct message.

121
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,297
Speaker 0: like eight equals equals D.

122
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:59,517
Speaker 1: Exactly I think our message should be front row crew comm.

123
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:05,918
Speaker 0: maybe a Good message about just hash ponies.

124
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:08,782
Speaker 1: How about.

125
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:14,440
Speaker 1: they draw a rainbow - an outline of rainbow - or just they draw a cloud with lightning coming out of it.

126
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,118
Speaker 1: I would actually like to say they can do the colored smoke the Jets do it.

127
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:26,560
Speaker 0: The thing is this sort of art like is a neat art project But I don't know that I don't feel like it's really that original are like.

128
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:27,884
Speaker 0: The idea is cool.

129
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:33,905
Speaker 0: taking these slogans that are related to the economic crisis in some way gathered in some artsy way But why sky?

130
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:36,174
Speaker 0: write them like that was kind of just.

131
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:41,295
Speaker 0: that was like the equivalent of going to the gallery Cuz if you put your art and jelly surrounded by broken glass.

132
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:45,059
Speaker 1: if you put your art in a gallery 10 hipsters will come see if you put it in the sky.

133
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,198
Speaker 0: About how they didn't understand it.

134
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's better than not seeing it at all.

135
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:57,117
Speaker 0: I doubt that the majority of people will ever know it was an art project because you didn't even think To look it up.

136
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:06,185
Speaker 1: I did think to look it up But then I just didn't before I forgot and stop caring and you know what now now that I know I still don't care.

137
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:06,887
Speaker 0: see now.

138
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,214
Speaker 0: It would be a better art project if I drew.

139
00:07:09,315 --> 00:07:10,820
Speaker 0: say the word fuck.

140
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:11,884
Speaker 1: Fuck.

141
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:22,375
Speaker 1: yeah, because then for speech And it would really it would definitely get more attention in the right kind of way I can imagine because the F you see would be up there and everyone in the street.

142
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,360
Speaker 0: We think in the same thing.

143
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,891
Speaker 0: They're not actually writing fuck, but I hope they write fuck.

144
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:28,636
Speaker 0: I should hire actually fuck.

145
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:29,960
Speaker 0: people would lose their shit.

146
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:33,656

00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:53,119
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

156
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:05,320
Speaker 0: So in the news you all know that Netflix decided to launch Possibly the most stupidly named company the world has ever seen regardless of the dumb name, right?

157
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,176
Speaker 1: I don't believe that dumb names are harmful in the long run.

158
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:08,739
Speaker 1: look at the Wii.

159
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:14,360
Speaker 0: okay, the Wii wasn't that dumb of a name because whatever because it got people talking.

160
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:18,191
Speaker 0: Nobody I mean remember when they announced the name of the console.

161
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:20,380
Speaker 0: nobody would shut up about that for like a month.

162
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,740
Speaker 1: And now people don't even think about it?

163
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the we made so much money that they except they're coming out with a blue we now and Sonic is on the box.

164
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:30,060
Speaker 1: All I gotta say is if you're we got a blue.

165
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,130
Speaker 0: Anyway, we would not even be talking about the we.

166
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:43,835
Speaker 0: now my Wii is red, but at least that's mine's Flesh colored sure slightly red if I overuse it.

167
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:52,960
Speaker 0: mine's very anyway But seriously quickster Who?

168
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:55,609
Speaker 0: no human could think that was a good idea.

169
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:57,435
Speaker 0: That's the kind of name that you use.

170
00:08:57,536 --> 00:09:07,794
Speaker 1: if they would up in 1991 if they were going to whatever if they would have just gone through with it people would have forgotten about the name thing and like You know a few months the big problem was they by.

171
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:12,600
Speaker 1: if they had gone through with it They would have split Netflix into two and people just want less thing.

172
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,647
Speaker 0: I was got the same way.

173
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,419
Speaker 1: you want less boxes under your TV.

174
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,860
Speaker 1: You want less bills less accounts with less different less companies?

175
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,662
Speaker 0: He's got.

176
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:27,972
Speaker 0: my point is that naming it quickster means that even the people who want the DVD would Probably not remember the name quickster because they would.

177
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:30,360
Speaker 0: they would think oh, that's some old pirating thing.

178
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,257
Speaker 1: No, there would be links to it from netflix.com.

179
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:34,807
Speaker 1: Like hey still want DVDs?

180
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:35,228
Speaker 1: click here.

181
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:37,780
Speaker 1: Anyway, the thing is a lot of people got confused.

182
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,929
Speaker 1: They thought there were two things that Netflix did.

183
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:42,941
Speaker 1: they did a price hike and then a little while after that They did.

184
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:44,568
Speaker 1: they were they were gonna do the split.

185
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,280
Speaker 1: so people thought that the price hike and the split were the same thing.

186
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,800
Speaker 1: That's not true.

187
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:52,811
Speaker 1: the price hike Was announced before the split was announced and the price hike isn't going anywhere.

188
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:55,920
Speaker 1: and the split was actually gonna keep the same price.

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,560
Speaker 1: It's just gonna give you two separate bills from two separate companies.

190
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:02,440
Speaker 1: That would have added up to be the same price as what you're gonna pay now anyway.

191
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,340
Speaker 0: Well, I guess my point is that the fact that they named it quickster.

192
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,055
Speaker 1: I just I think that you're obsessed with his name and I'm pretty sure it's the worst name.

193
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,160
Speaker 1: names don't matter.

194
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,926
Speaker 1: People have changed names of things.

195
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,251
Speaker 1: Phoenix changed to fire.

196
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:15,680
Speaker 1: bird would change the Firefox names.

197
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:18,618
Speaker 1: Everyone goes crazy when names are stupid or change.

198
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,624
Speaker 1: It'll never met anything.

199
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:25,839
Speaker 1: but you're one example of a stupid name or name change that caused the company any problem whatsoever.

200
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:27,727
Speaker 0: Zima No one drank Zima.

201
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:34,094
Speaker 1: No one drank Zima not because of the name It wasn't and it wasn't a name change or anything.

202
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:34,636
Speaker 1: It was a new name.

203
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,660
Speaker 0: This wasn't a name change.

204
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:39,185
Speaker 0: This was a new company called Napster whatever.

205
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,360
Speaker 1: people just didn't like quickster because they didn't want to have two separate fucking accounts.

206
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:44,411
Speaker 1: They wanted to keep this the one to keep it simple.

207
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:46,100
Speaker 0: and most people don't even want the DVDs.

208
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,103
Speaker 0: They just want streaming.

209
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:52,160
Speaker 0: but the majority of things you want to watch are not in the streaming because that's why I keep one DVD.

210
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:56,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is and as soon as I finish IMDb top 250, I'm probably gonna cancel the whole thing.

211
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:02,620
Speaker 0: Well, I remember let's go back because something similar happened a long time ago when Netflix dropped the multiple cues per account.

212
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,327
Speaker 1: Did they bring that back or not?

213
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:06,919
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they brought it back, but I'm pretty sure they didn't.

214
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:09,014
Speaker 0: I'll bet you ten bucks that they did.

215
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:13,672
Speaker 1: Let me go look I'm gonna sign into my Netflix now because so here's the deal.

216
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:21,980
Speaker 0: back then they said, you know what one day You can't have multiple cues in your account anymore, which really we talked about this on geek nights.

217
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:31,354
Speaker 0: It really messed a lot of people like me up because I have a cue for like TV shows that are serial We're like, I don't want two DVDs of this show at the same time.

218
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,000
Speaker 0: I want to send back the DVD.

219
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,378
Speaker 0: I just finished and get the next DVD of a show.

220
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,990
Speaker 0: Independent of that I want all my movies in another queue.

221
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,765
Speaker 0: that way if I watch a movie and I send it back I get another movie.

222
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,059
Speaker 0: I don't get the next DVD of the show that I don't need.

223
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:48,609
Speaker 0: Yeah and they got rid of that and I said far if you have

224
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:56,920
Speaker 1: five people in your house and you're crazy and you pay for Five discs you want to have one account with one bill and you want to get five separate discs and five separate cues

225
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,085
Speaker 0: Yep, or you've got kids.

226
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:01,559
Speaker 0: you give them one DVD and their own cue so you don't have to deal with it.

227
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:07,920
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm logged into my Netflix and I had it says your cue and I can't find any way to get another cue.

228
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:10,272
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they announced that they were bringing it back.

229
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:14,415
Speaker 0: I Don't see anyway, I will try to look it up but regardless.

230
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:18,174
Speaker 0: so what happened was They they did this and I said fuck you.

231
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:19,059
Speaker 0: and I went down to one DVD.

232
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,485
Speaker 0: I'm like if I can't have multiple cues I only need one DVD.

233
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:26,706
Speaker 0: and then I realized that even if I could have cues back Which I don't know if I ever did get it back.

234
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,572
Speaker 0: and here's why there's confusion on that point.

235
00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:30,659
Speaker 0: I only needed one DVD.

236
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:33,820
Speaker 0: I didn't watch enough Netflix for it to matter.

237
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:41,060
Speaker 1: Okay, so they didn't add multiple cues, but I can add profiles same thing which mean but it's like a whole separate account.

238
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,512
Speaker 0: But Scott it was always that way and those separate accounts can't watch instantly.

239
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was always that way.

240
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:51,076
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Only there was no instantly back then anyway, maybe there was but it sucked.

241
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:57,460
Speaker 0: but Yeah, the DVD The whole DVD rental online model needs to go away.

242
00:12:57,581 --> 00:13:01,160
Speaker 0: It's pointless to have the ability to rent DVDs in this fashion to the modern era.

243
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,943
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

244
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:02,986
Speaker 0: No, it's.

245
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:06,900
Speaker 0: the only reason it's not pointless is because not everything is available for stream.

246
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,419
Speaker 1: Well, that's yeah.

247
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:08,906
Speaker 1: Everything was on the fucking stream.

248
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:12,540
Speaker 0: pointless in the high-level sense because there's no reason.

249
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:16,155
Speaker 0: Anything that is available on DVD can't be available for streaming.

250
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:20,091
Speaker 0: and you can't tell me That's because it takes too much space because space is infinite.

251
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:22,400
Speaker 0: and you can't tell me it's cuz it'll take too much bandwidth.

252
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,685
Speaker 1: It's just because the content is.

253
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:25,031
Speaker 1: they're trying to do it legally.

254
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:29,444
Speaker 1: someone should just start an illegal Netflix Just the way crunchyroll was illegal Originally.

255
00:13:29,745 --> 00:13:34,626
Speaker 1: just put every fucking movie on there and just be like, yeah What what what?

256
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,010
Speaker 0: where are you gonna host this?

257
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:38,318
Speaker 1: some other country what country?

258
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:38,960
Speaker 0: Somalia?

259
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,904
Speaker 1: Fucking I don't know pirate Bay.

260
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:44,313
Speaker 0: All right, you're gonna get enough bandwidth for millions of people.

261
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:45,456
Speaker 1: It's in Sweden's.

262
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:46,700
Speaker 1: actually there's plenty of.

263
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:56,190
Speaker 0: but the problem is that the people who own the copyrights to things basically refuse to play ball with the modern media world.

264
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:02,519
Speaker 1: and I don't still don't know why a big smart tech company doesn't just buy all the fucking movies.

265
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,339
Speaker 1: Straight up movies might be a little it's like but look at it's like Netflix.

266
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:07,504
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like.

267
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:12,140
Speaker 1: Netflix is like buying the rights to movies to put them streaming, you know, it's making deals.

268
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,415
Speaker 1: It's like don't make a deal just buy their entire fucking collection.

269
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:15,816
Speaker 1: Right?

270
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:22,278
Speaker 1: It's like if I it's Remember how I asked the wedding photographer at Scott's wedding about.

271
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:31,114
Speaker 1: you know He basically lied to me because if you go to his website to look at the photos They all these watermarks on and he has a JavaScript to prevent you from context clicking.

272
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:33,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he told me differently.

273
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:36,479
Speaker 1: He said yeah, you can do whatever you want with him as long as you're not like selling merchants, you know.

274
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:37,907
Speaker 1: But he was lying.

275
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:39,796
Speaker 0: Oh, of course wedding photographers always lie.

276
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:42,580
Speaker 0: I could have told his coach Oh that I didn't believe that guy for a second.

277
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:44,306
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was very skeptical.

278
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:48,479
Speaker 1: But anyway, but I asked him and at least he answered me instead of just copping out.

279
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:58,080
Speaker 1: but yeah, but The point is it's like if I'm gonna pay a photographer to photograph an event at some point, right?

280
00:14:58,681 --> 00:14:59,747
Speaker 1: I'm gonna just buy.

281
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:00,913
Speaker 1: you know, I'm not gonna be like.

282
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,120
Speaker 1: I will buy the prints from you.

283
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,720
Speaker 1: It's like no you're gonna give me the copyright to all the photos in writing, you know.

284
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,562
Speaker 1: So it's like Netflix.

285
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:09,089
Speaker 1: don't pay people to let you stream movies.

286
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:12,459
Speaker 1: buy the copyrights to all the goddamn movies.

287
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:19,145
Speaker 0: either They're not for sale The company just won't sell it to you or they ask too much money you if it's a public company It's for sale.

288
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,616
Speaker 1: No, that's what public means for sale.

289
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you have enough money to just buy it out.

290
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,854
Speaker 1: Netflix was $300 a share before they fucked up even then.

291
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,440
Speaker 0: that doesn't mean they have that much cash.

292
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:33,613
Speaker 0: Well, I don't think you know how stock works.

293
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:36,006
Speaker 1: I'm just saying Google maybe could do.

294
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:37,150
Speaker 1: you don't have to buy all the movies.

295
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:43,740
Speaker 1: you just buy some movies and you start with some and you Can you make enough money off of the fact that people don't pay you extra?

296
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:45,420
Speaker 0: In fact, they have all their subscribers.

297
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:53,440
Speaker 0: Anyway, all they have to do their business model from a game theory perspective is to not lose subscribers and to gain more subscribers.

298
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:59,883
Speaker 0: Independent of what content they offer they have no incentive to add content unless it will add Thing.

299
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:03,474
Speaker 1: that's the number one reason that subscribers leave is because the contents.

300
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:04,277
Speaker 0: do they leave?

301
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,300
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone leaves.

302
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:05,990
Speaker 0: People have left.

303
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:12,771
Speaker 1: I don't think enough people have left to be even left because they watch all the good movies and stuff and then they don't have The newer seasons of the TV show.

304
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,739
Speaker 1: so they start pirating again.

305
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:16,225
Speaker 1: Day, they came out.

306
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:17,309
Speaker 0: people it's got it Scott.

307
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:18,914
Speaker 0: Do you have any numbers to back that up?

308
00:16:18,974 --> 00:16:20,620
Speaker 1: No, that's what everyone's people say.

309
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,911
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what people say the opposite that everyone just keeps their account.

310
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:25,738
Speaker 1: Netflix's subscriber numbers did go down.

311
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:26,259
Speaker 1: I read a thing.

312
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:28,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is they go.

313
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,459
Speaker 0: they went down during the profile business back in the day, too.

314
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,955
Speaker 0: They any company's subscriptions go down anytime anything changes.

315
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:36,846
Speaker 1: Mmm Anyway, we've got a lot too.

316
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:37,770
Speaker 1: Well too long about this.

317
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they basically capitulated and said alright, we'll have DVDs.

318
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:45,693
Speaker 0: I think you should be legally justified if you own a DVD of some media.

319
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:47,759
Speaker 0: I'm free to lend it to someone, right?

320
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,341
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

321
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:57,380
Speaker 0: I should be free in my opinion to Transfer that to a digital form or have a fucking drive with the DVD in it.

322
00:16:57,862 --> 00:17:00,379
Speaker 0: And if anyone wants to borrow it I can lend it to them.

323
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:05,196
Speaker 0: But I can only lend it to one person at a time or end people based on the number of DVDs.

324
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:08,930
Speaker 0: Mmm I believe that Netflix should be able to.

325
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:18,848
Speaker 0: if they own, you know, a hundred DVDs of some movie independent of what the guy who made the movie or the guy who owns the copyright of the movie wants they should be able to Let up to a hundred people stream that movie at the same time.

326
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:19,671
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

327
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,140
Speaker 0: Well probably lawsuits and bullshit.

328
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,353
Speaker 1: Well, no, there was a similar thing where Cablevision wanted to.

329
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:35,422
Speaker 1: instead of giving people DVRs They wanted to have one DVR that were recorded all the shows at the Cablevision headquarters and then to stream the show to you when you wanted to watch On-demand.

330
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:36,767
Speaker 0: I think that should be fine.

331
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:40,620
Speaker 1: And I think they won when they tried to get that one over.

332
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,827
Speaker 0: I don't know because you brought that one up.

333
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,520
Speaker 1: The onus is on you anyway onus, but I don't think they did it.

334
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,183
Speaker 1: It's onus Charles.

335
00:17:47,223 --> 00:17:49,214
Speaker 1: Something weird happened, but they should have.

336
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:51,224
Speaker 1: they should have just done it No matter what the court said.

337
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:51,967
Speaker 1: people have no balls.

338
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:58,110
Speaker 1: So anyway, anyway, I guess we should say something about Steve Jobs Even though it said the internet has said too much.

339
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,595
Speaker 1: Well, I mean a person died.

340
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:00,700
Speaker 1: It is sad.

341
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:03,200
Speaker 1: He changed the world in many ways.

342
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:09,260
Speaker 0: He was also bad in many ways, but he was like good in more ways than he was bad like all people's.

343
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:13,959
Speaker 1: Are there any people's who are all bad or all good?

344
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,563
Speaker 0: Maybe Hitler?

345
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,394
Speaker 1: he made paintings which were apparently they weren't that good.

346
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:21,160
Speaker 1: They weren't good, but they didn't hurt anybody.

347
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:21,983
Speaker 0: How do you know?

348
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:24,110
Speaker 0: maybe they were so bad that they drove him crazy.

349
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,980
Speaker 1: They couldn't have been as bad as like fanfiction paintings.

350
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:30,870
Speaker 1: You see They weren't for repainting saucy ones, maybe right.

351
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:39,194
Speaker 1: there weren't saucy furry paintings, maybe they were Yeah, and I guess when he was a baby he wasn't bad right did?

352
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:40,880
Speaker 1: maybe he cried a lot and everyone hated him.

353
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,284
Speaker 0: Maybe he might have been horrible.

354
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:42,706
Speaker 0: We don't know.

355
00:18:43,187 --> 00:18:47,080
Speaker 1: a lot of babies are horrible and there's nobody who's all good not even like Gandhi.

356
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:50,573
Speaker 1: Well, especially not Gandhi, but you know Steve Jobs.

357
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:54,260
Speaker 1: It was even Steve Jobs If he would have not had fake medicine.

358
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:59,464
Speaker 0: Thing is Apple will probably be fine probably in fact.

359
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:03,559
Speaker 0: if anything I have a feeling that the culture he instilled will live on.

360
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,619
Speaker 0: but The company might open up a little bit.

361
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:07,724
Speaker 1: I hope it opens up.

362
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:18,298
Speaker 1: the only major change I've seen so far since and it happened before he died But after he left the company was they started doing a charity thing to where like Apple employees can have their paychecks.

363
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:18,940
Speaker 1: go to charity.

364
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:20,066
Speaker 1: You know Porsche whatever.

365
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:22,259
Speaker 0: every big company does that Apple didn't do it.

366
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:25,431
Speaker 0: That that's kind of sad Steve Jobs was it?

367
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:27,699
Speaker 1: people are you know, people don't know cuz.

368
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:32,160
Speaker 1: you know Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are very open with the charity like give all the fucking money away bitches.

369
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:38,658
Speaker 1: Steve Jobs was either of like the Jewish mentality where you give but you don't tell anyone that you gave cuz.

370
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:39,200
Speaker 1: that would be.

371
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:39,943
Speaker 1: You know cuz.

372
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:40,184
Speaker 1: it's like.

373
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:40,989
Speaker 1: it's not charity.

374
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:44,465
Speaker 1: if you're letting everyone know cuz then you're like I'm so charitable and great.

375
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:45,188
Speaker 1: look at my Scott.

376
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,040
Speaker 0: if good is done for a bad reason good is still done.

377
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:50,700
Speaker 1: Yes, of course, but I'm just saying is it you know?

378
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,744
Speaker 1: Is it it's?

379
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:55,880
Speaker 1: if your motives are not pure if you're gloating about the goodness that you do.

380
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,390
Speaker 0: I'd argue that no one's motives are pure because dopamine of course not.

381
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:10,216
Speaker 1: but the point is is that there are these people aren't sure if either he did he was very giving but kept it anonymous or Was he just really not fucking giving?

382
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:13,859
Speaker 0: well There is no problem with having the company that does this sort of thing.

383
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,080
Speaker 0: People feel pressured to donate some amount of their paycheck.

384
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the company matches though.

385
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:25,045
Speaker 1: So why you know, you could just have it donate to something That's gonna go to you.

386
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:27,135
Speaker 1: For example a good strategy a CLU.

387
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:34,600
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but I mean give to a charity that is a scholarship that might be won by one of your kids.

388
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:36,404
Speaker 0: You know what?

389
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:36,927
Speaker 0: I'll give to.

390
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:42,503
Speaker 0: yeah the human fund human fund Best fund All right.

391
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:43,307
Speaker 1: All right.

392
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:49,810
Speaker 1: So the Steve Jobs, we just said it because I guess obligatory Nothing, I'm going to say now will not have already met.

393
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,575
Speaker 1: the whole internet already said whatever.

394
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:55,045
Speaker 1: Okay, so Google It was recently they were.

395
00:20:55,146 --> 00:21:03,829
Speaker 1: there was some rumblings that they were come up with a new language not go which they already came out With but another one stop called dart And now they actually came out with it.

396
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:05,900
Speaker 1: You can go to dart Lang org to read about it.

397
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:08,179
Speaker 1: Basically, they're trying to replace JavaScript which is.

398
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:16,300
Speaker 1: But of course they you know, they can get it put into Chrome which is rapidly gaining share which is helpful.

399
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:26,601
Speaker 1: but how are you gonna get anyone to write their website in Dart unless Safari and Firefox and IE all support it and that's gonna take at least you know I use.

400
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:32,440
Speaker 1: probably if they're gonna add it aren't gonna add it into like I 11 or 12 right and Firefox probably won't add it.

401
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,305
Speaker 1: You know, it's like so.

402
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:39,078
Speaker 1: good luck with that, but it can compile down to JavaScript sort of like coffee script.

403
00:21:39,158 --> 00:21:39,820
Speaker 1: So who knows?

404
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:41,703
Speaker 1: But it's actually.

405
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:42,866
Speaker 1: it's a pretty interesting language.

406
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:47,660
Speaker 1: Like it sort of looks like Java, but it can be strictly typed or not typed.

407
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:48,349
Speaker 1: It's sort of.

408
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:53,735
Speaker 1: it's sort of weird But I don't actually know much about it as long as it's better than JavaScript.

409
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:54,418
Speaker 1: I'll be happy.

410
00:21:54,458 --> 00:22:03,920
Speaker 1: right now It's just sort of in development But it's object oriented as opposed to the functional JavaScript which is good for a lot of people who mostly understand object-oriented programming.

411
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:13,006
Speaker 1: it's got a little bit that jQuery ness where you use, you know, the CSS selectors to grab objects from the from the DOM and It's got interfaces.

412
00:22:13,086 --> 00:22:15,496
Speaker 1: So just like in Java where you implement interfaces.

413
00:22:15,757 --> 00:22:16,400
Speaker 1: That's how this works.

414
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,452
Speaker 1: You just implement interfaces all over the fuck.

415
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:19,036
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

416
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:21,089
Speaker 1: So We'll see how this goes.

417
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,659
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try it out.

418
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:25,791
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm interested but actually I write very little code.

419
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:27,316
Speaker 1: these just cuz I hate JavaScript.

420
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:28,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, and who doesn't?

421
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:32,532
Speaker 0: People who only know JavaScript, but they probably hate it.

422
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:34,259
Speaker 1: Anyway, you probably you know, you should.

423
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,660
Speaker 0: So very briefly Amazon there's this whole problem with sales tax and every state has its own rules.

424
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:49,620
Speaker 0: It's really hard to follow all of them and whether or not you have to pay sales tax and the fact that all of you Out there probably owe and do not pay fully your use taxes.

425
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:53,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, like in New York if I buy a car like when I moved to New York from Michigan.

426
00:22:54,021 --> 00:23:03,559
Speaker 0: I had a car I had to prove to New York State that I paid sales tax on it And then I had to pay a use tax because I bought it out of state and brought it into New York.

427
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:17,399
Speaker 0: but all that aside Tennessee is working with Amazon and There's an idea coming out of this that I think is really interesting that I think won't happen Even though I think it really needs to happen.

428
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:25,019
Speaker 0: I don't think we state should have any right to tax internet sales And I think there should be a separate federal internet sales tax.

429
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,610
Speaker 1: Well, of course, I mean this is something I haven't understood for the longest time.

430
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,205
Speaker 1: is you know states trying to regulate the internet in Any way whatsoever.

431
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:35,940
Speaker 0: It's got because states regulate commerce internally.

432
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:44,200
Speaker 0: So if I for me, for example, I have to form it in a state and it's true that states laws So what they say is you form this company in New York.

433
00:23:44,702 --> 00:23:48,960
Speaker 0: You got to follow all New York's rules, which includes collecting sales tax for New York, right?

434
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,640
Speaker 1: But the point is is that you know, the company is a New York company.

435
00:23:53,021 --> 00:23:56,454
Speaker 1: I am physically in New York, but the business we are conducting is on the internet.

436
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,224
Speaker 0: There is a. well now you could argue Where's the server?

437
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:00,550
Speaker 1: It does so fine.

438
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,137
Speaker 1: is the server in the same fucking state?

439
00:24:02,237 --> 00:24:02,780
Speaker 0: It's in New York.

440
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,816
Speaker 1: Is there any traffic routed to any other state whatsoever or any other country as any part of that transaction?

441
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:10,320
Speaker 0: Scott if I buy?

442
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,534
Speaker 0: Something in New York drive out of New York turn around drive back in.

443
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:15,899
Speaker 0: that does not change the status.

444
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:17,503
Speaker 1: It should.

445
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:18,125
Speaker 1: why?

446
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:19,670
Speaker 1: because the internet is not.

447
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:21,054
Speaker 1: it is like big.

448
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:22,820
Speaker 1: the internet is bigger than the United States.

449
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:34,420
Speaker 1: It should actually count as like international commerce, even if I buy something from Amazon and they're a US company and I'm in the US regardless, I There's this whole deal Amazon's making with Tennessee, but it's not that interesting.

450
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:41,460
Speaker 0: But I really honestly think that no state should be allowed to collect any sales tax on any online transaction.

451
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:57,400
Speaker 0: We should have a federal tax and at best all the taxes that go to the Fed for that You know 5% 6% whatever should be allocated back to the states based on I don't know The Fed could just calculate it based on whatever state gave the most in gets the most out or something.

452
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,746
Speaker 1: So I mean think about this.

453
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:05,249
Speaker 1: right even though there are radio towers within states Right that might be broadcasting from a state to the same state.

454
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,980
Speaker 1: the FCC regulates that shit because the airwaves is federal territory.

455
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:10,866
Speaker 1: So are the phone lines.

456
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:12,552
Speaker 1: so should be the internet.

457
00:25:12,592 --> 00:25:23,823
Speaker 0: well most of the laws from what I can gather I'm not a lawyer related to sales tax on the internet are the laws that were used to regulate mail-order catalogs and Catalog.

458
00:25:23,884 --> 00:25:25,150
Speaker 1: that is pretty similar.

459
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:32,820
Speaker 0: It is actually but The scale of commerce is on such a difference, but the thing is even mail-order catalogs, right?

460
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,320
Speaker 1: You're using the mail, which is a federal thing.

461
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,002
Speaker 1: Therefore my.

462
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:43,120
Speaker 1: even I'm sort of doing interstate commerce because my mail is entering the post office, which is federal territory.

463
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:49,040
Speaker 1: So the mail goes into federal territory, which is not a state in itself, but is no state.

464
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:54,842
Speaker 1: So it goes to no state and then comes back to same state that it left from but it still left the state and came Back in.

465
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:56,249
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that doesn't matter.

466
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:58,942
Speaker 1: I know obviously it doesn't matter But you know what?

467
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:01,110
Speaker 1: I would change that if I could.

468
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:08,060
Speaker 0: I'm just you know, as much as I would love You know my smarter state that I live in now to be able to do its own thing.

469
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:14,100
Speaker 0: I'm kind of sick of states all having their own slightly crooked rules about pointless crap.

470
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,171
Speaker 1: Well, this is the only reason Amazon is complaining.

471
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:18,040
Speaker 1: is they don't actually care about collecting the tag?

472
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:41,070
Speaker 1: No They just care about it so ridiculously complicated for them to actually get all the tax rules right in their system that they would have to have like an army of people and Lawyers constantly updating all these incredibly tiny rules and when you click check out this Ridiculous database would look at would probably be slow as molasses when you click check out to look up and calculate The exact right sales tax that you have to pay right.

473
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:44,200
Speaker 1: so they're not over or under charging anyone that you know.

474
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,775
Speaker 1: And they got to go by your address and where you are and it would.

475
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:50,820
Speaker 1: it wouldn't be exact 100% precise because they don't even the data for that right?

476
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,739
Speaker 1: It's like you put in your address, so they try to find you on the map But if the map slightly off you might be in a different tax zone.

477
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,684
Speaker 0: now You can argue.

478
00:26:57,905 --> 00:26:59,454
Speaker 0: you can argue Scott that Amazon is big enough.

479
00:26:59,514 --> 00:27:00,419
Speaker 0: They should have to you know.

480
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:02,206
Speaker 0: Come to possible.

481
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:03,493
Speaker 0: no, it's not impossible.

482
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:04,680
Speaker 0: It's really expensive companies.

483
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,283
Speaker 1: it's impossible.

484
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:13,016
Speaker 0: there are databases for stuff like this kind of like what we're gonna talk about a little bit and People can deal with this on a large scale.

485
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:13,660
Speaker 0: It just cost money.

486
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,249
Speaker 0: You could say it's a cost of doing business.

487
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,259
Speaker 0: Just like how if I have a brick factory I have to pay the cost of diff.

488
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:22,694
Speaker 0: You know following all the environmental regulation is you can get it really.

489
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,000
Speaker 1: you can get it very close to right.

490
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,379
Speaker 1: It's impossible to get it 100% right especially on those things like five-day tax holiday in.

491
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:36,796
Speaker 0: But Scott that is a Problem of the fact that our legal system and particularly our tax laws are just 100 200 300 year old cluster Fox.

492
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:48,604
Speaker 0: Yeah, but all that aside you could argue that Amazon should have to bear that cost of operating That cost for Amazon would not be that bad.

493
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:52,869
Speaker 0: the cost for like Joey Jojo selling his Etsy stuff.

494
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,691
Speaker 0: Yeah Impossible.

495
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:55,695
Speaker 0: yeah it would.

496
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:59,950
Speaker 0: regulations like that because they're so Byzantine destroy small businesses.

497
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:05,410
Speaker 1: But even if they could do it, right, where would you even get the data if some databases, right?

498
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,234
Speaker 1: But eat let's say some.

499
00:28:06,274 --> 00:28:08,789
Speaker 1: tiny County has a three-day tax holiday basis.

500
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:15,582
Speaker 1: Even so you're telling me that tiny County with ten farmers in it is gonna update that Database for those ten days.

501
00:28:15,603 --> 00:28:16,470
Speaker 1: They have a tax holiday.

502
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:23,606
Speaker 0: Most of the civilize states do as far as I can tell even for the even A lot of this information, but they're all very expensive.

503
00:28:24,027 --> 00:28:33,658
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway But anyway things of the day.

504
00:28:33,758 --> 00:28:35,719
Speaker 0: So this is a pretty great video.

505
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:36,440
Speaker 0: Scott showed it to me.

506
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:53,815
Speaker 0: it's a couple minutes long like four or five and It's a scientist pointing out that Dopamine levels go up to reward you when you do stuff, but okay that they go up more in Anticipation of Getting rewarded for doing stuff than they do the door.

507
00:28:53,915 --> 00:29:00,140
Speaker 1: actually getting reward It doesn't mean actually comes out before you get the reward while you're while you're anticipating the reward.

508
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:03,892
Speaker 0: So it's I push the button I get a reward.

509
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:04,995
Speaker 0: I push the button.

510
00:29:05,337 --> 00:29:11,314
Speaker 0: I get a little bit of dopamine I get a reward I push the button I get a little more dopamine I get the reward and then it gets the point to where I get.

511
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:22,940
Speaker 1: like the reward is from Anticipating the reward you get the dopamine is squirted into your brain before you push the button Pretty much not after you push the button and then you definitely don't get anything when you get the reward.

512
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:30,340
Speaker 1: right as I can and on top of that right is Let's say there's a button that you push and only half the time you push the button the reward comes out.

513
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,732
Speaker 1: You're not guaranteed to get the reward.

514
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:32,700
Speaker 0: So what do you think is gonna happen?

515
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,984
Speaker 0: Are we gonna have more or less dopamine?

516
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:42,860
Speaker 1: you get a zillion times more dopamine like double and you still get it before you push The button but you get more when there's only a chance of the reward happening.

517
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,823
Speaker 1: So it's like scratch-off.

518
00:29:43,863 --> 00:29:50,337
Speaker 1: lottery tickets give you way more than say lottery tickets are guaranteed to win or candy bars Which you're guaranteed to eat.

519
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,356
Speaker 1: So I'm just gonna make a farm ville which is you know, or half the time you click and nothing.

520
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:56,908
Speaker 1: yeah a game Just like that.

521
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,070
Speaker 1: only sometimes Your farm doesn't get better.

522
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:06,220
Speaker 1: You have to come back every hour You can click again and sometimes when you click your farm gets better and sometimes when you click the front doesn't get better.

523
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:08,232
Speaker 1: It just you know, it won't be a farm.

524
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:12,266
Speaker 0: It'll be something else, you know Could be like that the money tree.

525
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:16,120
Speaker 1: you remember that tree that I clicked on that tree so many times in high school.

526
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:18,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, I went in high school.

527
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,800
Speaker 1: I went during the school day.

528
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:26,425
Speaker 0: I wasn't wasting my time at home, but I went and clicked around for a while and I was like, wait a minute There's no money in here.

529
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:27,509
Speaker 0: No, stop doing it.

530
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:29,055
Speaker 0: What I did have?

531
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:37,539
Speaker 0: I did have a computer 486 that ran this bar on the bottom that showed ads and paid you like a penny an hour And I had a thing that moved the mouse back and forth.

532
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:40,155
Speaker 0: I never got paid though.

533
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:47,260
Speaker 1: So Okay This isn't the greatest but the internet hasn't been that great lately.

534
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:49,169
Speaker 1: In fact your thing of the day I gave to you.

535
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,220
Speaker 1: so I took this one for myself because you didn't want it.

536
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:55,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, my policy is only things of the day that I can show to someone on an HT PC.

537
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,008
Speaker 1: I can show this to someone on HT PC.

538
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:59,520
Speaker 1: It's a YouTube video called pac-man the musical.

539
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,113
Speaker 1: It's just a cute little claymation pac-man with a little song and that's it.

540
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:03,956
Speaker 0: It's okay.

541
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:04,538
Speaker 0: It's pretty cute.

542
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:07,831
Speaker 1: It's okay It's not the greatest but you know internet slow lately.

543
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:09,798
Speaker 0: that was the best thing you've seen in the last 24 hours.

544
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:18,899
Speaker 1: My theory is that all the internet the best people who make the best internet stuff are all occupying Wall Street All the crazy people.

545
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:24,400
Speaker 0: So very briefly in the meta moment the book club book was the ear of the eye of the arm by Nancy farmer.

546
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:26,032
Speaker 1: Did we put that up yet?

547
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,040
Speaker 0: Not yet, but it's done.

548
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:29,067
Speaker 0: the episode will go up whenever I put it up.

549
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:34,366
Speaker 0: and the next book club book the current book club book is You forgot didn't you know?

550
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:35,048
Speaker 0: it's your book.

551
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:35,710
Speaker 0: you get to say it.

552
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:37,094
Speaker 1: What is it then?

553
00:31:37,114 --> 00:31:38,117
Speaker 0: a little prince?

554
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:40,785
Speaker 0: and and What's the other book?

555
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:42,093
Speaker 0: that you're like you the white guy?

556
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:42,616
Speaker 1: so I was right.

557
00:31:42,636 --> 00:31:43,139
Speaker 1: you forgot it.

558
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:44,559
Speaker 0: I forgot the name of the book.

559
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:46,574
Speaker 1: Yeah It's called the wind sand and stars.

560
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:48,345
Speaker 1: By on top.

561
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:51,460
Speaker 1: they saw as you pretty and I'm waiting for a French person to tell me I'm saying his name.

562
00:31:53,503 --> 00:31:56,339
Speaker 0: We will be at the New York comic-con but not doing panels just hanging out.

563
00:31:57,103 --> 00:32:01,440
Speaker 0: If you want to see what panels we would have done come to some other anime con like anime Boston.

564
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:03,669
Speaker 0: Mag fest is shaping up.

565
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:10,337
Speaker 0: We're part of the mag 9 though I think there's more than 9 people now gaming intellectuals and burning apocalypse con 11 11 11.

566
00:32:10,337 --> 00:32:12,165
Speaker 1: Yeah a month from now We will be there.

567
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:13,593
Speaker 0: All right doing stuff.

568
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:14,277
Speaker 1: Yep,

569
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:35,780
Speaker 0: so there are a surprising number of databases or just large collections of factual information that are very very important to the way computers technology the world work and Yet not only do like non-technologists not care about it But most technologists don't care about it or even think about it or know it's a problem.

570
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:43,220
Speaker 1: Well, cuz these are things, you know It's sort of like I was reading today about the problem of the the shrinking kilogram, right?

571
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,363
Speaker 1: I would like it's losing.

572
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:52,610
Speaker 1: it lost like a fraction of weight and how they're trying desperately to get rid of the kilogram and Instead base it on something else and like.

573
00:32:52,630 --> 00:33:05,060
Speaker 1: well kind of like how we made a second be defined by you know Like one guy instead of trying to define a kilogram based on the weight of What's it called like the case something mass of right captain massive?

574
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,236
Speaker 1: What's it called the something K?

575
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,300
Speaker 1: But anyway instead of you basing it on that particular object that's stored in a vault in Paris, right?

576
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,149
Speaker 0: Which I point out we can't actually be basing it on that.

577
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,280
Speaker 0: if we recognize that it is fact it has in fact change.

578
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:22,325
Speaker 1: actually, no we are because there is a Go.

579
00:33:22,386 --> 00:33:26,118
Speaker 1: read about that how it works But they have these other ones next to it and all this stuff.

580
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:29,691
Speaker 1: but One guy is trying to base it on Avogadro's number.

581
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:30,354
Speaker 1: He's paid that.

582
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:31,399
Speaker 1: basically what they're trying to do.

583
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,265
Speaker 1: Do you remember Avogadro's number?

584
00:33:33,526 --> 00:33:33,988
Speaker 0: nine point?

585
00:33:34,048 --> 00:33:37,619
Speaker 1: Oh two times ten to the twenty six close enough, right?

586
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,444
Speaker 1: What they're trying?

587
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:39,900
Speaker 1: but they need it to be a cert.

588
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Speaker 1: They need to basically calculate Avogadro's number to more decimal places than it currently is.

589
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,215
Speaker 1: They need eight decimal places of a hundred percent certainty basically to get it to be.

590
00:33:49,335 --> 00:33:50,038
Speaker 1: have it be good enough?

591
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:50,660
Speaker 0: six point.

592
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:57,380
Speaker 1: So what they're trying to do is they're trying to fashion a sphere of silicon, right?

593
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,925
Speaker 1: That's that's exactly that.

594
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:07,480
Speaker 1: they know exactly how many atoms are in there and then base it on that Because then they'll know aha the mass of nine point oh two times, you know this many, right?

595
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,277
Speaker 0: Six point oh two to another guy's ten to the twenty-third, right?

596
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,703
Speaker 0: Keep saying nine.

597
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:16,052
Speaker 1: I don't know why I say that it is six point.

598
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:16,655
Speaker 1: Oh two days.

599
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:17,920
Speaker 1: Oh, I had the six and whatever.

600
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:20,188
Speaker 1: There's another guy who's training.

601
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,699
Speaker 0: wait wait wait you had the six and what?

602
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:24,099
Speaker 1: Well, I had the six in the wrong place.

603
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:27,054
Speaker 1: Okay, I had a nine that came out of nowhere because you said I had the six.

604
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:28,790
Speaker 0: and well never mind I'm like, what do you mean?

605
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,297
Speaker 0: you had the six?

606
00:34:31,061 --> 00:34:31,523
Speaker 0: Where'd it go?

607
00:34:31,543 --> 00:34:36,527
Speaker 1: Well, I said nine point oh two times ten to the twenty six Even though my brain was thinking maybe it's third.

608
00:34:36,547 --> 00:34:39,340
Speaker 1: Well, then I was like, no, it's six point oh two times ended, right?

609
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:39,723
Speaker 1: I had this.

610
00:34:39,763 --> 00:34:41,038
Speaker 1: I put the six where the three should be.

611
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:52,663
Speaker 0: Because my brain, you know, if you go back in time rim in Like chemistry class when I was at the community college in high school is looking at rim today being what the fuck is wrong with You.

612
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:57,354
Speaker 1: come on, dude right, so one other guy is trying to do it where he's?

613
00:34:57,736 --> 00:35:09,920
Speaker 1: he basically put a kilogram mass on a giant scale in his hat in a building and he's gonna pull down the other end of the scale Right with an electromagnet and then he's gonna figure out exactly.

614
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:21,600
Speaker 1: So precisely how many you know volts or watts or whatever of electricity you have to put into that electromagnet To get the thing to be perfectly balanced and then he can be like aha.

615
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,200
Speaker 1: So a kilogram is the mass that you can pull with exactly this many volts of electricity to met, right?

616
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,940
Speaker 1: So those two guys are trying to figure out, you know a better way of measuring the kilogram.

617
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:39,511
Speaker 0: But anyway now that one's not so relevant to computer technology Is that information right?

618
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:45,900
Speaker 1: that fundamental base of How much is a kilogram right underlies all this science?

619
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,580
Speaker 1: But if you're like a biologist, you know kilograms are important to biologists.

620
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:57,400
Speaker 1: But they're not thinking about the weights and measures all the time In fact, they're probably not thinking about it even on an annual basis unless an article about it shows up, right?

621
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:57,721
Speaker 1: They're just.

622
00:35:57,761 --> 00:36:02,879
Speaker 1: they got the scales in their lab and the scales, you know, they calibrate them and it's a kilogram.

623
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:06,560
Speaker 1: good You know, they're not basing their scales on the real kilogram, right?

624
00:36:06,803 --> 00:36:19,700
Speaker 1: But somewhere along the line deep down the person who made the scale and the person they have a thing that they use to calibrate and that thing was based On something which is eventually was based on the real deal and in the world of computers.

625
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:34,573
Speaker 1: There are a whole bunch of servers out there that are way down at the bottom Just like the real kilogram is way down at the bottom and all of the other computers are based on that sort of like the root 13 DNS servers, you know, you're hardly ever talking to them.

626
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,500
Speaker 1: your computer basically never talks to those servers.

627
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,973
Speaker 0: Well window old Windows computers constantly talk to them, right?

628
00:36:41,094 --> 00:36:42,358
Speaker 1: It's extremely rare.

629
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:47,740
Speaker 1: It is possible You know, it happens once in a while, but it's extremely rare that your computer ever contacts those computers.

630
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:59,060
Speaker 0: Let's zoom back a little bit because you know, you all know how DNS works on some level But you probably don't actually know how like bind works or the difference between a recursive query and all the different ways DNS functions.

631
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:05,660
Speaker 0: And the you know, the the pointer records the in at an ARPA and all that stuff, but think about it on a high level.

632
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:07,571
Speaker 0: Alright, you want to look something up you say?

633
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:09,020
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I go to the comm server.

634
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,067
Speaker 0: How do I know where comm is?

635
00:37:11,388 --> 00:37:13,656
Speaker 0: How do I know what server manages calm?

636
00:37:13,676 --> 00:37:14,378
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm?

637
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,827
Speaker 0: How do I know what server manages net?

638
00:37:17,048 --> 00:37:19,720
Speaker 1: because there's a text file on your computer that says what yep.

639
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,397
Speaker 0: So where's that text file come from?

640
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,726
Speaker 1: Someone wrote it.

641
00:37:22,947 --> 00:37:34,163
Speaker 0: Yep, and by hand yeah, and when you in like when you bootstrap a Linux computer from default and you like like from scratch and you set up like Their base based stuff in your system What are the things you do?

642
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:38,899
Speaker 0: is you get your like seed file for your DNS and it uses that.

643
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:38,999
Speaker 0: well.

644
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,971
Speaker 1: If you install bind it comes with the text file.

645
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:44,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that seed file comes from somewhere.

646
00:37:44,782 --> 00:37:47,415
Speaker 1: Yes, so the guy it's in the bind source code repository.

647
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:47,636
Speaker 1: Yeah.

648
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:57,360
Speaker 1: Yeah but yet so Basically, there's these bunch of servers providing all kinds of services way down at the bottom of all technology.

649
00:37:57,821 --> 00:38:03,919
Speaker 1: Right that you hardly ever talked to or notice but there's often drama around them.

650
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:14,246
Speaker 0: Yep, great There was a point where I think two or three of the root DNS servers got hacked and went down and they were some of them Were in weird countries Where shit can happen?

651
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:15,571
Speaker 0: There's only 13 of them.

652
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:16,756
Speaker 0: There can't be more.

653
00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:17,319
Speaker 1: Yep.

654
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:22,100
Speaker 1: Also, what you'll often have is the typical cloud situation, right?

655
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:29,140
Speaker 1: It's like the cloud is great because if something's in the cloud, it's on the internet You can access it from anywhere but also is a single point of failure.

656
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:35,320
Speaker 1: So it's like they'll be the server that provides some service that everyone needs and then it goes down.

657
00:38:37,443 --> 00:38:39,030
Speaker 0: It went down or never mind.

658
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,320
Speaker 0: look at the fact that you know people think oh the Internet's just a big web.

659
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,950
Speaker 0: It's actually not that web like at all.

660
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,580
Speaker 1: And I mean it could be more web-like.

661
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:49,669
Speaker 1: It you know architecturally could and should be.

662
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,320
Speaker 1: it is not you know, the technological stopping us from doing it.

663
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:59,539
Speaker 1: It's mostly stuff that is you know, I guess Organizational that is stopping us from doing it.

664
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:08,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there are you know, you think you have an ISP but there's ISPs for ISPs and there is drama the likes of which You will never fathom between those ISPs.

665
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:13,613
Speaker 0: Oh god on a regular basis Sometimes you try to go to like part of the like a websites down.

666
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:14,617
Speaker 0: You're like, oh the internet like.

667
00:39:14,637 --> 00:39:21,960
Speaker 0: there's some problem That is sometimes been caused by pissing matches between two chunks of the internet who say we're not gonna route to you anymore.

668
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, think about it.

669
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:22,904
Speaker 1: Right?

670
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,656
Speaker 1: So you get let's say you live somewhere and there's like four ISPs, right?

671
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:39,420
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there might be only one undersea cable between country A and country B. So no matter who your ISP is if the person who runs the servers on the ends of the international underwater cable as a pissing match.

672
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:43,914
Speaker 1: Suddenly the whole internet in that country looks like it's down and you're.

673
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:45,460
Speaker 1: they look like your country is down.

674
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,740
Speaker 1: So you'll try to go to www.co that other country and nothing will come up to any of the sites.

675
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,793
Speaker 1: You're like what's going on here and they'll sit.

676
00:39:52,813 --> 00:39:53,820
Speaker 1: think the same thing about you.

677
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:55,919
Speaker 1: But really it's just a pissing match between two dicks.

678
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,706
Speaker 0: So this has happened yet again.

679
00:39:58,826 --> 00:40:01,133
Speaker 0: There's a new story that has come to light something very.

680
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:03,260
Speaker 1: that's why we thought of doing this episode.

681
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:17,198
Speaker 0: Yep, and I know who the smart techies are the ones who are on not I don't want our level But the ones who think about stuff the way we do because all of them emailed me and said oh my god rim this will piss you off and I'm like one step ahead of you.

682
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:17,720
Speaker 0: home song.

683
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:20,308
Speaker 1: Well, I was the one I said it to you first.

684
00:40:20,328 --> 00:40:27,260
Speaker 0: cuz I'm I actually know I invest in it is the Administrator in my office sent it to me long before you did.

685
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:32,160
Speaker 0: Anyway, I had not read slash shot yet that day, huh?

686
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,463
Speaker 1: So you want to talk about it?

687
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:35,546
Speaker 0: All right, let's talk about it.

688
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:36,911
Speaker 0: So time zones right.

689
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:44,603
Speaker 0: time zones just work and computers I mean, I make a Linux computer and it just has this list of time zones like New York USA.

690
00:40:44,623 --> 00:40:50,367
Speaker 1: yeah, you look at your cell phone and it if you travel somewhere when you get off the plane the time zone just magically Changes.

691
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:51,180
Speaker 1: it knows where it is.

692
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,993
Speaker 1: It knows the difference between wherever you are and whatever time.

693
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:56,999
Speaker 1: it is UTC and it changes the.

694
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:12,925
Speaker 0: oh Okay, just in my Windows computer if I want to pick UTC I have to choose between Monrovia Rick I'm not gonna say that word Dublin Edinburgh Lisbon London CUT or Casablanca or GMT Or GMT even listed.

695
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:16,800
Speaker 1: no just UTC, oh really you can't pick Greenwich, okay, whatever it doesn't say Greenwich.

696
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:22,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, GMT and UTC are not a hundred percent exactly the same thing, but they're the same time.

697
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:24,249
Speaker 0: Oh, I can bet Caracas or Santiago

698
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,052
Speaker 1: effectively

699
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:32,464
Speaker 0: anyway, and not just that like you might think All right, maybe I could do it manually like all right I put in minus five because that's you know I'm there except

700
00:41:32,584 --> 00:41:37,020
Speaker 1: if you pick minus five when the time changes because of daylight savings you gotta switch it to minus four.

701
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:39,153
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what are you gonna switch it back to minus five?

702
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:40,220
Speaker 0: And what if you're in Indiana?

703
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,667
Speaker 0: What if you go to Indiana?

704
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:44,440
Speaker 1: and it's not just a matter of you know, what date?

705
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,714
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, you know people are used to just waking up at like 8 a.m.

706
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:48,860
Speaker 1: And changing their time back.

707
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,609
Speaker 1: You know, it doesn't matter if you do it right away.

708
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:53,957
Speaker 1: and for displaying dates to human beings It doesn't matter right away.

709
00:41:54,482 --> 00:42:00,066
Speaker 1: But for computers computer needs to have the time change at the exact Millisecond that the time changes.

710
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:10,616
Speaker 1: if the daylight savings time changes at midnight on October something I don't even know what date is supposed to be They need to happen that second the clock has to go blip and go back an hour immediately.

711
00:42:10,897 --> 00:42:11,740
Speaker 0: now this information.

712
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,093
Speaker 0: I mean who has this information?

713
00:42:13,234 --> 00:42:15,991
Speaker 0: It's Countries can kind of do what they want.

714
00:42:16,051 --> 00:42:17,800
Speaker 0: So in the US it doesn't matter.

715
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:25,020
Speaker 0: We don't change around our time zones very often and in most of you need to know what day the daylight savings time flips.

716
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:27,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, every year change forever.

717
00:42:27,696 --> 00:42:29,600
Speaker 0: until recently We were stupid and move suffer.

718
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:37,126
Speaker 1: But also there's some funky ass states that are like split in the middle and there's some other states that like do different things And it's weird.

719
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:48,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think I just want to say in terms of time zones You know talking about time zones specifically sort of off-topic But the point is I think what we should all do is the entire world should just use 24-hour UTC clocks.

720
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:53,695
Speaker 1: there should be no time zones and wherever you live you just get used to it.

721
00:42:53,755 --> 00:43:07,380
Speaker 1: if you're waking up at 13 and going to bed at 24 and meanwhile on another time zone people get up at 7 and go to bed it some you Then just get used to whatever your number happens to be where you live and that should be it.

722
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:15,433
Speaker 0: I'm entirely ambivalent because while I see the merits of your proposal I also see the useful normalization of being able to say 7 p.m.

723
00:43:15,453 --> 00:43:21,108
Speaker 0: And that means Evening to everyone in their context.

724
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:25,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how useful it would to be to be like we're going to have this.

725
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:31,763
Speaker 1: You know, we're going to record this podcast at 13 and just everyone knows 13.

726
00:43:31,763 --> 00:43:33,147
Speaker 0: I definitely see the use in it.

727
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:43,520
Speaker 0: For example, anytime someone said, you know, some of our listeners live on that other coast I don't know why but they occasionally will say hey, we're gonna play a game of counter-strike at four o'clock PST.

728
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:48,640
Speaker 0: And my answer is to ignore all things that are at any time other than Eastern, right?

729
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:54,900
Speaker 1: It would be so much easier if we just said hey We're gonna do it at 14 and everyone just did and no one even had to think about time zones ever.

730
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:59,820
Speaker 0: No, well think about the weird problems you can have like say alright, my computer just jumps forward and falls back.

731
00:44:00,941 --> 00:44:02,927
Speaker 0: What if I'm writing log files?

732
00:44:03,368 --> 00:44:04,552
Speaker 0: All right jumping forwards fine.

733
00:44:04,652 --> 00:44:05,254
Speaker 0: I jump forward.

734
00:44:05,274 --> 00:44:08,864
Speaker 0: There's just an hour gap in my logs once a year Falling back.

735
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:14,337
Speaker 0: something happened at you know 1 45 a.m Something happened at 1 45 a.m Which one is which?

736
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, did this actually happen at the same time as another thing or an hour later?

737
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:19,903
Speaker 0: So what do you?

738
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:22,240
Speaker 1: of course the log file usually writes in order?

739
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,522
Speaker 1: So what you're gonna see is you're gonna see 11 59 then 11.

740
00:44:25,522 --> 00:44:26,728
Speaker 0: But what if it's a log file?

741
00:44:26,768 --> 00:44:29,260
Speaker 0: that's machine read that's based on timestamps.

742
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,839
Speaker 1: This is why you always have your log files writing in UTC.

743
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:33,784
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even that.

744
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:39,851
Speaker 0: so what if for example, you know, we don't want to talk about the tech stuff Let's talk about the real story about the for the story.

745
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:43,696
Speaker 0: So, uh This database, you know, you have to maintain this.

746
00:44:43,736 --> 00:44:44,280
Speaker 1: What's what is it?

747
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,544
Speaker 1: I'll send something.

748
00:44:45,564 --> 00:44:47,513
Speaker 0: I forget I got something vague.

749
00:44:47,593 --> 00:44:48,517
Speaker 0: I barely knew about it.

750
00:44:48,558 --> 00:44:51,879
Speaker 0: to be honest This shows that even we don't pay attention that much until there's a problem.

751
00:44:52,843 --> 00:44:53,526
Speaker 1: But it is.

752
00:44:53,586 --> 00:44:57,120
Speaker 1: it's the all since easy database so countries can change their stuff.

753
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:08,200
Speaker 0: I mean what if some countries like oh I'm changing X someone's got to collect all that information and put it somewhere and You can't trust private companies to just do that because they'll probably try to charge money for the database.

754
00:45:08,462 --> 00:45:09,569
Speaker 0: Try to license it out.

755
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:13,705
Speaker 0: some sort of bullshit shenanigans On the web and the mailing list.

756
00:45:14,206 --> 00:45:15,069
Speaker 0: for this whole thing.

757
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:18,298
Speaker 0: a post was made four days eight hours and 23 minutes ago.

758
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,060
Speaker 0: Quote a civil suit was filed on September 30th in federal court in Boston.

759
00:45:24,802 --> 00:45:25,624
Speaker 0: I'm the defendant.

760
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:28,230
Speaker 0: the case involves the timezone database.

761
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:34,426
Speaker 0: the FTP server at LC dot NCI dot nih dot gov Has been shut down.

762
00:45:34,928 --> 00:45:37,579
Speaker 0: the mailing list will be shut down after this message.

763
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:43,148
Speaker 0: electronic mail can be sent to me at Arthur David Olson at gmail.com.

764
00:45:43,328 --> 00:45:46,477
Speaker 0: I like how this super GNU Linux sounding guy uses Gmail.

765
00:45:46,697 --> 00:45:47,680
Speaker 0: that says a lot actually.

766
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:50,434
Speaker 0: I hope there will be better news shortly Otto.

767
00:45:50,957 --> 00:46:03,760
Speaker 0: and That innocuous letter made thousands of nerds around the world start screaming fuck Yeah, I mean I was just actually today.

768
00:46:04,122 --> 00:46:11,980
Speaker 1: I had to write a program that used the timezone data And I used the Python TZ data module and it worked even though this database is down.

769
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,934
Speaker 0: But if some change happens you won't be up to date.

770
00:46:15,135 --> 00:46:15,577
Speaker 1: That's true.

771
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:22,419
Speaker 0: I'll be fucked Yeah, which actually is fine for most of the industrialized world in the short term very short term.

772
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:27,300
Speaker 0: now The story as far as I can tell is that this private company is suing them, right?

773
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,374
Speaker 1: So here's the story as it is on Wikipedia, which is as trustworthy as Wikipedia.

774
00:46:31,474 --> 00:46:33,180
Speaker 0: is you tell it the Wikipedia way?

775
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,404
Speaker 0: And I have this other article.

776
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:35,508
Speaker 0: Okay, we'll see if there's any.

777
00:46:35,528 --> 00:46:40,748
Speaker 1: there's a lost route a lawsuit between astrolabe Incorporated verse Olson et al.

778
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:43,620
Speaker 1: it was filed concerning copyright of the database, right?

779
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:48,283
Speaker 1: So the database is maintenance and dissemination operations are shut down The you.

780
00:46:48,323 --> 00:46:57,738
Speaker 1: the case revolves around the use by the database maintainers of the atlases the American Atlas by Thomas G Shanks and the International Atlas by Thomas G. Shanks and Rick Pottinger.

781
00:46:58,242 --> 00:47:10,800
Speaker 1: It's specifically complaints of unauthorized Reproduction of the atlases data in the timezone mailing list archive and some auxiliary link collections maintained with it with the database But doesn't actually point at the database itself.

782
00:47:11,301 --> 00:47:18,720
Speaker 1: The complaint relates only to the compilation of historical timezone data and does not cover timezone data world timezone tables.

783
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:27,118
Speaker 1: The Atlas is one of the favored sources for the database And so the database includes much factual data that has been copied from it.

784
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:29,888
Speaker 0: now There are many ways to look at this.

785
00:47:29,968 --> 00:47:30,570
Speaker 0: on one hand.

786
00:47:31,172 --> 00:47:33,180
Speaker 0: It takes effort to gather facts.

787
00:47:33,421 --> 00:47:33,782
Speaker 0: It's so.

788
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:40,688
Speaker 0: maybe we have a vested interest in protecting the intellectual property rights of people who gather facts So that they will continue to gather facts.

789
00:47:40,909 --> 00:47:49,740
Speaker 1: the fact fact gathering is incredibly useful Even though say an almanac would only collect, you know publicly available information and publish it in a compact format.

790
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:51,587
Speaker 1: It takes work to produce that.

791
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:54,800
Speaker 0: so that work you want your reward and it is a useful service.

792
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:55,946
Speaker 1: So we want people.

793
00:47:55,966 --> 00:47:59,322
Speaker 1: you know, I don't necessarily needs to be intellectual property But there needs to be.

794
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:04,644
Speaker 0: it is intellectual property just doesn't necessarily need to be the current copyright regimen We have.

795
00:48:04,665 --> 00:48:06,520
Speaker 1: I'm just saying there needs to be some way to you know.

796
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,440
Speaker 1: We want to encourage and come and perhaps compensate those people by a means.

797
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:19,080
Speaker 1: It may not be an intellectual property means but some means probably a good idea, but simultaneously We want people to collect facts in useful ways.

798
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:28,580
Speaker 0: We have a vested interest as a society to make factual information readily available with zero Licensing concerns of any kind, right?

799
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:40,420
Speaker 1: I should not have to pay anyone any amount of money to know what the time zone is Anywhere ever in the history of the world or the future let alone that needs to be publicly available and free information for all people

800
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:45,949
Speaker 0: Now let alone what the time zone was Twenty-four point six seven years ago,

801
00:48:46,029 --> 00:48:49,360
Speaker 1: which also needs to be publicly available and for free for everyone forever.

802
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:51,157
Speaker 0: That's the kind of thing that should be in a history book.

803
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:56,276
Speaker 0: Exactly now that the new Law gets down to the weird stuff of like.

804
00:48:56,698 --> 00:49:04,845
Speaker 0: say, you know If I read if I have a history book that talks about Peter the Great doing something and I copy that text verbatim Committing copyright violations.

805
00:49:04,865 --> 00:49:05,347
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

806
00:49:05,728 --> 00:49:13,492
Speaker 0: But if I just take the facts from that book and republish them on my own I'm not actually sure what the specific line is where someone can go after.

807
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:16,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, as long as you got a bibliography going on Right.

808
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:18,000
Speaker 1: I mean you that's all you did in school, right?

809
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:18,542
Speaker 1: Is that you would?

810
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:23,020
Speaker 1: they would say read books and don't plagiarize but you still have to get the facts from the books and you?

811
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,946
Speaker 1: Would cite them and then that was considered.

812
00:49:25,026 --> 00:49:26,210
Speaker 1: Okay, I think there was.

813
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:36,554
Speaker 0: I turned in the same essay to five different professors at RIT And in my bibliography I cited myself Giving it for another class, but I obfuscated it and no one noticed.

814
00:49:36,775 --> 00:49:40,480
Speaker 0: but had they called me on it I did not actually violate any of the policies of the school.

815
00:49:40,822 --> 00:49:44,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, but that is they really was kind of a great essay, too.

816
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:48,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I don't even remember.

817
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,199
Speaker 1: I was saying cuz you're funny story.

818
00:49:49,943 --> 00:50:01,572
Speaker 0: In fact one class I didn't do the real essay and I was gonna get like a C. so I was like look can I write a paper just for you on some other topic like say This thing I already wrote an essay on that.

819
00:50:01,592 --> 00:50:03,059
Speaker 0: I've turned into four other professors.

820
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:07,485
Speaker 1: That's good stuff.

821
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:08,471
Speaker 1: All right.

822
00:50:08,692 --> 00:50:13,735
Speaker 0: So anyway, so Basically at what point do we?

823
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:14,860
Speaker 0: eminent domain?

824
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:23,215
Speaker 0: Factual information that has been collected even if someone put effort into collecting it but more importantly This company that's suing these people.

825
00:50:23,236 --> 00:50:25,707
Speaker 0: I Can't really be on their side.

826
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:30,080
Speaker 0: No because who is going to buy this data?

827
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of like, you know, even you know, there's certain things I don't even think you know.

828
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,900
Speaker 1: Most people would say all the US government should eminent domain and or something like that.

829
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,422
Speaker 1: It's like.

830
00:50:40,442 --> 00:50:42,650
Speaker 1: no the world should eminent domain it.

831
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,076
Speaker 1: this needs to be for everyone.

832
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:45,542
Speaker 1: It's not just one country Right.

833
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:48,172
Speaker 1: This data is important for the entire world.

834
00:50:48,554 --> 00:50:53,372
Speaker 1: Nobody should be without this data They just have like some international law come down and be like BAM.

835
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:55,680
Speaker 0: There's no such thing as international law.

836
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:59,772
Speaker 0: It's only there if countries are willing to enforce it but there should be some.

837
00:51:00,053 --> 00:51:01,639
Speaker 1: this is why we need some sort of Internet.

838
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:02,885
Speaker 1: should Be its own country, right?

839
00:51:02,905 --> 00:51:03,630
Speaker 1: It's just like BAM.

840
00:51:03,911 --> 00:51:05,440
Speaker 1: This data is now public for everyone.

841
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:07,447
Speaker 1: Here's some money guys who collected it.

842
00:51:07,728 --> 00:51:13,200
Speaker 1: now it belongs to everybody the end and then you know The higher one guy to maintain it.

843
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:22,073
Speaker 0: The thing is effectively if the if that were to happen in the US that effectively means that that happened for the world But it'd be better if it was really for the world.

844
00:51:22,274 --> 00:51:29,500
Speaker 0: Ah, but if it was truly international We're still in dodgy territory as to you know, international organizations still have to have people in places.

845
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,088
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why we need to fix that flakiness.

846
00:51:32,148 --> 00:51:38,851
Speaker 0: moon moon, maybe Antarctica space station Maybe we need a Washington DC equivalent of the internet.

847
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:41,360
Speaker 1: We need actually, you know satellite wouldn't be a bad idea.

848
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,755
Speaker 1: We could just take all the important data's and put them in a satellite.

849
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:50,880
Speaker 1: then, you know Like a homemade satellite that'll have great throughput and incredibly low latency, but it doesn't need to be hit that often.

850
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,165
Speaker 1: We just need to keep it somewhere.

851
00:51:52,205 --> 00:51:52,727
Speaker 1: It's like great.

852
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:55,860
Speaker 1: You won your lawsuit against who you can't sue face.

853
00:51:56,121 --> 00:51:57,405
Speaker 1: Yeah, you hit space lawsuit.

854
00:51:57,585 --> 00:51:59,050
Speaker 1: No, you know what you win.

855
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,200
Speaker 0: I hereby award you 10 million space dollars.

856
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,298
Speaker 1: Congratulations.

857
00:52:04,903 --> 00:52:06,278
Speaker 0: Here's a penny, but I need change.

858
00:52:10,722 --> 00:52:23,026
Speaker 0: Now it is worth noting that Microsoft Windows and probably presumably at least many of the cell phone providers that they might be using their own files because Microsoft According to this guy.

859
00:52:23,046 --> 00:52:28,380
Speaker 0: I'm looking at his website has their own time zone data files that they get from some other source.

860
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I can't use those Microsoft ones and say my own personal app Can I?

861
00:52:32,963 --> 00:52:45,620
Speaker 1: I don't know I could probably if I'm writing a Windows app There's probably API calls to access that data But they probably you know I can't just take that out of Windows and start using it my Linux app or my iPhone app.

862
00:52:46,141 --> 00:52:51,258
Speaker 1: I need something more general and free like the Python T Python TZ data module, which I use today.

863
00:52:51,278 --> 00:52:56,505
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah But anyway, it's not.

864
00:52:56,545 --> 00:53:11,697
Speaker 1: you know, we this came up because of the timezone issue with this particular server going down But there's actually a whole bunch of things just like this that are Either more clear or less clear in terms of should the information be public and all that kind of thing.

865
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:14,564
Speaker 1: For example Maps right.

866
00:53:14,584 --> 00:53:17,820
Speaker 1: There's a lot of companies that make maps and cartography is hard.

867
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we need to reward these people.

868
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:23,880
Speaker 1: but or at least, you know, there needs to be incentive for people to do cartography.

869
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:33,712
Speaker 1: but at the same time Knowing where shit is and knowing the shape of the earth and knowing, you know That should not be secrets that people should have to pay for.

870
00:53:34,114 --> 00:53:36,784
Speaker 1: if you need to know where something is It doesn't matter where it.

871
00:53:36,804 --> 00:53:44,593
Speaker 0: but I did see stories of people lobbying to shut down Google Maps in its early days on the grounds that having free maps that were that accessible.

872
00:53:44,633 --> 00:53:47,745
Speaker 0: and I think the same thing happened with What was that side?

873
00:53:47,765 --> 00:53:53,626
Speaker 1: I used to use before man quest map quest Yahoo Maps Microsoft also, I think no use.

874
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:55,652
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there's a Bing Maps also.

875
00:53:56,074 --> 00:54:01,832
Speaker 0: until recently actually kind of an aside Map quest used to have better driving directions, but now Google caught up.

876
00:54:02,093 --> 00:54:13,672
Speaker 1: So well because Google does everything based on data So it just took long enough for their computers to learn whereas map quest was you know better to start out with because they hired People to drive around that too, but they also didn't.

877
00:54:13,752 --> 00:54:15,660
Speaker 1: it didn't learn at the same rate as Google Maps.

878
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,939
Speaker 1: So Google Maps started out crappier but caught up.

879
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:23,120
Speaker 0: The only time Google Maps kind of fails is when you're trying to drive through Manhattan anywhere around Manhattan.

880
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,425
Speaker 0: It like pulls you into Manhattan.

881
00:54:24,445 --> 00:54:27,937
Speaker 0: It's like don't go over the RFK go through a tunnel and drive through Manhattan.

882
00:54:27,957 --> 00:54:28,680
Speaker 1: It'll be fine.

883
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:32,354
Speaker 0: But so what do we do there?

884
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:37,352
Speaker 0: I mean Should we just eminent domain all the maps people made?

885
00:54:37,552 --> 00:54:39,900
Speaker 0: Well, I mean there we have government workers making maps.

886
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,031
Speaker 1: There is actually an open map site.

887
00:54:42,775 --> 00:54:43,660
Speaker 1: I forget what it's called.

888
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,300
Speaker 1: I think it's open street map and they get a bunch of maps from this.

889
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:52,840
Speaker 1: I think it's like a tiger database, which is a database of open maps, but it's not a hundred percent, right?

890
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,760
Speaker 1: But it's a lot of maps, but it's not all the math.

891
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,743
Speaker 0: So what about that?

892
00:54:56,763 --> 00:55:03,103
Speaker 1: would be like if there was a free government dish timezone database that only had most of the time zones in It but not all of them.

893
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,852
Speaker 0: What about Google Maps where it's freezing beer?

894
00:55:06,193 --> 00:55:08,320
Speaker 1: pretty much, but it's not freezing speech.

895
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:13,908
Speaker 0: I mean People embed Google Maps all the time.

896
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:15,995
Speaker 0: You can make your own maps and directions and everything.

897
00:55:16,095 --> 00:55:17,319
Speaker 0: It's effectively free.

898
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:21,000
Speaker 0: Sorry, those all intents and purposes not all the intent.

899
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,278
Speaker 1: There are certain, you know, if you want obviously for most things normal people are gonna do.

900
00:55:25,338 --> 00:55:25,820
Speaker 1: it covers it.

901
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,196
Speaker 1: But there is some weird things that you a map person might want to do that.

902
00:55:30,216 --> 00:55:31,440
Speaker 1: You just can't do on Google Man.

903
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,143
Speaker 0: Can you name one?

904
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:36,780
Speaker 1: I'm not a map expert, but I'm sure you know, there's something that someone might want to do.

905
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,361
Speaker 1: It doesn't do.

906
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:43,590
Speaker 0: I was trying to find the terms of service and I actually couldn't find them quickly.

907
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,218
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna yeah regardless.

908
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:46,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I don't know.

909
00:55:46,966 --> 00:55:47,670
Speaker 0: I don't have a good answer.

910
00:55:48,052 --> 00:55:49,560
Speaker 0: I don't know what the best way to handle this is.

911
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,269
Speaker 1: How about even something like phone books?

912
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,956
Speaker 0: or Well phone books just need to disappear.

913
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:58,050
Speaker 1: Well that too, but I mean still a directory of phone numbers and names, right?

914
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:59,273
Speaker 0: I think about it.

915
00:55:59,334 --> 00:56:02,828
Speaker 0: Most people don't want there to be a directory of their phone number and name.

916
00:56:02,848 --> 00:56:03,632
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter It's.

917
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:05,670
Speaker 1: it's actually had this idea this morning, right?

918
00:56:06,332 --> 00:56:13,412
Speaker 0: What if the majority of people who know me couldn't look me up in the phone book because the name that would show up would Not match any name they know I was thinking.

919
00:56:13,512 --> 00:56:15,999
Speaker 1: what if we made a crowdsource database?

920
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:25,890
Speaker 1: and the way the crowdsource database works is you type in Information about other people that you know, for example, you look across the street out your window at your neighbor's house.

921
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:32,971
Speaker 0: You know the address of your neighbors you go to that address and you're like one occupant blonde hair blue eyes Where's?

922
00:56:33,052 --> 00:56:42,109
Speaker 1: maybe you wetters, maybe you even know their name, you know what cars they have you know a license plates that are on their cars and you just start typing this stuff in and just everyone starts doing it.

923
00:56:42,129 --> 00:56:47,668
Speaker 1: and Eventually, we have a database of everything that no one opted into and there's nothing anyone could do about it.

924
00:56:47,748 --> 00:56:48,330
Speaker 0: I had an idea.

925
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:51,142
Speaker 0: I wanted to do that just for the WTF moments.

926
00:56:51,162 --> 00:57:00,617
Speaker 0: I wanted to make like what the fuck calm where you Post locations and timestamps for something happened and try to get other people to give you data about what was going on in that Area at that time right?

927
00:57:00,637 --> 00:57:15,010
Speaker 0: It's like it's always like, you know, there's this A shitstorm because look at how many countries in the world and how many people are so mad that Google has the audacity To take free pictures of every street and put them online.

928
00:57:17,691 --> 00:57:18,695
Speaker 0: So, what would they do?

929
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:21,386
Speaker 0: they gotta blur out the license plates - I don't think they should.

930
00:57:21,406 --> 00:57:22,430
Speaker 1: I don't think they should either.

931
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:23,676
Speaker 0: I don't think they should have to any of them.

932
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,955
Speaker 0: and you yeah, whatever you want to make that website You want to add that to the shit-talk list.

933
00:57:27,996 --> 00:57:29,240
Speaker 0: we get sued so fast.

934
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:31,830
Speaker 0: It's sued the fastest someone else make that website.

935
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:33,376
Speaker 0: I will put in so much data.

936
00:57:33,698 --> 00:57:38,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, I might even invest in you, but I will not make it whatever.

937
00:57:39,031 --> 00:57:42,060
Speaker 1: But yeah, all these these databases of important information.

938
00:57:42,442 --> 00:57:44,207
Speaker 1: We got a we got to do something about this.

939
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:46,715
Speaker 0: I don't know what Government subsidy.

940
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:51,570
Speaker 1: I don't know it either but you know what, you know for something like time zones Like you can make a personal backup of that shit.

941
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:58,880
Speaker 1: but there are a lot bigger databases out there that you can't make a personal backup of and They could be problems if something happens to them.

942
00:57:59,222 --> 00:58:01,170
Speaker 1: because like one country's a dick or something.

943
00:58:07,205 --> 00:58:09,740
