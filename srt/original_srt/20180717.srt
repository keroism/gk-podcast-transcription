1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,272
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday July 17th 2018.

2
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:13,694
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:16,120
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:20,652
Speaker 0: We're talking about PUBG player unknowns Battlegrounds.

5
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:25,366
Speaker 0: because we are in no way late to this party Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:32,780
Speaker 0: The kids got to understand that the older you get the later you're going to be to every party.

7
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:34,649
Speaker 1: No, you just don't get time for that action.

8
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:35,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, even counter-strike.

9
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:39,088
Speaker 1: I didn't play till beta Eight something like that six.

10
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:39,730
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,553
Speaker 1: so I started.

12
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:42,439
Speaker 1: somebody was playing counter-strike before me.

13
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:46,656
Speaker 0: I was playing counter-strike before the p90 but not that long before the p90.

14
00:00:48,142 --> 00:00:50,470
Speaker 1: Playing it before the UM for sure.

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,115
Speaker 0: I remember when they added the p90.

16
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:53,500
Speaker 1: remember when they added the UM.

17
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:58,000
Speaker 0: And then I remember when the p90 was ridiculously overpowered.

18
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:01,308
Speaker 1: Remember that also cuz p90 was my favorite.

19
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:02,794
Speaker 0: It was a good time that p90.

20
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:03,517
Speaker 0: I remember those days.

21
00:01:03,537 --> 00:01:04,138
Speaker 0: Those are good days.

22
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:09,234
Speaker 1: 90 is like the number one gun of you know gun fetish fanboys.

23
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:11,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's I mean gunslinger girls.

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,726
Speaker 1: I think whenever I see like some, you know, like especially yeah, especially anime but like it is any sort of military fanboy stuff It's always p90.

25
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:20,100
Speaker 0: It's always that bullpup.

26
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:22,729
Speaker 0: You know the one from counter-strike the.

27
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:25,139
Speaker 0: oh god, I remember what was called the stair hog.

28
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:26,225
Speaker 1: It's either.

29
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:28,035
Speaker 1: you can get an aug and pub G in a crate.

30
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:28,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen one.

31
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:29,663
Speaker 0: I've never.

32
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:30,447
Speaker 0: I've never got.

33
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,840
Speaker 1: I let the other guy have it cuz there's no point in me taking it.

34
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:36,154
Speaker 0: I usually get the scar like that's the weapon I end up using the most.

35
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:37,500
Speaker 1: I actually rarely see that.

36
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:38,933
Speaker 0: I find it a lot.

37
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:42,819
Speaker 0: It's not great I don't like it, but I end up with it a lot to the point that I think about it.

38
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,307
Speaker 0: Hmm last time I saw it.

39
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:44,750
Speaker 0: I looked at it.

40
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,197
Speaker 0: I was like, yeah, you know what?

41
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:50,410
Speaker 0: Nah Nah, I'll pick up the shotgun instead and that let me tell you that worked.

42
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:51,434
Speaker 0: Not at all.

43
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:53,280
Speaker 0: No fuck shotgun shotguns are worth.

44
00:01:55,443 --> 00:02:04,850
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's the main vid when we talk about the fact that we're playing pub G but we got some news cuz it's Tuesday All right, so Mario tennis is out and it's guy.

45
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,191
Speaker 1: it's not.

46
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:06,154
Speaker 1: it's got some problems.

47
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:12,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is this is the second weakest Mario tennis offering from Nintendo.

48
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:14,412
Speaker 1: so it has a lot of it's like it's.

49
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,515
Speaker 1: it's better than the.

50
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:16,157
Speaker 1: it's not.

51
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:20,454
Speaker 1: it is Mario tennis Right, but there's a lot of not the bullshit DS one is real.

52
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:21,760
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things they messed up.

53
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:23,379
Speaker 1: I'm sure we'll review it at some point.

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,625
Speaker 1: But so I'll just talk about the news here the news being that they are going to actually update it and they're gonna nerf Bowser Jr.

55
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:31,131
Speaker 1: Who is Opie?

56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,480
Speaker 1: Yep, and they're gonna adjust the way the trick shot works is right now.

57
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:41,357
Speaker 1: You can basically just keep trick shotting over and over always return the ball no matter what

58
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,103
Speaker 0: with a trick shot no matter what and that

59
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:51,832
Speaker 1: will fill up your charge meter to max and then you can use the power shot and then Contend and repeat using the trick shot again, and that's pretty much the strategy for winning.

60
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:56,870
Speaker 1: It's similar to snaking in Mario Kart Basically the exact same problem.

61
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,340
Speaker 0: It's not fun like trick shots are not that fun?

62
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really like them.

63
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:08,430
Speaker 1: actually you can play in the mode that has no meter and it removes the trick shot And I actually kind of feel like the thing is.

64
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:23,033
Speaker 1: the problem with that mode that I found is that it Chainchomp and certain characters are actually more powerful because without some sort of super shot or zone shot It's like they can almost always get to the ball and return it Yeah, and you know with with relative ease, but

65
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:28,695
Speaker 0: the trouble is and I even ran into this I haven't even played Kid Koopa because it's money even though he's like my character.

66
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:29,980
Speaker 0: I love the shit out of that kid.

67
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:36,097
Speaker 0: I don't like him being in the stupid clown car like I don't like the aesthetic so I ended up playing Rosalina instead.

68
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:41,980
Speaker 1: I play As you do who is also an OP character with these nasty hooks and shit.

69
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:44,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, which has always been the case in Mario Tennis.

70
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:49,236
Speaker 1: I still feel even in Mario Tennis for n64 boo is like tricky and he would.

71
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:51,449
Speaker 1: he hits the ball It curbs like a motherfucker.

72
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,543
Speaker 0: I do miss Older.

73
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,853
Speaker 0: Mario tennis is though like I just play older Mario.

74
00:03:55,913 --> 00:03:57,560
Speaker 0: I feel like as our friend group.

75
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,667
Speaker 0: That's probably what we should do.

76
00:03:58,688 --> 00:03:59,312
Speaker 1: I have it.

77
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:00,299
Speaker 1: We can just play at any time.

78
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,720
Speaker 0: But yeah, this is interesting for a bunch of reasons.

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,269
Speaker 0: so one obviously the game needed to be nerfed like that.

80
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:11,860
Speaker 0: like there's problems with the game's core design, but Why didn't Nintendo pick up on that before they released the game?

81
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:13,265
Speaker 1: This game is.

82
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:16,375
Speaker 1: you can just sort of tell that it was obviously released too soon.

83
00:04:16,415 --> 00:04:20,159
Speaker 0: They sort of rushed it out, which is missing textures and all this.

84
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:24,439
Speaker 1: It's very unlike Nintendo to put out a product like this.

85
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:28,639
Speaker 0: I mean when we played that preview like it really didn't feel good.

86
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:33,295
Speaker 0: No had problems and like the netcode doesn't really work like playing multiplayer.

87
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,947
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have bought it, but I Pre-ordered it and forgot.

88
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:37,730
Speaker 1: Well, I pre-ordered.

89
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:44,816
Speaker 1: the reason I bought it was because You know that the demo even though it had some problems I wasn't gonna play online.

90
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:45,800
Speaker 1: those are online problems.

91
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:50,090
Speaker 1: Mostly I was like, oh well, the tennis part is still good I'm gonna play this locally so I don't care.

92
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,700
Speaker 1: and then when I actually got it I found out you couldn't even play like actual tennis.

93
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:56,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll talk about a full review.

94
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,619
Speaker 0: But the other problems with the game aside from the fact that Nintendo Clearly didn't play test this with anyone who tried to be good at the game at all.

95
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:08,880
Speaker 0: This isn't like overwatch or like someone figures out a very difficult strategy.

96
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,279
Speaker 0: It becomes the new meta over time.

97
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,286
Speaker 0: This was like day one.

98
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:16,440
Speaker 0: you can just snake and it's invincible and if you don't snake you lose.

99
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:23,066
Speaker 0: but aside from that like you can't actually play real Matches of tennis you

100
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:27,201
Speaker 1: can either play like this sort of tiebreaker only quick man Like

101
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,947
Speaker 0: not even normal tennis card

102
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:33,854
Speaker 1: or you can basically play this one set match where it's like you get two games And then you win it.

103
00:05:34,722 --> 00:05:40,720
Speaker 1: Play like you can't play like a five-set match and like feel the other player out and anything like that.

104
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it's really actually not fun and shit.

105
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:51,172
Speaker 0: as much as that seems like a really like minor point it actually really Really makes playing local multiplayer not fun.

106
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:55,172
Speaker 1: if I had known you couldn't play like five sets I thought I would even question that like.

107
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:56,480
Speaker 1: oh, of course, it's Mario tennis.

108
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,988
Speaker 1: You can be able to play a match of tennis.

109
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,004
Speaker 1: if I would have known you couldn't play a match of tennis I wouldn't have bought it.

110
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:03,598
Speaker 1: Yep, but there was no way to know that but I could.

111
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:06,149
Speaker 1: I guess I could have waited one day instead of pre-ordering.

112
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:08,418
Speaker 1: I could have waited a day and then bought it.

113
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,760
Speaker 0: Yep I too was over optimistic.

114
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:16,320
Speaker 1: I was just inconceivable that you would not be able to play a tennis match.

115
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:20,860
Speaker 1: Yeah That's like if you bought a racing game and it only had one lap races and you couldn't do a three-lap race.

116
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,542
Speaker 1: It's like Nintendo.

117
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,932
Speaker 1: It's like you wouldn't be conceivable that that would be me.

118
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:31,215
Speaker 0: You also can't pick the map Yeah, but I guess I assumed that Nintendo would have the problems.

119
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:34,307
Speaker 0: They always have meaning Online play is garbage.

120
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:34,929
Speaker 0: never do it.

121
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:37,780
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and there'd be some like single-player mode.

122
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,867
Speaker 0: I won't care about and those things were true.

123
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:43,480
Speaker 0: But on top of that like nothing else really works.

124
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,286
Speaker 1: That's the only thing it's like.

125
00:06:44,306 --> 00:06:52,914
Speaker 1: I actually like the single-player mode in old Mario tennis is because it was literally just play tennis against the computer into as and learn and get better at playing tennis until you Can beat the hardest AI?

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:01,236
Speaker 1: Whereas now the single-player mode is like this adventure with all these garbage Challenges in it that are annoying as fuck and I quit after like yeah one try like.

127
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:23,959
Speaker 0: I guess Ostensibly they make you because the the real skill in the game as it is today is one You have to trick shot literally every shot But two you have to return Fancy shots with frame per semi frame perfect timing like this very particular timing and you have to get really good at that.

128
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:27,951
Speaker 0: But all the single-player doesn't really make you good at that.

129
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:43,164
Speaker 0: It makes you good at that in these weird contrived situations and there isn't really a good single-player against just like normal tennis and The hardest AI in some very very short games and just play lots of them But that's not fun.

130
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:45,732
Speaker 0: and then or playing local multiplayer.

131
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:57,220
Speaker 0: Also was actually really hard to make work like we had a lot of trouble getting the right controllers and Nintendo really just was sloppy in this game to a degree that I'm not pre-ordering any more first-party game.

132
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,470
Speaker 1: I'm gonna wait one day.

133
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least Except for Metroid Prime for this.

134
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:03,224
Speaker 1: That's a shoe it.

135
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:03,867
Speaker 0: I don't know.

136
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:04,410
Speaker 1: I'm gonna wait.

137
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:08,113
Speaker 0: How could measure it Brian for not be a shoe I'm gonna let you play it for a few days.

138
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:08,979
Speaker 0: Let me see what you say.

139
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:11,344
Speaker 1: Just be Metroid Prime.

140
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:12,067
Speaker 0: I'm not.

141
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:13,312
Speaker 0: I'm a little worried about this.

142
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:14,918
Speaker 1: You didn't play the other Metroid Prime's.

143
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,322
Speaker 1: No Somebody.

144
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,690
Speaker 1: well, you don't need to play the new one.

145
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,936
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe maybe the new one.

146
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:20,445
Speaker 1: Why would you play one?

147
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:21,271
Speaker 1: You haven't played the other one?

148
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:21,633
Speaker 1: Why not?

149
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:22,680
Speaker 0: This might be better.

150
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:26,538
Speaker 0: I mean, I skipped a whole bunch of Zelda's and then I played Breath of the Wild.

151
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:27,020
Speaker 0: It was great.

152
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:29,790
Speaker 0: I don't feel like I need to play Skyward Sword.

153
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:31,416
Speaker 1: No, but well think about this.

154
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:32,924
Speaker 1: You're like, oh I played Breath of the Wild It was great.

155
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:33,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, guess what?

156
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,780
Speaker 1: You missed out on a whole bunch of great.

157
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:40,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I didn't even finish Twilight Princess cuz I got bored about a third of the way through.

158
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:42,932
Speaker 1: I mean, it wasn't as great but it wasn't that good wasn't that fun.

159
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:43,856
Speaker 1: It's still good.

160
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:49,195
Speaker 0: Yeah The fact that I got bored during it was enough to tell me that it wasn't for me.

161
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:51,704
Speaker 0: Hmm Breath of the Wild I feel like I'm gonna play again.

162
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:54,193
Speaker 0: Anyway, Mario attendance is a lot of problems.

163
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:55,980
Speaker 0: Nintendo didn't like play tested.

164
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:57,043
Speaker 1: They've missed.

165
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:58,468
Speaker 1: I've been talking about too much Mario tennis.

166
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:02,160
Speaker 1: Let's obvious issues and we still get we'll do an episode of Mario tennis.

167
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,644
Speaker 1: Yeah, stop talking about Mario tennis.

168
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:06,492
Speaker 0: So jack box party pack five.

169
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:07,214
Speaker 1: It's coming.

170
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:08,097
Speaker 1: There's still.

171
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:11,339
Speaker 1: they're gonna make it and so far They've revealed one of the games is gonna be in it.

172
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:19,500
Speaker 1: It's a rapping game and the way it works Is this you put in a word any freaking word you want and then it puts your word that you chose at the end of?

173
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,999
Speaker 1: A rap phrase that it is generated by the game.

174
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:35,820
Speaker 1: And then you must then enter an entire rap phrase that rhymes with the last word of your new rap phrase That you write in entirety must rhyme with the single word that was put at the end of a random previous phrase.

175
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:42,300
Speaker 1: I'm feeling that I like the box games and then a text-to-speech thing does the rap in a hilarious way.

176
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:46,296
Speaker 1: And then I think there's some sort of voting on whose is the best or whatever because originally like.

177
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:50,900
Speaker 0: there's a bunch of different ways To play these jack box games and obviously half of the party fat games are just garbage.

178
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,220
Speaker 0: Yes, but the ones that are good?

179
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,066
Speaker 0: It seems like you're paying for what you're.

180
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:59,466
Speaker 1: they're basically throwing darts at the wall and you're buying all the darts and half of them Hit.

181
00:09:59,754 --> 00:09:59,918
Speaker 0: yep.

182
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:17,840
Speaker 0: but the ones that are the most fun seems are the ones like this where they basically are in enough context and prompting to make a Situation that is both competitive but more importantly is just an excuse for you to be funny with all your friends Mm-hmm, and it guides your less funny friends into being more funny.

183
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:25,500
Speaker 0: I feel like this rap battle is gonna be right in the same feel as TKO, which is still the pinnacle of jack box.

184
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:28,108
Speaker 0: See I'll probably just buy it.

185
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:29,296
Speaker 0: I just buy every jack box game.

186
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:29,678
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,993
Speaker 0: So overwatch league playoffs weren't just on the internet.

188
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:37,220
Speaker 0: They're also on something called Disney XD.

189
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:39,949
Speaker 1: That's a the Disney Channel that shows cartoons and shit.

190
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:42,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I didn't actually know that existed.

191
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,792
Speaker 1: still That's where this Disney Channel and then this Disney XD.

192
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:47,520
Speaker 1: It's a cable channel where they show cartoons.

193
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:50,615
Speaker 1: I'm sure that is where Gravity Falls was aired.

194
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:55,580
Speaker 0: Oh, wow As far as I knew Gravity Falls was aired on this pirate ship.

195
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:07,920
Speaker 0: Gravity Falls and overwatch league are on the same channel Yeah, which is weird, but the interesting news here is that the overwatch league playoffs?

196
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:14,552
Speaker 0: we're just on Disney XD and They got a shit ton of people watch it.

197
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,508
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm like What was the number?

198
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,119
Speaker 1: is the highest ratings for Disney XD?

199
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,002
Speaker 0: 127,000 viewers.

200
00:11:20,102 --> 00:11:20,323
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

201
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:23,312
Speaker 1: That's like the numbers you see on Twitch.

202
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:25,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, Twitch had about a hundred thousand users.

203
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:34,355
Speaker 0: What's interesting is that as far as I can tell I read a bunch of like other people talking about this because I didn't even I had no idea until this news that they put this on TV.

204
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:35,239
Speaker 1: Anyway, I didn't either.

205
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:45,045
Speaker 0: and Yeah, apparently that many people watched it there despite there being basically no advertising whatsoever About it being there.

206
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:47,553
Speaker 1: I mean probably people flipped through the channels and saw overwatch.

207
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,717
Speaker 1: I'm like, holy shit.

208
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:53,500
Speaker 0: Yeah When is someone gonna be putting like fortnight on a network like this?

209
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,188
Speaker 0: Cuz for tonight is the most popular thing.

210
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:56,536
Speaker 1: I'm surprised it isn't.

211
00:11:56,938 --> 00:12:00,634
Speaker 0: yeah I'm actually really surprised for tonight could just be on like primetime TV.

212
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:02,000
Speaker 0: I think at this point probably.

213
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:14,075
Speaker 0: So I guess there are a lot of kids who just have cable still and will watch eSports on cable Instead of on Twitch for some reason.

214
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:14,418
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

215
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:21,689
Speaker 1: But I am curious about or maybe there's kids who play video games on their Playstations or the switches or whatever and you don't know about.

216
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,293
Speaker 1: they're not twitch YouTube.

217
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:23,794
Speaker 1: They're still.

218
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,880
Speaker 1: they're not technically advanced.

219
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:28,639
Speaker 0: You know, it could be like they don't even Brandon even have a PC.

220
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,523
Speaker 1: They might they.

221
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:33,057
Speaker 0: maybe you have a phone or a tablet only it might be the demo like it might like.

222
00:12:33,077 --> 00:12:39,059
Speaker 0: look at the demographic of people who go to Mid-tier local conventions like they don't know that PAX even exists.

223
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:41,419
Speaker 0: They go to a local gaming con and that's it.

224
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:50,068
Speaker 0: So if like a game studio goes to that gaming con and does a panel that is like like they would never encounter that Otherwise, even though it's just literally streaming on Twitch somewhere.

225
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:59,035
Speaker 0: So maybe it's that this is fascinating That there that this demographic exists in numbers that it does it.

226
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:07,539
Speaker 0: I I greatly underestimated the demand for eSports on cable Especially on Disney XD.

227
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:14,150
Speaker 0: So in some other news Trogdor is a fantastic thing.

228
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:14,591
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

229
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:15,996
Speaker 0: Like I want to make that very clear.

230
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:17,000
Speaker 1: It burninates the countryside.

231
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:19,740
Speaker 1: We've been fans those horrible peasants and cottages.

232
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,440
Speaker 0: I mean we Scott and I. it's not an exaggeration to say that we were literally fans of Trogdor from his inception.

233
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:28,992
Speaker 1: Yes, I saw Trogdor the day he was released to the internet.

234
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:30,217
Speaker 1: We were already.

235
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:31,140
Speaker 1: I was burninated.

236
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,300
Speaker 0: We were already pretty deep into the brothers chaps fandom well before Trogdor existed, correct?

237
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:46,967
Speaker 0: So this Kickstarter game is legit like Homestar runners actually had a pretty big Renaissance if you haven't been paying attention trying hard Yeah, but it's kind of working.

238
00:13:47,288 --> 00:14:01,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a little bit a little bit they have maintained a pretty sizable fandom Despite the fact that the type of humor that was originally homestar runner was from a much earlier time.

239
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:09,896
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't still why I don't watch any new homestar runner No, but I still strong bet on Twitter, but I watch like a while.

240
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:12,192
Speaker 0: actually a few weeks ago I ended up watching the uku lele.

241
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:17,834
Speaker 0: Okay, like I just watched an old home star runner and it was about.

242
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:24,037
Speaker 0: in terms of modern comedy sensibilities It was basically on the level of hey So it's still there.

243
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:26,588
Speaker 0: But they make it a tabletop game.

244
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:30,100
Speaker 1: is Trogdor the board game and basically this board games on Kickstarter?

245
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:36,967
Speaker 1: You can pre-order it and get either the wooden meeples or the plastic miniatures Like way over double its goal.

246
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:41,077
Speaker 1: Yeah going up and the game seems mediocre.

247
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:44,232
Speaker 1: It's a game where Basically, you're cut.

248
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:45,079
Speaker 1: What's a cop game?

249
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:51,819
Speaker 1: you take turns controlling Trogdor the burninator trying to burninate the peasants and the Thatcher of cottages and all the tiles on the board.

250
00:14:51,839 --> 00:15:00,115
Speaker 1: and Meanwhile, there's some I guess AI Controlled nights who and peasants who make things less burninated.

251
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:01,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's co-op.

252
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:06,500
Speaker 0: I like how there's a peasant meeple and then there's a fire thing to put on the peasant.

253
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:06,637
Speaker 1: Yeah.

254
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,790
Speaker 1: So it's like the theme and the end of this game is high.

255
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,773
Speaker 1: Larry is and great.

256
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:15,598
Speaker 1: the actual game does not appear to be Good, so there's no reason to buy it or play it.

257
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,999
Speaker 1: Don't laugh at the video of it and you're good to go.

258
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:29,336
Speaker 0: I guess board games are now on the level of like when all the great graphics literally no gameplay era of Pretty much has been going on for like a couple years now already at least.

259
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:35,212
Speaker 0: but the Ghostbusters Kickstarter game fruit was like the real Genesis of this even before then.

260
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:44,380
Speaker 1: but like people now especially Kickstarter There's a big you know faction of the board game community, especially online where they really like their board game collectors.

261
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:45,885
Speaker 1: They care about miniatures.

262
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:49,960
Speaker 1: They care about the quality of the cardboard and you know, they're putting shit in sleeves.

263
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,181
Speaker 1: It's like.

264
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:58,320
Speaker 1: but more importantly, you know, maybe they do play games But they actually aren't super deep into playing games and game mechanics and winning in competition.

265
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:11,638
Speaker 0: Well, there's a parallel thing going on that I've been reading a lot about around how a huge percentage of people who buy tabletop Games today in this like niche extended market core market like not mass market.

266
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:13,062
Speaker 0: We're not talking about that I'm monopoly.

267
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:20,756
Speaker 0: but a huge percentage of even people who do care about game mechanics buy games and Literally never bring them to the table.

268
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:21,079
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

269
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,620
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of reasons why we even did a packs pen a lot at one.

270
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,053
Speaker 1: I have one game on my shelf.

271
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:25,598
Speaker 1: I haven't played.

272
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:31,877
Speaker 0: I At one point bought a copy of castles of burgundy because it was on super sale.

273
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:39,920
Speaker 0: only to discover That not only did I already own castles of burgundy, but it was still in its shrink-wrap in my closet.

274
00:16:40,862 --> 00:16:44,680
Speaker 0: So if anyone wants a copy of castles of burgundy, I accidentally bought another one.

275
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:46,711
Speaker 0: I so this is a thing.

276
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:51,295
Speaker 0: but the confluence of people don't actually get games to the table.

277
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:57,816
Speaker 0: that often and People want to collect makes a perfect storm of games with literally garbage game mechanics.

278
00:16:58,277 --> 00:17:04,013
Speaker 1: and it does not matter Tons and tons of games coming out these days that are just all you know.

279
00:17:04,094 --> 00:17:08,500
Speaker 1: physical physically fancy But don't have much game going on because that's the hard part.

280
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,940
Speaker 1: It's like if you told me Scott make a board game But what matters most is the fancy pieces and the rules don't matter.

281
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,400
Speaker 1: I'd be like what roll and move and let's make some fancy miniatures.

282
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:25,731
Speaker 0: We're gonna have like a four pound like Lead-filled pewter miniature of the Baron Harkonnen, right?

283
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,172
Speaker 1: It's good.

284
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:27,135
Speaker 1: It's so easy.

285
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:28,479
Speaker 1: It's it's a piece of cake.

286
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:29,590
Speaker 1: right now It's like I'll get make a game.

287
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:30,259
Speaker 1: That's actually good.

288
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:34,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, this game comes with an entire Wooden ship.

289
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:36,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like oh, yeah.

290
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:37,374
Speaker 1: It's like it's easy to make game.

291
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:38,377
Speaker 1: that is physically.

292
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:39,040
Speaker 0: what's the game?

293
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,299
Speaker 0: It's basically just mousetrap.

294
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:52,279
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of games like that out these days and there's a lot of people are into that and I feel like they're You know, even though they're in the same Community space they're actually completely have nothing in common with people.

295
00:17:52,319 --> 00:18:05,876
Speaker 0: actually There's a really there's a neat way to tell these games and like to tell this demographic Cuz there's games you see at packs that are demoed a lot But you very much the hard one or the music card one.

296
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:12,980
Speaker 0: Oh god With the machine I care so little about that game that I'd literally the one the harmonics made.

297
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,774
Speaker 1: Yeah, honestly, that was the omega-thon final those garbage that was drop mix.

298
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:32,442
Speaker 0: Yep drop mix was the Megathon finale in packs history No game, but all kinds of fancy shit is the only packs omega-thon finale that was worse than that one was the one that actually Failed.

299
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:36,258
Speaker 0: Yep, even though that one would have been good if it hadn't failed, but it failed.

300
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:36,780
Speaker 0: so it failed.

301
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,240
Speaker 0: It was the worst one, but you see games like this.

302
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,699
Speaker 0: You know, I always get back to that Ghostbusters game But I'm not even gonna bother using that as the example anymore because there's so many games like it.

303
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:48,040
Speaker 0: But you can tell because they have a big Kickstarter.

304
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:56,319
Speaker 0: They have tons of sales a lot of people know about the game and the games are very highly reviewed But you literally never see them on the table at a PAX.

305
00:18:57,441 --> 00:19:02,700
Speaker 1: Well, just look on the shelf at the game store and you can see all these fancy schmancy games and stuff.

306
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,049
Speaker 1: But it's like the games.

307
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:08,939
Speaker 1: they actually get played a lot All right, you know back in the olden days or olden days.

308
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:17,955
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like people play fucking settlers in Carcassonne and take it to ride which are way way way less fancy But get played a lot lot lot more.

309
00:19:17,975 --> 00:19:23,538
Speaker 0: Yep But I do feel like part of this is a response to the fact that I hate to say this.

310
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:41,040
Speaker 0: the tabletop Market is pretty saturated already and the rate of games being released both from Indies and big publishers is only accelerating and the skill game space is definitely like Super-saturated right now and the euros are super saturated.

311
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:49,710
Speaker 0: This space of collect games that are primarily aimed at collectors and IP is probably way easier to grow For a lot of reasons,

312
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,660
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, they're making what sells

313
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I feel like these are selling - they're you're actually

314
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:56,980
Speaker 1: play games don't buy a lot of games.

315
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:58,426
Speaker 1: They buy a few games and play them.

316
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:01,358
Speaker 0: There are some people who play games and buy a lot of games.

317
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,142
Speaker 1: some Yeah, but not many.

318
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:04,624
Speaker 1: not enough to build a business around.

319
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:05,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely not.

320
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:14,340
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

321
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:21,600
Speaker 0: so I Am actually a big fan of the American national anthem, but not for reasons you'd think no, it's awful.

322
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,409
Speaker 0: I like it because it's awful.

323
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:38,700
Speaker 0: Okay, kind of like imagine a Sci-fi or a fantasy world where there's like some Byzantine style Archaic Ancient civilization that has like traditions and weird stuff.

324
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:45,380
Speaker 0: They go beyond memory and beyond recorded history and they have weird old rituals that no one knows where they came from.

325
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:51,860
Speaker 0: I feel like singing the American national anthem is gonna be that if America survives another thousand years.

326
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:53,766
Speaker 0: Our national anthem is fucking awful.

327
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:55,150
Speaker 0: The lyrics are awful.

328
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:58,220
Speaker 0: If you get past the first verse they get pretty fucking racist.

329
00:20:58,664 --> 00:21:05,898
Speaker 1: No one sings that part because no one knows it But it keeps going after the part that people sing and it's it's not good and it's racist.

330
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:09,169
Speaker 0: past that part Yep, it's racist and it has other problems.

331
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:09,450
Speaker 1: Yes.

332
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:16,190
Speaker 0: Also if you know anything about music It's weird and it's really hard to sing.

333
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:16,330
Speaker 1: Right?

334
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:22,153
Speaker 1: Well, they shoehorn some poem that was not musical into a song Yep, but also the way it wasn't like.

335
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:23,600
Speaker 1: they had a song and then wrote lyrics.

336
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,839
Speaker 1: They had lyrics that were whatever and they refused to change those at all.

337
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:33,724
Speaker 0: So in high school, I used to do a lot of arrangement just like I used to arrange songs like partly sometimes for money Sometimes for class whatever.

338
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:40,689
Speaker 0: but when you're arranging songs for people to sing not even just writing them Just arranging them like writing the parts.

339
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:41,837
Speaker 0: However, you're gonna do it.

340
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:49,600
Speaker 0: You take into account that most humans sing in a set range of notes And not many people can sing outside of those ranges.

341
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,700
Speaker 0: Well, and you fatigue people who try to sing outside of those ranges.

342
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:57,480
Speaker 0: You don't generally write a vocal part that crosses all these ranges.

343
00:21:57,602 --> 00:21:59,724
Speaker 1: I mean you might do that If you're know that.

344
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:03,040
Speaker 1: gaha, I'm writing this song for a such-and-such singer who has a mad range.

345
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,160
Speaker 1: I think I can make this song balls out and you say oh I'm writing this song.

346
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,700
Speaker 0: The US national anthem is like the opera and the fifth element like normal humans cannot fucking sing this song.

347
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,570
Speaker 0: no, and even worse even if you like have a decent range.

348
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:26,220
Speaker 0: if you're not a You're asked to sing the national anthem at like your high school sports ball game.

349
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:33,471
Speaker 0: Unless you're a like trained musician as opposed to someone who knows how to sing You'll even make a mistake of.

350
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:35,260
Speaker 0: you'll start to sing in your national register.

351
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:41,900
Speaker 0: Oh say like that that'll already start you too high to have a chance of hitting those later.

352
00:22:42,342 --> 00:22:43,185
Speaker 1: You'll notice a lot.

353
00:22:43,265 --> 00:22:49,609
Speaker 1: if you go to like baseball games or you know at big stadiums or things like that Where there's people singing they start low.

354
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, you gotta start low start lower than your.

355
00:22:53,002 --> 00:23:05,012
Speaker 0: But anyway to not belabor the point this video in very good detail explains why It is so hard to sing why so many people forget the lyrics.

356
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:14,457
Speaker 0: it has a compilation of some of the most amazing Fails in the history of people singing the national anthem and it's just a great video.

357
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:25,152
Speaker 0: I love the fact that our national anthem is so utterly representative of how archaic and fucked up our government is and I'll take control of the government.

358
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:26,820
Speaker 1: You can change the national anthem.

359
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:37,202
Speaker 0: I feel like we can only change the national anthem if we fix our government by Fundamentally restructuring it and I feel like our penance is that we got to keep this thing as long as our government works the way It does.

360
00:23:37,223 --> 00:23:38,632
Speaker 1: but also I can changing.

361
00:23:38,673 --> 00:23:39,760
Speaker 1: it doesn't seem to be an issue.

362
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:41,900
Speaker 1: We can change it when you change the daily savings.

363
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:50,650
Speaker 0: But I do like the idea that it's almost like this test like can The Lord who's going to take over the space whatever in the future?

364
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:54,760
Speaker 0: they have to pass the archaic test of singing the ancient song.

365
00:23:56,463 --> 00:23:57,187
Speaker 0: So do you got for me?

366
00:23:57,368 --> 00:24:16,680
Speaker 1: so they tore different home is happening right now You know, even though I like bicycling watching bicycle racing is Not super exciting because it's like, okay, it's people bicycle Whatever But it's still cool, you know, because it's basically bicycling.

367
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:20,900
Speaker 1: But yeah, because the Tour de France that basically bike everywhere in France.

368
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:23,995
Speaker 1: it's crazy how far they bike and how high they bike.

369
00:24:24,075 --> 00:24:24,759
Speaker 1: it's it's insane.

370
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:35,089
Speaker 1: and Since you're biking everywhere You're just biking on the fucking road mountain roads here past a farm there and in a city here like random person Just hanging out picnicking and like watches you go by.

371
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:37,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, so, you know things can happen.

372
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:42,200
Speaker 1: It's not like there's a wall around all the roads in France while this race happens.

373
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:54,579
Speaker 1: so somebody and this is not the first person to do this, but I think it's the first person to do at the Tour de France and I think someone else did at a different bike race And I think it was toward it polone.

374
00:24:55,241 --> 00:25:08,000
Speaker 1: But anyway, I saw it on YouTube here this person while the Tour de France Peloton is going by this road They come down the hill on a mountain bike and jump over the Tour de France.

375
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:12,335
Speaker 0: Now I will point something out as a mountain biker.

376
00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:18,920
Speaker 0: This is Probably I mean, I don't know exactly what I'm sure they practiced it and set it up and everything.

377
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,840
Speaker 0: This is actually way less dangerous than you might expect assuming the person doing it knows what they're doing.

378
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,563
Speaker 1: Right the person.

379
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:27,156
Speaker 1: if the person practiced they knew they could make this jump.

380
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:30,348
Speaker 1: they'd done it before They knew they would clear over the the riders.

381
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:33,740
Speaker 0: cuz on a mountain bike like you know, you can do it very consistently.

382
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:37,100
Speaker 1: It's not like some mega jump where there's you know, like big margins, right?

383
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:46,315
Speaker 1: It's like if you practice this you're gonna make it Yeah, but if they had fucked up which is still a non-zero chance and gone right into all those You know, that would have been whoo.

384
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:52,972
Speaker 0: I think the most likely things they would have fucked up would be They would still land in the same place that they landed.

385
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,600
Speaker 0: cuz they're gonna land in the same place no matter what.

386
00:25:55,043 --> 00:25:56,960
Speaker 0: But they would have landed sideways or upside down and killed.

387
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,764
Speaker 0: Well, it's possible.

388
00:25:57,784 --> 00:26:00,920
Speaker 1: they could like if they had hit the brakes and slowed down they could have landed short.

389
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:01,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd have to be.

390
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:03,820
Speaker 1: if you practice that much you would not do that.

391
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:15,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I'm in the way a mountain bike you basically do the same trail over and over again Like you do it slow and learn it and just like, you know car racing you memorize a true route And you do it consistently and increase your time or decrease your times.

392
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:22,600
Speaker 0: So this is while this isn't as dangerous as it looks it is still dangerous and you I'm not saying you should do this.

393
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,529
Speaker 1: No, but you can also notice the riders in the tour.

394
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,315
Speaker 1: They don't slow down for shit.

395
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:29,925
Speaker 1: No, they don't even flinch They just keep on going.

396
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:35,273
Speaker 0: This is one of those things where because no no harm No foul because no one was hurt.

397
00:26:35,736 --> 00:26:36,440
Speaker 0: This is awesome.

398
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:42,976
Speaker 0: If someone had gotten hurt other than the person doing the stunts, I would have been way less cool with this totally different news.

399
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:48,500
Speaker 0: Yeah Things okay, you know in a related thing of the day because there's another video.

400
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:49,667
Speaker 1: Oh, no, hold this closure.

401
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:51,600
Speaker 0: If you watch this video, she is fine.

402
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,292
Speaker 0: Like I double checked that the person is not a snuff film.

403
00:26:55,452 --> 00:26:56,656
Speaker 0: This is not a snuff film.

404
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,964
Speaker 0: It very likely Video.

405
00:26:59,506 --> 00:27:07,910
Speaker 0: so this person this was sold to me by FARC as Someone tried to ride over a drawbridge as it was opening.

406
00:27:08,151 --> 00:27:09,955
Speaker 1: That is not the case.

407
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,740
Speaker 0: Well, it technically is the case.

408
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:14,152
Speaker 0: No, technically the drawbridge is opening.

409
00:27:14,172 --> 00:27:18,372
Speaker 0: Yeah, and this person Attempts to bike over the drawbridge while it's opening.

410
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:18,573
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

411
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:20,059
Speaker 0: That is technically true.

412
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:23,900
Speaker 0: However, it is not an awesome Blues Brothers moment.

413
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:27,260
Speaker 0: This person is either drunk or stupid.

414
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:29,406
Speaker 0: It's really hard to tell.

415
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:31,954
Speaker 0: I suspect they might actually be both.

416
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:44,472
Speaker 0: it kind of looks like they were looking at their phone But basically they buy they bump into the guard arm that is down telling you yo don't go over this Bridge, it looks like they clearly intentionally go between them.

417
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:46,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they mess up and hit them on the way.

418
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:54,980
Speaker 0: Yeah And then they just turn sideways and literally just bike into this hole and disappear The hole that the drawbridge is about to crush.

419
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,643
Speaker 1: Yeah not not the.

420
00:27:56,764 --> 00:28:03,059
Speaker 1: not the hole in between the two pieces of road and not the cool part one at the bottom where that's because The road is lifting up.

421
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:11,220
Speaker 1: It's like at the bottom of the lifting road a space is appearing and they go into that space and then they slowly Sink into it and then you don't see what happens after that.

422
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:12,986
Speaker 0: well if you want so the video is really long.

423
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:19,316
Speaker 0: but basically eventually you see a bunch of people walk over and be like whoa, and slowly help the person out of the hole.

424
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:23,429
Speaker 0: the Drawbridges like this usually have a human controlling them.

425
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:24,834
Speaker 0: Like there's usually a tower nearby.

426
00:28:24,854 --> 00:28:26,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is some automatic thing.

427
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:27,880
Speaker 1: That's like on a schedule, right?

428
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,140
Speaker 1: It's just there's a human being who's like sitting in the tower opening the thing.

429
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:43,853
Speaker 0: The only reason this person is fine is that the person who controlled the bridge saw them bike into it and Basically hit a button to stop the bridge from moving Which actually was seemed to lift up enough for the boat to get through.

430
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:55,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is real lucky because I Could imagine a situation far worse where the boat is gonna crash into the bridge and the person in the control tower literal trolley problem.

431
00:28:55,901 --> 00:29:04,114
Speaker 1: They had to either kill the person who or let a possibly horrific Accident or a boat to kill someone on the boat probably because boats can't slow down.

432
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:05,518
Speaker 0: There aren't just boat breaks.

433
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:16,116
Speaker 0: No So, yeah again I only use this as my second thing of the day because I confirmed that the person was fine.

434
00:29:16,136 --> 00:29:17,060
Speaker 0: She had minor injuries.

435
00:29:19,142 --> 00:29:22,192
Speaker 0: I guess the moral is if you're gonna bike somewhere stupid.

436
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:26,086
Speaker 1: if a thing comes down and says drawbridge train tracks Do not go stop.

437
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:26,407
Speaker 1: Stop.

438
00:29:26,427 --> 00:29:26,689
Speaker 1: Stop.

439
00:29:26,729 --> 00:29:28,719
Speaker 1: Oh my god, don't fucking go.

440
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:29,583
Speaker 0: Oh, no, no.

441
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:32,879
Speaker 0: more importantly if you're gonna bike somewhere, you're not supposed to bike.

442
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,174
Speaker 0: Practice it Be good at it and commit to it.

443
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:39,500
Speaker 0: like the person.

444
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,819
Speaker 1: There were no red lights saying Tour de France do not jump.

445
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:43,763
Speaker 0: Yeah, I will.

446
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:45,711
Speaker 0: there was a conceptual red light because there is.

447
00:29:46,072 --> 00:29:48,040
Speaker 0: there is a voice of the heavens.

448
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:53,596
Speaker 0: That's at least saying, you know, it's probably a bad idea what you're about to do jumping over the Tour de France Like do not do this.

449
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,660
Speaker 0: But if you're gonna do this at least commit to it, don't just like derp into a pit and almost die.

450
00:30:01,244 --> 00:30:03,520
Speaker 1: Well, I think the thing is the prisoner jumped over the Tour de France.

451
00:30:03,621 --> 00:30:05,880
Speaker 1: I think they may have spent a night or so in jail.

452
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:11,420
Speaker 1: I think the person who fell into the drawbridge should have also spent in jail may have spent a night in the hospital.

453
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, so don't go to either.

454
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:18,155
Speaker 0: They're not good places to be Yeah, but if you're gonna go to jail, please do it for something awesome.

455
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:19,080
Speaker 0: That didn't hurt anyone.

456
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:30,840
Speaker 0: All right, let's see in the moment Kinetic on which we were not had for the first time in like 10 gods at more than 10 years too many years we.

457
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:42,113
Speaker 0: So we went to Kinetic on for a decade plus and we ran the entire panels department like this entire goddamn floor For the better part of a decade and we passed the torch.

458
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,036
Speaker 0: We couldn't do it anymore.

459
00:30:43,117 --> 00:30:44,000
Speaker 0: We weren't there this year.

460
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,549
Speaker 1: I still want to go to Hartford as far away.

461
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:47,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a perfectly good summer weekend.

462
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:57,995
Speaker 0: I got stuff that I do want to return to Kinetic on to do panels again because I actually really like doing panels at Kinetic On but I cannot commit to taking vacation days to doing Kinetic on anymore.

463
00:30:58,516 --> 00:30:59,700
Speaker 0: There's just too many paxes.

464
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,007
Speaker 0: We we do a lot of paxes.

465
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,752
Speaker 0: that really adds up.

466
00:31:03,872 --> 00:31:06,480
Speaker 0: like I can't even deal with pecs dev every year anymore.

467
00:31:07,124 --> 00:31:14,260
Speaker 0: So for the first time in more than 10 years We didn't go to Kinetic on but apparently went fine and we may return to do some panels next year.

468
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:29,420
Speaker 0: But the next convention we will be performing at will be pax West the real tags the convention Like if if we had to drop every other convention we go to this is the last one we would drop.

469
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:33,780
Speaker 0: I think the only thing that'll stop us from being at pax West every year is us dying.

470
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:35,964
Speaker 1: So I'll happen someday.

471
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:38,633
Speaker 0: We will be there doing a panel.

472
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:40,820
Speaker 1: We've done will die first rim or pax West?

473
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:45,836
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you're gonna die before me, but I'm not sure if pax will die before.

474
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:46,760
Speaker 1: I wouldn't bet on that.

475
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:48,980
Speaker 0: I am confident you will die before me.

476
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,226
Speaker 0: You want to bet you want to put.

477
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:52,960
Speaker 0: you want to put some money in like in a state escrow?

478
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,840
Speaker 1: Yes, because if I die, I don't give a shit about money.

479
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,429
Speaker 1: So that's the only way I'll lose.

480
00:31:57,469 --> 00:31:59,359
Speaker 1: the bet is if I'm dead you wanna have a time team.

481
00:32:00,262 --> 00:32:00,804
Speaker 0: Put in $1,000.

482
00:32:00,804 --> 00:32:05,220
Speaker 0: whoever dies first the other person gets it and all the interest.

483
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,833
Speaker 1: No, because then I lose $1,000 now while I'm alive.

484
00:32:07,873 --> 00:32:08,657
Speaker 1: you can take that.

485
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,625
Speaker 0: if you're confident Then I'm gonna die before you.

486
00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:14,120
Speaker 0: you're gonna get $1,000 plus a high-yield investment on that.

487
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:19,200
Speaker 1: No, this bet means I lose $1,000 no matter what I need to basically lose no money.

488
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:22,800
Speaker 1: And then if I die, I still lose nothing, but if you die, then I get money.

489
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,457
Speaker 1: So what you should do is you should buy life insurance on yourself.

490
00:32:26,698 --> 00:32:30,159
Speaker 0: for me I have a substantial life insurance, but it's not going to you.

491
00:32:31,202 --> 00:32:31,829
Speaker 1: that's not fair.

492
00:32:32,213 --> 00:32:36,792
Speaker 0: if you If you give me $1,000, I will also get.

493
00:32:36,812 --> 00:32:40,205
Speaker 0: I'll get like a million dollars for you too Because I'm confident.

494
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:41,569
Speaker 0: I'm I'm pretty confident.

495
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:42,933
Speaker 0: You won't just murder me for the money.

496
00:32:42,953 --> 00:32:44,317
Speaker 1: Mmm a million.

497
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:47,170
Speaker 0: you say yeah I'm pretty sure you won't murder me for that.

498
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:48,718
Speaker 0: Mmm pretty confident.

499
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:51,008
Speaker 0: Also pretty confident you're gonna die before me.

500
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:52,675
Speaker 1: Anyway, I wouldn't have to go to work though.

501
00:32:52,695 --> 00:32:55,727
Speaker 0: I Am so confident you're gonna die before me.

502
00:32:55,747 --> 00:32:57,715
Speaker 0: Mmm, but I digress.

503
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:06,328
Speaker 0: anyone who knows anything about poison Let me know at least one of the panels we're doing at pecs West is the 40 tabletop games You must play which we did in the past.

504
00:33:06,428 --> 00:33:08,277
Speaker 0: We've done versions of this and other cons.

505
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:08,860
Speaker 1: We did it once.

506
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:10,384
Speaker 0: We've done it twice.

507
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:11,067
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

508
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:13,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we've tweaked it a few times.

509
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:14,890
Speaker 0: I'm gonna tweak it a bunch more.

510
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:28,692
Speaker 0: I got some ideas about it But the reason we're doing it here as a repeat as opposed to doing a brand new panel as much as I wanted to do a brand new panel, maybe we'll still do another brand new panel stay tuned, but We're actually doing this one in the streaming

511
00:33:28,752 --> 00:33:29,134
Speaker 1: theater.

512
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:30,040
Speaker 1: for oh my god.

513
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:32,792
Speaker 0: So it's gonna live stream on pecs is twitch.

514
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:33,294
Speaker 1: We got it.

515
00:33:33,314 --> 00:33:34,520
Speaker 1: We got a very bad time.

516
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,132
Speaker 1: Slides the very first panel on Monday morning.

517
00:33:37,152 --> 00:33:38,880
Speaker 1: Yeah when nobody cares.

518
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,540
Speaker 1: But we're in the official pecs one of the official pecs streaming rooms on one of the two or more.

519
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,852
Speaker 1: I don't know how many pecs streaming twitch channels.

520
00:33:47,214 --> 00:33:52,855
Speaker 0: you will be able to see this panel Only things that stream our main theater and the two big panel room.

521
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,340
Speaker 1: So there's three channels three channels.

522
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,204
Speaker 1: So we're probably on.

523
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:55,585
Speaker 1: I imagine.

524
00:33:55,605 --> 00:33:57,453
Speaker 1: I think we're pecs - we're on the third channel.

525
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,160
Speaker 0: We're either pecs two or pecs three.

526
00:33:59,401 --> 00:33:59,603
Speaker 1: Okay,

527
00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:12,739
Speaker 0: we'll have details later But that does mean we're gonna up the production value of the panel a little bit and based on the feedback from the last two Times we ran it it will be different in some ways but parts of it are not gonna change because they're perfect.

528
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,232
Speaker 0: Like I'm not gonna take Dune off the list.

529
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:17,780
Speaker 0: There's a lot to say about Dune.

530
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:25,120
Speaker 0: so yeah, stay tuned and Otherwise, hopefully we'll see you at pecs unplugged pecs out mag fest.

531
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:28,268
Speaker 1: Yeah, I put out a new episode of anime judging.

532
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:32,420
Speaker 0: We judge the summer anime all of it.

533
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,969
Speaker 0: We reviewed it all before it came out.

534
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:40,108
Speaker 0: So if you want to know what anime to watch I'm pretty sure we're right about all these shows.

535
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:43,719
Speaker 1: you trust someone with just going based on gut instinct and almost no knowledge.

536
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:48,411
Speaker 0: I'm actually feeling a lot of the shows like if you watch it minor spoiler.

537
00:34:48,974 --> 00:34:51,300
Speaker 0: We're gonna give a lot of these shows a couple episodes.

538
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:55,627
Speaker 0: We're gonna watch a few of them More so than we have said.

539
00:34:55,647 --> 00:34:57,593
Speaker 0: we'll watch from any season hither to.

540
00:34:57,673 --> 00:35:01,907
Speaker 1: and the book club book is the Odyssey and I should be Able to finish it by Thursday.

541
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,879
Speaker 1: Yes, the Kindle says I only have like a few hours left so I can read.

542
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:07,400
Speaker 0: well I didn't read any the last weekend because I was busy.

543
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:10,419
Speaker 1: It says I can only have a few hours so I can just read it before I go to bed.

544
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:16,100
Speaker 1: And it usually overestimates like usually when it says three hours, it means I'll try to burn through it tonight tomorrow.

545
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:19,100
Speaker 1: I forget how many hours it said but it's single did try to burn through some ready.

546
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,407
Speaker 0: So third so most likely Thursday, we'll talk about the Odyssey.

547
00:35:21,448 --> 00:35:22,732
Speaker 0: So read the fucking Odyssey.

548
00:35:23,093 --> 00:35:24,437
Speaker 0: It's a really important story.

549
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:25,260
Speaker 0: new translation.

550
00:35:26,484 --> 00:35:26,849
Speaker 1: What's your name?

00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:27,640
Speaker 0: Emily Wilson?

552
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, also follow her on Twitter because when she talks about the Odyssey on Twitter, holy shit, is it great?

553
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:48,797
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and if you live anywhere in like the New York area and you are a biker Or even if you're not a biker, but you bike sometimes like if you could bike 10 or 20 miles But if you can bike you can bike 10 or 20 miles.

554
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,928
Speaker 1: You just don't think you can but you totally can.

555
00:35:51,008 --> 00:36:03,820
Speaker 0: Yes, unless you're like really older and firmer have a problem But you could bike 10 or 20 miles where there's like rest stops Cars like following everyone to help you out if there's a problem and you have many hours to do it.

556
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:11,832
Speaker 1: Right, even if you go slow as balls, right as slow as my mom You will make 20-something miles in like what 10 hours, but you'll make it.

557
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:16,367
Speaker 0: So this weekend the Harlan Valley rail ride is Super goddamn fun.

558

Speaker 1: There are tons of bike rides all over the place, right?

559

00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,376
Speaker 0: The pub G didn't come out when we were in college.

574
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:19,968
Speaker 1: Yes I didn't pay a lot, you know, I didn't play it right away because it was like this early access game That was getting huge.

575
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,080
Speaker 1: It was number one on Steam.

576
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:28,780
Speaker 1: it was the biggest deal ever and I just didn't get into it because it was 50 bucks and I didn't have time to get into it.

577
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:34,502
Speaker 0: It was I wanted to play it and money wasn't even an object It was just.

578
00:37:34,562 --> 00:37:38,700
Speaker 0: I knew I did not have time to commit to it because pub G the best way to describe it.

579
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,360
Speaker 0: If you don't know anything about player unknown battlegrounds, it's the hard more.

580
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,007
Speaker 0: It's the hard mode version of fortnight, right?

581
00:37:46,027 --> 00:37:50,500
Speaker 0: Even though really fortnight is the ripoff tf2 of pub G, right?

582
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:58,616
Speaker 1: So if you don't know it's an FPS and the way it works is a whole bunch of people get thrown onto a map Which is a giant giant map and between 90 and 100 people.

583
00:37:58,716 --> 00:38:13,704
Speaker 1: It's an island Yeah, and you basically go around collecting, you know armor weapons ammo vehicles Whatever you need and then when you meet people you fucking murder them or be murdered by them and the last person alive is the winner And they get the chicken dinner.

584
00:38:13,784 --> 00:38:13,985
Speaker 1: Yep.

585
00:38:14,246 --> 00:38:18,880
Speaker 1: So here's the deal the man just like battle royale the movie only with less people more people.

586
00:38:19,202 --> 00:38:22,320
Speaker 0: So the the things that made the important points about this game or that one.

587
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:28,460
Speaker 0: This is an old school FPS, this is one of those old school.

588
00:38:29,444 --> 00:38:30,026
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

589
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:30,648
Speaker 0: old school that?

590
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:33,600
Speaker 1: so your old school is quake where everything's fast, right?

591
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,664
Speaker 0: This is not the.

592
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:37,594
Speaker 0: that's not the aspect of old school because there were slow.

593
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:39,260
Speaker 0: FPS is back then too, right?

594
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,760
Speaker 1: But those have been like the old FPS like that were like maps or mazes.

595
00:38:43,702 --> 00:38:45,760
Speaker 1: This is one of those is a military fan.

596
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:51,485
Speaker 0: This is This is our school mod type.

597
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:59,996
Speaker 0: FPS is because old-school mods of FPS is Like those quake one and quake two mods and make it TF and all that nonsense.

598
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:04,309
Speaker 0: They were Characterized by having a million fucking buttons.

599
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:06,576
Speaker 0: You could bind to a million different complicated.

600
00:39:06,616 --> 00:39:07,900
Speaker 1: It doesn't have that many it.

601
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:08,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

602
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:09,147
Speaker 0: You just don't know.

603
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,836
Speaker 1: this is just a military fanboy.

604
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:11,379
Speaker 1: FPS.

605
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:17,775
Speaker 1: People cared about realistic weapon stuff and you know actual.

606
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:30,660
Speaker 0: but instead of a hit scan bullets they're actually like ballistic and they have TV, but But Eventually, you'll you're gonna start looking up the keys to hit to do complicated things.

607
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,838
Speaker 0: You didn't even know you could do like change how the sights work on a gun.

608
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,166
Speaker 0: Yep Like you can hold you can bind a key.

609
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:43,260
Speaker 0: like you can crouch you can lay prone you can crawl you can lean.

610
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:44,124
Speaker 0: I don't lean yet.

611
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:45,369
Speaker 0: I feel like I should start leaning.

612
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:46,333
Speaker 1: leaning is pretty important.

613
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:47,417
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't lean at all.

614
00:39:47,457 --> 00:39:48,020
Speaker 0: It's a problem.

615
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:49,764
Speaker 0: It's got melee.

616
00:39:49,784 --> 00:39:50,948
Speaker 0: It's got all sorts of nonsense.

617
00:39:50,968 --> 00:39:59,301
Speaker 0: There's a lot of buttons and a lot of stuff to Learn before you can actually be good at it at all like.

618
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:08,552
Speaker 0: so on one hand it's like counter-stroke semi realistic weapons and Like super dead like one bullet will pretty much just take you out.

619
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:09,715
Speaker 1: sort of it has.

620
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:10,276
Speaker 1: that's one of the.

621
00:40:10,697 --> 00:40:11,519
Speaker 1: it's weird great cuz.

622
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,266
Speaker 1: Fundamentally, right.

623
00:40:13,306 --> 00:40:15,760
Speaker 1: and if you look at the big picture of this game, right?

624
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:29,633
Speaker 1: I love it and I knew I would write which is why I played it eat when it went on sale After we and especially, you know the seeing the the maker the creator of the game at the PAX East keynote reaffirmed like alright Yes, everything I thought about this game was correct.

625
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:31,260
Speaker 0: I would know was great.

626
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,700
Speaker 0: He's really smart and he talked a lot about like why he made this game, right?

627
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,140
Speaker 1: But so on the big picture of the game, everything is like totally awesome.

628
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,189
Speaker 1: Right you parachute onto this island.

629
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,595
Speaker 1: the parachuting is way fun.

630
00:40:41,635 --> 00:40:44,628
Speaker 1: It's one of the only things I'm okay Especially cuz like I only mess up.

631
00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:47,460
Speaker 1: I only mess up if it's a parachute really far away from the plane.

632
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:56,770
Speaker 0: But then you look around and you're like, oh good I'm by myself or sometimes you're parachuting and you see like a bunch of other people parachuting Well, I've been playing I've been playing squad only I stopped playing by myself.

633
00:40:57,432 --> 00:40:58,917
Speaker 1: I like myself is lame.

634
00:40:59,037 --> 00:40:59,980
Speaker 0: I like playing by myself.

635
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:07,780
Speaker 1: I also like playing with squads and self is lame Anyway, but then right you you go around and collect stuff and it's all like you're exploring this map.

636
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,863
Speaker 1: It's all kinds of fun.

637
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:09,786
Speaker 1: You're collecting loot.

638
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:14,600
Speaker 1: You're you know, getting better weapons reload configuring your guns, you know, that's way fun.

639
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,088
Speaker 1: Especially it's like this.

640
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:17,073
Speaker 1: it's big.

641
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:18,400
Speaker 1: It's like it's so big.

642
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:26,080
Speaker 0: You've got this like for example of the maps that desert map like if you don't get our car Like you just can't get to the other side of the map.

643
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:38,293
Speaker 1: Not only is it big but like you go to a building this buildings and like multiple stories with like tons of rooms in them It's like yes, like like like it's it's hyper realistic.

644
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,880
Speaker 1: one building in this game will be as big as like a whole counter-strike.

645
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:43,684
Speaker 0: yeah, so Imagine like that.

646
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:45,450
Speaker 0: that feeling alone is really fun.

647
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,136
Speaker 1: Like this is bigger than tribes.

648
00:41:47,196 --> 00:41:48,280
Speaker 1: tribes isn't isn't even big.

649
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:50,310
Speaker 0: You're thinking about your strategy.

650
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,719
Speaker 0: Like should I go ahead?

651
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,705
Speaker 1: Tribes of the pub G mode.

652
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:54,992
Speaker 0: Should I go ahead for that city?

653
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:56,580
Speaker 0: There's probably a lot of people there.

654
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:58,168
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll just cut through the woods.

655
00:41:58,188 --> 00:41:59,073
Speaker 1: better loot there though.

656
00:41:59,696 --> 00:42:03,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll cut through the woods I won't find any loot, but this is a weird remote part of the map.

657
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,428
Speaker 0: There's gonna be no one out here or I'm literally.

658
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:09,939
Speaker 0: just I land on this island by myself and get a jet ski and leave the Island when I'm ready.

659
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:16,543
Speaker 1: Anyway, so then there's a circle that appears and the circle is what makes it interesting because there's only a few maps Right ones.

660
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:18,030
Speaker 1: the new one is like a small one.

661
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,240
Speaker 0: Well, the two and there's two things that are important here.

662
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,779
Speaker 0: There's one there's the circle and there's the random plane route rival that.

663
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:32,705
Speaker 1: Yeah So the the the the the flight that everyone jumps off of with a parachute is different every time and it's hard to fly far Away from the plane in your parachute.

664
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:35,775
Speaker 1: So people start in generally along that line.

665
00:42:35,795 --> 00:42:36,397
Speaker 0: that starts.

666
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:42,680
Speaker 0: you look at the map there's a hundred people with you on the plane and You decide when are you going to jump off the plane?

667
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:50,660
Speaker 0: and when you're on the plane You'll see like a seating chart and you'll see people disappear as they jump off the plane.

668
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it goes over the military base a million people.

669
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:56,280
Speaker 1: So the starting distribution of players is different every time.

670
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's more dense along the line more dense in the in the cities with lots of loot.

671
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:01,660
Speaker 0: Yeah.

672
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:09,102
Speaker 1: And then there's a circle that appears once you're on the ground and if you're outside that circle when the time runs out Then it these.

673
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:17,872
Speaker 1: this electric fence that's like virtual electric fence will come in and if you're outside of that circle when the fence Comes in you start taking damage and eventually die.

674
00:43:18,093 --> 00:43:25,576
Speaker 1: the circle appears in a random location and then it gets smaller and smaller and smaller at intervals and those inner those smaller.

675
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:28,717
Speaker 0: each one of those is also in a Random location within the current circle.

676
00:43:28,778 --> 00:43:35,019
Speaker 1: Yes So basically the game is different every time even though it's on the same enormous map because a the map is enormous.

677
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:41,180
Speaker 1: B You're starting in a different place and see the circles are different which shows like as the game goes on It's like alright.

678
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:47,519
Speaker 1: Well, the game is ending this time like in the water or on a bridge and then this this time the game is like everyone's.

679
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:56,764
Speaker 1: You know coalescing around this building or this, you know This this, you know Maybe big city the game ends on or just in the woods is what happens most of the time Right?

680
00:43:56,784 --> 00:44:00,259
Speaker 1: or this rock formation and that really changes how the game goes.

681
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:05,240
Speaker 1: Based on the terrain that everyone's being forced into at least the survivors are forced.

682
00:44:06,441 --> 00:44:12,638
Speaker 0: Now at close and moderate range like in a firefight, it's very counter-strike II in terms of the skills.

683
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:20,296
Speaker 0: Yep but The firefight because counter-strike as a game Starts at the point the firefight broke out.

684
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:24,610
Speaker 1: basically You're already you're like you're already really close to someone.

685
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:29,759
Speaker 1: like even if you just spawn in counter-strike and you're both at your spawn points You are hella close.

686
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,790
Speaker 1: Yeah If you're that close in pub G like you're gonna die.

687
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:37,116
Speaker 0: like pub G is a game where like you're walking through the woods you Hear one gunshot in the distance.

688
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:40,025
Speaker 0: You're like Where's that?

689
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:41,634
Speaker 1: Yep, it's going on.

690
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:52,687
Speaker 0: Someone's nearby Hey They'll be here soon Like you hear a bunch of gunfire and like some people play like scavengers like to hear a bunch of gunfire and this are creeping In to catch someone looting like that.

691
00:44:52,947 --> 00:45:04,867
Speaker 0: There's a lot of dynamics, but the real strategies in the game come down more to things like real world overland movement and like really realistic Technics seeing someone else before.

692
00:45:04,907 --> 00:45:08,500
Speaker 0: they say you matters way more than your counter-strike head clicking skills.

693
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:16,664
Speaker 1: Yep I mean You know the people will do stuff like they'll they'll stay inside the wall as it comes in and then they'll aim Outwards.

694
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:18,272
Speaker 1: Yeah, and because they know

695
00:45:18,352 --> 00:45:20,461
Speaker 0: a lot of kills by being along a road They know

696
00:45:20,502 --> 00:45:29,989
Speaker 1: that people are coming from that city and if because they're they have to run that those people didn't make it to the Circle in time they're coming in from that general direction Will shoot them as they come in.

697
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:36,317
Speaker 1: my favorite thing that ever happened is Another strategy is oh, we know people are gonna camp there to shoot people as they come in.

698
00:45:36,357 --> 00:45:39,390
Speaker 1: Let's go shoot them Yep, or in the back because they're looking outward.

699
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:41,760
Speaker 0: There's a fire watchtower up there and it's in a good spot.

700
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,680
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure someone's camping up there doing what we just described.

701
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:48,836
Speaker 0: Let's toss a little grenade up there and I hear it explode and someone's just dead.

702
00:45:49,217 --> 00:45:49,639
Speaker 0: good game.

703
00:45:50,113 --> 00:45:56,884
Speaker 1: Yeah There are how many times I've been like in a building and I'm pretty sure no one knows I'm in here as I haven't moved Or made any noise.

704
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,591
Speaker 1: Yeah, a grenade comes in the window.

705
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:13,100
Speaker 1: It's like well, all right, so Do I attempt to run revealing that I'm in here and then go out run out the front door where I will be shot or Do I like try to sit here and survive the grenade?

706
00:46:15,263 --> 00:46:22,052
Speaker 1: Even if I survive the grenade, I'm now damaged and they come in and shoot me Even though maybe I can get some shots on them that way.

707
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:24,140
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's like that kind of thing.

708
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:29,196
Speaker 0: Yep, so it means the game is really more about things like literally managing your time.

709
00:46:29,216 --> 00:46:30,340
Speaker 1: Can you pick up a grenade and throw it back?

710
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:31,823
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

711
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:33,209
Speaker 0: I don't in kind.

712
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:37,926
Speaker 0: It's pretty rare that I get a grenade thrown at me So I haven't really Interacted with them in that level.

713
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:40,377
Speaker 1: It happened to me a lot when I would just camp in houses.

714
00:46:40,437 --> 00:46:42,134
Speaker 1: now that I run around It doesn't happen as much.

715
00:46:43,102 --> 00:46:53,780
Speaker 0: But so that they like threat assessment like you're driving along the road and you see some houses up in the distance Like you got to think about what if someone's in that building will they do anything to me?

716
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,843
Speaker 0: Do they care?

717
00:46:54,863 --> 00:46:57,954
Speaker 0: or they just because they're just just as afraid of me as I am of them?

718
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,058
Speaker 0: probably well not.

719
00:46:59,078 --> 00:46:59,781
Speaker 1: if they're good They're.

720
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:00,484
Speaker 0: yeah, it depends.

721
00:47:00,524 --> 00:47:04,340
Speaker 1: But I feel like the good players are going around hunting everyone and aren't afraid at all.

722
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm basically afraid of everybody.

723
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:09,480
Speaker 0: I'm trying to hunt people more and I'm having fun with that.

724
00:47:09,681 --> 00:47:13,860
Speaker 1: I've been playing in squads more because then when I get in a squad with good people they carry me.

725
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:17,940
Speaker 0: But you're thinking of things like so I got to get inside the circle.

726
00:47:18,443 --> 00:47:19,227
Speaker 0: Where do I go?

727
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:20,494
Speaker 0: Like you're pulling off the map.

728
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:25,857
Speaker 0: if you're playing with a squad Usually like someone's got the map up like and picking waypoints like alright, we're gonna head here.

729
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:26,440
Speaker 0: We're gonna head here.

730
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,574
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone else is like covering teams.

731
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:30,157
Speaker 1: That's the team.

732
00:47:30,197 --> 00:47:30,840
Speaker 1: stuff is so fun.

733
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,987
Speaker 1: You can put waypoints on the map and then your friends can see that on their map and you can sort of you know Communicate really nicely.

734
00:47:37,027 --> 00:47:37,650
Speaker 0: So let's talk about that.

735
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:38,675
Speaker 0: There's there's a couple.

736
00:47:38,716 --> 00:47:39,560
Speaker 0: there's a few ways to play.

737
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,713
Speaker 0: There's a third person mode, but fuck that noise.

738
00:47:41,773 --> 00:47:42,880
Speaker 0: No, don't play third person.

739
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,879
Speaker 1: I've heard the third person is like the the way to win.

740
00:47:46,622 --> 00:47:50,736
Speaker 1: But at least they keep the third people their third person perspective people separate from the first person.

741
00:47:50,776 --> 00:47:51,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I tried it.

742
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:52,684
Speaker 0: It's not fun.

743
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,052
Speaker 0: It just feels really I didn't even try it.

744
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,380
Speaker 0: It's really not fun.

745
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:00,437
Speaker 0: I'm only an FPS person but so you can play solo which is fun in its own way.

746
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:02,143
Speaker 0: It's just Hundred people.

747
00:48:02,483 --> 00:48:03,446
Speaker 0: last man solo.

748
00:48:03,466 --> 00:48:04,970
Speaker 1: I think is more fun if you're actually good.

749
00:48:05,472 --> 00:48:06,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's very.

750
00:48:06,855 --> 00:48:08,620
Speaker 1: it's very unnerving cuz you're just alone.

751
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:16,380
Speaker 1: It's a good way to learn sort of basic skills like no I didn't learn a lot doing solo cuz I just died.

752
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:19,960
Speaker 1: And but when I played in a team people could tell me stuff and would give me pointers.

753
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:20,945
Speaker 1: I just have some wiki's.

754
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:22,995
Speaker 0: I started playing solo and I started getting like.

755
00:48:23,056 --> 00:48:26,901
Speaker 0: I'm not saying I'm good But I can usually make it to the last 10 or 15.

756
00:48:26,901 --> 00:48:30,095
Speaker 1: Oh, I can make it to the last but not really I make it there.

757
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:36,233
Speaker 0: I don't just hide I kill a few people on the way and I take risks.

758
00:48:36,815 --> 00:48:37,780
Speaker 0: I take a lot of risks.

759
00:48:39,062 --> 00:48:40,312
Speaker 0: The game's not fun if you don't take risks.

760
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:41,964
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I mean, what do you want?

761
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:43,755
Speaker 1: you're playing a game and what do you spend your time?

762
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:44,580
Speaker 1: crouched in the closet?

763
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,427
Speaker 1: And then you die that way.

764
00:48:46,447 --> 00:48:49,100
Speaker 1: What did you just do for 20 minutes when I'm getting really close?

765
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,613
Speaker 0: What was the point like one time?

766
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:51,299
Speaker 1: How is that fun?

767
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,660
Speaker 0: There are only five other people left alive and the circle is getting real small.

768
00:48:55,082 --> 00:48:58,740
Speaker 0: So I was in the second story of a building that was right on the edge of the circle.

769
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:00,105
Speaker 0: I just hit up there prone.

770
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:04,320
Speaker 0: I'm fucking gonna move and I was just gonna hope and hope and grenade came in through the window.

771
00:49:04,501 --> 00:49:05,647
Speaker 1: Yep, that was the enemy.

772
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:06,974
Speaker 1: That's how would you camp in the building?

773
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:07,818
Speaker 1: grenade comes in the wind?

774
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:11,720
Speaker 0: Nope But you can also play two player like duo squad.

775
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:12,905
Speaker 1: You can do two people.

776
00:49:12,945 --> 00:49:16,440
Speaker 1: you can do three four two people is the default Scott and I stream two people.

777
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,505
Speaker 0: That's pretty fun.

778
00:49:17,886 --> 00:49:19,453
Speaker 0: Cuz it's very like you.

779
00:49:19,634 --> 00:49:31,961
Speaker 0: like you can do basic Simple tactics like I'll cover the windows on this building while you go in or I'll look at the map While you're covering me like that kind of stuff before people's really where it's at It's.

780
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:35,860
Speaker 1: it's just great to have four people, you know, you don't get outnumbered by some bigger squad.

781
00:49:36,522 --> 00:49:37,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, four people is.

782
00:49:37,988 --> 00:49:39,896
Speaker 0: I've only played four people a few times.

783
00:49:39,956 --> 00:49:40,940
Speaker 0: it's real fun.

784
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,144
Speaker 1: I play four people the most.

785
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:46,963
Speaker 1: once I once I realized you don't actually need I thought at first I thought you needed to bring Three friends.

786
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:47,926
Speaker 0: Oh, no, you can join.

787
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:50,015
Speaker 1: you can just join a random group of four people.

788
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:56,733
Speaker 0: once I learned that that's all I do Yep, but it's four people is especially fun when you play with friends Because four people like you could.

789
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:58,143
Speaker 0: you're on voice chat You're just playing.

790
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:01,560
Speaker 1: it's fun when you play with friends or you randomly get put with people are actually good.

791
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:06,999
Speaker 1: But I actually was worried I'd get put with like shitheads from the internet But that actually hasn't happened.

792
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,367
Speaker 1: I've usually been with like good people.

793
00:50:11,387 --> 00:50:12,952
Speaker 1: I haven't had any awful experiences.

794
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:13,956
Speaker 1: But then again, I'm a dude.

795
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:15,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true I have.

796
00:50:16,002 --> 00:50:21,397
Speaker 0: I think part of that is that there is a pretty high barrier to entry for this game.

797
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:27,937
Speaker 0: like Imagine if you'd never played like counter-strike or like those kinds of games and you'd never played.

798
00:50:27,957 --> 00:50:32,412
Speaker 0: those are made like Super realistic games and you've only ever played like Call of Duty.

799
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,600
Speaker 0: You're fucked if you try to play this game.

800
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you're not gonna have a good time.

801
00:50:37,129 --> 00:50:47,943
Speaker 1: So I mean, you know the it's not necessarily a negative But the only negative things I see in this game is simply that a I don't like the military, you know realism stuff I do.

802
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:49,671
Speaker 1: I I just like.

803
00:50:49,872 --> 00:50:50,394
Speaker 1: I like more.

804
00:50:50,414 --> 00:51:02,610
Speaker 1: I don't want it to be so Simple and arcade II like it's Team Fortress 2 But I like the counter-strike level of the way weapons work where I don't want to have to adjust the sides And worry about this ballistic shit.

805
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,540
Speaker 1: It's like if I click on someone I should shoot them, right?

806
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,022
Speaker 1: It's like come on.

807
00:51:05,483 --> 00:51:07,410
Speaker 0: So I like that realism.

808
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,735
Speaker 1: I mean, I understand it.

809
00:51:08,855 --> 00:51:10,160
Speaker 1: I understand that other people like it.

810
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,308
Speaker 1: It's just a matter of taste, but it is not.

811
00:51:12,368 --> 00:51:13,553
Speaker 1: it is not my preference.

812
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:15,259
Speaker 0: Here's the reason why it needs to be that way.

813
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:27,140
Speaker 0: in counter-strike the sniper rifles were Way too dangerous and the only reason they worked is because you can't get that far away from people.

814
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:34,374
Speaker 0: I think it would be cool if they just a counter-strike style AWM in this game Where you could just click and it'll always kill the person.

815
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:35,500
Speaker 1: I think it would be cool.

816
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,648
Speaker 1: Just don't have sniper rifles scopes.

817
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:43,616
Speaker 1: You can see but no guns that are actually any accurate at that range like the fact that sniper rifle exists.

818
00:51:43,636 --> 00:52:04,604
Speaker 0: because Sniping like you can interact with this game in very different ways but you can't necessarily specialize because Every game is so different that even if you get wanna snipe like sniping is really fun or interacting with snipers is really fun like sometimes like a sniper takes a potshot at me and misses and then it's a game of Me trying to

819
00:52:05,106 --> 00:52:06,169
Speaker 1: figure out where the hell they are figure

820
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:11,185
Speaker 0: out where they are serpentine get out of sight like get over a ridge And then it's not like.

821
00:52:11,205 --> 00:52:12,168
Speaker 0: now I gotta go kill them.

822
00:52:12,249 --> 00:52:14,094
Speaker 0: It's well, I got away from the sniper.

823
00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:15,037
Speaker 0: Good luck.

824
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:15,860
Speaker 0: Have fun sniper.

825
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:17,758
Speaker 0: I will probably never encounter you again.

826
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:25,724
Speaker 1: You know this stuff going on there, but you know, I just you know, the the realistic weapon shit is not for me Military fanboys.

827
00:52:25,764 --> 00:52:26,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I also like.

828
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:29,034
Speaker 0: so there's where there's so much of this game like vehicles.

829
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:31,295
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the maps are so vehicles are just fine.

830
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:38,119
Speaker 0: So you can literally like get in a car and drive it around with your friends or like a jet ski.

831
00:52:39,101 --> 00:52:40,004
Speaker 0: There's all like.

832
00:52:40,044 --> 00:52:41,369
Speaker 0: there's so many different vehicles.

833
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,237
Speaker 1: The other thing is like the inventory stuff.

834
00:52:43,357 --> 00:52:44,120
Speaker 1: It's like it's alright.

835
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,720
Speaker 1: You need to have some amount of inventory thing because part of the game is about going and getting loot and like upgrading your weapons.

836
00:52:49,961 --> 00:53:00,220
Speaker 1: Stuff right, but so, you know, it's a. it's just like the complexity of it is just like one smidge too much Right to where it's like, oh you got to have the right bullets for that gun.

837
00:53:00,301 --> 00:53:04,488
Speaker 1: I like that and then you have to remember Which bullets go with the wedge gun.

838
00:53:04,508 --> 00:53:12,672
Speaker 0: they don't help you out if you're holding away if you're holding a weapon if you have one Then it shows a silhouette of the weapon when you look at the thing on the ground.

839
00:53:13,174 --> 00:53:17,691
Speaker 1: It's not it's it's still Bit I can't?

840
00:53:17,732 --> 00:53:18,419
Speaker 1: I don't even know that.

841
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,202
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I don't even know what the hell Like.

842
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,830
Speaker 1: what gun do I'm even holding right?

843
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,800
Speaker 1: It's like you have to be a military fan boy to know.

844
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:32,660
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm holding the with the tele m4 apart from an M16 and know what kind of ammo they take.

845
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:36,220
Speaker 0: It's like if you don't know that stuff Which is weird that I know some of that stuff.

846
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:40,619
Speaker 0: The easy way is if it shows a silhouette pick it up one of your guns uses it.

847
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:42,066
Speaker 1: Yes, I'd even notice.

848
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:44,980
Speaker 0: but anyway, the point is but I like that element because here's a counterpoint.

849
00:53:45,261 --> 00:53:46,105
Speaker 0: You can't pause the game.

850
00:53:46,466 --> 00:53:47,410
Speaker 0: It's pub G. It's live.

851
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:47,973
Speaker 0: You're just going.

852
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:56,723
Speaker 0: yeah, so like the real world Imagine if you literally were pet teleported like jumped out of a plane naked into a town You've never been to.

853
00:53:57,104 --> 00:53:57,966
Speaker 0: ran into a house.

854
00:53:58,207 --> 00:54:02,240
Speaker 0: you hear gunfire outside and on the ground is a pile of guns and bullets.

855
00:54:02,933 --> 00:54:09,230
Speaker 0: you gotta really balance your time between Carefully picking up the right things you want versus.

856
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:11,680
Speaker 0: grab a bunch of shit get somewhere safe figure it out later.

857
00:54:12,102 --> 00:54:13,631
Speaker 0: I like that aspect a lot.

858
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:18,232
Speaker 0: I've been killed a couple times Fucking around in my inventory when I thought I was safe.

859
00:54:18,794 --> 00:54:20,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, that happens often, right?

860
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,160
Speaker 0: I do like, you know getting killed fucking around your inventory watching someone else kill someone wait for them to go loot the body.

861
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,184
Speaker 0: There is there fucking.

862
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:32,864
Speaker 1: there's still ways you can keep that aspect without Of oh my god.

863
00:54:32,884 --> 00:54:33,226
Speaker 1: I'm fuck your.

864
00:54:33,266 --> 00:54:33,868
Speaker 1: I'm inventory.

865
00:54:33,888 --> 00:54:38,627
Speaker 1: while I was shot without having to be a military fan boy I know which ammo goes with which gun.

866
00:54:38,647 --> 00:54:39,290
Speaker 0: you don't need to.

867
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,610
Speaker 0: the game literally just tells you it's not Super-elegant.

868
00:54:43,177 --> 00:54:44,967
Speaker 0: I think It's not super-elegant or obvious.

869
00:54:47,983 --> 00:54:53,911
Speaker 0: I think the way they did is actually pretty elegant because it keeps the realism But it gives you very clear and say right as you can.

870
00:54:53,992 --> 00:54:55,960
Speaker 1: I'm saying get rid of the realism fuck realism.

871
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,946
Speaker 1: But I don't give a shit about.

872
00:54:56,966 --> 00:54:58,495
Speaker 0: yeah, you just want to be some fortnight.

873
00:54:58,535 --> 00:54:59,340
Speaker 0: kid is what you want.

874
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,164
Speaker 1: No, I don't.

875
00:55:00,445 --> 00:55:01,651
Speaker 1: that's too stupid a game.

876
00:55:02,113 --> 00:55:03,440
Speaker 1: I need to be counter-strike level.

877
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,160
Speaker 1: We're just I you know, let me pick up the ammo like quake where I shouldn't have to touch.

878
00:55:08,164 --> 00:55:11,719
Speaker 1: You played counter-strike At least a year ago.

879
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,106
Speaker 0: No, I still play counter-strike.

880
00:55:15,283 --> 00:55:22,312
Speaker 1: I want to play counter-strike where I parachute out of a big plane Onto a giant map and then I play counter-strike and only one person survives.

881
00:55:22,613 --> 00:55:23,134
Speaker 0: Yeah.

882
00:55:23,275 --> 00:55:23,836
Speaker 0: Anyway, I like.

883
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:25,120
Speaker 0: I like pub G a lot.

884
00:55:25,384 --> 00:55:26,641
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, it's great It's so.

885
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:34,489
Speaker 0: here's the other things are important about this game because of all the factors we talked about Irrespective of Scott's complaints about the military fanboy.

886
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:34,951
Speaker 0: It's nice.

887
00:55:34,971 --> 00:55:36,777
Speaker 1: Just I don't you know, it's not bad.

888
00:55:36,838 --> 00:55:37,460
Speaker 1: They do a good job.

889
00:55:37,988 --> 00:55:43,111
Speaker 1: That's not for me but I still play the game because all the other parts outweigh that one thing.

890
00:55:43,331 --> 00:55:49,471
Speaker 0: like everything's pretty tight and there's a Lot of complexity that you don't have to engage with.

891
00:55:49,491 --> 00:55:52,023
Speaker 0: if you really don't want to like well You're not gonna win.

892
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,680
Speaker 0: if you don't you'll you'll do well, but I'm not gonna win it.

893
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,290
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna win anyway, so it doesn't matter.

894
00:55:56,732 --> 00:56:02,299
Speaker 0: but I guess it's a game where Losing and winning are pretty much equally fun.

895
00:56:02,782 --> 00:56:10,740
Speaker 0: Once you get above the point of you just die immediately and don't know why naked in the wilderness Like once you get past that point losing at this game is actually super fun.

896
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't really don't give a shit about like.

897
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:14,600
Speaker 1: I've never won and I don't really care, right?

898
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,431
Speaker 1: It's like encounter strike if you just keep losing and losing and losing.

899
00:56:17,471 --> 00:56:23,924
Speaker 1: eventually you want to quit and find a different team and pub Gee, I expect to lose I lose and I don't care I just keep playing the.

900
00:56:24,025 --> 00:56:35,020
Speaker 0: the emergent stories the emergent gameplay the narratives of winning and losing like this game is Such a triumph in that regard like literally every game of this I play is

901
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,846
Speaker 1: Completely different from every other

902
00:56:36,887 --> 00:56:50,800
Speaker 0: has at least one story to where like if I'm hanging out with people who have also played pub G I can tell the story and it's usually funny or interesting in some way and Not many games can generate that consistent level of interesting stories.

903
00:56:51,524 --> 00:56:58,504
Speaker 1: I mean the only games that don't really have much of a story are the ones where you Land in the hotbed area and die right away Yeah Or occasionally.

904
00:56:58,524 --> 00:57:03,677
Speaker 1: but if you I've landed in a hotbed area and not died right away and then a good game happens Yep.

905
00:57:03,981 --> 00:57:09,983
Speaker 1: And the other thing is like you plan and then you won't even realize like you just playing and playing and playing Oh

906
00:57:10,245 --> 00:57:11,090
Speaker 0: shit, there's only ten people

907
00:57:11,151 --> 00:57:17,256
Speaker 1: and then it's like oh my god Look how small that fucking circle is and you don't even realize that like you're now entering the danger zone

908
00:57:17,577 --> 00:57:18,359
Speaker 0: or cuz you're like like.

909
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:25,928
Speaker 0: Well, I had one game where it's just so happened that The circle was basically following me So I was basically always in the center of the circle.

910
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:35,540
Speaker 1: that circle is what even though you're on the same map doing the same Exact thing with you over and over again the random circle of the random plane flight change the game so much.

911
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:39,660
Speaker 1: Every time is completely different and it's like relative to where you happen to land, right?

912
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,520
Speaker 1: It's like even though you know, you get different circle every time but your landing spot is different.

913
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,468
Speaker 1: Maybe the circle keeps focusing on you.

914
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:47,275
Speaker 1: You don't move around a lot that game.

915
00:57:47,315 --> 00:57:52,290
Speaker 0: You just start us chill out Like close range weapons and you hole up somewhere right.

916
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,774
Speaker 0: grenades can't get into the window.

917
00:57:53,835 --> 00:57:54,898
Speaker 1: some other game you play.

918
00:57:54,978 --> 00:58:00,220
Speaker 1: the circle appears Real far away from you and now your whole game is like this journey to get over there without dying.

919
00:58:00,423 --> 00:58:02,284
Speaker 0: Now your game is like, oh fuck I need a car.

920
00:58:02,304 --> 00:58:09,244
Speaker 0: like you see a car coming down the road and like Brigands you try to like fucking kill the people in the car and steal it Right.

921
00:58:09,545 --> 00:58:10,792
Speaker 1: Your car can run out of gas.

922
00:58:10,832 --> 00:58:12,299
Speaker 1: You gotta get more gas for it.

923
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,566
Speaker 0: My so I was.

924
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:16,220
Speaker 0: this was like one of them of the most fun I ever had.

925
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:23,714
Speaker 0: I was playing solo and I was in a big desert map and like the circle just started on the like I started on the edge Of the map and the circle was the opposite side.

926
00:58:24,056 --> 00:58:26,345
Speaker 0: like I'm fucked there's no cars or anything near me.

927
00:58:26,866 --> 00:58:39,739
Speaker 0: and then a car from a little bit even further away to the north comes driving by on the road and I see the car coming and I take some potshots and rather than just ignore me dude stops and gets out of the car.

928
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,568
Speaker 0: Why so?

929
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:42,899
Speaker 0: and he comes after me.

930
00:58:43,281 --> 00:58:48,602
Speaker 0: So I just sneak out of the building and like sneak all the way around and get to the car and I see why he Got out of it.

931
00:58:49,004 --> 00:58:50,149
Speaker 0: It was mostly out of gas.

932
00:58:50,772 --> 00:58:52,599
Speaker 0: I had a gas can I filled it up?

933
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:53,725
Speaker 0: I drove

934
00:58:53,785 --> 00:58:54,268
Speaker 1: away and

935
00:58:54,891 --> 00:59:08,600
Speaker 0: just as I get in the car and start driving away I hear a machine gun open up and the dude is in the window of the building clearly panicking Because the fact that I got his car means there's no way he will make it to the circle and I basically killed him.

936
00:59:09,525 --> 00:59:10,360
Speaker 0: That was so fun.

937
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,280
Speaker 0: Like the bullets are bouncing off the back of the car and I'm just trying to get away and I totally got away.

938
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,106
Speaker 1: Yep, crazy shit like that happens.

939
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:20,180
Speaker 1: It's like epic stories like every single time you play and live for more than 10 seconds.

940
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:25,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is why you know, it's like, alright, I'll put up with some military fanboyism for that.

941
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,102
Speaker 1: I guess it's not.

942
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:29,233
Speaker 1: it's not the most extreme military fanboyism I've seen.

943
00:59:29,514 --> 00:59:33,268
Speaker 0: so if you if you're okay at the game Games last you in 10 and 20 minutes.

944
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,157
Speaker 0: Like that's about how long you're in there.

945
00:59:35,177 --> 00:59:41,860
Speaker 1: Yep If you're when your first star and the thing is you don't have to chill out while the game finishes You can just leave and join a new one.

946
00:59:42,063 --> 00:59:44,114
Speaker 0: basically when you die You have two options.

947
00:59:44,154 --> 00:59:51,785
Speaker 0: you can either Start spectating and like watch the person who killed you and see if they make it because I did that a couple times or watch The rest of your team if they're still alive.

948
00:59:52,187 --> 01:00:15,340
Speaker 0: It's real satisfying when like you get killed and you feel salty about it but then you see that the person you killed who killed you is Like a super expert who goes on to win the entire thing and you were just one of many That they took out or you can watch the death cam and it shows all the Context that led up to your death like the person who killed you and it's way earlier in the timeline than you might expect.

949
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,040
Speaker 1: I think it's like 30 seconds before you died or something is some amount of time.

950
01:00:19,381 --> 01:00:24,658
Speaker 1: It shows the person who killed you for their perspective for like X seconds up until the point you died.

951
01:00:24,698 --> 01:00:25,200
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

952
01:00:25,301 --> 01:00:33,240
Speaker 0: so like literally like one of the ones I watch is I See this guy like fucking around in his inventory and like just dicking around in this house and then he hears a gunshot.

953
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:36,088
Speaker 0: that's me because I fired a shot at something.

954
01:00:36,529 --> 01:01:00,232
Speaker 0: and then you see him like look and then creep over to the window and like Lean and he sees naked rims stay like off in the distance and then he like leans again And he keeps like lean lean like looking and when he's confident that I don't know he's there then he very very carefully Like gets his gun out fucks with his sight aims at my head like holds his breath and just headshots me And I didn't see any that rid.

955
01:01:00,534 --> 01:01:01,420
Speaker 0: as far as I was concerned.

956
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,525
Speaker 0: It was naked.

957
01:01:02,585 --> 01:01:05,156
Speaker 0: rim is walking through the woods and no one knows he's there.

958
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:07,665
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It's such a fun game.

959
01:01:08,107 --> 01:01:09,090
Speaker 0: It's pretty definitely.

960
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:14,529
Speaker 0: do not buy it unless you Think you'll have enough time to play it though.

961
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you have to base like I don't there are other games.

962
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:22,311
Speaker 1: I have that I'm playing like every day But like pub G I can only play like if it's now.

963
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:24,258
Speaker 1: I have hours to sit down and play games.

964
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:26,707
Speaker 1: right now No one's here and I got nothing to do.

965
01:01:27,089 --> 01:01:27,932
Speaker 1: it's game time.

966
01:01:27,952 --> 01:01:34,446
Speaker 1: if you have time like that where it's game time Yep, you're gonna make it a thing at least once a week, then you can buy this game.

967
01:01:34,546 --> 01:01:36,069
Speaker 1: But otherwise don't.

968
01:01:36,169 --> 01:01:39,242
Speaker 1: also the game has Microtransactions.

969
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:41,309
Speaker 1: you loot crate shit cuz that it just ignore him.

970
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:42,814
Speaker 1: It's a hundred percent cosmetic.

971
01:01:42,914 --> 01:01:44,740
Speaker 1: So I am buying absolutely none of it.

972
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,234
Speaker 1: I think there was actually you know, I twitch prime.

973
01:01:47,254 --> 01:01:48,139
Speaker 1: you get all this free stuff.

974
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:51,337
Speaker 1: There's like a dead mouse pub G thing you can get for free.

975
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:54,460
Speaker 1: right now I'm not even getting that free loot crate that I get for free.

976
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:58,156
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll get it and not open it for now, even though it's disadvantage.

977
01:01:58,257 --> 01:01:58,960
Speaker 0: I'm just being naked.

978
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,339
Speaker 0: I didn't even put on the default clothes.

979
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:05,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm using the default clothes and I'll never use non default clothes and that's just how it's gonna be.

980
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:06,979
Speaker 0: I'm gonna commit to being naked.

981
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,452
Speaker 1: I'll see how much how much pub G money I can accrue and never spend.

982
01:02:10,632 --> 01:02:14,387
Speaker 0: cuz it's someday if I ever win a match It'll be that fucking naked guy.

983
01:02:14,407 --> 01:02:16,256
Speaker 1: Do you get more pub G money if you win?

984
01:02:16,296 --> 01:02:16,376
Speaker 1: is?

985
01:02:16,436 --> 01:02:18,507
Speaker 1: I don't even how it works I don't know.

986
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:19,234
Speaker 0: I never I'm speaking.

987
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,054
Speaker 1: I forgot one awesome thing about this game that we build to us.

988
01:02:23,074 --> 01:02:24,199
Speaker 1: things about the game number one.

989
01:02:24,802 --> 01:02:26,570
Speaker 1: This is red circle that appears in the map.

990
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:27,033
Speaker 1: Sometimes.

991
01:02:27,153 --> 01:02:28,600
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and just bombs.

992
01:02:28,841 --> 01:02:33,680
Speaker 1: If you're in that red circle and you're not in a building bombs and shit fall out of the sky.

993
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,760
Speaker 1: So you kind of want to not go in the red circles and it sort of creates interesting player movements, right?

994
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,208
Speaker 1: You know, especially it tends to.

995
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:44,380
Speaker 0: it's really in a game where the red circle appeared over a city.

996
01:02:44,922 --> 01:02:48,560
Speaker 1: So me and the rando squad everyone starts running out of the city.

997
01:02:48,921 --> 01:02:51,974
Speaker 0: We camped outside the city and they got flushed out by the bombs.

998
01:02:52,014 --> 01:02:52,957
Speaker 0: We killed like four people.

999
01:02:52,998 --> 01:02:53,600
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

1000
01:02:54,162 --> 01:02:57,531
Speaker 1: The other thing is that there's this sometimes the airplane comes and drops a crate.

1001
01:02:57,992 --> 01:03:00,680
Speaker 1: when the airplane drops a crate it parachutes down.

1002
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:03,218
Speaker 1: It's a red box and then smoke comes out of it.

1003
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:08,396
Speaker 1: That red crate is full of the best loot like level 3 armors level 3 helmets guns.

1004
01:03:08,436 --> 01:03:09,500
Speaker 1: You can't get anywhere else.

1005
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:15,280
Speaker 0: It's also a giant sign saying hey noobs are gonna run toward this thing and be very easy to kill right.

1006
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:22,060
Speaker 1: So like there been you think Scott who's not good at the game and never will be would never go anywhere near a deadly crate.

1007
01:03:22,361 --> 01:03:34,821
Speaker 1: but actually there been like two or three times and we're like, I've been on a team the crate just lands near us like Or the crate lands kind of near us and then we go in camp and see if anyone goes for it and then shoot at them.

1008
01:03:34,862 --> 01:03:45,325
Speaker 1: it's like the crate is like it creates like these events of Awesomeness that happen in these individual places if you're not in the center of the action Suddenly, aha.

1009
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:48,038
Speaker 1: Here's a hot spot of action near this crate full of loot.

1010
01:03:48,953 --> 01:03:52,388
Speaker 1: so You know it mixes it up and I wish they would.

1011
01:03:52,568 --> 01:04:02,410
Speaker 1: I think the game could actually do with like just only one just one More thing that could happen on the map besides the red circle in the crate Just like a third thing.

1012
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,899
Speaker 1: that would be four would be too many.

1013
01:04:04,422 --> 01:04:12,437
Speaker 1: But it's like a third special event that could happen on the map randomly Just to stir things up a little bit, you know, yeah, there's some weathery stuff like.

1014
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,020
Speaker 0: there's stuff like that.

1015
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, the weather happen is different every time.

1016
01:04:15,168 --> 01:04:18,000
Speaker 1: the weather moves along but the weather only matters a little bit.

1017
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,032
Speaker 0: It depends like in a rainstorm people can't hear you like it's.

1018
01:04:22,072 --> 01:04:23,677
Speaker 0: you can book it fog.

1019
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:24,500
Speaker 1: You know, I can see you.

1020
01:04:26,141 --> 01:04:28,950
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah, it's a is a good old FPS.

1021
01:04:29,171 --> 01:04:29,432
Speaker 0: We're gonna.

1022
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:31,800
Speaker 0: I'm gonna keep playing it semi regularly for a long time.

1023
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,814
Speaker 1: I think yeah, I mean, I don't think it's going anywhere.

1024
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:34,720
Speaker 1: It's still super popular.

1025
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:40,318
Speaker 0: It's like a weekend thing and like an evening thing like I'll play overwatch every day But I'll play this like every weekend at least.
