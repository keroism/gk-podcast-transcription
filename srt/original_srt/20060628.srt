00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,417
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday June 28th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,680
Speaker 1: tonight We begin reviewing three experimental works by Osamu Tezuka the god of manga.

3
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:19,485
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:22,494
Speaker 1: I e means aid est.

5
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,667
Speaker 1: it is that is Eg you can say it.

6
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,434
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know the Latin part.

7
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:30,120
Speaker 1: eg means what our ergo gratis?

8
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:31,485
Speaker 0: Yes, that's something like that.

9
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:34,317
Speaker 0: It means it is example exo exemplia gratis.

10
00:00:34,357 --> 00:00:37,490
Speaker 1: There you go Yeah, not ergo gratis exemplia gratis, whatever.

11
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:45,809
Speaker 1: anyway people using those words incorrectly Bothers me almost as much as people typing Loose when they mean Lo se.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:46,591
Speaker 0: you know what.

13
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,200
Speaker 0: it didn't bother me until a few days ago when I learned the difference.

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

15
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:56,918
Speaker 0: I've been using them interchangeably and randomly for a long time and now I know that 99% of the time I want to use eg.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, very rarely.

17
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,868
Speaker 1: Do you want to use ie?

18
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:05,822
Speaker 1: because it's usually easier to just say something equivalent in English yep Eg.

19
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:09,559
Speaker 0: now if I see some ie's where there should be eg's I'm gonna come down.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, yep, all right.

21
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,558
Speaker 1: We just we were talking about that right before we started recording so I had to get it in.

22
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,665
Speaker 0: yep Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's Wednesday.

23
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:18,488
Speaker 1: It's anime day.

24
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:22,763
Speaker 1: Whoo we're gonna review some anime something crazy something We haven't done in a while

25
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:23,365
Speaker 0: whoa

26
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:40,660
Speaker 1: and like to say one because it's anime day and Jim vowels mentioned this to us a few Days ago, I would like to remind all of you out there who are considering going to Otakon that the discount or pre-registered Meaning you get a cheaper registration if you do it online ends on the 4th of July.

27
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:48,120
Speaker 0: So if between now and the 4th of July you go to the Otakon website and buy a ticket it will cost you $50.

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,641
Speaker 0: All right, yep, if you decide that you want to buy a ticket after the 4th of July it will cost you $60.

29
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:55,423
Speaker 0: I think.

30
00:01:55,904 --> 00:02:03,888
Speaker 1: yeah plus keep in mind that by pre-registering you make the Otakon people's job a lot easier And you make your life much easier.

31
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:06,958
Speaker 0: yeah, it can and probably will sell out.

32
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:15,032
Speaker 1: plus I'll note I mean there were at least what like 10,000 people in line on Thursday Maybe slightly less than that last year for the pre pre-registration.

33
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,879
Speaker 1: Yeah that line blew.

34
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:24,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you want to pre-register and get there on Thursday to reduce stress worry and increase your fun.

35
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:29,699
Speaker 1: Plus you definitely want to be there Thursday for the pre Otakon geek nights pool party.

36
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,240
Speaker 1: of course You'll have to find it to actually go to it, but it we won't be hard to find.

37
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:35,338
Speaker 0: We will tell the cool people where it is.

38
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:37,847
Speaker 1: That's a big dichotomy.

39
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:41,027
Speaker 1: now if we forget to tell someone that we think is cool They're gonna think we don't think they're cool.

40
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,690
Speaker 0: Well.

41
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,406
Speaker 0: Let trust me if you meet us We will let you know if you are uncool.

42
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:53,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna have a posse at Otakon with three S's You and why and an IG EG.

43
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:54,819
Speaker 0: well any you and a why?

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,240
Speaker 1: Talia yeah, all right, yeah, we got a bunch of news, and we were actually arguing about all this just before the show.

45
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:03,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, good job.

46
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:03,994
Speaker 0: All right.

47
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:04,579
Speaker 1: You can go first.

48
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:06,440
Speaker 0: So this is article.

49
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,423
Speaker 0: It's not really a news.

50
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:13,539
Speaker 0: and the new the article is titled is it illegal to describe the sporting event you're watching now?

51
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:32,190
Speaker 0: the short Answer from a legal perspective is yes Absolutely yes, it is illegal because the laws in this country You're screwed up and the sport companies such as Major League Baseball NBA NFL own Absolutely fucking everything that has to do with their sport.

52
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,553
Speaker 0: you can bet you can't even like take a picture of a football at a football game Without a belonging to the NFL.

53
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:39,900
Speaker 0: It's just insane.

54
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:40,783
Speaker 1: What's that boat?

55
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:45,840
Speaker 1: dad that son is a boat that is free broadcasting Major League Baseball with implied oral consent?

56
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,350
Speaker 1: But not written consent expressed.

57
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:48,572
Speaker 0: written.

58
00:03:48,632 --> 00:03:49,556
Speaker 1: expressed written consent.

59
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,200
Speaker 0: yep.

60
00:03:51,402 --> 00:03:53,591
Speaker 0: Then Major League Baseball has the satellites of evil.

61
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,555
Speaker 0: they're coming around.

62
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:55,600
Speaker 1: right that was a different episode.

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:03,200
Speaker 0: But yeah the thing is I see that two possibilities for the future and this guy who writes this article sees the same thing.

64
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:03,745
Speaker 0: kind of.

65
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:19,690
Speaker 0: either Sports will open up and allow you know Amateurs and people like us to create content around their sport freely or those sports will Gradually fade away and people lose interest in them.

66
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:22,280
Speaker 1: now consider that I mean the way it is now.

67
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,497
Speaker 1: They make their money off of people coming to the place and buying a lot of beer and soda and tickets.

68
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:40,046
Speaker 0: they make money from TV and they make money from merchandise and of course advertising which is rolled into TV but also on the game itself they have and at the stadium yeah and food at the stadium and Parking at the stadium.

69
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:42,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, they make money in a whole jillion ways.

70
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:52,540
Speaker 1: now There are a whole bunch of laws in place in addition to our standard intellectual property stuff to prevent people from bootlegging broadcasting or in any way doing anything with the sport.

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,420
Speaker 1: So if you bring a camera to a baseball game and you film it it is so illegal to show that to anyone.

72
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:01,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might notice that on YouTube.

73
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,996
Speaker 0: You don't see too many sporting videos.

74
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:10,400
Speaker 0: I mean on Google video There's a lot of soccer stuff, but have you seen a lot of MLB stuff?

75
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:13,188
Speaker 1: Nope, the best you'll find are hockey fights.

76
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:21,453
Speaker 1: In fact, I suggest right now type quote hockey space fights Pluralized unquote into Google video and watch everything that comes up or YouTube.

77
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, either one, but I digress.

78
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:38,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, the point is is that right now there are a lot of podcasts and video not so much video podcasts out there For lesser-known or less popular sports that are gaining a lot of support for those sports.

79
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:49,407
Speaker 1: Also, there are a lot of people who just enjoy announcing sports games or they like to sit and talk about sports so they'll watch a hockey game and Record a podcast where they just do the play-by-play.

80
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:58,837
Speaker 0: and there are a lot of people out there who might not like particular sportscasters and you don't really have a much choice of which sportscaster to listen to.

81
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:16,487
Speaker 0: so They will rat they will opt to rather to turn off the audio or listen to the radio on there instead, you know in addition to the television with a device that delays the audio or delays the video to make them match up or They just won't have any announcing at all.

82
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:19,276
Speaker 0: because it's so painful because the announcers is so terrible now.

83
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:22,932
Speaker 1: bear in mind that right now Even though this is not a mass market.

84
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:24,460
Speaker 1: I mean, this is amateur to amateur.

85
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:26,039
Speaker 1: I think the article even uses those words.

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:37,540
Speaker 1: It does indeed amateur people creating content giving it to other amateur content creators who are also consumers Mm-hmm, and even now the industry is bit by bit realizing they don't like this one bit.

87
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:38,924
Speaker 0: well, look at this.

88
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:48,605
Speaker 0: Formula One is I think is the best example and it's one of my current favorite sports and mostly because of this podcast Formula pod.

89
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:53,520
Speaker 0: it's just two guys who live in the United States where Formula One is not very popular at all.

90
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,399
Speaker 0: It's hardly known at all in this country, but it is the premier motorsport in the entire world.

91
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:00,846
Speaker 1: Hell you want to know how obscure it is.

92
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:06,420
Speaker 1: when I worked at IBM there was a guy who raced cars professionally and semi-professionally.

93
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:09,449
Speaker 1: He didn't watch f1 at all.

94
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,653
Speaker 1: He knew nothing about it.

95
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,439
Speaker 1: He didn't care about it in any way shape or form Yep.

96
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:19,795
Speaker 0: However, it is crazy popular in places like Spain where the current world champion is from.

97
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,720
Speaker 1: damn you Alonzo just explode already.

98
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:24,367
Speaker 1: I know seriously Racketing was so close.

99
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:38,540
Speaker 0: It's so close yet so far anyway Formula pod are these two guys who talk about f1 and They get a lot of listeners and they got a big forum and then they even have all kinds of crazy stuff.

100
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:49,320
Speaker 0: They teamed up with GP tours, which is a company that you know Is a tourist company that will take you to f1 races for and has parties at f1 races where drivers go and they arranged a?

101
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,184
Speaker 0: Whole party at the US Grand Prix Grand Prix Grand Prix.

102
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,812
Speaker 0: and they got a huge sponsor.

103
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:58,506
Speaker 0: I think it's I forget the name.

104
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:03,222
Speaker 0: It's some international travel insurance company is sponsoring these podcast guys I don't know.

105
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,610
Speaker 1: all I can think of are all the sponsors.

106
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,374
Speaker 1: I keep seeing it f1.

107
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:08,410
Speaker 0: Yeah Petronas no, no, no, it's.

108
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:08,691
Speaker 0: it's.

109
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:13,809
Speaker 0: I think it's international Multinational underwriters is their sponsor.

110
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:14,412
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

111
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:16,120
Speaker 1: giving them free advertising on geek night?

112
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,427
Speaker 0: I guess no one here.

113
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:20,453
Speaker 0: It really needs to buy travel insurance.

114
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:22,720
Speaker 1: watch like ten people immediately going.

115
00:08:23,184 --> 00:08:24,919
Speaker 0: Oh, I need a travel insurance shit.

116
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:32,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay Yeah, we're just kind of we're so anti advertising that yeah any amount of advertising.

117
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:39,399
Speaker 0: But the thing with Formula One is it is the best example of a sport that keeps everything close to the chest.

118
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:45,845
Speaker 0: it prides itself on being ultra ultra ultra exclusive Ultra exclusive.

119
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:50,099
Speaker 1: they sell you the idea of going to f1 is like this big thing and it's this.

120
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:57,160
Speaker 0: yes It's like this big pomp and royalty ancient tradition big fancy.

121
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,740
Speaker 0: I mean these guys race in Monaco with princes.

122
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:01,585
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

123
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,018
Speaker 1: There's more fanfare about f1 at f1 than there is at Wimbledon.

124
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,525
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just insane.

125
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:08,147
Speaker 0: and they don't.

126
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,280
Speaker 0: they don't give up the rights to a damn thing.

127
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,383
Speaker 0: They don't give up a dollar.

128
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:17,576
Speaker 0: the agreement the the Concord agreement that keeps f1 together is a secret.

129
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:21,325
Speaker 0: It's so Snobby, it's insane.

130
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:34,840
Speaker 1: and I would submit I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever to back this up that the fact that F1 races are now trivially pirated and available on the internet right after the races has greatly increased American watching.

131
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:37,690
Speaker 0: Well, no, there's only about 300 people download those things.

132
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:38,733
Speaker 1: Oh, how do you know that?

133
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:40,760
Speaker 0: Where do you look at the bit torrent stats?

134
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:42,307
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I didn't even know where you got them.

135
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:44,115
Speaker 1: They just appeared periodically and you turn them on.

136
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:49,680
Speaker 0: Yeah bit torrent stats Oh, okay, cuz it's it's on speed TV, which is and it's also on CBS.

137
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:53,214
Speaker 0: So here's where I get all the examples, you know, what 300 is a big increase.

138
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:58,117
Speaker 0: Yeah number one You've got a sport that's ultra exclusive and no one can get access to the sport.

139
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:08,412
Speaker 0: number two You've got a podcast which is very popular and is bringing together people who enjoy this sport in a in a country where the sport Is not popular and is increasing popularity.

140
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:16,482
Speaker 0: of the sport number three you've got a sport where when it's this sport is shown in America on speed TV and CBS.

141
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:24,499
Speaker 0: four races a year are on CBS and the announcers on CBS are God awful and know what they're talking about.

142
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:26,004
Speaker 0: They're god-awful.

143
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:36,520
Speaker 0: everyone hates it when the race is on CBS because the announcers are so piss piss shit poor Like they just they really imagine watching a commentary in any sport.

144
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:43,280
Speaker 1: If you don't like sports just make up a sport and imagine a guy who doesn't know the rules and has no idea what's going On just kind of trying to talk.

145
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,648
Speaker 0: Imagine a guy commentating Mario and it's like up.

146
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:46,912
Speaker 0: Mario jumped on the goomba.

147
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:49,260
Speaker 0: that gets you a hundred points and he doesn't die.

148
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:53,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you run into the side of that goomba, you can explode and you'll lose a life.

149
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,760
Speaker 1: Whoa two goombas in a row.

150
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,745
Speaker 0: Whoa, oh, he double jumped.

151
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:58,211
Speaker 0: He gets more points for doing that.

152
00:10:58,412 --> 00:10:58,633
Speaker 1: Yeah.

153
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:00,540
Speaker 1: I heard a man died trying to double jazz.

154
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,592
Speaker 0: Listen, that's watching formula one on CBS.

155
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:03,276
Speaker 0: It's terrible.

156
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:20,233
Speaker 0: So Amateur to amateur, you know creations of commentary and other sorts of sport related, you know arts and videos and audios and Creative works can is is only serves to boost the sport.

157
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:22,359
Speaker 0: It's the only purpose it has.

158
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:41,122
Speaker 0: so if sports continue to be exclusive and Go after people who try to make amateur, you know creative works from the sport those sports over the long run are going to be hurting and the other sports that allow this shit to go on are going to be Boomin.

159
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:45,596
Speaker 1: now, of course don't think we're like crazy idealists who have no idea how the real world works.

160
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:48,165
Speaker 1: when we say long term We mean like 20 years.

161
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,237
Speaker 0: Well, maybe 10 maybe 10 maybe 10 years sounds right.

162
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:51,799
Speaker 0: 20 years too long.

163
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:59,560
Speaker 1: Ah, you see it really depends on how much of our generation stays this way when they get crushed by the reality of an evil world.

164
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:07,579
Speaker 0: Yep, I see f1 though, you know becoming if the 2008 rules cuz f1 has a problem with the rules I just wrote about on my blog.

165
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:20,160
Speaker 0: But if the 2008 rules for f1 results in an exciting race Then I can really see f1 s popularity going up a little bit at least to the same Popularity is like Indian kart racing is in the u.s.

166
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:33,086
Speaker 1: Plus, I mean outside of the south and I'm not to really disparage NASCAR, but there is a very negative Negative kind of connotation around anything involving NASCAR particularly to people in the north and in urban areas,

167
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:42,600
Speaker 0: yeah, well the thing about NASCAR is that as A thing that gets people excited and you know makes itself interesting and markets itself.

168
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,688
Speaker 0: Well NASCAR is perfect because they did exactly the same thing.

169
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:50,180
Speaker 0: pro wrestling does but as a sport NASCAR is piss-poor.

170
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:53,899
Speaker 0: There's no it's whoever has the best car wins the end.

171
00:12:54,362 --> 00:13:01,860
Speaker 1: but there are people who would like racing or like racing but They don't want to watch NASCAR either because they don't like it or they don't want to be associated with it.

172
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:10,030
Speaker 1: And a lot of these people I think if they saw f1 actually saw it instead of just hearing about it or not hearing about it They'd probably really like it.

173
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:14,040
Speaker 0: the thing about all About sports is that number one?

174
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,011
Speaker 0: You can't enjoy is watching a sport unless you know the rules.

175
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:23,980
Speaker 0: if you watch a game of baseball and you don't know the rules Then like a guy hits a home run you're not excited because you don't realize the meaning of it.

176
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,431
Speaker 1: You know, of course, you don't need to know all the rules.

177
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:27,054
Speaker 0: No, you don't.

178
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:28,200
Speaker 0: I don't know all the rules of f1.

179
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,143
Speaker 0: They're crazy, you know.

180
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:35,482
Speaker 1: like even baseball you need to know about the crazy pop-fly stuff or what happens when like the pitch hits a Bird.

181
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:37,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's just interesting.

182
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:42,320
Speaker 1: when you find it out when it happens strangely or like hockey All you need to know is that they're trying to get the pucks in the nets.

183
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:44,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you'll learn over the course of time.

184
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:46,735
Speaker 0: Oh, you can hit them but you can't hit them that way.

185
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,734
Speaker 1: if you do that Put you in the box two minutes.

186
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:50,499
Speaker 1: you have to sit in the.

187
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,583
Speaker 0: yeah I guess you kind of have to know about power plays to really enjoy hot You know what?

188
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:56,100
Speaker 1: If you see one power play you figure it out.

189
00:13:56,242 --> 00:14:03,299
Speaker 0: Oh that got that team has more guys now But it's the more you understand a sport the more you are interested in it.

190
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,575
Speaker 0: So and that's something else is that f1 if you just watch it or not even NASCAR?

191
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:10,602
Speaker 0: there is stuff to NASCAR People.

192
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:18,350
Speaker 0: if you watch NASCAR and you just you know, no matter you've never seen it before in your life on the surface it is a bunch of cars driving in a circle.

193
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,295
Speaker 0: that is what it is.

194
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:36,846
Speaker 0: and but if you come to understand You know the strategies of NASCAR the pit strategies the mechanics the you know The way you drive NASCAR drafting and then you know teaming up and passing guys and all this sort of stuff It becomes more interesting.

195
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:41,300
Speaker 0: you understand the strategies that are being carried out and f1 is the same way.

196
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:46,959
Speaker 0: If you just watch it and you don't try to learn anything about it, it won't ever be interesting to you.

197
00:14:47,902 --> 00:15:03,555
Speaker 0: But if you go and put in a tiny effort just pay attention to what some guys are saying about it It will become very very interesting because it's very complex and serious and there's a lot going on That's not visible to the eyeball in plain sight without someone pointing it out to you.

198
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:13,030
Speaker 0: And that is why Creative amateur works usings about sports are very good because those guys point the stuff out to you And make the sport more interesting.

199
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:14,640
Speaker 0: and the sport doesn't do it on its own.

200
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:21,194
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean a hockey announcer isn't gonna stop and say a power play is when blah blah blah He just starts screaming and you have no idea why.

201
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:31,760
Speaker 0: yep Now the f1 announcers actually on speed TV I say are terrific because not only do they you know When the race is just kind of going and nothing exciting is happening.

202
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:36,336
Speaker 0: They teach you all kinds of stuff about tires and aerodynamics that you don't really know.

203
00:15:36,356 --> 00:15:37,320
Speaker 1: They're also funny.

204
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:50,588
Speaker 0: They're also funny and you know If you watch a game say between the Mets who are really good this season and I don't know the Kansas City Royals are always Terrible, I don't think they're gonna play against each other, you know this year because it's interleague But you know, let's say you see that game.

205
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:58,313
Speaker 0: The announcers will never say anything like haha the Royals suck They're gonna get their asses kicked but the f1 announcers are like team super gurry.

206
00:15:58,353 --> 00:15:59,055
Speaker 0: They're terrible.

207
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:00,820
Speaker 0: Wow, they can't drive.

208
00:16:01,203 --> 00:16:02,634
Speaker 0: Oh look, they're out of the race again.

209
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:06,191
Speaker 1: Oh, well All right, though, I think we should pry nix the sports.

210
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:08,180
Speaker 1: we've talked about him for a while and it is anime day.

211
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:12,599
Speaker 1: It is anime day now since we went long on that because we got on a sports tangent.

212
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:16,016
Speaker 1: I'll be real quick about this because you've seen this in the news.

213
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:16,760
Speaker 0: I'm gonna drag it out.

214
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:37,797
Speaker 1: I don't need to explain this to anyone but the CCC BDA 2006 the communications comma consumers choice and broadband deployment act of 2006 which is the current acronym soup bad legislation Has passed committee in the Senate and it's going to be voted on now.

215
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:40,708
Speaker 1: real briefly This law is a lot.

216
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:43,839
Speaker 1: is this law which brings the broadcast flag back?

217
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,399
Speaker 1: Which is that bad thing that prevents you from recording shows from the TV?

218
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,780
Speaker 0: So if this law passes TVs everywhere will be broken.

219
00:16:51,051 --> 00:17:05,859
Speaker 1: Okay next now it also has this other law the safety something wrapped into it and all these other riders and the law also Basically gives the giant dog dick to net neutrality, which is a topic we've talked about at least twice in the past.

220
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:07,556
Speaker 1: It's the real.

221
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:29,252
Speaker 1: briefly This is the idea that an ISP like Comcast has the right and in fact the duty to charge Google Money for allowing Google access to their subscribers Because otherwise Google and Yahoo and all those people are getting a free ride on their hard work and their cables Even though they're selling the bandwidth and that's all they sell.

222
00:17:29,273 --> 00:17:31,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we're not gonna argue about that.

223
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,243
Speaker 1: It's a bad thing.

224
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:35,494
Speaker 1: No one who knows anything about technology disagrees on this point.

225
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,100
Speaker 0: This is a bad bad law.

226
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:39,653
Speaker 0: So we need to call them senators and say wow, you're dumb.

227
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:40,839
Speaker 0: You don't know anything about technology.

228
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,455
Speaker 1: vote No, I mean, I'm not even kidding.

229
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:47,280
Speaker 1: among Technological professionals there is no debate on this topic.

230
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:54,400
Speaker 1: The only people in the entire world who are advocating an end to net neutrality are the heads of ISPs.

231
00:17:54,621 --> 00:18:01,931
Speaker 1: Big ISPs little ISPs want net neutrality and Politicians who were paid by big ISPs.

232
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:02,754
Speaker 0: That's it.

233
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,200
Speaker 1: go to like open secrets or something.

234
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:16,605
Speaker 1: You can look at exactly which senators Comcast gave a bunch of money to and then you can look at which senators are pro this and which senators are against this and the results are enlightening and Obvious.

235
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway I normally don't tell people things like this because a million other people do.

236
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,260
Speaker 1: but call your senator write to your senator.

237
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:27,279
Speaker 0: Go to the EFF website is probably something you can do there.

238
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:32,115
Speaker 1: Just tell him that the CCC BDA is a bad thing because it is very bad.

239
00:18:32,496 --> 00:18:36,040
Speaker 1: granted to play devil's advocate I love for shit like this to be passed.

240
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:38,548
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz when it gets passed it's like the flag burning.

241
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:40,195
Speaker 0: if it gets passed we can burn flags.

242
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:43,385
Speaker 0: if this gets passed we can break The broadcast flag only that.

243
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:49,981
Speaker 1: but the more legislation passes that is just bad and actually takes DRM and shoves it in people's Faces.

244
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:53,993
Speaker 1: and the more people have to deal with this the more angry they're getting yet.

245
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:58,160
Speaker 1: and there's a chance a small chance that Eventually, they'll get angry enough to do something.

246
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,873
Speaker 0: The problem is they do it so gradually that no one you know notices they have.

247
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:03,740
Speaker 0: we have to get them to pass a law.

248
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,420
Speaker 0: That's so drastic that people will get pissed off.

249
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:14,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just fear a future when I'm an old man and I have a DVD and kids say what the hell How are you playing that you don't have those chips in your eye?

250
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:30,020
Speaker 1: We've got as the music told you things of the day Things of the day and they're both dancing related and one of them is anime related.

251
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:31,992
Speaker 0: Oh, I love dancing things of the day so much.

252
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can do yours first.

253
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:41,488
Speaker 0: Mine is a video that is from the Chicago Breakdancing champion contest of some year.

254
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:41,969
Speaker 0: I don't know.

255
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,075
Speaker 0: It's just some really cool breakdancing.

256
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:44,978
Speaker 1: It's a highlights reel.

257
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:45,820
Speaker 1: It's it's awesome.

258
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:47,927
Speaker 0: It's very awesome breakdancing video.

259
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:51,940
Speaker 0: I love watching dancing of awesomeness, and this is awesome dancing.

260
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:55,210
Speaker 0: Wait for the guy with the broom, that's all I can say.

261
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait for the guy with the broom.

262
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:57,960
Speaker 0: He's awesome.

263
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:00,489
Speaker 1: Now, you know, I actually used to breakdance.

264
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:01,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure.

265
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,820
Speaker 1: actually this is entirely true.

266
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:14,837
Speaker 1: However, the story I'm about to tell while entirely true will completely dissuade you from my breakdancing skills When I was young and when I young I mean like between the ages of four and six.

267
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:37,160
Speaker 1: I For some reason really liked breakdancing as a kid and my mom has videos to prove this That what I would do is I'd carry around like my I'd sit with my grandparents at these like outdoor markets and I'd sit up Behind them in the sidewalk and I'd put this piece of cardboard down and I'd play cassettes of music I'd like from my fisher-price tape player and I'd spin around on my butt and act like I was breakdancing.

268
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:39,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've done a butt spin too.

269
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:40,172
Speaker 0: So I used to breakdance.

270
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:40,654
Speaker 0: Yeah.

271
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:41,296
Speaker 0: Yeah.

272
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:41,899
Speaker 0: Well, there you go.

273
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:48,460
Speaker 1: If I ever find the videos or get my mom to send them to me I will put them on the website.

274
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:56,213
Speaker 0: I don't think rim breakdancing is something that is as cool as Professionals breakdancing.

275
00:20:56,516 --> 00:21:02,260
Speaker 1: Nah, nah Nah My only real move was spin around on my butt or spin around on my knee and then fall and hurt myself.

276
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,371
Speaker 0: If I get the opportunity, I'm gonna try to take breakdancing lessons.

277
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:06,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, you do that.

278
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:07,920
Speaker 1: I'll take my motorcycle lessons.

279
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,719
Speaker 0: I'll take motorcycle breakdancing lessons.

280
00:21:12,222 --> 00:21:16,575
Speaker 1: All right, anyway my thing because it's anime day is very anime related.

281
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:19,946
Speaker 1: it is a video Funky can't?

282
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:23,179
Speaker 1: maybe you might have seen why I don't know.

283
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,419
Speaker 1: I just found this kind of randomly not even linked to from us.

284
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,263
Speaker 1: I just don't it.

285
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:31,560
Speaker 1: I found it and it's basically this music video someone made.

286
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:33,150
Speaker 1: I have no idea who or why.

287
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:34,540
Speaker 1: I did absolutely no research.

288
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:40,037
Speaker 1: It is cel-shaded 3d and it is kind of like Michael Jackson's thriller.

289
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:43,447
Speaker 0: only it Obviously steals from thriller a lot.

290
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:50,070
Speaker 1: only it's all these girls who get turned into cat girls by aliens and they dance.

291
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:55,351
Speaker 1: And there's two girls who weren't turned into cat girls and they're chasing them.

292
00:21:55,812 --> 00:21:58,440
Speaker 1: and it's adorable and simultaneously hilarious.

293
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,006
Speaker 0: Simultaneously awesome dancing.

294
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:00,969
Speaker 1: Yeah the dancing.

295
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:06,380
Speaker 1: I mean, it's really high quality even to the point It's not as good as the breakdancing in mind thing of the day.

296
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:12,960
Speaker 1: The thing I like about it is that there's all like the supporting dancers in the back and they're obviously all kind of time together.

297
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:17,000
Speaker 1: But it looks like whoever did it introduced some delay and some little variations.

298
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:23,320
Speaker 1: So it looks like a bunch of unique things dancing as opposed to a bunch of cloned 3d models dancing.

299
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:24,482
Speaker 0: That's cool.

300
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,068
Speaker 1: And the front it's really cool.

301
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:26,530
Speaker 1: Watch it.

302
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:27,614
Speaker 1: The music's cool.

303
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:29,140
Speaker 1: It's really weird.

304
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,680
Speaker 1: I will do a little bit of research and find out exactly what the hell this was at a later date.

305
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:36,912
Speaker 0: That's a good idea, but it's anime day.

306
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:41,214
Speaker 1: This is the first time in many weeks We've had a chance to sit down and review some anime.

307
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:47,664
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm now the anime we're gonna talk about is an anime that's kind of Weird for most people.

308
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:48,206
Speaker 1: Yes.

309
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:51,516
Speaker 1: It is actually three distinct shorts that we watched recently.

310
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,262
Speaker 0: Well, they're not so short one of them They're all.

311
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:54,971
Speaker 0: they're basically movies of varying length.

312
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:55,173
Speaker 1: Yeah.

313
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:56,460
Speaker 1: Well one is a short definitely.

314
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,512
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's a short movie as opposed to a full-length movie.

315
00:23:00,954 --> 00:23:02,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like two minutes long though.

316
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:03,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's true.

317
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:09,980
Speaker 0: Anyway, Osamu Tezuka is the god of manga the god the god undisputed.

318
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,300
Speaker 0: It's not like, you know, you know, some people say oh so and so is the god of rock.

319
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:15,957
Speaker 0: No, so-and-so is the god of rock.

320
00:23:15,998 --> 00:23:20,059
Speaker 0: No Osamu Tezuka is the undisputed god of manga.

321
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:22,017
Speaker 0: period the end of the story.

322
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:27,959
Speaker 0: If you haven't read his manga, you should go to the store now and buy Buddha and Phoenix right now.

323
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,583
Speaker 0: Go do that.

324
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:29,792
Speaker 1: I haven't even actually read him though.

325
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:30,497
Speaker 1: I'm going too soon.

326
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:36,014
Speaker 0: Yes He also invented Astro Boy and you know the first, you know, it spawned.

327
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:44,663
Speaker 0: every anime you've got now Came out of Astro Boy somehow which came out of Mickey Mouse and now the anime is feeding back into the American Animation.

328
00:23:44,885 --> 00:23:51,358
Speaker 0: so it was American animation Japanese animation stole and now it's getting put back in it's crazy loop.

329
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,020
Speaker 1: now It's all because of Osamu Tezuka and we could do a whole show on him which we might someday.

330
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:02,940
Speaker 1: But today we just want to talk about three of these short film slash movies that he did over a long period of time.

331
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:08,013
Speaker 0: Yeah between the years of what 1962 and 1988 something like that something like that.

332
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:17,196
Speaker 0: He created five or so experimental sorts of animations for film festivals and other things.

333
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:20,607
Speaker 1: they very Wildly, they do very wildly.

334
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:24,720
Speaker 0: but and the the art style doesn't even look like it's from him.

335
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:31,700
Speaker 0: It looks just like really old Animation that you would see on super late night TV in America.

336
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,471
Speaker 0: But you know once you watch it and you realize what's going on.

337
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:38,760
Speaker 0: It definitely carries his mark very brightly.

338
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:42,158
Speaker 1: Yes, especially the last one we're gonna talk about the tales of a street corner.

339
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:43,646
Speaker 1: Yes Basically just like up.

340
00:24:43,787 --> 00:24:43,968
Speaker 1: Yep.

341
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:44,812
Speaker 1: There is yep.

342
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:46,300
Speaker 1: That's he always talks about war up there.

343
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,270
Speaker 0: Yep, so all of these things were on bit torrent.

344
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,979
Speaker 0: luckily, you know, we're linking to that Yeah, and I got three of them and we watched them.

345
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:59,364
Speaker 0: And so let's talk about the first one which is the shortest called male Ma le.

346
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,772
Speaker 1: now it's very unique very.

347
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:06,874
Speaker 1: it's very like art film or the kind of thing You see at a film festival or at a student art festival.

348
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:14,746
Speaker 1: It's very short It's very to the point is a very distinct point that it makes through a very Yes, interesting method.

349
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:20,651
Speaker 1: Mmm, actually a lot of our friends we showed us who didn't like it Which surprised me because I thought it was very well done.

350
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:22,719
Speaker 0: I thought it was incredibly well done.

351
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:24,736
Speaker 0: clever unique.

352
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,059
Speaker 0: Poignant I think is a good word.

353
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,060
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm not sure if we should ruin what it's actually about or not because it's so short.

354
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,155
Speaker 1: There was no reason for any of you to not watch this.

355
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:38,427
Speaker 0: Yes Let's just talk about a little bit.

356
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:39,873
Speaker 0: there's this.

357
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:51,128
Speaker 0: it's a black screen and Everything that happens is sort of like the you know is like searchlights sort of light up different parts of the screen Allowing you to see what's going on.

358
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,136
Speaker 0: You know, what's going on over here?

359
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,220
Speaker 0: What's going on over there?

360
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:06,894
Speaker 0: You know just you know a little bit at a time, you know, you can hear voices you can see you know, the white eyeball with the black background to see where characters are and what they're doing and You figure out really quickly.

361
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:13,440
Speaker 0: it's about this guy Who is waiting for something or you know, he's doing some stuff not talking much.

362
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:28,330
Speaker 0: yeah, all the talking is done by his cat and the cat is Down on the bottom left of the screen and the man is on the right side of the screen And the cat is saying all sorts of stuff like, you know I'm trying to get on with my cat woman here

363
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,959
Speaker 1: and there's a. there's a cute female cat right down there with it.

364
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:41,633
Speaker 0: The cute female cat doesn't talk either but the male cat is trying to get with the female cat and the male human being is You know, he's sitting on the right side of the screen being a you know, a person.

365
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:48,314
Speaker 0: he's bothering the male cat He's trying to be all romantic and the cat is complaining about this guy.

366
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:50,140
Speaker 0: and then there's some twists.

367
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:51,934
Speaker 0: Yeah, then it's over cuz it's real short

368
00:26:52,035 --> 00:27:04,055
Speaker 1: cuz bit by bit It reveals more and more and then it resolves and then the at the very end if you haven't figured out what's going on Which we didn't obviously the spotlight pulls back and you see the whole screen and you see what happened and it's

369
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:04,717
Speaker 0: you go.

370
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,880
Speaker 1: Oh I'd like to talk about what I think it's saying But I really really don't want to spoil it for all of you out there.

371
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:13,486
Speaker 0: We can make a spoiler line But then we couldn't.

372
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:16,140
Speaker 0: then people might stop listening and won't go to the rest of the show.

373
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:16,743
Speaker 1: You know what?

374
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:23,520
Speaker 1: next week or a couple weeks from now after we've watched the rest of these We will talk about this again because I'd like to talk about it in more detail.

375
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:31,369
Speaker 1: Okay, so I once again all of you out there if you have any way to do so download at least that one male It's very short and watch it.

376
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:31,771
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

377
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:33,080
Speaker 1: I can't recommend it enough.

378
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,799
Speaker 0: All right, the next Sony watch which was a middling length was mermaid.

379
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:40,612
Speaker 1: This was in a completely different style completely different.

380
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:47,938
Speaker 0: It was very like sketchy and Transparent and just yet like some characters were just outlines and you could see right through them.

381
00:27:48,862 --> 00:28:09,180
Speaker 0: You know, you know what the animation quality reminds me of like those old Alvin and the Chipmunks type of cards We're talking that animation that old but a little bit higher quality than that, but the same style, you know Like old Alvin the not Alvin and the Chipmunks for the 80s old Alvin and the Chipmunks the original real deal.

382
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:14,439
Speaker 1: Now this one and also the third one we're going to talk about are interesting in that there are no words.

383
00:28:15,822 --> 00:28:16,605
Speaker 1: No one speaks.

384
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:23,015
Speaker 0: yes in in male the cat is the only one who talks but This in the rest the other two we're going to talk about.

385
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:26,013
Speaker 0: there is no talking No dialogue whatsoever.

386
00:28:26,034 --> 00:28:28,386
Speaker 1: No fansub needed And in fact it.

387
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:34,875
Speaker 1: if you just showed this to some small off the street or even some anime fan I doubt highly that anyone would say.

388
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:37,042
Speaker 1: Oh, that's anime It's you.

389
00:28:37,162 --> 00:28:43,683
Speaker 0: when you see Tezuka's logo, you know his sort of brand, you know that little face He draws and everything.

390
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:46,291
Speaker 0: if you saw that and you knew then you would know.

391
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:51,605
Speaker 0: and if you were really knew Tezuka's writing style Then you might be able to know.

392
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:57,020
Speaker 0: but other than that you'd might have a hard time unless you just knew beforehand already.

393
00:28:57,961 --> 00:28:59,286
Speaker 1: Now I got this one's very good.

394
00:28:59,346 --> 00:28:59,567
Speaker 1: It's just.

395
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:02,618
Speaker 1: it's the story about a boy and he finds the thing.

396
00:29:02,638 --> 00:29:03,180
Speaker 0: He's a man.

397
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:05,899
Speaker 1: It's I think it's hard to tell is a guy.

398
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:12,082
Speaker 1: yeah, this is guy and he finds this fish is a little fishy and he saves it and The fishy.

399
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:16,092
Speaker 1: he likes the fishy the fishy Becomes a mermaid.

400
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,599
Speaker 1: Whoo-hoo He falls in love and there's this whole thing.

401
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:25,646
Speaker 1: But then he like he brings her home and he's all excited and he shows he has the fishy and he shows it to his Mom and his parents.

402
00:29:25,928 --> 00:29:27,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a kid because he shows it to his parents.

403
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,414
Speaker 1: That's right and the parents look at it and we watch this actually many weeks ago.

404
00:29:32,655 --> 00:29:34,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't remember it that clearly.

405
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:37,860
Speaker 1: Well, he shows it to him and they see a fish but then he looks and he sees the mermaid.

406
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:44,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, and his parents like you're crazy whatever and it just keeps spiraling like he gets sent But the government is testing him because there's something wrong with him.

407
00:29:44,854 --> 00:29:55,287
Speaker 1: He's he's a delinquent He's insane, but he like he sees the mermaid But they all see the fish and they there's all this interesting dialogue where there's no noise or anything but the like.

408
00:29:55,327 --> 00:30:08,982
Speaker 1: the special secret police officers will have a Speech bubble that shows like a fish and then his will show a mermaid and theirs will show a fish with like an explanation Exclamation point and then his will show the mermaid again and then they throw him in a cell and they inject drugs into him and All this stuff.

409
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:12,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's sort of clockwork orangey a little bit.

410
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:18,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, they thought they think someone's insane and they're reconditioning him kind of to fit.

411
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:21,060
Speaker 0: and you know Cuz no one else agrees with them.

412
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:24,544
Speaker 1: but yeah but also a little tiny bit of 1984 is kind of.

413
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:27,515
Speaker 1: the government is coming in and preventing this kid from doing what he was doing.

414
00:30:27,636 --> 00:30:37,433
Speaker 0: or yeah how they you know the evil Adult society is stomping all over the imagination of the children Looking at it as insanity rather than is, you know a good thing.

415
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:43,678
Speaker 1: and there's this terrible and by terrible I mean very just depressing scene where he's locked in this cell and they're torturing him.

416
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:51,784
Speaker 1: like Every time he thinks of the mermaid they torture him and I mean the animation is very simple, but you get the idea You know what's going on.

417
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:59,159
Speaker 1: and every time he thinks of the mermaid as he's tortured more and more He can remember less and less of her until eventually all he remembers is the fish.

418
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:05,016
Speaker 1: And then he finally they let him out and he goes home and he has the fish and he looks at her and he just sees a fish.

419
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's just really kind of sad.

420
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:13,618
Speaker 0: It is kind of sad You know, I don't know if I agree with the message, but it's still really good.

421
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:14,763
Speaker 1: Yes Well, I don't.

422
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:20,406
Speaker 0: I can get enjoyment of things that have messages that I don't agree with a hundred percent Because that isn't the end.

423
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:21,311
Speaker 0: that's not the end.

424
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:21,853
Speaker 1: it keeps going.

425
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:23,280
Speaker 1: I don't know if I want to spoil this one either.

426
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:24,365
Speaker 0: I don't think we should.

427
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:29,950
Speaker 0: but after the guy goes home and sees just the fish There is a another poignant ending.

428
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:33,227
Speaker 1: It's well, I Recommend it again.

429
00:31:33,287 --> 00:31:34,313
Speaker 1: You really should just watch this.

430
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:35,520
Speaker 1: I this is very well done.

431
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,315
Speaker 1: It's it makes a number of points a number of very classic Tezuka points.

432
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:40,836
Speaker 1: Yep.

433
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:41,338
Speaker 0: Yep.

434
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:42,966
Speaker 0: Yep All right.

435
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,820
Speaker 0: The last one we watched is Tales of a street corner.

436
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:53,940
Speaker 1: It's probably my favorite and also the I guess the longest and most interesting of the three we watched also the most well-animated.

437
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:55,689
Speaker 0: It is the most well animated.

438
00:31:55,729 --> 00:32:03,306
Speaker 0: This is more animated more like Even though there's not much actual animation going on and much of it No, there were a lot of.

439
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:06,360
Speaker 0: it is just like, you know, it's still thing where one thing is moving.

440
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:10,673
Speaker 0: This is more like Scooby-doo quality though Except for that guy's feet.

441
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:18,180
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, there was a guy who had like the best animated feet I've ever seen like seriously it right out of like cowboy bebop quality.

442
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,659
Speaker 1: This is just like the most perfectly animated set of army boots walking I've ever seen in my life.

443
00:32:23,403 --> 00:32:29,371
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what it was, but it was just so well done As soon as it happened, it stood out so much from everything else.

444
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:30,836
Speaker 1: It must have been animated on ones.

445
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:31,900
Speaker 0: Who knows.

446
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:36,956
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, give us a little bit of knowledge about animation will go nuts.

447
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:42,796
Speaker 0: Yeah, right So easy to see tales of a street corner is about the story of a street corner.

448
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:43,980
Speaker 0: all the events take.

449
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:50,338
Speaker 0: It's all these events taking place on the corner of a street in what must be France or somewhere like that.

450
00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:51,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's France.

451
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,735
Speaker 0: I'm reasonably certain it's probably France, but it could be anywhere.

452
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:58,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't really matter But it's France for the most part.

453
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:05,220
Speaker 1: now as it opens It introduces kind of randomly a whole bunch of completely disparate characters.

454
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:09,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like as in the opener, which is the credits going by and everything.

455
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:09,505
Speaker 0: They say.

456
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:22,817
Speaker 0: here are the characters, you know the balloon the mouse the light the Violin man the army man the girl that you know the moth and it says a little bit about G for them Like the moth is like a local troublemaker or something like that.

457
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:23,882
Speaker 0: Yep They tell.

458
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:27,214
Speaker 0: it tells you all who all the characters are and what they're like.

459
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:28,820
Speaker 1: and think about this cast of characters.

460
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:39,557
Speaker 1: you've got a poster a tree a light bulb a moth a Little girl's bear and a rat a mouse all kinds of crazy stuff.

461
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:52,566
Speaker 1: It's all the stuff That's on the street corner and the characters all just come out and have their bit and go away in order But they don't completely go away and the stories all kind of intertwine, but they all don't directly Intertwine with each other.

462
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:54,377
Speaker 1: It's like there's just all this stuff happening.

463
00:33:54,397 --> 00:34:01,991
Speaker 0: at the beginning It looks like it's gonna be a chain Like you start with one character you go to the next you go to the next you go to the next and they get to The last character and it's over.

464
00:34:02,031 --> 00:34:02,919
Speaker 0: but that's not what it is.

465
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,309
Speaker 0: You know It doesn't just go through all the characters in a chain and then end.

466
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:22,442
Speaker 0: it goes through some characters then goes back then includes some New ones and goes back and it it Mills about you know cycling through everything That's going on in the street corner as the events take place and as time goes on over the course of what a night Or two.

467
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:24,231
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's just one day.

468
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:29,290
Speaker 1: I think it is just one day though It does kind of fast forward but it's it's hard to explain.

469
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,657
Speaker 0: really it really doesn't matter.

470
00:34:31,717 --> 00:34:35,402
Speaker 0: You can't assign any strict Chronology to it.

471
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:42,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's the basic plot is that it starts out with this girl and she has a balloon or something.

472
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,505
Speaker 1: She drops her teddy bear.

473
00:34:43,726 --> 00:34:47,840
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a balloon outside her window and when she's trying to get it, right?

474
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:53,098
Speaker 0: Yep, and she drops the teddy bear into the gutter the rain gutter out on the roof.

475
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:57,185
Speaker 1: now That's it that she said and she wants it back but there's no way she can get it back.

476
00:34:57,647 --> 00:35:08,120
Speaker 1: and then there's a little mousie finds the bear and he thinks it's awesome and she keeps throwing little bits of cheese to feed her stuffed bear because he's stuck out there alone and The mouse is like yes cheese.

477
00:35:08,461 --> 00:35:11,676
Speaker 1: And then he runs back in with all his mouse brothers and they end up destroying the nest.

478
00:35:11,716 --> 00:35:13,864
Speaker 1: and he gets in trouble and kicked Out for a while by his parents.

479
00:35:13,924 --> 00:35:14,687
Speaker 1: and there's this whole thing.

480
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:15,228
Speaker 0: Yep.

481
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:15,810
Speaker 1: Again.

482
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:16,453
Speaker 1: No words.

483
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,600
Speaker 1: It's just action and music.

484
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:20,285
Speaker 0: There's a lot of music.

485
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:21,732
Speaker 0: The music is real important in this.

486
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:21,933
Speaker 0: this.

487
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,522
Speaker 0: basically there's this one There.

488
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:29,728
Speaker 0: there are a lot of music did different songs in it, but there is one main Musical theme in it.

489
00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:31,078
Speaker 0: I don't think that's what it is.

490
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:34,259
Speaker 1: Well, no, there's the clapping that goes in the background through the whole song.

491
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:41,194
Speaker 0: Well, the clapping I think is more like it's like a one two three One two three if I remember right now, it's just one two one two.

492
00:35:41,254 --> 00:35:42,860
Speaker 0: I don't think we got to go listen to it.

493
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure I was.

494
00:35:44,368 --> 00:35:45,274
Speaker 0: that's not what I remember.

495
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:46,098
Speaker 1: I will bet money.

496
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:57,828
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's this main theme that begins playing at one point and you know it fade It cut it goes away and comes back and it changes Moods and it gets.

497
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:06,160
Speaker 0: you know, it's played happily It's played sadly slowly quickly with and without energy and it always matches what's going on.

498
00:36:06,522 --> 00:36:18,054
Speaker 0: And you can basically if you just listen to that, you know The soundtrack to this you can tell what's going on the whole time think of it as like an early early early Interstellar five five five or like a Fantasia sort of thing.

499
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:31,088
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact it and it starts out I mean the first half or so is like the mouse and then the moth and his Misadventures and the tree who is trying to spread his seed before he dies And all these well before the end of the season.

500
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:34,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, and all these characters interacting and just very animated and lively.

501
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:36,826
Speaker 1: It's humorous at times.

502
00:36:36,886 --> 00:36:37,909
Speaker 1: It's sad at times.

503
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:43,767
Speaker 0: It's it goes all over the place and the main action I think really takes place on the wall.

504
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:56,740
Speaker 1: and it's interesting because once it starts focusing more on the wall itself and the posters The animation all but stops and you literally have scenes where it cuts to a poster of a man playing the violin.

505
00:36:57,522 --> 00:37:11,660
Speaker 0: Then yeah, it's a wall on the side of a building with a bunch of advertising bills posted to it Just covering the whole thing and each different bill on the wall is You know what each advertisement is like a character in itself, you know.

506
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,686
Speaker 0: and they come and go.

507
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:20,640
Speaker 0: as you know ads are pasted over and Ads fall off the wall and new ads that come on the wall and empty spaces.

508
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:29,177
Speaker 1: Most of them are little two-frame things dancing along with the music Other than the majors posters the big characters which are an advertisement for a violinist.

509
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:32,445
Speaker 1: and it's this very Svelte looking violinist guy.

510
00:37:32,746 --> 00:37:43,440
Speaker 0: He's like a cool awesome violin dude all suave an advertisement for a piano playing girl Which is yep, the conducting guy the conductor who was like he's like like the mayor of poster.

511
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,734
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is where the music that I was talking about before comes from.

512
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:49,379
Speaker 0: is these guys play it They're just posters on the wall.

513
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,492
Speaker 1: Now keep in mind that the character ones are really not animated so much.

514
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:56,951
Speaker 1: In fact the violinist and the Piano girl are never animated.

515
00:37:57,152 --> 00:38:01,600
Speaker 0: their move very tiny bits I think the eyes move but they don't show it to you.

516
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,880
Speaker 1: They'll show you the poster and the faces changed a little bit, but they never show it to you changing.

517
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:07,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll zoom in on it.

518
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:09,358
Speaker 0: They'll show you different angles on it.

519
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:13,240
Speaker 1: They're they're very poignant scenes where nothing happens.

520
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:18,800
Speaker 1: It just shows the guy and it's playing the music and you know exactly what that music means and what he's thinking.

521
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,999
Speaker 0: Emotion you see the violin guy and you hear the violin going like.

522
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,374
Speaker 0: You know violin and you know, the guy's all happy in violin.

523
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:38,820
Speaker 0: and then you hear the music like And you know that he's kind of you know trying to do something or that he's sad or you can tell what the violin guy.

524
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:46,280
Speaker 0: Everything he does comes out in the sound of the violin and nothing is about him is animated other than the still picture of his.

525
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:54,118
Speaker 1: And even when they change his face a little bit It's so subtle like they'll make him look a little angry or a little sad or a little determined.

526
00:38:54,439 --> 00:39:02,040
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm not even sure if they actually do that or they do it so well But you can't tell if it's actually been changed or if it's just your mind.

527
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:10,281
Speaker 1: Yeah We really weren't sure and we didn't want to Rewind to find out because that really would have destroyed it for us a little bit maybe but I it was just there.

528
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:20,059
Speaker 1: they convey so much emotion and so much pathos in a character that never moves and Never speaks as literally just a two-dimensional poster stuck to a wall.

529
00:39:20,982 --> 00:39:23,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you didn't even really have to have any animation.

530
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,940
Speaker 0: Just take a bunch of photographs and show one then show the other show one show the other and play music over the whole thing.

531
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:32,950
Speaker 1: Now up until this point, but there's also the slot.

532
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:33,773
Speaker 1: Yeah.

533
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:34,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, the slot is a character.

534
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:35,700
Speaker 1: She's also a poster.

535
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,051
Speaker 1: She's a poster for some sort of body woman show.

536
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:39,151
Speaker 1: Yeah,

537
00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:39,613
Speaker 0: you

538
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:45,480
Speaker 1: know dancing ladies cabaret kind of thing And she seems to like the violinist guy

539
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:48,271
Speaker 0: But then the piano girl comes along and she gets upset

540
00:39:48,713 --> 00:40:01,635
Speaker 1: and the violinist guy seems to obviously Fall deeply in love with the piano girl and the the slutty woman as a result is trying to horn in But then the conductor stops her all without interacting in any direct way because

541
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:02,879
Speaker 0: these are just posters on a wall.

542
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,048
Speaker 0: Now all that comes out in music.

543
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:08,020
Speaker 1: Yep, and up until this point everything is kind of disparate.

544
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:09,380
Speaker 1: There's this all the individual stories.

545
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,309
Speaker 1: You know the mouse is a troublemaking mouse.

546
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:13,620
Speaker 1: with his million brothers and the exhausted mom and dad.

547
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,526
Speaker 1: The little girl is lost her teddy bear.

548
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:19,340
Speaker 1: The moth is just an evil prick who wanders around causing trouble for people.

549
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:25,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, the lamp is old and dying But he refuses for two for his light to fade and he's fighting to the end.

550
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:29,219
Speaker 0: the street lamp is We're using to let everything go dark and the moth is messing with him.

551
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, the moss screws at the street lamp and he screws with the tree who's trying to get his seeds planted before the next season.

552
00:40:36,326 --> 00:40:42,939
Speaker 0: There isn't any dirt on the street so the The tree tries to get his seeds over to where the little patch of dirt is.

553
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:55,517
Speaker 0: Yep, and the the moth pretends to help but then actually just screws everybody All right now rather than spoil the rest of this thing I'm just gonna let you know that eventually this general an actual human being military guy.

554
00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:56,340
Speaker 0: I'll call him the general.

555
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:58,185
Speaker 1: I'll call him captain boot McBoot.

556
00:40:58,426 --> 00:41:03,500
Speaker 0: captain boot McBoot, you know, it's like a mean-looking Kaiser type of military guy.

557
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:09,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the thing is first off you don't see any actual people except for the tone.

558
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:20,404
Speaker 1: halfway through the tone of this animation changes completely and You see these boots these obviously World War one arrow army boots walking and Everything stops.

559
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,640
Speaker 1: and then he puts up this poster of this Kaiser looking general guy.

560
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:25,727
Speaker 1: It's obvious like war probably doesn't.

561
00:41:25,747 --> 00:41:27,875
Speaker 0: he put it on top of some one of the existing pose.

562
00:41:27,895 --> 00:41:29,280
Speaker 1: What's it over the conductor?

563
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:36,019
Speaker 0: That's right, the conductor goes away and all he gets replaced by this evil general and all the happy music stops and everything's different.

564
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:39,984
Speaker 0: suddenly yeah, and it goes from there and That is the point.

565
00:41:40,024 --> 00:41:41,892
Speaker 1: I mean before that it's just a very good animation.

566
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,843
Speaker 1: But at this point it's the alright This is Tezuka.

567
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:45,606
Speaker 0: Yeah.

568
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:51,650
Speaker 0: Oh, we're trying to say war is bad blah blah blah, but not just that war is bad Not just that war it's not that simple.

569
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:56,020
Speaker 1: It's not just war is bad or Propaganda is bad or anything like that.

570
00:41:56,361 --> 00:42:02,137
Speaker 1: It has a lot of complex both pro and anti war and pro and anti spirit.

571
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:03,582
Speaker 1: There's so much to it Mm-hmm.

572
00:42:03,943 --> 00:42:05,309
Speaker 1: And again, we really can't ruin it.

573
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:07,398
Speaker 1: This is something that I really would like all of you to see.

574
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:11,106
Speaker 0: Yep But I'll tell the music is.

575
00:42:11,186 --> 00:42:13,776
Speaker 0: actually I kind of want to get the soundtrack thing to it.

576
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:17,815
Speaker 0: Yes somehow You know, maybe maybe that you know who made that music.

577
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:18,699
Speaker 0: we should find that out.

578
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:30,959
Speaker 1: but just like there's the war poster and then it progresses and there are more posters and it's obvious that things are Militarizing and things are getting bad and then war actually breaks out like actual war but you don't actually see it.

579
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:39,119
Speaker 1: You just see the effects of it on all of these characters Yep, and then it ends in a way that you wouldn't expect and it really it's very thoughtful and poignant.

580
00:42:40,085 --> 00:42:49,605
Speaker 0: The ending of it was really good actually, you know Yeah, because you fight every character has some sort of end and the fact that the whole time I'm thinking all right It's Tezuka.

581
00:42:49,665 --> 00:42:50,934
Speaker 1: It's anti-war great.

582
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:56,254
Speaker 1: I figured it out This is still cool, but then it actually ended and it wasn't just anti-war.

583
00:42:56,295 --> 00:42:57,378
Speaker 1: There was so much more there.

584
00:42:57,398 --> 00:43:07,660
Speaker 0: Yep You know, it's like he does something different with each, you know I mean he could have done be just the anti-war if he just had the wall with the posters.

585
00:43:08,142 --> 00:43:17,860
Speaker 0: but every different part of it had something different to say and do and Something different to show you and that's why there were so many different things and not just posters on the wall.

586
00:43:18,382 --> 00:43:22,158
Speaker 1: And this is also something I would love to talk about on the show and we will do it the next time.

587
00:43:22,198 --> 00:43:25,519
Speaker 0: we talk about These Tezuka animations after we watch the rest of them.

588
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:29,097
Speaker 0: Yes after we watch the rest of them and we maybe rim will read some Tezuka manga.

589
00:43:29,117 --> 00:43:31,589
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I'm in the middle of the difference engine.

590
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,580
Speaker 1: Give me a break whatever plus Scott Pilgrim.

591
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:36,971
Speaker 0: No, Scott Pilgrim takes two seconds to read a volume.

592
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,560
Speaker 1: Yes, but I have one in three and I don't have two.

593
00:43:39,781 --> 00:43:40,608
Speaker 0: So just go buy it.

594
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:41,779
Speaker 1: I don't have time.

595
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:43,484
Speaker 1: Where am I gonna go?

596
00:43:43,504 --> 00:43:45,051
Speaker 1: to a bookstore any bookstore?

597
00:43:45,232 --> 00:43:46,940
Speaker 1: I'll probably get it at the show her maybe.

598
00:43:48,481 --> 00:43:49,509
Speaker 1: But yeah these.

599
00:43:49,771 --> 00:43:50,598
Speaker 1: we'll talk about these.

600
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:55,399
Speaker 1: well Basically what we'll do is we'll talk about the next two that we watch like we did just now.

601
00:43:55,841 --> 00:44:02,360
Speaker 1: Then we'll have the spoiler line and we'll talk about all three of these animations again in excruciating meaningful detail.

602
00:44:02,461 --> 00:44:03,931
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz right now it's.

603
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:10,679
Speaker 0: I feel like we just gave Synopses of what they are and we didn't really and we said that they were great But we didn't really discuss.

604
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:19,829
Speaker 1: You know the meanings and the messages because you didn't want to spoil what went on and there's no way to even really allude to Without spoiling these things because the points hit home really hard.

605
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:23,239
Speaker 0: That's how it works and they're very good.

606
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:25,906
Speaker 1: I mean, I Don't know what else I can say.

607
00:44:25,987 --> 00:44:27,879
Speaker 1: I can't recommend these more than I have.

608
00:44:28,684 --> 00:44:31,700
Speaker 0: I can't recommend anything Osamu Tezuka has ever done.

609
00:44:32,141 --> 00:44:41,209
Speaker 0: you know, I mean in my eyes there are two guys Osamu Tezuka and Will Eisner and those two guys are pretty much the only guys that were that good ever at.

610
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,746
Speaker 0: you know, comicking and such and Their works are actually very similar.

611
00:44:47,047 --> 00:44:57,140
Speaker 0: and yet you should do everything you can to read and Ingest everything that has been created by Tezuka and or Eisner.

612
00:44:58,401 --> 00:45:04,480
Speaker 1: Now moving on to the anime related meta bits since we can't talk about these animations anymore without spoiling them.

613
00:45:04,781 --> 00:45:11,915
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm one for all of you who are going to Otakon our geek nights live show Unless something changes will be at 10 a.m.

614
00:45:12,136 --> 00:45:14,969
Speaker 0: On Sunday We don't know in one of the panel rooms.

615
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,666
Speaker 1: Yes, we don't know which panel room there will be flyers Everywhere.

616
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:20,819
Speaker 1: we will announce it multiple times on the show.

617
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:35,278
Speaker 0: Yep, just look at your Otakon schedule and it will say Podcasting panel in one of the panel rooms on Sunday at 10. in addition will be all over the con Doing interviews doing things and we will arrange probably all sorts of things at the con.

618
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:37,126
Speaker 0: right now This is all tentative.

619
00:45:37,387 --> 00:45:44,188
Speaker 0: by the way, you know the Thursday pool party At some point, you know some board gaming.

620
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,000
Speaker 1: we're going to bust into the rave and bust up some ravers.

621
00:45:48,483 --> 00:45:50,013
Speaker 1: Maybe I think we will.

622
00:45:50,034 --> 00:45:55,450
Speaker 0: I will at least Of course the late night Saturday horrible movie.

623
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:55,892
Speaker 1: Yes.

624
00:45:55,972 --> 00:45:58,660
Speaker 1: We want as much of a posse as we can possibly get.

625
00:45:58,761 --> 00:45:59,615
Speaker 1: We're gonna make a ruckus.

626
00:46:01,282 --> 00:46:03,892
Speaker 0: The musical guests who knows if we will enjoy them or not.

627
00:46:03,912 --> 00:46:04,314
Speaker 0: We'll see.

628
00:46:04,435 --> 00:46:05,057
Speaker 1: I think we will.

629
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:13,039
Speaker 0: I think we will The cosplay which you probably leaning towards not going to to enjoy the rest of the con while it's all empty and airy.

630
00:46:13,244 --> 00:46:20,226
Speaker 1: Yep I want to send at least one geek nights correspondent or front row crew member in to see how the cosplay works in this newer in This new venue.

631
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I am kind of curious.

632
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:30,765
Speaker 0: I'm thinking maybe what I'll do is I'll go to it for a port like the early part and then leave and Then you know before it's over.

633
00:46:31,287 --> 00:46:31,447
Speaker 1: Yep.

634
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:32,230
Speaker 1: Also.

635
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,700
Speaker 1: I want to plug while I'm here the fact that I'm also.

636
00:46:35,981 --> 00:46:40,520
Speaker 1: There's not Scott just me and the other Scott are doing at what we've done for the past.

637
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,253
Speaker 1: God four years at Otacon and also at almost every other con.

638
00:46:44,273 --> 00:46:52,560
Speaker 1: we've ever been to the anime club summit Which has gotten bigger and bigger over the years and it's at prime time like 1 30 in the afternoon on Saturday.

639
00:46:53,023 --> 00:47:01,347
Speaker 0: So if you care about anime clubs running anime clubs If you're in an anime club, if you want to be in an anime club anything to do with anime clubs Go to the anime club summit.

640
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:02,251
Speaker 0: We'll be there for sure.

641
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:06,048
Speaker 0: We're always there at any con We go to all the time.

642
00:47:06,068 --> 00:47:16,168
Speaker 1: I mean not to inflate our egos anymore But we're all really honestly pretty much experts at what it takes to run fan clubs Basically any kind.

643
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:26,318
Speaker 1: we just happen to have done it with anime Yeah and all the sorts of ramifications around that in social clubs and you know being a master of ceremonies and public speaking and all that and I think we put on a good show.

644
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:34,682
Speaker 0: So if you care about that or you just want to see us before Sunday and you couldn't find us by other means Anime club summit.

645
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:35,224
Speaker 1: Yep.

646
00:47:35,725 --> 00:47:42,060
Speaker 1: Also last but not least anime world order our first friend podcast and also a very good anime podcast.

647
00:47:42,762 --> 00:47:49,480
Speaker 1: They said some things we disagreed with on a recent episode and we have sent them some audio feedback some incredibly long audio feedback.

648
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,912
Speaker 0: What's long 16 minutes long something like that?

649
00:47:51,992 --> 00:47:53,500
Speaker 1: I assume they'll edit it at least a little bit.

650
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:01,128
Speaker 0: I hope they'll edit it because if they play all 16 minutes of it, that's just being too insane except You know cuz they they go on forever.

651
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:02,193
Speaker 1: they do like two-hour shows.

652
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,757
Speaker 0: they can handle that they do Especially since they don't have to talk for those 16 minutes.

653
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,602
Speaker 0: But good God if we will be taking up like a significant like 5% of their show We're just us.

654
00:48:11,903 --> 00:48:13,790
Speaker 1: if we did a once a week podcast.

655
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:14,813
Speaker 1: Good God.

656
00:48:15,114 --> 00:48:16,720
Speaker 0: Oh god, it would be five hours long.

657
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,852
Speaker 1: It would also be like the most well researched crazy thing you could imagine.

658
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:22,825
Speaker 0: Oh god, maybe we should one week Just do one episode.

659
00:48:23,006 --> 00:48:23,789
Speaker 1: That would be nuts.

660
00:48:24,171 --> 00:48:24,693
Speaker 0: I would be not.

661
00:48:24,713 --> 00:48:26,200
Speaker 1: that would have to be one hell of an episode.

662
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:32,859
Speaker 0: No, I imagine it would just be a bunch of episodes together with like five news is five things of the day each.

663
00:48:33,962 --> 00:48:36,715
Speaker 1: We could just do an episode on like politics or something at that point.

664
00:48:37,197 --> 00:48:39,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know I'm getting hiccups.

665
00:48:39,204 --> 00:48:40,569
Speaker 0: It's time to end this episode.

666
00:48:40,629 --> 00:48:48,474
Speaker 1: All right, but once again check out anime world order, especially we'll warn you again But we may or may not be appearing on it in non live form.

667
00:48:49,116 --> 00:48:59,440
Speaker 0: Oh, oh tomorrow the episode of geek nights that we will record and air tomorrow is Going to be an ask rim and Scott anything episode.

668
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:04,564
Speaker 0: We've gotten a lot of questions already and we're getting more questions by the minute But the time is running out.

669
00:49:05,046 --> 00:49:18,000
Speaker 0: submit your questions either at the front row crew forums at front row crew comm slash forum or Email us at geek nights at front row crew comm with your questions and we will answer them on the show tomorrow.

670
00:49:18,482 --> 00:49:33,374
Speaker 0: You're running out of time to submit your questions and we've gotten a wide variety of interesting questions And there is also a possibility a pretty good possibility tomorrow that we are going to be on Ian Levinson's podcast talking about anime.

671
00:49:33,414 --> 00:49:34,379
Speaker 0: next some more.

672
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:40,507
Speaker 1: Yep, now I'll note that we kind of made fun of him and his panel a little bit on our previous episodes But he's a cool guy.

673
00:49:40,628 --> 00:49:47,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, he is a cool guy And I think his podcast is just called geek speak and I think it's geek speak geek comm if I recall correctly Speaking.

674
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:59,062
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll let you know if and when that episode actually goes up if you want to hear us talk more about anime next on Someone else's show.

675
00:49:59,744 --> 00:50:01,769
Speaker 1: and of course one tiny final bit.

676
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:11,220
Speaker 1: while we failed to interview Jim Vowels con chair of Otacon live He was gracious enough to answer many of the questions we and our listeners had in our forums.

677
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:19,759
Speaker 1: So you if you have any interest in what Jim Vowels the top dog for Otacon 2006 has to say and you haven't been to the forums yet go in.

678
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:22,047
Speaker 1: Read all the things he's written.

679
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:22,710
Speaker 1: He wrote a lot.

680
00:50:23,031 --> 00:50:28,117
Speaker 0: He wrote a lot and it's very good Yep, and if we had interviewed him, he would have said a lot more.

681
00:50:28,137 --> 00:50:33,400
Speaker 1: Yep Wait, and we're still gonna try to interview and we might have to wait until after Otacon is over for various reasons.

682
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,571
Speaker 0: I think after Otacon is over we're gonna get like the ultimate interview.

683
00:50:36,592 --> 00:50:37,676
Speaker 0: That's what I'm thinking.

684
00:50:38,097 --> 00:50:38,860
Speaker 1: I got a lot of asking.

685
00:50:39,342 --> 00:50:40,786
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, especially after Otacon.

686
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:42,552
Speaker 0: We'll just be adding questions to the list.

687
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:43,957
Speaker 0: Like how was the con?

688
00:50:44,238 --> 00:50:44,900
Speaker 0: blah blah blah.

689
00:50:45,423 --> 00:50:46,913
Speaker 0: What was your favorite thing at the con?

690
00:50:46,993 --> 00:50:48,000
Speaker 0: anything crazy happened?

691
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,526
Speaker 0: You know, did you meet any cool guests?

692
00:50:50,687 --> 00:50:52,253
Speaker 0: who was cool, etc, etc.

693
00:50:52,614 --> 00:50:54,380
Speaker 1: plus also regarding the panel?

694
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,262
Speaker 1: We're doing a geek ed.

695
00:50:55,543 --> 00:50:58,733
Speaker 1: got a geek nights at Otacon the podcasting geek nights panel.

696
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:00,719
Speaker 1: all you podcasters out there.

697
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:12,294
Speaker 1: Come to the panel and be in the audience and bring as many people as you can because one We're obviously gonna let other podcasters give shout outs, of course I mean obviously like what kind of assholes would it be to not?

698
00:51:12,596 --> 00:51:17,119
Speaker 1: Yep, and to Podcasting isn't that big outside of podcasting?

699
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:18,223
Speaker 0: I know right.

700
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,949
Speaker 1: so get a crowd there.

701
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:29,980
Speaker 1: if we get a big enough crowd and people wonder what the hell's going on We'll all be able to promote podcasting as a media much more efficiently and we'll probably all get a bunch of new listeners.

702
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:32,776
Speaker 0: I think that's something that we'll talk more about at the panel itself.

703
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:38,836
Speaker 0: Is that Podcasting's most of its promotion seems to be promos which are played on other podcasts.

704
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:53,360
Speaker 0: people who aren't into podcasts at all don't get into them and all podcasts either seem to be You know podcasters themselves seem to be the biggest listeners and then there's listeners who listen to a bunch of podcasts.

705
00:51:53,882 --> 00:51:59,267
Speaker 0: And then there are people who listen to just one podcast that has to do with their specific Interest and they don't listen to any other shows.

706
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:05,295
Speaker 1: or then there was me who did a crazy big Podcast in terms of quantity of episodes and didn't listen to anything.

707
00:52:05,315 --> 00:52:13,605
Speaker 1: didn't listen to any podcast Other than two episodes of anime world order and one episode of artist alley until just now when I bought an iPod Until just now finally gonna have.

708
00:52:13,626 --> 00:52:22,855
Speaker 0: but so if we get a lot of podcasters together at Otacon we can promote Podcasting as a whole and get people who know nothing about podcasting into podcasting.

709
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:27,197
Speaker 0: and of course and an anime con They're gonna want anime podcasts, which is us and you.

710
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:35,300
Speaker 1: Plus if we have a bunch of podcasters together after the panel No good can come of that and I think we will form a posse and go cause trouble somewhere.

711
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:38,812
Speaker 0: Yes We will definitely have the podcast posse of awesome and maybe have.

712
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:41,000
Speaker 0: maybe we should have like a podcast party or something.

713
00:52:41,643 --> 00:52:45,158
Speaker 1: One of the members of anime world order is coming to Otacon.

714
00:52:45,178 --> 00:52:46,424
Speaker 0: two of them I think are well.

715
00:52:46,504 --> 00:52:48,392
Speaker 1: one of them is as his first Otacon.

716
00:52:48,492 --> 00:52:49,135
