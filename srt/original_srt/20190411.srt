1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,188
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, April 11th, 2019.

2
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:12,091
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,175
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:14,760
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,180
Speaker 0: We have a special guest, Judith, and we're gonna talk about water in the ceiling.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:20,892
Speaker 1: Should've said "I'm

7
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:21,098
Speaker 1: Judith.".

8
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,620
Speaker 0: No, we don't let her talk in that part.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,918
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

10
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,780
Speaker 0: Alright, Judith, you wanna say "I'm Judith"?

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,300
Speaker 1: Don't let him silence you.

12
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:29,827
Speaker 0: No, you can say it.

13
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:30,979
Speaker 0: You can yell it.

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,639
Speaker 0: I don't want to.

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,021
Speaker 0: Okay.

16
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:39,360
Speaker 0: So, uh, my news, I'll get right into it because it's also my opening bit.

17
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:45,120
Speaker 0: You have all seen, I'm sure, the video of the woman almost getting killed by an axe that she threw.

18
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,100
Speaker 1: I did not see it until you just showed it to me.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,481
Speaker 0: Yeah.

20
00:00:47,702 --> 00:01:01,120
Speaker 0: So, it was making the rounds, it's a thing, and I realized that Scott is unaware of the fact that white people, particularly tech bro white people, are weirdly obsessed with axe throwing as a fake hobby lately.

21
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:04,471
Speaker 1: I mean, I knew that axe throwing was a sport.

22
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:10,679
Speaker 1: in the same way that, you know, all those other crazy sports like that thing where, like, you carry your wife and all, you know, I know a lot of crazy sports.

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:25,160
Speaker 1: Right, I knew that axe throwing was an existing sport, but I did not know that it recently became popular or that anyone was doing it on any scale anywhere other than, of course, you know, the one time a year someone's backyard, they have the axe throwing championship.

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:34,340
Speaker 0: Yup, so like, after over the last year or so, a bunch of businesses sprung up that are, they treated it as like this hardcore cool sport that is also a team building exercise.

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,120
Speaker 1: Axe dodging is hardcore, axe throwing is not.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,960
Speaker 0: Well, this woman turned axe throwing into axe dodging.

27
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:40,658
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:48,740
Speaker 0: Because axe throwing sucks, it's not fun, I've done it, it's boring, it's hard, just play darts, and she throws an axe that almost hits her in the face.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,561
Speaker 0: So,

30
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:50,304
Speaker 1: I was

31
00:01:50,444 --> 00:02:15,701
Speaker 0: already keyed, like, keyed into the fact that axe throwing is this weird white people thing that happens suddenly, but this video went viral, and on my way out of work today, I'm in the elevator, and I got stuck on the local, and the elevator was filled with a bunch of people on some other team who are themselves all going after work to axe throw as a team building exercise, and yes, 100% of them were white and under 30.

32
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:26,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta say though, as much as the fault of this is due to doing the stupid sport of axe throwing, I must say, the design of this axe throwing arena is very poor.

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,358
Speaker 0: They're all like this.

34
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:34,180
Speaker 1: Right, underneath the axe target, which is appropriately a giant piece of wood, is a rubberized surface, it appears, of some kind.

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,880
Speaker 0: It would not matter what was there.

36
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:49,143
Speaker 1: No, you could have, say, a foot, like, inch deep pit of, like, bits of stuff, and then that would basically, if any axe landed in that pit, it would just sort of sink into it, like, Right?

37
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,340
Speaker 1: Much like a person jumping into a ball pit.

38
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:57,620
Speaker 1: You would need smaller bits than ball pit balls, but you could use, like, ground-up astroturf or something.

39
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,260
Speaker 0: I gotta say this, the reason why it looks so shitty and why it seems so close is real simple.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,820
Speaker 0: Most people are not strong, or athletic, or coordinated.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,878
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it was farther, no one would throw an axe that far, they'd be like, "He would never reach the

42
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,220
Speaker 1: target.".

43
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, the moral is, axe throwing- Axes are heavy, you need to be strong to throw them.

44
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:23,320
Speaker 0: If you ever see an establishment that sells axe throwing as its primary thing, it is an establishment to be avoided because it is not fun, just play darts.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, there is one, there is only one merit I can see to axe throwing above dart throwing, right?

46
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,100
Speaker 1: Is when you throw a dart, you throw it pointy side forward.

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,780
Speaker 0: You don't have- I throw it fins forward because I know what the fuck I'm doing.

48
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:44,140
Speaker 1: The point is, it has fins that keep it straight, so even if your aim is bad, the pointy part is gonna go into the target.

49
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,140
Speaker 0: I mean, we were playing darts at the New Year's party, and only a few people hit the wall.

50
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:51,520
Speaker 1: But if you hit the wall, the pointy side went into the wall, is the point, right?

51
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,020
Speaker 1: With an axe, when you throw an axe, it rotates head over handle, like whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh.

52
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:14,100
Speaker 1: So even if you're right on target, like dead on bullseye, and you have the strength to get it there, you also, it does have the additional skill challenge of controlling the rotation so that the pointy side is forward when it reaches the target, and that is the, I think, only merit for axe throwing above darts.

53
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:23,280
Speaker 0: The sad part is that most people I've seen, 'cause I've done, I've thrown axes before, is most people cannot even get the axe to stick into any target because they're just not strong enough.

54
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:26,420
Speaker 0: Even if they're like five feet away from the target.

55
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:34,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to put enough power into the axe, or even if the sharp port hits the wood, it still needs to have enough velocity, momentum to get in there, right?

56
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:42,880
Speaker 0: The thing I'm terrified of is I'm really worried that there are people who will do this, and not realize it's boring, and try to make it their hobby.

57
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:51,579
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone makes it their hobby, I think it looks to me, based on what I've learned in the past, less than an hour since I discovered that people are doing this.

58
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,620
Speaker 0: I just don't know how you avoid, like, white people, pop culture nonsense.

59
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,180
Speaker 1: It feels like a birthday party situation where you rent the place out, you do it once for fun, and you never do it again.

60
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,078
Speaker 0: Oh, these places will-.

61
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,960
Speaker 1: I don't think it's a rock climbing situation where people, or bowling, where there's like a league.

62
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,680
Speaker 1: There might be a few people in the league, but almost nobody.

63
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,900
Speaker 0: The axe throwing thing will be gone within two years.

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,440
Speaker 1: I feel like there's more people in the ski ball league in Brooklyn than in the axe throwing league.

65
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,639
Speaker 0: I think you are correct.

66
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:18,199
Speaker 0: So what do you have for some news?

67
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,180
Speaker 1: Oh, so the NHL draft was, what, when was it, recently?

68
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,552
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what, you know what matters?

69
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:25,199
Speaker 0: Number two!

70
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:25,878
Speaker 0: Number two!

71
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,496
Speaker 0: Number two!

72
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:37,059
Speaker 1: And it's the perfect year to get number two, because basically there's two people who are at the top to get to pick, and people are arguing over which one should be one or two, and- A one for you, a one for me.

73
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,639
Speaker 1: So someone else has the difficult task of choosing which one to take.

74
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,029
Speaker 1: It's autochess.

75
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:43,300
Speaker 0: It's autochess for humans.

76
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,520
Speaker 1: Number two is basically as good as number one, if not better, because someone else makes the decision for you.

77
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,619
Speaker 1: You just take the other guy, and then the quality of draft picks falls off precipitously after number two.

78
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,680
Speaker 1: So, woo woo, that's great.

79
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,600
Speaker 0: So I've watched that part of the draft before, but I never actually looked at what Scott linked me to.

80
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:16,699
Speaker 1: Right, so if you watch the NHL draft on TV, they try to turn it into a televisable, suspenseful event, where they read off the draft picks, the rankings from lowest to highest, and then at the end they tell you who got the first pick, right?

81
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:37,320
Speaker 1: But here is a video of the actual draft, the mechanics of it being conducted, which, even if you don't care about sports, if you're a nerd who cares about games, this is fascinating, because it's a camera, it's a video of the entire procedure, and that never cuts away, so you know there's no shenanigans, right?

82
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:58,840
Speaker 1: And not only can you see the great lengths they have gone through to make sure that is a completely fair lottery, which are fascinating mechanisms, if not the craziest, they're pretty, you could figure them out if you're a nerd, but they're still pretty good, is the great lengths they go through to prove to anyone watching that it's not fixed, right?

83
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,380
Speaker 1: It's like, I could easily make something that no one could cheat at, right?

84
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:06,500
Speaker 1: But then to prove that no one has cheated is like another level.

85
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,219
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's a pretty cool thing to watch, and I think I'll just be watching this in the future years, even though...

86
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,052
Speaker 0: I'll watch this instead of the televised one.

87
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,559
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, but you won't see this until after they've already announced.

88
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:20,279
Speaker 0: I could just wait.

89
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:24,460
Speaker 1: It's gonna be, you know, but it's only if you care about spoilers, right?

90
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,560
Speaker 1: It's like, this is still entertaining to watch regardless of knowing who won.

91
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:41,740
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's time for... Things of the Day!

92
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:51,399
Speaker 0: So, you may remember a long time ago, we found this video that was explaining how a differential gear works, and we were oddly obsessed with it.

93
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:52,839
Speaker 1: Uh, for like a day.

94
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:58,620
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but like, we showed it at Kineticon, like when we needed filler content and a panel a couple times.

95
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,059
Speaker 1: Okay, that applies to a lot of things.

96
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,160
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, so there was, I guess, just a really good video.

97
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:08,472
Speaker 0: I found a very similar video that has a bonus point of.

98
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:17,780
Speaker 0: it's got a beautifully rendered animated Archimedes sneering at us in the fashion of a story from North America, and then...

99
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,820
Speaker 1: It looks like the dead from the story of North America.

100
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,100
Speaker 0: He does, but crossed with Poseidon, may he not kill me in a boat someday.

101
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:32,158
Speaker 1: I mean, pretty much any white dude, white beard, white toga, you could just say, "Oh yeah, it's fucking, I don't know,

102
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:33,039
Speaker 1: Aristotle.".

103
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,799
Speaker 0: No, no, no, the reason I would say it's Poseidon is the sneer.

104
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,398
Speaker 1: That is a Poseidon-looking sneer.

105
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:43,100
Speaker 0: Julius Caesar wouldn't sneer like that.

106
00:08:43,664 --> 00:08:45,298
Speaker 1: You could name any Greek or Roman Zeus.

107
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,300
Speaker 0: There are only two beings that can sneer like that.

108
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,420
Speaker 0: The dead from the story of North America.

109
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,760
Speaker 0: The story from North America.

110
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,709
Speaker 0: It's Agamemnon.

111
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:53,840
Speaker 1: It could be anybody.

112
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,419
Speaker 0: I don't think Agamemnon would sneer like that.

113
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,999
Speaker 0: I think he had more of a haughty look.

114
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,118
Speaker 0: This is a Poseidon sneer.

115
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:12,200
Speaker 0: Anyway, this video is 9 minutes and 40 seconds of the same thing as that other video that explained how a differential gear works, and it talks about how transmissions work, because really a transmission is just a bunch of circular levers.

116
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,579
Speaker 0: And it's a really, really good video.

117
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:22,000
Speaker 0: And it's really, really, really old, because the fundamental way a transmission works did not change until electric cars.

118
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,573
Speaker 1: Nope.

119
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,857
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

120
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:31,219
Speaker 1: So, some people went to McDonald's, or in this case, Macca's, which is what they call it, I guess, wherever they're from.

121
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:32,879
Speaker 0: Royale with cheese.

122
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:39,440
Speaker 1: It is a place that I never go, and I haven't eaten there since I can't even remember the last time I ate there.

123
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:40,938
Speaker 0: Last year.

124
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:48,180
Speaker 1: The last time I distinctly remember eating there was when I was, in the year 2000, I went to one in Israel and only ate ice cream.

125
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,860
Speaker 1: Because apparently I was told the ice cream there was special, also it was cheap.

126
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:03,774
Speaker 0: The last time I ate at McDonald's was in January of this year, when I went on a ski trip, and I was in Times Square waiting for the ski bus, and the McDonald's was there, and a part of my brain said, "McDonald's.

127
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:04,697
Speaker 0: McDonald's.

128
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:05,500
Speaker 0: McDonald's!".

129
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,739
Speaker 1: My brain never says that.

130
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,020
Speaker 0: So I went and got a McDonald's breakfast.

131
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:16,080
Speaker 1: My brain sees two golden arches, and it just imagines, like, piss, two people peeing into the central location.

132
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:20,039
Speaker 0: That was oddly specific.

133
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,496
Speaker 1: So it else is two golden arches.

134
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:26,140
Speaker 1: It's not good.

135
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,520
Speaker 0: So I had already gotten to the point to where I cannot eat McDonald's regular food without literally getting sick.

136
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:34,660
Speaker 1: I cannot smell a McDonald's without feeling nauseous.

137
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,360
Speaker 0: But I could still eat the McDonald's breakfast, and in emergencies that was an acceptable option.

138
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,259
Speaker 1: I mean, they have an apple there, I think, right?

139
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,260
Speaker 1: And they had the cookies that come in a bag, and I could get a beverage that's sealed.

140
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,280
Speaker 0: So I ordered a McDonald's, like, McMuffin.

141
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,796
Speaker 1: Maybe I could eat the chicken nuggets.

142
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:49,978
Speaker 1: Maybe.

143
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:50,845
Speaker 0: And a hash brown.

144
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:51,880
Speaker 0: And a coffee.

145
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,880
Speaker 0: The coffee was so hot I could not drink it, and then when it was cold, it tasted like ass, so I didn't drink it, and I threw it away.

146
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:05,780
Speaker 0: The hash brown was good while it was hot, and the moment it became cold, it tasted like poison.

147
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:11,320
Speaker 0: And I threw the McMuffin away after two bites, because that shit is disgusting.

148
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:13,460
Speaker 0: I am now beyond McDonald's.

149
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,460
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is, these people at this Maccas, there is a digital ordering system, which is pretty cool.

150
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,227
Speaker 0: Which I approve of.

151
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:21,240
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk to a human.

152
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just go up, you push some buttons, just like Wawa, or any of those other places.

153
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,759
Speaker 0: Shake Shack has this now, too.

154
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, you go up, push the buttons, you wait, then they give you your order, right?

155
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,920
Speaker 0: Oh my, you would not believe how many people, there's a Shake Shack kind of by my office.

156
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,540
Speaker 0: There's always people lined up at this place.

157
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,219
Speaker 0: So many of them are lined up to talk to a person, because they won't use the kiosk.

158
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:50,980
Speaker 1: So, what these people discovered is a bug in the system, whereby you can get the dollar burger, and you customize the dollar burger to remove the actual beef patty from it, because you can customize your order, right?

159
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,420
Speaker 1: You can be like, no ketchup, yes ketchup, add onion, you know, all those options.

160
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,540
Speaker 0: Give me more pickles, more pickles.

161
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,280
Speaker 1: All that stuff you can customize, you can actually remove the burger itself.

162
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,940
Speaker 1: It is a fully customizable thing, it was programmed well.

163
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:13,380
Speaker 1: If you remove the burger patty from the dollar burger, you are left with something that costs negative ten cents.

164
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:21,760
Speaker 0: Because if you get a normal burger that costs more than a dollar, they subtract a dollar twenty, if you're making it garbo-vegetarian, as in just a burger without a button.

165
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,700
Speaker 1: Maybe you want to provide your own burger.

166
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:24,180
Speaker 0: Maybe.

167
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,756
Speaker 1: You don't know.

168
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:28,880
Speaker 0: Well, I'm glad that's your example lately for everything, is maybe you want to provide your own.

169
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,420
Speaker 1: They're a legitimate situation.

170
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:32,619
Speaker 0: BYOB, bring your own beef.

171
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,080
Speaker 0: Right.

172
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:50,246
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, what they did is they added, like, ten negative cost burgers to their bag, and then they added a positive cost burger with a patty, and the fine employees of McDonald's, who were not paid enough to give any shits,

173
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,755
Speaker 0: of course, filled up their

174
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,300
Speaker 1: order exactly as specified.

175
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:58,260
Speaker 1: A whole bunch of buns with almost nothing on them.

176
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,419
Speaker 0: The best part is when they open the bag and they're like, "Oh my god, they made

177
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:01,480
Speaker 0: it.".

178
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,938
Speaker 1: And then one real actual dollar burger, and they paid no money to this McDonald's.

179
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:07,560
Speaker 1: They got free food.

180
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:16,720
Speaker 0: There's something magical, because I'm all very much of the mind that if you pay someone minimum wage, they are obligated to give you minimum effort.

181
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,108
Speaker 0: Yeah.

182
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:26,120
Speaker 0: So my hat is off to the McDonald's employees, who chose to not in any way question this, and my hat is off to these kids, who are geniuses.

183
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:33,880
Speaker 1: It's a lot like the kids who use their phones to video record the dealer no-deal machine.

184
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:34,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, yep.

185
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:37,340
Speaker 1: That was a previous thing of the day.

186
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,440
Speaker 0: So now, our guest, Judith.

187
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:40,919
Speaker 2: Hello.

188
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,040
Speaker 0: You, seeing how we do things of the day, have a thing of the day for us to bring to the table.

189
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,655
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

190
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,000
Speaker 2: Well, playoff hockey begins for the Boston Bruins, my favorite team, today.

191
00:13:52,162 --> 00:13:55,640
Speaker 2: So they posted a video to try and get people pumped.

192
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,480
Speaker 0: Wait, is that blood?

193
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,199
Speaker 2: That is blood.

194
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,770
Speaker 1: They need to get people pumped?

195
00:13:58,952 --> 00:13:59,800
Speaker 1: People aren't pumped enough?

196
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:01,620
Speaker 0: That's just what their Twitter is for, is to get people pumped.

197
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,580
Speaker 0: Oh, that is literally just blood going down the drain.

198
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:16,980
Speaker 2: So they posted this inspirational video with the hashtag #InOurBlood, and it has lots of clips of hockey players and people playing hockey, like you would think, but also clips of lions and Dobermans and an occasional bear and some tanks.

199
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:22,117
Speaker 0: There's a mobile rocket artillery launcher here, and then a hockey fight, and the word

200
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:22,398
Speaker 0: "fight.".

201
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,515
Speaker 2: And it's awkwardly cut into all this hockey footage, including blood going down a drain, blood going down someone's face, the word

202
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:29,978
Speaker 2: "bleed.".

203
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:31,400
Speaker 2: Yeah, you just saw the wolf.

204
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,700
Speaker 0: Oh, that wolf is really mad.

205
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:33,420
Speaker 2: It's a really mad wolf.

206
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,199
Speaker 1: That looks like a fake wolf.

207
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:34,851
Speaker 0: That's real.

208
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,740
Speaker 0: That wolf doesn't look mad.

209
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,991
Speaker 0: He looks like he's like, "I'm going to bite this camera,".

210
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:40,840
Speaker 0: but this other wolf looks mad.

211
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:41,857
Speaker 0: Yeah.

212
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:48,540
Speaker 2: So if you either want to feel ashamed to be a Boston Bruins fan or even more pumped about it, check out this video.

213
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,198
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

214
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,200
Speaker 1: Is it possible for extreme masculinity to go so overboard that it wraps around to where it's acceptable?

215
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,400
Speaker 1: Well, I mean- It's like it's so toxic that it becomes silly and is no longer toxic.

216
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:11,360
Speaker 0: Well, it's kind of like how Top Gun was intended to be hyper hetero masculine and ended up being the literally most homoerotic thing humanity's ever created.

217
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:15,540
Speaker 0: This video is- I want to remix this video.

218
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,133
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

219
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,658
Speaker 2: It's already remixed.

220
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:21,800
Speaker 0: I don't even know what music it goes to, nor do I care.

221
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,380
Speaker 2: Me neither.

222
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,620
Speaker 2: I just watched it on silent.

223
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:37,480
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, I apologize deeply, but I chose, based on a lot of thought, that we are going to read a book that I read once in high school and thought my high school brain thought it was phenomenal.

224
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:42,119
Speaker 0: Other adult humans who- That's not saying much.

225
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,097
Speaker 0: Other adult humans whose opinions Scott and I both trust have- Oh, really?

226
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:54,340
Speaker 0: Alex has also said this book is actually good based on memory.

227
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,359
Speaker 1: Oh, it is high school.

228
00:15:56,903 --> 00:15:57,348
Speaker 1: High school.

229
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,440
Speaker 1: Alex says it was good.

230
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:15,460
Speaker 0: So I'm really curious to find out if High School Rim had taste because I remember that this Planescape branded Dungeons and Dragons canonical book, Pages of Pain, I remember it being good and I remember it being phenomenal compared to every other branded material.

231
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:27,440
Speaker 0: I like those nonsense elf books where a bunch of elves do their elf shit in Faerun and I remember this book being a lot- You mean the fanfiction that Rim would have written had it not already existed for him to simply read it?

232
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:34,500
Speaker 0: Why would I write fanfiction when I just played an elf among elves in my many year running D&D campaign where we went around doing elf shit?

233
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,922
Speaker 0: Our D&D campaign was 90%.

234
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:40,800
Speaker 0: The elves are having court because they're mad about other elves.

235
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,959
Speaker 0: And then he'd role play dinner.

236
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:45,779
Speaker 0: That was my high school life.

237
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:48,878
Speaker 0: Dinner of Sun Chips and Dr.

238
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:49,100
Speaker 1: Pepper?

239
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,395
Speaker 0: Sun Chips, Dr.

240
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:50,680
Speaker 0: Pepper.

241
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,880
Speaker 1: What else did elves eat for dinner?

242
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,880
Speaker 0: Pretty much, well, I assume it was only Sun Elves that ate the Sun Chips.

243
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:59,200
Speaker 0: I was a Moon Elf, fuck those Sun Elves and their bullshit.

244
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,676
Speaker 1: You weren't a medical elf with your Dr.

245
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:00,858
Speaker 1: Pepper?

246
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,020
Speaker 0: They stole the crown from the Moon Elf and Queen.

247
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,551
Speaker 0: I digress, I'm still mad about that.

248
00:17:05,955 --> 00:17:06,359
Speaker 0: Anyway.

249
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,738
Speaker 1: Toblerone for dinner for the elves?

250
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:22,512
Speaker 0: So join us for the next Geek Nights book club where instead of reading The Odyssey or The Space Odyssey, we're going to read something about not Odysseus, not Perseus, but potentially about Poseidon and Theseus.

251
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:29,240
Speaker 0: that is set in Planescape, which technically means it is in the same universe as Kelvin Blackstaff.

252
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:32,240
Speaker 0: We are reading Troy Denning's Pages of Pain.

253
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:34,600
Speaker 1: Same universe as every D&D thing ever?

254
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,000
Speaker 0: Yes, except Ravenloft because Ravenloft is actually walled off in its own demiplane that is not accessible from the rest of the universe.

255
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,703
Speaker 1: What?

256
00:17:42,723 --> 00:17:44,219
Speaker 1: I didn't know about that.

257
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ravenloft is- That sounds not true.

258
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,700
Speaker 0: Ravenloft is walled off from the entire universe and it's its own thing for canonical reasons.

259
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,498
Speaker 0: Because Count von Straad fucked up.

260
00:17:58,221 --> 00:17:58,433
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

261
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:03,520
Speaker 0: Wait, you sound like you're curious about the details of how this goes down.

262
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:11,804
Speaker 1: No, I just do not believe that this is a thing, or I'm pretty sure that someone has probably undone this thing and that it was- No, no, no.

263
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:14,479
Speaker 0: So you know how every Ravenloft campaign goes?

264
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:21,919
Speaker 0: It's you got pulled there somehow and because this place is walled off from the rest of the universe- No, no one starts there.

265
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:22,792
Speaker 0: Why not?

266
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:24,486
Speaker 0: I guess you could.

267
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:31,919
Speaker 0: Usually people play in like Forgotten Realms, then oh shit, someone pulled you into Ravenloft, now you're fucked, there's no way back.

268
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,700
Speaker 0: You're living here and when you die, you're just still here because it's the undead garbage place.

269
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:38,837
Speaker 1: Alright.

270
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:52,120
Speaker 0: Anyway, we're here to talk about water in the ceiling because as all of us in this room have experienced, if you live in New York City, at some point in your life, water is going- Not even New York City.

271
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,980
Speaker 1: Not even New York State.

272
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,599
Speaker 1: If you live in houses.

273
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:56,280
Speaker 0: If you live in apartments.

274
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,200
Speaker 0: If you live in apartments.

275
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:58,838
Speaker 1: Shelters.

276
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,949
Speaker 0: Apartments where there are other apartments above you, you have experienced at some point, water coming through your ceiling.

277
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:10,520
Speaker 0: and if you have not experienced it, you should go check because there might be water coming through your ceiling.

278
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,620
Speaker 1: It is really shocking how many people and how common it is to have water in the ceiling.

279
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,312
Speaker 0: Yup.

280
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,656
Speaker 0: Emily even brought it up at work and everyone was like, "Yup, that has happened to

281
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:19,777
Speaker 0: me.".

282
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:23,620
Speaker 0: You get that like bulb in the ceiling dry water.

283
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,160
Speaker 1: So hopefully we can connect with all the listeners with our water in the ceiling episode.

284
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,560
Speaker 0: Let's start with our oldest story and then let's get Judith's story and then I'll tell the most recent set of stories.

285
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,964
Speaker 0: Scott's got his story too.

286
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:39,420
Speaker 0: that was also recent, but the original story, the reason for all this, and Judith, just interrupt us whenever you want.

287
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,018
Speaker 0: We just keep going unless someone yells at us.

288
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:43,637
Speaker 2: We were at RIT.

289
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:45,777
Speaker 0: There I was.

290
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,339
Speaker 0: I was laying in bed.

291
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,439
Speaker 0: Scott was laying in bed.

292
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,900
Speaker 0: We were probably arguing about something.

293
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:50,578
Speaker 1: We heard noise.

294
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:51,840
Speaker 0: Yup, we heard noise.

295
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:52,737
Speaker 1: Dripping noise.

296
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:53,899
Speaker 0: Drip, drip, drip.

297
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,740
Speaker 0: I'm trying to ignore it, but I vaguely recall Scott was like, "That keeps dripping.

298
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:01,273
Speaker 0: That doesn't sound

299
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:01,537
Speaker 0: good.".

300
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:02,848
Speaker 0: And I didn't want to get up.

301
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:04,057
Speaker 0: and finally I'm like, "God damn

302
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:04,158
Speaker 0: it.".

303
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,820
Speaker 0: So I get up and I go into the other room and I hear the drip, drip, drip and I step and the floor is wet.

304
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:11,492
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

305
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:19,440
Speaker 0: I turn on the light and the ceiling is like there is a bubble, like a monster is pushing through the ceiling.

306
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:20,619
Speaker 0: Like a giant zit.

307
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,880
Speaker 1: I was there so I can confirm.

308
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:24,200
Speaker 0: It was impressive.

309
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:27,339
Speaker 0: There is a light fixture there that was entirely full of water.

310
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:31,997
Speaker 0: So we're like, "Uh, what the fuck do we do with

311
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:32,359
Speaker 0: this?".

312
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:37,680
Speaker 0: So I call Campus Safety and a cop comes up basically and he comes in.

313
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,680
Speaker 1: Because they don't let you call a physical plant directly.

314
00:20:41,562 --> 00:20:43,480
Speaker 1: Campus Safety is like the only number you can call for anything.

315
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,017
Speaker 0: I love this cop because he comes in and he's like, "So what's the

316
00:20:47,057 --> 00:20:47,499
Speaker 0: problem?".

317
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:50,274
Speaker 0: And we point to the ceiling and all he says is, "Oh

318
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:50,635
Speaker 0: damn.".

319
00:20:52,082 --> 00:20:58,520
Speaker 0: So then he calls physical plant and the gentleman who came to solve this problem had no idea what he was doing.

320
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:05,080
Speaker 1: Well, you know, fixing the ceiling was problem one but really the question is where the water came from.

321
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,319
Speaker 1: And where the water came from was from our neighbors who lived above us.

322
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,439
Speaker 0: Now you may recall these are the neighbors who hated us.

323
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:13,499
Speaker 1: Even though we never talked to them ever.

324
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,819
Speaker 0: Didn't even know their names, didn't even know what they looked like.

325
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:17,199
Speaker 1: I wouldn't recognize them ever.

326
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:22,980
Speaker 0: Because we had called Campus Safety on them numerous times for having wrestling matches upstairs.

327
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were basically playing the game known as Pick Up the Bowling Ball.

328
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,785
Speaker 0: At like 4 AM.

329
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:30,740
Speaker 0: That's the game where you grease your hands up and try to lift a bowling ball above your head.

330
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,260
Speaker 1: So yeah, I guess they just left their sink running and didn't notice or something like that.

331
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,940
Speaker 0: Because they were dumbasses and entirely independent of them being dumbasses.

332
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,419
Speaker 0: They were also deaf.

333
00:21:43,962 --> 00:21:46,880
Speaker 1: And it was a failure of not the plumbing.

334
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:50,740
Speaker 0: It appears that they had gotten really drunk and turned a tub on.

335
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,980
Speaker 0: And then just forgotten they had done this and flooded their entire apartment.

336
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,800
Speaker 0: Which then flooded the ceiling of our apartment.

337
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,539
Speaker 0: So Campus Safety goes up there to deal with them.

338
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,520
Speaker 0: They came back into our lives later when later that month they called Campus Safety on us.

339
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,740
Speaker 0: And accused us of trying to hack into their computers to get them expelled.

340
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:13,340
Speaker 0: Remember that was because of the Half-Life networking?

341
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:15,900
Speaker 0: And their firewall detected our Half-Life landings?

342
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,520
Speaker 1: Oh right, we were playing Half-Life 1.

343
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,400
Speaker 1: And if you try to play Half-Life 1 on the LAN using what's it called?

344
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:23,274
Speaker 1: IPX.

345
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,440
Speaker 1: IPX, which doesn't really exist anymore.

346
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, thanks Satan.

347
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:30,815
Speaker 1: Then those packets go on the whole subnet, whatever it is, VLAN, whatever.

348
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,000
Speaker 1: And their software firewalls were alerting.

349
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,678
Speaker 1: And then I guess it was our IP address because we were the ones doing...

350
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:42,800
Speaker 0: And they already hated us because we had ruined their... We fight with each other.

351
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,800
Speaker 1: I don't think they knew it was us.

352
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,140
Speaker 1: I think they just got the alert and didn't know anything about computers.

353
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,557
Speaker 1: So called, you know.

354
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I remember when we talked Campus Safety.

355
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,579
Speaker 0: He was like, "Oh, you have a history with them.

356
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:55,079
Speaker 0: Why are you antagonizing

357
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:55,180
Speaker 0: them?".

358
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,099
Speaker 0: I was like, "Uh, what?

359
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,322
Speaker 0: What?

360
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:58,093
Speaker 1: Who are these people

361
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:58,356
Speaker 1: again?".

362
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:58,893
Speaker 1: Anyway.

363
00:23:01,144 --> 00:23:03,740
Speaker 0: So the physical plant guy, they deal with that and he's standing there.

364
00:23:04,122 --> 00:23:07,620
Speaker 0: And I remember he's looking up at it and he gets up on a step ladder.

365
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:10,314
Speaker 0: And he's trying to take the light fixture off.

366
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:11,460
Speaker 0: that's completely full of water.

367
00:23:11,862 --> 00:23:18,080
Speaker 0: And I remember this sublime moment because the Campus Safety guy sees that this is going to be a disaster.

368
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,520
Speaker 0: And he kind of elbows me and gives me that look.

369
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,633
Speaker 0: The look I now recognize from New York City as, "Get a load of this guy and what's about to

370
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:25,995
Speaker 0: happen.".

371
00:23:27,604 --> 00:23:32,500
Speaker 0: And, yeah, water just comes streaming out of the ceiling in like a giant torrent.

372
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,733
Speaker 0: He drops the light fixture.

373
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:34,380
Speaker 0: It shatters.

374
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,060
Speaker 0: He almost falls off his step ladder.

375
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:38,639
Speaker 0: The ceiling starts crumbling down.

376
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:41,779
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, that sucked.

377
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,779
Speaker 1: I stayed in bed.

378
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,920
Speaker 0: Scott just laid in bed the whole time kind of sniggering and laughing at it while I'm there dealing with Campus Safety.

379
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,619
Speaker 1: You could have just been in bed and let them take care of it.

380
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:52,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, no.

381
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,720
Speaker 1: Now we had to pay them.

382
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:55,740
Speaker 0: I was like moving my books out of the way.

383
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,320
Speaker 0: I had like stuff that was going to get wet.

384
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,720
Speaker 1: I didn't put my stuff near the bathroom.

385
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, because my little bookshelf was there.

386
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,439
Speaker 1: I don't put my stuff near the bathroom.

387
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,240
Speaker 0: Also, that was not too far away from my computer.

388
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:05,760
Speaker 1: I don't put my stuff near the bathroom.

389
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:07,700
Speaker 0: I had a vested interest in dealing with that shit.

390
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:09,720
Speaker 0: And, uh, that sucked.

391
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,020
Speaker 2: Now that I think about it, I'm really lucky that never happened to me in college.

392
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,120
Speaker 2: I lived in an ancient building.

393
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:18,260
Speaker 1: A colony where we lived in college no longer exists.

394
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:18,973
Speaker 1: They demolished it.

395
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:20,580
Speaker 2: Rightfully so, it sounds like.

396
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:20,840
Speaker 1: Long ago.

397
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,540
Speaker 0: I mean, all the floors were asbestos tile.

398
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,500
Speaker 0: That place was old and dank.

399
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,940
Speaker 0: That's why we left the window open.

400
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:27,960
Speaker 1: We were also in the basement.

401
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,680
Speaker 0: We left the window open all winter and just left the heat on all winter because that was the only way to not die of mold.

402
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:36,611
Speaker 0: So, Judith, what happened to you?

403
00:24:36,691 --> 00:24:37,660
Speaker 0: Tell us your water story.

404
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:40,440
Speaker 2: Well, nowadays I still live in an ancient building.

405
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,400
Speaker 2: It was built in 1927.

406
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,380
Speaker 2: And, uh, some pipes are older than others.

407
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:47,440
Speaker 2: And we originally lived on the first floor.

408
00:24:47,881 --> 00:24:52,420
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, with the, like, boarded up, like, sealed garbage chute or coal chute?

409
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,840
Speaker 2: Yeah, we lived right near the garbage chute, which was sometimes boarded up.

410
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,258
Speaker 2: And other times it wasn't.

411
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,591
Speaker 2: It sent mice in.

412
00:24:58,632 --> 00:24:59,100
Speaker 2: It sent roaches.

413
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,100
Speaker 2: It was a great time until we got a cat.

414
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,838
Speaker 0: I remember the first time I visited you, I was like, "What's this scary

415
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:04,100
Speaker 0: door?".

416
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:06,456
Speaker 0: And I think Natalie, all she said was, "Don't

417
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:06,758
Speaker 0: ask.".

418
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:08,539
Speaker 2: Oh, that one!

419
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,159
Speaker 2: Yeah, they plastered that up and they never told us what it was.

420
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:12,213
Speaker 1: Okay.

421
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,719
Speaker 0: I just assumed that was a coal chute?

422
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,540
Speaker 2: Probably something like that or a dumbwaiter, some ancient relic.

423
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,300
Speaker 2: But, no, we had a bathroom.

424
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,380
Speaker 2: It was a very tiny, awkward bathroom.

425
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,379
Speaker 2: And one day I was taking a shower and I looked up at the ceiling and I noticed this gray stain that hadn't been there.

426
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,103
Speaker 2: Ooh.

427
00:25:30,683 --> 00:25:31,778
Speaker 2: And I ignored it at first.

428
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:32,979
Speaker 0: That's what you do.

429
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,698
Speaker 1: That's what you do.

430
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,200
Speaker 1: You can't imagine that it's actually a serious problem.

431
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:36,284
Speaker 1: No.

432
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,338
Speaker 2: No, and as the days went by, it kept getting bigger and bigger and eventually we were like, "Maybe we should tell the super about

433
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:41,480
Speaker 2: this.".

434
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:41,917
Speaker 2: So we did.

435
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,560
Speaker 2: And our super back then was the kind of guy who would take your complaint, be like, "Okay, cool," and then disappear forever.

436
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:55,580
Speaker 2: Seriously, we have a good super now, but nobody goes to tell them anything because they're so used to being brushed off by the old super.

437
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:58,940
Speaker 1: So I guess at least the old guy was deservedly let go?

438
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:00,079
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was let go.

439
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,539
Speaker 1: That's good.

440
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,840
Speaker 2: And then the other one after him was let go for hitting on a child.

441
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:04,632
Speaker 1: Okay.

442
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:06,878
Speaker 2: Live in a fun place.

443
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,540
Speaker 1: Are these live-in supers who are always in the building?

444
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,580
Speaker 2: Yes, these are live-in supers.

445
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,599
Speaker 1: Ooh, I've never had one of those.

446
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,518
Speaker 0: We got one of those.

447
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:14,059
Speaker 2: Yeah, we don't have a doorman.

448
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,340
Speaker 2: We have a live-in super instead.

449
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,817
Speaker 2: So fancy, yes.

450
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:18,180
Speaker 0: Ah, queens.

451
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,520
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the stain just keeps on getting bigger.

452
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,839
Speaker 2: Nobody does anything about it.

453
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:25,380
Speaker 2: And then little gray specks start to fall down from the ceiling.

454
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,374
Speaker 0: See, that's the moment when things start falling from the ceiling where even I would be like, "Uh,

455
00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:31,455
Speaker 0: hmm.".

456
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:34,440
Speaker 2: No, and I poked him, the super.

457
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,799
Speaker 2: I poked him a few times being like, "Hey, weird stuff is starting to happen in the

458
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,020
Speaker 2: bathroom.".

459
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,440
Speaker 1: Show him a picture or a video or something.

460
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,820
Speaker 2: I didn't have a smartphone back then.

461
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,000
Speaker 1: These were ancient times.

462
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:53,080
Speaker 0: Oh, I think I still have the email I sent to our management organization for my story where I sent them a video I took with our Geek Nights camcorder of water just streaming down our ceiling.

463
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,758
Speaker 2: Oh, thank God it wasn't that bad for me.

464
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,479
Speaker 0: But no, no.

465
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I digress.

466
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:03,580
Speaker 2: Eventually this little gray rain one day finally just turned into a giant chunk of plaster falling right on top of my head while I was in the shower.

467
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:03,826
Speaker 2: Oh, no.

468
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:06,120
Speaker 1: Why did it have to be that?

469
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,879
Speaker 1: It could have fallen down.

470
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:10,700
Speaker 1: You're not in the shower the vast majority of the time.

471
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,856
Speaker 2: Maybe I was making it steamy.

472
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:13,120
Speaker 1: That could have been it.

473
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:13,660
Speaker 2: Made it release.

474
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it should have been like you just walk into the bathroom and you see it there.

475
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:20,660
Speaker 1: The odds of it falling on you at that time is so small.

476
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,340
Speaker 0: Because both situations are unnerving.

477
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:31,815
Speaker 0: Because if you come into your house and there's a bunch of debris on the floor because you don't look up at your ceiling unless you're prompted to, that's already a very unnerving like, "Wait, what

478
00:27:31,856 --> 00:27:32,238
Speaker 0: happened?".

479
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:38,380
Speaker 2: The debris became such a fixture because nobody fixed it for so long that we always had to clean it up before we got in the shower.

480
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,059
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

481
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:41,560
Speaker 0: Was it still like crumbling down?

482
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,379
Speaker 1: What was the cause of it?

483
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:45,279
Speaker 2: I never found out.

484
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,039
Speaker 2: It was probably a faulty pipe.

485
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:47,978
Speaker 2: Okay.

486
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,980
Speaker 2: We are full of faulty pipes in that building.

487
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,554
Speaker 2: Like I said, some of the pipes are still there from the '20s and '30s.

488
00:27:55,262 --> 00:27:57,859
Speaker 2: But yeah, the hole in the ceiling finally got somebody to come fix it.

489
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:00,460
Speaker 2: But that meant no shower for a couple days.

490
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:00,852
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.

491
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,679
Speaker 0: So you decided to like -- so you were taking showers and there's just a hole in the ceiling for a while.

492
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:05,993
Speaker 0: Yep.

493
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,212
Speaker 2: Yep.

494
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,379
Speaker 0: What was in the ceiling?

495
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:10,100
Speaker 0: Did you like go up there and look around?

496
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:12,880
Speaker 2: No, I'm really short and we didn't have a step ladder.

497
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,519
Speaker 0: I would have gone up on a step ladder in a flashlight and been like, "Who is their treasure?

498
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:16,752
Speaker 0: Should I hide something in the

499
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:17,076
Speaker 0: ceiling?".

500
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:23,220
Speaker 2: Well, now that we have a good super, there is a ladder for anyone to borrow in the basement and I guess I'll remember that if there's another hole in my ceiling.

501
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,880
Speaker 1: Old building probably got old treasure.

502
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,316
Speaker 1: Yeah.

503
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,680
Speaker 1: My building doesn't have any treasure in it.

504
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,140
Speaker 2: Oh, man, I just checked out some old corridors in the basement.

505
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:31,780
Speaker 2: That basement is way bigger than I thought.

506
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,149
Speaker 0: Right.

507
00:28:32,741 --> 00:28:34,519
Speaker 0: That is a thing in New York.

508
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:49,137
Speaker 1: I've been in situations where I've been in old buildings in Manhattan and the elevator goes down to B2 and it opens up and it's dark and the scary pipes like it's a movie set and then someone comes in and then it closes.

509
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,660
Speaker 0: So at RIT, there was the steam tunnels that we were allowed to use.

510
00:28:54,063 --> 00:28:56,239
Speaker 0: that connected a bunch of buildings together and they were already pretty deep.

511
00:28:57,023 --> 00:29:01,989
Speaker 0: There was another basement under that that connected a bunch of buildings together that we weren't supposed to go into.

512
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,920
Speaker 0: that I broke into a bunch of times and wandered around.

513
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:04,837
Speaker 0: That was cool.

514
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:16,620
Speaker 0: But I remember under building one in the sub-basement, there was a locked door that went down from there to a sub-sub-basement.

515
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:20,480
Speaker 0: And I always kind of wanted to get in there, but I could never quite jimmy the locks.

516
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
Speaker 0: I never really tried too hard.

517
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:25,840
Speaker 0: I assume the statute of limitations is up on me trespassing at RIT at this point.

518
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:29,618
Speaker 0: But one day the door was unlocked and I was like, "Oh, fuck, I'm going

519
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:29,759
Speaker 0: in!".

520
00:29:30,242 --> 00:29:36,600
Speaker 0: And I went halfway down the stairs, it was pitch black, it smelled weird, and I heard a lot of machine noises and I just bailed.

521
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's all that's down in those places is machines.

522
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,593
Speaker 0: But it sounded big.

523
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's, you know, boilers, furnaces, HVAC, all that kind of shit.

524
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:47,078
Speaker 0: Yup, yup, yup.

525
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:47,620
Speaker 0: Pumps.

526
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,780
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've only seen part of our basement.

527
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,580
Speaker 1: Water filters.

528
00:29:50,841 --> 00:29:56,080
Speaker 2: It's a garbage room, a laundry room, a workshop, and several tiny murder rooms.

529
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:57,920
Speaker 1: Ooh, tiny murder rooms.

530
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,260
Speaker 0: Our building had two illegal bootleg apartments down there for a couple of years.

531
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,879
Speaker 1: I think there's still bootleg apartments on the roof.

532
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:09,760
Speaker 0: I think there still are bootleg apartments on the roof, but the ones in the basement are gone because one of those apartments is now our bike room.

533
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,320
Speaker 0: So I put my bike in this place that still has hookups for a stove.

534
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:25,660
Speaker 0: It's a cool, like, it was obviously an illegal as fuck apartment, but it was kind of a cool space because it has a thing, much like the thing in Peterson 3 in the lounge.

535
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:26,999
Speaker 0: Remember that thing?

536
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:27,480
Speaker 1: Yup.

537
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,105
Speaker 0: It was like that.

538
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,279
Speaker 0: There's a thing like that thing.

539
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,067
Speaker 1: Alright.

540
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:30,840
Speaker 1: Thing.

541
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,032
Speaker 2: We're not allowed on our roof.

542
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:33,839
Speaker 1: I wonder why.

543
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:34,584
Speaker 1: Ooh.

544
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,400
Speaker 1: It's probably not suitable for human, you know, presence.

545
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might have the kind of roof that has, like, a bunch of areas.

546
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,040
Speaker 1: Where someone would just fall off and die.

547
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:44,079
Speaker 0: Or it has the areas you're not supposed to walk on.

548
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:46,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, just fall through because the roof is so shitty.

549
00:30:46,884 --> 00:30:47,989
Speaker 1: Or just covered in equipment.

550
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,100
Speaker 1: It doesn't have any nice areas to stand safely.

551
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:58,680
Speaker 0: Total aside, when I was in high school, the neighbor called my parents once and the police because they thought that I was crazy.

552
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Speaker 1: Because you were on your own roof?

553
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:10,259
Speaker 0: Because I had a headset, telephone, wireless, and at night I would often climb out my bedroom window onto the roof and hang out up there talking to my friends on the phone.

554
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:11,858
Speaker 0: That was the thing I would do.

555
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:22,940
Speaker 0: The neighbor just saw Rim walking back and forth on the roof, gesticulating and ranting into the air every night, and assumed that I was crazy.

556
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:23,779
Speaker 1: That's not a crime.

557
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,460
Speaker 2: Is it like that scene from Signs?

558
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:32,920
Speaker 1: So, my building, which is somewhat modern building.

559
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,420
Speaker 0: Your building's new, like ours.

560
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,317
Speaker 1: If it's pre-war, it's only pre-Iraq war.

561
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, which Iraq war, though?

562
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,797
Speaker 1: The newest one.

563
00:31:41,424 --> 00:31:43,180
Speaker 1: I don't think it's pre-golf war, anyway.

564
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:55,020
Speaker 1: But it's a pretty new building, so I never expected, I basically assumed that nothing bad maintenance-wise would ever happen while I lived there because it's so new and everything is so, even my dishwasher's really good.

565
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,058
Speaker 1: I don't know if they really scrape my dishes and it cleans them, right?

566
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:58,920
Speaker 1: So, what could go wrong in this building?

567
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,740
Speaker 1: Well, I was sleeping in bed and I heard some noises.

568
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:11,580
Speaker 1: It wasn't a consistent tapping noise and it wasn't obviously a dripping noise.

569
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,620
Speaker 1: It was just sort of like the kind of noises you hear in a house.

570
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,140
Speaker 1: You know, like a little creaky, a little tippetappa.

571
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,900
Speaker 0: But you're not in a house, you're in an apartment, which makes it weird.

572
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Speaker 1: And I've never heard noises like that before.

573
00:32:24,302 --> 00:32:25,980
Speaker 1: It's always been completely silent.

574
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,459
Speaker 1: But I'm like, I look around and I don't see anything from my bed.

575
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,458
Speaker 1: So, you know, I ignored it, actually, for like, it must have been at least two days.

576
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:36,700
Speaker 0: That's right.

577
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:45,340
Speaker 0: It seems like the pattern here so far is problem identified, ignored until it causes a bigger problem.

578
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:46,639
Speaker 2: That's the New York way.

579
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:47,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

580
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:55,260
Speaker 0: That hobo's got a knife, but he is two people away from me, so I'm going to continue playing a game on my phone.

581
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:01,360
Speaker 1: But eventually it got to the point where I did hear a consistent tapping that was definitely a drip somewhere.

582
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,839
Speaker 1: And then I look and, you know, I still ignored it then.

583
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:09,380
Speaker 1: It was the next, because I couldn't see anything.

584
00:33:09,985 --> 00:33:10,880
Speaker 1: And then the next morning.

585
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,000
Speaker 0: At least Judith was already like, yo, super.

586
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,588
Speaker 1: Was it that night?

587
00:33:14,608 --> 00:33:15,740
Speaker 1: I think it was that night.

588
00:33:16,282 --> 00:33:23,760
Speaker 1: Anyway, the next time, basically the time after that, I saw in my ceiling, there was clearly a wet spot where I touched it.

589
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:24,720
Speaker 1: It was a splotch.

590
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,220
Speaker 1: And I'm on the third floor and I'm like, where is this water coming from?

591
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:29,239
Speaker 1: I'm in my bedroom.

592
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:37,160
Speaker 1: And the way the building is arranged, all the plumbing is in like one tall stack in the front of the apartments in the middle of the building.

593
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:38,620
Speaker 1: Yeah.

594
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:40,200
Speaker 1: That was the same way.

595
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,060
Speaker 0: Every bathroom in this building is a bathroom above and below it.

596
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,360
Speaker 0: Right.

597
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,339
Speaker 1: That's all the plumbing is in like this, you know, in vertical shafts.

598
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,380
Speaker 0: That's why the ceiling in this room doesn't really have anything.

599
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:48,917
Speaker 0: There's no space.

600
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,880
Speaker 1: Now there is a sprinkler system in my building, but that goes down the middle of the apartments right each way.

601
00:33:56,241 --> 00:34:02,439
Speaker 1: This puddle, the small puddle was like in the middle of my bedroom, nowhere near any kind of water.

602
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:05,140
Speaker 1: I'm like, how the hell is water getting there?

603
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,459
Speaker 1: It makes no sense, but clearly it's happening.

604
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,078
Speaker 1: It's real.

605
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:11,280
Speaker 1: So there's must be some explanation for it, you know?

606
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,440
Speaker 1: So I called supers and then they get plumbers and then things happen.

607
00:34:16,002 --> 00:34:18,320
Speaker 1: And then they still haven't fixed the ceiling.

608
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:21,699
Speaker 1: It's just sort of, I guess they just let it dry out and didn't do anything about it.

609
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,219
Speaker 1: So I guess I'll deal with it.

610
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:34,920
Speaker 1: It's not serious, but apparently everyone living above me has it much more serious problem because there was some sort of valve broken on the sixth floor that had been broken for quite some time.

611
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:41,820
Speaker 1: And the people, I guess, on floors five and four were much worse off than I was on floor three.

612
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:44,300
Speaker 1: Or I don't know if anyone on floor two had a problem.

613
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:54,518
Speaker 0: You know, funnily enough, we had a similar incident in this building unrelated to my bathroom where one day Emily and I just came home and the doorman's like, Whoa, wait, uh, is your apartment okay?

614
00:34:55,742 --> 00:35:01,860
Speaker 0: And we're like, uh, uh, and he's like, yeah, there's this big flood.

615
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:03,209
Speaker 0: We're like, Oh shit.

616
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,980
Speaker 0: And then we go to our apartment and everything's fine as say, at least I four.

617
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:19,626
Speaker 0: So I thought, but then I remember that I'd smelled a weird smell in this very room like a couple days before and I couldn't place the smell and it didn't seem to be getting worse.

618
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:20,735
Speaker 0: I'd just been ignoring it.

619
00:35:22,223 --> 00:35:29,519
Speaker 0: And uh, so I go back down and I'm like, actually there's a weird smell in the inner room and he's like, Oh yeah, it is getting down to you.

620
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:40,880
Speaker 0: So on the 12th floor, a valve for the radiator system had gone in someone's apartment and fucking flooded it like bad, like the whole.

621
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,239
Speaker 1: Why are valves so shitty?

622
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:44,760
Speaker 0: Uh, why indeed?

623
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,519
Speaker 1: Have also have insurance.

624
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,648
Speaker 1: Maybe if insurance is, maybe people complain.

625
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:55,379
Speaker 1: cause like insurance doesn't save you from like tornado or hurricane or flood, but it saves you from incompetence.

626
00:35:55,843 --> 00:36:02,580
Speaker 1: My insurance actually, they told me like they were, they were trying to sell it to me, but I already was buying it, but they were like, these are all the things that covers.

627
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:10,819
Speaker 1: If I start a fire and the sprinkler goes off and the sprinkler sprays someone else's apartment, it'll pay for their shit.

628
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:18,280
Speaker 1: If someone else's starts a fire, like a dumb ass sets my sprinkler off and gets all my shit wet, it'll pay for everything.

629
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,620
Speaker 1: So, and it's like if cheapo cheap insurance, it costs less than like a hundred dollars a year.

630
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,438
Speaker 1: It was like nothing.

631
00:36:23,864 --> 00:36:29,856
Speaker 1: So wherever, even if you're poor, no matter where you live, you should get a renter or homeowner insurance that covers all these sorts of things.

632
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:30,504
Speaker 0: Yeah.

633
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,439
Speaker 0: They'll even cover like your bike if it gets stolen.

634
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:33,247
Speaker 2: Yep.

635
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:33,997
Speaker 2: Even we did that.

636
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:34,968
Speaker 0: Yup.

637
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:35,620
Speaker 0: Pro move.

638
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:48,559
Speaker 0: So inside of that closet, the wall by the outside of the building was just completely wet, but it was radiator water, which has, uh, some sort of anti-freezing like thing in it.

639
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,380
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought it would just be water.

640
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,095
Speaker 0: Was it not radiated?

641
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:53,480
Speaker 0: Modern radiators don't use just water usually.

642
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,560
Speaker 1: They have like a closed circuit of like a special water.

643
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
Speaker 0: Usually they'll have something like that.

644
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,959
Speaker 1: It's not coming from the water supply.

645
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,321
Speaker 0: Yeah.

646
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:04,557
Speaker 0: And it's not like full on antifreeze, but it basically meant that like mold wouldn't grow from this water as long as it was dealt with.

647
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,399
Speaker 0: I guess that's good.

648
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,339
Speaker 0: I basically just had to leave that closet empty for like a week.

649
00:37:09,385 --> 00:37:11,019
Speaker 1: Go get more special water refill it.

650
00:37:11,402 --> 00:37:23,940
Speaker 0: I don't know what they did, but it completely dried out and it was fine, but that's why it was a weird smell because you couldn't get any heat, but apparently the, the six, seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th floors were like bad water damage.

651
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,040
Speaker 0: Got to replace the walls and floors in like this, this room of every apartment.

652
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:30,919
Speaker 0: And above that it was like serious damage.

653
00:37:31,603 --> 00:37:33,700
Speaker 0: So living lower actually really helped us out.

654
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:36,340
Speaker 0: All the other apartments like soaked up all the water.

655
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,600
Speaker 1: I feel like if you're on the top of the top is top floor.

656
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,960
Speaker 1: That's the best case in the penthouse.

657
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:43,180
Speaker 0: You're the one causing everyone else's problem.

658
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,840
Speaker 1: You're safe except from roof problems.

659
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:50,700
Speaker 0: Ah, you know what happens in a lot of buildings, the skylights, cause all the penthouses have skylights.

660
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,618
Speaker 0: They go all the way up to the roof.

661
00:37:52,622 --> 00:37:54,220
Speaker 0: Those leak like a motherfucker apparently.

662
00:37:55,643 --> 00:38:00,980
Speaker 1: But other than that though, the modern buildings are going to have a good roof, right?

663
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,120
Speaker 1: Whereas, you know, you have leaky roofs are in old houses very commonly.

664
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:10,180
Speaker 1: And then you have to replace your roof and it sucks, but we don't have any homeowners on the show to discuss that situation, which is very common.

665
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:14,359
Speaker 1: But I think that's what most people experience water in the ceiling is from leaky roof in a house.

666
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:19,854
Speaker 2: I guess it's nice to know that this can happen in these fancy buildings too and not just in our poor ass 1927 building.

667
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:23,340
Speaker 1: I mean, you go to build a fancy building, right?

668
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:28,940
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, it is a fancy building, but the person who built it wants to build it as cheaply as possible.

669
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:33,079
Speaker 1: They don't actually want to make it, you know, they want to make it look nice to get you to rent it.

670
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,479
Speaker 1: They don't want it to actually be nice.

671
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:38,399
Speaker 1: Having it be nicer only makes it more expensive to make.

672
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,260
Speaker 1: It doesn't let them get any more rent.

673
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:47,200
Speaker 0: That's why like all the fixtures in this building, even though it's a quote unquote luxury building, are the bare goddamn minimum.

674
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:50,460
Speaker 2: They will call anything a luxury building these days.

675
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,479
Speaker 2: I just want to point that out.

676
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,700
Speaker 0: Well, in cities like New York, luxury means the bare minimum to live in.

677
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,080
Speaker 2: It means it's in New York, not New Jersey.

678
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,999
Speaker 1: Luxury means you probably won't see a rat or a cockroach.

679
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:03,260
Speaker 2: That's a lie.

680
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:03,899
Speaker 0: Probably.

681
00:39:04,382 --> 00:39:05,100
Speaker 1: I said probably.

682
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:07,680
Speaker 2: You're going to see a cockroach.

683
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:08,558
Speaker 1: I haven't seen one.

684
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,359
Speaker 1: You're lucky.

685
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,219
Speaker 1: Mine's not luxury.

686
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,073
Speaker 0: We have thankfully never had cockroaches, but we got some carpet beetles.

687
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:14,982
Speaker 0: we've been dealing with that.

688
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:16,640
Speaker 0: I think we finally won the war.

689
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:19,360
Speaker 0: I have not seen a live one in some time.

690
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,180
Speaker 1: The only kind of bug that gets in my apartment is if I open the balcony and a fly comes in, which every single time I open the balcony, a fly comes in.

691
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,160
Speaker 0: He's waiting out there.

692
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:29,759
Speaker 1: I swat him and then another one makes sure thing.

693
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,892
Speaker 0: He comes in, he's like, "I will avenge you,

694
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,315
Speaker 0: Father.".

695
00:39:33,382 --> 00:39:35,520
Speaker 1: Father, it's like, how did you even get born?

696
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,039
Speaker 1: I murdered you, Father.

697
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:42,500
Speaker 0: Dude, did you see there was a story today on like Boeing Boeing and Kotaku and all those places.

698
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,200
Speaker 0: Someone had a sealed fancy DSLR like camera lens.

699
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:52,280
Speaker 0: They sent it for service because a full-grown adult fly was inside of it.

700
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,860
Speaker 1: That's old news.

701
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,059
Speaker 1: That's a super old thing.

702
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:56,399
Speaker 0: I saw it come up in my feed today.

703
00:39:56,821 --> 00:39:59,060
Speaker 1: I saw it a long, long time ago because there's a website.

704
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,359
Speaker 2: Maybe it's happened more than once.

705
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,480
Speaker 1: Maybe, but there's a website, LensRentals, I think is what it's called.

706
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:12,960
Speaker 1: It's a place you can rent camera stuff, but they always post, they have a really good blog where they show repairing lenses and taking them apart and put them together and stuff.

707
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:16,260
Speaker 1: And they showed how like, yeah, here's a lens we got back.

708
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:22,480
Speaker 1: There was a fly stuck in front of the front element, but because of the way lenses work, you basically wouldn't notice.

709
00:40:22,863 --> 00:40:24,058
Speaker 1: But yeah, we had to get it out of there.

710
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,060
Speaker 2: Nah, gross.

711
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're taking the lens on my camera apart right now to replace...

712
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,140
Speaker 1: So it's like, people are worried about a piece of dust on the lens.

713
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,980
Speaker 1: It's like, dude, you got a whole full fly in the lens.

714
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,495
Speaker 1: It won't even show up in your photo.

715
00:40:35,515 --> 00:40:35,960
Speaker 1: You won't notice.

716
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:44,660
Speaker 0: Even my camera with those giant scratches on the inner element of the lens, unless I zoom all the way out and there's a source of light, you couldn't tell.

717
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:47,500
Speaker 1: Right, because the camera is focused on a certain distance.

718
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:54,120
Speaker 1: So if it's focused on five meters away, something that is a centimeter away from the lens is so not in focus, it's invisible.

719
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:59,820
Speaker 0: Yup, and even the scratch on the lens, it just means there's an area with lower quality and/or lens flare.

720
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,199
Speaker 1: You can set your, let's say you got a macro lens and the minimum focus is like a couple inches.

721
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:14,640
Speaker 1: You focus it at a couple inches and you aim it at like, you know, the landscape, you'll see like the blade of grass that's in front and then just like a blurry nothing, right?

722
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:16,140
Speaker 1: If it's not in focus, you can't see it.

723
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,740
Speaker 1: So the fly, even though it was right in the lens, it wasn't in focus.

724
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:22,779
Speaker 0: So we've had water come through the ceiling of our bathroom like five times.

725
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,659
Speaker 1: Whoa, that's a lot of times.

726
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,920
Speaker 0: Well, it happened three times in a row many years ago.

727
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,139
Speaker 1: That only counts as one time.

728
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,960
Speaker 0: Then, like a few years later, it happened once and then it didn't happen for a long time.

729
00:41:35,443 --> 00:41:42,320
Speaker 0: And then very recently it happened real bad and we finally got it fixed completely as far as I can tell.

730
00:41:43,302 --> 00:41:45,100
Speaker 0: But the story was same deal.

731
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:53,080
Speaker 0: I mean, I was laying in the bedroom in bed and I hear a little noise like water dripping and I'm like, I'll ignore that.

732
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,039
Speaker 0: And then Emily is like, uh, you probably left your shower drip and go fix that.

733
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:58,800
Speaker 0: And yeah, you're right.

734
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,680
Speaker 0: And I get up, I go to my bathroom and the floor is just completely wet.

735
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:07,240
Speaker 0: The light fixture is full of water and there's water everywhere.

736
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,720
Speaker 0: The ceiling is like bowing down.

737
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,751
Speaker 1: Why'd you pee on the floor?

738
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:11,460
Speaker 1: You got a bad aim?

739
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,620
Speaker 0: So I'm like, uh, and I go down to the doorman.

740
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,419
Speaker 0: He's like, what?

741
00:42:15,684 --> 00:42:26,459
Speaker 0: And then while I'm waiting for him to like get the stuff together, I went upstairs and I banged on the door of the apartment above us and they did not actually speak English and didn't understand me.

742
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:28,538
Speaker 0: So I couldn't really express.

743
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,319
Speaker 1: What did they speak?

744
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,057
Speaker 0: Korean, I think.

745
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,840
Speaker 1: I don't know the word for water in Korean.

746
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,021
Speaker 0: Yeah.

747
00:42:32,262 --> 00:42:35,280
Speaker 0: So I couldn't really, I wasn't gonna like barge into their apartment.

748
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:38,439
Speaker 0: So the doorman, like they dealt with it and dealt with them.

749
00:42:38,981 --> 00:42:43,699
Speaker 0: But basically what had happened is they had like overflowed their sink.

750
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:45,559
Speaker 2: Well, they just didn't notice.

751
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:51,980
Speaker 0: Every time we've had a problem, it is that family has fucked up in their bathroom.

752
00:42:53,228 --> 00:42:54,460
Speaker 0: There is no pipe problem.

753
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,640
Speaker 0: There is no, the root cause is those people suck at living in an apartment building or suck at using.

754
00:43:00,884 --> 00:43:01,900
Speaker 1: Even the most recent time?

755
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:02,402
Speaker 0: Yeah.

756
00:43:02,545 --> 00:43:03,300
Speaker 0: So same problem.

757
00:43:03,721 --> 00:43:04,980
Speaker 0: I talked to the doorman in the end.

758
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,780
Speaker 0: He was like, yeah, they just had a problem.

759
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:22,320
Speaker 0: They let the, they, they let their toilet overflow because they had clogged it, but it overflowed from the top of the toilet with a continuous stream of clean water because they had messed up the inside of their toilet somehow.

760
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:23,184
Speaker 1: What?

761
00:43:23,507 --> 00:43:24,213
Speaker 2: Do they have kids?

762
00:43:24,273 --> 00:43:25,039
Speaker 2: Is the kids doing it?

763
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:25,867
Speaker 0: I don't know.

764
00:43:25,887 --> 00:43:26,777
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

765
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:28,819
Speaker 0: I think they just suck.

766
00:43:29,101 --> 00:43:31,135
Speaker 1: How do you overflow the top of a toilet?

767
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:31,940
Speaker 1: That's so hard.

768
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,499
Speaker 1: You'd have to like sit there and hold the thing and open.

769
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,800
Speaker 0: I guess if the thing got stuck open somehow.

770
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,380
Speaker 1: No, but the plunger would have to be closed, but you'd have to keep the water flow.

771
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:41,938
Speaker 0: It's hard to do.

772
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,880
Speaker 0: They suck at this apparently.

773
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,840
Speaker 0: And that has been the cause of this problem for so many times.

774
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,740
Speaker 0: So this last time they fixed everything.

775
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:59,260
Speaker 0: But because the door in the bathroom had been damaged by water so many times, after the last time it had warped to the point that the door could not even close anymore.

776
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:01,559
Speaker 0: So they had to replace the door.

777
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,600
Speaker 0: And then I learned that the way they replace doors in this building is they get a big piece of wood and they fucking custom make a door for that exact door.

778
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:09,799
Speaker 1: And they just buy a door?

779
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,396
Speaker 0: They, they, I guess the door is different sizes.

780
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:12,899
Speaker 0: I don't know.

781
00:44:13,261 --> 00:44:16,620
Speaker 0: They made me a custom door, painted it and put it up.

782
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,560
Speaker 2: So that's why your door wasn't closing.

783
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:19,471
Speaker 2: Yeah.

784
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:19,940
Speaker 2: Now I know.

785
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:20,647
Speaker 0: Now you know.

786
00:44:20,748 --> 00:44:21,459
Speaker 0: And now it closes.

787
00:44:22,105 --> 00:44:22,316
Speaker 1: Okay.

788
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,239
Speaker 0: The only good thing to come out of this.

789
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,116
Speaker 1: Well, that's, you see, on the one hand, that's good.

790
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,860
Speaker 1: Everything was fixed, but it's also, if the problem is like, oh, valve exploded.

791
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,060
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, they replaced it.

792
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,820
Speaker 1: They probably check the rest of the valves to make sure they're not faulty.

793
00:44:35,102 --> 00:44:35,384
Speaker 1: Right.

794
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:36,920
Speaker 1: You know, you can have some assurance.

795
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,000
Speaker 1: They're like, okay, not going to have water in the ceiling again for quite a while.

796
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:44,020
Speaker 1: You know, but if it's people fucking up, it's like, all right, got all new door.

797
00:44:44,202 --> 00:44:45,659
Speaker 1: And then the next day they fuck up again.

798
00:44:45,964 --> 00:44:46,219
Speaker 0: Yup.

799
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:52,320
Speaker 0: The thing is, I assume either the building will evict them or make them pay for the damage.

800
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,379
Speaker 1: You can make them pay.

801
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,160
Speaker 1: I don't know if you can evict someone for just being dumb.

802
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:56,680
Speaker 2: It's not easy to evict people here.

803
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:56,950
Speaker 0: Yeah.

804
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:59,120
Speaker 0: You can eventually, but it takes a long time.

805
00:44:59,302 --> 00:44:59,738
Speaker 1: Not for that.

806
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,280
Speaker 1: That seems like a very weak thing to evict someone for.

807
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,940
Speaker 1: You got to have, like, didn't pay rent ever to evict someone in the city.

808
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,379
Speaker 2: Yeah, they can still get away with it.

809
00:45:07,702 --> 00:45:08,460
Speaker 2: Not paying for months.

810
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,840
Speaker 1: If they tried to make them pay.

811
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:10,557
Speaker 1: Save some money.

812
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:15,719
Speaker 0: And they refuse to pay for the damage, I'll bet they could eventually, after like four years, evict them.

813
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,537
Speaker 1: I mean, whoever was across from you had some sort of paper on their door.

814
00:45:19,557 --> 00:45:21,099
Speaker 1: that was some sort of eviction.

815
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:22,160
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

816
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:29,079
Speaker 0: The apartment across from us, my best guess, because it was like police stuff going on.

817
00:45:29,482 --> 00:45:30,520
Speaker 1: Or court stuff, at least.

818
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,640
Speaker 0: There was court and police stuff and a search warrant happened.

819
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,919
Speaker 0: Like, I found a bunch of nonsense.

820
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:48,138
Speaker 0: Pretty sure whoever lived in that apartment left because they were trying to avoid being served a warrant and then got evicted because they weren't paying rent in the time before they left.

821
00:45:48,461 --> 00:45:56,940
Speaker 0: So they abandoned the apartment and eventually, like a judge ordered the apartment to be taken over by the police to get you invested, like evidence gathering.

822
00:45:57,461 --> 00:46:00,320
Speaker 0: They left the door unlocked for like a month while they were doing this.

823
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,859
Speaker 0: I went in there to see what was going on and everything was just like removed at that point.

824
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,479
Speaker 1: Tampered to all the evidence.

825
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,620
Speaker 2: That sounds like how we got our current apartment.

826
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:13,859
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were looking to move out of the bottom floor one because, you know, there was water in the ceiling and it was tiny and it sucked.

827
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:20,480
Speaker 2: And we were looking at one on the fourth floor and we got shown it and they said that they would give us priority because we already lived there.

828
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,159
Speaker 2: But then they didn't.

829
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:21,690
Speaker 2: They sold it.

830
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:29,439
Speaker 2: But then they contacted us being like, oh, there's another one on the same floor available because the guy who used to live there just disappeared.

831
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,720
Speaker 0: Oh, his furniture is still in there.

832
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,879
Speaker 1: You can take whatever you want.

833
00:46:34,664 --> 00:46:35,519
Speaker 1: I'll take it to the dump.

834
00:46:35,903 --> 00:46:36,376
Speaker 2: I'll take it.

835
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,800
Speaker 2: Well, we kept the hutch, but I'm pretty sure that bed was haunted.

836
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,179
Speaker 1: Maybe that's what happened to him.

837
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,080
Speaker 1: Maybe he's in the bed.

838
00:46:44,681 --> 00:46:51,180
Speaker 0: I love how neighbor just fucking disappeared is also a relatively common story in New York.

839
00:46:51,882 --> 00:46:55,820
Speaker 1: But yeah, I'm sure it's shocking how many people have water in the ceiling.

840
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:05,351
Speaker 1: And I think the lesson to be learned here is if I hear even the slightest, vaguest drip or noise in any wall, I am now of the mode.

841
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:09,600
Speaker 1: There is water in the ceiling.

842
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:15,160
Speaker 1: Get this fixed before there's any sort of droops or bulges or anything and never ignore bad smells.

843
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:15,915
Speaker 1: No, no.

844
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,080
Speaker 0: If there is a bad smell, you find the source of it, though.

845
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:25,480
Speaker 0: I remember one time we were sitting in the apartment and we smelled of garbage smell.

846
00:47:26,265 --> 00:47:26,711
Speaker 0: And it was bad.

847
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:28,200
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, shit.

848
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:32,340
Speaker 0: And we like not take out of garbage that we should have taken out the night before.

849
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:34,220
Speaker 0: But no, there was a clean bag in the garbage.

850
00:47:34,642 --> 00:47:37,839
Speaker 0: And I started hunting around the apartment like, where's the smell coming from?

851
00:47:38,262 --> 00:47:40,900
Speaker 0: And I got to the balcony and it's coming from outside.

852
00:47:42,342 --> 00:47:44,640
Speaker 0: That was three summers, three or four summers ago.

853
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,519
Speaker 0: And the Hudson River was pretty low and the East River is pretty low.

854
00:47:48,383 --> 00:47:50,980
Speaker 0: And the garbage layer had been exposed in the river.

855
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:52,880
Speaker 0: The whole neighborhood smelled like garbage.

856
00:47:53,964 --> 00:47:54,960
Speaker 0: It was not our apartment.

857
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,440
Speaker 2: Classic New York summer.

858
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:56,929
Speaker 2: Yep.

859
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:00,100
Speaker 0: I think we were done here.

860
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:00,878
Speaker 0: Let's go get some food.

861
00:48:07,123 --> 00:48:09,240
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

871
00:49:28,797 --> 00:49:29,279
Speaker 0: Meet Mr.

872
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,929
Speaker 0: Archimedes of Ancient Greece.

873
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:34,957
Speaker 0: Long ago Archis said, "Give me a lever.

874
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:39,608
Speaker 0: Long enough and I can move the

875
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:40,169
Speaker 0: world.".

876
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:44,870
Speaker 0: What Archimedes meant was that the power of a lever is practically unlimited.
