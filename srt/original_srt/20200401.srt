1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,589
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday April 1st 2020.

2
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,970
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,416
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:17,492
Speaker 0: We're talking about the manga gambling apocalypse.

5
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:21,482
Speaker 1: Kaiji Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:28,892
Speaker 1: I was very happy that this year that the Internet.

7
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:37,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, the internet sucks day was mostly canceled and in the places where it was not canceled It was a decent mostly decent.

8
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:53,583
Speaker 1: The only the only fool like attempting to deceive people that I saw today that worked not on me, but on other people is someone posted like NHL salary cap is gonna likely be 74 million or whatever.

9
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:53,965
Speaker 1: it was like.

10
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:59,310
Speaker 1: it was like a low number Right and everyone's like oh no my tea every team is ruined.

11
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:03,328
Speaker 1: No, right because it's based on like, you know revenues or something, right?

12
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:03,810
Speaker 1: It's gonna be.

13
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:13,109
Speaker 1: But what they did is they took a tweet from like 2014 And they posted it and it's like hoping people wouldn't look at the date.

14
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:23,542
Speaker 1: So it was a tweet from a legit sports journalist saying this right That's well done not on April 1st, not in 2020.

15
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:27,460
Speaker 0: I Feel like it is posted.

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,817
Speaker 1: It's like read it as if it was new And some people didn't look at it.

17
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,010
Speaker 0: and we're like, oh the strategic ancient retweet will be mine.

18
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:42,070
Speaker 1: This is the thing that you like, you know made sense to be and you know, like you sort of knew was coming, right?

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,736
Speaker 1: It was extremely clever.

20
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:50,476
Speaker 0: We actually did a good one on geek nights once a long time ago Did we?

21
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,905
Speaker 0: we did a moderately elaborate one.

22
00:01:51,945 --> 00:02:17,150
Speaker 0: what we did is We recorded and we recorded the show and then we recorded a bunch of extra dialogue Like first I record I made all this recording of like noise happening like far away from the microphone and we recorded a bit where you and I were talking about three or four specific forum users in the old geek nights forum and Acting as though we run those accounts and planning what flame war we were gonna start that weekend

23
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:18,238
Speaker 1: And

24
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:19,030
Speaker 0: I had that place.

25
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,034
Speaker 0: So the odd like.

26
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:36,459
Speaker 0: basically it sounds like we forgot to stop the record button and our outro music plays but you hear us like talking to each other in the background like Okay shows done whatever and then there's silence and noise for a while and then like five or six minutes later We've walk quote walk back into the room and start talking about.

27
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,225
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna post his Killarney tonight.

28
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:39,770
Speaker 0: start a real fucking flame war.

29
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:40,264
Speaker 0: Let's go.

30
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,179
Speaker 0: Okay, I was the only good one we ever did.

31
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,289
Speaker 1: we got some people if you think that's good.

32
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:46,534
Speaker 0: Okay I think that's pretty funny.

33
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:49,750
Speaker 0: We fooled people and we did not just lie to them.

34
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:55,149
Speaker 0: We just we put something out there and people believed it and it was moderately low-key funny and then it ended.

35
00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:57,665
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it didn't cause too much harm.

36
00:02:57,926 --> 00:03:04,432
Speaker 0: now That's really Killarney's gone, but that's probably for the best Hmm.

37
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,779
Speaker 0: Wonder what that dude's still alive.

38
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,065
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

39
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a lot.

40
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,649
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people who listen to geek nights a long time ago.

41
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:14,326
Speaker 1: You know came in and out of the community and you know, you don't track.

42
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:15,330
Speaker 1: It's just some internet name.

43
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,816
Speaker 1: How many names are there on the internet?

44
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:18,283
Speaker 1: I don't hate people.

45
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:18,825
Speaker 1: It happens.

46
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:19,970
Speaker 0: Everybody was gaga.

47
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,344
Speaker 0: All right, all right, so there is actually big anime news like anime news.

48
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:27,330
Speaker 1: that's April not April Fool's.

49
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:35,293
Speaker 0: It's so big that when I saw the headline, I assumed it was an April Fool's joke, and now I'm just sad Right.

50
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:43,776
Speaker 1: So the past few Wednesday episodes of geek nights only animes we've talked about are ones from science are ooh and Masaaki wasa because

51
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:47,426
Speaker 0: their outputs been crazy and they're in a thousand because

52
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:57,418
Speaker 1: basically ever since Yuasa and do what's-her-name Choi and young started the science our studio back in the day They did their Adventure Time episode.

53
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,385
Speaker 1: They did a bunch of movies, right?

54
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,564
Speaker 1: By the way What's it called?

55
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,535
Speaker 1: Lou over the wall.

56
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,765
Speaker 1: That's right is on Netflix right now.

57
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:11,801
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, yeah If it anyway if it is the vampire dog one anyway.

58
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:24,755
Speaker 1: Um Ever since they started their output has been insane and among the best anime there is both in TV and Cinema, right?

59
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:27,970
Speaker 1: So and a lot of their stuff has just been coming out lately.

60
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,699
Speaker 1: Rapid-fire right.

61
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:45,989
Speaker 1: not because they did that much at once But because I guess sort of like the timing the way things worked out is like, you know They're new Isaac and TV series out now a movie They did ride your wave last year and but it came to the theaters recently, right?

62
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,830
Speaker 1: So it's like all their stuff is hitting it once but the news is that you wasa is retiring as president.

63
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,083
Speaker 1: So I guess he's not like gonna stay at these that he's like leaving the company.

64
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,810
Speaker 1: He's not like moving down to another position.

65
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:01,733
Speaker 0: Yep, it's more.

66
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:02,475
Speaker 0: It's almost like a rock.

67
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:03,779
Speaker 0: It's a robert ku situation.

68
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:07,651
Speaker 1: It's like he worked too hard and now he's like, alright I'm out.

69
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:08,214
Speaker 1: Peace.

70
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:11,165
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go take a rest and maybe work.

71
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,314
Speaker 1: He's not leaving the industry Right.

72
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:17,150
Speaker 1: Yes, just leaving the company and he'll do something else later.

73
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:24,370
Speaker 0: So on one hand I'm worried because he definitely in at least in some of their works did the like Ghibli style.

74
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:30,410
Speaker 0: I'm gonna like make all the storyboards myself by hand and I'm gonna do a hundred percent creative control of these bits.

75
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:43,400
Speaker 0: But on the other hand he and the studio built a really good Pipeline to elevate people and give that like raise them up in the anime industry in a very old-school manner Right, and it's like no one else is leaving right?

76
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:54,238
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, so on the one hand it's like yeah they're most important creator who got all the credit directed all the big works and Drew all the storyboards by themselves is leaving.

77
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,665
Speaker 1: So there's some question as to what.

78
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:59,990
Speaker 1: they're not closing the studio So they're still working on stuff, right?

79
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,541
Speaker 1: The question is what can the remaining people produce without him?

80
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:06,730
Speaker 1: is creative input, right if he's doing if he's elsewhere?

81
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:14,390
Speaker 0: But one thing that could happen but this powerhouse studio We gotta watch is who are the key animators who have been doing a lot more key?

82
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,745
Speaker 0: Animation that are now gonna get there like early assistant director role.

83
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:18,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, who knows?

84
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:26,320
Speaker 1: You know, it's like on the one hand it could be a situation where what's the studio of the people who left Ghibli.

85
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,233
Speaker 0: Oh When they made witches flower, yeah, and it's kind of meh.

86
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:32,618
Speaker 1: Yeah, right air says Ghibli.

87
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:35,446
Speaker 1: so like is science.

88
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:35,726
Speaker 1: are?

89
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:44,049
Speaker 1: we're gonna now degrade and become a lot like a you know, a Bad version of its of its former self, right?

90
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:50,979
Speaker 1: or if they can maintain which I believe that they actually could You know just someone else drawing the storyboards, right?

91
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:56,040
Speaker 1: Then this could actually be viewed as a good thing because you also is not leaving the industry, right?

92
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:07,659
Speaker 1: so it's like if you're an artist right and you can make you're like a fountain that art comes out of right and You could go and just keep making your art on your own.

93
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:20,675
Speaker 1: But if you set other people up and make them artists and so that their fountains spit out all sorts of wonderful art You know by helping them out forming a studio, right and then you leave.

94
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:22,120
Speaker 1: Well, you're still a fountain of art.

95
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:25,860
Speaker 1: It's not like you suck now as long as he works on something somewhere.

96
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,703
Speaker 0: But also if you've created a structure that is conducive to creative people making good creative works Like if you built up.

97
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:34,230
Speaker 0: if you it's like if you're prime a pump.

98
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:41,720
Speaker 0: if you prime the pump and it starts pumping and you walk Away, it'll just keep pumping if you didn't and then you can go pump and then you can go pump another pump.

99
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,040
Speaker 1: They can't pump itself, right?

100
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:58,229
Speaker 1: So this could be a positive in which case where science sorrow will continue to do great and then he'll go do great somewhere else hopefully less vigorously And You know more more restfully, right?

101
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:03,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, we'll see how either one Goes and the future.

102
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:07,240
Speaker 1: and we still have you know, there's still plenty of works from them.

103
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,393
Speaker 1: Most of you probably haven't seen so yep.

104
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:15,082
Speaker 0: So speaking of keep your hands off a second Emily and I did watch it all the way to the end because it's only 12 Episodes.

105
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:16,728
Speaker 0: like it's a pretty short show.

106
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,780
Speaker 0: So we watched it to the end and the geek bite.

107
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:23,050
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna give a full like spoiler your final thoughts But spoilers.

108
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:23,919
Speaker 0: they make more anime.

109
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:37,464
Speaker 0: But the show not only continues to be good But it doubles down on all of its themes and also really gets into the characters backstories in a written nice Nuanced way.

110
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:46,880
Speaker 0: like the ending is just so satisfying and the end is basically they make a big animation and I'm not gonna spoil Like the things that happen as they make the animation.

111
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,602
Speaker 0: It's all great.

112
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:54,560
Speaker 0: a certain character solves a DVD distribution problem with a threat with threatening people with an angle grinder at one point.

113
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:59,823
Speaker 0: but The end is basically they make a longer form Animation.

114
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:09,839
Speaker 0: that's really heartfelt and really sad and it kind of blows up the world Mm-hmm, or at least it blows up the entire town in the metaphorical way of the show.

115
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:11,765
Speaker 0: Yep, like it changed it.

116
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:18,297
Speaker 0: It's very clear that the end was that that anime they made changed the entire town Even if they can't see it yet.

117
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:21,540
Speaker 0: So the show is a hundred percent worth watching to the end.

118
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,748
Speaker 0: It just gets better and better as it goes on.

119
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:26,357
Speaker 0: a plus beginning to end no breaks.

120
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,430
Speaker 1: All right Well, I finished watching that Castlevania season 3.

121
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,053
Speaker 1: Oh, I gotta get on that.

122
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:33,709
Speaker 1: So cuz I had only watched half of it.

123
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,300
Speaker 1: I think last time we had a Wednesday show, right?

124
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:47,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then basically I you know that has these four plot lines going on with these four different sets of characters and four different places Even though some of them are on the move and some of them are sitting still.

125
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,180
Speaker 1: so I like snatch style.

126
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:55,108
Speaker 1: So what I thought was gonna happen is that like snatch all the characters are gonna physically Meet in one place via some means right.

127
00:09:55,228 --> 00:10:03,977
Speaker 1: at least one of the plot lines had characters that were on the move via boat and walking right And some other ones might have had teleportation with magic.

128
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:04,359
Speaker 1: Who knows?

129
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:15,846
Speaker 1: But actually what happened was they didn't meet but instead they all had Climaxes in their individual plots Simultaneously in the timeline.

130
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:24,359
Speaker 1: So it's like at this exact point in time in the universe of the of Castlevania two of the storylines had met major sex scenes.

131
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:31,060
Speaker 1: Two of them had major war scenes at the same time and the end of the show is cutting between the two.

132
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:32,286
Speaker 1: It's like war sex.

133
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,096
Speaker 1: war sex back to war one.

134
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,768
Speaker 1: sex to War number two.

135
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:37,554
Speaker 1: sex number two.

136
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:38,380
Speaker 1: back to the beginning.

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,419
Speaker 1: Invested in this now, so that's what happens at the end of you know.

138
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,490
Speaker 1: Yes, three on Netflix.

139
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:50,360
Speaker 1: if you're into that you can go for it.

140
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,971
Speaker 0: I mean, I am deeply into that and I feel like I'm just.

141
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:53,795
Speaker 0: that's gonna be the next.

142
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:54,960
Speaker 1: it's obviously not safe.

143
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:55,896

00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,790
Speaker 0: That was the first anime I ever saw cuz she made me watch it.

150
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:12,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, my mom loves harsh.

151
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:21,377
Speaker 0: Yeah So, uh in some other news, it looks like Viz is licensing the Super Mario Brothers manga mania.

152
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:27,823
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if people know about this manga, but way way way back in the day Like way back.

153
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:31,053
Speaker 1: I was a book off which is where you buy the cheap used.

154
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:34,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're talking like early 90s Right, right, right.

155
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:37,913
Speaker 1: and I was in the book off looking for something to buy that was cheap.

156
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:41,296
Speaker 1: that maybe would be readable almost.

157
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:44,440
Speaker 1: So there was a Mario manga that was for kids.

158
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,654
Speaker 1: It was like Super Mario and I'm like and it was really cute.

159
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,967
Speaker 1: and I was like, oh well That's at least if I if I ever learned Japanese spoilers I didn't.

160
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:59,640
Speaker 1: I Could read that because it's for children and if not, I could at least understand what's going on because it's Mario.

161
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,149
Speaker 1: I know the characters and the pictures are cute.

162
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,380
Speaker 1: So and that's never good probably be published in the u.s.

163
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:10,445
Speaker 1: So I've had the volume one of that manga for a super long time And what do you know?

164
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:12,011
Speaker 1: this is bringing it over.

165
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:24,360
Speaker 0: if you don't this manga is actually been running Yeah since 1991 and Cora Cora comics is when it started and from anime news networking is the Shigaka kon published the 55th volume of it this year in January.

166
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:25,966
Speaker 1: Yep, it's still.

167
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:29,860
Speaker 1: it's just a Mario comic for kids that's been going for like ever.

168
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:33,736
Speaker 1: It's like if you're an elementary school kid and you're like Mario in Japan.

169
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:34,599
Speaker 1: You are well fed.

170
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,240
Speaker 0: It's just see it like the impression.

171
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:45,092
Speaker 0: I've read a bunch of Scandalations of like bits of it before and it's just cute and funny and like all the characters are great like peach is just hilarious Mario's grade.

172
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:45,335
Speaker 0: and yeah,

173
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:54,535
Speaker 1: yeah I'll probably I'm probably just gonna buy volume one in English to put it next to the Japanese volume one in English to be like Haha, and you know look at them together and you know, so apparently

174
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:59,612
Speaker 0: this is a compilation of Hand-picked stories from the Mario.

175
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,476
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not just.

176
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:01,500
Speaker 0: it's not just volume one.

177
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:08,102
Speaker 0: it looks like it's a hand-picked collection of the ones that were the funniest or the most popular or Cetera.

178
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:10,100
Speaker 1: Well, that's still worth that's still worth buying.

179
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:18,780
Speaker 1: But I think if you look at the actual volume one I have I think it's almost sort of like an origin story in many Ways a little bit not not completely, right?

180
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:22,200
Speaker 1: But it's sort of like I think they Yoshi hatches from an egg at one point.

181
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, so you guess you're gonna miss out on that unless they choose that.

182
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:27,480
Speaker 0: they might choose that.

183
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,860
Speaker 1: Maybe who knows they got how many years of stuff to choose?

184
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:35,920
Speaker 1: So me your Mario and they I guess because you assume anyone reading it knows Mario.

185
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,596
Speaker 1: You don't need to have any of that, you know continued continuity.

186
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:41,740
Speaker 1: You could just pick random stuff.

187
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,442
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't.

188
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:46,676
Speaker 0: you don't need to know the lore of the Super Mario verse to enjoy.

189
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:48,542
Speaker 1: if you buy this, you know Right.

190
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:53,640
Speaker 0: All you need to know is Mario's the red guy Luigi's the green guy and poop is the bad guy.

191
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,327
Speaker 1: Yep, Daisy's the princess.

192
00:13:55,548 --> 00:14:05,427
Speaker 0: Yeah peaches the Francis and mushrooms are complicated But anyway things of the day.

193
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:12,808
Speaker 0: so speaking of anime and animation a lot of shows are gonna be on hiatus because the studios Can't necessarily have all their workers coming in.

194
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:22,072
Speaker 0: a lot of stuff is just delayed like across the board all over the world but adult swim just release like couple days ago.

195
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:25,932
Speaker 0: a Long short like this is almost six minutes long.

196
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:31,460
Speaker 0: It's a really it's Rick and Morty But it's basically Rick and Morty as lone wolf and cub.

197
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:33,830
Speaker 0: It's obviously done in like a what?

198
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,101
Speaker 0: It's a 3d CG kind of thing Like.

199
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:42,691
Speaker 0: it's not the level of animation of the show, but it's really well made Actually really good.

200
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:51,100
Speaker 0: Like I enjoyed this Quite a bit and I kind of combination is that it's basically just Rick is the lone wolf and Morty is the cub.

201
00:14:52,262 --> 00:14:56,620
Speaker 1: Who out there besides like you knows both Rick and Morty and lone wolf and cub?

202
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,911
Speaker 0: I honestly think would argue that the majority of Rick and Morty fans who are not the shitty ones who hate the show now Do in fact know about both.

203
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:05,898
Speaker 0: the overlap is heavy.

204
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:09,020
Speaker 0: Aha, I love their shit out of Rick and Morty.

205
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:12,080
Speaker 0: I think it's a pretty great show and I've still to this day.

206
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:23,160
Speaker 0: I give props to the creators for recognizing that they had a toxic fan base and Specifically targeting the two seasons they made after that to drive that part of the fan base away.

207
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:29,238
Speaker 0: Mmm, like they made Rick the enemy they made him the shitty villain because you're not it's it's.

208
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:32,560
Speaker 0: you know It's kind of like what happened to Rick and Morty was kind of like what happened with Breaking Bad.

209
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,770
Speaker 0: Shitty people watch Breaking Bad and said Wow Walter.

210
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,055
Speaker 0: I want to be like him.

211
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:43,260
Speaker 0: He's the hero and Normal people watch it like wow, this is the story of a man becoming a complete piece of shit.

212
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,887
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's just a problem in all me.

213
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:58,035
Speaker 1: on all fictional media where whichever character is the main character Yeah, even kind of with them right whether they're bad or good and you can see that in Death Note Godfather, you know, whatever Right.

214
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:11,274
Speaker 1: It's like, you know they just because the person gets all the screen time and you you you get you feel closer to that person and Sympathize empathize with them regardless of whether they're good or bad or you're supposed to or not.

215
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:17,760
Speaker 1: And so I just generally You know, not that I create that much fiction, right?

216
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:22,978
Speaker 1: But if I did I would shy away from ever making the main character the bad character.

217
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:25,278
Speaker 0: No Unless it's about them.

218
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:28,527
Speaker 1: Basically, I'm saying you know, what should ever do that?

219
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,178
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, you know, it's it's a dangerous place to tread.

220
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,619
Speaker 0: Yep But like a house of cards did that like it gets her really on.

221
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:45,160
Speaker 0: you know The main guy's side Kevin Spacey for a while and then it there's a point where the show is just like you realize I'm the bad guy, right Right.

222
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:50,900
Speaker 0: I am the enemy and it actually handles that reasonably well until the show went off the rails and got stupid.

223
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:59,680
Speaker 0: but I can't actually blame the people who made that show because the show is based on house of cards is actually based on a BBC show from a long time ago about Parliament.

224
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:09,622
Speaker 0: They had to adapt it to American politics and the BBC show was apparently also Critically acclaimed and fantastic for a little while and then went off the rails and got stupid Uh-huh.

225
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:10,707
Speaker 0: So they went off there.

226
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,780
Speaker 0: They went off a different set of rails and also got stupid.

227
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,244
Speaker 1: Okay, somebody got.

228
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:22,061
Speaker 1: so my thing of the day we just talked about, you know, I see a good house a Good house.

229
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:25,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, we thought about science are overworking and such right?

230
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,790
Speaker 1: So you want to talk about overworking.

231
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:38,077
Speaker 1: you go back to the Tezuka days in 1963. here is a video of the studio They're making the actual Astro Boy in the 60s.

232
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:47,739
Speaker 1: I can see them drawing You know frames and cells that I have an episode that I have seen of the original Astro Boy.

233
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,436
Speaker 1: Yes, someone went in there and filmed them making the show.

234
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:57,920
Speaker 1: it's pretty crazy What's going on inside that animation studio when they didn't have computers or anything.

235
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:10,490
Speaker 1: And they're churning out, you know, crazy amounts of Astro Boy by hand, you know low quality high quantity I mean, it's all Japanese.

236
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,535
Speaker 1: I can't tell what they're saying.

237
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:12,660
Speaker 1: So it doesn't have subtitles.

238
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:19,224
Speaker 1: Maybe someone else can tell but you don't need it because the video footage alone is Pretty unbeatable.

239
00:18:19,404 --> 00:18:22,614
Speaker 0: definitely a bootleg account because it has 48 subscribers.

240
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:28,110
Speaker 0: The logo just says guy next Yep, and this video has like less than a thousand views.

241
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:29,435
Speaker 1: Yeah, who cares?

242
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:29,937
Speaker 0: Yep.

243
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:30,860
Speaker 0: This is super cool.

244
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,651
Speaker 0: I hope it stays up long enough for you guys to watch it.

245
00:18:33,254 --> 00:18:37,160
Speaker 0: Yeah in the meta moment I didn't read Genji because I read Kaiji.

246
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:41,891
Speaker 0: As you know, we're not doing any conventions for the foreseeable future.

247
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,516
Speaker 0: We're recording the show remotely.

248
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:44,520
Speaker 0: So it'll sound a little weird.

249
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,640
Speaker 0: We're still tweaking the pipeline.

250
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:48,800
Speaker 0: Hopefully we can start live-streaming the show on YouTube again.

251
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:59,420
Speaker 0: I'm doing a test of a pipeline for that today And if that test works starting next week, you'll be able to watch the live stream again Which I know more of you look forward to than I expected.

252
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:06,904
Speaker 1: hmm The only other meta thing is that we do have a geek nights Discord.

253
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:19,470
Speaker 1: if you come to the geek nights forum where you should come Community dot front recruit calm or our you contact us via anyway You know, you could find the link.

254
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,840
Speaker 0: someone will give you the link or you'll find it in the forum.

255
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:23,989
Speaker 0: We'll put that one tiny barrier.

256
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:43,547
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll tweet it just now or something It's like, you know, but yeah, you can get into the geek night semi mostly official discord server And in that server there's a lot of streaming going on both by us and by other listeners because it's way easier to stream on discord to a Handful of people in a voice chat.

257
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:46,140
Speaker 1: if I go on twitch only a handful of people are gonna watch anyway.

258
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,714
Speaker 1: So why should I go through all the hassle of setting up twitch?

259
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:51,040
Speaker 1: I'll just go to discord and do it.

260
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:56,160
Speaker 1: You know, we'll still do some streamings on twitches and youtubes.

261
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,000
Speaker 1: You know for things that should be publicly broadcasted and are worth the hassle.

262
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,324
Speaker 1: But no if I'm just playing a video game at night, it's like why should I said I'm not a pro streamer No one not right.

263
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:08,288
Speaker 1: So why should I hassle?

264
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:15,680
Speaker 1: Yeah instead of twitch, but then discord is so easy Why not stream on discord to a couple listeners who happen to care?

265
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to watch me just like playing a random Civ game for a little while Like I and it's and it's voice chat.

266
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:23,437
Speaker 1: So you're voice chatting with whoever is doing the streaming.

267
00:20:23,477 --> 00:20:24,220
Speaker 1: So that's that's fun.

268
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:33,104
Speaker 0: Yeah and Also up since we're stuck alone in the quarantine Emily and I are gonna start rapidly producing more of our Disney theatrical animation.

00:20:58,728 --> 00:21:01,700
Speaker 0: it was either the first or one of the very first.

282
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:08,639
Speaker 0: But it might actually be the first movie ever to record with multi-track audio.

283
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:10,171
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that.

284
00:21:10,695 --> 00:21:11,219
Speaker 0: Did you know that?

285
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,584
Speaker 0: Fantasize know that?

286
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,608
Speaker 0: how many tracks did they use?

287
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:16,159
Speaker 1: I don't know how many because it wasn't stereo.

288
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:20,238
Speaker 1: I just I just remember because I watched those like a Fantasia documentary.

289
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:27,079
Speaker 1: I watch I Think when Fantasia got re-released on VHS is when we bought it.

290
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:35,187
Speaker 1: Right, it was like, you know, it came out of the vault for a short time in the 90s I think and around that time.

291
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:39,320
Speaker 1: I don't know if was a TV special or maybe just an advertisement for Fantasia.

292
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:51,267
Speaker 1: But it basically, you know, there was some thing I watched that was like You know hyping up Fantasia and gave all sorts of background infos and to sound like that was Ridiculously groundbreaking.

293
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:51,850
Speaker 0: for what cuz?

294
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,687
Speaker 0: for one it was optical audio recording Before that was really a thing anywhere else.

295
00:21:56,747 --> 00:21:59,795
Speaker 0: Like it was a pretty novel method of recording audio.

296
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:01,680
Speaker 0: They recorded nine tracks simultaneously.

297
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:08,539
Speaker 0: Geek nights did not have the capability to record nine tracks simultaneously until like five years ago.

298
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:15,808
Speaker 1: I mean, you know you think about all those movies that had original, you know synth, you know orchestral scores right.

299
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:25,422
Speaker 1: and then you know, like you watch Star Wars right and Star Wars they hire a symphony and they play Star Wars and then they go home and they take the recording and they attach it To the Star Wars.

300
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:30,860
Speaker 0: and the recording has a million different tracks because there's a bunch of mother's like a microphone on every horn.

301
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,889
Speaker 0: There's like a microphone for each section.

302
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:35,520
Speaker 0: There's a faraway microphone and a further away microphone.

303
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:38,072
Speaker 1: But the point is is that Fantasia is.

304
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:39,580
Speaker 1: what if that?

305
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,252
Speaker 1: Recording session right?

306
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:43,238
Speaker 1: was the movie?

307
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:48,799
Speaker 0: That's a Fantasia is except they Recorded it with a click track.

308
00:22:49,341 --> 00:22:55,625
Speaker 0: That was the ninth track and then the animators used the click track to make sure they could time the animation so it would fit with the music Mm-hmm.

309
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:00,600
Speaker 0: It was shocking technology technological advancement for that era.

310
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:09,279
Speaker 0: So let's get right into it, uh, we know I mean everyone knows about gambler kygee like even does everyone know about it?

311
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,357
Speaker 0: I mean, I feel like people who listen to geek nights at least know of that angle looking guy.

312
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:15,160
Speaker 0: Who's a gambler?

313
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,879
Speaker 1: So there's a the creator of this manga, right?

314
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,249
Speaker 1: Nobuyuki Fukumoto, right?

315
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:30,785
Speaker 1: So this person also created The other the mahjong thing, which is yeah G aka key.

316
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:32,530
Speaker 0: That's what yep aka key which looks right.

317
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,998
Speaker 0: so they have seen nerds confuse the two.

318
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:36,442
Speaker 0: cuz You did.

319
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:42,298
Speaker 0: the genre is angle looking dude who gambles in ridiculous games, that's it.

320
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:45,158
Speaker 1: that's the genre right, so basically there was.

321
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:49,519
Speaker 1: Akagi was the first one that I saw I think when the anime came out.

322
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:56,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, we reviewed it on geek nights and it had this unique visual style to it and it was about gambling and sort of like.

323
00:23:56,421 --> 00:24:00,280
Speaker 1: You know not the way Hikaru no go is about go where it's sort of real.

324
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:05,540
Speaker 0: Oh my god, we reviewed Akagi and Gundam f91 in the same episode.

325
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:06,920
Speaker 1: Okay, what year was that?

326
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:29,336
Speaker 1: 2006. so in 2006 Akagi came out and I found out about this person because their art style was so distinctive and they were doing anime manga about gambling in sort of ridiculous shonen ways Right and it really stood out is kind of unique and it became a thing and some people are really into that thing and some People aren't right, but yeah this creator, right?

327
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:40,548
Speaker 1: No, buki Fukumoto makes basically tons and tons of stuff all in this very specific realm of Absolutely ridiculous mostly about gambling.

328
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:47,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that same art style where the chins are really pointy It almost looks like an episode of yo.

329
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:49,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that, right?

330
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:59,160
Speaker 0: Yep So so we also live easily on geek nights Reviewed the show about tonogawa who was like the sub villain in Kaiji.

331
00:24:59,782 --> 00:25:02,149
Speaker 1: right exactly, so we did.

332
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:07,549
Speaker 1: this is a side story that tells you the Backstory of this character tonogawa.

333
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:07,830
Speaker 0: Mr.

334
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,400
Speaker 0: Tonogawa middle management blues, right?

335
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,629
Speaker 1: So that was sort of like this ridiculous weird side anime.

336
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:16,939
Speaker 1: and because that came out I watched that and we did a show on it.

337
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:24,048
Speaker 1: And then I said wait, this is a side story of Kaiji Which I've never actually watched or read right?

338
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:32,159
Speaker 1: so when the Kaiji manga was listed for sale volume one I was like, alright, I'll just pick up volume one and see what the deal is, right?

339
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:32,883
Speaker 1: And then I'll.

340
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:35,780
Speaker 1: I've already seen some middle management blues.

341
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:40,660
Speaker 1: I can sort of connect the dots here, right and see what the deal is.

342
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:42,549
Speaker 1: So I got volume one of Kaiji.

343
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,720
Speaker 1: It seems to be a very large volume in English.

344
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,760
Speaker 1: I'm wonder if they're combining several Japanese volumes together to produce the one English one just to get things moving along.

345
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:55,608
Speaker 1: Not sure how long the actual manga is Right.

346
00:25:55,648 --> 00:25:59,226
Speaker 1: the original one 71 volumes.

347
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:05,500
Speaker 1: Yes, so that they probably are combining Together to get them to fit into one, you know.

348
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,000
Speaker 1: So you don't have to buy 71 separate volumes because nobody in America will do that.

349
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,420
Speaker 0: So the thing I got to say and then we'll talk about like what this is actually about is as I read it.

350
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:20,826
Speaker 0: I read the first like fifth of this book and I was actually kind of into it Because it was moving pretty quick.

351
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:23,520
Speaker 0: Like this is one of those manga you can just read so fast.

352
00:26:24,213 --> 00:26:26,376
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah because there's the most manga you can read.

353
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:29,467
Speaker 0: so but this particular because the visuals don't really like.

354
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:31,954
Speaker 0: they're very simple and it's just the words.

355
00:26:32,035 --> 00:26:43,462
Speaker 0: and like a guy looking and then a guy looking from a different angle a lot of just people yelling at each other and the narrator explaining what's going on and Right up until they explained the rules of the first game They were gonna play.

356
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:49,684
Speaker 0: I was actually kind of into it because it was moving so fast and they explained the rules Exactly.

357
00:26:49,765 --> 00:26:52,136
Speaker 0: Like I really like it was a real game with real rules.

358
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:52,980
Speaker 0: They explained the rules.

359
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,619
Speaker 0: Well, it was an excellent example of teaching the rules to a board game.

360
00:26:57,543 --> 00:27:10,389
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and then my enjoyment of this manga and my desire to read more drops at a steady rate from that point forward until the end of this volume at which point I realized that I Literally never need to read more of this.

361
00:27:10,992 --> 00:27:12,640
Speaker 1: I am a hundred percent agreeing.

362
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:24,927
Speaker 0: So little happens in this like inch and a half almost two inch thick book like I can summarize the entirety of this book in like a Minute if I had to write it's.

363
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:29,060
Speaker 1: that's the thing is like what's happening is actually good stuff.

364
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:31,110
Speaker 1: It's just happening too slowly.

365
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not enough of it, right?

366
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,290
Speaker 1: So it's like I care about the characters a little bit.

367
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:35,893
Speaker 1: I care about.

368
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:37,460
Speaker 1: the scenario is interesting.

369
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,854
Speaker 1: You know what's going on the mystery what this whole deal is.

370
00:27:40,914 --> 00:27:42,400
Speaker 1: you can even though you can sort of figure it out.

371
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:50,009
Speaker 0: Yeah And if you watch Shona gawa even of two episodes in then that'll actually tell you exactly what I can't use them Gaka, what Kaiji is about right?

372
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:51,654
Speaker 0: Of course because that is literally the.

373
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:57,010
Speaker 0: the story of tona gawa is Here's the big bad villain who made this cruise ship and why?

374
00:27:57,672 --> 00:27:59,216
Speaker 0: yep, and the answer is stupid.

375
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,159
Speaker 1: and how yeah How and why how and why?

376
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,421
Speaker 1: But

377
00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:31,040
Speaker 0: like it spends like over a hundred pages Dealing with a character Figuring something out and slowly explaining it to two other characters Multiple times until they get it and the thing they are figuring out and spending these hundred plus pages describing is Hey, if people play all the rock cards and rock-paper-scissor Then suddenly all the scissor cards become a lot more powerful.

378
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:32,245
Speaker 0: Like that's it.

379
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:32,967
Speaker 0: That's that's it.

380
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:36,100
Speaker 0: That is literally hundred pages to explain that kind of concept.

381
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:42,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know, it starts out, you know, you get this poor guy Kaiji who likes to to.

382
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:44,046
Speaker 1: you know, Gamble or whatever.

383
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:45,335
Speaker 0: Well, no, he doesn't like to gamble.

384
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:46,140
Speaker 0: He doesn't gamble.

385
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:50,858
Speaker 0: He likes to deface Mercedes-Benz cars because he's a shit ass loser.

386
00:28:51,018 --> 00:28:56,080
Speaker 1: Oh, right That shows it like I haven't read it in a while cuz I gave this to rim like weeks ago.

387
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:03,784
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, so it's like I can't even remember that part cuz it was so brief Interesting like the.

388
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:05,991
Speaker 0: the intro is really good this piece of shit dude.

389
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:08,780
Speaker 0: It's just wandering around like being a piece of shit.

390
00:29:09,103 --> 00:29:16,372
Speaker 0: He's he's got no money He's kind of a jerk and he Defaces all these Mercedes-Benz's because he's mad and jealous that people have them.

391
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:22,060
Speaker 1: and then he and his friend scams him Yep, and then he finds one that's particularly fancy.

392
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:25,239
Speaker 0: So he defaces the ever-living shit out of it.

393
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:28,169
Speaker 0: Then he goes home and he hangs their hood ornament.

394
00:29:28,189 --> 00:29:36,540
Speaker 0: he stole on his door and someone knocks on the door and he's like oh fuck I can't let whoever that is see my Collection of Ben's ornaments.

395
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,463
Speaker 0: What if it's his car?

396
00:29:37,784 --> 00:29:41,796
Speaker 0: totally is his car and the guy is like listen your other friend scammed you.

397
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:46,720
Speaker 0: you owe us an Insane amount of money and I'm a Yakuza and I'm gonna fuck you up.

398
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,343
Speaker 0: We should talk.

399
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:51,020
Speaker 0: and then Kaiji's like, oh, let's uh, let's go to a cafe.

400
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:58,965
Speaker 0: He was like fine follow me and they go down to his car and he's like, uh, so I got a flat tire Mm-hmm, and like this.

401
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:06,528
Speaker 0: stuff's all kind of like there's a fun thing going on, but then they get on a boat and just fucking Nothing happens after I.

402
00:30:06,969 --> 00:30:10,200
Speaker 1: it's one of those scenario situations like nine doors nine.

403
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:23,459
Speaker 1: Whatever right is that there's some evil people who are for some reason running a cruise ship Where people who are down on their luck in some way right want to get on the cruise ship to you know And they're locked into the scenario, right?

404
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:36,140
Speaker 1: they can't escape where they have to play these games and win at these games and if they manage to do so and Succeed there's some huge prize at the end for them and they can escape their shitty lives and solve their problems.

405
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:40,580
Speaker 1: But it seems that there are horrifying and mysterious consequences for all the losers.

406
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:49,364
Speaker 1: Yep Like soundproof rooms where there's still screams coming out of them and there's some evil organization running the whole show And no one knows.

407
00:30:49,384 --> 00:30:54,160
Speaker 1: you don't really start, you know, they don't tell you why or who or anything at least not in volume one.

408
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:00,704
Speaker 1: Yep, and the scenarios that they've set up for these players to play are Simple but interesting.

409
00:31:00,884 --> 00:31:05,236
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the first game is literally rock-paper-scissors, but you know what the game they play.

410
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:13,100
Speaker 0: this rock-paper-scissors is Honestly a legit good game like it would be fun to play this at a convention in a panel room, right?

411
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,244
Speaker 1: You have a room full of people.

412
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:18,860
Speaker 1: Everyone is given an equal number of rock paper and scissors cards, right?

413
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,300
Speaker 1: You can't just throw whatever you want.

414
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, right if you go to a table and challenge someone you both play a card simultaneous.

415
00:31:24,876 --> 00:31:26,080
Speaker 0: you both have to consent.

416
00:31:26,883 --> 00:31:28,169
Speaker 1: Right you both have to consent to it.

417
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:34,515

Speaker 0: Well, it's like there's.

421
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:53,041
Speaker 0: it's a game mechanic That is this is actually the same game mechanic that train board games have in that at the start of the match You've got your three stars You've got your paper rock-scissors cards and then they let you take out a loan between what like 1 and 20 or 15 You can take.

422
00:31:53,082 --> 00:32:01,063
Speaker 0: but you could take between 1 and 15 million yen like something like that like but the interest compounds every 10 minutes Mm-hmm.

423
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:03,192
Speaker 0: So how much do you take out?

424
00:32:03,352 --> 00:32:05,200
Speaker 0: Do you take out the smallest loan of the biggest loan?

425
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,378
Speaker 0: What's that money for?

426
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,360
Speaker 0: And I love the fact that the game master very succinctly explains the rules of paper rock-scissors.

427
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:12,618
Speaker 0: Like how are you gonna play the game?

428
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:24,940
Speaker 0: Because once you win once you play a match win or lose the cards that were used in the match are taken out of the game forever And at the end of the game anyone who has three or more stars lives.

429
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:32,662
Speaker 0: Anyone who has less than three stars or who still has even one card on them dies Right.

430
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:35,320
Speaker 1: So you have to get rid of all your cards right safely.

431
00:32:35,481 --> 00:32:37,832
Speaker 1: So it's like you have if you start with you know, what they start with.

432
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,440
Speaker 1: three of each two of each something like that.

433
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forget how many they start with some number of each.

434
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:49,120
Speaker 0: you have to get rid of the cards somehow Meaning you gotta play you gotta play the paper rock-scissors somehow.

435
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:56,420
Speaker 1: But they start to reveal as the game goes on is like basically like all the things they don't say Right are not rules.

436
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:07,793
Speaker 1: It's like oh I could just win a couple rock-paper-scissors get up to three stars And as long as I can find someone to take my cards, yep Right, or maybe I'll sell a star to someone for 10 million yen, right?

437
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:10,199
Speaker 1: Or maybe I'll trade a star for some cards.

438
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:17,170
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like oh, well that person lost a bunch and they're running out of cards I bet and I've won a bunch and I have cards.

439
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:19,560
Speaker 1: they need cards to play more rock-paper-scissors.

440
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:24,140
Speaker 0: I saw that guy play scissors like eight times.

441
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:31,459
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go over there assuming he's out of scissors, right and because your cards are limited You can't just throw whatever you want to throw, you know.

442
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,580
Speaker 1: So it's actually kind of an interesting scenario that they've come up with.

443
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,079
Speaker 1: Yeah That makes me interested to see how it plays out.

444
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:40,412
Speaker 1: But it plays out over such a long period of time.

445
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:41,676
Speaker 0: plays out over an inch of paper.

446
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:50,980
Speaker 1: They could have had this whole rock-paper-scissors Part of the ship because you know that there's gonna be other rooms with other games as the tournament goes on.

447
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, right This should have been one episode like one volume.

448
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:55,440
Speaker 0: is the rock-paper-scissors game done?

449
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,720
Speaker 1: You could have done two episodes for the rock-paper-scissors.

450
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,530
Speaker 0: True the first half and then the second half.

451
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:01,079
Speaker 0: after they figure out how fucked they are.

452
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:06,460
Speaker 1: Right exactly the first half where it's like the setup and the early play and then shit gets crazy.

453
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:08,860
Speaker 1: They figure things out and then it finishes, right?

454
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,460
Speaker 1: That's what you do with the rock-paper-scissors and you move on to the next game.

455
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:15,250
Speaker 1: Then this would have been like the great one of the great mangas.

456
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:17,659
Speaker 1: just you know, not great but like super fun.

457
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:19,148
Speaker 1: I would have bought volume 2.

458
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:22,877
Speaker 0: no questions asked right, but no It's just in slow motion.

459
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:25,300
Speaker 1: The pace is so slow.

460
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:32,179
Speaker 0: Characters will say the same thing to another character like four times in the span of ten pages.

461
00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:33,665
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah, I'm very.

462
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:42,616
Speaker 0: the characters are dumb like they're dumb to the point that they keep like Re-explaining things to each other because they don't understand each other.

463
00:34:42,696 --> 00:34:43,719
Speaker 0: I don't need to see that.

464
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,708
Speaker 0: I don't need to read that.

465
00:34:44,728 --> 00:34:45,839
Speaker 0: you can skip that part.

466
00:34:46,556 --> 00:34:50,077
Speaker 0: Yeah Like that's the part of the rpg where the game master is like, all right.

467
00:34:50,097 --> 00:34:50,399
Speaker 0: All right.

468
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:51,467
Speaker 0: All right Let's skip all that.

469
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:52,899
Speaker 0: roll the falsehood test.

470
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:57,486
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't think kaiji Became an.

471
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,059
Speaker 1: is it an anime also?

472
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,660
Speaker 0: There is a kaiji anime, but i'm pretty sure it takes place long after that cruise ship.

473
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:08,369
Speaker 1: You lose day by day gambling making small debt.

474
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:09,693
Speaker 0: yeah, look at what the first episode is.

475
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,179
Speaker 0: he's like escape from a work camp or something.

476
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:17,400
Speaker 1: uh-huh I know it looks like kaiji's automatic.

477
00:35:17,621 --> 00:35:21,740
Speaker 1: I don't know how far they get in the yeah

478
00:35:22,904 --> 00:35:42,987
Speaker 0: But like I can this manga unless you Have an infinite amount of patience to read an inch and a half two inch thick book At the end of which you don't even find out who wins rock paper scissors Because the last page is not them Doing the last rock paper scissors.

479
00:35:43,348 --> 00:35:45,153
Speaker 0: It's not even close to being done.

480
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:47,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks like the kaiji anime.

481
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,090
Speaker 1: Uh, that's listed here.

482
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:53,062
Speaker 1: Oh, there's ultimate survivor Right.

483
00:35:53,162 --> 00:35:54,426
Speaker 1: Oh ultimate skull kaiji.

484
00:35:54,506 --> 00:36:00,740
Speaker 1: ultimate survivor is 26 episodes and it seems like the rock paper scissors ends.

485
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,513
Speaker 1: uh At least yeah, it goes on for several episodes.

486
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:13,531
Speaker 0: Oh god At least initial d was always the the setup the get to the race The first part of the race the second part of the race.

487
00:36:13,612 --> 00:36:18,895
Speaker 1: I can see here that in episode three They're definitely playing rock paper scissors and in episode nine.

488
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:21,930
Speaker 1: They are Still play episode eight and nine.

489
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,894
Speaker 1: They're still playing rock paper.

490
00:36:23,075 --> 00:36:28,494
Speaker 1: Oh, no So And there's another anime kaiji against all rules.

491
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:29,720
Speaker 1: That's the one with the work camp.

492
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,340
Speaker 1: Um, yeah, I think that must take place after the first season.

493
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:37,879
Speaker 1: So i'm not sure which manga volumes those anime episodes line up to.

494
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:43,500
Speaker 1: I guess it would take less time to watch these two seasons of anime than to read all the manga.

495
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:44,968
Speaker 1: But who wants to watch?

496
00:36:44,988 --> 00:36:47,320
Speaker 1: I just read a whole volume of rock paper scissors.

497
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,931
Speaker 1: I don't want to watch five episodes of rock paper scissors.

498
00:36:50,032 --> 00:37:05,872
Speaker 0: It should be two episodes of rock paper scissors Yep, but also the worst part is uh, maybe this might be something that only applies to me and scott and like super like Heavy tabletop gamers, but uh I fully understood All the tricks they came up with.

499
00:37:05,912 --> 00:37:06,073
Speaker 0: like.

500
00:37:06,255 --> 00:37:09,330
Speaker 0: that's the kind of shit I had already thought of just by hearing the rules.

501
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:11,037
Speaker 1: like I thought of 90 of it at the start.

502
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought about making the futures market buying cards from people But what?

503
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:18,371
Speaker 0: but at the same time it also they didn't.

504
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:20,999
Speaker 0: even there were better ways to handle this than they even handled it.

505
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:30,940
Speaker 0: yeah, like I don't want to get into it, but there's a lot of ways you could Safely progress through this game without taking the risk that these characters took.

506
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:34,980
Speaker 0: But I guess it makes sense because these characters are like canonically stupid.

507
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:36,925
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think another part of it.

508
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:37,627
Speaker 1: Is that the?

509
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:42,940
Speaker 1: well kaiji is stupid but like he figures things out like he gets Yeah, he's just a step behind.

510
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,629
Speaker 0: It's like the one omega thought to be watched for.

511
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:49,393
Speaker 0: the one guy really sucked at rampart But started to figure it out as the match went on.

512
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:50,960
Speaker 1: right that's what kaiji is.

513
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,769
Speaker 1: He's a guy who figures things out as time goes on.

514
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:59,340
Speaker 1: but I think part of the problem is that there's none of the even Those characters you don't really identify with any of them or care.

515
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:00,345
Speaker 0: Nope, it's like kaiji.

516
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:03,600
Speaker 0: you're a piece of shit and there are a lot of better ways to handle your situation.

517
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:04,372
Speaker 1: Right.

518
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:06,207
Speaker 1: They don't really Other than like.

519
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:08,260
Speaker 1: each character is really kind of thin.

520
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:12,980
Speaker 1: There's not a lot to their personality or backstory or anything to make you know or care about them.

521
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:16,191
Speaker 1: So it's really just all about the scenario itself.

522
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:18,779
Speaker 1: Yep, and that doesn't carry enough.

523
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:21,682
Speaker 0: nope, I Would.

524
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:23,065
Speaker 0: i've seen people like people.

525
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:28,900
Speaker 0: i've seen people run this scenario the rock paper scissors game in conventions before like in panel rooms.

526
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:30,603
Speaker 0: That's been a thing.

527
00:38:30,903 --> 00:38:32,527
Speaker 0: It even got submitted to connecticut a few times.

528
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:39,300
Speaker 0: I forget if I ever scheduled it but uh Yeah, I I can't recommend this to anyone.

529
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,740
Speaker 1: Like I can recommend it if the if the the the because it's also sort of crazy, right?

530
00:38:46,002 --> 00:38:46,768
Speaker 1: Scenario.

531
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,762
Speaker 0: but i'm just gonna read spoilers I'm just gonna go.

532
00:38:48,782 --> 00:38:54,956
Speaker 0: well, actually I don't need to because I know the deal with the boat because I watched the beginning of mr tonogawa Exactly.

533
00:38:54,997 --> 00:39:09,380
Speaker 0: Mr Tony if you are intrigued by this and you read this first volume of kaiji But you want to find out the end just go watch like the first three or four episodes of mr Tonogawa middle management blues and that will literally reveal everything you care about.

534
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:16,228
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much and while the answer is stupid It's also pretty funny like what the bar.

535
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:20,160
Speaker 0: I actually I enjoy what this cruise ship actually is.

536
00:39:20,854 --> 00:39:31,616
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah That's what i'm saying is like what's actually going on is so crazy and sort of fun and ridiculous That it's like that genre of the ridiculous anime with the crazy stuff happening right is great.

537
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:40,760
Speaker 1: But if only This had the ridiculous things happening faster and more in less pages than it would be worth worth my time.

538
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:46,880
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a movie I don't remember what it was called like the test or something the exam.

539
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:53,316
Speaker 0: There's a movie that is this essentially but it's uh, i'm not gonna say it's good.

540
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:54,760
Speaker 0: I think it's just called exam.

541
00:39:55,641 --> 00:39:58,230
Speaker 1: It's in the same genre as you know battle royale.

542
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:58,491
Speaker 1: Yes.

543
00:39:58,712 --> 00:39:59,756
Speaker 0: The movie is called exam.

544
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:01,242
Speaker 0: It's from 2009.

545
00:40:01,242 --> 00:40:04,560
Speaker 0: It's a low-budget film and it's this kind of scenario.

546
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:09,623
Speaker 0: It's like eight people are locked in a room and they have to take nine doors nine Whatever.

547
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:11,052
Speaker 1: we talk about these things all the time.

548
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:12,360
Speaker 1: There's these scenario based.

549
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:15,059
Speaker 1: Uh, what's the one we watched where the kids were like in it?

550
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,473
Speaker 1: They were people moved went to a village that was in the in the mountain or something.

551
00:40:18,654 --> 00:40:19,176
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

552
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:26,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, right There's always these things but basically uh I would almost say if you're not sure if you want to deal with.

553
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,618
Speaker 1: Boca rana was technically sort of in that in that genre true, but it does have a lot else going on.

554
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,592
Speaker 1: Boca rana doesn't have the isolation that these other ones.

555
00:40:33,612 --> 00:40:35,542
Speaker 0: Yeah, because exam is more like kaiji It is.

556
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:38,580
Speaker 0: these people are locked in one room for the entire movie.

557
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:39,708
Speaker 1: So I mean there's still.

558
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:51,899
Speaker 1: those are all in the scenario genre But this is in the more common isolated scenario where a group of people are trapped at a place and forced Into this complicated scenario with a bunch of made-up rules, right?

559
00:40:52,581 --> 00:41:07,839
Speaker 0: I would almost say go watch the 2009 film exam And if you want to see a version of that movie that instead of being 101 minutes long Is a thousand and one minutes long but tells the same story then kaiji is the manga for you.

560
00:41:08,403 --> 00:41:15,073
Speaker 1: I say just watch all the other things in that same isolated scenario genre that have faster pacing.

561
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:22,860
Speaker 1: and if you want to see ridiculous animes Watch different ones that are ridiculous that aren't this, you know one could argue that 12 angry men is in this genre.

562
00:41:24,242 --> 00:41:28,557
Speaker 0: Uh sort of yeah, there is 12 people locked in a room with the scenario.

563
00:41:28,597 --> 00:41:33,819
Speaker 0: They got to deal with Yeah, and no outside help No escape, but to solve the scenario.

564
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:48,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think the difference is that in most of these scenario Um, they're real like they're really character driven but kaiji is actually scenario driven primarily right, and but it's also that they're um the the.

565
00:41:48,748 --> 00:41:55,914
Speaker 1: the conflict is between The players who are trapped and the outside forces, uh, assailing them.

566
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:59,502
Speaker 0: Yeah, 12 angry men is not about jury nullification Right.

567
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:01,536
Speaker 1: No 12 angry men is about racism.

568
00:42:01,556 --> 00:42:14,798
Speaker 1: Yep So, uh, but in 12 angry men the conflict is you know between you know It's more societal and ephemeral and also between the people that are trapped in there, right?

569
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:15,139
Speaker 1: I don't know.

570
00:42:16,462 --> 00:42:21,080
Speaker 1: The conflict is in a different spot even though it's still a scenario based situation.

571
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:25,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I do not need to ever read more kaiji like good.

572
00:42:26,058 --> 00:42:27,523
Speaker 0: No god I do.

573
00:42:27,623 --> 00:42:32,120
Speaker 1: and I think I think that you know, well i'm not personally turned off by the unique art style.

574
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:35,734
Speaker 1: I know a lot of people that are yeah, i'm actually fine.

575
00:42:35,895 --> 00:42:37,240
Speaker 0: I don't mind the art style at all.

576
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:38,540
Speaker 0: I just wish it moved faster.

577
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:43,819
Speaker 1: No, it's like you notice it a lot the first time you watch because it's so unique and different and kind of messed up.

578
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:48,480
Speaker 1: But once you you know, I stopped noticing it and stop, you know, it's okay.

579
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:53,599
Speaker 0: The only problem is I noticed that kaiji basically makes eight different faces and just rotates between them.

580
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:55,784
Speaker 0: Sure and it's it's like.

581
00:42:56,065 --> 00:42:57,850
Speaker 0: he's concerned but sweating.

582
00:42:58,111 --> 00:42:59,354
Speaker 0: he's angry but sweating.

583
00:42:59,575 --> 00:43:02,864
Speaker 0: he's despairing but sweating he's Happy but sweating.

584
00:43:02,925 --> 00:43:06,810
Speaker 0: and then there's another variant of all the same phases, but he's not sweating Like.

585
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:07,176
Speaker 1: that's it.

586
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:11,959
Speaker 0: Those are the only faces he makes Sure, and then he has one ultra despairing face.

587
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:16,617
Speaker 1: It's not you know, even though even though it does have a unique style which has its own merits.

588
00:43:16,757 --> 00:43:19,087
Speaker 1: It is not a Masterpiece of drawing.

589
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:19,891
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

590
00:43:20,072 --> 00:43:21,279
Speaker 1: that's not what you're reading this for.

591
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:29,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I read this as fast as possible Like I just blew through it and it still was way too sparse for me to deal with.

592
00:43:29,521 --> 00:43:34,420
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go just read spoilers on all the games they play and see if the rules are as good as this rock paper scissors.

593
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:43,620
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Definitely the imagination to come up with the rock paper scissors game alone gives me hope for the imagination of the the future.

594
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,619
Speaker 1: You know games that the players will be trapped in, you know.

595
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,205
Speaker 1: Hopefully there are more.

596
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:57,960
Speaker 1: the thing is I worry that they'll only be a few games right because yeah 4,000 episodes they play three games right if they would have come up with more games.

597
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,512
Speaker 1: They could have had less episodes per game.

598
00:43:59,794 --> 00:44:00,459
Speaker 0: You know what we could do.

599
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:00,861
Speaker 0: We should.

600
00:44:01,624 --> 00:44:07,206
Speaker 0: this is this is a pax panel that we could do during the quarantine when we got nothing better to do The kind of panel no one would accept.

601
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:09,153
Speaker 0: Let's make your own cruise gambling.

602
00:44:09,173 --> 00:44:10,237
Speaker 0: No, let's read.

603
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:15,299
Speaker 0: Well, maybe that Let's just read the rules to all the games in kaiji and review them as games.

604
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:22,320
Speaker 0: Huh because I could do a full-on review of this, uh limited rock paper scissors a restricted rock rock paper scissors.

605
00:44:22,441 --> 00:44:23,287
Speaker 1: It's a real game.

606
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:24,496
Speaker 1: I absolutely could.

607
00:44:24,556 --> 00:44:25,060
Speaker 1: it's a good game.

608
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,899
Speaker 0: You could you could publish this and sell it and people would buy it and people would enjoy it.

609
00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:30,936
Speaker 1: You could put kaiji art on it.

610
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:34,530
Speaker 0: Yeah I've seen people have have made those cards.

611
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,896
Speaker 0: Like i've seen those around at cons.

612
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:36,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

613
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,904
Speaker 1: All right, kaiji cosplayers.

614
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, i've seen kaiji cosplayers, but they might have been akagi cosplayers.

615
00:44:41,977 --> 00:44:42,740
Speaker 0: I can't fucking tell.

616
00:44:43,444 --> 00:44:44,159
Speaker 1: I can't tell either.

635
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:32,956
Speaker 1: He's making a supreme effort.

636
00:46:32,996 --> 00:46:34,040
Speaker 1: I think I can guess why.

637
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:35,402
Speaker 1: That's right.

638
00:46:35,863 --> 00:46:41,420
Speaker 1: a carrot growing out here free and wild probably the result of a stray seed pooped out by a passing bird.

639
00:46:43,281 --> 00:46:43,764
Speaker 1: What's this?

640
00:46:43,784 --> 00:46:44,609
Speaker 1: there is?

641
00:46:44,689 --> 00:46:46,620
Speaker 1: rustling in the bush could mean trouble.

642
00:46:47,242 --> 00:46:47,483
Speaker 1: Mr.

643
00:46:47,563 --> 00:46:48,667
Speaker 1: Bunny seems to think so.

644
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:52,079
Speaker 1: his sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger.

645
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,735
Speaker 1: Unfortunately for mr.

646
00:46:55,796 --> 00:46:58,450
Speaker 1: Bunny, this is what nature is all about.

647
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:03,254
Speaker 0: It's a male deer.

648
00:47:03,756 --> 00:47:04,719
Speaker 1: not a threat to mr.

649
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:08,129
Speaker 1: Bunny in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain.

650
00:47:08,872 --> 00:47:09,113
Speaker 1: Mr.

651
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:12,648
Speaker 1: Bunny wishing to avoid an encounter hops away to safety.

652
00:47:15,891 --> 00:47:17,356
Speaker 1: Wow, deers are jerks.

653
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:20,208

00:47:22,871 --> 00:47:27,306
Speaker 0: No, I had no idea yeah, but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie and I left it on.

00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:28,329
