14
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:25,730
Speaker 1: We like all the crap.

15
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:29,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've done how many episodes we never did a promo I know isn't it crazy?

16
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:30,570
Speaker 0: it's about time.

17
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:35,450
Speaker 1: It also might mean there might be an influx of a bunch of new people who hear our promo on other shows.

18
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,735
Speaker 0: Yeah, unlike the previous.

19
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,503
Speaker 0: I don't know like five influxes.

20
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:44,470
Speaker 1: We've had I know right We're just waiting for the one big influx where like our listenership quintuples.

21
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,195
Speaker 0: If anything that might be.

22
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:48,847
Speaker 0: once we do our live show at Otacon, it might be yep.

23
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:52,701
Speaker 0: But anyway, as we promised today, we're going to be doing our.

24
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:57,362
Speaker 0: the listeners interview us episode At least the first of these.

25
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,274
Speaker 0: we might do it again sometime Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:02,090
Speaker 1: This is very easy to do when we get a whole bunch of more listeners.

27
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:05,228
Speaker 1: You know they have a whole enough new questions to ask us.

28
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:11,636
Speaker 0: Thus we'll be kind of quick on the news and things of the day mostly because one we want to fit as many of these Questions in as we can.

29
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:12,119
Speaker 1: Yep.

30
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,506
Speaker 1: We're probably gonna do all of them.

31
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,269
Speaker 1: If not most of them.

32
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:23,046
Speaker 0: Yep, and two I kind of want to get to sleep because we're basically recording two and a half Times the number of pot the amount of podcast we usually record tonight.

33
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:23,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're going it.

34
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,877
Speaker 1: We're doing a podcast a whole shit ton of it.

35
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:29,290
Speaker 1: going to sleep waking up going to work going to the beach.

36
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,208
Speaker 1: That's our schedule right now.

37
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,213
Speaker 1: Okay So, let's see.

38
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:34,795
Speaker 1: start with the news.

39
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:35,919
Speaker 1: This is a quick news.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,210
Speaker 1: There's a guy named mark pilgrim who's been a crazy Mac user.

41
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,162
Speaker 1: He's had using Mac since 1984 when I was two.

42
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:43,548
Speaker 0: He has a Mac tattoo.

43
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,989
Speaker 1: Yeah He's a Mac Apple tattoo on his right bicep and he's owned 50 Macs at least.

44
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:56,795
Speaker 1: He is switching to Ubuntu after becoming fed up with proprietary Mac file formats and the increasing use of DRM Technologies in the Mac OS.

45
00:02:57,317 --> 00:03:01,030
Speaker 1: why didn't this guy talk and do this before we bought a Mac?

46
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,719
Speaker 0: I want to try and get him on the show Bailey.

47
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,570
Speaker 1: that might be a good idea.

48
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:11,783
Speaker 0: I would like to talk to him because I want to see what he has to say because honestly though I haven't used the Mac very thoroughly like.

49
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:21,710
Speaker 0: I haven't used it as my Daily computer for all my normal stuff, but I used it a lot for non podcasting And I liked it except for the podcasting bit, but I didn't put it to heavy use.

50
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,197
Speaker 0: I'm really curious what this guy has to say.

51
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:26,978
Speaker 1: I don't know how much he's into the podcasting So, I don't know how much insight.

52
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,629
Speaker 0: Well, no, I mean I want to ask him about everything else.

53
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:29,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, everything else.

54
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:31,243
Speaker 1: This guy seems like a good choice.

55
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:32,530
Speaker 1: Maybe we should send him an email.

56
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:35,804
Speaker 0: If anything, I'd like to get an email response that we could read.

57
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:36,689
Speaker 1: that would be cool, too.

58
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:39,990
Speaker 0: Cuz I realize you know listening to anime world order which I want to plug again.

59
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,306
Speaker 0: We even we plugged anime world order on the other podcast that we were talking on God.

60
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:46,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, just keep it.

61
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:49,783
Speaker 1: It's like we don't even plug people anymore.

62
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:51,370
Speaker 1: But you know, I mean we are not shills.

63
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:54,910
Speaker 1: We do not plug people, you know out of because we want them to be promoted.

64
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,139
Speaker 1: We're not plug people because someone paid us or told us to.

65
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,020
Speaker 1: yeah, like when we say we mentioned something else It's because we're mentioning it.

66
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,229
Speaker 1: we just do it so often.

67
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:10,316
Speaker 0: Yeah And like if we ever play a promo or anything You can we can guarantee to you that we would only ever play a promo if it was a show we actually do or would Listen to.

68
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,349
Speaker 1: yeah, you know what it is.

69
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,816
Speaker 1: It's like if I mentioned the Simpsons.

70
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,890
Speaker 1: people don't go all your shilling the Simpsons because it's a popular thing.

71
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,368
Speaker 1: You don't shill it you just refer to it.

72
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:23,407
Speaker 1: But when you refer to something very unpopular and amateur like a podcast it comes off as a promotion.

73
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:37,050
Speaker 0: you see Plus also while we were just on this podcast We sent a long audio feedback to anime world order and they sent us a long email response Which I then responded to with a longer email response response.

74
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,763
Speaker 1: And then I did a little uh, you know additional punch with a tiny email.

75
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:42,570
Speaker 1: Yep, relatively tiny email.

76
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,386
Speaker 0: Yeah, only because as Scott said the beginning of his email rim was very thorough.

77
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:48,209
Speaker 1: He was indeed.

78
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,865
Speaker 0: Okay So you'll be able to hear us on at least two other podcasts in the near future.

79
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:53,387
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

80
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:56,157
Speaker 0: But anyway, uh, that's it.

81
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:56,879
Speaker 0: Let's do some news.

82
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:58,184
Speaker 1: We did the news.

83
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,950
Speaker 1: My news was this guy who?

84
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,433
Speaker 0: Alright, right.

85
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:03,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're going kind of quick here.

86
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,370
Speaker 1: We want to get to the questions, which is the fun part.

87
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:07,498
Speaker 0: Yep, you know, I don't have a news.

88
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:17,668
Speaker 0: I'll just note that the Supreme Court of the United States Basically just told the administration President Bush that they can't keep doing this Guantanamo Bay thing.

89
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,815
Speaker 1: Oh That was obvious.

90
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:21,582
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it really you know what.

91
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:24,470
Speaker 1: you can just go out on the street and ask any guy and they'll tell You that that's obvious.

92
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:42,910
Speaker 0: what surprised me was the way the Supreme Court ruled on it and also the fact that Roberts who was appointed by Bush and I really was leery of him and his leanings and how how Loyal he would be to the administration versus how loyal he would be to his judicial ethics.

93
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:52,350
Speaker 0: And he actually bowed out of this decision because he sat on the lower court's ruling Mm-hmm, and I just I I have a little bit more respect for this guy as a result.

94
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:57,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was leery of him too at first but as time goes on I'm less worried about him.

95
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:59,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, but well it remains to be seen.

96
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:01,583
Speaker 0: still I'm more leery of skeletal.

97
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:03,610
Speaker 1: Yes, but you know, what do you want?

98
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:12,905
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'll just note that this is actually probably very important news But the consequences and ramifications will not come out for many weeks or months.

99
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,469
Speaker 1: That's always the problem with things.

100
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:17,542
Speaker 0: Well mainly because the Supreme Court has no enforcement power.

101
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:18,747
Speaker 0: I mean a long time.

102
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,490
Speaker 1: Don't they have marshals?

103
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,349
Speaker 0: They have federal marshals, but it doesn't quite work the way you might think it would work.

104
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:28,628
Speaker 0: I mean if anyone isn't really familiar with American history, there is a point where Andrew Jackson who?

105
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:40,170
Speaker 0: I honestly have a very low opinion of this man, though I have a high opinion of the fact that I have a high opinion of his Testicles, yeah, I have a low opinion of his ideas.

106
00:06:40,832 --> 00:06:41,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like he did.

107
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:45,850
Speaker 0: he was really good at doing things, but the things he did were bad.

108
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:54,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like someone who's you know knows how to get the job done and has the balls to just do the job But at the same time what his the job he tries to do is stupid.

109
00:06:55,375 --> 00:07:04,609
Speaker 0: Well to make a long story short He wanted to wipe out the Native Americans in an area and he wanted to do something with like this National bank business all sorts of bad stuff.

110
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,790
Speaker 0: well It was real bad bad stuff or at least things that weren't really so constitutional.

111
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:10,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the Supreme Court.

112
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:14,350
Speaker 0: and John Marshall the head of the Supreme Court said the best Supreme Court justice ever.

113
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,438
Speaker 0: He said no, you can't do that.

114
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,722
Speaker 0: It is unconstitutional.

115
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:18,565
Speaker 0: the Supreme Court ruled.

116
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:24,410
Speaker 0: I think almost unanimously and Andrew Jackson said the famous words John Marshall has made his decision.

117
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,316
Speaker 0: Let's see him and force it.

118
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:30,974
Speaker 1: yep, and the only way he can do that is with US marshals of course back Then he couldn't.

119
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:33,710
Speaker 0: so Jackson just marched the army out and killed all the Indians.

120
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:39,268
Speaker 1: Yep, it was a dark day in American history very dark, and now he's on the $20 bill.

121
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:39,770
Speaker 1: Andrew Jackson.

122
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:41,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, funny how that works.

123
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,478
Speaker 0: Abraham Lincoln's on money.

124
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:43,441
Speaker 0: He was kind of a cock.

125
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:45,448
Speaker 0: Thomas Jefferson got dicked with a $2 bill.

126
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,197
Speaker 1: Yeah, Thomas Jefferson is like no money.

127
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:50,344
Speaker 0: What the hell Ben Franklin's okay?

128
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:51,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's on the hundred.

129
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:52,190
Speaker 1: That's that's cool.

130
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,076
Speaker 0: He's on the big bill.

131
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:54,930
Speaker 0: Yep course then we got like grant.

132
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:56,917
Speaker 0: What a grant ever do?

133
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:57,961
Speaker 1: I don't know.

134
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:59,988
Speaker 1: didn't they have $50 bills before grant?

135
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:00,450
Speaker 1: who was on it?

136
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,085
Speaker 1: Then I don't know they should take grant off and put on Teddy Roosevelt.

137
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:05,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt's the man.

138
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:07,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, no he should be on something weird like the three dollar at 80 cent.

139
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:08,917
Speaker 1: They should be on the 50.

140
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,360
Speaker 1: I'm telling you the 50 just sings.

141
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:25,798
Speaker 1: Teddy to me All right things of the day What you got all right.

142
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,350
Speaker 0: uh I didn't really have anything good for today And I thought about just skipping things of the day and getting right to the questions.

143
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:42,870
Speaker 0: But Scott had a decent thing of the day, so I came up with something I almost made my thing of the day the picture of Lisa and James's new baby bunnies because they're adorable even though you can only see a tiny ball of fur.

144
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're just indistinguishable balls of fuzz.

145
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,183
Speaker 0: so I'll make that my thing of the day once.

146
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:49,190
Speaker 0: They're more recognizable as bunnies.

147
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,390
Speaker 0: But instead I was poking around in the internet.

148
00:08:52,491 --> 00:09:01,450
Speaker 0: I actually searched for Hitler in Google video just to see if anything funny would come up And I saw something that looked like it was gonna be funny like someone voiced over Hitler funnily.

149
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,014
Speaker 0: But it just petered out and wasn't.

150
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:08,108
Speaker 0: and then I found the entirety of one of my favorite Monty Python sketches ever mr.

151
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,560
Speaker 0: Hilta, that's an excellent sketch yes, and I mr..

152
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:12,685
Speaker 1: Hilta escape.

153
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:15,597
Speaker 0: Hi, Kay.

154
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:17,510
Speaker 0: That's a map of Stalingrad.

155
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:20,446
Speaker 1: You got the wrong map.

156
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:24,300
Speaker 0: I Was never head of the Gestapo.

157
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:25,484
Speaker 0: yeah, it's just.

158
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,447
Speaker 0: it's really.

159
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:27,210
Speaker 0: you've never seen.

160
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:27,795
Speaker 0: I mean a lot.

161
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:29,290
Speaker 0: everyone's seen the Monty Python movies.

162
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:33,068
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people who have never actually seen Monty Python's Flying Circus.

163
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:39,952
Speaker 0: whoa If any of you out there have never seen any Monty Python's Flying Circus not just the movies But Flying Circus.

164
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,617
Speaker 0: watch my thing of the day.

165
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:44,243
Speaker 0: It's got Japanese subtitles in case someone wants that.

166
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:45,607
Speaker 0: but it's just.

167
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:46,890
Speaker 0: it's hilarious.

168
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,376
Speaker 0: I can't really say anything.

169
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,023
Speaker 1: Japanese not Chinese.

170
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:50,344
Speaker 0: Yes.

171
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:51,710
Speaker 0: I'm sure because I saw hiragana.

172
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:55,030
Speaker 1: Okay, my thing day is an awesome really quick video.

173
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:56,956
Speaker 1: You know those firecrackers.

174
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:57,237
Speaker 1: they were.

175
00:09:57,257 --> 00:10:04,550
Speaker 1: there's a string and you light the string and it goes through the firecrackers And they snap off in rapid succession as the fuse burns.

176
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,950
Speaker 1: You know it's like crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack in a line.

177
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:08,876
Speaker 0: Yep, like sometimes.

178
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:10,710
Speaker 0: I'd tear those apart to get a bunch of individual fire.

179
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, you usually take get a big roll of it, and you tear it up.

180
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,681
Speaker 1: You know it's like sets of like 20. you light it you throw it And then it cracks 20 times in a row.

181
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,768
Speaker 1: you know that sort of thing.

182
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:29,683
Speaker 1: some guys took a roll of 16,000 of these things and they rolled it up real tight and they let the end of it dangle about a foot down off the.

183
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:34,800
Speaker 1: you know the rest of the roll and they lit it and Ran away, and it starts to go as you expect.

184
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,328
Speaker 1: you know crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack.

185
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:45,295
Speaker 1: And as it gets closer to the actual roll not only does it go around the spiral But it actually starts.

186
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:59,152
Speaker 1: you know each firecracker sets off all the adjacent ones and there is 16,000 of them and it gets crazy And I must say it is perhaps one of the greatest firecracker displays of our time It's.

187
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,377
Speaker 0: I didn't really expect it.

188
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:06,022
Speaker 0: I thought it was just gonna Peter around and be a normal dumb video and It's it's amazing.

189
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:06,749
Speaker 0: It's inferno.

190
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:09,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's basically the only words I can use to describe it.

191
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:15,530
Speaker 0: But anyway as we promised today is the ask rim and Scott episode.

192
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,709
Speaker 1: Hooray, this is gonna be fun a lot of fun.

193
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:19,875
Speaker 1: We should do that.

194
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:22,790
Speaker 1: wish you could do it more often, but people run out of interesting questions.

195
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:28,136
Speaker 0: Yep, even though I gotta make fun of a few people's questions because they weren't the best questions Well, we'll do it.

196
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:32,600
Speaker 0: as the questions come yep And I think we're just gonna take them in a semi random order.

197
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:38,570
Speaker 0: and this will be an interesting thing because usually for anyone Who's noticed we don't really like when we get listener feedback?

198
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:42,269
Speaker 0: We tend to just say what like what the gist of what they said was and then talk about it.

199
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:55,239
Speaker 0: but every other radio show and Podcast out there actually reads the text of the emails they get or they get more voicemails and feedbacks Which I'm thinking about getting a pay for voicemail service.

200
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,466
Speaker 1: That doesn't suck like the one we had.

201
00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:01,260
Speaker 0: that failed that's broken But the phone number is still in our closing music.

202
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:02,506
Speaker 0: So we hope you're not calling it.

203
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,035
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah, we're.

204
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:11,369
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about paying for a real voicemail service Maybe with a cool phone number like something something something geek or something like that.

205
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:15,627
Speaker 0: Of course, you can always just email us feedback at geek nights at front row.

206
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:18,499
Speaker 1: crew calm Yeah, but some people don't know how to make an mp3.

207
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,527
Speaker 0: I am I am you know who you are.

208
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:24,888
Speaker 0: Yeah So we're just gonna handle these in kind of random order.

209
00:12:24,908 --> 00:12:28,017
Speaker 1: and Well, no particular order not random ordering.

210
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:40,576
Speaker 1: if we don't answer your question or we didn't get to it or whatever We're sorry, just say so in the forums or via email and we will send you either an email response or a forum response Or we'll make fun of you or make fun of you.

211
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:44,430
Speaker 0: Alright, so I guess Scott you can start just pick one the pick one.

212
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:46,870
Speaker 1: Hey, yeah, I'm gonna start at the top of the list because it's easier.

213
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:52,830
Speaker 1: All right, your opinion on Joan and Vasquez and his works also your thoughts in the AMV hell series.

214
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,036
Speaker 1: Well, this isn't a question.

215
00:12:55,497 --> 00:13:01,535
Speaker 1: So if this were jeopardy you would have just failed because there are no question marks now For anyone doesn't know who mr.

216
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:09,714
Speaker 0: Vasquez is this is the creative genius behind invader-zim Johnny the homicidal maniac At all at alia.

217
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:10,697
Speaker 0: Yep.

218
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:18,249
Speaker 1: I enjoy invader-zim as much as I enjoy other cartoons Sort of like Rocco's modern life and rest in peace, which is pretty good.

219
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:21,928
Speaker 0: I was very much a fan of the especially the early episodes of invader-zim.

220
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:26,486
Speaker 1: Yep I didn't really see more than the early episodes and Johnny the homicidal maniac.

221
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:32,365
Speaker 1: what little of it Was moderately enjoyable But parts of it were also not enjoyable.

222
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:32,990
Speaker 1: It really depended.

223
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,226
Speaker 0: Yeah, I enjoy it partly because I've never met any.

224
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:37,070
Speaker 0: with rare exception.

225
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,688
Speaker 0: I've never met anyone who was a fan of Johnny and who wasn't and somehow cool.

226
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:47,713
Speaker 0: Yep I mean like you walked on you just just you yell squee at an anime con and almost anyone who yells squee back is A cool guy.

227
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,243
Speaker 1: Yep or a girl.

228
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:58,057
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so you don't know Vasquez not the most amazing most perfect favorite awesome guy in the world But he's not bad.

229
00:13:58,118 --> 00:13:58,983
Speaker 1: He's a good dude.

230
00:13:59,224 --> 00:13:59,787
Speaker 1: That's good stuff.

231
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:01,995
Speaker 1: AMV hell series.

232
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:05,370
Speaker 1: I had heard of the AMV hell series and never actually watched it.

233
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:11,730
Speaker 1: I watched AMV held your number one on YouTube and it wasn't so exciting.

234
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,810
Speaker 1: It was like a bunch of really short.

235
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,910
Speaker 1: It's like someone came up with a bunch of AMV ideas, but couldn't actually be bothered to make real AMVs.

236
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:32,667
Speaker 1: so they kind of made like these 10-second AMVs that just embodied the idea they came up with strung them all together and While they were comedic they weren't comedic enough to actually get me to go even ha once.

237
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:36,550
Speaker 1: so Lame I call this fan crap.

238
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:39,761
Speaker 0: I I guess things like this are a lot more fun to us.

239
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:43,216
Speaker 0: before we became jaded old men We've been to a million anime.

240
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:46,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had showed me this five years ago I would have pissed my pants.

241
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:53,029
Speaker 1: But because I've seen so much anime and so many music videos and been to so many cons This looks like fan crap to me.

242
00:14:53,331 --> 00:15:00,841
Speaker 0: So yeah, my advice to you is if you're not jaded or you don't know what this is At least go check it out once at a con because it is good.

243
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:02,850
Speaker 0: It is well executed is well done.

244
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:04,261
Speaker 0: It is just not our bag anymore.

245
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:09,662
Speaker 1: Nope doesn't doesn't Get us stirred up, but it gets the normal anime fan stirred up.

246
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:10,666
Speaker 0: All right.

247
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:13,636
Speaker 0: now there's a question I'm gonna mention but skip now.

248
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:34,449
Speaker 0: hasbro asked us in the forums about how we feel about the fact that anime cons have kind of become generic geek cons and just the whole all this stuff about anime culture and Everything and all I'd really like to say is that we answered this question in excruciating detail on Anime world order and very shortly they're going to be playing an episode where they respond to that and they'll play it.

249
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:54,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, who knows if it'll be next week or the week after but if you just listen to their show We they said some things about it two shows ago and on their most recent show and then we just responded with a flurry As we already said flurry of voice MP3s and emails and I'm sure it will come up on there, you know coming up shows

250
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:56,434
Speaker 0: we will definitely keep you appraised Okay.

251
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,310
Speaker 0: Now since I skipped one, I'm gonna actually pick a real question.

252
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:00,836
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm going right down the line.

253
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:07,689
Speaker 0: We had a question from classic bra in the forums something you wanted to ask us How important is your relationship to each other to the overall show?

254
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,384
Speaker 0: Do you think that the show was more about you guys or the things you talk about?

255
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,858
Speaker 1: I Think the show isn't about us.

256
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:29,179
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes it's about us with the geek fables type things and Sometimes it is about the things we talk about because well, you know, because we're doing lame stuff but what the show I think is really about is our Perspective on the things we talk about.

257
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,350
Speaker 1: it's us plus the things equals the show.

258
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:35,130
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess honestly, I really think we could have done geek.

259
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:43,258
Speaker 0: No We could have done a podcast about Just about any topic in the world and it would have been generally the same quality unless it was a topic We didn't know anything about.

260
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,450
Speaker 1: it would be the same flavor.

261
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:45,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get the same.

262
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:54,429
Speaker 0: You know us yelling at each other in the same jokes and most people who listen they get the informative stuff and they like our Opinions, but most people seem to listen because they think we're funny.

263
00:16:55,213 --> 00:17:04,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, we we don't intentionally try to make jokes And actually I was in the laundromat and Letterman was on last night and it was really painful to watch that.

264
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:14,635
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a laugh track and an applause track and it's so Scripted and written and he's trying to be funny and it's not funny at all At least not to me.

265
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:17,490
Speaker 0: and meanwhile the two of us when we would hang out.

266
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:24,569
Speaker 0: I mean the reason we do geek nights The reason we wanted to do this was that back at our IT Like we had our group of friends the front row crew and we were cool.

267
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:41,449
Speaker 0: But as we started meeting new people and they'd come over and visit Scott and I'd be yelling at each other or like me Scott Alex and Pete and Katsu would be yelling at each other just doing What we do normally and these people who didn't know us or who had just met us would just sit there laughing hysterically And just basically providing a laugh track to us.

268
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:45,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, it really only worked if they were geeky people though non geeky people didn't get it.

269
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,630
Speaker 1: They would just be like what the hell you talking about, but geeky people would just laugh.

270
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:58,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently our natural way of talking and way of living is hilarious to other geeks therefore Geek nights.

271
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:01,289
Speaker 0: Yep, and in terms of how important is our relationship to each other?

272
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:05,370
Speaker 0: It's we can talk about this from a bunch of the questions, but we're very good friends.

273
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:12,542
Speaker 0: I mean the front row crew as a whole all of us myself Scott Alex Katsu Pete, I don't want to list everyone but you're all out there.

274
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,150
Speaker 0: We really all consider each other blood family.

275
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:16,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, we are very close.

276
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:19,190
Speaker 1: Well, not blood family the the non blood.

277
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:24,801
Speaker 0: Well, we considered each other family But I say that many of us consider it as thick and as important as blood.

278
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:26,626
Speaker 1: the world is a filial.

279
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:26,706
Speaker 1: Yes.

280
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:31,749
Speaker 0: Yes And as I mean if we weren't friends, we couldn't do this.

281
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:35,185
Speaker 0: But at the same time Scott and I argue a lot.

282
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:40,670
Speaker 0: You have never heard us argue fully on the show because we don't want to subject you to that.

283
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:45,270
Speaker 0: Yes, the patent thing was it kept going for almost an hour after I cut it off.

284
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have no idea and it got to degenerate it to.

285
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:48,403
Speaker 0: you're stupid.

286
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:49,046
Speaker 0: No, you're stupid.

287
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:49,930
Speaker 0: You're a horrible person.

288
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:50,995
Speaker 0: I've lost all respect for you.

289
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:52,320
Speaker 1: Everything comes down to that.

290
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,184
Speaker 0: You can go to hell.

291
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:53,646
Speaker 0: Yeah.

292
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,590
Speaker 0: Well, I should just move out.

293
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck the podcast.

294
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:58,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think we never said let's move out.

295
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:05,220
Speaker 0: But we've said like I should just move away the socks or I hate you and We don't care.

296
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,401
Speaker 0: like.

297
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:06,608
Speaker 0: we've all had arguments like that.

298
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,035
Speaker 1: But it's like on South Park.

299
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:09,842
Speaker 1: the kids always make fun of each other, but they're.

300
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:11,530
Speaker 1: you know Cartman still hangs out with them.

301
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:24,170
Speaker 0: Yep, but no matter how angry we are at it well the angry isn't the word no matter how heated the argument we have is we can hit record in the middle of that and It disappears and we just do a show and you wouldn't even know that we were arguing a second earlier.

302
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:28,443
Speaker 0: Yep, like literally we've had shows was like Scott you're a pig fucker and I hate you.

303
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:30,770
Speaker 0: click it's time for things of the day.

304
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,196
Speaker 1: All right Okay.

305
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,229
Speaker 0: All right, you want to pick one?

306
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,372
Speaker 1: Let's just.

307
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:37,282
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do the next three because two of them are kind of quick.

308
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:39,390
Speaker 0: All right, you knew kremlians.

309
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:43,142
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay kremlian your thoughts on freezing time and the moral nature of it.

310
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:52,532
Speaker 1: Yes, you know the inside joke We had where I once to use freezing time as an example in an argument where I was trying to demonstrate no harm No foul.

311
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,037
Speaker 1: Yes, that's enough of that.

312
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,586
Speaker 1: All I can say to that is no harm.

313
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,015
Speaker 1: No foul the end Thane of Cod.

314
00:19:59,075 --> 00:19:59,858
Speaker 1: or here's a question.

315
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,544
Speaker 1: Where's the freakin burning wheel episode?

316
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,070
Speaker 1: I know you're not a pair of shit talkers.

317
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:07,720
Speaker 1: Thank you for you know Continuing our definition of the word shit talkers.

318
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:07,940
Speaker 0: Yep.

319
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:10,210
Speaker 0: In fact, we're very glad that you don't think we're shit talkers.

320
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,230
Speaker 1: Yes, and when our vocabulary is spread among the masses that pleases us greatly.

321
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:16,169
Speaker 1: So when is it going to happen?

322
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:26,270
Speaker 1: Well, it's gonna happen two times number one when we get Luke Crane on the horn and two when we actually play a lot More burning wheel because we honestly we like it a lot and we have the books.

323
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:29,963
Speaker 1: We haven't played it a lot as much not as nearly as much as we want to.

324
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:37,530
Speaker 1: so we need more burning wheel Experience and we need to talk with the man himself and you will get more burning wheel episode and you want to do it.

325
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,270
Speaker 0: Yes, once we get Luke Crane on the show, which he kind of said he was interested in the last time we talked to him I think that'll be one hell of an episode.

326
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,474
Speaker 1: That would be one hell of an episode.

327
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:50,090
Speaker 1: and the third question what two subject subjects should I pick for next year film in history?

328
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:56,227
Speaker 1: the Holocaust American Century the Hollywood industry Australian politics the politics of third world states?

329
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:58,675
Speaker 1: well My picks.

330
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:08,920
Speaker 1: if I was having to choose between those any two I would do the Hollywood industry because I would be able to argue with people in the class every day about the evil MPAA.

331
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,148
Speaker 1: and Maybe I would also pick.

332
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:17,103
Speaker 1: I might pick the Holocaust in case of the Holocaust denier.

333
00:21:17,163 --> 00:21:18,550
Speaker 1: That would make the class a lot of fun.

334
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't make the Holocaust just because I know so much about it.

335
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:21,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do.

336
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:30,834
Speaker 1: I also do know a lot about the Holocaust and American Century also looks good because pretty much everything interesting happened between 1900 and 2000.

337
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:34,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, they definitely don't mean between 1700 and 1800.

338
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:38,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that will leave a great deal of great class discussions to have.

339
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:44,583
Speaker 0: so in the very least Let's say this you probably don't want to take the politics of third world states.

340
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:52,950
Speaker 0: the politics of third world states are Horrible and tedious and you just you'll lose a lot of the respect you have for fellow man.

341
00:21:53,192 --> 00:22:04,643
Speaker 1: Yep, and while film in history you know that could be good because actually the one film class I ever took is one of the greatest classes ever took at RIT and I would take that class again if I could film in history.

342
00:22:04,703 --> 00:22:06,310
Speaker 1: I don't know how exciting that one sounds.

343
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,595
Speaker 1: I took fine art film art.

344
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:09,000
Speaker 1: So whatever.

345
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,308
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really hard to say do what you like.

346
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:13,780
Speaker 0: personally I'd look for something completely different from all of these.

347
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:15,770
Speaker 0: I assume you have to pick something from this list.

348
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,325
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there you go.

349
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:18,702
Speaker 1: Okay, your turn.

350
00:22:19,107 --> 00:22:23,490
Speaker 0: All right I'm gonna skip a bit because I want to get the good questions now or at least one really good question.

351
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:24,356
Speaker 0: I think it's great.

352
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,450
Speaker 0: Colin asked us again in the forums.

353
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:30,589
Speaker 0: You've been graduated from college and been in the real world for a while now.

354
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:37,250
Speaker 0: What have you had to learn during this time that you wish someone would have told you when you were younger.

355
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:46,437
Speaker 0: I think your younger listeners would greatly benefit from this topic and we actually talked about this a bit on geek speak Just a little while ago Part one.

356
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:53,310
Speaker 0: the main thing is that I have to say that These aren't things that I wish someone had told me because I already figured these things out.

357
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:55,940
Speaker 0: I went through college knowing that my grades didn't matter.

358
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,650
Speaker 0: I went through high school knowing that nothing I did mattered.

359
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:02,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't go through middle school knowing that the things didn't matter.

360
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, me either.

361
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:09,208
Speaker 1: if I see if I went back to tell myself something by late high school I had it figured out.

362
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:18,026
Speaker 1: so it would have to be me telling my early high school self or my middle or elementary school self something and Mostly it would be grades don't matter.

363
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:21,275
Speaker 1: Here's how to get ladies.

364
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:24,385
Speaker 0: don't bother going to the prom just go to a party somewhere else.

365
00:23:24,566 --> 00:23:25,810
Speaker 1: anime conventions exist.

366
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:27,497
Speaker 1: I could have been going to them a lot earlier.

367
00:23:27,517 --> 00:23:27,578
Speaker 1: Yep.

368
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,390
Speaker 1: Here's how to get anime.

369
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,629
Speaker 1: You know all that sort of stuff that I just you know.

370
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,836
Speaker 1: Get me into geekery sooner.

371
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:41,230
Speaker 1: get myself to play settlers of Catan sooner to play German board games sooner to see anime sooner.

372
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,836
Speaker 1: That's the kind of stuff that I would do.

373
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:46,510
Speaker 0: but thus we'll just make this more of a. what advice would we give to younger?

374
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:55,454
Speaker 0: People out there now and very quickly one your grades in middle school and high school to a great degree mean Absolutely, nothing.

375
00:23:55,776 --> 00:24:01,630
Speaker 1: unless you want to go to Harvard or MIT or so or Cal CMU you do not need great grades.

376
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:10,730
Speaker 0: you were much better off taking AP classes, which will save you money in college or Once you graduate high school going off and just trying to make it somewhere and don't even bother with college.

377
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:13,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I am becoming more and more a fan, you know Penn Jillette.

378
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:15,116
Speaker 1: I think you know.

379
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:22,570
Speaker 1: at first I thought he was crazy when he said no college and I'm beginning to think that maybe I used to think everyone needed to go to college or you'd be a loser.

380
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,979
Speaker 1: But now I'm beginning to think maybe you don't a lot more.

381
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:33,350
Speaker 1: if you look at the list of successful people and they you know The history of the world or important people a lot of them just didn't go to college or even high school.

382
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:37,129
Speaker 1: So you really got to think about what you want to do with your life?

383
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:43,310
Speaker 1: And if college is something that's right for you and something you want to spend four or more years of your life doing.

384
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:46,070
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean there you can get a lot out of college.

385
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,436
Speaker 0: We're not saying that you shouldn't go.

386
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:57,350
Speaker 0: I mean going to college has made our lives Wonderful mainly because the college we went to and the people we met have pretty much sealed our fate for the rest of our lives.

387
00:24:57,511 --> 00:24:59,261
Speaker 0: I mean we have the front row crew.

388
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:00,649
Speaker 0: We're big in the anime culture.

389
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:13,189
Speaker 0: we have all these things going for us because of the people we met and the things we did in college and College is an experience that Really can't be paralleled in terms of just the lifestyle and the living and the fun.

390
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:19,410
Speaker 1: But at the same time Bill Gates dropped out of college and I don't think I don't know if Steve Jobs or Wozniak even went to.

391
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:20,654
Speaker 1: I have to go check on.

392
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:23,645
Speaker 0: I guess don't go to college because you think you have to.

393
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:27,559
Speaker 0: don't go to college Because you want to get an education alone.

394
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,770
Speaker 0: if you just want an education you can teach yourself.

395
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,399
Speaker 0: You can find someone to teach you.

396
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:34,250
Speaker 0: you can go to a community college.

397
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:36,169
Speaker 1: You can get a job and learn on the job.

398
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,016
Speaker 0: You go to college to meet people.

399
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:39,621
Speaker 0: you go to college for the networking.

400
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:42,270
Speaker 0: you go to college to be social in the real world.

401
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:48,770
Speaker 1: You go to college because you want to do something that requires college like be a doctor or a dentist or something like that.

402
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:53,550
Speaker 0: If you don't know what you want to do unless you have money just coming out of your ass don't go to college.

403
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:58,036
Speaker 0: Yep, until you know what you want to do if you decide you want to be a lawyer Go to college.

404
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,322
Speaker 1: you need to go to college to be a lawyer.

405
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:01,030
Speaker 0: all right unless you're just crazy and you pass the bar.

406
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could just self-study and pass the bar all right.

407
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:06,859
Speaker 1: What are your favorite board games at each player number?

408
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,686
Speaker 1: your favorite light medium and heavy games?

409
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:09,670
Speaker 1: all right player numbers?

410
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,417
Speaker 1: What do you say to player to player it?

411
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,009
Speaker 0: There's really no good to player game.

412
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,314
Speaker 1: well I haven't found a game.

413
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:16,800
Speaker 1: That's excellent to player.

414
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,081
Speaker 1: like.

415
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:19,610
Speaker 1: there are some good two-player games and some bad ones.

416
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,497
Speaker 1: I haven't found a game.

417
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,230
Speaker 1: That's like an amazing two-player game.

418
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:22,993
Speaker 1: I love to play.

419
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:25,944
Speaker 1: I guess the only ones I can really pick would be lost.

420
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:32,162
Speaker 1: cities is kind of good and San Juan played two players, okay, I enjoy a Stratego.

421
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,466
Speaker 0: I enjoy Attica two-player.

422
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:34,590
Speaker 0: I like Stratego two-player.

423
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:36,179
Speaker 0: I really liked st.

424
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:38,110
Speaker 1: Petersburg to player until we solved it.

425
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:41,020
Speaker 0: We solved the game and also we discovered the game is broken.

426
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:49,670
Speaker 0: yep three players, Puerto Rico hands down, Puerto Rico Is one probably in my eyes the most perfect board game ever constructed yep?

427
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:54,188
Speaker 0: I can't think of any game that has even come close to the Citizen Kane of board games.

428
00:26:54,409 --> 00:27:00,584
Speaker 0: yes Not my favorite game anymore But especially the three-player version of Puerto Rico is just this perfect perfect game.

429
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:06,770
Speaker 1: most people seem to like the four and five But I think it's because we played the three players so much that we're we really like that more.

430
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:09,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, four player Tigris and Euphrates hands down.

431
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:12,870
Speaker 0: Tigris and Euphrates is just an amazing game.

432
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,538
Speaker 1: Yep, four player five player.

433
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:19,630
Speaker 0: I would say I'm on Ray, but that's just because I haven't played Calus enough.

434
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,790
Speaker 1: I think yeah, but see the thing is I would say Calus more for the six player.

435
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,553
Speaker 0: Yeah It's hard to see.

436
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:30,449
Speaker 0: it's hard to say at that point because games that have more than four tend to have many more than four.

437
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:37,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm on Ray is good five player, but there are also you know there are games that we haven't played that you know.

438
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:40,376
Speaker 1: might Trump over these things.

439
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:45,596
Speaker 0: you know it's hard to say what our favorite game is just because we like so many games And we like them all for different reasons.

440
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:48,229
Speaker 1: yep light medium and heavy games.

441
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:50,987
Speaker 1: What's light that we like?

442
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,916
Speaker 1: Carcassonne is kind of light.

443
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,509
Speaker 0: yeah, I would say it's light only because I've solved it.

444
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:59,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe that maybe Carcassonne is medium light could be Stratego.

445
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,276
Speaker 0: It's I mean it's hard.

446
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:07,034
Speaker 0: basically the way I categorize games are trivial normal and difficult As opposed to light.

447
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:09,743
Speaker 0: medium heavy yeah difficult is like Tigers and Euphrates.

448
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:11,328
Speaker 0: so Carcassonne isn't trivial.

449
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:11,810
Speaker 1: It's medium.

450
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:13,776
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't really play trivial games.

451
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:18,610
Speaker 1: No we played Timbuktu once yeah, but that's not it's not.

452
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:21,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's debatable whether it's trivial.

453
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:23,284
Speaker 1: I would say it's not trivial to everyone.

454
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:24,107
Speaker 0: It's trivial.

455
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:32,489
Speaker 0: it's something like Candyland is trivial to everyone yeah, but I would consider to a German board game or a game like Timbuktu is trivial if you're reasonably intelligent.

456
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,262
Speaker 0: Deductive yeah, yeah, yeah Okay, and you understand game theory.

457
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:38,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, heavy games.

458
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:43,183
Speaker 1: I guess if you consider Tigris and Euphrates and Kayla's heavy then there you have it.

459
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,908
Speaker 1: We like the German games.

460
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:48,309
Speaker 0: Yes Alright, I'm gonna jump around today.

461
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:50,817
Speaker 1: You guys planning any to chibi?

462
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,343
Speaker 1: usa says you guys planning any trips to Florida.

463
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:54,306
Speaker 0: Are you gonna do two now?

464
00:28:54,547 --> 00:29:04,314
Speaker 1: Yeah alright, so Yeah My grandma lives in Florida and haven't visited in a while, so I might visit her soon Maybe in the winter.

465
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,725
Speaker 0: who knows all right you did too, so I'm gonna do two all right.

466
00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:12,459
Speaker 0: I'll start off with a Rayleth in the forums asked us quote.

467
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,788
Speaker 0: What are you guys going to do when the zombies attack?

468
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:15,390
Speaker 0: and it's funny.

469
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:21,990
Speaker 1: You should ask that because we have you know how some people in their buildings or houses have a plan of fire escape.

470
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:26,002
Speaker 1: We have a plan of zombie attack for every situation that we are ever in.

471
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:33,448
Speaker 0: whenever we're bored at a convention or at Wildwood, New Jersey wherever we happen to be we just debate what we would do and it did like.

472
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:40,041
Speaker 0: well If they're fast zombies that only infect with a bite we do this But if they're slow zombies that lunge we do this.

473
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:44,679
Speaker 1: and if the zombies are they aimless zombies Or they come after you eat the brain zombies.

474
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:47,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, are they 28 days later zombies or dawn of the dead zombies?

475
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, it depends on a lot of things.

476
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,346
Speaker 1: zombies eat my neighbor zombies.

477
00:29:51,487 --> 00:29:58,630
Speaker 1: yep, and For every situation we've got a plan that usually involves motor vehicles.

478
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:00,679
Speaker 1: Different forms of transportation.

479
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:13,248
Speaker 0: trains are very good for zombie attacks guns explosives chainsaws knives Chopping malls, it's not Dan everyone says the baseball bat a good bokto will serve just as well.

480
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:15,501
Speaker 0: indeed In fact better because you can poke it through the eye.

481
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:18,229
Speaker 0: yep, but anyway We're not gonna give you all the plans.

482
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,364
Speaker 0: But suffice to say if when the zombies come we're ready.

483
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:27,470
Speaker 0: if you come out to the geek house We can probably protect you, but we probably won't be able to feed you unless you can fend for yourself.

484
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:28,579
Speaker 0: We'll just eat you.

485
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,006
Speaker 1: oh Yeah, come to the geek house in the zombie attack.

486
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:35,489
Speaker 0: Yeah Send more paramedics.

487
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,637
Speaker 1: Great I'm a vegetarian zombie.

488
00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:41,424
Speaker 1: It's an old joke great.

489
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:53,288
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do another one here Fantasos in the forums as this question and I bring this up only because this is an issue that we know quite a bit about And I'm surprised someone even noticed that we talked about this.

490
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:58,069
Speaker 0: This question has occurred to me every morning when I'm getting ready, but I keep forgetting to ask it.

491
00:30:59,554 --> 00:31:04,490
Speaker 0: While ago, I don't know one of you made a passing remark about how deodorant was good, but antiperspirant was bad.

492
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:07,450
Speaker 0: It was completely tangential, and it wasn't coming on further.

493
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:09,749
Speaker 0: What's wrong with antiperspirant?

494
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:13,061
Speaker 0: Is the only people I've ever heard talk about this?

495
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,930
Speaker 0: or crazy hippies or some sort of Randy ness?

496
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:16,759
Speaker 0: All right point the first.

497
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,128
Speaker 1: I like how he said Randy ness.

498
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:22,930
Speaker 1: yes We're spreading the vocabulary of geek nights even farther, and that was a great paraphrasing rim.

499
00:31:23,311 --> 00:31:24,255
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm proud of that.

500
00:31:24,537 --> 00:31:25,581
Speaker 0: I think I do a good job at that.

501
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,750
Speaker 0: You know what I'm Maggie with paraphrasing skills.

502
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:35,433
Speaker 1: Oh god someone else's vocabulary spreads to you, and then comes back to uh Okay, okay.

503
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:37,160
Speaker 0: now point the first.

504
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:39,630
Speaker 0: your body wants to sweat.

505
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,400
Speaker 0: There is probably a reason it is trying to sweat.

506
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,343
Speaker 1: sweating is good.

507
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:45,210
Speaker 1: It's like your natural coolant system.

508
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,130
Speaker 1: You know what happens if you take the coolant system out of a computer or your car it catches fire.

509
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:51,016
Speaker 1: You want to sweat.

510
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:53,002
Speaker 1: that is your number one coolant system.

511
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,310
Speaker 1: you need to use it if you prevent sweating.

512
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,081
Speaker 1: It's like taking the heat sink off your CPU.

513
00:31:58,241 --> 00:31:59,727
Speaker 1: very bad very very bad.

514
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:12,214
Speaker 1: now number two And this is more a cosmetic thing the vast majority of antiperspirants in the United States pretty much all the ones that work all the Ones that don't use this method are the bullshit hippie sea salt Crystal crap.

515
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:13,477
Speaker 1: that is just hippie crap.

516
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:14,641
Speaker 1: that doesn't work now.

517
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:20,460
Speaker 0: They contain one of three chemical compounds Aluminum chloride or aluminium.

518
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:31,950
Speaker 0: for those aluminium aluminium aluminium Chlorhydrate or aluminium zirconia notice the common ingredient in and all those now Aluminum is a wonderful metal.

519
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:34,437
Speaker 0: There is evidence both ways there.

520
00:32:34,457 --> 00:32:43,670
Speaker 0: there have been some tiny links between aluminum exposure in quantity and Alzheimer's disease But I'll say right now those are not in any way statistically verifiable.

521
00:32:44,272 --> 00:32:50,610
Speaker 1: The reason that antiperspirant is bad and the reason that aluminum is an ingredient is the way antiperspirant works.

522
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:55,404
Speaker 1: There are aluminum shards in the antiperspirant that clog your pores.

523
00:32:55,826 --> 00:33:02,106
Speaker 1: now if you don't mind Aluminum shards clogging your pores be my guest and use antiperspirant personally.

524
00:33:02,126 --> 00:33:08,230
Speaker 1: I don't like to You know destroy all the pores in my armpits with shards of aluminum.

525
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,253
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean quite literally.

526
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:22,470
Speaker 0: this aluminum reacts with your sweat and things in your sweat to form a jealous kind of plug in the Sweat gland that swells up and it it actually can damage the sweat glands indeed And that's what it's trying to do because it doesn't want you to perspire.

527
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:36,068
Speaker 0: Using antiperspirants too much can cause you in the end to sweat more or to get to the point where if you don't wear any Perspirant you'll sweat up more than you humanly should and it's bad or you can destroy everything so you won't sweat.

528
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:36,810
Speaker 1: that's dangerous.

529
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,790
Speaker 0: Now two About three I guess all these aluminum compounds will stain clothing.

530
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:47,930
Speaker 0: So if you have ever ruined a shirt because you got these yellow stains in the pits that is because of your antiperspirant.

531
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,546
Speaker 0: No human excretion unless you have a disease will cause that.

532
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:57,406
Speaker 0: well pee Well human excretion from the sweat gland there you go unless you have a disease or unless you didn't shower.

533
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:01,227
Speaker 0: if you've ever gotten sweat Stains that is caused by any perspirants.

534
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:06,770
Speaker 0: yep And if you have a problem with odor down there one trim the hair a little bit.

535
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:11,728
Speaker 0: Having less hair in the armpits means less surface area which means less order to shower down there.

536
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:14,103
Speaker 1: three Deodorant that isn't any perspirant.

537
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:16,717
Speaker 0: Yes, however Hippies with their crystals.

538
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,382
Speaker 0: No that doesn't work.

539
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:26,670
Speaker 1: No go to the store and There there aren't many of them, but there are brands of deodorant that are not antiperspirant.

540
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,976
Speaker 0: They're actually kind of sparse now in the u.s..

541
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:32,509
Speaker 1: Because bars yeah the ones with baking soda are good.

542
00:34:33,312 --> 00:34:38,190
Speaker 1: So we're the one I even know baking soda doesn't really get rid of I know, but they're still good.

543
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,696
Speaker 1: Well, they feel they do the function.

544
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:42,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, they feel the rising even though baking soda doesn't deodorize.

545
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,663
Speaker 0: I've actually had a problem where I if I find a deodorant.

546
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:50,420
Speaker 0: I like I will use it forever Yeah, and and then they'll cancel it four times in my life.

547
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:51,324
Speaker 0: I found a deodorant.

548
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:51,666
Speaker 0: I like.

549
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:52,248
Speaker 0: I use it.

550
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:53,252
Speaker 0: It smells nice It works.

551
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:54,217
Speaker 1: I'm on my third.

552
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:55,382
Speaker 1: I'm on my fourth variety.

553
00:34:55,422 --> 00:34:58,970
Speaker 1: if you count the one antiperspirant I used at the beginning they keep getting canceled.

554
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, I used to use antiperspirant when I was young and you know what I sweated more.

555
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:05,029
Speaker 0: So I put more antiperspirant on and then I sweated more.

556
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:09,385
Speaker 1: yep I started using ban which was just a roll on whatever.

557
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:21,530
Speaker 1: then I switched to Mitchum and then when I learned about the aluminum shards I switched to a Standard deodorant speed stick that was green and now I'm using this bluish green degree, which is actually pretty good.

558
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,957
Speaker 1: I like it all right.

559
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:25,128
Speaker 0: I want to do one more question because this one will be real short.

560
00:35:26,052 --> 00:35:30,730
Speaker 0: Amethyst home away asked us in the forums what separates you from other podcasts?

561
00:35:32,993 --> 00:35:34,229
Speaker 0: We're good we do a lot.

562
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:43,950
Speaker 0: We do a lot more Podcasting than other podcasts not to sound I guess conceited, but I think we run a much more professional shop.

563
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:53,122
Speaker 1: Other podcasts seem to really be into the whole Podcasting thing and we're just kind of doing our own thing not caring about.

564
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:58,762
Speaker 1: you know the you know the quote official Podcast community and all that stuff that's going on in there.

565
00:35:58,842 --> 00:36:00,530
Speaker 1: I just stopped paying attention to all that crap.

566
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:04,206
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean half of what we say is what we would have said to each other anyway if the mics weren't here.

567
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:06,852
Speaker 1: yep I can't.

568
00:36:06,892 --> 00:36:17,250
Speaker 0: really it's a hard question to answer any more than that yeah, especially since I really I'm real I like self promoting like when I'm talking myself up to be on a panel or I'm interviewing for a job.

569
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:21,123
Speaker 0: I really feel icky self promoting for any other purpose.

570
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:22,126
Speaker 0: Yep, okay.

571
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,370
Speaker 1: Let's see what question we got here.

572

Speaker 0: Yep.

603
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:34,969
Speaker 0: I think Scott's answer is real good So I won't bother answering because it's somewhat similar in what I would do.

604
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:39,850
Speaker 0: I can say that everyone I'm good friends with would be very well off for the rest of their lives.

605
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,348
Speaker 1: Well, duh, if I was the owner cable vision, they would be all well off.

606
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:43,830
Speaker 1: It would be great.

607
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,914
Speaker 1: No one would need to work anymore.

608
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:45,456
Speaker 0: All right.

609
00:38:45,537 --> 00:38:48,689
Speaker 0: Now here's a question that was emailed to us by Joe from New York.

610
00:38:50,071 --> 00:38:51,621
Speaker 0: Why did the two of you live together?

611
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,190
Speaker 0: rent issues close pals?

612
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,222
Speaker 0: I've been wondering about this for a while now, but I never got around to actually emailing you.

613
00:38:57,924 --> 00:38:59,609
Speaker 0: Well, there's a funny story about that.

614
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:09,990
Speaker 0: Now when we were at our IT where the front row crew which was myself and Scott Alex our friend Pete our friend katsu and then a bunch of other people that were around but all of us were the ones who?

615
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:15,445
Speaker 0: Were trying to kind of go into housing together Because at our IT they have this housing lottery and we wanted to get.

616
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:35,631
Speaker 0: it was myself Greg Alex and Scott who decided the four of us are going to get an apartment together and We got in the lottery and we were standing in line and there was a one Two-bedroom four person apartment left in all of our IT and We were up next and as we're walking in the lady walked out and she crossed it off because the people before us had taken It

617
00:39:36,253 --> 00:39:40,530
Speaker 1: and we figured that we were gonna have to suck it up and go to live in River Hole which River Knoll

618
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,375
Speaker 0: It's a hellhole.

619
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:43,104
Speaker 1: It sucks, but we were like fine.

620
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:45,127
Speaker 1: It was better than the dorm So we were gonna take it.

621
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:52,970
Speaker 0: So the four of us are walking over and then someone from across the room yells No one wants these two one-bedroom apartments in colony.

622
00:39:54,252 --> 00:39:54,996
Speaker 1: No, I think it was.

623
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:58,110
Speaker 1: we said we'll take the River Knoll and they're like, wow, no one wants these in colony.

624
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,612
Speaker 1: We're like we do.

625
00:39:59,114 --> 00:40:02,790
Speaker 0: Yep, and what they were is actually it turned out they're all of all the apartments in our IT.

626
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:17,383
Speaker 0: There are only six of these and they are the best possible apartment you can get because in terms of square footage per person and price because they're one or two occupancy and There are pretty much as large as the three and four person apartments.

627
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:19,010
Speaker 1: They're just missing one bedroom.

628
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,258
Speaker 1: They only have one bedroom instead of two.

629
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,470
Speaker 0: so the four of us are standing there and we're like, let's do this.

630
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,130
Speaker 0: We can just live right next to each other and it'll be awesome.

631
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:27,933
Speaker 0: It'll have more space.

632
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:29,879
Speaker 0: and then everyone looks everyone.

633
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,290
Speaker 0: and then Greg at the time asked the important question Who's going to live with Scott?

634
00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:40,385
Speaker 0: Everyone stood there for a minute and no one said anything.

635
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:53,661
Speaker 0: and finally I said Alright, I think I can deal with him because I'm real I'm real thick-headed thins thick-skulled when it comes to that sort of thing and History was decided in a minute.

636
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:54,947
Speaker 1: It's like a few seconds.

637
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:59,068
Speaker 1: Yeah If it had turned any other way, who knows what things would be like now?

638
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:06,550
Speaker 0: now Despite the fact that Scott and I live together all through college Effectively all of our friends lived with us because they were just in our apartment all the time.

639
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:11,370
Speaker 0: Most of the time our apartment was like the center of our of everyone's social lives.

640
00:41:11,691 --> 00:41:17,233
Speaker 0: It was indeed which was funny because it was very small Small for that.

641
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:20,184
Speaker 0: many people like we'd have 15 like like 10 people over.

642
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,970
Speaker 0: that was too much and it was just a bunch.

643
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:26,351
Speaker 0: Everyone would sit and not move because he couldn't do anything and we'd all just kind of yell and talk and it was a good Time.

644
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:28,261
Speaker 0: we have a lot of stories from that apartment we do.

645
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:28,904
Speaker 0: so.

646
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:37,236
Speaker 0: I moved away Oh for a while for six months to work for IBM in Poughkeepsie and I got a condo there and Scott just lived in the apartment by himself.

647
00:41:37,296 --> 00:41:38,079
Speaker 0: I kept paying rent.

648
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,926
Speaker 0: So technically I still had the apartment.

649
00:41:39,947 --> 00:41:40,710
Speaker 0: I left all my stuff there.

650
00:41:41,651 --> 00:41:43,064
Speaker 0: Then we all moved away for the summer.

651
00:41:43,124 --> 00:41:43,770
Speaker 0: We all moved back.

652
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,509
Speaker 0: I went back to our IT at the end of that year of our IT.

653
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,240
Speaker 0: I moved back to the mid Hudson Valley to work for IBM again.

654
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:50,303
Speaker 1: Is he graduated?

655

Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.

657
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,210
Speaker 1: I

658
00:41:52,251 --> 00:42:15,110
Speaker 0: just left our IT and I stepped down from all my positions like the anime club and I moved away to work for IBM and I eventually I lived in a whole bunch of places in the mid Hudson Valley and then Scott graduated and I eventually did graduate remotely and he went to live with his parents for a while and got a job and I was working at IBM and Eventually, I found I decided, you know, we need to get out place somewhere and I hey Scott, let's move in together.

659

661
00:42:23,252 --> 00:42:24,589

665
00:42:42,112 --> 00:42:44,041
Speaker 0: Also the fact that the whole front row crew is.

666
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:47,870
Speaker 0: we realized we were all going to graduate had decided We all need to move in together somewhere.

667
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:51,844

00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:29,569
Speaker 1: from chemical base.

681
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,663
Speaker 0: Emo is a term that appeared somewhat recently, but it's not a new concept.

682
00:43:34,884 --> 00:43:36,930
Speaker 0: teenagers have been this way since the dawn of time.

683
00:43:37,272 --> 00:43:38,498
Speaker 0: Nothing has changed there.

684
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:40,930
Speaker 0: Why is there a new word for something that has always been around?

685
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:43,316
Speaker 1: It's just some trendy bullshit.

686
00:43:43,356 --> 00:43:43,878
Speaker 1: You know what?

687
00:43:44,139 --> 00:43:47,770

Speaker 1: I don't really like their music.

689
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:50,160
Speaker 1: I don't like them.

690
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:50,943
Speaker 1: They don't bother me.

691
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:51,807
Speaker 1: I don't bother them.

692
00:43:51,948 --> 00:43:53,415
Speaker 0: It's all good I just don't.

693
00:43:53,456 --> 00:44:00,540
Speaker 0: I mean when I was in middle school people like that They were called the angst definite article angst Mm-hmm, and there's been all these terms over the years.

694
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,890
Speaker 0: and someday emo will fall away and people call them something else.

695
00:44:03,452 --> 00:44:04,818
Speaker 0: It's it's nothing special.

696
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:07,348
Speaker 0: it's not anything to even bother having an opinion about in my opinion.

697
00:44:07,509 --> 00:44:11,409
Speaker 1: Yep All right, Emma this Tomoe I asked where do babies come from women's vaginas?

698
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,461
Speaker 1: Kremlin asks, how about rim actually tell us his hidden screen names.

699
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:16,661
Speaker 1: Yeah.

700
00:44:16,681 --> 00:44:19,610
Speaker 1: Okay, stop asking inside joke questions.

701
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:20,571
Speaker 0: Yes The.

702
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:37,187
Speaker 0: the deal there very briefly is that I went by a lot of screen names over the years and a long time ago I kind of I kind of dated a girl and she made a website that was about me and It's gone now, so you couldn't find it even if you look for it and there's really no like.

703
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:41,182
Speaker 0: honestly You'd think there'd be a funny story there, but it's really not.

704
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:43,370
Speaker 0: and if I told you more details, it would be less amusing.

705
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:48,944
Speaker 1: Kremlin asks, how about what Scott's rat last relationship experience with a mysterious woman?

706
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:50,889
Speaker 1: Stop asking inside joke questions again.

707
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,469
Speaker 0: Granted that's a funny story.

708
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:59,530
Speaker 1: It's the thing about that story is the truth is pretty tame and unfunny except for when I got you.

709
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:05,483
Speaker 1: Yes, but yeah, but the The story around it that isn't true is much more interesting.

710
00:45:05,765 --> 00:45:07,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that'll wait for geek fable.

711
00:45:07,511 --> 00:45:11,950
Speaker 0: Yes, suffice to say Scott mayor may not have dated and/or slept with an international terrorist.

712
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,830
Speaker 1: I didn't but the story is that I did so that's a much better story than a reality.

713
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:28,788
Speaker 0: Though going back to Kremlin's question I'll tell you this my first handle the first name I ever used on the great white internet in God, I had like prodigy was Origins.

714
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:36,584
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, because I was sitting there and I was thinking I need a handle I'm about to go onto the internet for the first time ever.

715
00:45:36,604 --> 00:45:47,145
Speaker 0: I was really excited I was really young and I looked around the room and we had this huge book on evolution this Giant book on like evolution and evolutionary theory and it was called origins.

716
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:48,690
Speaker 0: something something something something something.

717
00:45:49,052 --> 00:45:51,609
Speaker 0: So I made that my handle and I used that for many years.

718
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:56,830
Speaker 1: My first one was taser which I stole from an old DOS game where you couldn't type a name.

719
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,924
Speaker 1: You had to pick one of the pre-made names and I always picked taser.

720
00:45:59,964 --> 00:46:01,229
Speaker 1: cuz that let you be the green guy.

721
00:46:01,912 --> 00:46:04,621
Speaker 1: So my AOL name was taser three one four six.

722
00:46:04,781 --> 00:46:07,290
Speaker 1: Oh and then eventually why three one four six?

723
00:46:07,451 --> 00:46:11,415
Speaker 1: Oh, that was the number it gave me Back in the dial-up days.

724
00:46:11,957 --> 00:46:15,349
Speaker 1: and then I played a mod on AOL called gemstone three and I got the name I use.

725
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:16,454
Speaker 1: now No one else uses it.

726
00:46:16,514 --> 00:46:17,036
Speaker 1: It's my name.

727
00:46:17,076 --> 00:46:17,899
Speaker 0: Haha a preachy.

728
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, however, it has no official pronunciation.

729
00:46:21,971 --> 00:46:24,501
Speaker 1: Our Bach asks, what size boobs do you like?

730
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,605
Speaker 1: only the female variety?

731
00:46:25,645 --> 00:46:25,926
Speaker 1: Thanks.

732
00:46:26,187 --> 00:46:26,970
Speaker 0: I like my boobs.

733
00:46:27,594 --> 00:46:29,386
Speaker 1: Okay, I think the female variety.

734
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:29,728
Speaker 1: Thanks.

735
00:46:30,694 --> 00:46:31,881
Speaker 1: So rim admits he's a female.

736
00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:33,429
Speaker 1: Um, I like.

737
00:46:34,393 --> 00:46:35,236
Speaker 1: You know the size.

738
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:38,085
Speaker 1: the gigantic boobs really are just kind of.

739
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:39,390
Speaker 1: I don't like him so much, you know.

740
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:46,110
Speaker 1: But at the same time the ultra flatness is also kind of no good, you know, I mean I do like boobs.

741
00:46:46,772 --> 00:46:51,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think my fate the best boobs for me are the ones that are they're spherical.

742
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:55,670
Speaker 1: now I know they're not naturally spherical that there's a bra that makes them look spherical.

743
00:46:56,252 --> 00:47:01,166
Speaker 1: But when there's like two perfect softballs with a tight shirt, that's good.

744
00:47:01,307 --> 00:47:01,728
Speaker 1: I like that.

745
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:07,210
Speaker 0: now to me I really I like the aesthetic of like the 1920s flapper body type.

746
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:10,742
Speaker 0: I like like small kind of close to the chest like very pert breasts.

747
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:12,850
Speaker 0: I just I really I like that.

748
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,362
Speaker 0: I like I like the whole frapper body type flapper.

749
00:47:17,165 --> 00:47:17,927
Speaker 0: I can't really.

750
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:18,690
Speaker 0: yeah flapper.

751
00:47:19,192 --> 00:47:20,476
Speaker 0: I was thinking about frapper maps.

752
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:27,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I really I can't say any more without embarrassing either Emily or people I know.

753
00:47:27,898 --> 00:47:29,527
Speaker 0: so I'm just going to leave it at that.

754
00:47:30,672 --> 00:47:33,002
Speaker 1: Ninja Ned asked as a recent high school graduate.

755
00:47:33,022 --> 00:47:35,110
Speaker 1: I was wondering what you think is the best way to prepare for college.

756
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,509
Speaker 1: You already talked about deciding if you if college is even right for you.

757
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:41,830
Speaker 1: But if you have decided college is right for you and you want to prepare.

758
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,077
Speaker 1: first You should figure out.

759
00:47:46,277 --> 00:47:55,830
Speaker 1: you should make sure you got your shit down know how to register for classes Know your way around the school meet people at the school join clubs at the school.

760
00:47:56,753 --> 00:48:01,409
Speaker 1: Make sure you don't forget any things, you know, you bring your mini fridge and all your college stuff.

761
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:07,247
Speaker 1: Make sure you call your roommate a few times before you go to college if they assigned you a dorm roommate.

762
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:22,320
Speaker 0: more importantly Because all the material stuff you'll figure out I Am fairly certain that once you get to college and meet real people and normal people you're you're going to lose touch with almost everyone you knew in high school and You should.

763
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:29,389
Speaker 0: yes There are rare exceptions where you will still be good friends with someone from your high school Once you get to college.

764
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:31,858
Speaker 0: Don't try to cling to high school.

765
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:35,689
Speaker 0: the people who try to cling to their hometown tend to have a lot of trouble with college.

766
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:39,955
Speaker 0: Yep, all right I'm gonna go with one now.

767
00:48:40,657 --> 00:48:44,669
Speaker 0: now baltimatrix has a question or a bunch of questions in a row and we'll just hit them all.

768
00:48:45,516 --> 00:48:47,652
Speaker 0: These are kind of random one.

769
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:49,437
Speaker 0: which superpower would you take?

770
00:48:49,457 --> 00:48:52,665
Speaker 0: the ability to fly or the ability to turn invisible?

771
00:48:52,805 --> 00:49:02,168
Speaker 0: and then he has a note with all the You know provides those About whether yeah, like you can't fly into space your clothes turn invisible with you that sort of thing.

772
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:04,797
Speaker 0: Yep I Would take the ability to fly.

773
00:49:04,897 --> 00:49:06,910
Speaker 0: I've been fascinated with flight my whole life.

774
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:11,770
Speaker 0: I'd love nothing more than to have some sort of genetic thing where they can inject me and I'd have giant feathered wings.

775
00:49:12,231 --> 00:49:12,934
Speaker 0: But that's just me.

776
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:16,226
Speaker 1: I would if only I had flying and invisibility.

777
00:49:16,306 --> 00:49:22,750
Speaker 1: I would all I would take invisibility but if I had my choice, I would take teleportation.

778
00:49:23,272 --> 00:49:24,978
Speaker 1: Well, it's because the flying for me.

779
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:28,210
Speaker 1: I could get the flying experience by skydiving.

780
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:35,570
Speaker 1: The flying really is about the transportation and flying isn't really any better than walking or running or driving.

781
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:38,325
Speaker 0: Yes airplanes one, you know quickly I could get to my work.

782
00:49:38,787 --> 00:49:39,270
Speaker 1: That's true.

783
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:42,123
Speaker 1: But at the same time teleportation is really what I would want.

784
00:49:42,465 --> 00:49:46,850
Speaker 1: but invisibility versus the slightly faster transportation of flying.

785
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:55,539
Speaker 1: Invisibility has all kinds of great uses sneaking into places sneaking out of places Stealing shit.

786
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,064
Speaker 1: Yeah.

787
00:49:56,306 --> 00:50:05,190
Speaker 0: All right bender Yeah See, I guess if if it was the choice between these two while I could do more with invisibility I choose flying just cuz I've been fascinated with it my whole life.

788
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:06,395
Speaker 0: I I would law.

789
00:50:06,475 --> 00:50:10,330
Speaker 0: I just couldn't imagine the feeling of just like jumping off of an embankment and flying away.

790
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:12,236
Speaker 1: We'll just go skydiving then.

791
00:50:12,678 --> 00:50:14,725
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I plan to sometime in the future.

792
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:16,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've been bungee jumping.

793
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:18,480
Speaker 0: It's amazing, but just flight I think is neat.

794
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:23,709
Speaker 0: now if I had the choice of any super ability I would want the ability to cast spells and be some sort of mage.

795
00:50:24,332 --> 00:50:25,636
Speaker 1: That's so cheating.

796
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:26,559
Speaker 1: why cuz?

797
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:30,030
Speaker 1: then you could teleport and fly and turn invisible.

798
00:50:30,211 --> 00:50:38,470
Speaker 0: I've been the ability to transform my body because then I could turn into a snake to hide but I can also grow myself wings and fly Right.

799
00:50:41,394 --> 00:50:42,358
Speaker 0: I can pick superpowers.

800
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:49,970
Speaker 0: All right, and this question I think is interesting If - if you never went into computers, what course of study would you have taken?

801
00:50:51,371 --> 00:51:00,243
Speaker 0: I personally almost I really considered going into music instead of into computing and It was really the money and the fact that RIT had a good internet connection that swayed me.

802
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:01,106
Speaker 1: Yep.

803
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:10,883
Speaker 1: I might have done something like electrical engineering or mechanical engineering or microelectronic engineering now if I.

804
00:51:10,924 --> 00:51:11,125
Speaker 0: but

805
00:51:11,205 --> 00:51:18,379
Speaker 1: I also might have done something more artsy like Writing or something or something like that

806
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:31,098
Speaker 0: if I knew then what I know now, I might have tried to go into radio If I knew then what I knew now and I could somehow have still had the RIT experience But yet gotten my education elsewhere.

807
00:51:31,118 --> 00:51:34,170
Speaker 0: I would have taken that scholarship to Oxford and I would have gotten a law degree.

808
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:39,770
Speaker 1: It does really matter and this relates to his last question if I knew early enough, I would be a race car driver.

809
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:46,545
Speaker 1: Yeah Because you would have told me when I was in like elementary school that there were go-karts I could drive and that's how to become a race car driver.

810
00:51:46,947 --> 00:51:50,406
Speaker 1: I would be Probably racing f1 right now or be close to it.

811
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:55,129
Speaker 0: Yep I mean to me the college I went to mattered more than the degree I got.

812
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:58,766
Speaker 0: So I went into computing because that was the degree that RIT offered.

813
00:51:58,806 --> 00:51:59,228
Speaker 0: that was good.

814
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:06,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, I pretty much was gonna do computer science no matter where I went but everywhere offered computer science even the state school.

815
00:52:06,772 --> 00:52:10,068
Speaker 1: So it was just you know, a matter of picking the college and RIT was the one.

816
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:12,989
Speaker 0: Yep I didn't even decide on IT until I got to RIT.

817
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,041
Speaker 1: Yeah I wasn't sure if I was gonna do IT or CS a hundred percent.

818
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:20,421
Speaker 1: as soon as I realized there were alternatives to CS I was deciding between IT and computer engineering.

819
00:52:20,662 --> 00:52:22,089
Speaker 0: Yep, which I'm glad I didn't go into.

820
00:52:22,296 --> 00:52:23,212
Speaker 0: Yeah though.

821
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:32,470
Speaker 0: actually I'm considering now getting a law degree and I've been looking at a lot of online or night classes and in that in The years to come I may become a lawyer in some fashion.

822
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:36,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, while I wouldn't want to be a lawyer, I would want to be a judge.

823
00:52:36,352 --> 00:52:43,410
Speaker 0: I want to be a lawyer as a Leaping stone into politics and into all sorts of industries that I currently don't have access.

824
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, being a judge or a detective would have been cool.

825
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:52,010
Speaker 0: Three this question is kind of mad, but if money was no object, what car would you purchase?

826
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,333
Speaker 1: well that all depends.

827
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:59,919
Speaker 1: see it depends if you're asking for a day-to-day car or a race car a tank kind of car.

828
00:52:59,939 --> 00:53:03,237
Speaker 0: if From a pure game theory perspective.

829
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:09,702
Speaker 0: I should pick an Enzo Ferrari or an f1 car sell it get the money buy the car I actually want and then have a pile of money.

830
00:53:09,782 --> 00:53:10,870
Speaker 1: Well money is no object.

831
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:13,750
Speaker 0: So yeah, but maybe money is no object only for buying a car.

832
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:15,701
Speaker 0: Maybe I could turn that yeah money and all.

833
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:24,620
Speaker 1: if I wanted to get the best car I would get a 2004 f1 Ferrari the one that Michael Schumacher drove to win the championship because that is probably the fastest best f1 Car there is?

834
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,698
Speaker 0: yeah But I say we're Fernando Alonso's current car.

835
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:34,003
Speaker 0: if we could just if we were just buying a car and money didn't really matter like we Could finance any car we wanted to make it a more reasonable question.

836
00:53:34,104 --> 00:53:35,290
Speaker 1: the car for everyday use?

837
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:42,663
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like if I could just walk out and buy a car right now the way I just went and bought that Mac I'd either buy like a z3 or a Miata.

838
00:53:43,205 --> 00:53:54,849
Speaker 1: I would either get a Nissan Skyline GTR or I would get a Ferrari the current one the 355 the one that's out now spider because it's yeah too cool.

839
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,180
Speaker 1: I was GTR man because you don't see GTRs on the road.

840
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,828
Speaker 1: They're not street-legal in the US, but god damn.

841
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,249
Speaker 0: yep I just like really little zoomy cars.

842
00:54:04,113 --> 00:54:05,859
Speaker 1: For how much wood can a woodchuck check?

843
00:54:06,261 --> 00:54:08,188
Speaker 1: it can chuck less than Chuck Norris can check.

844
00:54:08,589 --> 00:54:10,977
Speaker 0: yep My alternate answer is that's a stupid question.

845
00:54:11,077 --> 00:54:12,401
Speaker 0: You're a stupid person for asking it.

846
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:14,969
Speaker 1: five rally or f1 and why?

847
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:19,564
Speaker 1: well It's not really a matter of or it's a matter of which one right now.

848
00:54:19,765 --> 00:54:21,430
Speaker 0: I like them both for their own merits.

849
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:26,690
Speaker 0: I like f1 more now because it's more accessible to me, and it's easier to watch and I enjoy watching it a lot.

850
00:54:26,971 --> 00:54:34,580
Speaker 1: Yep, rally is more about drivers skill and crazy downhill racing But the technical stuff.

851
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,047
Speaker 1: and rally isn't that interesting.

852
00:54:36,067 --> 00:54:39,150
Speaker 1: f1 I'm really interested in the technical side of it.

853
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:44,578
Speaker 1: So it really grabs my interest and also the driver Personalities and and all that sort of thing.

854
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,604
Speaker 1: if rally was more accessible.

855
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:54,738
Speaker 1: I would watch that too But it really isn't and I don't really have time to watch another racing sport, so Yeah, all right now.

856
00:54:54,759 --> 00:55:01,690
Speaker 0: They had asked and I think this is a very good question Quoting I submit to you that real life is just like a very complex German board game.

857
00:55:02,113 --> 00:55:04,130
Speaker 0: Clearly both rim and Scott are outstanding gamers.

858
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:10,350
Speaker 0: Therefore those gaming skills should transfer to real life enabling them to acquire much power and wealth in the real life game.

859
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:16,495
Speaker 0: So the question and it's the one that plagues Mensa members ever it doesn't plague Mensa members everywhere That's the members.

860
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:18,670
Speaker 0: I have my opinions on Mensa, but that's a whole lot.

861
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,833
Speaker 1: That's another who have like that.

862
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:23,826
Speaker 0: why aren't rim and Scott rich and powerful in real life, okay?

863
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:31,320
Speaker 1: Let's start by saying Okay, you might be able to say that life is German board game But there's a problem and a German board game.

864
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:36,138
Speaker 1: everyone starts on equal footing and has the same opportunities with minimal randomness.

865
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:41,216
Speaker 0: a better way to phrase the question would be life can be viewed from the Perspective of game theory?

866
00:55:41,357 --> 00:55:44,409
Speaker 1: yes, but the thing is is that life as a game?

867
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:45,611
Speaker 1: Isn't as?

868
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:48,781
Speaker 1: even as a German board game everyone starts out on different footings.

869
00:55:48,842 --> 00:55:53,081
Speaker 1: some people might start out as the president's son some people Start out homeless in the ghetto.

870
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:54,430
Speaker 1: so there you go.

871
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:58,230
Speaker 1: We started out in the suburban America, which is sort of middle-of-the-road.

872
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,764
Speaker 1: Secondly there's a lot of randomness in life.

873
00:56:01,804 --> 00:56:02,670
Speaker 1: shit just happens.

874
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:12,130
Speaker 1: I mean I could just go down to a casino bet my entire everything I own on black on the casino and possibly double my wealth on a roulette wheel.

875
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:17,670
Speaker 1: This you know, but that's an example of sort of a game of chance in your life, but there's other chance in real life.

876
00:56:17,771 --> 00:56:19,037
Speaker 1: I mean some.

877
00:56:19,077 --> 00:56:21,570
Speaker 1: I might find a bar of gold in the backyard.

878
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:24,882
Speaker 0: You might just trip on the streets of New York City fall on a spike and die.

879
00:56:25,223 --> 00:56:27,405
Speaker 1: you might step on an electrified manhole and die.

880
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:36,210
Speaker 1: It's like imagine if you're playing a board game And there's a deck of cards and everyone draws the cards and some cards say you win some cards say you lose.

881
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:37,558
Speaker 1: They say all kinds of things.

882
00:56:37,678 --> 00:56:42,765
Speaker 1: it doesn't really matter how good you are at games If there's that much randomness as there is in the real world.

883
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:47,261
Speaker 0: now three Game theory has been plagued by this problem for as long as it's existed.

884
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:58,550
Speaker 0: and the problem is that game theory in general the the equations assume that Everyone involved is acting to one to a common goal to a similar utility.

885
00:56:58,912 --> 00:57:01,503
Speaker 0: But in the real world people have very different utility.

886
00:57:01,563 --> 00:57:03,050
Speaker 0: utility is what you want out of the game.

887
00:57:03,352 --> 00:57:04,197
Speaker 0: Some people want to be happy.

888
00:57:04,217 --> 00:57:04,901
Speaker 0: Some people want money.

889
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:05,606
Speaker 0: Some people want power.

890
00:57:05,626 --> 00:57:06,230
Speaker 0: Some people want sex.

891
00:57:06,513 --> 00:57:07,830
Speaker 0: Some people want to just take drugs and die.

892
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:08,251
Speaker 0: There's.

893
00:57:08,613 --> 00:57:13,750
Speaker 0: there's so many different things people want that everyone's playing a different game to right along these lines.

894
00:57:14,552 --> 00:57:20,070
Speaker 0: It assumes that people act rationally in order to achieve their goals and that they learn from their mistakes.

895
00:57:20,655 --> 00:57:35,274
Speaker 0: and the problem with this is that Not to disparage humankind but sociology is showed empirically that as a herd humans act against their own best interests and will often act contrary to their own goals for No reason at all.

896
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:46,969
Speaker 1: people who a lot of you will just don't know what they want and people who do know what they want Often don't know how to get it or Fail to or do know how to get it and fail to do what they know they got to do out of laziness or who?

897
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,732
Speaker 1: Knows what?

898
00:57:48,295 --> 00:57:51,570
Speaker 1: so it's really hard especially because there's some German board games.

899
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,024
Speaker 1: You can affect other players and there's someone you can't.

900
00:57:54,507 --> 00:58:00,210
Speaker 1: in life Anyone can pretty much affect anyone in almost any way depending on how well they're currently doing at the game.

901
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,630
Speaker 0: It's a game of Tigers and Euphrates where everyone has a million catastrophes.

902
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:10,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's really hard to win in a game because there are a lot of things I know I could do to get ahead right now.

903
00:58:10,471 --> 00:58:16,250
Speaker 1: But I also know that if I did those things people would throw catastrophes at me and I'd be worse off than when I started.

904
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:23,649
Speaker 0: Now also, here's our second half of the answer Which is the more this is part you actually wanted to hear because we went on about game theory and all that.

905
00:58:24,653 --> 00:58:31,142
Speaker 0: This is a life is a game Where you I mean let's consider a game like Carcassonne or Timbuktu.

906
00:58:31,744 --> 00:58:33,749
Speaker 0: if you play you could play the game optimally.

907
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, meaning no matter what's going on.

908
00:58:36,057 --> 00:58:39,749
Speaker 0: You were playing the best game you can play with the pieces you've got.

909
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:47,910
Speaker 0: despite that you might still lose because if other people have better pieces or Everyone's playing optimally and the game just comes down to chance.

910
00:58:48,331 --> 00:58:54,053
Speaker 0: You could finish a game that you lost and know that is the best I could have done in any circumstances Mm-hmm.

911
00:58:54,415 --> 00:59:03,583
Speaker 0: And secondly, we actually honestly are More rich and more powerful than the vast majority of humans have ever been.

912
00:59:03,603 --> 00:59:06,030
Speaker 0: that is that is not a conceded statement.

913
00:59:06,351 --> 00:59:12,550
Speaker 0: The vast majority of humanity throughout all of history and today has lived in utter squalor and filth compared to what we do.

914
00:59:12,951 --> 00:59:14,720
Speaker 0: We have a podcast that people listen to.

915
00:59:15,082 --> 00:59:16,810
Speaker 0: we have a six-figure income.

916
00:59:17,152 --> 00:59:18,904
Speaker 0: We live in a wonderful free country.

917
00:59:19,105 --> 00:59:20,392
Speaker 0: for the most part We.

918
00:59:20,613 --> 00:59:24,907
Speaker 0: we have luxuries that are unheard of to most people humans who have ever existed.

919
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:25,750
Speaker 1: think about this.

920
00:59:25,992 --> 00:59:30,890
Speaker 1: I can send a message and To publish it to everyone in the world.

921
00:59:31,492 --> 00:59:34,259
Speaker 1: Most people who are alive today can't do that.

922
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:37,367
Speaker 1: Do you understand how much power we have right now?

923
00:59:37,488 --> 00:59:38,290
Speaker 1: It's insane.

924
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:45,970
Speaker 1: We have more power in our little dinky house without a basement because an old lady living down there than most humans have ever had.

925
00:59:46,351 --> 00:59:57,950
Speaker 0: I mean the fact that I can right now talk to my girlfriend Emily who's in Nagoya Japan just on a whim and yet there are people in Africa who can't get a message to the neighboring village and

926
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:10,190
Speaker 1: On the same token I could go down, you know, evilly I'm not gonna say I would do this because I'd probably go to jail but you know It is possible that we have the ability to make bombs and blow lots of things up.

927
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:14,910
Speaker 1: We're not going to nor would we but there we have a lot of power to do many things.

928
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:18,005
Speaker 1: There are a lot of cards in our hands that we're not playing.

929
01:00:18,045 --> 01:00:24,730
Speaker 0: for various reasons Like for example Palestine just as an example, they have no actual military power.

930
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:29,445
Speaker 0: They have no normal conventional way to exert force upon on people.

931
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:30,910
Speaker 0: They have very little technology.

932
01:00:31,393 --> 01:00:33,005
Speaker 0: They would normally be irrelevant.

933
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:39,610
Speaker 0: However Individual determined people can very very greatly affect the world if they so choose.

934
01:00:40,172 --> 01:00:46,049
Speaker 0: I'm not agreeing with what a suicide bomber does but being a suicide bomber is a very powerful thing.

935
01:00:46,651 --> 01:00:50,499
Speaker 1: people can have a large effect on the giant game board that is the world.

936
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:59,198
Speaker 1: and You know, we just think about what we can do and we do the best we can Considering our laziness and desires

937
01:00:59,499 --> 01:01:13,120
Speaker 0: and I really think in terms of how what life has handed us and what we've done we are about we're doing as well and being as powerful and as influential and as rich as We can be without violating our own morals and ethical codes

938
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,630
Speaker 1: or without taking unnecessarily crazy risks.

939
01:01:17,272 --> 01:01:22,510
Speaker 1: I mean there are crazy risks we could take to like suddenly shoot to the top, but it's just not worth the risk.

940
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:37,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there are things I could do to be much more powerful that I just don't feel ethically okay with doing Yep, or there are things that we could do to become much more powerful But then other things would happen as a side effect that I don't want.

941
01:01:37,845 --> 01:01:39,570
Speaker 1: so I have to go about it a different way.

942
01:01:40,378 --> 01:01:50,068
Speaker 0: So to answer your question I think we are actually doing very well and we are applying game theory to our lives both consciously and unconsciously to great effect.

943
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:53,355
Speaker 1: alright What is on?

944
01:01:53,395 --> 01:01:55,585
Speaker 1: Lindsay says what aren't you guys good at?

945
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:56,610
Speaker 1: there must be something?

946
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:59,004
Speaker 0: Alright, neither one of us can draw for a shit.

947
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:00,930
Speaker 0: I can draw stick figures I can't even do that.

948
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:06,272
Speaker 1: I tried to learn to draw once with this little how to draw manga book and I kind of stopped pretty quickly because I was Terrible.

949
01:02:06,614 --> 01:02:09,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, neither one of us can sing at all can't sing.

950
01:02:10,053 --> 01:02:17,690
Speaker 0: I mean I can almost Kind of sing one Bob Seger song because he only uses like three notes and even that is pretty piss poor.

951
01:02:18,011 --> 01:02:19,375
Speaker 1: I can't really rollers.

952
01:02:19,475 --> 01:02:23,347
Speaker 1: skate rim can but I really I am kind of terrible at roller skate.

953
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:24,490
Speaker 1: I just roll the blade.

954
01:02:25,172 --> 01:02:30,470
Speaker 0: I'm a. I haven't rollerbladed recently just because there's no real good sidewalks around here, but I was a super avid rollerblader.

955
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:38,730
Speaker 0: I can't roller skate at all But I can rollerblade like you wouldn't believe and I can't really do any sort of skating or bleeding.

956
01:02:39,011 --> 01:02:41,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, though if you want to learn yeah, I could.

957
01:02:41,361 --> 01:02:44,634
Speaker 1: I've never skied so I don't know how I'm good at it But I probably won't ski.

958
01:02:44,815 --> 01:02:46,060
Speaker 0: you should skings really fun.

959
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,205
Speaker 1: No, it's super dangerous.

960
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:49,534
Speaker 0: I'll teach you it's really not hard It's not that dangerous.

961
01:02:49,735 --> 01:02:51,442
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna stay away from the super dangerous.

962
01:02:51,543 --> 01:02:52,627
Speaker 0: It's not dangerous.

963
01:02:52,728 --> 01:02:53,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

964
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:57,465
Speaker 0: It's only dangerous if you do the crazy skiing that I never really did to any great extent.

965
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:58,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not worth it.

966
01:02:59,794 --> 01:03:00,847
Speaker 1: What else aren't we good at?

967
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:04,050
Speaker 0: Well, you played the guitar a little bit, but you're not very music.

968
01:03:04,118 --> 01:03:10,350
Speaker 1: No I played guitar in fifth grade and then I played the clarinet in sixth seventh eighth and ninth grade and I haven't played music since.

969
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:17,610
Speaker 1: Like I can read music You know if I if you gave me like a music book and an instrument and within like a day I could be back to.

970
01:03:17,731 --> 01:03:24,010
Speaker 1: You know average, but I'm not super musical But I'd say I'm better than most people when it comes to music.

971
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:27,379
Speaker 0: This will sound weird and please let me finish before you yell at me.

972
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,206
Speaker 0: I'm not good at lying now.

973
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:31,630
Speaker 0: what I mean by that?

974
01:03:32,472 --> 01:03:36,645
Speaker 0: What I mean by that is that I am very good at telling stories.

975
01:03:36,906 --> 01:03:38,390
Speaker 0: I'm very good at exaggerating.

976
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:44,770
Speaker 0: I'm very good at taking an otherwise mundane event and turning it into an amazing story However, which Scott says is lying.

977
01:03:44,951 --> 01:03:55,270
Speaker 0: However, what I cannot do at all and it bothers me because I'd want to and I think I have good ideas sometimes But I just can't pull it off is I can't come up with a story from nothing.

978
01:03:55,912 --> 01:03:57,479
Speaker 0: Like if there's any grain of.

979
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:03,663
Speaker 0: if I ever tell a story no matter how outlandish it may seem There is a grain of truth in there somewhere because I need that grain of truth.

980
01:04:04,065 --> 01:04:06,735
Speaker 0: if there's no truth to it at all I just can't do it.

981
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,742
Speaker 0: I can't tell the story.

982
01:04:09,043 --> 01:04:10,107
Speaker 0: I can't make up the lie.

983
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:10,830
Speaker 0: I just can't do it.

984
01:04:11,272 --> 01:04:14,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have a lot of trouble if I try to write fiction Maybe it's cuz.

985
01:04:14,315 --> 01:04:29,330
Speaker 1: no I haven't figured out how it's done But I can't really just come up with a good story out of nothing I end up either stealing a bunch of parts of existing stories I know or writing nonfiction or who knows but I really can't write fiction very well

986
01:04:30,551 --> 01:04:31,034
Speaker 0: There are a lot of

987
01:04:31,094 --> 01:04:31,556
Speaker 1: other things.

988
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:32,541
Speaker 1: I'm not good at like.

989
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:34,250
Speaker 1: I'm not good at dentistry.

990
01:04:35,451 --> 01:04:36,956
Speaker 1: I'm not good at surgery.

991
01:04:37,036 --> 01:04:41,250
Speaker 0: Although I probably could be but I would just boggle as much as I like to play around with electronics.

992
01:04:41,672 --> 01:04:48,010
Speaker 0: I'm not that good at soldering and while I can passively solder something I often burn myself and I often make really poor joy.

993
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:57,686
Speaker 1: I don't burn myself and I can solder in a way that works, but I also make pretty poor Solders, you know big blobs instead of nice little dots.

994
01:04:58,188 --> 01:05:02,308
Speaker 1: Yeah I think if someone showed me the right method and I practiced for an hour, I'd be down.

995
01:05:02,348 --> 01:05:05,648
Speaker 1: though There are plenty other things that we're not good at.

996
01:05:06,332 --> 01:05:10,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just we're not gonna list everything in the world that we're not good at.

997
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:12,176
Speaker 1: I'm generally good at crafts and not good at arts.

998
01:05:12,196 --> 01:05:13,079
Speaker 1: It's like painting.

999
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:16,790
Speaker 1: No good putting together something or making a little tiny race car.

1000
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:17,172
Speaker 1: Very good.

1001
01:05:17,935 --> 01:05:18,116
Speaker 0: Yep.

1002
01:05:18,718 --> 01:05:18,999
Speaker 0: All right.

1003
01:05:19,281 --> 01:05:20,184
Speaker 0: Let's see what other questions.

1004
01:05:20,204 --> 01:05:20,666
Speaker 0: we're running low.

1005
01:05:20,686 --> 01:05:21,410
Speaker 0: We've done most of them.

1006
01:05:21,811 --> 01:05:28,674
Speaker 0: All right, here's an interesting one by thorn and I. we can't go into great detail on this because most of you don't care To paraphrase.

1007
01:05:28,855 --> 01:05:34,023
Speaker 0: this probably isn't a good question for the show, but it seemed a good place to ask You mentioned a few times you've been to penguin con.

1008
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:35,130
Speaker 0: when were you there?

1009
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,235
Speaker 0: Did you board game there?

1010
01:05:37,255 --> 01:05:42,418
Speaker 0: I might have met you depending on which one you went to To make an actual question.

1011
01:05:42,819 --> 01:05:44,445
Speaker 0: What do you think of penguin con?

1012
01:05:44,465 --> 01:05:46,070
Speaker 0: What do you think of these unified cons?

1013
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:47,603
Speaker 0: You know where there's more than one thing at it.

1014
01:05:47,623 --> 01:05:48,310
Speaker 0: Would you go again?

1015
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,296
Speaker 1: We went to penguin con 2.0.

1016
01:05:50,296 --> 01:05:54,690
Speaker 1: I believe the one where Neil Gaiman and Steve Jackson and who else was there?

1017
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:56,053
Speaker 0: Rob MALDA.

1018
01:05:56,174 --> 01:05:57,319
Speaker 1: Rob MALDA was there.

1019
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,329
Speaker 1: It was a cool Mozilla guy was there.

1020
01:05:59,631 --> 01:06:01,041
Speaker 0: It was an amazing amazing con.

1021
01:06:01,383 --> 01:06:08,470
Speaker 0: at least we had a lot of fun But I had a lot of fun at that and honestly we probably would have gone back every year because Novi Michigan is only about four hours from rock.

1022
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:09,253
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't see.

1023
01:06:09,314 --> 01:06:15,510
Speaker 1: I've looked at the websites for future penguin cons, but they didn't seem to have the guests line up But I still probably would have gone back in future years.

1024
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:21,430
Speaker 0: The only reason we don't go is that instead of being four hours away Novi is now nine hours away.

1025
01:06:21,972 --> 01:06:23,016
Speaker 1: That con was closer.

1026
01:06:23,076 --> 01:06:24,742
Speaker 1: We would have kept going to it, but it's not.

1027
01:06:24,863 --> 01:06:29,359
Speaker 0: in fact if jetblue flew to Detroit We might have been inclined to go but it's not.

1028
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:35,184
Speaker 0: it's actually very expensive to fly to Detroit from where we are Because not many people do so now.

1029
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:37,958
Speaker 1: in the future We might go to a penguin con.

1030
01:06:38,139 --> 01:06:39,707
Speaker 1: if you know, they turn out to be that much.

1031
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:42,709
Speaker 0: Awesome If penguin con will pay our way will be guests.

1032
01:06:43,293 --> 01:06:47,910
Speaker 1: Oh as we should send a letter to penguin con asking, you know Actually could we could kill a bunch of birds in one stone?

1033
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:51,248
Speaker 0: I could go visit my family and then we could do a show and yep.

1034
01:06:52,041 --> 01:07:02,390
Speaker 1: But yeah we will tell the story of what happened to that penguin con in a geek fables episode in the future because There are many tales from that penguin con because it was really that awesome.

1035
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:03,713
Speaker 0: All right.

1036
01:07:04,055 --> 01:07:06,607
Speaker 0: We've only got two or three more questions left here.

1037
01:07:06,628 --> 01:07:12,675
Speaker 0: Cool There's a couple more on the forums, but they came kind of late and they weren't too interesting So I just kind of skipped him.

1038
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:13,901
Speaker 1: All right, it's all you.

1039
01:07:13,921 --> 01:07:15,449
Speaker 0: All right, there's two more questions here.

1040
01:07:16,435 --> 01:07:18,650
Speaker 0: Well, this question is good because I think we can talk about it a lot.

1041
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:23,169
Speaker 0: And then I saved the best question for last because I think it's really cool that this guy listens to us.

1042
01:07:23,471 --> 01:07:29,270
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm one Balta matrix asked what do you guys do to prepare or to do a panel at cons?

1043
01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:35,435
Speaker 0: I asked because I'm thinking of doing a panel at a con in 2007.

1044
01:07:35,435 --> 01:07:42,059
Speaker 0: I will say right now that I Personally don't prepare at all for any public speaking.

1045
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,705
Speaker 0: I ever do see me.

1046
01:07:46,112 --> 01:07:55,209
Speaker 1: When I was learning public speaking in my last year of high school I learned the lesson that if I prepare it's wicked awesome And if I don't prepare it's not wicked awesome.

1047
01:07:55,735 --> 01:08:11,130
Speaker 1: But my preparations Over time have required less and less and less and after doing this podcast it really I can just write the Sparsest of notes like in two seconds and I'm good to go and even then I don't even need that most of the time.

1048
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:17,550
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, I guess I didn't go through that with the podcast just because I've done a lot of extemporaneous speaking in my life.

1049
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:19,729
Speaker 0: I mean I gave speeches in high school.

1050
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,303
Speaker 1: Well, see I always I had the speaking skill and it came out when I prepared.

1051
01:08:23,344 --> 01:08:26,161
Speaker 1: like remember when we were freshmen I ran for anime club.

1052
01:08:26,383 --> 01:08:27,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, you almost won.

1053
01:08:27,331 --> 01:08:28,536
Speaker 1: Yeah, see cuz they I had.

1054
01:08:28,555 --> 01:08:32,818
Speaker 1: I was using my public speaking skills for my last year of high school And then I hadn't.

1055
01:08:32,898 --> 01:08:33,442
Speaker 1: they gave her.

1056
01:08:33,502 --> 01:08:34,086
Speaker 1: it's like a muscle.

1057
01:08:34,145 --> 01:08:34,629
Speaker 1: I didn't flex.

1058
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean my only point is that I started earlier than you.

1059
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,719
Speaker 0: That's the only reason that I cuz I went through the same thing I used to prepare and as I did it so much.

1060
01:08:41,738 --> 01:08:47,545
Speaker 0: She's got to the point where give me literally you could come up to us like we could have a panel the anything panel.

1061
01:08:47,606 --> 01:08:55,010
Speaker 0: we could sit there and Random people could walk up and say you must do this panel on X and I think we could pull off a damn good panel.

1062
01:08:55,692 --> 01:09:10,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much no matter what X was unless it was something so complicated that we had no knowledge of whatsoever like a very specific physics topic like Super string theory something something something then we wouldn't know what to talk about but we could look it up on Wikipedia real quick.

1063
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:11,314
Speaker 0: I mean like.

1064
01:09:11,395 --> 01:09:20,693
Speaker 0: I took a lot of public speaking and communications classes at university as well And I even entered in some public speaking contests and I really didn't prepare it all Like at all.

1065
01:09:20,734 --> 01:09:25,729
Speaker 0: the most I would ever carry with me is if say I had to cite something I had to talk about something very specific.

1066
01:09:26,152 --> 01:09:30,970
Speaker 0: I might have one index card with just the name like the actual citation because I'm not gonna remember that.

1067
01:09:31,411 --> 01:09:35,383
Speaker 1: Yeah, like who said the quote or what book it's from on what page?

1068
01:09:35,764 --> 01:09:37,810
Speaker 0: but we literally will sit down at a panel.

1069
01:09:38,212 --> 01:09:40,203
Speaker 0: Well me because I got hasn't actually done a panel yet.

1070
01:09:40,224 --> 01:09:40,988
Speaker 0: This is his first one.

1071
01:09:41,712 --> 01:09:45,629
Speaker 1: But well, that's my second panel at a car at an anime kind of oh, yeah an anime con.

1072
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:49,019
Speaker 0: But I've done I've done God 15 or 20.

1073
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:50,183
Speaker 0: I just sit down and go.

1074
01:09:50,203 --> 01:09:52,488
Speaker 0: I really don't even sketch anything out at all.

1075
01:09:53,111 --> 01:09:58,190
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't recommend you do that unless you were very comfortable in your extemporaneous speaking skills.

1076
01:09:59,372 --> 01:10:02,830
Speaker 0: I don't really have any good advice as to how to prepare because I we don't.

1077
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:06,681
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright, I'll read the last question.

1078
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:08,210
Speaker 0: Alright, cuz I think I like this question.

1079
01:10:08,391 --> 01:10:11,143
Speaker 1: This is from Robert and he said I'm gonna read the whole thing.

1080
01:10:11,324 --> 01:10:12,590
Speaker 1: Alright, I love your show.

1081
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:14,356
Speaker 1: I have been listening for about five months.

1082
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:16,442
Speaker 1: That was an excellent use of semicolon by the way.

1083
01:10:17,044 --> 01:10:17,747
Speaker 0: Yes.

1084
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:18,710
Speaker 0: It is a lost art.

1085
01:10:19,492 --> 01:10:21,883
Speaker 1: I try to listen every day, but I'm not an anime fan.

1086
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:23,350
Speaker 1: I like comics but not anime.

1087
01:10:23,471 --> 01:10:25,264
Speaker 1: So some Wednesdays, I only listen to the beginning.

1088
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:25,929
Speaker 1: That's cool.

1089
01:10:26,911 --> 01:10:29,410
Speaker 1: I'm in the military and I recently was shipped overseas.

1090
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:40,790
Speaker 1: There was a time where I was not able to log on to iTunes for over three weeks in the travel here before I got My first chance to download your new episodes and 12 episodes downloaded at once and it took a very long time.

1091
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:45,049
Speaker 1: But I had to spend the next few days doing things where I'm able to keep my iPad with me.

1092
01:10:45,553 --> 01:10:47,710
Speaker 1: So I listen to all those episodes in the span of three days.

1093
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:52,390
Speaker 1: Oh, you started out with such a great semicolon and then you had what can only be called a run-on sentence.

1094
01:10:52,892 --> 01:10:55,802
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I'll forgive that because the semicolon was so well placed.

1095
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:59,756
Speaker 1: My question is something I've been wondering What is your view of the military?

1096
01:11:00,398 --> 01:11:04,130
Speaker 1: and my other question is what is y'all's favorite TV show shows?

1097
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,297
Speaker 0: Alright now one I would just like to say.

1098
01:11:06,337 --> 01:11:09,290
Speaker 0: this is a topic we could do a whole episode on our views of the military.

1099
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:16,703
Speaker 0: In the US military is in general Use of force in the world when it's justified when it isn't a recruitment.

1100
01:11:16,864 --> 01:11:17,866
Speaker 0: everything about the military.

1101
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:27,076
Speaker 1: yet to summarize as long as there are groups of people in the world who have Military forces of some sort.

1102
01:11:27,678 --> 01:11:37,167
Speaker 1: it is required for other groups even good groups to have their own defensive military forces of some sort if they wish to be secure in their persons.

1103
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:44,890
Speaker 0: and as Libertarian as I am I very much believe that there are times when force is necessary and/or justified.

1104
01:11:45,612 --> 01:12:04,370
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm not going to talk about you know many specific times when force is and is not justified but I will say this as long as your military is voluntary and as long as it is not political and As long as it is used in a justifiable way It is a good military.

1105
01:12:04,832 --> 01:12:15,910
Speaker 0: now to be more specific because I think you were thinking more along the lines of our views of the US military or the People in it and I will say that I have nothing but the utmost respect for anyone who has joined the military.

1106
01:12:16,091 --> 01:12:21,470
Speaker 0: I see it as a great way for people who don't have other opportunities to better themselves to better themselves.

1107
01:12:22,032 --> 01:12:26,390
Speaker 0: I see it as a career for people who for a great number of reasons are involved in it.

1108
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:31,644
Speaker 0: I actually know a lot of people are in the Navy and Really we have nothing but respect for you guys.

1109
01:12:31,664 --> 01:12:39,638
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I very much disagree with how the government of this country is using you guys But that is not your fault.

1110
01:12:39,859 --> 01:12:45,818
Speaker 1: Yep, and what it all comes down to is Because we've had problems with this issue before.

1111
01:12:46,621 --> 01:12:50,968
Speaker 1: if there was a draft tomorrow for the Iraq War We would run away.

1112
01:12:51,431 --> 01:12:54,621
Speaker 0: In fact, we were almost attacked by someone because we stated this fact.

1113
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:59,949
Speaker 1: if there was a draft tomorrow for World War two We wouldn't need to be drafted because he would sign up.

1114
01:13:00,713 --> 01:13:04,010
Speaker 0: Yep, that really kind of sums up how we feel about the military.

1115
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:06,420
Speaker 0: I very much believe that there are things worth fighting for.

1116
01:13:06,441 --> 01:13:08,590
Speaker 0: Yep, and I would fight for those things.

1117
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:22,827
Speaker 0: It pains me that our military which is one of the few militaries in the history of the world That has remained mostly non-political I mean so many countries have a military and then as soon as something happened

1118
01:13:22,867 --> 01:13:23,810
Speaker 1: as a military dictator

1119
01:13:24,103 --> 01:13:37,089
Speaker 0: Yep or the military intervenes in politics and the fact that the military and the people in the military Will follow orders and do what they're told to do Even if they disagree with it is in my eyes just an amazing thing

1120
01:13:37,531 --> 01:13:45,495
Speaker 1: Yep, even though sometimes I say to myself dang if those military people just you know, didn't do the things They knew were wrong.

1121
01:13:45,575 --> 01:14:00,213
Speaker 1: I mean there is a line that a military can cross, you know You violate some Geneva Conventions or anything like that, you know There is a line at which a military shouldn't just do whatever it's told but on the whole as a one single unit military.

1122
01:14:00,314 --> 01:14:08,109
Speaker 1: not you know only doing what the Rest of the government tells it to do as opposed to telling the government what it wants to do.

1123
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:17,210
Speaker 0: Yes, it's a good thing because I mean theoretically we're a democracy in America Which means that the military only acts if the people feel the need for it to act.

1124
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:25,806
Speaker 0: So theoretically the military only acts when such action is justified and thus they should always follow orders because you know That is that is what a democracy is.

1125
01:14:27,032 --> 01:14:30,110
Speaker 0: I have my views about the politics surrounding that in current America.

1126
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:35,390
Speaker 0: But all of that aside I have two examples of what I feel are problem.

1127
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,406
Speaker 0: I mean these these are two men are my heroes and I don't even remember their names.

1128
01:14:38,446 --> 01:14:40,278
Speaker 1: on the Canadian guy I'm gonna find the Canadian guy right now.

1129
01:14:40,298 --> 01:14:41,990
Speaker 0: All right, you find that I'll talk about the other guy.

1130
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:44,186
Speaker 0: I forget his name too, but maybe we'll look that up.

1131
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:46,630
Speaker 0: I believe it was in Vietnam.

1132
01:14:47,152 --> 01:15:15,222
Speaker 0: there was a group of American soldiers who were about to just massacre a bunch of civilians and There was a man in a gunboat or a gun helicopter and he saw what was about to happen and he ordered his men to train their guns from the helicopter on these American soldiers and Ordered them despite the fact that what he was doing was it was justified under a whole bunch of military Statutes and things but it was also disobeying orders from a superior.

1133
01:15:15,663 --> 01:15:22,385
Speaker 0: He ordered these men to stand down or be fired upon and He saved these people's lives and then he was then ostracized from the military.

1134
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:23,630
Speaker 0: and there's this whole story.

1135
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:24,893
Speaker 0: I think we'll do an episode on it someday.

1136
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:27,059
Speaker 0: That man is a hero as far as I'm concerned.

1137
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:36,772
Speaker 0: and There's also the case of Rwanda where the UN general who was there Scott's looking up his name Defied the orders of the UN.

1138
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:53,254
Speaker 0: the UN told him to leave to take his troops and leave Rwanda and leave these people to die and He refused the order and he was threatened and as a result him and his men Sabotage their own equipment so that they would be forced to stay in Rwanda and protect everyone they could.

1139
01:15:54,076 --> 01:15:58,029
Speaker 1: the guy's name is Lieutenant General Romeo Alain.

1140
01:15:58,089 --> 01:15:58,731
Speaker 1: Diado.

1141
01:15:58,751 --> 01:16:00,136
Speaker 1: I think it's French.

1142
01:16:00,196 --> 01:16:01,300
Speaker 1: I can't pronounce that properly.

1143
01:16:01,782 --> 01:16:05,260
Speaker 1: He's actually a Canadian senator now, and he is a living hero.

1144
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,670
Speaker 0: Yes, and I just I don't know.

1145
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,600
Speaker 0: I mean we really got on a bunch of tangents with that.

1146
01:16:10,242 --> 01:16:13,134
Speaker 0: Yes, we very much respect the military and what it does we're.

1147
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:14,600
Speaker 0: I'm very glad that it exists.

1148
01:16:14,661 --> 01:16:16,199
Speaker 0: I'm very glad that it fights for us.

1149
01:16:16,883 --> 01:16:20,280
Speaker 0: I wish it would be used in a more responsible way by the people who have the power to do so.

1150
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:26,600
Speaker 1: Yes, I my ideal military would act only defensively like it would be walking around the streets in the United States.

1151
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:41,183
Speaker 1: It would be on the coast of the United States And if anyone tried to get in and screw with us Then they would go and into action and they wouldn't be in other countries screwing around Unless there was evil there to root out such as Rwanda Darfur etc.

1152
01:16:41,204 --> 01:16:41,565
Speaker 1: Etc.

1153
01:16:41,705 --> 01:16:41,926
Speaker 0: Yes.

1154
01:16:42,448 --> 01:16:45,640
Speaker 0: I'm very I very much am a proponent of peacekeeping missions.

1155
01:16:46,081 --> 01:16:55,120
Speaker 0: I just wish they would actually be engaged properly as in send enough troops and Actually do what needs to be done to prevent people from fighting so that you can help people.

1156
01:16:55,441 --> 01:17:02,284
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean so many times UN peacekeepers are sent somewhere and they're given such terrible Orders like you were not.

1157
01:17:02,364 --> 01:17:04,470
Speaker 0: are such terrible parameters of conflict?

1158
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:11,674
Speaker 0: or what's the terms of engagement like yes protect these people But you're not allowed to fire your guns or just it's laughable.

1159
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:12,055
Speaker 1: Yep.

1160
01:17:12,477 --> 01:17:33,879
Speaker 1: And one last thing I read the Wikipedia about this guy that the hero general from Canada Diarrhea, I think Dallaire I don't know is widely known for having served as a force commander of Una Mir the ill-fated United Nations Peacekeeping force for Rwanda between 93 and 94 and we're trying to stop a war of genocide that was being waged by Hutu extremists against Tutsis and Hutu moderates.

1161
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:39,734
Speaker 1: Guy single-handedly with a very small force tried to stop a genocide.

1162
01:17:40,075 --> 01:17:41,280
Speaker 1: That's what a military is for

1163
01:17:41,762 --> 01:17:53,454
Speaker 0: Yep, and the fact that being in a military like that puts you in a position P puts people normal normal humans I mean people in the military Aren't any different from us except that a lot of them are younger in fact

1164
01:17:53,575 --> 01:17:54,940
Speaker 1: and trained in the military ways.

1165
01:17:55,182 --> 01:17:57,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean we could have joined the military.

1166
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:03,488
Speaker 0: We could have been forced to join the military by economic or whatever situations Yeah, but I mean they're people just like us.

1167
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:13,657
Speaker 0: and yet you're in a position to do such good Mm-hmm and also such bad Yep, and I just have faith that the military of this country will in the end be used only for good.

1168
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:14,420
Speaker 1: Hopefully.

1169
01:18:15,321 --> 01:18:23,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, hopefully I also have the feeling that if our military was ever used in a such an egregious way I mean the Iraq War is terrible.

1170
01:18:23,201 --> 01:18:30,943
Speaker 0: But if things got bad enough I would not only hope for but expect that members of the military would do the same things that Mr.

1171
01:18:30,963 --> 01:18:33,538
Speaker 0: Rwanda or the person from Vietnam did.

1172
01:18:34,361 --> 01:18:45,276
Speaker 0: Yep, because I really just like say all hell broke loose and the US government tried to deploy the military against US citizens Like say there was chaos in the country anarchy or an armed revolution.

1173
01:18:45,296 --> 01:18:50,800
Speaker 0: I Couldn't imagine or fathom American soldiers firing on American citizens.

1174
01:18:51,302 --> 01:18:55,599
Speaker 0: nope, and I just don't think that could ever happen because I have that much faith in our military.

1175
01:18:55,619 --> 01:19:01,056
Speaker 1: and If they did start firing on us, I don't know whose side I'd be on.

1176
01:19:01,096 --> 01:19:02,220
Speaker 1: it would depend on the revolution.

1177
01:19:03,925 --> 01:19:04,931
Speaker 1: Yeah, so yeah.

1178
01:19:05,596 --> 01:19:09,191
Speaker 1: Yeah, we asked What is y'all's favorite TV show shows?

1179
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:15,662
Speaker 0: All right, that's a real easy Futurama Family Guy Simpsons Firefly.

1180
01:19:15,883 --> 01:19:19,820
Speaker 0: yes, I don't like Firefly but like we're not gonna talk about anime just TV TV shows.

1181
01:19:20,061 --> 01:19:24,220
Speaker 1: Yep, I think the thing is that people have to know is that we don't watch television.

1182
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,409
Speaker 0: However, there are TV shows we like South Park.

1183
01:19:27,549 --> 01:19:30,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll watch them on DVD because I just can't stand the advertising.

1184
01:19:31,121 --> 01:19:32,706
Speaker 1: We have a television in our house.

1185
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:36,919
Speaker 1: There are video game systems and now a Mac Mini plugged into that television.

1186
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:41,653
Speaker 1: However, we do not get any channels via broadcast or cable.

1187
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:44,120
Speaker 1: we do not pay for that and we don't get any channels at all.

1188
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:45,740
Speaker 1: We don't watch live television.

1189
01:19:46,702 --> 01:19:52,262
Speaker 1: All the television we watch is either downloaded off the internet or DVDs Etc.

1190
01:19:52,965 --> 01:19:54,211
Speaker 1: Oh, we watch f1 races.

1191
01:19:54,773 --> 01:19:56,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, we would watch hockey games.

1192
01:19:56,661 --> 01:19:59,153
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's that show on ESPN.

1193
01:19:59,173 --> 01:20:03,755
Speaker 1: pardon the interruption that I would watch But now I just get an audio version of it on podcast for free.

1194
01:20:03,816 --> 01:20:04,258
Speaker 1: So I don't.

1195
01:20:04,579 --> 01:20:06,490
Speaker 0: yeah I would watch The Daily Show if I could just for free.

1196
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:07,475
Speaker 1: I'll watch The Daily Show.

1197
01:20:07,515 --> 01:20:08,460
Speaker 1: Maybe the Colbert Report.

1198
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:11,479
Speaker 0: You can't be a bear.

1199
01:20:12,701 --> 01:20:13,825
Speaker 1: What else would we watch?

1200
01:20:14,387 --> 01:20:15,491
Speaker 1: That's that's pretty much it.

1201
01:20:15,672 --> 01:20:18,060
Speaker 0: Well, like Battlestar Galactica, I'd probably watching.

1202
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:21,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of what I miss from television is live sports.

1203
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:23,363
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it.

1204
01:20:23,383 --> 01:20:25,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there aren't that many live sports.

1205
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:26,272
Speaker 1: I would watch.

1206
01:20:26,673 --> 01:20:28,780
Speaker 1: I would much just hockey and racing.

1207
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:33,256
Speaker 0: I would like to be watching new South Park's because I actually have a lot of respect for Trey Parker.

1208
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:34,480
Speaker 0: and what's the other guy's name?

1209
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,180
Speaker 0: That's stone and I like the show.

1210
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:37,205
Speaker 0: The show has really changed.

1211
01:20:37,225 --> 01:20:41,527
Speaker 0: for anyone who didn't who watched the first few seasons and said oh This is just kids swearing and gave it up.

1212
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:43,275
Speaker 0: I think it's a very intelligent show.

1213
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:47,119
Speaker 1: Yep Okay, any more questions?

1214
01:20:47,623 --> 01:20:48,409
Speaker 0: Actually, there's one more.

1215
01:20:48,429 --> 01:20:53,179
Speaker 0: I didn't print it because it came late But it was amethyst home away again who asked why we hate advertising so much.

1216
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,111
Speaker 0: Now well proud to be proud to be brief because the episodes been long.

1217
01:20:57,814 --> 01:21:04,754
Speaker 0: very briefly one Advertising itself is okay because people advertise things that you get the word out.

1218
01:21:05,255 --> 01:21:22,800
Speaker 0: The problem I have is that Advertising has become a business model in and of itself whereby people will give out content for free attach ads to it and somehow think that this is a viable economic model and I really don't think that it in any way can continue within the next decade.

1219
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:23,722
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

1220
01:21:23,983 --> 01:21:28,020
Speaker 0: I have a lot of reasons for that that I wouldn't really like to get into in detail here because it would take a while.

1221
01:21:29,305 --> 01:21:35,899
Speaker 1: Yeah really just the main problem I have with advertising is that it's so.

1222
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:49,460
Speaker 1: Most of it at least is not well intentioned, you know, I mean, there's nothing wrong with saying You know, even though I feel bad even doing what I would consider legitimate advertising, you know saying I have a podcast.

1223
01:21:49,562 --> 01:21:50,336
Speaker 1: Please listen to it.

1224
01:21:50,973 --> 01:22:04,131
Speaker 1: but You know when you go out there and you make you know You word things in a way in which you know that the average person will think you said this but technically you only said That and you're not actually lying.

1225
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:05,600
Speaker 1: So you can't be caught with false advertising.

1226
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:19,060
Speaker 1: But really you're lying to get people to spend money on something and instead of letting your product speak for itself It's all about marketing and brand rather than physical goods and services and just the intrusiveness of ads.

1227
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:25,272
Speaker 0: I mean advertisers do horrible things on the internet and I'll say right now I never ever ever see ads on the internet.

1228
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:26,317
Speaker 0: I block them all.

1229
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:39,399
Speaker 0: yeah I've talked to people we've known who believe that what I am doing is theft and I say to them Even if I saw the ad I would at best ignore it and at worst would note the product and vowed never to buy it.

1230
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:42,673
Speaker 1: So in fact, you're getting helped by me blocking your ads.

1231
01:22:42,733 --> 01:22:44,160
Speaker 0: case in point the x10 camera.

1232
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:45,848
Speaker 0: It's actually a really cool thing.

1233
01:22:45,869 --> 01:22:47,296
Speaker 0: It was there's.

1234
01:22:47,356 --> 01:22:48,140
Speaker 1: it was a cool thing.

1235
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:48,665
Speaker 0: It was a good.

1236
01:22:48,786 --> 01:22:53,560
Speaker 0: now logic tech makes webcams But when it came out it was this really cool piece of technology.

1237
01:22:53,961 --> 01:23:05,073
Speaker 0: But their advertising was so ubiquitous and so annoying that I even though I wanted one chose not to buy one Specifically because I dislike their advertising practices on the streets of New York.

1238
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:05,916
Speaker 1: There are those people.

1239
01:23:06,016 --> 01:23:07,220
Speaker 1: you'll see them every single day.

1240
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:14,324
Speaker 1: they hand out little pieces of paper with menus or come eat at this place or come see this show or Anything like that.

1241
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:22,456
Speaker 1: if someone's handing out a piece of paper, not only do I not take it But I look and note what the piece of paper is for and I never go there.

1242
01:23:22,636 --> 01:23:27,659
Speaker 1: wherever they're advertising I don't go because I disprove disapprove of their advertising method.

1243
01:23:29,081 --> 01:23:30,448
Speaker 0: Alright, I think that about wraps it up.

1244
01:23:30,468 --> 01:23:33,566
Speaker 1: Alright, there's actually a couple questions that just spots on the forums I want to answer.

1245
01:23:33,647 --> 01:23:34,596
Speaker 0: Alright, let's be quick about it.

1246
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,968
Speaker 1: Eson Lindsey says when are you going to do shows?

1247
01:23:38,008 --> 01:23:48,220
Speaker 1: and all the things you said you'll do a show on when we remember What we said, yeah, so if you guys remember what we said, please remind us and we'll do a show on it.

1248
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,226
Speaker 1: Well, maybe we should make a remind us thread.

1249
01:23:50,346 --> 01:23:53,236
Speaker 1: and one last question, which I think actually be interesting.

1250
01:23:53,296 --> 01:23:53,698
Speaker 1: amethyst.

1251
01:23:53,818 --> 01:23:58,553
Speaker 1: Oh my ass Which part of your body do you value the most now?

1252
01:23:59,094 --> 01:24:00,238
Speaker 0: I know what Scott's gonna say.

1253
01:24:00,259 --> 01:24:03,511
Speaker 0: No No, I know you're going to say it but then you'll say haha just kidding.

1254
01:24:03,531 --> 01:24:05,399
Speaker 0: But seriously, no now now not.

1255
01:24:06,081 --> 01:24:06,562
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

1256
01:24:07,064 --> 01:24:08,668
Speaker 0: You were gonna say the penis.

1257
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:09,430
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1258
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:11,034
Speaker 1: Well, that's the obvious funny answer.

1259
01:24:11,094 --> 01:24:12,037
Speaker 1: So the penis.

1260
01:24:12,518 --> 01:24:16,022
Speaker 0: Alright anyway It's Hard to say.

1261
01:24:16,042 --> 01:24:19,413
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't want to say my brain because I don't know if my brain matters or not.

1262
01:24:20,175 --> 01:24:25,020
Speaker 0: Um, I I'd want to say my legs because they get me around once in my eyes like spirit.

1263
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:25,843
Speaker 0: I I can't.

1264
01:24:25,883 --> 01:24:28,774
Speaker 0: there's no part of my body that I dislike except my appendix.

1265
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:33,854
Speaker 1: I Don't like says which part of your which one part do you value the most?

1266
01:24:33,955 --> 01:24:35,180
Speaker 1: not which one do you dislike?

1267
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:36,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I can't.

1268
01:24:36,308 --> 01:24:37,300
Speaker 0: I value them all equally.

1269
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:40,375
Speaker 0: I mean if I lost my sense of smell I would be devastated.

1270
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:42,703
Speaker 0: if I lost my sense of sight Equally devastated.

1271
01:24:43,224 --> 01:24:49,620
Speaker 1: see that's the thing is I don't think that if I lost smell and sight they would be equally devastating devastating both.

1272
01:24:50,461 --> 01:25:02,536
Speaker 1: But there are two parts of my body that I think are tied for first place where if I lost those it would be worse Than losing any other single part of my body and those are my eyes and my hands.

1273
01:25:03,138 --> 01:25:10,000
Speaker 0: I honestly Even though it would be a greater inconvenience to my life and it would ruin much of what I want to do with my life.

1274
01:25:10,782 --> 01:25:19,768
Speaker 0: I would I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing because I love music so much that I Probably couldn't continue living without music yet.

1275
01:25:19,888 --> 01:25:29,779
Speaker 1: I could continue living without hearing is like one like Tiny tiny fraction of a millimeter below seeing and hands on the scale.

1276
01:25:30,241 --> 01:25:34,940
Speaker 1: But I mean, you know, of course brain because without the brain I couldn't do anything at all.

1277
01:25:35,101 --> 01:25:37,040
Speaker 1: But that's you know, that's not the point of the question.

1278
01:25:37,461 --> 01:25:40,669
Speaker 0: Actually, I would I don't want to say my penis but in general

1279
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:42,213
Speaker 1: the the penis ranks

1280
01:25:42,253 --> 01:25:56,554
Speaker 0: highly it does but the the the ability the erogenous zones of my body in general that I I'm generally a very odd, I guess I feel weird using words like this, especially on a show like this, but a Sensuous kind of sexual person.

1281
01:25:56,695 --> 01:25:59,949
Speaker 0: I'm very Yeah, I think there's no delicate way to put it.

1282
01:26:00,069 --> 01:26:01,574
Speaker 0: I am a Randy dude.

1283
01:26:01,835 --> 01:26:13,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think discounting the brain I think the ranking is hands and eyes Then ears, you know mouth tongue the whole head area and then you know the arms and the legs.

1284
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:16,371
Speaker 1: I guess if you count hands don't need to put the arms with them.

1285
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:21,304
Speaker 0: I know cuz they could just graph the hand on the Shoulder.

1286
01:26:21,345 --> 01:26:23,139
Speaker 0: I guess it's bones knees and bone knees into.

1287
01:26:23,179 --> 01:26:30,198
Speaker 1: yeah Because I mean that's really as a human being the opposing thumbs and the fingers that are.

1288
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:30,600
Speaker 1: you know?

1289
01:26:31,365 --> 01:26:31,977
Speaker 1: What's the word?

1290
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:34,262
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1291
01:26:34,303 --> 01:26:34,664
Speaker 0: I'm done.

1292
01:26:34,684 --> 01:26:37,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't have anything more to say without hands.

1293
01:26:37,895 --> 01:26:43,416
Speaker 1: I really can't do anything I can't make things I can't interact with things in an efficient manner.

1294
01:26:43,436 --> 01:26:49,068
Speaker 1: you get a hook hand Yeah, but while a hook is cool I do not discount the quality of a hook.

1295
01:26:49,108 --> 01:26:55,090
Speaker 1: like if I lost one hand and got a hook I might be okay with that But losing both hands, uh-uh.

1296
01:26:55,432 --> 01:26:56,678
Speaker 1: No good two hooks doesn't cut it.

1297
01:26:57,803 --> 01:27:01,840
Speaker 1: And you know if I lost one eye maybe but two eyes not a chance.

1298
01:27:02,664 --> 01:27:03,938
Speaker 1: So there you go hands and eyes.

1299
01:27:05,362 --> 01:27:11,065
Speaker 0: All right, we've now answered all the questions except for Kremlin's inside joke questions.

1300
01:27:11,306 --> 01:27:14,155
Speaker 1: well he can take those inside joke questions and cram them up.

1301
01:27:14,215 --> 01:27:18,913
Speaker 0: his inside joke though I will say he did remind me of a story that I totally forgotten about.

1302
01:27:18,953 --> 01:27:25,200
Speaker 0: well his mom yeah The the whole spygirl thing which I will tell that story because there's a lot of funny.
