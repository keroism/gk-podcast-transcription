1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,842
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, December 6th, 2018.

2
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:13,303
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:13,905
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:15,350
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights tonight.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,529
Speaker 0: You guys love these fucking food shows, so we're talking about food we don't like.

6
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:21,550
Speaker 0: Cuz it's Thursday.

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,048
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:29,750
Speaker 0: And of course, I got a picture of Burger King up here because that's way below the line of food I will eat.

9
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:31,464
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah.

10
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,196
Speaker 0: Ski season has started up.

11
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:37,510
Speaker 0: I might go skiing this weekend, my first ski trip of the year.

12
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:38,410
Speaker 1: Good luck with that.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,770
Speaker 0: And the one cool thing is, you know, I live in New York, of course.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,390
Speaker 1: Final episode of Geek Nights, everybody.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,150
Speaker 0: And the deal with New York is that there is, in fact, pretty good skiing within a, like, a day trip of New York City.

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,750
Speaker 0: Not good skiing, not great skiing, but, like, pretty good skiing.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,976
Speaker 1: There are mountains in New York State.

18
00:00:57,538 --> 00:00:58,220
Speaker 1: It snows here.

19
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:01,050
Speaker 1: It's north enough to be cold and snowy during half the year.

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,430
Speaker 0: There are some mountains that are, like, a half hour away, but, like, there's literally no reason to go to them.

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,590
Speaker 0: Like, that'd be like going to a roller coaster park that has one roller coaster.

22
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:10,596
Speaker 0: Like, they're not.

23
00:01:10,818 --> 00:01:12,029
Speaker 0: And, like, a crappy one at that.

24
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,670
Speaker 0: But you get up north, the nearest mountains that are worth going to, there's Hunter Mountain and there's Wyndham Mountain.

25
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:20,317
Speaker 0: I've gone to Wyndham Mountain twice in my life.

26
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:23,830
Speaker 0: That place is such a garbage, like, never go to Wyndham Mountain.

27
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,582
Speaker 0: What a piece of shit mountain.

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,650
Speaker 1: But... Is the actual mountain itself bad or just the company that owns the mountain is bad?

29
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,239
Speaker 0: So the mountain itself is okay.

30
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,130
Speaker 0: It's about equivalent size to Hunter Mountain.

31
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:36,630
Speaker 0: It just has way less lift capacity, so it has way longer lines.

32
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,170
Speaker 1: So what if you bought Wyndham Mountain and, like, upgraded it and made it fancy?

33
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:41,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, except all the...

34
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,710
Speaker 1: Like turning an old bowling alley into a disco night-night bowling alley.

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:53,689
Speaker 0: So that could be possible, but basically the deal is that the investors who invest in this sector seem to have focused on Hunter Mountain, and Hunter Mountain...

36
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,350
Speaker 1: Why are people investing in mountains?

37
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,590
Speaker 0: Ski resorts make a lot of money.

38
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:59,130
Speaker 1: How much money could they possibly make?

39
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:01,069
Speaker 0: Enough money to where Hunter Mountain...

40
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:02,309
Speaker 1: Only open part of the year.

41
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:04,669
Speaker 0: Well, actually, they do stuff in the summer, too.

42
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,850
Speaker 1: Well, they're always trying to do stuff out of season.

43
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do, like, music festivals.

44
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,070
Speaker 1: They're trying to do everything they can to make money from that real estate.

45
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,210
Speaker 0: Actually, when I saw Meatloaf, it was at Pine Knob, which was the ski mountain I learned to ski on as a kid in Michigan.

46
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,450
Speaker 1: I'm sure that's his most memorable performance.

47
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,750
Speaker 1: Hey, Meatloaf, remember that time you put a concert at Pine Knob?

48
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:23,437
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

49
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:24,065
Speaker 0: what he would say is,

50
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:24,349
Speaker 0: "What?".

51
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:26,576
Speaker 0: Is he still alive?

52
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:27,764
Speaker 1: I haven't heard from him in a long time.

53
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:30,550
Speaker 0: I assume he is still performing.

54
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:31,717
Speaker 0: Let's see.

55
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:32,162
Speaker 0: Meat...

56
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,429
Speaker 1: I haven't heard from him in years.

57
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,269
Speaker 0: He's not dead.

58
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,910
Speaker 1: I haven't seen news that he's dead, so I assume that he's alive.

59
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,510
Speaker 1: But I have not heard anything about him.

60
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,110
Speaker 0: I would know if he was dead.

61
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,090
Speaker 1: Just go to his Wikipedia page.

62
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm going to his Wikipedia to see if he is active.

63
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,599
Speaker 0: Uh, year's active.

64
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,310
Speaker 0: He's still active.

65
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:50,109
Speaker 1: What is he doing?

66
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:50,928
Speaker 0: Concerts.

67
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,253
Speaker 0: Where?

68
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:53,010
Speaker 1: What was his last concert?

69
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,149
Speaker 0: I'm gonna find out right now.

70
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,309
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go to Google News.

71
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:56,849
Speaker 0: Let's see.

72
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:58,090
Speaker 1: What's his next concert?

73
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,840
Speaker 0: Meatloaf Concerts.

74
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,350
Speaker 0: Autobiography tour.

75
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:03,662
Speaker 0: Oh, that's Todd.

76
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:03,969
Speaker 0: Okay.

77
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:05,647
Speaker 0: Concerts.

78
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,526
Speaker 0: Won't sing on his new tour.

79
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:07,930
Speaker 0: Okay.

80
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,240
Speaker 0: Okay, this is an article from July of this year.

81
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,670
Speaker 1: That's recent enough.

82
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,124
Speaker 0: Yup.

83
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:16,708
Speaker 0: Uh, let's see.

84
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,330
Speaker 0: I think the tour he is doing or did recently, he is not singing.

85
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:22,369
Speaker 1: What's the point, then?

86
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:23,760
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

87
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:24,410
Speaker 0: Why indeed?

88
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:25,670
Speaker 0: I don't know.

89
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,230
Speaker 0: I will follow up.

90
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,310
Speaker 0: I will find out if it's still possible for me to see Meatloaf in concert one more time.

91
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,670
Speaker 1: Are you going to see Meatloaf play the piano?

92
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,669
Speaker 0: You see, he'll stand on stage.

93
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:37,567
Speaker 0: He'll just rev a motorcycle the entire time.

94
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:44,850
Speaker 0: But anyway, Hunter Mountain just built, like, a whole new side of the mountain.

95
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,750
Speaker 0: Like, they cut a bunch of new trails.

96
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,630
Speaker 1: They built a mountain.

97
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:53,809
Speaker 1: The elemental stone has pulled new rocks out of the ground.

98
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:58,450
Speaker 0: So, they basically, they cut new trails into the side of the mountain that they weren't using.

99
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,642
Speaker 0: And they made a whole bunch of, like, blue square trails, which in U.S.

100
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:05,130
Speaker 0: ski culture means intermediate trails.

101
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,408
Speaker 0: Meaning, the trails that normal people ski on.

102
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:18,869
Speaker 0: Which means, if I go to Hunter Mountain now, all the people who are only okay at skiing are going to be using this whole other side of the mountain with its own lift and they're going to be out of the bottom of the mountain I ski on.

103
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,150
Speaker 0: Meaning, I can ski a lot more because there's going to be way less lines to get to the hard part of the mountain.

104
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,830
Speaker 0: Meaning, it's going to be a real good time to ski there and I'm probably going to go there this weekend.

105
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:30,210
Speaker 0: And it's ski season and I'm really excited.

106
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,670
Speaker 0: So, if any of you want to ski with me at some point, I'll tweet when I'm going.

107
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,652
Speaker 1: Do not do this.

108
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:41,850
Speaker 1: Everyone who participates in any sporting event or activity with rim always gets injured every time.

109
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,090
Speaker 0: The rule is very specific.

110
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:49,810
Speaker 0: Anyone who ever rides a bike with me in Australia is definitely going to the hospital.

111
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,170
Speaker 1: I would not ski with rim either.

112
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,427
Speaker 1: You should not ski period, but definitely don't ski with rim.

113
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:54,970
Speaker 1: That's even worse.

114
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,310
Speaker 0: So, no one who has been skiing with me has ever had to go to the hospital.

115
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:13,069
Speaker 0: One person who was skiing with me busted their thumb up pretty bad once, but required aspirin and, like, a half hour to chill out and then was able to ski the rest of that day and the rest of the trip.

116
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:14,710
Speaker 1: No one who has ever stayed at home.

117
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,770
Speaker 0: That was our friend, Chris Reimer.

118
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,530
Speaker 1: No one who has ever stayed at home and played Smash Brothers this weekend has ever been out in the cold and the wet snow.

119
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:32,350
Speaker 0: I'll bet more people have died in the course of playing Smash Brothers than have hurt themselves doing a sports activity with me.

120
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,590
Speaker 1: That's because they were playing with someone with anger issues who punched them out after they cut their ass.

121
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,070
Speaker 0: Or they're just really bad at Smash Brothers.

122
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:42,289
Speaker 1: You know what to do this weekend, people.

123
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:42,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

124
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:45,030
Speaker 1: It's warm and toasty by the fire.

125
00:05:45,630 --> 00:06:02,330
Speaker 0: So anyway, the biggest news, of course, is that Tumblr has banned pornography and has implemented an algorithm to identify this pornography, and the algorithm has basically identified literally fucking everything on Tumblr except Nazis and white supremacists.

126
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:10,088
Speaker 1: I've also heard that people are just going around and reporting everything, even things that aren't reporting literally every Tumblr post to sort of mess with the...

127
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,930
Speaker 0: Yes, which is brilliant and wonderful because the system they put in place to flag posts is terrible.

128
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:19,249
Speaker 0: This is actually pretty big news.

129
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,909
Speaker 0: Like, this is a big deal.

130
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,670
Speaker 0: Tumblr just basically destroyed itself because it's not, like, there's a lot of weird angles.

131
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,030
Speaker 0: One angle is, the main reason they're doing this is they got delisted from what, like, the Apple Store?

132
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:33,288
Speaker 0: They were in trouble because...

133
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:47,090
Speaker 1: No, the main reason they did it is... The deal is even the Apple Store ties into it, but the main reason they're doing this is because they want advertising money and advertisers will... The big advertisers will not buy ads on a site with porn where their ad could be next to porn.

134
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:47,610
Speaker 0: Yep.

135
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,410
Speaker 0: And secondary to that, there is a lot of child porn on Tumblr.

136
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,510
Speaker 1: There is a lot of stuff on porn that is not good.

137
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:56,189
Speaker 0: Yep.

138
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:03,810
Speaker 0: But the problem is, Tumblr never really put in any sort of system to in any way control the content on their platform.

139
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,346
Speaker 1: Nope.

140
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:18,910
Speaker 0: So, now they're in a weird situation where they want this sweet, sweet advertiser money, and the only way to do that is to basically remove porn from their system, but this is extra complicated by the fact that it's not just porn.

141
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:34,310
Speaker 0: It's basically the things that, like, bullshit basic advertisers would consider to be harmful to their own brands, which tends to include things like non-pornographic LGBT content, or basically anything interesting.

142
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,845
Speaker 0: Like, what is their rule?

143
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,690
Speaker 1: Anything sex-related in any way.

144
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,730
Speaker 0: Yes, but also things that are not in any way sex-related, like... What do they say specifically?

145
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,830
Speaker 0: Female-appearing nipples.

146
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,690
Speaker 1: No, female-presenting nipples.

147
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,170
Speaker 1: Yes, female-presenting nipples.

148
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:57,649
Speaker 1: If the person who the nipples belong to is a female-presenting person, regardless of their actual sex or gender or whatever, then those nipples are not okay.

149
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,690
Speaker 0: Yes, even if those nipples are not presented in a sexual context.

150
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:12,790
Speaker 1: So even if there was a trans man who was presenting as male, their nipples, which are genetically female nipples originally, right, those are okay?

151
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:14,889
Speaker 1: Because they're male-presenting nipples?

152
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:16,609
Speaker 0: As long as they're male-presenting.

153
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:21,570
Speaker 0: But here's the thing, the Tumblr should not be weighing in on that kind of thing, and also...

154
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:32,250
Speaker 1: I think I've talked about it in the show before, there's a great Instagram account that's literally just photos of individual nipples, and you have no idea the sex, gender, or anything of the person the nipple belongs to.

155
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,249
Speaker 0: That's good stuff, that account.

156
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:33,969
Speaker 1: It's very good.

157
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,890
Speaker 1: That nipple could belong to anybody.

158
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:55,910
Speaker 0: But the fact that, in particular, American society and the kinds of people that these basic advertisers want to target consider a female-appearing nipple to be sexually offensive, irrespective of whether or not it's presented in a sexual context, because they just assume that female nipples are sexual in all contexts.

159
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,370
Speaker 0: And also, they flagged and have a history of flagging just anything that's LGBT-related as being sexual.

160
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:05,309
Speaker 0: Which is clearly not true.

161
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,530
Speaker 0: So Tumblr is going to disappear as a platform.

162
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:31,650
Speaker 1: The main problem is simply the same thing that upsets me always, is that there is a wealth of important historical content and information that will be destroyed, presumably, and we cannot save all of it for... It's like a Library of Alexandria situation, just like when GeoCities went down.

163
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,287
Speaker 0: I saw the beacon go up, and Twitter was like, "What will happen to all these hilarious hentai

164
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:36,649
Speaker 0: gifs?".

165
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:37,609
Speaker 1: Exactly.

166
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,155
Speaker 1: There should actually be some sort of records preservation law.

167
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:51,406
Speaker 1: that's like, "Hey, if you start some service and collect a fuck-ton of important works, you are not allowed to do this.

168
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:52,348
Speaker 1: You must preserve

169
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:52,549
Speaker 1: them.".

170
00:09:55,412 --> 00:10:02,990
Speaker 1: That might disincentivize people from creating things like Tumblr, because they will then be required to preserve those things for all time.

171
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:05,329
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, the Geek Nights forum...

172
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,349
Speaker 1: It will trap everyone who has already created a thing.

173
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,750
Speaker 0: Remember, the Geek Nights forum, the original one, is still on the internet.

174
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,989
Speaker 0: We are paying money to keep it up as long as we can.

175
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:18,390
Speaker 1: All of Geek Nights and all our forum and everything have been preserved.

176
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:30,870
Speaker 1: Even the IRC channel, which I don't think anyone uses, I had an automatic logging thing saving all the logs from it somewhere, which is why I'm sort of anti-Discord and whatnot, because I can't do that on Discord.

177
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:32,840
Speaker 1: I talked to Discord developers at PAX.

178
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:34,428
Speaker 1: They said, "No, you can't do

179
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:34,669
Speaker 1: that.".

180
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,629
Speaker 0: Yep, we actually talked to them at length about Discord.

181
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:44,649
Speaker 1: If they at that time, when I talked to them two or three years ago at PAX West, had said, "Yes, here is how to do that," we would be so Discord right now?

182
00:10:46,011 --> 00:11:00,870
Speaker 0: So, the other issue that this brings up, because we can't cover this topic, this would be a whole show if we went deep into these problems with Tumblr, but one thing it brings up is the fundamental problem of the modern internet in that nobody has a monetization model that works.

183
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:01,954
Speaker 1: I do.

184
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,150
Speaker 1: You pay me fucking money.

185
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,034
Speaker 0: Yes, pay for a site.

186
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:08,969
Speaker 0: If Tumblr costs like a dollar a month, all these problems would have been solved.

187
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,908
Speaker 0: I would probably pay the dollar.

188
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,509
Speaker 1: That's not enough money for them, though.

189
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:14,510
Speaker 1: They're so greedy, they want more.

190
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,621
Speaker 0: So, here's the problem number two.

191
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:26,110
Speaker 0: A lot of services, in particular things like Twitter, could eminently run at a modest profit indefinitely with very small subscription fees.

192
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:33,950
Speaker 0: The problem is, those platforms exist originally, because people invested money in these platforms, and they expect massive returns.

193
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:43,509
Speaker 0: And the money that these platforms could make in a traditional, sustainable business model could never satisfy the terrifying greed of the people who invested in the first place.

194
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,829
Speaker 0: The other indictment that I have about this is that at no-- Who owns Tumblr now, Verizon?

195
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:50,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like Verizon.

196
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,720
Speaker 1: Didn't Verizon buy Yahoo or something?

197
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:53,847
Speaker 1: Right?

198
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:54,270
Speaker 1: I forget.

199
00:11:54,631 --> 00:12:00,210
Speaker 0: So, white supremacist bullshit and Nazi stuff is not banned by this new policy.

200
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:00,766
Speaker 1: Nope.

201
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,950
Speaker 0: Because advertisers don't care that much about that.

202
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:09,030
Speaker 0: In fact, they probably would like their ads to be alongside that content, because that's the zeitgeist of America.

203
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:24,109
Speaker 0: So, the only benefit of this entire situation is that I think with the death of Tumblr, so too dies that particular Tumblr call-out culture, because those people will have nowhere else to go.

204
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:33,709
Speaker 0: There's no other platform that will let them have their fights about how the headcanon they made up for some particular Steven Universe character-- They could do it on Twitter.

205
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,130
Speaker 0: But those people don't tend to, and people ignore them on Twitter.

206
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:38,890
Speaker 0: Tumblr people will engage with them.

207
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,130
Speaker 0: I feel like that whole culture is going to disappear overnight, and nothing will be lost.

208
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:46,900
Speaker 1: There are some new sites, isn't there?

209
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,010
Speaker 1: Like a pillow something or something?

210
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:54,026
Speaker 0: Even Pornhub was like, "Yo, come to our platform.

211
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:54,709
Speaker 0: We will help you

212
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:54,870
Speaker 0: out.".

213
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,895
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, people don't know this.

214
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:58,590
Speaker 1: I knew this for a long time, and people were surprised by it.

215
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:06,181
Speaker 1: But the way Pornhub works is that you go there, you make an account, and you upload images, text, videos.

216
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:08,469
Speaker 1: You just upload porn of whatever medium it is.

217
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:13,870
Speaker 1: It might just be pictures of telephones, because that's your-- And then people find your porn and watch it.

218
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,770
Speaker 1: And you're supposed to have legal porn that you upload.

219
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:32,910
Speaker 1: You're either a porn company that has free samples of your legal porn with links to your actual pay site, or you're a person who makes porn at home, and you've got the right paperwork so that you don't get in trouble because you proved that it's not child porn, that sort of thing.

220
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,430
Speaker 1: You do some live streams of yourself, or your friends, or who knows.

221
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:39,137
Speaker 1: That's what it's supposed to be.

222
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,130
Speaker 1: But you can just make a Pornhub account.

223
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:47,230
Speaker 1: Even though your URL will be Pornhub, and the site will probably have porn ads on the side of it, you can just upload whatever the fuck you want.

224
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,598
Speaker 1: You can upload your webcomic on Pornhub.

225
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:50,390
Speaker 1: You can upload geek nights on Pornhub.

226
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:54,190
Speaker 1: You can livestream your video games on Pornhub.

227
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,983
Speaker 0: And more importantly, their business model is around sharing that revenue with the creators of that porn.

228
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,550
Speaker 1: Right, because they make a lot of money on Pornhub.

229
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,650
Speaker 1: They've got people signing up to pay for accounts, and they also have a lot of ads for the people who don't have accounts.

230
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,664
Speaker 1: You know, ads for porn, but there's still ads that pay money.

231
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,690
Speaker 1: They're not ads for Coca-Cola.

232
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:20,250
Speaker 1: And then they share that money with the people who make the content, just like YouTube does.

233
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,869
Speaker 0: The first basic company like Coca-Cola, who's like, "You know what?

234
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,757
Speaker 0: Just put my ads next to the porn.

235
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:27,529
Speaker 0: It's probably going to do really well in the long

236
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:27,729
Speaker 0: run.".

237
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,733
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

238
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:33,210
Speaker 1: They're so worried about doing this because of a very, very small, loud number of people.

239
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,250
Speaker 1: But it's like, okay, what's the family, whatever group?

240
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,109
Speaker 0: The Parents Television Council.

241
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:47,970
Speaker 1: So they find out that Coca-Cola is buying ads on porn on the internet, and they have a letter-writing campaign.

242
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,186
Speaker 1: It's like, "They're not going to stop drinking fucking

243
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:50,429
Speaker 1: Coca-Cola.".

244
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,052
Speaker 0: No, they're not.

245
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:55,750
Speaker 0: They're going to go to Pepsi because Pepsi's the brand that's anti-porn and pro-white supremacy.

246
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:57,589
Speaker 1: That's not how it works.

247
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,590
Speaker 1: They're still going to be drinking it, right?

248
00:15:00,153 --> 00:15:01,870
Speaker 1: You're so worried about these letter-writing campaigns.

249
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,208
Speaker 1: Companies don't have the balls to just fucking ignore it when you know how many people it is.

250
00:15:06,014 --> 00:15:07,730
Speaker 1: You know that it's just a manufactured thing.

251
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,730
Speaker 1: Why do they keep listening and obeying when a small number of people manage to organize?

252
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:17,150
Speaker 1: It's like you should understand the will of the quiet masses.

253
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,308
Speaker 1: Those are your market researches.

254
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,224
Speaker 1: You're paying all this money for market research, and you listen to a bunch of old ladies writing letters.

255
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:23,950
Speaker 1: Come on.

256
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:32,309
Speaker 0: But just this fundamental problem is that all these internet services rely on revenue streams that literally cannot work in the real world.

257
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:35,897
Speaker 0: We've solved this problem.

258
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:40,289
Speaker 0: We have not implemented any solutions to this problem, and it's only going to get worse.

259
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:53,530
Speaker 0: In some other news, I don't know how many of you are paying attention to what happened in France, but the barricades went up, and there were giant riots and fires and pitched battles and bullshit.

260
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,530
Speaker 1: Are you sure you're not reading a 200-year-old news article?

261
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:11,529
Speaker 0: I've been to Paris a couple of times, and all I want to say is that we don't think a lot about how Parisians interact with their government, but the barricades come up more often than you realize.

262
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:20,330
Speaker 0: Let's go read about the history of Paris, and you have this vision of Jean Valjean and all this nonsense.

263
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,637
Speaker 1: No, that's their go-to move.

264
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,410
Speaker 1: It's not a dramatization.

265
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:26,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, that still happens today, and this was another one of those.

266
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:30,746
Speaker 0: You can read these articles because, gig nights, we were not news.

267
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:31,510
Speaker 0: We were commentary.

268
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:53,547
Speaker 0: I hope you already know this was happening, and I'm not going to explain the details of who the yellow vests are, but the reason this news is interesting is that the way right-wing media is trying to spin this is that the common people of Paris rose up against this ridiculous environmental legislation because they have practical ideas about the economy.

269
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:54,030
Speaker 0: No.

270
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,053
Speaker 0: But that's not what happened.

271
00:16:55,354 --> 00:17:12,810
Speaker 0: The problem is, these kinds of laws, like these fuel taxes, or like in New York City, like right now, once again, we can't afford to pay for our subway because of conservatives upstate, so we're forced to once again raise prices on MetroCards to pay for the subway.

272
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:22,910
Speaker 0: The problem is, if you tax the users of systems like the normal people, those people are the ones least equipped to pay, and you don't actually solve the problem.

273
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,069
Speaker 0: You're putting the cost of solving a global problem on your poorest citizens.

274
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:34,749
Speaker 1: You should tax the car people to pay for the train to disincentivize people from driving a car, and make them want to take a free train.

275
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,670
Speaker 0: You should tax the rich people to subsidize the train so the poor people who have cars will naturally migrate to the mass transit.

276
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,450
Speaker 0: You tax the people who are causing the problem, and the people who are causing the problem are always the companies and the rich people.

277
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:49,237
Speaker 0: Not even the people driving the cars.

278
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:57,570
Speaker 0: The people driving the cars are doing so because they are incentivized to do so by a massive system of subsidies paid for by the rich people who have a vested interest in keeping this going.

279
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,530
Speaker 0: Anyway, read this news article and internalize it, and if anyone tries to tell you that, well, two things.

280
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:11,870
Speaker 0: One, if anyone tries to tell you that these people were fighting against environmental regulation, they are lying to you and they probably read bad sites.

281
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:22,129
Speaker 0: And two, I feel like the US could learn from this, and I feel like if the left in the US would throw up the barricades a little more often, we might make some more progress in our government.

282
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:30,430
Speaker 1: The problem is that historically speaking, there are some countries, like France or South Korea, where protest has been effective.

283
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,790
Speaker 1: South Koreans, in the late 80s, they were still a military dictatorship and then they fixed it.

284
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:37,790
Speaker 0: Mostly.

285
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:40,835
Speaker 1: They vote now, right?

286
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:48,250
Speaker 1: But it's like they've been voting less long than I've been alive, but they got their vote by protesting.

287
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,290
Speaker 1: They had student protests and they actually were able to change their government with student protests.

288
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:58,430
Speaker 1: In France, they also have been able to change their government with more violent protests and revolutions.

289
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:07,970
Speaker 1: In the United States, protest, while it has been totally cool and happened many times, it has not been nearly as effective.

290
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:08,752
Speaker 0: Here's an example.

291
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:17,510
Speaker 0: Occupy Wall Street didn't have an endgame that was achievable and specific, nor did it actually cause enough problems for people to be forced to deal with it.

292
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:24,170
Speaker 0: The yellow vest thing got to fucking shut down Paris, so the government had to do something.

293
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:27,290
Speaker 0: Occupy Wall Street should have shut down Wall Street.

294
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:35,010
Speaker 1: There have rarely, very rarely, has the US government or even more local governments responded directly to protests.

295
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,510
Speaker 1: Usually, they quell the protests and then they continue with business as usual after things quiet down.

296
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,123
Speaker 0: So all I'm saying is, if you didn't really...

297
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,370
Speaker 1: That is why we don't have a culture of protesting more, because when it works, then people keep doing it.

298
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,590
Speaker 1: In places around the world where it works, people do it and it keeps working and they have a culture of doing it.

299
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,630
Speaker 1: In the United States, we keep trying it and it's not as effective, therefore we don't do it more.

300
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,968
Speaker 0: So all I'm saying is, don't just remember, "Oh yeah, something happened in

301
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:03,249
Speaker 0: Paris.".

302
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:10,670
Speaker 0: Actually read a news article about this and think about what is different in that situation from what's going on here, and make decisions accordingly.

303
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:17,230
Speaker 0: These protests are a big deal and a lot of people are trying to spin them in ways that are not accurate to the real situation.

304
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:25,450
Speaker 0: Last and not least, my favorite people, the Satanic Church, are with the Satanic Temple.

305
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,730
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of different Satanists.

306
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,749
Speaker 1: The best of all temples.

307
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,782
Speaker 0: The Satanic Temple is a pretty cool organization.

308
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:30,669
Speaker 0: Seriously.

309
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:34,069
Speaker 1: There's a lot of different kinds of Satanists, but these are the good ones.

310
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:42,290
Speaker 0: Yes, but they've been winning a lot of fights lately around putting up their satanic... Basically, satanic nativity scenes.

311
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:50,610
Speaker 1: Listen, if you're going to invest in that badass fucking statue of Baphomet or whatever, you better get some fucking use out of it and they sure as hell are, or you're not just going to keep that shit in a garage somewhere.

312
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,441
Speaker 1: You've got to let the world see it.

313
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,470
Speaker 1: Let us behold its glory.

314
00:20:55,691 --> 00:21:04,648
Speaker 0: The Satanic Temple is an example of very effective forms of protest because they're actually... It's working, because here's what they do.

315
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:10,410
Speaker 0: Someone puts up a Christian religious thing somewhere in a public space.

316
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,865
Speaker 1: Like usually a manger.

317
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a manger in a town square.

318
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:14,348
Speaker 0: Or the baby Jesus.

319
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,626
Speaker 0: No, I'm an atheist, but that's fine.

320
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:17,150
Speaker 0: I don't care.

321
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:26,569
Speaker 0: I'm happy that people can express their religion in a public space, but any religion has to be able to do that, but in most places, only Christians end up doing it.

322
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:31,086
Speaker 0: So the Satanic Temple will show up and say, "We want to put Satan there next to the baby

323
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:31,449
Speaker 0: Jesus.".

324
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:31,883
Speaker 1: That's right.

325
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,788
Speaker 1: "I want to put my menorah next to the baby

326
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:34,970
Speaker 1: Jesus.".

327
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,550
Speaker 0: It's very difficult for them to lose any lawsuit around this because of the First Amendment.

328
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,270
Speaker 0: So as a result, the places that only have Christian stuff have basically two options.

329
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:52,030
Speaker 0: They either have to let the Satanists put up their thing, or they have to let nobody put up anything religious.

330
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:53,990
Speaker 1: Those are the only two legal options.

331
00:21:54,270 --> 00:22:00,229
Speaker 1: This is like, you know, unless you get some crazy Christian judge somewhere, but then you just appeal to the next judge.

332
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:05,150
Speaker 0: Even a ruined Supreme Court has a hard time shutting this down.

333
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,167
Speaker 1: They're like, "No, the Supreme Court won't even hear that

334
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:07,389
Speaker 1: case.".

335
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:16,222
Speaker 1: They'll be like, "Yeah, unless for some reason there's a crazy judge in the second-to-last appellate court or whatever that messed it up and was a crazy

336
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:16,586
Speaker 1: Christian.".

337
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:27,890
Speaker 0: So basically, either all the religion in public spaces gets removed, or religious freedom actually happens, and any religion gets to show up.

338
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,798
Speaker 0: Those are both wins.

339
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:29,930
Speaker 1: Either one works.

340
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, either no more mangers.

341
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,988
Speaker 1: Sorry, you Christian people who are so mad about it, but you're all mad now.

342
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:36,170
Speaker 1: You can have your manger.

343
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,549
Speaker 1: We can laugh at you being mad.

344
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,430
Speaker 1: Or we get to put our badass Satan right there in the town square.

345
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:54,970
Speaker 0: So to tie this into the previous news, activism, where either outcome in court gets the actual goal to move forward, is the best kind of activism.

346
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,370
Speaker 0: The Satanic Temple isn't just funny and clever.

347
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,090
Speaker 0: It is very effective in the area in which it is working.

348
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,330
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is that in the United States, going in the street and yelling has not been as effective as it has been in other places.

349
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, but meanwhile, putting up statues of Baphomet has been pretty effective in the narrow realm.

350
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,370
Speaker 1: Are there any other countries where people put up statues of Baphomet?

351
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:16,630
Speaker 1: No, because we're the only one with freedom of speech in our Constitution.

352
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're also the only one...

353
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,569
Speaker 1: Not the absolute only one, but we're the only people who have it.

354
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:20,649
Speaker 1: so...

355
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:35,299
Speaker 0: Well, also we have a particular issue with Christian hegemony and there's a whole other thing that we don't have time to talk about because it's time for... Things of the Day!

356
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,820
Speaker 0: So you know when you see a picture of an old-timey boxer, they're always holding their hands up in this ridiculous position.

357
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, one fist forward with the other one behind it.

358
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:46,837
Speaker 0: Yep, and their fists are up and they're like, "Fists of

359
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:47,100
Speaker 0: cuffs!"

360
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,948
Speaker 0: and "They've got a handlebar

361
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:48,452
Speaker 0: mustache!"

362
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,199
Speaker 0: and that kind of thing.

363
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:52,164
Speaker 0: So here's a ten minute long video... Too long.

364
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:53,499
Speaker 1: Just explain it to me in two sentences.

365
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:57,540
Speaker 0: It's actually complicated enough that it warrants a ten minute video.

366
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,400
Speaker 0: It is way more complicated than I thought as to why they did it that way.

367
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,059
Speaker 1: I'll make a saved you a click for it.

368
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:16,519
Speaker 0: So the best way I can describe it is that this was the fighting stance during that era of boxing, but the reason that was effective is that Nobody wore gloves.

369
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:25,599
Speaker 0: So while you could technically punch someone as hard as you could in the face, you would probably break your hand permanently in the course of doing so.

370
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:31,360
Speaker 0: So as a result, boxers wouldn't do it because they would win the fight and lose the career.

371
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,167
Speaker 0: Like, they'd be over.

372
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,439
Speaker 0: They'd ruin their hand.

373
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:38,300
Speaker 0: So if they hit someone in the head, they couldn't hit them as hard as they could punch.

374
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:40,800
Speaker 0: So head hits weren't actually that effective.

375
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,800
Speaker 1: You could punch them straight in the front of the face.

376
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:44,139
Speaker 0: Even then, that's tough.

377
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:50,160
Speaker 0: Two, the style of fighting back then also allowed grappling.

378
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:58,138
Speaker 0: So if you just tucked in like this, the other guy could get way closer to you than you were comfortable with and potentially grab you.

379
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,620
Speaker 0: So you had to have the one hand out to keep them at bay with little jabs and protect yourself and counter punch, and the one hand back.

380
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:11,959
Speaker 0: So if they come in and you get in the right situation, you can do a full punch to the gut and that other hand otherwise is protecting the gut.

381
00:25:12,684 --> 00:25:15,640
Speaker 0: But there's actually more to this story than just that.

382
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,840
Speaker 0: This video is worth watching.

383
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,339
Speaker 0: So anyway, now if you watch the video, you will know why boxers stand like this.

384
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,700
Speaker 0: And also, I just really like the aesthetic of people standing like this.

385
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:26,520
Speaker 0: I think it's hilarious.

386
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:28,139
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

387
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,680
Speaker 1: So here's some people, and in their bathroom, they've got a rat in the bathroom.

388
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,299
Speaker 1: And they want to get the rat out of the house.

389
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,440
Speaker 0: But they don't want to kill the rat.

390
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:45,900
Speaker 1: It seems like they don't want to use any of the methods I'm already aware of, not even the humane ones, such as the trap or the bowl full of oil or any of these other things.

391
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,706
Speaker 0: They don't want to hurt the rat.

392
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:48,340
Speaker 0: They just want the rat to be out of their apartment.

393
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,359
Speaker 1: They came up with a new way to get rid of the rat.

394
00:25:50,680 --> 00:26:00,580
Speaker 1: And what's most interesting about this video is not only is it a great video of how they get the rat out of the bathroom and out of the house, it was posted in Sports Reddit appropriately.

395
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,900
Speaker 1: Don't worry, the rat is not harmed other than being thrown out of his nice bathroom home and onto the outside.

396
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:12,200
Speaker 0: Yep, he bounces down the stairs a little bit, but he's clearly fine and just angry at the bottom.

397
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:14,980
Speaker 1: The rat, I mean, if you're just a little rat, you're fine going down the stairs.

398
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,260
Speaker 1: You're not a Scot falling down the stairs.

399
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, if a river or a Scot fell down those stairs, we would be dead.

400
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, a rat can go down those stairs no problem.

401
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,817
Speaker 0: The rat's just like, "Son of a

402
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:22,940
Speaker 0: bitch.".

403
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,214
Speaker 1: He's just like, "Ah, I want to go back to the bathroom.

404
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,118
Speaker 1: I was happy in

405
00:26:27,138 --> 00:26:27,259
Speaker 1: there.".

406
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:30,860
Speaker 0: This is a gift that is, in effect, a team sport.

407
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:31,292
Speaker 0: Yeah.

408
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:41,160
Speaker 0: In the Metamoment, the Keaton House Book Club book, which we've been busy but will read soon, is 2001 A Space Odyssey, following out from Emily Wilson's translation of A Hameric Odyssey.

409
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:47,359
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we were just at the Penny Arcade Expo, PAX Unplugged.

410
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,000
Speaker 1: The unplugged version where it was no video games allowed.

411
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Speaker 0: Where we did not one.

412
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,037
Speaker 1: Except for the illicit board games on SNES in the classic cardboard room.

413
00:26:56,218 --> 00:26:56,680
Speaker 1: Don't tell anyone.

414
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,995
Speaker 0: I saw people playing there, like all PAX.

415
00:26:59,015 --> 00:26:59,699
Speaker 0: That looked real fun.

416
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:00,726
Speaker 1: Why not?

417
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:02,520
Speaker 1: We played Wheel of Fortune and Family Feud a lot.

418
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:04,920
Speaker 0: I feel like we should stream some Family Feud maybe over the holidays.

419
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,334
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

420
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,555
Speaker 0: I'll set that up.

421
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:06,820
Speaker 0: Anyway.

422
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:08,619
Speaker 1: Are you working between Christmas and New Year's?

423
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,041
Speaker 0: Yes.

424
00:27:09,805 --> 00:27:12,178
Speaker 0: I've earned all my fucking vacation days.

425
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:12,580
Speaker 1: I have nothing.

426
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:18,100
Speaker 1: I have had two jobs in a row where everyone gets off between Christmas and New Year, and RIM has had zero jobs.

427
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:22,234
Speaker 0: Dude, when they announced that Wednesday was going to be a holiday because of George H.W.

428
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:30,053
Speaker 0: Bush's death and funeral and everything, I got an email within an hour that basically said, "Yeah, wall markets are closed.

429
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:31,136
Speaker 0: We are not.

430
00:27:31,356 --> 00:27:32,559
Speaker 0: Everyone still has to come to

431
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:32,780
Speaker 0: work.".

432
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,318
Speaker 0: That's right.

433
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,697
Speaker 0: So I had to go to work.

434
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,039
Speaker 1: What if you're a trader, though?

435
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:39,300
Speaker 0: That's a different company, technically.

436
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:40,300
Speaker 1: I know, but I'm saying.

437
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,280
Speaker 0: I ain't a trader.

438
00:27:41,824 --> 00:27:42,520
Speaker 1: There's nothing to do.

439
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,800
Speaker 0: You might be trading all the other markets that aren't in the US.

440
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even when the market's closed, on Labor Day, people don't go to work.

441
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,465
Speaker 0: Some people do.

442
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:52,837
Speaker 0: International trader.

443
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:53,140
Speaker 0: Anyway.

444
00:27:55,183 --> 00:28:04,636
Speaker 0: So we did three hours of panels at this PAX, and one of them is already on the internet because PAX was kind enough to put that panel in the biggest panel room.

445
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:05,840
Speaker 0: that was live streamed.

446
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:06,559
Speaker 1: That was not main events.

447
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:06,960
Speaker 0: Yep.

448
00:28:07,322 --> 00:28:11,680
Speaker 0: So we were live streamed on PAX2, and the VOD for that is on Twitch.

449
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,668
Speaker 1: Twitch.tv/Pax2.

450
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:13,861
Speaker 0: Yep.

451
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:17,435
Speaker 0: The VOD of that is just on the internet.

452
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:18,520
Speaker 0: You can just go watch it.

453
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,500
Speaker 1: That's P-A-X, the number two, not P-A-X-T-W-O.

454
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,907
Speaker 0: There is a link to it on our website.

455
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:25,412
Speaker 0: By the way, we have a website.

456
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:33,416
Speaker 0: You can go to it, and there's stuff there, including our awesome forum, which you should join, because the United's forum is notable in these trying times in that it is 100% Nazi free.

457
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,380
Speaker 0: It is against our terms of service to be a Nazi dipshit in our forums.

458
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,086
Speaker 1: And the way we do this is very simple.

459
00:28:41,226 --> 00:28:49,240
Speaker 1: Because our forum is not enormous, with hundreds and hundreds of people applying, we manually approve or reject every single person who wants to make an account.

460
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,032
Speaker 0: Meaning you have to type a sentence.

461
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:52,020
Speaker 1: Type text.

462
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,749
Speaker 1: Which means if we ban someone, they cannot get back in.

463
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,820
Speaker 1: So if there's a Nazi, we can just delete their post and kick them out at the end.

464
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:02,538
Speaker 1: And if there's a non-Nazi, well, you know, it's like, hey, you're in.

465
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,080
Speaker 1: Good job.

466
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:03,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

467
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,148
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good forum.

468
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:05,751
Speaker 0: You should join it.

469
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:07,319
Speaker 0: There's a lot of stuff going on in there.

470
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,616
Speaker 0: So we will be at the next PAX after MAGFest, where we're doing a bunch of panels.

471
00:29:12,637 --> 00:29:13,580
Speaker 0: Stay tuned for that announcement.

472
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,860
Speaker 1: MAGFest is New Year's, and then there's a MAGFest, and then PAX South is what, two weeks after that?

473
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then PAX East is right around the corner after that.

474
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,899
Speaker 1: Let me check my calendar.

475
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,505
Speaker 0: They're so close together.

476
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:28,460
Speaker 0: I got a lot of panels to write in the next few weeks.

477
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,620
Speaker 0: But at PAX South, we were doing at least one panel, and that panel is a brand new one, never before done anywhere.

478
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,388
Speaker 0: Nostalgia versus game design.

479
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,255
Speaker 0: I'm starting to write it.

480
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:40,420
Speaker 0: I'm feeling pretty good about it.

481
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:42,563
Speaker 0: This is going to be a fun panel.

482
00:29:42,603 --> 00:29:50,600
Speaker 0: This is going to be a lot like the panels we ran around PAX West, PAX East, circa 2010, 2011.

483
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,130
Speaker 0: It's like classic Geek Nights style.

484
00:29:52,171 --> 00:29:53,339
Speaker 0: I'm feeling this panel pretty big.

485
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,993
Speaker 0: Beyond that, expect some live streams, expect some stuff going on.

486
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:01,220
Speaker 0: Stay tuned for on the Geek Nights Patreon.

487
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:09,180
Speaker 0: Me and Emily are going to be doing a parallel podcast where we're going to review and comment on every single Disney animated feature in chronological order.

488
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:10,778
Speaker 0: From beginning to now.

489
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,300
Speaker 1: When's the last time you saw Snow White?

490
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:14,046
Speaker 0: That's it.

491
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:14,999
Speaker 0: We're going to watch them all again.

492
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:28,838
Speaker 0: What we're going to do is we're going to record us recalling what we remember about them, which some of these will be funny because I haven't seen them since my age was in the single digits, and then we're going to watch them.

493
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,070
Speaker 1: Have you even seen all these?

494
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,980
Speaker 1: Have you seen Sleeping Beauty?

495
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:31,420
Speaker 0: Yeah.

496
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:31,653
Speaker 1: Ever?

497
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:32,598
Speaker 0: When I was a little kid.

498
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,020
Speaker 1: There's got to be some you haven't seen.

499
00:30:37,341 --> 00:30:38,650
Speaker 0: Some recent ones, probably.

500
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,060
Speaker 0: I never saw Pocahontas.

501
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:40,797
Speaker 1: Me either.

502
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just never saw it.

503
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:42,400
Speaker 0: I don't need to.

504
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,179
Speaker 0: I think I was in middle school when it came out.

505
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:44,997
Speaker 1: It's going to keep it that way.

506
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,379
Speaker 0: I think it was in sixth grade, I want to say.

507
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,040
Speaker 0: We've even played the music from it in the middle school band, but I had never seen it.

508
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,880
Speaker 0: That was the first time I had to play a mellophone.

509
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,240
Speaker 0: Also, fuck mellophones.

510
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,027
Speaker 0: It's like a harder trumpet.

511
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,859
Speaker 0: They're just not fun to play and they don't sound that good.

512
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:02,725
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

513
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:05,260
Speaker 0: Otherwise, food we hate.

514
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:13,900
Speaker 0: I don't know why you guys love these food shows so much, but I was looking for a show to do tonight, and I haven't yet set up the call-in show, which we will be setting up.

515
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:15,815
Speaker 0: We'll be doing those starting next year.

516
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:16,280
Speaker 0: Stay tuned.

517
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:30,019
Speaker 0: But we do a lot of food shows, and there's a lot of food that I hate is a strong word, but there's food that we both will eat but do not like, and there is food that both of us will not eat.

518
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,866
Speaker 0: So I'm curious.

519
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,620
Speaker 0: What's the line, Scott?

520
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,656
Speaker 0: What is the worst food bar?

521
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:39,180
Speaker 0: Now, again, we're not counting about starvation situation.

522
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:44,279
Speaker 0: Let's assume that we are not starving to death, that we have access to food.

523
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,760
Speaker 1: It sounds like one of those scenarios from a Japanese adventure game.

524
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,763
Speaker 0: There are nine doors.

525
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:55,198
Speaker 0: There are nine fast food restaurants, and you will die in 48 hours.

526
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,399
Speaker 1: What puzzle do I have to solve to get the good food?

527
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:00,499
Speaker 1: Do I have to play the game twice to get the really good food?

528
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,819
Speaker 1: Unlock the secret ending food?

529
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,620
Speaker 0: You've got to eat the Arby's on a Tuesday, or it doesn't unlock the best ending.

530
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,760
Speaker 0: So we're assuming that we are not starving to death, and that within 24 hours of whatever situation we're talking about, we can access better food.

531
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,185
Speaker 0: So I'm curious, Scott.

532
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:21,200
Speaker 0: What is the worst food you would eat?

533
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,859
Speaker 1: Lowest quality food?

534
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:25,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, lowest quality or worst type of food?

535
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,897
Speaker 1: I mean, it just has to be...

536
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,199
Speaker 0: Because they're two different things, I think.

537
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,000
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not starving, so it means I can go without food.

538
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,880
Speaker 0: But it's either you eat this food for dinner, or your next meal is breakfast.

539
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:42,000
Speaker 1: So I'm still hungry.

540
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,780
Speaker 0: You're hungry, but you're not dying.

541
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:46,400
Speaker 0: You've got to skip dinner or eat this food.

542
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,320
Speaker 0: What is the worst kind of food you will eat, in terms of preference?

543
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,698
Speaker 0: Like food you don't like.

544
00:32:52,441 --> 00:32:54,820
Speaker 1: Something I don't want to eat, but I'll eat it anyway?

545
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:56,694
Speaker 0: You don't want to eat it.

546
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:57,359
Speaker 0: You don't like it.

547
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,000
Speaker 0: You'll eat it anyway, rather than skip dinner.

548
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:03,000
Speaker 0: I think that's an interesting line to explore.

549
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,678
Speaker 1: I guess I won't eat a McDonald's.

550
00:33:05,021 --> 00:33:07,279
Speaker 0: I would skip dinner before I'd eat McDonald's.

551
00:33:08,482 --> 00:33:10,300
Speaker 0: I'd definitely skip dinner before I'd eat Burger King.

552
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:11,600
Speaker 1: I wouldn't eat a Burger King either.

553
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:12,400
Speaker 0: I would never eat a Burger King.

554
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:15,339
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I might just eat a fry from McDonald's.

555
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:15,985
Speaker 0: What do you eat?

556
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:16,940
Speaker 0: a fry from Burger King?

557
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:17,899
Speaker 1: It's a fry.

558
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:21,080
Speaker 0: Have you had a Burger King fry in your life?

559
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:24,140
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a very small amount of potato and hot oil.

560
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,538
Speaker 1: It's not really any different than getting a fry from any other, you know.

561
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:30,400
Speaker 1: Other places might have more potato or better oil.

562
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,280
Speaker 0: So I would not eat a McDonald's dinner, like a burger, or anything they make.

563
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:35,878
Speaker 1: Absolutely not.

564
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:42,680
Speaker 0: But I would eat a McDonald's breakfast, or even a McDonald's hash brown, in that situation, rather than skip dinner.

565
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,460
Speaker 0: But I would not eat a McDonald's hamburger under any circumstances.

566
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,019
Speaker 1: McDonald's has an apple you can get.

567
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:49,960
Speaker 0: So an apple, you'd eat an apple instead of dinner?

568
00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:51,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's an apple.

569
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,160
Speaker 0: I think that's fine.

570
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,938
Speaker 1: I would not eat an apple.

571
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:53,971
Speaker 0: So what's the bottom?

572
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,720
Speaker 0: Because an apple's not that bad.

573
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,319
Speaker 0: You like apples.

574
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:57,119
Speaker 1: I do like apples.

575
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,160
Speaker 0: What's the worst food you would eat instead of skipping dinner?

576
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:01,820
Speaker 0: What's the bottom?

577
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,420
Speaker 1: I won't eat a can of tuna fish.

578
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:03,800
Speaker 1: That's gross.

579
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,326
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

580
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:05,018
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

581
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,500
Speaker 0: Of course, you saw that millennials are killing canned tuna.

582
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,440
Speaker 0: No one will eat that bland, garbage canned tuna.

583
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:10,257
Speaker 1: It smells awful.

584
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:10,824
Speaker 0: Yeah.

585
00:34:11,112 --> 00:34:11,420
Speaker 0: It's funny.

586
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,117
Speaker 0: The article was literally like, "Millennials won't eat tuna

587
00:34:14,158 --> 00:34:14,480
Speaker 0: anymore.".

588
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:21,398
Speaker 0: But then the details were, "Millennials want to buy actual tuna and shred it themselves, fresh, rather than buy garbage canned

589
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:21,560
Speaker 0: tuna.".

590
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's too much money and it's not good for fishes.

591
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,580
Speaker 0: Yup, it's also not good.

592
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,799
Speaker 1: I guess I would eat some fish that wasn't too fishy.

593
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:32,478
Speaker 0: So what's too fishy?

594
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,060
Speaker 0: What's your line?

595
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,279
Speaker 1: Well, because you get fish.

596
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:36,540
Speaker 1: You buy fish sticks, right?

597
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:37,500
Speaker 1: Fish sticks are too fishy.

598
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,239
Speaker 1: You buy it from the grocery store, like frozen fish sticks.

599
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,148
Speaker 0: I would eat frozen fish sticks.

600
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,260
Speaker 1: They smell way fishy and gross.

601
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:45,040
Speaker 0: See, I like fishy fish.

602
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:46,139
Speaker 1: I don't like fishy fish.

603
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:48,380
Speaker 0: I like a really fishy fish.

604
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:49,199
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

605
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,400
Speaker 1: If it's too ocean-y, you know, it's like that doesn't taste good.

606
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:52,900
Speaker 0: I like that kind.

607
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:54,899
Speaker 0: I'll just eat anchovies straight up.

608
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,120
Speaker 1: I mean, I like anchovy, but those aren't too fishy.

609
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,500
Speaker 1: They're salty and it's a different flavor than anchovy.

610
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,279
Speaker 0: They're pretty fishy, too.

611
00:35:03,943 --> 00:35:05,500
Speaker 0: You usually don't eat a lot of anchovy.

612
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:11,280
Speaker 1: There's this smell you get when you go to a low-quality seafood restaurant.

613
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,880
Speaker 0: Oh, but I love that fishy fish.

614
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,020
Speaker 1: You buy a crappy piece of fish that is low-quality or frozen.

615
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,000
Speaker 1: It's just like plain, boring, white fish of some kind.

616
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,034
Speaker 1: It smells way fishy, like it's got ocean all over it.

617
00:35:23,783 --> 00:35:24,240
Speaker 1: I don't like that.

618
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:33,660
Speaker 1: But if you just take the fish and you just decrease that fishy level to the point at which I can eat it without being like, "Ew," even though I might be like, "Eh," right?

619
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:44,220
Speaker 1: And that, I guess, is the food that I like the least because you can just adjust that level of fishiness to the point at which I will eat it to not go hungry rather than be hungry, but I'm still not happy.

620
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,499
Speaker 1: I would rather eat something else.

621
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:50,673
Speaker 0: I think my line is not the Arby's roast beef sandwich because I will never eat one of those again in my life.

622
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,060
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, I love Arby's, but at Arby's, I do not eat roast beef at all.

623
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,207
Speaker 1: Ew.

624
00:35:54,644 --> 00:35:55,468
Speaker 1: I would not eat -- I used to.

625
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:56,979
Speaker 0: I used to every day.

626
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,800
Speaker 0: Remember, kids, when we were young -- I would eat McDonald's before I ate the roast beef at Arby's.

627
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,540
Speaker 0: When I was in high school, like sophomore year, I would drive.

628
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:13,760
Speaker 0: I'd just walk out of the school around lunchtime, drive to the mall, go to the Arby's in the mall, and eat like a roast beef sandwich and some curly fries and a Jamoca shake.

629
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,839
Speaker 0: And that was my lunch.

630
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:21,039
Speaker 1: At Arby's, the thing is, I would go right now to an Arby's to eat -- The chicken fingers.

631
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,360
Speaker 1: The chicken fingers and, of course, the curly fry.

632
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:24,140
Speaker 1: Curly fries.

633
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,160
Speaker 1: Because while that curly fry isn't, say, really any different than McDonald's fry, it does have, A, a little bit more potato.

634
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,220
Speaker 0: Two, it's got flavor powder, which you seem to hate in other contexts.

635
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,380
Speaker 1: B, a curly shape, and C, a flavor that is not just oil and salt.

636
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:48,220
Speaker 0: I think the line for me, in terms of quality and type combined, is I would order Arby's chicken fingers and curly fries.

637
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,020
Speaker 0: I would eat that rather than go hungry.

638
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,600
Speaker 1: Even though those fried chicken fingers have a very small amount of chicken.

639
00:36:53,183 --> 00:36:54,480
Speaker 1: They're way better than a chicken McNugget.

640
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,937
Speaker 0: Way better.

641
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,320
Speaker 0: But anything -- I would not eat a fast food worse than that for dinner.

642
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,220
Speaker 0: But I consider a White Castle burger to be better than that.

643
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,660
Speaker 1: I would not eat almost anything at White Castle.

644
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:06,938
Speaker 0: I'd eat a White Castle burger right now.

645
00:37:07,187 --> 00:37:07,273
Speaker 0: No.

646
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:09,180
Speaker 0: Like, I would just eat that on purpose.

647
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:09,680
Speaker 0: No.

648
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,780
Speaker 0: In a non-dire situation, I would eat a White Castle.

649
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,146
Speaker 0: No.

650
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:19,320
Speaker 0: The only reason I don't, honestly, is that all the White Castles in New York are disgusting.

651
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,040
Speaker 1: The one near me went out of business, and so there was a regional office also here.

652
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:23,919
Speaker 1: It also went closed.

653
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,240
Speaker 1: The last time I ate at a White Castle -- There's a cool building over there that still has a castle on the corner of it.

654
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:29,180
Speaker 0: I went to one in the Bronx.

655
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,040
Speaker 1: It used to be the regional office.

656
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,400
Speaker 0: I went to one -- I worked at the hospital.

657
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,660
Speaker 0: I went to one in the Bronx that was kind of near one of my offices.

658
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:40,860
Speaker 0: And, like, the interior of it, one, had, like, bulletproof glass and a metal detector and a cop.

659
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:43,460
Speaker 0: And then inside of it, it was filthy.

660
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:51,880
Speaker 0: And I ate there once, and I vowed to never eat there again because the environment was too disgusting.

661
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:56,840
Speaker 0: But otherwise, I like the sensation of eating a White Castle burger.

662
00:37:57,763 --> 00:38:00,280
Speaker 0: But I would not eat a McDonald's burger under any circumstances.

663
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:01,760
Speaker 0: I would definitely go hungry.

664
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:07,260
Speaker 1: Well, some people in our chat have mentioned Taco Bell, a place that I will never eat.

665
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,719
Speaker 1: Taco Bell is okay, though.

666
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:09,559
Speaker 1: I will not eat it.

667
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:16,020
Speaker 0: Taco Bell is just a low-quality but perfectly serviceable taco that arguably probably doesn't have much meat in it, if any meat.

668
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:17,098
Speaker 1: I will not eat a Taco Bell.

669
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:18,240
Speaker 0: I would eat a Taco Bell.

670
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:18,698
Speaker 0: I would not.

671
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,266
Speaker 0: Why not?

672
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:20,020
Speaker 1: Taco Bell's fine.

673
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,460
Speaker 1: I mean, there are places I would eat -- I would rather sooner eat Taco Bell than White Castle, but that doesn't mean I will eat Taco Bell.

674
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:32,180
Speaker 0: Taco Bell is higher-quality food stuff than White Castle.

675
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:34,400
Speaker 0: The ingredients are fine.

676
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,270
Speaker 1: But I still won't eat there.

677
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,100
Speaker 1: It's still below the line.

678
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:37,510
Speaker 2: I'd say it's above the line.

679
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,440
Speaker 0: I would eat at a Taco Bell.

680
00:38:38,581 --> 00:38:40,159
Speaker 1: It's just closer to the line than White Castle is.

681
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,474
Speaker 0: I'd eat at a Taco Bell before I'd go hungry, but I would not eat at most.

682
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:46,280
Speaker 0: gennaro delis in midtown Manhattan.

683
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,619
Speaker 1: Depends on what I get at the gennaro deli.

684
00:38:50,024 --> 00:38:50,940
Speaker 0: The one by Grand Central?

685
00:38:51,466 --> 00:38:52,020
Speaker 1: I don't know which one.

686
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:52,696
Speaker 1: The big one?

687
00:38:53,323 --> 00:38:53,939
Speaker 1: I don't know which one.

688
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:54,552
Speaker 0: On 41st Street?

689
00:38:55,521 --> 00:38:58,060
Speaker 0: We've walked past this place many times in our lives.

690
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,319
Speaker 1: There's a lot of gennaro delis.

691
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,280
Speaker 0: But every time we've walked past this one, you've always pointed it out and said we should never eat there.

692
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:04,007
Speaker 1: Maybe.

693
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:04,500
Speaker 1: I don't know.

694
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,276
Speaker 0: You don't remember this?

695
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:05,631
Speaker 0: No.

696
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:06,258
Speaker 0: Okay.

697
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:08,720
Speaker 0: It's called the stage doors.

698
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:12,600
Speaker 0: It's on 41st and Pershing Square.

699
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:16,900
Speaker 0: I feel like the next time we walk by, I'm going to point it out.

700
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,640
Speaker 0: I would not eat there under any circumstances.

701
00:39:19,161 --> 00:39:21,480
Speaker 0: I've also seen it closed down by the health department multiple times.

702
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:24,016
Speaker 1: I won't eat at a place that I know has issues.

703
00:39:25,602 --> 00:39:29,300
Speaker 1: In New York City, it's a lot easier to know when places have issues because they have a grading system going on.

704
00:39:30,531 --> 00:39:31,360
Speaker 1: Some places don't have that.

705
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,079
Speaker 0: Here's a question.

706
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,200
Speaker 0: What is the worst food you've ever eaten on purpose?

707
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,193
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

708
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:38,899
Speaker 1: Unhealthiest?

709
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,520
Speaker 0: Whatever you mean by worst.

710
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,780
Speaker 0: The worst food you've eaten on purpose in your whole life or in your adult life?

711
00:39:46,403 --> 00:39:47,940
Speaker 1: There have been a couple times.

712
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,719
Speaker 0: Because as a kid, I would eat Cheetos.

713
00:39:50,526 --> 00:39:52,340
Speaker 0: I like Cheetos and Doritos.

714
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,379
Speaker 1: There have been times where we deep fried various things and ate them.

715
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:08,720
Speaker 1: There are also times, I think at least a couple times in my youth where you've played that game where you combine a bunch of beverages into some concoction and dare people to drink it and someone sips it and it's whatever.

716
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:11,800
Speaker 0: I only ever played that game in the context of watching other people do it.

717
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,340
Speaker 0: I was never dumb enough to do it myself.

718
00:40:14,523 --> 00:40:16,240
Speaker 1: I don't remember really the details.

719
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,419
Speaker 1: I just remember it being a thing.

720
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:19,660
Speaker 1: Because I have specific memories.

721
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:29,060
Speaker 0: The worst food I ever put in my mouth on purpose was that off-brand big boy on the New York State Thruway on that terrible trip we took to Rochester that one time.

722
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:35,000
Speaker 0: To this day, that meal stands out as the worst food I've ever put in my mouth on purpose in my entire life.

723
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:35,619
Speaker 0: It was not good.

724
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,899
Speaker 0: It filled my stomach, but it did not sate me.

725
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:42,760
Speaker 0: It's like in Chrono Trigger, but you're still hungry.

726
00:40:43,184 --> 00:40:44,057
Speaker 0: I just felt worse.

727
00:40:44,882 --> 00:40:50,360
Speaker 1: I mean, I have eaten at McDonald's, Burger King, and such in the past, just the very, very deep past.

728
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,283
Speaker 0: When was the last time?

729
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:55,480
Speaker 0: Because I ate a McDonald's breakfast occasionally when I ski.

730
00:40:56,282 --> 00:40:58,000
Speaker 0: The last time I ate a McDonald's burger?

731
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:00,739
Speaker 1: The last time I ate a McDonald's...

732
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,841
Speaker 0: I think was before the year 2000.

733
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:04,988
Speaker 1: Maybe...

734
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:06,520
Speaker 0: It was definitely high school.

735
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,019
Speaker 1: So in the year 2000, I ate ice cream from a McDonald's in Israel.

736
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:12,892
Speaker 1: And in my seventh grade, I ate...

737
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,759
Speaker 0: Nando's chicken is perfectly fine.

738
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:19,600
Speaker 1: Why would you not eat at Nando's?

739
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,020
Speaker 0: I would eat Nando's chicken before I would eat at any other fast food restaurant on earth.

740
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would give up Chipotle before I give up Nando's.

741
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,278
Speaker 0: I avoid Chipotle.

742
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:30,100
Speaker 1: I go to Chipotle.

743
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,631
Speaker 0: When I go to Chipotle, I never get meat.

744
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:32,780
Speaker 0: I only get the sofritas.

745
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:34,365
Speaker 1: I like sofritas.

746
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,840
Speaker 1: I get them the most, but I also get other things, like the limited-time chorizo.

747
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,020
Speaker 1: They're trying to make it the big rib of Chipotle, the big rib of Chipotle.

748
00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:43,700
Speaker 1: It's a good strategy.

749
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,240
Speaker 1: But it's not McRib.

750
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:46,359
Speaker 1: Which I would not eat.

751
00:41:47,762 --> 00:41:53,980
Speaker 0: The worst thing I ever put in my mouth ever, though, on purpose was... I like energy drinks, but remember when there was that cocaine energy drink?

752
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:54,999
Speaker 1: Oh, right, you tried that.

753
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,239
Speaker 1: Didn't you try the Four Loko also?

754
00:41:57,761 --> 00:41:59,191
Speaker 0: Four Loko didn't actually taste bad.

755
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:00,279
Speaker 0: It's just bad for you.

756
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:01,219
Speaker 1: You tasted it, though.

757
00:42:01,362 --> 00:42:02,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, it tasted fine.

758
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,179
Speaker 0: You know what it tasted like?

759
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:08,480
Speaker 0: It tasted like a bad 40 mixed with a Red Bull.

760
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:12,760
Speaker 1: Oh, one time, I was drinking some apple juice.

761
00:42:13,905 --> 00:42:15,900
Speaker 1: It was just grocery store brand apple juice.

762
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,940
Speaker 1: But I didn't notice until I sipped it that it had something growing in there.

763
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,544
Speaker 1: Ooh, ooh.

764
00:42:23,102 --> 00:42:30,060
Speaker 1: There was some sort of solid, floaty, cloudy mass in the cup at the bottom.

765
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:33,416
Speaker 1: But also, it tasted like poison.

766
00:42:35,382 --> 00:42:37,576
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I like Red Bull.

767
00:42:37,636 --> 00:42:38,280
Speaker 0: I like energy drinks.

768
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,388
Speaker 1: I didn't drink much of it.

769
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:40,340
Speaker 1: I just was like bleh.

770
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,997
Speaker 0: So I bought that cocaine energy drink because I was like, "Okay, it's just like another energy drink.

771
00:42:45,037 --> 00:42:45,539
Speaker 0: I will try

772
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:45,620
Speaker 0: it.".

773
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,580
Speaker 0: And when I opened the can, I could smell it a little bit.

774
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,576
Speaker 0: And part of my brain said, "This is

775
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:52,159
Speaker 0: poison.".

776
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:54,374
Speaker 0: I suppressed that little part of my brain.

777
00:42:54,394 --> 00:42:55,020
Speaker 0: I took one sip.

778
00:42:55,861 --> 00:43:01,280
Speaker 0: It tasted the worst... It was the worst taste I have ever experienced in my entire life.

779
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,400
Speaker 0: That big boy meal tasted like sadness.

780
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:06,299
Speaker 0: This tasted like death.

781
00:43:07,402 --> 00:43:10,259
Speaker 0: I literally spit it out and I threw it away.

782
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,918
Speaker 0: And I never looked back.

783
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,780
Speaker 1: One time in a dim sum, was it Mike Lynn?

784
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,706
Speaker 1: He was like, "Hey, hey, hey.

785
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:19,758
Speaker 1: I'll try to get these white people to eat weird foods at the dim

786
00:43:19,778 --> 00:43:19,999
Speaker 1: sum.".

787
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,406
Speaker 0: That didn't work on us.

788
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,778
Speaker 0: I'd bite each one and be like, "I don't like this, but

789
00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:24,119
Speaker 0: okay.".

790
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:24,885
Speaker 0: So he got pig's ear.

791
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,487
Speaker 0: Pig's ear's okay.

792
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:28,700
Speaker 0: I like to nibble on a pig's ear.

793
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:32,360
Speaker 1: So I nibbled on the pig's ear and it tasted like pork, which is fine.

794
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,386
Speaker 1: It tasted just fine.

795
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:37,520
Speaker 1: The problem is it was so fucking chewy, I could not chew it to a point at which I could swallow it.

796
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:39,808
Speaker 0: That's the same problem I had with tripe.

797
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:41,135
Speaker 0: I do not like tripe.

798
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:41,940
Speaker 0: I will not eat tripe.

799
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,020
Speaker 1: Then I had a tasteless mass of cartilage in my mouth.

800
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,960
Speaker 1: Then I spit it out after I had extracted all of the pork flavor.

801
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:49,760
Speaker 1: Tripe tastes good, but it's basically just...

802
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,506
Speaker 0: It's like meat gum.

803
00:43:51,586 --> 00:43:54,360
Speaker 0: If I could treat it like gum but spit it out, I'd probably eat more tripe.

804
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,620
Speaker 1: That also happens to me sometimes with very poorly cooked steaks.

805
00:43:57,984 --> 00:43:59,019
Speaker 1: I'll chew them.

806
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,677
Speaker 0: Then you get that little meat gum remainder.

807
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:07,139
Speaker 1: I get some part of it, or maybe the whole thing if it's real bad, where I cannot chew it sufficiently to the point where I can swallow it.

808
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:08,539
Speaker 0: You spit it into a napkin and bite it.

809
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:10,880
Speaker 1: All of the meat flavor has been extracted.

810
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,340
Speaker 1: Then I spit out this gray mass into a napkin.

811
00:44:14,801 --> 00:44:16,760
Speaker 0: Yup, I've done the gray mass into the napkin before.

812
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,434
Speaker 1: It's like, "Well, this isn't a good

813
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:18,697
Speaker 1: steak.".

814
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,299
Speaker 0: You know where I would commonly do that?

815
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:23,460
Speaker 0: With about 10% of a steak on French bread.

816
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,060
Speaker 1: Actually, I never had that problem with steak on French bread.

817
00:44:27,221 --> 00:44:27,664
Speaker 0: Usually not.

818
00:44:27,684 --> 00:44:30,079
Speaker 0: There'd always be a little bit, but sometimes I just swallow it.

819
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,286
Speaker 0: It was near the line.

820
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,620
Speaker 0: That steak on French bread was probably the best value per dollar of food we had in our entire lives.

821
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,020
Speaker 0: This chat's got a lot of opinions.

822
00:44:43,022 --> 00:44:44,800
Speaker 1: People like food shows for some reason.

823
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,273
Speaker 0: I don't understand anti-nando sentiment.

824
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:48,380
Speaker 0: Nando's is pretty good.

825
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,780
Speaker 1: If you like food shows so much, send us more food show ideas for Thursday.

826
00:44:55,042 --> 00:45:15,636
Speaker 0: One thing I've noticed, though, is that as I've gotten not just older, and not even necessarily wealthier, but living in places where I have more access to better quality food, irrespective of price, if I go to a crapo Chinese place in Flushing, it's really high-quality Chinese food that's very flavorful.

827
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,940
Speaker 0: I can't eat the non-flavorful Chinese food in Michigan.

828
00:45:22,901 --> 00:45:24,999
Speaker 1: But if you had only lived in Michigan, you could.

829
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,742
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could.

830
00:45:25,822 --> 00:45:30,260
Speaker 0: I used to eat Chinese food that by my modern palate tastes like nothing.

831
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,980
Speaker 0: It tastes like just MSG on cardboard.

832
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,098
Speaker 1: You can't eat Seattle pizza.

833
00:45:34,904 --> 00:45:36,260
Speaker 1: You can't eat Dunkin' Donuts bagel.

834
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:36,642
Speaker 1: Nope.

835
00:45:36,905 --> 00:45:38,240
Speaker 0: I can't eat a Dunkin' Donuts donut.

836
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:40,259
Speaker 1: I can eat a Dunkin' Donuts donut.

837
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:42,620
Speaker 0: When was the last time you ate a Dunkin' Donuts donut?

838
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,097
Speaker 0: This year.

839
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,460
Speaker 0: They are not worth eating.

840
00:45:45,581 --> 00:45:48,420
Speaker 0: I would go hungry before I'd eat a Dunkin' Donuts donut.

841
00:45:48,722 --> 00:45:49,065
Speaker 0: I'm out.

842
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:49,874
Speaker 1: I'm biking.

843
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:50,440
Speaker 1: It's morning.

844
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,650
Speaker 1: I want some sugar.

845
00:45:51,812 --> 00:45:52,094
Speaker 1: Oh, look.

846
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:52,780
Speaker 1: They're selling sugar.

847
00:45:53,465 --> 00:45:54,039
Speaker 0: I'll buy it.

848
00:45:54,281 --> 00:45:54,778
Speaker 0: Scott, it's New York.

849
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,979
Speaker 0: There's probably a real donut within like a half a mile of wherever you are.

850
00:45:59,321 --> 00:45:59,908
Speaker 1: In New Jersey.

851
00:46:00,212 --> 00:46:00,719
Speaker 1: The biking group.

852
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,660
Speaker 1: The biking group stops at the Dunkin' Donuts.

853
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,399
Speaker 1: You should have brought food with you.

854
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,640
Speaker 1: I did, but I wanted to buy a sugar other than the sugar I was carrying.

855
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,100
Speaker 0: Dunkin' Donuts, I would go hungry.

856
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,179
Speaker 0: You know, back to our scenario.

857
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:14,680
Speaker 0: I would go hungry and skip dinner rather than eat Dunkin' Donuts food.

858
00:46:16,062 --> 00:46:17,375
Speaker 1: A donut is just a sugar ring.

859
00:46:17,436 --> 00:46:17,820
Speaker 1: It's fine.

860
00:46:18,161 --> 00:46:19,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't need the sugar ring.

861
00:46:20,103 --> 00:46:22,880
Speaker 0: I will not eat a sugar ring that tastes like just sugar and ring.

862
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,579
Speaker 1: That's what it tastes like.

863
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:28,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, it tastes like a ring of cardboard with sugar on it.

864
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,254
Speaker 1: No, it's just sugar and it tastes fine.

865
00:46:30,274 --> 00:46:30,800
Speaker 1: It tastes like sugar.

866
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:31,739
Speaker 1: Sugar tastes great.

867
00:46:33,242 --> 00:46:33,839
Speaker 0: It's unsatisfying.

868
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,350
Speaker 1: It's not like it's hard or anything.

869
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:36,440
Speaker 1: The bagel tastes like nothing.

870
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,200
Speaker 1: The bagel I won't eat.

871
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,620
Speaker 0: I can't eat just a bagel that's just bread.

872
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,380
Speaker 0: It's like, alright, this is basically just Wonder Bread in the shape of a bagel.

873
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I will not eat a bread ring, but I will eat a sugar ring.

874
00:46:45,442 --> 00:46:46,640
Speaker 0: I won't eat a sugar ring anymore.

875
00:46:46,923 --> 00:46:47,660
Speaker 1: Alright, don't.

876
00:46:47,922 --> 00:46:48,507
Speaker 0: I just can't.

877
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:50,119
Speaker 0: It just doesn't satisfy me.

878
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:50,700
Speaker 0: Don't think.

879
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,719
Speaker 0: I feel better by avoiding it than eating it.

880
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,136
Speaker 1: Okay.

881
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:54,776
Speaker 1: Do what you gotta do.

882
00:46:55,641 --> 00:46:57,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I'm gonna come and avoid Dunkin' Donuts.

883
00:46:57,804 --> 00:46:58,060
Speaker 1: Okay.

884
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,659
Speaker 0: Alright, I think we might have killed enough time.

885
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:02,660
Speaker 1: Mustn't kill time, boy.

886
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:03,619
Speaker 1: Cherish it.

887
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,759
Speaker 1: You must cherish the sugar ring.

888
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,127
Speaker 0: Alright, I guess the last thing.

889
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,680
Speaker 0: What are the foods you just don't like?

890
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,340
Speaker 0: Like, let's just try to list the foods we don't like.

891
00:47:10,082 --> 00:47:11,353
Speaker 0: Neither one of us are picky eaters.

892
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:12,240
Speaker 0: We eat a lot.

893
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,500
Speaker 1: There are foods that I like or might like but won't eat.

894
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,860
Speaker 1: Actually, I've never tried it, but I'm pretty sure shark fin soup probably tastes good.

895
00:47:20,362 --> 00:47:22,133
Speaker 1: So, my guess would be that it tastes great.

896
00:47:22,415 --> 00:47:23,160
Speaker 1: I will not eat that.

897
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:27,300
Speaker 0: It's been served to me, and I have a rule generally that...

898
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,099
Speaker 1: I know that foie gras tastes great because I've had it, but I'm not gonna order it.

899
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:43,260
Speaker 0: It has been served to me, and my rule is, if I have ethical concerns about a food, but unbeknownst to me and without my input, it is prepared for me, I will usually eat it so it doesn't go to waste.

900
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,280
Speaker 0: And in those cases, in that context, I have had rabbit, even though I don't want to eat rabbit.

901
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,118
Speaker 0: I have had shark fin soup, even though I don't want shark fin soup.

902
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:52,829
Speaker 0: Was it good?

903
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:53,379
Speaker 1: I haven't had it.

904
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:54,839
Speaker 0: No, it was kind of bland.

905
00:47:56,283 --> 00:47:57,419
Speaker 1: I've been told it was rich.

906
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,836
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, you can make it rich, but I've had better soups.

907
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:01,238
Speaker 0: It wasn't...

908
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:04,277
Speaker 1: Did you have a bad shark fin soup or shark fin soup?

909
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:04,640
Speaker 1: just bad?

910
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,260
Speaker 0: This was shark fin soup served to me illicitly in Hong Kong at a rich person's thing.

911
00:48:10,447 --> 00:48:10,719
Speaker 1: Okay.

912
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,720
Speaker 0: It was good, but it was not good enough to justify the cruelty.

913
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,879
Speaker 1: It wasn't foie gras good.

914
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:20,980
Speaker 0: So foie gras has been served to me twice without me ordering it in my adult life.

915
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:33,520
Speaker 0: One time, Emily and I were at a super fancy French restaurant having a very expensive, fancy date night, and the waiter just comes over and hands us something and puts it on the table, and it's a pâté of some kind and walks away.

916
00:48:34,382 --> 00:48:37,099
Speaker 0: And we just both assume, "All right, I guess they just serve this to

917
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:37,260
Speaker 0: us.".

918
00:48:37,763 --> 00:48:40,080
Speaker 0: We immediately eat it, because it wasn't that much.

919
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,080
Speaker 0: It was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my life.

920
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,691
Speaker 0: The waiter comes back and is like, "Oh, sorry, that was for another tête,".

921
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:48,940
Speaker 0: and it's gone, because we've already eaten it.

922
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,220
Speaker 0: We've eaten it in the 30 seconds before we realize he delivered this very expensive foie gras to the wrong table.

923
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,423
Speaker 0: We just ate it.

924
00:48:56,127 --> 00:48:58,260
Speaker 0: He was a little miffed that we just ate it.

925
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:58,925
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't you?

926
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:00,299
Speaker 1: You put food on my table, I eat it.

927
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:00,610
Speaker 0: Yup.

928
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,640
Speaker 0: And it was really, really, really, really, really delicious.

929
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:06,297
Speaker 0: Of course.

930
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,240
Speaker 0: But I will never order foie gras.

931
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,320
Speaker 1: It's a fatty goose liver.

932
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:19,980
Speaker 0: If I ever had to make an exception, I would be willing to entertain ordering foie gras if I knew that it was hunted as opposed to farmed.

933
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:20,839
Speaker 1: It won't taste as good.

934
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,879
Speaker 0: It would arguably taste better.

935
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,579
Speaker 1: Just like veal won't taste as good.

936
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:30,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I try to avoid eating veal, but it ends up being one of many ingredients in many Italian dishes.

937
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,086
Speaker 1: Like a meatball that has veal in it?

938
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:37,460
Speaker 0: I will never order a veal by itself.

939
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,200
Speaker 1: I try to avoid eating veal.

940
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,400
Speaker 1: I haven't eaten it probably in years, unless it's been, say, in a meatball.

941
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:52,500
Speaker 1: But I will, super rarely, as in less than once a year, order a veal because it tastes real good and it's less evil than foie gras while still being very evil.

942
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,152
Speaker 0: At least farmed foie gras is awful.

943
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,400
Speaker 1: It is less evil than a nortolin bunting, which I won't eat.

944
00:49:57,641 --> 00:49:59,220
Speaker 0: I would never eat a nortolin bunting.

945
00:50:00,102 --> 00:50:11,860
Speaker 0: I would consider de-friending someone or disowning a family member who ate nortolin bunting because that just feels like it's done for the sake of being awful.

946
00:50:12,244 --> 00:50:12,375
Speaker 1: It is.

947
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:12,870
Speaker 0: Yeah.

948
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,340
Speaker 1: You're exactly right.

949
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:14,960
Speaker 0: It can't be good.

950
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:21,560
Speaker 0: If you like Armagnac so much and you want to have this experience, just get a regular pheasant and cook it in Armagnac.

951
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:22,980
Speaker 0: It's not going to be different.

952
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:25,240
Speaker 1: I won't eat anything that's too smart like dolphin.

953
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,500
Speaker 1: I won't eat anything harmful like a monkey brain.

954
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,740
Speaker 1: I won't eat an octopus because it's too smart.

955
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:31,720
Speaker 0: So I have a problem.

956
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,320
Speaker 1: I also won't eat squid tentacles even though squids are stupid.

957
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,340
Speaker 0: They're not as stupid as people say, Scott.

958
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,920
Speaker 0: I've learned some things about squid.

959
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,719
Speaker 1: Yes, but they're stupider than an octopus.

960
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,900
Speaker 0: Arguably, they're similarly intelligent in a different way.

961
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,529
Speaker 1: Either way, I'm not eating them.

962
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:52,959
Speaker 1: so it doesn't matter why I don't eat them because the tentacles, even regardless of their smartness, tentacles are just too damn chewy.

963
00:50:53,382 --> 00:50:55,040
Speaker 0: That's just because you got bad ones like scallops.

964
00:50:55,261 --> 00:51:02,060
Speaker 0: You don't like mediocre to average or even above average scallops, but I know you for a fact like good scallops.

965
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:03,580
Speaker 1: Well, at least the scallop isn't smart at all.

966
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,939
Speaker 1: It's just a shell that opens and closes.

967
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:07,880
Speaker 1: As far as I know, a scallop is dumb as a brick.

968
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,099
Speaker 1: It just opens and closes.

969
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,336
Speaker 0: So all I'm going to tell you...

970
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,978
Speaker 1: And it's a little white blob that shimmies.

971
00:51:13,181 --> 00:51:13,960
Speaker 1: It doesn't do anything.

972
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:15,240
Speaker 0: You can use this information...

973
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,680
Speaker 1: You can't open a lock like an octopus.

974
00:51:17,021 --> 00:51:18,060
Speaker 0: I provide you information.

975
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,159
Speaker 0: You can use it as you see fit.

976
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,553
Speaker 0: Octopus tentacle that is good.

977
00:51:21,654 --> 00:51:30,040
Speaker 0: octopus tentacle is as good and as different from regular octopus tentacle as the good scallop is from the regular scallop.

978
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,300
Speaker 1: I'm still not eating a takoyaki even though it's probably fucking delicious.

979
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,640
Speaker 0: Takoyaki is so good.

980
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,540
Speaker 1: I'm not eating it because...

981
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,440
Speaker 0: It's one of my favorite foods.

982
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,620
Speaker 1: It's made of octopus.

983
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's so good.

984
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,500
Speaker 1: Find me a proven dumbass octopus.

985
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,399
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll try one.

986
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, just jerk octopus.

987
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,318
Speaker 0: Like find one who specifically did something bad.

988
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,200
Speaker 1: Oh, like yeah, even though it's smart, we can see...

989
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,260
Speaker 0: Find one who committed a crime.

990
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,620
Speaker 0: If they're smart enough, they know the difference between good and evil.

991
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,070
Speaker 1: Even though it's smart, we can see.

992
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,458
Speaker 1: this is clearly a bad octopus that deserved to be eaten.

993
00:51:56,788 --> 00:51:57,400
Speaker 0: I won't eat natto.

994
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,319
Speaker 0: That shit's disgusting.

995
00:51:58,884 --> 00:51:59,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, it smells bad.

996
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:00,578
Speaker 0: I won't eat vegemite.

997
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:01,480
Speaker 0: That shit's disgusting.

998
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,097
Speaker 0: I ate it once.

999
00:52:02,641 --> 00:52:04,500
Speaker 0: It doesn't taste good, so I don't need it anymore.

1000
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,080
Speaker 0: I've tried vegemite.

1001
00:52:06,303 --> 00:52:07,100
Speaker 0: I've tried marmite.

1002
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,358
Speaker 0: Marmite is a...

1003
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,700
Speaker 1: I haven't tried the marmite.

1004
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:16,618
Speaker 0: Imagine vegemite, but like grosser and more gooey.

1005
00:52:17,463 --> 00:52:18,138
Speaker 1: I'm not eating that.

1006
00:52:18,482 --> 00:52:19,160
Speaker 0: Like bitter.

1007
00:52:20,201 --> 00:52:20,880
Speaker 0: Like runnier.

1008
00:52:21,422 --> 00:52:23,160
Speaker 0: Like imagine runny vegemite.

1009
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:23,780
Speaker 1: That is worse.

1010
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,340
Speaker 0: It is so gross.

1011
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,139
Speaker 1: I will not eat that.

1012
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:30,720
Speaker 0: Because I had vegemite before and you hadn't when we were in Australia.

1013
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,319
Speaker 0: And you really wanted to try it.

1014
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,160
Speaker 1: I was in Australia.

1015
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:33,776
Speaker 1: That's the thing to do.

1016
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:34,960
Speaker 1: You know what I learned?

1017
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,040
Speaker 1: If you go to Australia, Pat, you don't need to worry about the vegemite.

1018
00:52:39,001 --> 00:52:40,239
Speaker 1: You just got to get the Tim Tams.

1019
00:52:40,821 --> 00:52:43,620
Speaker 1: Tim Tams are the thing you want from Australia, not vegemite.

1020
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,979
Speaker 1: They should really decrease their telling tourists about vegemite, which I think they do just as like a trap.

1021
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,839
Speaker 1: And they should increase telling tourists about Tim Tams.

1022
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,558
Speaker 0: But even then, the real secret of Australia is the big brekkie.

1023
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,217
Speaker 0: Tim Tam.

1024
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,259
Speaker 0: Tim Tams are okay.

1025
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:05,680
Speaker 0: Tim Tams are like... They're basically like... They're equivalent of some of that New Jersey, Pennsylvania high food that we enjoy.

1026
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:08,340
Speaker 0: Or at least that Dave Riley and Joel White enjoy.

1027
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,780
Speaker 0: In fact, I remember you, me, and Sherba went to that grocery store to buy that vegemite.

1028
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:14,860
Speaker 1: I'm the one who wanted to go to a grocery store.

1029
00:53:15,243 --> 00:53:16,900
Speaker 1: I always like to go to a grocery store wherever I go.

1030
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,120
Speaker 1: I went to the grocery store in Aruba, went to the grocery store in Australia, grocery store in Israel.

1031
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:24,059
Speaker 1: If I'm coming to your country, I'm going to the grocery store.

1032
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:25,520
Speaker 0: I don't like tripe, like I said.

1033
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:26,715
Speaker 0: I just don't enjoy tripe.

1034
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:30,440
Speaker 0: I don't like chicken feet and all those kinds of things.

1035
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:32,297
Speaker 0: I'll eat them, I just don't like them.

1036
00:53:33,341 --> 00:53:35,840
Speaker 1: Chicken feet, I'll eat it, but I won't order it.

1037
00:53:36,081 --> 00:53:37,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like them.

1038
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,260
Speaker 0: But if they're there, I might eat a couple.

1039
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:38,736
Speaker 1: I'm down with it.

1040
00:53:39,021 --> 00:53:41,020
Speaker 1: You order some chicken feet and dim sum, it's like I'll bite one.

1041
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,595
Speaker 0: I'll eat a little bit.

1042
00:53:42,781 --> 00:53:44,920
Speaker 0: But there's not that many foods I don't like.

1043
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,079
Speaker 0: It's a pretty short list.

1044
00:53:46,303 --> 00:53:47,260
Speaker 1: I'll eat almost any food.

1045
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,460
Speaker 1: It's just beverages, I'm very limited in the beverage department.

1046
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:51,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll drink a lot of things too.

1047
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,080
Speaker 0: I got this really good dog cushion.

1048
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,288
Speaker 1: Oh, you know what I don't like.

1049
00:53:54,308 --> 00:53:55,919
Speaker 1: that is a normal food that other people like?

1050
00:53:56,485 --> 00:53:57,100
Speaker 1: Is artichoke.

1051
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:57,817
Speaker 1: I don't like artichoke.

1052
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,619
Speaker 0: What the fuck is wrong with you?

1053
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,117
Speaker 0: Tastes bad.

1054
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,719
Speaker 0: I don't know, artichoke is one of my favorite foods.

1055
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,377
Speaker 1: Tastes bad.

1056
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:04,580
Speaker 0: Don't eat it.

1057
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,740
Speaker 0: Like artichokes and brussels sprouts and all those things?

1058
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,480
Speaker 1: Brussels sprout is great.

1059
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,840
Speaker 1: Brussels sprout is the best.

1060
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,160
Speaker 1: Brussels sprout is like top tier vegetable.

1061
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,380
Speaker 0: Have you ever had, what about artichoke dip?

1062
00:54:13,862 --> 00:54:14,390
Speaker 1: No, it's also bad.

1063
00:54:16,148 --> 00:54:17,019
Speaker 0: But you like guacamole?

1064
00:54:18,362 --> 00:54:19,279
Speaker 1: Tastes nothing like artichoke.

1065
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:22,194
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah, but they're a similar type of food.

1066
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:23,180
Speaker 0: in the end, artichoke dip.

1067
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,820
Speaker 0: I guess artichoke dip is more like spinach dip and less like guacamole.

1068
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,578
Speaker 1: Spinach dip's okay.

1069
00:54:27,842 --> 00:54:28,180
Speaker 1: I like spinach.

1070
00:54:28,282 --> 00:54:28,835
Speaker 0: I like spinach a lot.

1071
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:29,639
Speaker 0: I'll eat spinach.

1072
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,220
Speaker 0: As a kid, I would eat like a quarter pound of spinach dip by myself.

1073
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:43,920
Speaker 1: I try to avoid eating raw spinach and raw kale that has not been cooked because in addition to the bacterial disease E. coli problems of eating just any uncooked vegetable.

1074
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, listen to our friend Pete, cook your lettuce.

1075
00:54:46,023 --> 00:54:46,880
Speaker 1: Cook all vegetables.

1076
00:54:47,883 --> 00:54:49,960
Speaker 1: It has the additional problem of fucking up your stomach.

1077
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:55,939
Speaker 0: So, it doesn't actually, from what I've read, it doesn't actually cause that problem more than a lot of other cooked foods?

1078
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:56,640
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1079
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,020
Speaker 0: The danger's overblown.

1080
00:54:59,184 --> 00:55:00,240
Speaker 1: It's still more than zero.

1081
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:01,099
Speaker 1: My stomach is-.

1082
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,200
Speaker 0: Well, spinach is also really good.

1083
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,138
Speaker 0: Like, I really enjoy it.

1084
00:55:04,183 --> 00:55:04,517
Speaker 1: It's all right.

1085
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,136
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1086
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,820
Speaker 1: Nothing's gotten, really no lettuce can really compare with arugula.

1087
00:55:09,281 --> 00:55:10,480
Speaker 1: Arugula is the king of lettuce.

1088
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,320
Speaker 0: I really, really don't like American cheese because it doesn't taste like anything.

1089
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,040
Speaker 1: Depends, right?

1090
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,040
Speaker 1: So, if you go and you get, say, Kraft Slice at Singles, those taste like nothing.

1091
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:28,980
Speaker 0: Why would you ever eat American cheese when Colby exists, Colby Jack exists, Jack exists, Cheddar exists, Havarti exists?

1092
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:37,540
Speaker 1: If you go to the deli counter and you ask for, say, I guess the minimum American cheese that has flavor would be Land O'Lakes American.

1093
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:48,500
Speaker 0: But I'm saying the highest quality American cheese from the best deli in the world is still mediocre compared to even like an average Cheddar or an average Monterey Jack.

1094
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,260
Speaker 1: You can get good American cheese.

1095
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:51,239
Speaker 1: It has a flavor.

1096
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:58,158
Speaker 0: Well, yes, it's good in respect to American cheese, but the stat for American cheese is a whole caps out real low.

1097
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,059
Speaker 1: No, it's- The best American cheese is worse- It's just a different variety of cheese.

1098
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's flavorless.

1099
00:56:04,782 --> 00:56:09,460
Speaker 1: No, you haven't had a flavorful high quality American cheese that has a flavor.

1100
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:18,180
Speaker 0: If I blindfolded you, I don't think you could tell the difference between good American cheese and really, really shitty like Colby Jack.

1101
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:25,920
Speaker 1: Go get some really shitty Colby Jack and get like, I guess I already said Land O'Lakes American has flavor, so get that.

1102
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,140
Speaker 1: I can tell it apart with my eyes closed.

1103
00:56:29,782 --> 00:56:31,320
Speaker 1: Get yellow or white, it's just food coloring.

1104
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:32,060
Speaker 1: It's not any different.

1105
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,515
Speaker 0: All right, now we've definitely killed enough time, so- Okay.
