1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,359
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday October 8th 2019.

2
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:13,269
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:21,278
Speaker 0: tonight We are talking about a train game in space 2038 tycoons of the asteroid belt.

4
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:25,210
Speaker 0: Can you build a financial empire in space?

5
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,796
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:36,460
Speaker 0: So yesterday I stayed at work a little late because I kind of there's a whole thing going on like a big important project.

7
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:39,520
Speaker 0: And you know, I'm a product manager and I do a lot of things.

8
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:44,860
Speaker 0: It's hard to say what a product manager means because it literally has a different definition every company.

9
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:50,780
Speaker 0: But basically I was asked to make some slides to be able to present something to important people today.

10
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:59,489
Speaker 0: So yesterday I stayed like an hour late and I made these slides because people have realized that making slides is something I am like fucking pro at like.

11
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,260
Speaker 0: I think the two of us could just have a job making slides me and Scott.

12
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:10,839
Speaker 1: If anyone wants to hire me as a professional slide maker that job would be way easier than the job I have now and if you pay me more or as much I mean.

13
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:19,260
Speaker 0: So I stay late and I make these slides because today at like 10 a.m I got to do a really important presentation on these slides.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,919
Speaker 0: So first I gotta figure out what the hell these slides are about.

15
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:22,648
Speaker 0: I gotta I gotta let do my things.

16
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:23,493
Speaker 0: I get my thing ready.

17
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:24,940
Speaker 0: I get up early today.

18
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,046
Speaker 0: I head over to the subway like 8.

19
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:31,343
Speaker 1: Oh, you have to get up early to get to work it by 10.

20
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:34,075
Speaker 0: No, I wanted to get to work a little early to like look at these with.

21
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:34,517
Speaker 0: some of the other.

22
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:38,080
Speaker 0: people are gonna be in The room and like a sanity check and I had to go to a different office.

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,665
Speaker 0: so I wanted but I wanted time.

24
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:40,809
Speaker 0: so I got up a little early.

25
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:57,957
Speaker 0: like have a leisurely morning before I do a big thing and I get on the train at like 815 810 and suddenly the train like runs over something and Stops dead and just sits there not moving in the tunnel with no signal.

26
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,363
Speaker 0: Mmm I was trapped on that train for two full hours Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:18,619
Speaker 0: the worst part about this for me at that point was simply that a lot of people including my boss were like expecting me to show up at this meeting at 10 and 10 o'clock was actually rapidly approaching and I had no way to tell anyone what happened to

28
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:18,740
Speaker 1: me.

29
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:21,000
Speaker 1: Nope So not when you're under the river.

30
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:30,080
Speaker 0: So as far as literally like all these people are converging on this room Like for this important meeting and bit by bit I imagine it's starting to be like where's rim.

31
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:32,886
Speaker 0: Hey, he hasn't even like shown up at work yet.

32
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:34,631
Speaker 0: It's 945.

33
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:35,253
Speaker 0: Where is he?

34
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:36,336
Speaker 0: Did you try calling him?

35
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, I tried calling him.

36
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:39,806
Speaker 0: Can't get through what's going on.

37
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:40,107
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

38
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:40,910
Speaker 0: Has anyone seen him?

39
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:43,179
Speaker 0: Like that is clearly going on.

40
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:57,010
Speaker 0: so eventually after like 40 minutes they get on and they're like, yeah the emergency brake something something something To trail off crack a shit.

41
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:04,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, so eventually Someone walks through the train very slowly and people are of course asking them question.

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:13,913
Speaker 0: Well walks through the train is not quite what happened shoves their way through the train because I was stuck for two hours Standing up crushed against the wall on a completely packed subway train.

43
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,020
Speaker 1: Oh, it was a full train completely full.

44
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,908
Speaker 0: so I'm like crushed against the wall like Rereading the same way.

45
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:22,159
Speaker 0: post story again because I ran out of shit to do on my phone.

46
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:23,947
Speaker 1: Play reason the galaxy hundred.

47
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:26,880
Speaker 0: I finished that book I was reading and I hadn't downloaded a new.

48
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:32,912
Speaker 1: Well, you could never run out of pages into a reading Tale of Genji is not actually on my phone.

49
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:34,760
Speaker 0: I've been reading that on my kindle stakes are made.

50
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:38,459
Speaker 1: Yep, I would have been okay with a Kindle app on your phone and sync it.

51
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:39,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, I should.

52
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,350
Speaker 0: but anyway, I'm gonna do.

53
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,771
Speaker 0: I'm gonna.

54
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:44,079
Speaker 0: tale of Genji is gonna get on my phone tonight.

55
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:57,499
Speaker 0: I know that the next time I'm delayed for two hours with no internet I will have a literally Unlimited amount of entertainment because if I get all the way to the end of the tale of Genji It'll have been so long that I could go back to the beginning having forgotten the details of what happened, correct?

56
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:07,946
Speaker 0: As happens when I watch certain anime over again, so, uh eventually the train Is not gonna move.

57
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,478
Speaker 0: so they announced that rescue trains are coming.

58
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:12,751
Speaker 1: All right Well, it's a very so people don't know.

59
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:17,309
Speaker 0: the seven trace the seven train Train is like the second most important subway in New York.

60
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,940
Speaker 1: There are several trains that go underneath the East River.

61
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,250
Speaker 1: They're also trains that go over the East River on bridges Like the J train just goes on a bridge right.

62
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,002
Speaker 0: all of them goes so deep that it has to go Under.

63
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:30,191
Speaker 0: Roosevelt Island is the deepest subway station.

64
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:32,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, the F train goes under Roosevelt Island.

65
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:34,484
Speaker 1: The N and R trains.

66
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,226
Speaker 1: they have a tunnel.

67
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:38,655
Speaker 1: right now the EC the E train has a tunnel.

68
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:43,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then the Seven the seven train has its own tunnel.

69
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,195
Speaker 0: Well, the seven train has something known as what the Steinway tube the Steinway tube.

70
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:49,500
Speaker 0: It has fucking iron.

71
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:54,717
Speaker 0: It's over a hundred years is a cast iron literal tube.

72
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,465
Speaker 1: Also, those are IRT trains.

73
00:04:57,606 --> 00:05:02,137
Speaker 1: So it's they're narrower right track wise and narrower trains.

74
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:06,092
Speaker 1: then I get the trot track wise but the trains are narrower.

75
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:12,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, right then the BMT and IND trains Because we're gonna talk about a train game.

76
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:13,651
Speaker 1: No, this is relevant.

77
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,940
Speaker 1: and those tubes are super narrow.

78
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:24,440
Speaker 1: They're so narrow that they do not have room to be for a worker to be in the tube working While the train is in the tube.

79
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,351
Speaker 1: It's not like normal tunnels where I give someone a nook to hide in.

80
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:32,480
Speaker 1: it's like no what they want to work on the tunnel Which they have to do a lot because they're old and busted.

81
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:37,500
Speaker 0: New tunnels need to be dug, but we can't afford that because of upstate New York, right?

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,578
Speaker 1: But anyway, so they have to basically stop seven service between Manhattan and Queens or to work on the tunnel.

83
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:48,320
Speaker 1: and also The tunnels are just cast-iron tubes that are constantly leaking water into them.

84
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:49,370
Speaker 0: So there's pumps in there.

85
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:54,540
Speaker 1: right like think about it Even if there's not a hole in it, which there probably are holes and cracks in it for who right somewhere.

86
00:05:54,981 --> 00:06:00,679
Speaker 1: But you know if you take your cast-iron pot, it's sort of like it can get wet.

87
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,840
Speaker 1: It's like it's not a hundred percent non-porous, right?

88
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:07,774
Speaker 1: Water is getting in there all the time.

89
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:12,553
Speaker 1: It's underneath a river and They have to pump that water the fuck out.

90
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,020
Speaker 1: There are pumps running all the time.

91
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,640
Speaker 1: If the pumps of enough pumps fail, yeah, then it will flood and you can't go in there.

92
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:26,909
Speaker 0: The important thing is the NW train and the seven train between the two of them That is millions and millions and millions of people.

93
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,740
Speaker 0: like that is a hugely important subway System those two train two sets of trains.

94
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:41,014
Speaker 0: So the city has a protocol where if one of them is down The other one cannot under any circumstances be down or it is a like.

95
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:43,140
Speaker 0: it is a ridiculous disaster for the city.

96
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, man, everyone on each.

97
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:48,269
Speaker 1: Yeah 100% capacity.

98
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,838
Speaker 1: you have everyone on EF train.

99
00:06:49,959 --> 00:07:00,120
Speaker 0: Yep So the seven being down for like three and a half Like that train being down probably caused tens of millions of dollars in economic damage to New York City.

100
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,368
Speaker 0: Yep, like it was a shit was a big disaster.

101
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:05,780
Speaker 0: So eventually a rescue train comes in from the front.

102
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:07,451
Speaker 1: Yeah, they can't come in from the side.

103
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:07,813
Speaker 1: Yep.

104
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:16,360
Speaker 0: It's well, it's a Because there are two tracks in this tiny - yeah, and we were kind of near Grand Central like we were approaching Grand Central.

105
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:27,100
Speaker 0: So they brought a train from the front and they just rolled it up and eventually like they opened doors They made a platform between the two and put up all these tarps and then they made everyone walk from the train.

106
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,740
Speaker 0: We were on forward to this new train and once they got everyone that train they're gonna take us in the Grand Central.

107
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:36,867
Speaker 0: I don't know if you understand how long New York City subway trains are.

108
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:40,500
Speaker 0: it took like a half hour to get everyone to walk into this other train.

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,405
Speaker 1: Well, you only need half the people to walk into the because you can bring another Half.

110
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:47,269
Speaker 1: had another half right but you know But you I imagine you were in.

111
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,646
Speaker 1: if you're in the front even in the front car You're in the front car.

112
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:55,900
Speaker 1: You still have to walk the entire length Of the new rescue train to get to its front front car.

113
00:07:56,101 --> 00:08:00,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, well was rear is now gonna be front car when it moves the other direction.

114
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:18,922
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway so we walk up eventually and then this this rescue train is gonna go and it starts to move a little bit and then It fucks up and the emergency brake kicks in and it gets stuck like five feet away people.

115
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,318
Speaker 0: I Said my favorite phrase in the world Thank You New York, okay.

116
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:27,049
Speaker 0: So eventually the train like we get into the station.

117
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,994
Speaker 0: It's like 101.

118
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:35,913
Speaker 0: So of course my phone goes apeshit now And I call my bosses and everything and they're like, yeah the meetings about to start.

119
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:48,340
Speaker 0: so I run to my office which is not where the meeting is log into the video conference out of breath and I do the presentation remotely while someone else presents the slides in the room and that was super difficult and stressful.

120
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:51,640
Speaker 0: I couldn't even hear what any was saying in the room because the microphone in the room was bad.

121
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:58,949
Speaker 0: So people were asking me questions and I was guessing what they had asked and I guess I answered every question correctly Despite not actually hearing any words.

122
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,314
Speaker 0: They said except a few nouns.

123
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:00,656
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

124
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:01,600
Speaker 0: Everything went fine.

125
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:06,596
Speaker 0: I didn't actually learn until later when I was talking to Scott randomly that what had happened was the train.

126
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:11,631
Speaker 0: the car I was in Ran somebody over and that thing I felt was the crushing.

127
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:13,537
Speaker 0: Yep, and those tarps were said.

128
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:14,299
Speaker 0: no one saw it.

129
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,199
Speaker 1: There were tarps under the train.

130
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:22,002
Speaker 0: well They put tarps up as we had to walk from one train to the other train and they put like tarps up that They were.

131
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:30,841
Speaker 0: all the workers were implying it was to make it sure we couldn't like fall out the side when we because we had To jump across the bike from one train to the other there was like a two-foot gap We don't?

132
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:34,096
Speaker 1: they usually just take a metal sheet and use it as a bridge.

133
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:34,759
Speaker 0: They didn't have that.

134
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,267
Speaker 0: yet They waited until every.

135
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:38,681
Speaker 1: those aren't those like included in every train car Like.

136
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:43,520
Speaker 0: there's just like a secret compartment a metro north and those are for side to side.

137
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:45,187
Speaker 1: Train rescue could still use it.

138
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:46,493
Speaker 0: Yeah, they did.

139
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:47,316
Speaker 0: we had to jump across.

140
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,120
Speaker 0: It's like two-foot gap.

141
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,283
Speaker 1: What if someone couldn't jump?

142
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:50,688
Speaker 0: everyone who couldn't jump?

143
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:54,098
Speaker 0: they waited until everyone walked across which was the vast majority of people.

144
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:54,560
Speaker 0: and then?

145
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:04,249
Speaker 0: MJP workers like went and Yeah, they individually helped everyone else one by one, okay So that was my Odyssey this morning.

146
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:05,153
Speaker 0: All right.

147
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:09,127
Speaker 1: Well, my opening bit is way less exciting And let way less unusual.

148
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,837
Speaker 1: So I've been trying to buy some jean.

149
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:19,190
Speaker 0: Oh So Uniqlo they don't they don't have the good Uniqlo jeans anymore, but it's like, okay Well, but that's the thing is the Uniqlo jeans.

150
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,620
Speaker 1: I got the last time I got Uniqlo jeans, right?

151
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:29,880
Speaker 1: They were you know, right size right comfiness level, but they were lacking in the durability and lasting department.

152
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:32,688
Speaker 1: They literally broke.

153
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:35,014
Speaker 1: You know, I was like the old Uniqlo jeans.

154
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,839
Speaker 0: I still have one pair of those left.

155
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,728
Speaker 1: I was like Even cheapo Levi's, they're not the comfiest.

156
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:43,036
Speaker 1: They're not the best fitting but they don't break.

157
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:47,200
Speaker 1: They're super strong Yeah, so I switched by rectification.

158
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,580
Speaker 0: I gave up all my jeans are just basically spandex and I just replaced them every few years because they wear out.

159
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,256
Speaker 1: Well, I was recommended to go get American Eagle jeans.

160
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:58,380
Speaker 0: So I did right But they're really durable.

161
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:05,760
Speaker 1: well so what happened was is I got them and they were way comfy and They're the right size and they're stretchy and they look good.

162
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:10,850
Speaker 1: But what happened is Some of the ones I got right.

163
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:15,755
Speaker 1: they were like 32 30 The inseam was 32, which was correct.

164
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:16,560
Speaker 1: when they were new.

165
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:22,419
Speaker 1: I go with the 34 because and they they shrunk a little bit and then they became a little high watery.

166
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:24,810
Speaker 0: Oh, the high water is the worst, right?

167
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,816
Speaker 1: So then I tried some 34 But that was too long.

168
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:37,123
Speaker 0: So my Strategy I wear 30 34 so 30 inch waist even though it's a little big but it's hard to get 29 34.

169
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:39,031
Speaker 0: So I get 30 24 or 30 34 and I just roll up the cuffs.

170
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:42,406
Speaker 0: I do the style of.

171
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:43,833
Speaker 0: I've rolled up cuffs in all my jeans, right?

172
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:54,060
Speaker 1: So anyway, so then There's a company called Madewell, which is owned by J crew and in the city all their stores only sell ladies clothes and they specialize in denim.

173
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,084
Speaker 1: They like denim bar.

174
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:57,997
Speaker 0: So I'll admit straight up some of the G. a lot of my jeans are women's jeans.

175
00:11:58,037 --> 00:11:58,720
Speaker 0: guys fit me better.

176
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:04,511
Speaker 1: So on their website, however The Madewell website they have man jeans.

177
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,217
Speaker 0: Oh, but not in the store.

178
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:07,140
Speaker 1: So yeah, right.

179
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:10,860
Speaker 1: So I ordered their man jeans on their website, which were expensive.

180
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:16,099
Speaker 1: But Amanda got something was like, oh these are worth all the money's they're so great I'm intrigued now.

181
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,800
Speaker 1: So I ordered them from the website and I right but but the ones I ordered they were way too big.

182
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:25,659
Speaker 0: Oh, so I went like are the numbers just wrong?

183
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:36,136
Speaker 1: They were like they were super long and super fat in the butt and like the butt was like I had like a little Parachute, but yeah, that's partly why increasingly I just wear spandex.

184
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:37,240
Speaker 0: that looks like jeans.

185
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:42,020
Speaker 1: Oh, so then I apparently the thing was is you can return those at their store.

186
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:43,780
Speaker 1: So I went to their store and it took two minutes.

187
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,920
Speaker 1: I gave them the jeans that came in the mail and they gave me my money back.

188
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:51,636
Speaker 1: So then I'm like, you know what I heard about this store, right?

189
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,600
Speaker 1: I work in like Soho.

190
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,287
Speaker 1: It's like the fancy fashion II district.

191
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:57,500
Speaker 1: we're like ultra high-end shit where you know, rich people buy stuff.

192
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,753
Speaker 1: I'm like, let's just go they're not gonna kick me out.

193
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,099
Speaker 1: I'll just go to the rich people store.

194
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:07,499
Speaker 1: Try on some rich people jeans and not buy them and see if it's or is it worth it to buy?

195
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:09,062
Speaker 1: $250 jeans.

196
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:11,493
Speaker 0: So the last time I did that was gloves.

197
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:16,272
Speaker 0: I went to the fancy fancy place in Midtown There's like ten years ago and I was like, what are fancy gloves like?

198
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:18,460
Speaker 0: and I tried on some leather gloves.

199
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,725
Speaker 0: They were like they were like butter.

200
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,733
Speaker 0: and then I thought these are what like $400.

201
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:21,954
Speaker 0: All right.

202
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:25,513
Speaker 0: No, they were $4,000 and I walked out of that store.

203
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:31,314
Speaker 1: So I went to this store at the rag and bone where the jeans are $250 each.

204
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:33,440
Speaker 1: right expecting not to buy any jeans.

205
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:34,960
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't buy any jeans?

206
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, not paying $250 for one gene.

207
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:43,212
Speaker 0: fuck that I would if they were durable and perfect if I can wear them for a decade.

208
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:44,295
Speaker 0: the play was comfortable.

209
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:51,960
Speaker 1: place was very much Shiloh warm sirs crack pipe dude wanted to like bring me water while I was in the dressing room.

210
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:56,929
Speaker 1: Right, it was often glove place.

211
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,377
Speaker 0: they followed me around like they thought it was a shoplifter because I didn't look fancy enough, right?

212
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:04,367
Speaker 1: So The thing was is for $250.

213
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:10,346
Speaker 1: It's like all right, maybe what you know, if this gene will last me 15 years, I mean I

214
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:14,420
Speaker 0: bought a thousand dollar computer chair a long time ago, and I'm still using the right

215
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:23,726
Speaker 1: Right, so and like if this gene well is the most perfect fitting gene in the universe, right and will last me a super long Time and that's fucking great.

216
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:26,216
Speaker 1: Then I might consider buying it.

217
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:33,620
Speaker 1: It was on sale Yeah, and so I go to try on a whole bunch, right and in I got there.

218
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,305
Speaker 1: They don't give you lengths on these.

219
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:41,585
Speaker 1: they're only with what there's only with and they're all about 34s at least what they say.

220
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:45,455
Speaker 1: and then if you need shorter then you can tailor them.

221
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:54,120
Speaker 1: you can you go get them shortened And the guy actually suggested we will shorten them for you for $30, but he's like you should just go somewhere else.

222
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,369
Speaker 1: It will be cheaper and faster.

223
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:56,800
Speaker 1: All right good on him, right?

224
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:02,140
Speaker 1: Cuz he says that yeah, it takes us like three weeks to do it and we charge 30 bucks each.

225
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:08,220
Speaker 1: But basically they just make all their genes Slightly longer than at any average person would need them and then expect you to shorten them.

226
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Speaker 0: See I choose to do the new style of always get 34s and just roll them up, right?

227
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,460
Speaker 1: But yeah, so the I got there was and also their genes run big which I'm like if they're expensive fancy rich people ones.

228
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,764
Speaker 1: Shouldn't they just be exactly right?

229
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:22,627
Speaker 1: Why are they right?

230
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,454
Speaker 0: But I took for that.

231
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:25,678
Speaker 0: you need tailored genes.

232
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:27,424
Speaker 0: where they cut They make them for you.

233
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:27,825
Speaker 1: Yeah.

234
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:36,490
Speaker 1: Anyway, I got 32s in two different colors, but basically the same exact gene and one of them was a lot like Different size than the other.

235
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:43,840
Speaker 1: what it was like I'm like feels like they were not I was expecting like perfect amazing comfort and whatnot.

236
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:49,740
Speaker 0: No, cuz like when I got I got a few tailored shirts for like fancy occasions and they were expensive but not crazy expensive.

237
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:55,611
Speaker 0: They were expensive but they fit Perfectly, I mean these were like so perfectly.

238
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:56,354
Speaker 0: It's weird.

239
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:57,720
Speaker 0: I'm like Finn's grass sword.

240
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:05,689
Speaker 1: We were they were nice jeans and if I would have gotten them tailored to the right length, they would have fit all Perfectly as a gene is gonna fit.

241
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,854
Speaker 0: but for you could.

242
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:11,394
Speaker 1: but they were not Three times as good as a $90 or you know, whatever.

243
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,826
Speaker 1: They were not like with steaks.

244
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:15,970
Speaker 0: a $10 steak ain't that great.

245
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,552
Speaker 0: a $20 takes pretty good.

246
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:17,094
Speaker 0: a $40 steak is great.

247
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:22,117
Speaker 0: A $400 steak is only slightly better than a $40 day, right?

248
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,552
Speaker 1: The $250 gene was not three times better than the $75.

249
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:31,753
Speaker 1: You find me a steak Better 85, I don't know.

250
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:38,040
Speaker 0: find me a steak That is ten times better than a $40 steak and I will pay any amount of money for that steak.

251
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:39,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it doesn't exist.

252
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:42,956
Speaker 1: So I do not recommend the $250 gene.

253
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:58,527
Speaker 1: What I did is I went back to the the Madewell one, right the ladies gene place Yeah, and I just went back to the website after getting my refund And it has ordered a smaller size because I can just return those again, too If they're not any good right

254
00:16:58,567 --> 00:16:59,473
Speaker 0: also for that price.

255
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:00,540
Speaker 1: that doesn't work out.

256
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,864
Speaker 1: I'll try some other place.

257
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:09,359
Speaker 0: how much do actually just straight-up tailored jeans cost then compared to these like Multi-hundred-dollar not tailored jeans.

258
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:13,733
Speaker 1: I mean I could have just bought those $250 jeans and had them shorten them and that would know.

259
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:20,657
Speaker 1: tailored means they like measure Multiple parts of your body and every other part of the gene was pretty much exactly right as long, you know.

260
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,673
Speaker 1: But not were it wasn't as good as the price.

261
00:17:24,914 --> 00:17:26,520
Speaker 0: I got the problem because I run so much.

262
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,432
Speaker 0: I got really big gams and very few jeans.

263
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:31,220
Speaker 0: So tiny waist and big game.

264
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:45,994
Speaker 1: well, so what you got to do if you got that is they have athletic cut jeans, which basically are this like extreme tapering situation Which is good if you're like a hockey player and you have a giant ass and giant thighs and like, you know Normal-sized normal-sized calf.

265
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:50,549
Speaker 1: Yeah It's actually a relatively recent development.

266
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,938
Speaker 1: it used to just be like skinny slim straight.

267
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,359
Speaker 1: now There's like the athletic cut is a relatively recent thing.

268
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:59,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is for people with gigantic thighs and asses.

269
00:18:00,422 --> 00:18:03,516
Speaker 0: The other problem I have though is for any of you have met me in person.

270
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:07,887
Speaker 0: I have Freakishly tiny wrists and ankles.

271
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:11,378
Speaker 1: I have tiny wrists and also long arms.

272
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:15,919
Speaker 1: Yeah while I was in there was like coats in the store and I was checking him out and the.

273
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:23,120
Speaker 1: I saw a really nice coat at another store recently and when I looked inside the coat, it was four thousand or two thousand dollars.

274
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:26,495
Speaker 1: And I looked at a coat in this store and I was like, oh that looks like that $2,000 coat.

275
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:30,208
Speaker 1: and I was like Oh, it's only one thousand dollars.

276
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,034
Speaker 1: I guess I still won't buy this.

277
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:33,960
Speaker 0: I saved a thousand dollars, right?

278
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,079
Speaker 1: but I tried it on and Basically the medium my arms came way out the sleeve and the large was like, you know a balloon.

279
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:43,640
Speaker 0: see that's.

280
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,633
Speaker 0: That's what I don't get when if you're paying that much money for something Better be tailored like.

281
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:50,520
Speaker 0: if it's off the rack.

282
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:53,500
Speaker 1: It should be cheap anyway, and then I was in another store.

283
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,620
Speaker 1: I was just passing by and they had a similar coat and it was like, oh only five hundred dollars.

284
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:00,452
Speaker 1: Not buying this money.

285
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:08,570
Speaker 0: I Remember when I was a kid, I got a $90 jacket once And I wore that jacket until it was just threads.

286
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:11,280
Speaker 0: I bought I got a leather integrated around me.

287
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,456
Speaker 1: I got a leather jacket suede leather.

288
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:13,900
Speaker 0: I love that.

289
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,640
Speaker 1: I got a leather jacket in high school from like this leather good store in the mall.

290
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:25,024
Speaker 1: That was way good at least at the time and then the zipper got busted and then I had someone fix the zipper But it was still busted.

291
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:28,860
Speaker 1: and then I just never went and got the zipper fixed again.

292
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:33,529
Speaker 1: And then by the time I was like, oh, you know I should go and get the zipper fixed on that fucking thing.

293
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:40,963
Speaker 1: and I went and I put it on and I was like Wow, this jacket from the 90s looks way derpy Fixed.

294
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:43,215
Speaker 1: it's sort of big and poofy and derpy looking.

295
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:46,648
Speaker 1: Wow Why did I think this is cool when it was new?

296
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:53,589
Speaker 1: and then I gave donated it at the coat drive at the holiday season After like 15 to 20 years after I got it.

297
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:56,360
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of really big news.

298
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:07,032
Speaker 0: we're really only going to talk about one thing before we get into our space train game review, but briefly if you didn't notice the Professional hockey season has started while the NHL season.

299
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,100
Speaker 1: There's a lot of other professional hockey in the world.

300
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:12,013
Speaker 0: Yeah But this is the only hockey we're at.

301
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:21,894
Speaker 0: at the conclusion of the season Some team will have the right to hold Lord Stanley's Cup mmm, and There's no like lockout like all that's like.

302
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:22,680
Speaker 0: didn't none of that happen?

303
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,200
Speaker 0: We're getting just normal hockey and I continue to be a fan of the undefeated New York Rangers.

304
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:30,775
Speaker 1: Oh what happened to your and your your Detroit team?

305
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:31,800
Speaker 0: I've lived in New York.

306
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,546
Speaker 1: You disloyal person.

307
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,760
Speaker 1: I think if I think if I move to Detroit, I would be like go wings.

308
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:41,717
Speaker 0: You know if I live I moved to Detroit for 10 years.

309
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:45,635
Speaker 1: I would probably really if I move to Detroit and live there the rest of my life.

310
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:48,806
Speaker 1: Do you think I would ever Want the Red Wings to win?

311
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:52,200
Speaker 0: but Scott, what about the people who are born in Buffalo?

312
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,319
Speaker 0: You got to give him an escape.

313
00:20:54,561 --> 00:21:05,693
Speaker 1: you mean my co-worker who is from Rochester and Was like Scott taking me to go see the Sabres and I was like, okay I can see the Red Wings play in New York like at best twice a year.

314
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:10,154
Speaker 1: or I can mean once Oh, I guess you could see them against the Islanders.

315
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:14,633
Speaker 0: Yeah That's the level of desperation it would take.

316
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:15,740
Speaker 1: you can see them playing as the Devils.

317
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:20,280
Speaker 0: Yeah I'd rather go see them play against the Islanders.

318
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:24,115
Speaker 0: But or I can see the Rangers play all the time with a half season.

319
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:26,423
Speaker 0: So mmm I live in New York.

320
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:29,533
Speaker 0: But anyway the big news and it's all still developing.

321
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:42,960
Speaker 0: So I want to send some context for this because China has gone after Both Activision Blizzard and the NBA in a very short span of time and These situations are both evolving kind of rapidly.

322
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,755
Speaker 0: So I want to sort of set the stage by explaining something people don't realize.

323
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:48,100
Speaker 0: you might assume you talk about this on Twitter.

324
00:21:49,103 --> 00:22:13,468
Speaker 0: The video game industry and to a large extent the tabletop board game industry in the entire world Regardless of whether or not they talk about it follow most of the Chinese censorship rules Because the reality is you either sell your games in China if you're a big company or manufacture your games in China if you are most tabletop game publishers or You're done like.

325
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:15,158
Speaker 0: you can't make money like that's how the world is.

326
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:27,380
Speaker 0: People whether we like it or not whether we talk about it or not They tend to follow all of China's rules to avoid Having to deal with the Chinese government giving you shit or seizing your games or denying you access to the market.

327
00:22:28,002 --> 00:22:28,704
Speaker 0: Like that's the thing.

328
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:33,060
Speaker 0: that's why you tend to not see Taiwanese flags in any video games.

329
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:33,681
Speaker 1: hmm

330
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:52,800
Speaker 0: other countries pull similar shit like India does the same thing with if you show Kashmir the wrong way on a map, but Because of economic reasons big companies don't really care if they can sell their games in India But they care a lot if they can sell their games in China because most of these companies Might be in trouble if they couldn't sell games in China financially.

331
00:22:53,422 --> 00:23:02,251
Speaker 0: In fact in many cases they might be liable for damages to their shareholders because of ridiculous and possibly out-of-date fiduciary responsibility Rules, I am NOT a lawyer.

332
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:06,868
Speaker 0: This is not investment advice but That is the context for this.

333
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:12,345
Speaker 0: Blizzard got called out because China Effectively forced them to do this.

334
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:17,822
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I got called out because the NBA I don't know what's gonna happen with the NBA All right.

335
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:18,707
Speaker 1: So here's so here.

336
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:20,920
Speaker 1: you didn't talk about what actually happened.

337
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:23,708
Speaker 0: Here's the details and you read these stories for the like.

338
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:26,677
Speaker 0: full details cuz we're not news we're commentary right.

339
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,002
Speaker 1: so in the NBA Right.

340
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,459
Speaker 1: I think is the owner of the Rockets I believe the king so right?

341
00:23:32,822 --> 00:23:34,268
Speaker 1: Or is the coach of the owner?

342
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:36,919
Speaker 1: I forget I don't pay too much attention to the Houston Rockets, right?

343
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:42,504
Speaker 1: The point is the dude made a pro Hong Kong Comment right.

344
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:45,732
Speaker 1: and then Houston Rockets are the most popular.

345
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,680
Speaker 1: and not only is basketball super popular in China, right?

346
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:55,744
Speaker 1: The Houston Rockets are the most popular NBA team in China because that's a team Yao Ming played for a lot of sponsorship deals in China.

347
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:57,120
Speaker 1: right Yao Ming is a big duty.

348
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:58,120
Speaker 1: It's like yeah.

349
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,320
Speaker 1: You remember the super tall Chinese dude who came and played basketball for a little bit and then went back to China.

350
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:05,013
Speaker 1: He basically runs basketball in China.

351
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:05,335
Speaker 1: Now.

352
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:06,420
Speaker 1: He's a big deal that guy.

353
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:08,495
Speaker 1: But yeah.

354
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,520
Speaker 1: But because of this comment China's like well, we're not gonna broadcast any Rockets games.

355
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:17,300
Speaker 1: In fact now, we're just now gonna broadcast any NBA preseason.

356
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:21,137
Speaker 0: This is the company that streams NBA in China is ten cents.

357
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:32,273
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm The same company that's holding seems like the ball seems like ten cent only exists to distribute Western things and make partnerships with Western companies to do Chinese thing.

358
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:32,533
Speaker 1: pretty.

359
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,378
Speaker 1: it seems like that's all that company does.

360
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:37,514
Speaker 0: pretty sure ten cent Made that like mobile Call of Duty game to sell in China.

361
00:24:37,735 --> 00:24:41,540
Speaker 0: There is a Like it or not home video game companies.

362
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:41,821
Speaker 0: Like.

363
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:47,340
Speaker 0: the only way to really make money is to make mobile versions of your IP and sell that in China through ten cent.

364
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:48,043
Speaker 0: Like.

365
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,047
Speaker 0: that's how you make money.

366
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,120
Speaker 1: It's like every time it's like, oh, yeah, we're gonna work with ten cent to do stuff.

367
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:53,168
Speaker 1: Okay, whatever.

368
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:53,753
Speaker 1: It's so.

369
00:24:53,773 --> 00:25:02,660
Speaker 0: the Chinese basketball Relationship with the Rockets like Merchandise is no longer allowed to be sold on Alibaba like all sorts of shit went down.

370
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:05,334
Speaker 1: So now the NBA has to skirt this line.

371
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:14,900
Speaker 1: It's like, okay Well, we don't want to condemn this guy for saying something that's a right Yeah, but be in America where you have freedom of speech, right?

372
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,099
Speaker 1: But see if we don't do anything about this, we're gonna lose a fuck ton of money.

373
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:24,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were like to the point that it might be a problem for the NBA.

374
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,421
Speaker 0: Right.

375
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,625
Speaker 1: The NBA is long-term.

376
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:30,160
Speaker 1: plans are basically to like have real NBA teams in China and make it a real thing.

377
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:41,640
Speaker 1: Oh and before we you know Worldwide League and that this is there's one person making one off-hand comment Can like screw that whole thing like a bill a multi-billion dollar comment.

378
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:46,835
Speaker 0: The NHL actually has a similar strategy because hockey is getting popular in China.

379
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:51,884
Speaker 1: There was a. there was a CWHL women's hockey team in China All right.

380
00:25:52,105 --> 00:25:59,193
Speaker 0: There's also you've noticed in a lot of Rangers games and other hockey games You'll actually see various Chinese firms buying ads in the games.

381
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:01,040
Speaker 0: Oftentimes those ads are even in Chinese.

382
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:02,184
Speaker 0: Like.

383
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:05,408
Speaker 1: I don't think hockey's that big in China Yeah, but it's it's really big.

384
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:11,640
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell if you're a sports league You're trying to make you know, Chinese people care about your thing.

385
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,440
Speaker 0: I'm not an expert but as best I can tell hockey is really big among upper-class people in certain parts of China.

386
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:19,451
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm sure healthy people like cocky there.

387
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,060
Speaker 1: I mean wealthy people around the world.

388
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:26,120
Speaker 0: I mean hockey is a very like wealthy person sport for a lot of you have to be healthy to play hockey.

389
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:27,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need an ice rink.

390
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:29,635
Speaker 1: You need skates and all this other shit.

391
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:30,338
Speaker 1: It's not like soccer.

392
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:30,900
Speaker 1: Anyone can play.

393
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:39,023
Speaker 1: Anyway, so with Hearthstone and Blizzard what happened was this is dude Blitz something.

394
00:26:39,043 --> 00:26:39,566
Speaker 1: What's his name?

395
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:41,915
Speaker 0: Oh, this dude is my hero.

396
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:42,940
Speaker 1: Yeah blitz chung, right?

397
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,753
Speaker 1: So this is a Hearthstone guy that I had known.

398
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:45,660
Speaker 1: I just knew his name.

399
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:47,899
Speaker 1: I knew he was a Hearthstone player, but I didn't know anything else about him.

400
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,010
Speaker 1: And basically he was at a Hearthstone tournament.

401
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,336
Speaker 1: I think did he win me?

402
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,020
Speaker 1: I think he might have won.

403
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:53,604
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

404
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,780
Speaker 0: he won a match in the Grand Masters, right?

405
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,386
Speaker 1: He won a match and then there was a an interview and at the interview He was just like yeah Hong Kong.

406
00:27:01,446 --> 00:27:02,028
Speaker 0: Whoo.

407
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:13,340
Speaker 0: He said the thing that is like super illegal to say in China Yeah, liberate Hong Kong revolution of our time and he wore goggles and a face mask in solidarity with the protesters, right?

408
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,437
Speaker 1: He's basically like yeah, let's go Hong Kong you know with his which is what I recommend pretty much anyone do.

409
00:27:19,457 --> 00:27:25,000
Speaker 1: if You manage to get put on a stage and you get a mic with enough ears, right?

410
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:27,169
Speaker 1: Do not take that for granted.

411
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,000
Speaker 1: don't use it what it's intended to be used for right?

412
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:35,187
Speaker 1: It's like if you win an Oscar don't go up and be like, oh, thanks so-and-so you should do it.

413
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:41,836
Speaker 1: many other people have done and use your Moments of nationally broadcast television in the most effective way possible.

414
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:44,345
Speaker 0: Yep, right Their health care.

415
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:48,540
Speaker 1: if you win an Olympic gold medal, you know, go ahead and raise up your fist.

416
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,848
Speaker 1: You only got one shot.

417
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:50,332
Speaker 1: Don't wait.

418
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:51,560
Speaker 1: You got this opportunity.

419
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:53,105
Speaker 1: Don't fucking waste it.

420
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,675
Speaker 1: and anyone who doesn't waste it you're badass.

421
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:56,397
Speaker 1: I root for you.

422
00:27:56,618 --> 00:27:57,060
Speaker 1: good job.

423
00:27:58,361 --> 00:28:14,187
Speaker 1: So anyway, this guy wisely did not waste his opportunity while many many people were watching him on Twitch and other places around the world And then as a result blizzard a Denied him all his winnings from hearthstone this year.

424
00:28:14,348 --> 00:28:21,503
Speaker 0: the reef of all the things blizzard did are partly because ten cent owns a chunk of blizzard and Blizzard isn't just blizzard.

425
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:23,207
Speaker 0: blizzard is Activision blizzard.

426
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:25,914
Speaker 0: Activision uses ten cent to make money in China.

427
00:28:26,034 --> 00:28:28,420
Speaker 1: Yep, and he's banned from hearthstone.

428
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,152
Speaker 1: and Now what's happening is blizzards between a rock and a hard place.

429
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:36,078
Speaker 1: because on the one hand, right?

430
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:48,999
Speaker 0: If they don't do this they're gonna get like all the blizzard games could just get booted out of China like literally half the overwatch league will disappear and Activism blizzard may not even be able to sustain the league anymore, right?

431
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:59,086
Speaker 1: And also on the other hand If you look at say the blizzard reddit the hearthstone reddit any of the right if they do this They're gonna lose the American team.

432
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:06,100
Speaker 1: even even blizzard play at blizzard employees were covering up You know the the slogans at the blizzard headquarters.

433
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:08,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, that say like, you know every.

434
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:09,980
Speaker 1: you know, what does it say?

435
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,039
Speaker 1: Every voice is to be listened to or something every every voice should be heard something like that.

436
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were.

437
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,280
Speaker 1: basically it's on the American side.

438
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:19,546
Speaker 1: Everyone's just like.

439
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:20,712
Speaker 1: well, I'm done with hearthstone.

440
00:29:20,913 --> 00:29:21,355
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

441
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:27,460
Speaker 1: Fuck this Fuck blizzard not playing your games anymore deleting my blizzard people are deleting their battle net accounts.

442
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,987
Speaker 1: All right, just like oh fuck that the end.

443
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:30,930
Speaker 1: Yep.

444
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:41,020
Speaker 1: So, you know on the what you see it even Politicians in America right even bad Republican ones are say I end the Democratic ones.

445
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:47,353
Speaker 1: I saw at least one Republican and one Democratic senator Commenting on like even blizzard specifically just MBA.

446
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:52,731
Speaker 0: when the US government says the right thing It's either the Democrats or the Democrats and the Republicans.

447
00:29:52,812 --> 00:29:53,976
Speaker 0: It's never just the Republicans.

448
00:29:53,996 --> 00:29:55,140
Speaker 0: They've never said the right thing.

449
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,515
Speaker 0: They don't say the right thing on their own But but they both agree that this is trouble.

450
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:06,559
Speaker 1: They're basically like yeah China uses its threat of you know, cutting you off from their market, right?

451
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,659
Speaker 1: to control your behavior.

452
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:14,798
Speaker 0: And that is not worse because most tabletop games are manufactured in China.

453
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:15,960
Speaker 1: China has a history.

454
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,462
Speaker 1: Well, we did.

455
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,015
Speaker 1: I don't know if we did a news on it, but there was a call.

456
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:19,900
Speaker 1: He's that game.

457
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:23,343
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a call of Cthulhu Supplement.

458
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:27,240
Speaker 1: I think that was being printed in China and I think I had the issue with the maps.

459
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:28,537
Speaker 1: I think we did do news on this.

460
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:30,491
Speaker 1: It had map issues.

461
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:35,213
Speaker 1: right with regards to the you know Those islands that China cares about for I don't know fucking reason.

462
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:35,997
Speaker 1: just get over it.

463
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:37,900
Speaker 1: Jesus Christ anyway.

464
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:43,938
Speaker 1: As a result they that RPG was not ever shipped to the u.s.

465
00:30:45,102 --> 00:30:47,088
Speaker 1: And all the copies are just burned in China.

466
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:49,777
Speaker 0: and I will while I am not at liberty to give specifics.

467
00:30:49,797 --> 00:31:06,079
Speaker 0: I Have been told of specific instances and seen specific Guidelines that were disseminated non publicly given to various publishers at various times over the years not recently This is often like three or four years ago that basically said follow these rules or we will fuck you over.

468
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:12,447
Speaker 0: Like you can't get around this stuff unless you Completely produce your game outside of China

469
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:13,891
Speaker 1: and don't sell it to anyone in China

470
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:24,052
Speaker 0: or at least if people play your game in China you don't rely on that revenue and you do not interact with the Chinese government and you do not care if the Chinese government allows you To continue to sell there or not.

471
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:30,500
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm honestly, I think that Non Chinese game companies have a moral imperative to not sell their games in China.

472
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:34,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I think China does not get to censor the world.

473
00:31:34,456 --> 00:31:34,597
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

474
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:35,119
Speaker 1: That's right.

475
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:37,451
Speaker 0: Us has done a lot of shitty things.

476
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:39,019
Speaker 0: Our government is completely fucked up.

477
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:47,296
Speaker 0: But the one thing that we've almost got right is that when it comes to creative expression there's freedom to make creative things

478
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:48,020
Speaker 1: and

479
00:31:49,041 --> 00:32:02,859
Speaker 0: The fact that the entire video game industry of the world has been basically following Chinese censorship laws Without even telling you this is not something new This is just this all being exposed to you now because they can't hide it anymore.

480
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:04,666
Speaker 0: Esports is a global thing.

481
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:05,650
Speaker 0: There are Chinese fans.

482
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:06,875
Speaker 0: There are American fans.

483
00:32:07,096 --> 00:32:08,180
Speaker 0: They're all in the same league.

484
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:10,267
Speaker 0: One side is gonna give in this.

485
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,872
Speaker 0: there's no compromise possible here.

486
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:15,521
Speaker 0: I don't think and I don't know how this is gonna play out Mm-hmm.

487
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:27,005
Speaker 0: I'm gonna keep playing overwatch because I really like overwatch but at the same time I Think blizzard should abandon the Chinese market and if that destroys the overwatch league as much as I love the overwatch league So be it.

488
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:29,800
Speaker 1: Well, I think you know, there's a. there's a certain thing going on, right?

489
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:33,133
Speaker 0: I own a lot of blizzard stock.

490
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:36,307
Speaker 0: I would be harmed myself personally and financially.

491
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:42,885
Speaker 1: you do something if you do something that China Chinese want.

492
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:44,972
Speaker 1: China wants and you don't sell it there.

493
00:32:45,153 --> 00:32:46,156
Speaker 1: They just sort of copy you.

494
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:49,124
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and So it's sort of like.

495
00:32:49,164 --> 00:32:52,094
Speaker 1: well, I can't really threaten them by denying them this thing.

496
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:53,418
Speaker 1: They'll just copy it.

497
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:53,780
Speaker 1: It's like.

498
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:56,720
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, China kicks out the NBA.

499
00:32:56,961 --> 00:33:01,080
Speaker 1: It's like cuz they got their own league right, you know, but it's like.

500
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:11,053
Speaker 1: But are the people in China isn't there still some element of them being like hey You're denying us the best basketball players on earth, right?

501
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:14,849
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, I like my Chinese league that I go to I like going to see RIT hockey.

502
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, but but I Exist.

503
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:22,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you banned me from seeing the NHL, I'll be fucking pissed.

504
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:24,018
Speaker 1: It made this KHL teams.

505
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:24,560
Speaker 1: They make money.

506
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,202
Speaker 1: They have fans.

507
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:27,992
Speaker 1: this, you know Finnish teams and Swiss Swedish teams.

508
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:30,080
Speaker 1: is this leagues of hockey around the world?

509
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:37,807
Speaker 1: You know the soccer leagues around the world, but imagine if like, okay, you know, you're in South America, you can see.

510
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:41,660
Speaker 1: you know, the American cups all the soccer that happens South America.

511
00:33:41,942 --> 00:33:46,339
Speaker 1: we're not gonna let you watch World Cup or Europa League or Premier League.

512
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:47,904
Speaker 1: We banned those.

513
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:49,168
Speaker 0: it's like oh, there's the news.

514
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:52,438
Speaker 0: Apparently the team's considering firing Daryl Maury over this.

515
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,219
Speaker 1: Yep That's the NBA guy yeah, but anyway.

516
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:07,794
Speaker 1: So it's like there must be some amount of pressure that can be had from denying China Something that they can't necessarily copy.

517
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:15,614
Speaker 1: They can't copy LeBron They can have basketball But they can't have the world's best basketball that we that is the United States thing.

518
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:23,639
Speaker 0: short of a multi-decade Effort to build up a pipeline like all the things that make basketball players in America possible, right?

519
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:34,010
Speaker 1: That's a long-term investment and it would take a long time for the Chinese Basketball League to produce a team That is better than the NBA all-star, right?

520
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,094
Speaker 0: I mean dreams.

521
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:39,904
Speaker 0: I think a long long time ago on gig nights I talked about the the Global Football League.

522
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:46,159
Speaker 0: that was American football played by literally everyone but the United States and how utterly amazing that league was.

523
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:49,280
Speaker 0: Yes, Japan was apparently the champion for multiple years in a row.

524
00:34:49,561 --> 00:35:00,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, the point is I think that where possible right where there is some leverage like say NBA Right, the NBA has way more leverage than Activision Blizzard does.

525
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,240
Speaker 1: well, yes and no, right?

526
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:11,040
Speaker 1: So well if the NBA was to say fine China free stop Massacring those who eager people or otherwise no basketball for you, right?

527
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:14,020
Speaker 1: I feel like they have a moral imperative to do that.

528
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,467
Speaker 1: They aren't gonna but they should.

529
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,377
Speaker 1: I would if I was the Commission or whatever.

530
00:35:17,397 --> 00:35:20,400
Speaker 1: Yeah But think about Blizzard, right?

531
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:34,208
Speaker 1: There's probably actually more people in China playing and caring about Blizzard games playing Wow store craft overwatch Diablo true, however combined however are People who need NBA.

532
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:38,920
Speaker 1: imagine if we're just like alright everyone who's ever bought hearthstone cards in guess what?

533
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:47,080
Speaker 1: We're shutting down all Chinese servers and blocking Anyone in China from accessing any server in any other country and we're kicking you all out of our eSports.

534
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:47,904
Speaker 1: That's it.

535
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:53,889
Speaker 1: No, no, no what Chinese people can do any play any Blizzard game You just all cut off until your country is better, you know.

536
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,099
Speaker 1: exert that kind of force instead of just bowing.

537
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:09,220
Speaker 0: the Trouble is what those people in China get way mad and do something or with the state apparatus of propaganda basically minimize the existence of overwatch in Blizzard.

538
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:20,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean if you've been playing World of Warcraft in China for how fucking long and suddenly China is actually very different from World of Warcraft in the US I'm sure it is but it's still you if you're invested in a game.

539
00:36:20,673 --> 00:36:26,560
Speaker 1: You spent a lot of years on it and You're pro, you know, I get this guy's, you know, the guy who quit hearthstone, right?

540
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,724
Speaker 1: He's like, well, I lost four years of my life, but you know, he doesn't seem you know, obviously for him It's more important, right?

541
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:35,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, but imagine this is imagine if you were pro China, right?

542
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:42,160
Speaker 1: You're a Chinese person who's pro China But you also, you know play a Blizzard game and suddenly it's just like up.

543
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:45,169
Speaker 1: We deleted your account because your country sucks.

544
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:45,751
Speaker 1: fix your shit.

545
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:48,540
Speaker 1: You may be that person would get mad and do something.

546
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:48,822
Speaker 1: I don't know.

547
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:57,020
Speaker 0: if they'd get that message though the message from the state Propaganda apparatus would be this this evil capitalist company is denying you this because they hate you.

548
00:36:57,502 --> 00:37:05,560
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure also I would also both, you know before I got blocked in China I would disseminate messages to all the players and then go right.

549
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:11,280
Speaker 1: It's like they would try to open up, you know, their Starcraft and it would say exactly, you know, right?

550
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,365
Speaker 1: I'd sneak that patch in.

551
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:14,919
Speaker 1: it would be on their computer before it got blocked.

552
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,840
Speaker 0: Yep There's there's a complication here that I don't you know, it involves a lot of you know.

553
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,410
Speaker 1: There's a lot of details and how you exit.

554
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,920
Speaker 0: but I want to get to the main bit.

555
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,689
Speaker 0: But there's a complication here in that Activision Blizzard is a publicly traded company.

556
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:39,340
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Denies itself a whole bunch of profits in Situations that I'm not qualified legally to give you any advice.

557
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:45,912
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, but I. but the point is regardless of that duty I would just a ignore that duty right.

558
00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:47,940
Speaker 1: and then it's like I'm a big CEO, right?

559
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,052
Speaker 1: It's like okay the the board take and the shareholders take me to court.

560
00:37:52,393 --> 00:37:54,560
Speaker 1: I would first of all a have lawyers and an argument.

561
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:57,460
Speaker 1: I'd be like, well, you know, the American players are all leaving.

562
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,406
Speaker 1: I had to do something.

563
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:00,720
Speaker 0: this is to be richer than you and a better lawyers.

564
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean that's not the point.

565
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,660
Speaker 1: The point is I have an excuse.

566
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,088
Speaker 1: I would go and argue the excuse in court.

567
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:08,835
Speaker 1: Even if I lose right?

568
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:10,380
Speaker 0: It's like you did the right thing, right?

569
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,420
Speaker 1: I did the right thing, but here's the thing.

570
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:13,640
Speaker 1: I can sleep at night.

571
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:20,339
Speaker 1: And in fact, I would be happy because like well I fuck China good and I fuck these rich asshole bosses double good.

572
00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:22,785
Speaker 1: most American made their shares worth nothing.

573
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:23,146
Speaker 1: Fuck them.

574
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:28,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, most American success gamer bros who just want to play their triple-a games.

575
00:38:29,502 --> 00:38:38,580
Speaker 0: The trouble for them, I'm not saying we should give a shit about them, but without the Chinese market I think a good chunk of the American video game industry disappears.

576
00:38:38,601 --> 00:38:43,052
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah probably because we're already in the middle of a huge bubble who played the triple-a games.

577
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:48,708
Speaker 1: don't realize how much you're being propped up and Subsidized by you know, the Chinese.

578
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:51,960
Speaker 0: we're thinking about doing a Tuesday show on the price of games.

579
00:38:52,861 --> 00:38:55,719
Speaker 0: That's a topic that we can't get into because it's time for.

580
00:39:01,324 --> 00:39:04,345
Speaker 0: but anyway things Of the day.

581
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:07,755
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid, I believed in UFOs hundred percent.

582
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,400
Speaker 0: I thought it was for real me.

583
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,123
Speaker 1: It was real.

584
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:13,320
Speaker 1: I would go to the library and check out UFO books.

585
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:24,160
Speaker 0: It was mostly because all these stupid shows on TV that I believed Yeah, stupidly and one of those shows the one that I think is primarily responsible for this for me was unsolved mysteries.

586
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:27,191
Speaker 1: I didn't I mean I only watched that one a little bit.

587
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:31,508
Speaker 1: It was more for me like these random Every episode of this.

588
00:39:31,528 --> 00:39:34,140
Speaker 1: I watched all these like weird Roswell's special things.

589
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:39,782
Speaker 1: I even when I learned about the FOA was AOL.

590
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:41,147
Speaker 1: it was actually a page.

591
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:44,660
Speaker 1: you could send an FOA request and I sent an FOA request.

592
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:52,038
Speaker 1: I did something similar on prodigy for Roswell shit, and then they the government sent me this big envelope full of papers I didn't read.

593
00:39:53,182 --> 00:40:02,479
Speaker 1: It was like a huge ass envelope full of a ton of documents and I found that Documents when I cleaned out my mom's house recently and then I recycled it but only like a third of the mysteries.

594
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:04,465
Speaker 0: that unsolved mysteries were ghosts or aliens.

595
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:08,699
Speaker 0: the rest were just like murders and financial crimes like real crimes with real people.

596
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:20,706
Speaker 1: and Yeah, the one I remember though The only unsolved mysteries episode I actually have a clear memory of was like ghost in a hotel that George Washington stated Okay, so I wasn't mr.

597
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:21,970
Speaker 1: Remember I wasn't making up a memory.

598
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,753
Speaker 0: That's a real episode.

599
00:40:22,813 --> 00:40:23,837
Speaker 0: Okay, good.

600
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:31,675

601
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:37,892
Speaker 0: nice and even better They did the syndication Episodes meaning they have the full commercial breaks.

602
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:39,719

603
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,405

Speaker 1: Okay, but not the commercial not the commercial I was gonna say.

606
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:47,412
Speaker 1: how are they get the rice of the commercial?

607
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:48,680
Speaker 0: because it's in syndication.

608
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:49,886
Speaker 0: It's those episodes.

609
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:54,940
Speaker 0: if they solved it while the show was still going They actually show you the solution.

610
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,277
Speaker 0: So I was watching one last night and it was or watching it and I'm watching this piece of shit.

611
00:40:59,297 --> 00:40:59,980
Speaker 0: husband who?

612
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,665
Speaker 0: 100% murdered his wife.

613
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:03,452
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, and it's him.

614
00:41:03,492 --> 00:41:05,660
Speaker 0: It's actually him and like it's real people in this show.

615
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,926
Speaker 1: It's not it's not actors.

616
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:08,895
Speaker 0: No, most of the people in the show reenactors.

617
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:10,642
Speaker 0: They were not actors They were the actual people.

618
00:41:10,723 --> 00:41:15,236
Speaker 0: Okay, so which actually is weird watching this like 20 30 years later.

619
00:41:15,317 --> 00:41:21,015
Speaker 1: Those people are older dead Yeah, but uh, we're way older than they were and they're like, we'll never know.

620
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:31,674
Speaker 0: and I was like that guy did it 100% holy shit, that husband did it like holy shit, and then it cut to the update and it was like Yeah, the husband fucking did it and we sent him to jail.

621
00:41:31,715 --> 00:41:35,988
Speaker 0: and I was like, yes Yeah, the show crazily enough.

622
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:39,820
Speaker 1: if you killed your wife, why the fuck would you go on TV to prove his innocence?

623
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,393
Speaker 0: I get the impression they work.

624
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:51,780
Speaker 0: they tricked a lot of murderers into literally being on this show and then they got caught because of the show because the crazy thing is Your case that otherwise could have been a cold.

625
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:53,910
Speaker 1: This show you don't want attention.

626
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,980
Speaker 1: if you committed a crime you want to be quiet.

627
00:41:56,201 --> 00:42:02,220
Speaker 0: This show was before the internet and they legit solved a lot of crimes because people called these tip lines.

628
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:22,059
Speaker 1: so a lot of crimes only get solved or investigated or prosecuted by even like even like the DA like the public prosecutors will find out about cases to go and investigate from basically Journalists investigative journalists some journalists and this is basically is investigator journalism, right?

629
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:30,500
Speaker 1: So I'm independent journalists working for a TV station trying to make a TV show is looking through some records Trying to find cases that weren't solved, right?

630
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,620
Speaker 1: Oh, here was a person who was as a death certificate of murder and no one went to jail for it.

631
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:46,200
Speaker 1: Let's go get all the info we can and then suddenly it's on TV and then the prosecutor is it brought to their attention And then oh look we solved it because they actually put effort into it because we brought attention to it.

632
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,973
Speaker 0: the funniest thing though, is that Emily never really seen this show.

633
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:50,760
Speaker 0: So never.

634
00:42:52,662 --> 00:42:54,187
Speaker 0: But the way I described it was like.

635
00:42:54,428 --> 00:43:00,752
Speaker 0: so every episode will have like a UFO a Murdered wife of some kind of some sort of embezzled like.

636
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,779
Speaker 0: I listed like that the cliches of the show.

637
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:07,560
Speaker 0: Let me turn on the episode and it was literally the cliches someone embezzling a UFO from there.

638
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,992
Speaker 0: So What do you got?

639
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:13,330

Speaker 0: All right Oh, this is so good.

644
00:43:23,002 --> 00:43:27,780
Speaker 1: And if you know a lot of games these days, especially Nintendo games like Breath of the Wild has a little camera.

645
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:33,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, Jimmy selfies I've taken in front of ridiculous shit in that game and you often forget to use it like cuz when you get it.

646
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:40,220
Speaker 1: they like Teach you to use it and make you do one quest involving it And then you pretty much hardly have to use it really anymore in the game.

647
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,939
Speaker 1: You can you get benefits from using it, but you don't have to write.

648
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:49,887
Speaker 1: I barely used the camera at all in Breath of the Wild and then I only used it a couple times like alright I can use it to find items.

649
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:52,480
Speaker 1: And yeah, I was like I used it for a couple things and that was it.

650
00:43:54,629 --> 00:43:57,507
Speaker 1: But yeah Mario Odyssey also has a camera.

651
00:43:57,607 --> 00:44:01,240
Speaker 1: I think a lot of Nintendo games just look for the camera cuz it's gonna be there, right?

652
00:44:02,082 --> 00:44:13,659
Speaker 1: And he went and says a photographer played Mario Odyssey and also used the fuck out of the camera with their professional photography skills and took all these photos of Mario's Odyssey.

653
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:20,803
Speaker 1: and It's some really great fucking photography and composition Going on here.

Speaker 1: It's really great.

656
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,135
Speaker 1: I don't know how much Photoshop was involved.

657
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,920
Speaker 1: I think he's at least removing.

658
00:44:28,562 --> 00:44:40,333
Speaker 1: You know some various things possibly from scenes or cropping definitely in certain scenes and things like that but in general Still fucking great job Using the camera in Mario Odyssey.

659
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:52,675
Speaker 1: I Caught you know, I did actually Think about doing this in some way because I know that like Just like general FPS games any game with a camera on Steam.

660
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:54,080
Speaker 1: You can just use the screenshot button.

661
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:57,776
Speaker 1: Yep, so there were times I think I took like a photo in Skyrim once.

662
00:44:57,816 --> 00:44:58,519
Speaker 1: that was way good.

663
00:44:59,801 --> 00:45:00,483
Speaker 1: It's a stuff like this.

664
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:08,168
Speaker 1: I've thought about this in the past, but this person has taken it to the extreme Conclusive level that it deserves.

665
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:10,396
Speaker 0: These are great and some of it like they're subtle.

666
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,540
Speaker 0: They're just well composed.

667
00:45:11,784 --> 00:45:12,639

Speaker 1: You got like operating around right stock the basic core idea of all these 18xx games, right?

718
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,080
Speaker 1: I think we reviewed 1846, which if you are gonna play get into these games, that is the first one to play.

719
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, do not start with this one.

720
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:33,172
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

721
00:47:33,192 --> 00:47:34,540
Speaker 0: I want to recommend playing this one.

722
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,430
Speaker 1: We were interviewed we reviewed it in late 2017.

723
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:37,530
Speaker 1: Now.

724
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:49,866
Speaker 1: I've played a lot more of these games since 2017 And basically the core of these games is this really they seem complicated and they are complicated for the average person but that's because of reasons.

725
00:47:50,127 --> 00:48:18,240
Speaker 1: but the core thing of all these games is that you invest in companies in One round then you the companies actually do business for two rounds two identical rounds And then you invest or divest in companies again, and you repeat this cycle of invest come work work invest work work and whoever has the most shares in a company at During the work set turns is the person who actually controls that company during the work turn.

726
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:20,172
Speaker 1: It's like you know, the company isn't you.

727
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:21,420
Speaker 1: it's separate from you.

728
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:25,400
Speaker 0: You you have your money you and you run companies that you have a majority share, right?

729
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,560
Speaker 1: So to win you want your money to be the most at the end of the game when the bank runs out of money.

730
00:48:31,022 --> 00:48:33,633
Speaker 1: But you know, so you sometimes you control a company.

731
00:48:33,653 --> 00:48:35,220
Speaker 1: Sometimes you might not control any companies.

732
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,253
Speaker 1: You might buy a company that used to be someone else's.

733
00:48:37,273 --> 00:48:41,960
Speaker 0: you might sell a company now It might end up with three companies in front of you and now your turn takes for fucking ever, right?

734
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,560
Speaker 1: It's like, you know the companies go in order.

735
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,896
Speaker 1: So it's like one company might go then it's someone else's company and then it's your company.

736
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:47,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how it works.

737
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:56,760
Speaker 1: Yep investing and then The companies do business and then you investigate and you're controlling basically your investment decisions.

738
00:48:56,881 --> 00:48:58,458
Speaker 1: Which companies do I want to have shares in?

739
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:10,480
Speaker 1: Along with Trying to make certain companies do well and make some do worse the ones that you have more shares in you want to do better So they spit out more money and the ones you don't have shares in you want them to do worse.

740
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:12,809
Speaker 1: So that's other people will not make as much money.

741
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:13,953
Speaker 1: So when the game ends you win.

742
00:49:14,254 --> 00:49:15,640
Speaker 1: That's that's all there really is to it.

743
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:15,925
Speaker 1: Yes,

744
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:27,536
Speaker 0: and if you want About like these details like what these games are like on like this higher level I will link to go listen to our old review of 1846 because that's where we talk about a lot of this in detail

745
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:28,038
Speaker 1: right and that we're

746
00:49:28,058 --> 00:49:37,349
Speaker 0: gonna review This train game in comparison to other train games and in the context of I was about to say normal No, it's just a regular board game.

747
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:41,520
Speaker 1: If you don't understand the other train games You're not gonna understand this review really?

748
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:48,580
Speaker 1: Well, cuz I mean I was hard to talk about it and except using words that only people who understand these games will understand.

749
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:48,782
Speaker 1: and

750
00:49:48,802 --> 00:50:03,928
Speaker 0: the other thing I would say is that This game 2038 tycoons of the asteroid belt If you have never played one of these friend games before and you like the kinds of board games you see the game like packs I Doubt you will enjoy playing this game

751
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:04,370
Speaker 1: right?

752
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,120
Speaker 0: This game is not easy to play, right?

753
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:15,756
Speaker 1: There is no reason for me to try to explain this game and simpler You know in terms to someone who doesn't know anything about these games because this shouldn't be your first one.

754
00:50:15,837 --> 00:50:16,900
Speaker 1: and if it you right.

755
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:30,552
Speaker 1: Only reason to listen to this review is if you already know about train games 18xx games and you want to know about this one, but the reason of that because I like what 1899 1889 89 is the Japanese my favorite one so far.

756
00:50:30,552 --> 00:50:41,691
Speaker 0: 1846 is by like second or third I like in 46. but but the thing the thing I'll say about these games that's relevant here Is that they all have this fundamental problem of I don't want to say naive game design.

757
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:50,800
Speaker 0: It's not that problem, but they are designed For goals other than elegance and consistency of their mechanic.

758
00:50:50,902 --> 00:50:51,414
Speaker 0: They're eggs.

759
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,611
Speaker 0: They're designed for the historical experience.

760
00:50:55,033 --> 00:50:59,709
Speaker 0: people that people play them tend to like Very fiddly rules that have like.

761
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,779
Speaker 0: there will be more exceptions to a rule than the rule.

762
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:12,070
Speaker 0: like you really you cannot internalize all the rules to one of these games unless you play them a Lot and you play them a lot.

763
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:15,114
Speaker 0: They actually break down Pretty poorly.

764
00:51:15,317 --> 00:51:15,479
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

765
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:24,040
Speaker 0: So the problem with these games for someone who likes to play normal board games Is that you can't just learn the mechanics and then start to play?

766
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:34,294
Speaker 0: You need to be constantly figuring out all the exceptions and fucking with the rules and unless you have a facilitator Basically, these games only need a game master or an expert to help you play them or a computer.

767
00:51:34,315 --> 00:51:35,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll get to that.

768
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:38,187
Speaker 0: Then they're very difficult to play.

769
00:51:38,227 --> 00:51:41,196
Speaker 0: but that said I love the shit out of 1846, right?

770
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:53,320
Speaker 1: Like I said that core concept of investing in companies Controlling some of them right and trying to make the most money is a great game and I still think you could even replace.

771
00:51:53,682 --> 00:52:00,660
Speaker 1: You can and the best part is that simple framework can be expanded contracted and rearranged to make lots and lots of different games.

772
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,920
Speaker 1: You could make the investment part simpler or more complex or even crazy complex.

773
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:07,993
Speaker 1: You can make the operating part a completely different game.

774
00:52:08,013 --> 00:52:12,353
Speaker 1: There's a game called a Should big city shoulders or something like that.

775
00:52:12,373 --> 00:52:13,920
Speaker 1: I forget the exact name of the game.

776
00:52:13,981 --> 00:52:19,355
Speaker 1: If you go to board game geek and type in shoulders There aren't that many fucking games with the name word shoulders in the title.

777
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:20,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna find it.

778
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,439
Speaker 1: I think it might be city of the big shoulders.

779
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,898
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's an 18xx game with an investment round and operating rounds the big shoulders.

780
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:31,535
Speaker 1: I got it, right But basically instead of trains it's like a euro game.

781
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:36,157
Speaker 1: in the operating part It's like you invest and then you play a euro game and then you invest.

782
00:52:36,217 --> 00:52:39,948
Speaker 1: it's the same Right, well then there's games like Chicago Express.

783
00:52:40,229 --> 00:52:48,120
Speaker 0: take the core concepts of a train game and just like Distill distill distill right anyway, our Paris connection.

784
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:55,680
Speaker 1: So 2038. what it does is it gets rid of the historical part by putting you way into a theoretical space future.

785
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,400
Speaker 1: We know we're probably not gonna have space trains in 2038 at the rate things are going.

786
00:53:00,062 --> 00:53:13,698
Speaker 0: but if we did which already presents a problem from a game design perspective because the fiddly like fucky mechanics of the other historical train games at least are trying to model very real-world history.

787
00:53:13,999 --> 00:53:23,840
Speaker 0: meaning if you want if you know something about the 1840s in the Midwest that historical knowledge will actually help you a little bit better.

788
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:34,022
Speaker 0: I'm not a lot but like a little bit like you can intuitively play the game By doing the things that make sense as an intelligent human being looking at a complex situation Mm-hmm,

789
00:53:34,766 --> 00:53:38,425
Speaker 1: and in fact if you do things that happened in history Right or you

790
00:53:38,445 --> 00:53:40,374
Speaker 0: tend to play out the way they played out in history,

791
00:53:40,534 --> 00:53:40,775
Speaker 1: right?

792
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:41,680
Speaker 1: They tend to play out.

793
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:48,686
Speaker 1: So it's like oh, yeah that that rail line was built there from the Civil War Caused it to be irrelevant right?

794
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,191
Speaker 1: and then they had to dynamite it.

795
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:56,740
Speaker 1: and that happened around this year and the game starts in this Year, so if I do that at this timing it'll print it kind of work.

796
00:53:57,001 --> 00:54:03,220
Speaker 0: So the games are almost more experiences like if I play an 18xx game and I lose terribly like go bankrupt or something.

797
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:09,916
Speaker 0: It's still really fun because it's almost like I'm playing this weird Simulations like playing a Civ game just to see how the world ends up.

798
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:13,109
Speaker 1: I've never won And I've never been upset playing an 18xx game.

799
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:22,000
Speaker 0: Yep, but with 2038 It has that same level of fiddly shit from a fictional inconsistent world, right?

800
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:34,180
Speaker 0: And the thing is the fiddly shit is So fiddly that it becomes Onerous the operating round of this game where you run the trains like my train goes here here and here to make this much money.

801
00:54:34,742 --> 00:54:38,359
Speaker 0: It's really fun and makes sense and I liked it.

802
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:41,933
Speaker 0: But as soon as it scales up even a little bit it is.

803
00:54:42,434 --> 00:54:43,920
Speaker 0: it is a disastrous mechanic.

804
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:46,140
Speaker 0: Like it is it is own playable.

805
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:51,980
Speaker 1: So normally the way it works in most most of the 18xx games is when you actually run.

806
00:54:52,302 --> 00:54:58,635
Speaker 1: There's a point at which after everyone's done building tracks and shit We figure out how much each money each train spits out.

807
00:54:58,655 --> 00:55:00,380
Speaker 1: and what you do is you look at the board He's alright.

808
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:09,580
Speaker 1: my train has to start at one of my spots right and it gets blocked by other people's spots and It can go in pretty much any track right?

809
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,265
Speaker 1: My trains just can't.

810
00:55:11,386 --> 00:55:14,740
Speaker 1: my trains can't overlap each other, but I have to care about what anyone else's trains do.

811
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,088
Speaker 1: I just can't go through any spots.

812
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:17,255
Speaker 1: They're blocking with their station.

813
00:55:17,295 --> 00:55:20,318
Speaker 1: Yep, right So it's pretty easy to look at a board.

814
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:26,660
Speaker 1: It might not be easy to a hundred percent perfectly get the best pot most money out of the trains.

815
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,264
Speaker 1: Well, you're close enough, but you can get very close and once you get very close, it's like well What changed since last turn?

816
00:55:32,284 --> 00:55:34,069
Speaker 1: Well, one piece of track was upgraded.

817
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:35,815
Speaker 1: Well, I guess my route is upgraded by $10.

818
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:36,276
Speaker 1: then, right?

819
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:42,318
Speaker 1: I'll just run the same route again with that one upgrade and you don't have tends to balance to where it takes.

820
00:55:42,379 --> 00:55:47,900
Speaker 0: it might take You a little while to figure out but that is downtime for the other players to figure out some shit that they're gonna be doing.

821
00:55:48,122 --> 00:55:50,041
Speaker 1: It's not too bad It's.

822
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:51,064
Speaker 1: it could be improved.

823
00:55:51,104 --> 00:55:56,440
Speaker 1: a computer should just tell you the optimal routes and spit out the money with no thunking whatsoever.

824
00:55:56,882 --> 00:56:01,380
Speaker 1: But it's not so bad that you're it's a problem that you're like frustrated with.

825
00:56:02,202 --> 00:56:20,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, 2038 the way it works is each train each company operates in order ain't no tracks in space Right going around with their spaceship mining asteroids and collecting or and but the problem Is right when it potentially refueling.

826
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:32,671
Speaker 1: right when a ship's picks up or Right, it picks up a little piece of cardboard off the board of flips it over and now no Spaceship for the rest of the turn can get that or it's that turn

827
00:56:32,691 --> 00:56:37,260
Speaker 0: might involve like five different companies each running Multiple spaceships, right?

828
00:56:37,380 --> 00:57:01,497
Speaker 1: So use the first person sends their spaceships out and now you see which oars have been flipped over And then the next person goes and sees which oars have been flipped over and basically each person has to Wait for each spaceship every turn Completely rethink and refigure out the exact optimal way to get the most best oars Right with each spaceship.

829
00:57:01,678 --> 00:57:09,222
Speaker 1: now And then you can't even begin to think about your spaceship until everyone before you has picked up resources with their Spaceships.

830
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:11,810
Speaker 0: this it made the game interminable.

831
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:18,196
Speaker 1: now in one hand and the early turns is not a big deal because it's like, okay Well, this one picks up the only two oars it can reach and no one else can reach them.

832
00:57:18,678 --> 00:57:24,467
Speaker 1: fine And there are also ways to stake claims on Certain resources and no one can take them.

833
00:57:24,527 --> 00:57:29,680
Speaker 1: and hopefully you would claim the best ones and that way you can quickly just be like Well, this ship takes all the claim spots.

834
00:57:29,941 --> 00:57:32,780
Speaker 1: You know thinking necessary because no one else can take those they're claimed.

835
00:57:33,202 --> 00:57:39,287
Speaker 1: but you still get when you get better ships and more of them and Unclaimed spots or you ran out of claims.

836
00:57:39,307 --> 00:57:40,251
Speaker 1: You don't have enough claims.

837
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:47,290
Speaker 1: those later turns in the game starting about halfway through Become a big mess plus it gets hard of that.

838
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:52,939
Speaker 0: might have been that the way we were playing it because we weren't Fully versed in like there's no history to look at.

839
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:57,174
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we ended up making companies in a way that was a little bit weird.

840
00:57:57,475 --> 00:58:00,615
Speaker 0: Yeah the way the board broke down Totally legal though Yeah but totally legal.

841
00:58:00,655 --> 00:58:06,881
Speaker 0: but It basically means that there is a trap where if the game evolves a certain way the game will take four times longer than it normally Would.

842
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:09,889
Speaker 0: but even if the game performed optimally optimally.

843
00:58:10,551 --> 00:58:14,925
Speaker 0: this operating around situation would still be a serious problem right and even worse.

844
00:58:15,427 --> 00:58:25,320
Speaker 0: unlike say eclipse which has a very Elegant physical mechanism for representing complex resources this game gives you fuck all for physical bits.

845
00:58:25,642 --> 00:58:36,479
Speaker 0: You could solve this problem not a computer But you can solve like a third of this problem just by having better physical Components and ways to track this stuff better.

846
00:58:36,882 --> 00:58:38,754
Speaker 0: It doesn't give you anything to do this.

847
00:58:38,855 --> 00:58:39,539
Speaker 1: another thing to have.

848
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,260
Speaker 1: Another thing that contributes is also the lack of stability in the game and a lot of other train games.

849
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,513
Speaker 1: There'll be a series of rounds where things pretty much stayed mostly the same.

850
00:58:48,553 --> 00:58:54,405
Speaker 1: like the turn order of the company stays the same mostly, you know the Ownership of the company stays the same.

851
00:58:54,446 --> 00:58:54,767
Speaker 1: mostly.

852
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:58,638
Speaker 1: everyone just sort of operates and upgrades for a few turns just moving things along.

853
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:00,022
Speaker 1: here It's like all right.

854
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:05,240
Speaker 1: well this turn suddenly this company's value went way up, and it's going earlier, so that changes everything.

855
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:05,942
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

856
00:59:06,223 --> 00:59:09,355
Speaker 1: Oh and now these all these companies merge into the asteroid league.

857
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:10,860
Speaker 1: well that fucking changes everything.

858
00:59:11,463 --> 00:59:12,228
Speaker 0: Right we'll get to that.

859
00:59:12,268 --> 00:59:12,771
Speaker 0: We'll get to that.

860
00:59:12,831 --> 00:59:14,440
Speaker 0: I want to talk about that cuz that part's really cool.

861
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,505
Speaker 1: I really like that part.

862
00:59:15,545 --> 00:59:16,851
Speaker 1: That part is really cool.

863
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:18,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's basically you know in these train games.

864
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:26,907
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just saying it contributes to the instability and that you have to rethink the Gathering a resource part.

865
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:36,034
Speaker 1: every single time you're starting from scratch again Optimizing which or for each spaceship, and it's just this busy work.

866
00:59:36,075 --> 00:59:37,620
Speaker 1: It's not even like decision-making.

867
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,024
Speaker 1: I guess there's a little bit.

868
00:59:39,064 --> 00:59:51,197
Speaker 1: you could theoretically take a suboptimal route with a ship to pick up resources to deny another ship Resources, but not in a super significant way once the board is full of asteroids everywhere.

869
00:59:51,217 --> 01:00:01,471
Speaker 0: to complicate this There are ways to refuel ships so then that they can move even further if they move a certain way Making it actually a pretty difficult problem to solve and optimize.

870
01:00:01,511 --> 01:00:08,510
Speaker 0: for like I even to give an unlimited time on a complex board It would take me a while to fully optimize.

871
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:11,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it would actually be hard to write a computer program.

872
01:00:11,661 --> 01:00:17,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, we optimize The search graph would be enormous, and you'll have multiple kinds of ships.

873
01:00:17,617 --> 01:00:29,140
Speaker 0: so when you're buying ships So I want the one that moves further and picks up less or the ones that are like there's way too many Variables for the operating round which should be the least interesting part of a train.

874
01:00:29,381 --> 01:00:34,116
Speaker 1: It's not the part where you're making decisions, and I think that's a fundamental problem with all the train games.

875
01:00:34,577 --> 01:00:38,269
Speaker 1: Is that the Part of the investing part of the game?

876
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:45,858
Speaker 1: the stock round is what actually most Determines the victory condition which player wins which player loses which shares?

877
01:00:45,878 --> 01:00:47,002
Speaker 1: you have Right.

878
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:55,607
Speaker 1: the second part of the game the operating rounds are our only sort of Secondary to who wins and loses.

879
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:00,380
Speaker 1: right they're important because they control how much money each company is spitting out.

880
01:01:00,743 --> 01:01:25,469
Speaker 1: But if everyone's good Anyway, any good gamer can operate a company not optimally, but optimally enough that it's you know right and The actual decisions made during the operating round aren't as crucial to the actual victory condition of the game But they take a disproportionate amount of the time and effort and the stock rounds are usually Oversimplified and don't take long at all.

881
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:27,960
Speaker 1: so you're just buying and selling shares going in a circle.

882
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,645
Speaker 1: It's real simple

883
01:01:28,947 --> 01:01:39,982
Speaker 0: the really cool part about this game Which is why I really wanted to like it and this is why I want I want to make a computer version of this game and then fix a bunch of stuff, but 2048 2058

884
01:01:39,982 --> 01:01:40,604
Speaker 1: and some

885
01:01:40,685 --> 01:01:42,573
Speaker 0: of the other train games the

886
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,724
Speaker 1: 2057 or 58 different time.

887
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,735
Speaker 1: you understand different different spaceships.

888
01:01:48,258 --> 01:01:53,055
Speaker 0: the Independent companies tend to be pretty simple and disappear pretty quick in this game.

889
01:01:53,477 --> 01:02:03,999
Speaker 0: They're all way different Yeah, and you're running like real companies of privates, and there's this whole complicated mechanic where based on things I don't want to explain in too much depth because you can learn this game if you want to play it.

890
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:09,959
Speaker 0: They can either join the asteroid league or not join the asteroid league at some point in the future.

891
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:24,191
Speaker 0: yep And the asteroid league then becomes this company, and there's a whole like system around this that is Really cool, and I really wanted to interact with that by playing the game more times Until I ran into the operating round deadlock.

892
01:02:24,231 --> 01:02:25,758
Speaker 0: that made me never want to play this game again.

893
01:02:25,778 --> 01:02:27,891
Speaker 1: Yeah I actually had the asteroid league.

894
01:02:27,932 --> 01:02:36,170
Speaker 1: I was the asteroid league guy I know which made it pretty cool because like I started the game with one space company Understood that I could withhold or pay out.

895
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:37,776
Speaker 0: We're like I had the option.

896
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:39,100
Speaker 0: with these into these privates.

897
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:44,399
Speaker 0: I would have done something way different right and you can also take a private and like turn it into a company early.

898
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:44,560
Speaker 0: like.

899
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:44,701
Speaker 0: There's.

900
01:02:45,022 --> 01:02:48,339
Speaker 0: there's way more ways to form companies and do company stuff in the.

901
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:49,046
Speaker 1: yeah You could start.

902
01:02:49,066 --> 01:03:02,066
Speaker 1: you can make a growth company which is a company that's worth like nothing at the start of the game and Basically instead of joining asteroid league you'd start this little like I little startup who like ships like one good Basically and sucks ass.

903
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:05,460
Speaker 0: it starts with no share value, but I bought those shares for nothing right?

904
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,913
Speaker 1: But those shares were worth nothing because the company was like a guy with a like.

905
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:10,860
Speaker 1: a true space truck is a galaxy trucker.

906
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:11,528
Speaker 0: But I didn't.

907
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:21,160
Speaker 1: and then it Theoretically if you start one early enough and work on it and work on it That can work out to end up being like a big-ass awesome company, and that's what I didn't understand.

908
01:03:21,643 --> 01:03:23,555
Speaker 0: I kept paying out because I had our.

909
01:03:23,635 --> 01:03:25,465
Speaker 0: I had ice finder Which was a really like.

910
01:03:25,525 --> 01:03:28,879
Speaker 0: it was making a shit ton of money for a private because the way I'd set it up.

911
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,780
Speaker 0: So I was making all this money, and I was paying out dividends to myself, and it was awesome.

912
01:03:33,263 --> 01:03:34,472
Speaker 0: I didn't realize I could withhold.

913
01:03:34,613 --> 01:03:36,261
Speaker 0: even in these privates I Will.

914
01:03:36,281 --> 01:03:40,480
Speaker 0: if I'd known that I would have withheld and I would have gotten a couple of fewer shares of like the other company.

915
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,122
Speaker 1: We're just having a discussion about how it should be illegal to withhold and companies should have to pay out dividends and the profits You do.

916
01:03:46,404 --> 01:03:51,624
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, but train games are about your evil capitalist Corrupt system.

917
01:03:51,644 --> 01:03:52,186
Speaker 1: understand?

918
01:03:52,407 --> 01:03:55,078
Speaker 0: yeah, no I would do the completely unethical thing.

919
01:03:55,098 --> 01:04:00,680
Speaker 0: yeah I would have withheld I would have turned ice finder into an indoor growth company, and I would have made Bank.

920
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:02,580
Speaker 0: I played this game way different.

921
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:04,870
Speaker 1: I had the asteroid league and it was way fun.

922
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,000
Speaker 1: when the asteroid League formed that was way fun.

923
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:11,560
Speaker 1: But the problem was is now I had to control this giant ass asteroid League and that kind of sucked.

924
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:17,496
Speaker 0: So Chris in the chat says the asteroid League miners thing comes from a different 18xx game.

925
01:04:17,516 --> 01:04:18,740
Speaker 0: That's more normal, okay?

926
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,263
Speaker 0: Okay, we're gonna.

927
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:20,411
Speaker 0: I want to play that one whichever one.

928
01:04:20,431 --> 01:04:21,579
Speaker 0: that is our friend Chris.

929
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:27,463
Speaker 0: You'll see him in the forum, and he if you see a guy hanging out with us like playing train games at Pax's It's that guy.

930
01:04:27,584 --> 01:04:29,352
Speaker 0: alright Chris brings us the train game.

931
01:04:29,372 --> 01:04:29,673
Speaker 0: That's right.

932
01:04:29,714 --> 01:04:30,980
Speaker 1: I don't own any of these fucking things.

933
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:35,344
Speaker 0: I I would well I would consider owning 1846.

934
01:04:35,344 --> 01:04:37,013
Speaker 1: I wouldn't make one before I bought one.

935
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:42,433
Speaker 0: I would own it to Start ideating on how I would make one because this game taught me something.

936
01:04:42,493 --> 01:04:44,139
Speaker 1: just reader rolls PDF if I need to.

937
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:47,651
Speaker 0: yeah I would play 1846 1889 a lot of the other train games again.

938
01:04:47,672 --> 01:04:51,403
Speaker 0: I would never play 2038 again.

939
01:04:51,423 --> 01:05:01,640
Speaker 0: no not not in its default tabletop form but a video game That was designed to feel a lot like this tabletop game.

940
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:14,427
Speaker 0: But take advantage of the fact that it's a computer and have a little more complexity like these games would be more fun If you could have a little bit more complex stock market like if I could sell Options from a train company to other players.

941
01:05:14,628 --> 01:05:16,312
Speaker 0: or if a player sell futures.

942
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:23,053
Speaker 0: that would be fucking impossible to do elegantly out in the tabletop And if you made it too complicated it would just turn into sieve.

943
01:05:23,234 --> 01:05:30,960
Speaker 1: or I mean there is a New York one I think that has a Selling short and stock market is a little bit more complicated.

944
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:36,491
Speaker 1: But yeah like I said before The victory condition of all these games is mostly in the stock round.

945
01:05:36,531 --> 01:05:39,720
Speaker 1: the operating round is like this separate minigame of optimization.

946
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:45,120
Speaker 1: I would really like to play one where the stock round was more advanced and had more decisions.

947
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:50,940
Speaker 1: It was more complex and the operating round was simplified and made more elegant and streamlined and abstract.

948
01:05:51,924 --> 01:05:59,229
Speaker 1: And this while the theme and some of the detailed rules and cool Thematic things like the asteroid league and the mining.

949
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:03,000
Speaker 1: at least the the the theme of the mining make it awesome.

950
01:06:03,563 --> 01:06:06,760
Speaker 1: The reality is this the exact opposite of what I want in a train game.

951
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:18,054
Speaker 1: it is the a much simpler stock market released a normal level of complexity stock market for these games and a Ridiculously tedious operating rounds.

952
01:06:18,376 --> 01:06:23,533
Speaker 1: that are Have fun aspects, but just too many busy work aspects.

953
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,740
Speaker 1: They take too goddamn long.

954
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,908
Speaker 1: Here's the line to make it worth my while.

955
01:06:27,928 --> 01:06:31,180
Speaker 1: and so it's like 46 in 1889.

956
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,852
Speaker 0: It's like I'll still play those games cuz it's worth my while enough.

957
01:06:34,972 --> 01:06:35,173
Speaker 0: Yes.

958
01:06:35,233 --> 01:06:36,337
Speaker 1: The TDM is not in.

959
01:06:36,337 --> 01:06:40,315
Speaker 0: 2038 is Impossibly tedious in the operating round.

960
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:44,730
Speaker 1: Yep Alright, so if you want to play it get into these games.

961
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:53,380
Speaker 1: you can go listen to our old episode of 1846 or go play 1846 or Yeah, you can play that one too sure but do not play this one.

962
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,370
Speaker 0: Do you think that is actually better in a lot of ways?

963
01:06:55,491 --> 01:06:57,140
Speaker 1: some ways do not play this one?

964
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:58,825
Speaker 1: 2038 as your first one.

965
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:05,749
Speaker 1: if you're super experienced with these games and you don't mind some tedium and you just want to see what The deal is there's a lot to.

966
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:08,019
Speaker 1: there's some good stuff to see here in this one.

967
01:07:08,543 --> 01:07:17,731
Speaker 1: So I'd recommend like you play it learn it Maybe not play a whole game of it because it would take too long or maybe you just have a ton of time and think is Even though like our game went on so long.

968
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:19,460
Speaker 0: We got kicked out of packs and couldn't finish it, right?

969
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:24,440
Speaker 1: I would not recommend this one though for serious buying playing and replaying.

970
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:42,458
Speaker 0: Yep, but I realized something fundamental the primary problem with these games Is that because they are tabletop and because they have very fiddly rules everywhere else They end up needing to rely heavily on Start player order and the mechanics to determine that are just terrible.

971
01:07:42,478 --> 01:07:46,374
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And it matters too much to be a terrible mechanic.

972
01:07:46,575 --> 01:07:46,756
Speaker 1: Yep.

973
01:07:46,957 --> 01:07:51,440
Speaker 0: That is the thing I think you could solve with all of these tabletop games.

974
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,837
Speaker 0: You can make them more elegant without without ruining what makes them unique and different from the euros.

975
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:56,660
Speaker 0: We tend to like more.

976
01:07:56,761 --> 01:08:02,652
Speaker 1: Yes I'm in favor of a Simultaneous market and not an ordered market because I learned after plant.

977
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:05,822
Speaker 1: it took me like a year to Scott mule mule mule Right.

978
01:08:06,023 --> 01:08:09,520
Speaker 1: It took me a year or two to learn how important the priority deal is.

979
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,327
Speaker 1: That means you go first in the stock round.

980
01:08:11,608 --> 01:08:21,229
Speaker 1: how that gives you the can basically had you know You're having it at the right time is how you win the game and I've played several games of this and I basically got burned By it over and over that.

981
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:25,613
Speaker 1: I learned it but got burned by it Even though I saw it and was trying to grab this one.

982
01:08:25,755 --> 01:08:26,540
Speaker 0: I was the start play.

983
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:33,747
Speaker 0: I basically had the start for the most of the game because it was a three-player game and neither you were willing to like Rust stuff and I did.

984
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:34,531
Speaker 0: I just like I.

985
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:36,560
Speaker 1: well now there was a game of 1889.

986
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:42,319
Speaker 1: I played I think a magfest where I finally understood it and was trying to grab a hold of it.

987
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:43,247
Speaker 1: And right it's like.

988
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:46,703
Speaker 1: I understand it now, but I can't Can't get it.

989
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:47,466
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what that's like.

990
01:08:47,486 --> 01:08:49,814
Speaker 0: It's like ooh, I understand this raging bull now.

991
01:08:49,895 --> 01:08:51,241
Speaker 0: I will attempt to ride it Right.

992
01:08:51,322 --> 01:08:59,100
Speaker 1: It's like I understand what I have to do in a video game Even though I know when to I have to push the button at that time But I keep pushing it and it's not the right time and I keep dying.

993
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:12,560
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah when we played this it was the first time where I finally managed to grab a hold of that priority deal mechanic At the right time move my trains and one company to the other force the shitty company on to rim.

994
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:14,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, right get everything in order.

995
01:09:14,754 --> 01:09:15,720
Speaker 1: I didn't do it perfectly.

996
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:21,017
Speaker 1: I could have done it even better, but that's just because I didn't understand exactly when the trains would rust.

997
01:09:21,096 --> 01:09:21,880
Speaker 1: spaceships would rust.

998
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:27,500
Speaker 0: But the problem is like Is also so important and also relies on the turn order, right?

999
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,149
Speaker 1: But I could have screwed rim more.

1000
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:30,496
Speaker 1: but the point is that was the first.

1001
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:33,129
Speaker 1: it, you know It would regardless of which one he played.

1002
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:38,640
Speaker 1: this still would have been the one where I figured it out Finally, because it's the same mechanic and all of them basically.

1003
01:09:39,701 --> 01:09:40,764
Speaker 1: So coincidence there.

1004
01:09:41,225 --> 01:09:51,767
Speaker 0: So yeah space trains is the only one I've played so far that I would never play again Which is a shame because stylistically a Stylistically a plus it feels very do.

1005
01:09:51,807 --> 01:09:56,959
Speaker 1: all the characters and are and you know, everything about space wise is really great.
