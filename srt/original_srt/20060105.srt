1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,834
Speaker 1: It's Thursday January 5th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:16,140
Speaker 1: tonight we talk about TV from our childhood.

3
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:22,329
Speaker 1: Let's do this alright, so My company owns this other office.

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:42,459
Speaker 1: Well, they own a lot of offices all over the country, but they own this one office that's like on the border of Connecticut in New York in a weird place and they've been trying to make me go there or like asking me to go there recently and the other day I accidentally slept too much and my alarm didn't go off or I fucked up or who knows.

5
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:50,930
Speaker 1: and They you know sent me an email after I told them I wasn't gonna show up because it's not worth it to go with the Train and such to the city at such a late hour.

6
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:53,319
Speaker 1: and they're like, why don't you go to Vista?

7
00:00:53,339 --> 00:01:01,159
Speaker 1: and I'm like Because I have a crap car and I'm not gonna drive like an hour and a crap car, you know, it's not worth it.

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:13,804
Speaker 1: So today the boss's boss calls me to his office and I'm like, oh, maybe I'll get fired because my job is pretty boring right right now because I don't have a project to do and I haven't been doing much there.

9
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:17,919
Speaker 1: some kind, you know, I'm kind of ambivalent to whether I keep the job or not?

10
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:26,976
Speaker 1: so They he tells me to my surprise They want me to work in the Vista office because they need someone there.

11
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:27,599
Speaker 1: There's no one there.

12
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:29,727
Speaker 0: So why do they need someone there?

13
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:30,830
Speaker 1: I don't know they don't.

14
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:35,419
Speaker 1: I gonna ask I'm gonna I'm gonna go in and be all-in Next time because that's kind of weird.

15
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:38,910
Speaker 1: But to get me to work there, they're good.

16
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,834
Speaker 1: Just gonna give me a car.

17
00:01:39,854 --> 00:01:41,140
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,959
Speaker 1: He was like, yeah, we'll just lease you a car or give you a raise so you can buy one.

19
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:47,646
Speaker 0: That's not a bad deal.

20
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:50,060
Speaker 0: Then maybe you have to see how far a drive this actually is.

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,020
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go there tomorrow and then on Monday I'm gonna sort it all out at work after thinking about it over the weekend.

22
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:59,357
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, but if it really is like an hour drive, it might just be too painful.

23
00:01:59,417 --> 00:01:59,999
Speaker 1: It's not worth it.

24
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:06,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I had a 45-minute drive down the mountain when I used to live up there to work and it really wasn't that bad.

25
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:11,180
Speaker 0: But I don't know if that extra 15 minutes each way would have added up.

26
00:02:12,222 --> 00:02:12,785
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

27
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,860
Speaker 0: Plus I had a nice happy drive through the mountains.

28
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:20,002
Speaker 0: You're gonna have a crappy drive through non-throughway parts of New York State Mm-hmm.

29
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:27,819
Speaker 1: The real question is whether maybe if I get like an iPod in car type of thing I could be maybe okay You know, did you have an I trip that you lost?

30
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,911
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was only an I trip mini now so that I got a nano.

31
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,177
Speaker 1: it doesn't even matter if I lost it.

32
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:36,192
Speaker 1: nah I'm waiting for my trip nano that I pre-ordered to show up.

33
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:38,020
Speaker 0: Is it even shipping yet?

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,290
Speaker 1: No, I pre-ordered it and I'm still waiting and they said December.

35
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:41,711
Speaker 1: Guess what?

36
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:42,514
Speaker 1: It's January.

37
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:44,080
Speaker 0: Well raise a stink.

38
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:48,960
Speaker 1: I might raise a stink or I might just say fuck it and get one of those like car integration kits.

39
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:52,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not that expensive and they're actually a lot better than the I trip.

40
00:02:52,677 --> 00:03:05,480
Speaker 0: Yep It's great and all but it uses the FM mini broadcast type thing and that's real antenna weather Moon phases sunspot dependent in terms of quality.

41
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:12,836
Speaker 1: Well, if I accept this offer and get the car They'll probably look into the integration kit and not if not, I'll probably just wait for the trip to show up.

42
00:03:13,498 --> 00:03:15,443
Speaker 1: Yep All right.

43
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:19,640
Speaker 0: Yep, but in real news remember that horrible horrible windows exploit.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,432
Speaker 0: We've been talking about the WMF thing.

45
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:22,499
Speaker 1: We had to talk about it again.

46
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:31,664
Speaker 0: Well windows released an emergency patch today And I just want to kind of warn all of you out there who might not keep abreast of this to go download it Immediately.

47
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's probably not gonna be a Windows update.

48
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:38,160
Speaker 1: It's probably gonna be a hotfix that you can get you know, so the hotfix is the quickest safest way.

49
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:40,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, just there's a link on slash dot.

50
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:48,467
Speaker 0: I can't follow it because I run Firefox and Linux and it it notices that and doesn't let me see but you need this Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:52,699
Speaker 0: I mean We talked it up and I'm not gonna talk about it more other than that.

52
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,142
Speaker 0: This is a terrible problem that will screw you if you don't get it fixed Hmm.

53
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,858
Speaker 1: Well, when did we first notice this problem?

54
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:04,979
Speaker 1: About a week ago if that so they fixed it in a week.

55
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:10,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, they fixed it much later than that other guy who just put out a patch that fixed it did.

56
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:16,926
Speaker 1: How fast does it usually take like I don't know Gen 2 Linux to fix a problem.

57
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:19,356
Speaker 0: Yeah about a day at most fair.

58
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:20,300
Speaker 1: How about Firefox?

59
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,467
Speaker 1: When does how long does it take Firefox to fix problems?

60
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:28,900
Speaker 0: Ah, the only problem I was actually aware of But I mean most problems I became aware of them after they were already patched.

61
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,819
Speaker 0: I remember one and it came out and I was like crap.

62
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:34,048
Speaker 0: Now the Internet's dangerous.

63
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,538
Speaker 0: and then a patch came out like two days later.

64
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,129
Speaker 1: Hmm Microsoft is lose.

65
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:44,240
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, though I did find out one interesting thing about this exploit and this is the last thing I really have to say about it.

66
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:46,839
Speaker 0: Do you realize that it's not a bug?

67
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,046
Speaker 1: Well, it's not a bug it's a.

68
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:54,226
Speaker 0: it's a flaw or no, it wasn't really even a flaw It's not.

69
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:56,380
Speaker 0: it wasn't like a buffer overflow or anything you'd expect.

70
00:04:56,962 --> 00:05:04,693
Speaker 0: it was a feature that was built into the WF parsing stuff a long long long long time ago and Just no one remembered.

71
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:05,137
Speaker 0: It was there.

72
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:06,859
Speaker 1: So what?

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,832
Speaker 1: What was someone supposed to use this for this feature as best I can tell.

74
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:14,280
Speaker 0: I just kind of cursorily glanced over it.

75
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:20,269
Speaker 0: It was a function you could call within WMF To escape and then run a process.

76
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:25,207
Speaker 1: So it's an image file format But it's a meta file.

77
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:25,528
Speaker 0: I mean it.

78
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,419
Speaker 0: I think that it looks like you can store other data in.

79
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:36,433
Speaker 1: it Seems to be a very broad file format Mm-hmm, you know, I've never actually seen anyone use them heavily.

80
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:40,306
Speaker 0: So no, I mean I saw Heavily Visual Basic uses.

81
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:42,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was about to say when I used to write Visual Basic crap.

82
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:52,779
Speaker 0: back at RIT I used a lot of WMF files Hmm and a lot of really poorly written applications that I get from third-party developers at work have WMF files like embedded in them.

83
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:55,146
Speaker 0: But other than that, they're.

84
00:05:55,347 --> 00:06:03,335
Speaker 0: they're only in the wild if someone's trying to get you with this exploit, basically Yeah, if you make your website with WMF files, you've got issues.

85
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:08,067
Speaker 1: Yeah use use pings Pings and JPEGs and gifs.

86
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:12,506
Speaker 0: Yeah, we won't say Jeff even though it's technically correct technically correct Which there was a guide about.

87
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:15,120
Speaker 1: they got popular recently about the pronunciation anyway.

88
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:18,732
Speaker 1: So the consumer electronic show was currently happening in Las Vegas.

89
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:24,660
Speaker 1: Ah means lots and lots of Electronic goodies for us to look at anything interesting.

90
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:25,923
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

91
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:30,596
Speaker 1: Most of it was just new cell phone new camcorder new cell phone.

92
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:31,217
Speaker 1: Yeah.

93
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:31,358
Speaker 1: Yeah.

94
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:36,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever great Oh that kind of stuff, but there were two things that caught my eye because they were new and interesting.

95
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:42,723
Speaker 1: The first one was this Phillips LCD screen.

96
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:43,727
Speaker 1: that's flat.

97
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,288
Speaker 1: Of course.

98
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:47,580
Speaker 1: It's an LCD screen and it goes on a table and faces up.

99
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:48,845
Speaker 0: Isn't it also touchable?

100
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:55,720
Speaker 1: It's a touchscreen also and it can also detect other things Like little cubes that rest on it and their positions.

101
00:06:56,701 --> 00:07:03,965
Speaker 0: Now I assume that Phillips has some stupid ideas about what they like to use it for but I have three words Dungeons and dragons.

102
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:04,948
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

103
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:06,935
Speaker 0: I have one more word battle tech.

104
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:08,199
Speaker 1: So that's another one.

105
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:26,160
Speaker 1: Actually the demonstration that I see here it looks like a normal You know roll the dice move around the board kind of game but It has a theme of like taxi cabs driving around a city and they have these nice Translucent cubes moving around that you can move around the board.

106
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:31,863
Speaker 1: you can touch the board to like select where you want to go or what you want to do and That's pretty cool.

107
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:36,720
Speaker 1: I mean you wouldn't have to bother like publishing and buying $40 board games anymore.

108
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,159
Speaker 1: We could just buy one of these things, you know when it becomes cheap enough because it sure not cheap enough right now.

109
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,679
Speaker 1: Nope, it's gonna be thousands of dollars right now.

110
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:51,482
Speaker 1: But in the future, you know These things are probably pretty cheap and then we'll be able to just download and program board games for it whether they want us To or not.

111
00:07:51,943 --> 00:07:55,535
Speaker 0: Yeah, because pretty much one of the main things that slows down our board gaming

112
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:57,341
Speaker 1: cleaning up resetting it Yep,

113
00:07:57,622 --> 00:08:03,911
Speaker 0: or even getting it out because Puerto Rico we used to play that like years ago and over the summers We had nothing to do 10 20 times a day

114
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:05,627
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm

115
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:07,228
Speaker 0: and Pretty much.

116
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:10,329
Speaker 0: we spent about as much time Resetting and cleaning up the game as we did playing.

117
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,680
Speaker 1: not only that but think about this rules enforcement.

118
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:15,177
Speaker 1: You won't mess up rules because the game will know.

119
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:26,358
Speaker 0: yeah No matter how tired you get you can't accidentally buy like seven heroes at the end of San Juan Yep, and you won't be any question like people looking at other people's stuff or anything kind of.

120
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:27,000
Speaker 1: it'll be perfect.

121
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,620
Speaker 1: Absolutely solve every board game problem that ever existed like the occasional game of Tigers and Euphrates.

122
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:32,423
Speaker 0: We'd have word.

123
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:36,058
Speaker 0: like three quarters of the way through the game someone looks and there's like a red tile on a river.

124
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:38,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're like who the hell put that there.

125
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, that won't happen.

126
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,159
Speaker 1: So I'm looking forward to this maybe a few years down the road possible.

127
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,749
Speaker 0: I have to be real big though.

128
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,407
Speaker 0: living room installment for sure Like I'd like a coffee table size one.

129
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,255
Speaker 1: This one looks pretty big.

130
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:57,019
Speaker 1: you could probably play Like monopoly on it and if you can play monopoly on it, you can play most German games on it.

131
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,309
Speaker 1: Yep, I don't know about battle tech unless you have some sort of zooming in and zooming out But they could make it bigger.

132
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:03,938
Speaker 1: I mean LCDs are getting bigger every day.

133
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:13,279
Speaker 1: The other thing is something that at first I glossed over But then came back to and realized why this is the big news of the day.

134
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:17,937
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, Sony come out with this e-reader device.

135
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:21,960
Speaker 0: All right I'll say right now that I have pretty much zero interest in e-readers.

136
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:27,179
Speaker 1: I also had zero interest in e-readers and ebooks because they said what the hell I like reading a regular book.

137
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:33,720
Speaker 0: better I mean, I had a nice PDA a while ago till I sat on it and I used to use it like back at RIT.

138
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,379
Speaker 0: I'd put textbooks on it that I didn't want to pay for.

139
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,835
Speaker 0: that I found online and then I just kind of read them.

140
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:43,550
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and It really just hurt my eyes was a pain in the ass and socks.

141
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:43,892
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

142
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:46,139
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and I agree with all those things.

143
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,388
Speaker 1: however, this e-reader Is amazing and let me explain why.

144
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:56,782
Speaker 0: is it magic nano paper where it feels like a real book and I can just flip the Forever.

145
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:57,984
Speaker 1: No, in fact, that's.

146
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:05,559
Speaker 1: it's one flaw is that it's actually still like an electronic device with buttons and everything But it's not too thick.

147
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:11,994
Speaker 1: It's actually a good thickness you know thinner than most laptops and it's about the right size you would want.

148
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:22,537
Speaker 1: where the screen is about the size of manga and the device itself is only a slightly wider than that maybe like a half inch on either side and like an inch and a Half on the bottom where the buttons are.

149
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:29,160
Speaker 1: The awesomeness of it is that it's still black and white which is kind of a but for reading books.

150
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,747
Speaker 1: Who cares is that?

151
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:41,466
Speaker 1: everyone who's seen it and every picture I see of it the completely normal black and white screen is as paper No eye hurting.

152
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,435
Speaker 1: No no LCD.

153
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:44,138
Speaker 1: No CRT.

154
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:44,801
Speaker 1: No nothing It's.

155
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:50,560
Speaker 1: it's this amazing new screen technology and it looks like paper and it hurt doesn't hurt your eyes.

156
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:53,799
Speaker 1: It's like as you're reading paper, is it luminescent at all?

157
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:57,679
Speaker 1: The problem with it is that there's no backlight so you can't read in the dark without a light.

158
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,446
Speaker 1: Aha, but other than that it Terms of your eyes and the pain.

159
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:04,369
Speaker 1: it's as paper.

160
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:07,940
Speaker 1: now that alone is not enough to make it amazing.

161
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:16,106
Speaker 1: The amazing part is that even though it's an evil Sony device It's going to be wide Freaking open.

162
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:20,589
Speaker 1: you're not going to be able to only read special Drmd ebooks on here.

163
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:22,619
Speaker 1: you're gonna be able to load PDFs on here.

164
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:40,156
Speaker 1: If you try to load a document file on there, it'll convert it to a PDF The software will support like if you put an RSS feed it'll automatically download like the articles from the RSS feed and Turn them into PDFs and put them on here so you could just plug it in.

165
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:44,540
Speaker 1: wake up in the morning Take it get on the train and go and the newspaper will be on there.

166
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,691
Speaker 1: Well, you're you know, you're constructed.

167
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:52,914
Speaker 1: internet newspaper will be on there Just to read as if it was paper in black and white, of course, but whatever.

168
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:54,600
Speaker 1: now you're ready for the killer.

169
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:56,798
Speaker 1: Is the killer?

170
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:03,780
Speaker 1: They were demonstrating something to read on here and you know what the demo image was.

171
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:06,000
Speaker 0: Call it Cthulhu.

172
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:11,013
Speaker 1: No the Trigon manga Really?

173
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:12,640
Speaker 1: Tokyo pop.

174
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:18,000
Speaker 0: All right, I see now the potential and the potential is cancellations.

175
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:21,529
Speaker 1: That's a good potential but Tokyo pop.

176
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:22,633
Speaker 1: I don't know the.

177
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:27,191
Speaker 1: I know the Trigon manga from Dark Horse But Tokyo pop is already publicly announced.

178
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,240
Speaker 1: They have fully signed on to this device.

179
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:47,319
Speaker 1: you will be able to soon get digital Tokyo pop manga and read them on this thing and I think that's awesome because the number one problem I have with manga is Storing it all and if I can store it on a hard drive and read it on one handy-dandy device That's worth at least a hundred bucks.

180
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:49,932
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it just comes down to how much it costs.

181
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:57,520
Speaker 1: then right now The guesstimates are between three and four hundred but I say I'll wait for the second generation of the device and it'll be probably one 200.

182
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,674
Speaker 0: yeah, I pay about 150 for that.

183
00:12:59,774 --> 00:13:04,053
Speaker 1: now that I think about it And I think that's what it's going to be when the second generation of the device comes out.

184
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:10,034
Speaker 1: So evil Sony Is one good thing they've got going as some potential.

185
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,280
Speaker 0: I can't believe that's Sony.

186
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:16,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't like one of the few tiny non evil branches of Sony.

187
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,877
Speaker 1: That's the problem with such a big corporation is that you know different parts of it are good and different parts are bad.

188
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:26,100
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, but if you don't believe me just look at some of the pictures of this thing.

189
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:30,040
Speaker 1: You can tell from the photographs that the screen is like awesome like paper.

190
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:38,026
Speaker 1: It's great and the controls look like you can actually you know Go forward and backward through the book sensibly which is important.

191
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:49,966
Speaker 0: So as all of you know, I read Fark and A little while ago since was the new year.

192
00:13:49,986 --> 00:14:00,820
Speaker 0: They had a contest for the best Photoshop of 2005 and I got to say many of them are very hilarious and I have linked to the collection of the winners.

193
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:07,422
Speaker 1: it's a good thing this is a collection because Usually when you look at the Fark photoshops They don't.

194
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:12,600
Speaker 1: they're not filtered very well and it's like 90% crap and there's very few good ones.

195
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:17,790
Speaker 1: So when it's a good thing that they did this because now you can tell the good ones in one place Yep, it's not like something awful.

196
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:28,310
Speaker 1: where they have like the perfect moderation Yeah and only the really good ones get shown except for the ones that are in the Hall of Shame which Get sure usually also hilarious for other reasons because they're in the Hall of Shame.

197
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:34,285
Speaker 1: yep, it's a also worth 1000 I think has a big list of theirs.

198
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:39,324
Speaker 1: usually they go for the Skill in photoshopping and not so much the funniness.

199
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:40,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they also have the funniness.

200
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:53,530
Speaker 0: I found it funny that the number one like by a significant margin Was one making fun of the intelligent design people great and a flying spaghetti monster was there And a whole bunch making fun of good old George W.

201
00:14:57,172 --> 00:15:08,044
Speaker 1: It's just so easy to make those jokes, yeah alright, so We all like art exhibits and art museums and things right?

202
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:08,906
Speaker 1: Yes.

203
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:17,057
Speaker 1: No, maybe anyway This one I'm sure everyone will like because it consists of art Based on old-school video gaming.

204
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:18,722
Speaker 1: the name of it is called.

205
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:22,964
Speaker 1: I am 8-bit and it's gonna be on display I think in San Francisco or something.

206
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:31,110
Speaker 1: I don't know But if you go to their website There's a cool gallery showing some of the arts that will be at the show and some of them are quite awesome.

207
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:37,010
Speaker 1: My favorite is this one where Dig Dug is like standing there inflating the giant lizard with a little pump.

208
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:44,449
Speaker 0: I gotta say I wasn't too impressed with the Promo art for this because I saw it, but it looks like it might be cool.

209
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:47,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, if the show was nearby I would totally go like in a second

210
00:15:48,849 --> 00:16:06,969
Speaker 0: though There was that one time when I went to a gallery with Emily in New York City Just a random gallery and we're looking at art and in the bottom left corner of one of them Was and this is kind of random because it's not what I expected to see at all The mascot to my the anime club I ran at RIT was Mezinger Z

211
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:08,512
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

212
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:17,390
Speaker 0: and in the bottom right hand corner of this random piece of art was a very obvious picture of Mezinger Z And it was raping some other robot from behind.

213
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:20,396
Speaker 1: Well, that's what Mezinger Z does you see?

214
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:21,278
Speaker 0: aha.

215
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:22,922
Speaker 0: So I've never actually seen Mezinger Z.

216
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:32,319
Speaker 1: Ah, I haven't seen much Mezinger Z. It's not something you really Want to watch all of.

217
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,989
Speaker 0: yeah, it's one of those shows.

218
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:49,050
Speaker 1: it's a very old-school robot show and really there are very few old-school robot shows that you should watch all of and You could watch a few Mezinger Z episodes just to be all cool and old-school, but I totally don't recommend watching the whole thing.

219
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:53,723
Speaker 0: Though speaking of old-school we decided since we had nothing better to talk about today.

220
00:16:53,743 --> 00:17:02,658
Speaker 0: We were going to reminisce about All those old TV shows we used to watch when we were little because we don't watch TV anymore Yeah, and we realized there's a lot of these shows.

221
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,230
Speaker 0: So we pretty much just picked the ones that are all from a common-ish era And we picked the ones from our early childhood.

222
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:14,310
Speaker 1: We left the middle school and late elementary like the late elementary school was the cutoff pretty much.

223
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,221
Speaker 0: So we're not talking about Ren and Stimpy or Simpsons or anything just yet.

224
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:19,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we'll talk about those some other day.

225
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:20,674
Speaker 1: Oh, thanks.

226
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:22,781
Speaker 1: Since those are more recent and we have more memory of them.

227
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:26,756
Speaker 1: They could probably take up whole shows on their own Though we figured we'd start.

228
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:27,920
Speaker 0: we just kind of picked an order here.

229
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:29,586
Speaker 0: good old Sesame Street.

230
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,896
Speaker 1: Ah Sesame Street taught me everything.

231
00:17:32,957 --> 00:17:33,257
Speaker 1: Yep.

232
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:34,722
Speaker 1: I remember nursery school.

233
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:37,470
Speaker 0: I learned how to count to ten in Spanish and French.

234
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:39,035
Speaker 1: Mmm, me too.

235
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:40,907
Speaker 1: I also learned how to eat cookies.

236
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,438
Speaker 0: I gotta say there need to be more shows like that.

237
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:54,810
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess I was lucky that my parents were smart and They made me watch Sesame Street, and I guess I was lucky that I was smart enough to enjoy it thoroughly.

238
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:56,816
Speaker 1: I agree with both those things.

239
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:12,689
Speaker 1: It's also kind of funny how even today like Some of the things from Sesame Street if I see them now It's not like it doesn't feel like a dumb like I see dumb kids shows on TV or if I watch Sesame Street today Or it all started like when that Barney came out, right?

240
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,006
Speaker 1: Then kids shows started getting dumb and painful to watch Teletubbies.

241
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:17,790
Speaker 1: Yeah stuff like that.

242
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,303
Speaker 1: But I can still watch the Sesame Street that I watched when I was a kid.

243
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:24,314
Speaker 1: if I watch it now It's not painful.

244
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,519
Speaker 1: And in fact, it's awesome.

245
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if that's because of nostalgia.

246
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:35,190
Speaker 1: It could be because of nostalgia for it and you know, like memories that it invokes.

247
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:43,761
Speaker 1: But I'm pretty sure it isn't because I'm nostalgic for some other TV shows from my childhood and watching them now is just painful.

248
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:46,910
Speaker 1: So the fact that Sesame Street isn't painful really says something.

249
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,390
Speaker 0: I just really wish it was more popular.

250
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:52,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, it used to be huge popular.

251
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,149
Speaker 1: Like it was the only show for little kids.

252
00:18:54,209 --> 00:19:01,830
Speaker 1: now There's just so much competition that you know The people who do the heavy marketing instead of the nonprofit people trying to be intelligent, you know.

253
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,524
Speaker 0: Yes, I noticed that I mean the two other shows that were educational that we watched.

254
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:07,066
Speaker 0: we were kids.

255
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:08,993
Speaker 0: square one and three to one Contact.

256
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:09,776
Speaker 0: Yes square one.

257
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:10,378
Speaker 0: I don't think either.

258
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,182
Speaker 0: one is still around.

259
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:13,412
Speaker 1: square one didn't last very long at all But it was.

260
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:14,377
Speaker 1: it was so amazing.

261
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:15,060
Speaker 1: I can't believe.

262
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:23,027
Speaker 0: you know, in fact, I remember when I was a little kid I'd get into arguments my friends at school because none of them had heard of or watched square one and they all watch three to one contact.

263
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, didn't watch three to one contact.

264
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,040
Speaker 1: that much like.

265
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,077
Speaker 1: I remember it coming on and I remember about it But I never don't really remember anything from it.

266
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:32,840
Speaker 1: square one.

267
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,707
Speaker 1: I remember vividly certain parts.

268
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:43,173
Speaker 1: Yep Especially that episode where they talked about negative numbers because I didn't know anything about negative numbers less than zero less or hero Yeah, that one.

269
00:19:43,193 --> 00:19:47,930
Speaker 0: I remember the song and everything because I remember he goes to throw the javelin and it goes backwards.

270
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're like, oh The thing was that I knew about.

271
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:56,690
Speaker 1: I knew that there was a such thing as negative numbers But I didn't quite get it until I watched that episode and I was just like enlightenment.

272
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:07,905
Speaker 0: I remember in particular the one about fractions where the guy had a key ring with eight keys and he was two of them and then he had Six out of eight keys left and I was like, oh that's what fractions are

273
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:15,627
Speaker 1: the one about Percentages where they go into like the store and he's like, yeah you take off some number percent get it.

274
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,659
Speaker 1: Oh I know what the percent sign means now.

275
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,070
Speaker 0: I mean that show really didn't pander to kids at all.

276
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,505
Speaker 0: It was just like alright, here's here's learning.

277
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:26,289
Speaker 0: Here's our alert.

278
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,303
Speaker 1: here We're gonna teach you all the math that you will learn throughout elementary school.

279
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:33,750
Speaker 0: in one TV show man I know we're watching watch his name running away from the tornado guy.

280
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:38,227
Speaker 1: Oh my god That was the absolute best part of the show and it was also the absolute worst part of the show.

281
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:39,555
Speaker 0: cuz he'd be go he's like He's going strong.

282
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:41,270
Speaker 0: He's going strong and then he'd be like, oh don't eat.

283
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:44,410
Speaker 1: It was so great because you love video games and you love pac-man.

284
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:50,720
Speaker 1: so watching that was the same kind of feeling you get now when you see cool internet videos and things and It was just my most.

285
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:51,368
Speaker 1: I waited it.

286
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:58,930
Speaker 1: I waited for that part of the show more than any other part But the guy was so dumb and he always got eaten by the tornado and I was always pissed off.

287
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:01,770
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure there were a couple times where he got away.

288
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:03,056
Speaker 1: You know what?

289
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:12,276
Speaker 1: I don't remember it that well but if anyone can get videos of maybe him succeeding at the puzzle or the tornado getting screwed, but Actually, I thought the tornado was cute.

290
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:16,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, my other favorite part was actually the the math squad at the end.

291
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,569
Speaker 1: Well, it was uh, what was it called?

292
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,023
Speaker 0: Math net math net cuz I remembered you guys realized that there was a movie to that.

293
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:25,186
Speaker 1: Was there really?

294
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:26,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have to get it.

295
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,555
Speaker 0: I had it on tape.

296
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:32,962
Speaker 0: So when I fly out to Arizona to see my mom, I'll see if she still has it We have to get that is on Netflix.

297
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:33,747
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

298
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:34,229
Speaker 0: I'll look.

299
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:36,883
Speaker 1: I'm gonna check eBay as soon as we're done here.

300
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:48,369
Speaker 0: because that movie it was actually kind of cool because I remember watching it and it was about a lottery scan and All I remember thinking I was a kid was wow I should pull that scan because there's no one that smart in the real world to stop me.

301
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:51,605
Speaker 1: Yep The thing about math net was like at first.

302
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,397
Speaker 1: when I would watch Square one math net would come on.

303
00:21:54,417 --> 00:22:01,809
Speaker 1: it was always be the last thing in the show and it would be like five minutes long And it would start and I remember the opener seemed real boring.

304
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,222
Speaker 1: It's like at first.

305
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:04,070
Speaker 1: I just didn't watch it.

306
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,728
Speaker 1: I would just turn off the show right there because I only wanted to see the funny cartoon bits and you know the math pac-man guy.

307
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:18,797
Speaker 1: but then I finally watched it one day and I was like Yeah, this is the good The thing is as a little kid.

308
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:19,982
Speaker 0: I took it at face value.

309
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:25,970
Speaker 0: Like I didn't realize it was supposed to be a joke I just took it like wow, they're awesome mathematicians and they solve crimes.

310
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:37,209
Speaker 1: see the way I took it was that the first part of the show was to teach you new maths that you didn't already know and That the math net was the part where they showed you how the math was actually useful in the real world.

311
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:37,590
Speaker 1: somehow.

312
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and that's that's what it was about.

313
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:43,150
Speaker 0: So though the region one contact had a similar thing.

314
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,367
Speaker 0: They had the bloodhound gang that always came on like right at the end or right after.

315
00:22:46,568 --> 00:22:48,750
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, which I watch.

316
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:55,192
Speaker 0: I didn't like it that much mostly because I thought the kids were dumb and they could have gotten out of the situations in easier Ways.

317
00:22:55,755 --> 00:23:14,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, I always hated things like that were whenever you The problem with educational shows that if you've already learned the education, but you want to be educated instead of just you know Nostalgic or something that if they're doing something that you know is dumb or they're not figuring it out as fast as you did It's just painful to watch.

318
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:15,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, like they'd be going.

319
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:23,138
Speaker 0: I mean it was kind of a gritty show for little kids learning about things because they go after like drug dealers Kidnappers they get kidnapped they get beat up.

320
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:26,450
Speaker 0: Yep, and I just remember I'd always think why don't they just call the cops?

321
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,475
Speaker 0: They know where the drug dealers are.

322
00:23:27,515 --> 00:23:29,745
Speaker 0: They're still there and they have drugs weren't they the cops?

323
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:30,950
Speaker 1: they were real detectives, right?

324
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,114
Speaker 1: They were just math detectives.

325
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:35,246
Speaker 0: What no, no, no in through, you know, the bloodhound gang.

326
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:35,828
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

327
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:39,160
Speaker 0: Yeah They were like little punk inner-city kids.

328
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:41,488
Speaker 1: Yeah, they should have called the kids like sticks for weapons.

329
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:43,373
Speaker 1: if that Yeah, that was whatever.

330
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:44,496
Speaker 1: not much you can do about that.

331
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:45,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was still a good show.

332
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:46,219
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

333
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:49,138
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's it for the educational.

334
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:50,022
Speaker 1: Oh, well, we'll talk about mr.

335
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,168
Speaker 1: Rogers a little bit actually.

336
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:55,889
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, mr Rogers, I never really liked it that much but I used to watch it mostly because my little brother wanted to watch it.

337
00:23:56,312 --> 00:23:58,275
Speaker 1: See, uh Parts of mr.

338
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:04,370
Speaker 1: Rogers were kind of painful and parts of it were kind of great like When he was just hanging out in his living room.

339
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:07,089
Speaker 1: It was usually kind of boring because he was just talking about something dumb.

340
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:14,075
Speaker 1: But like whenever he went into the backyard where the sandbox was that meant he was going to do something kind of like a science Experiment and that was always cool.

341
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:15,701
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz I always loved science.

342
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:16,604
Speaker 0: He shows like mr.

343
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:17,126
Speaker 0: Wizard.

344
00:24:17,146 --> 00:24:17,447
Speaker 1: No, mr.

345
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:23,050
Speaker 1: Wizard Yeah But the part where he said the little trolley into the land of make-believe.

346
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:25,982
Speaker 1: Like half the time it was cool and half the time it sucked.

347
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:36,927
Speaker 1: because depending on what puppets he pulled out Like I remember there was like an owl puppet that was way cool and like the king was way cool But like there was like a bird or some kind of animals and they weren't cool.

348
00:24:36,947 --> 00:24:37,630
Speaker 1: They were just stupid.

349
00:24:38,491 --> 00:24:46,670
Speaker 0: So like depending on what the story was dependent how much I enjoyed that part of the show I remember I was fascinated with the fact that he had a traffic light and I wanted a traffic light.

350
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:54,292
Speaker 0: Hmm yeah, yeah, that's my main memory of that show is wanting that traffic light All right.

351
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:57,745
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember my parents eventually got me a toy traffic light.

352
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:01,083
Speaker 1: It was freaking awesome, dude I had a toy Fisher Price Main Street.

353
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,110
Speaker 1: That was the best freakin toy.

354
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,467
Speaker 1: Let me know you could drive a little mailman around town and put the mail in the mail slots.

355
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:08,937
Speaker 0: Oh, dude I didn't have that but my cousins did.

356
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:11,950
Speaker 1: I could put the mail in the mail slots all day long.

357
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:15,190
Speaker 1: The firemen got a lot of mail because they had the easiest mail slot.

358
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,589
Speaker 1: Let me tell you that was a good toy.

359
00:25:19,531 --> 00:25:25,874
Speaker 1: All right now that will do the non-educational shows the dreck It's not real.

360
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:26,558
Speaker 1: some of its drag.

361
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of its drug transformers was only kind of drag.

362
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:32,680
Speaker 1: The thing about transformers is that has a lot of plot holes.

363
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:40,210
Speaker 1: It has a lot of animation glitches a lot of corniness But it's and it was made only to sell toys and not to be a good show.

364
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:44,363
Speaker 0: Yes, and like for all of you don't know specifically it was designed to sell toys.

365
00:25:44,624 --> 00:25:45,487
Speaker 0: Yeah from the start.

366
00:25:45,507 --> 00:25:47,994
Speaker 1: It wasn't even a joke But you know what.

367
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:51,169
Speaker 1: I can still watch it this day and still get enjoyment out of it.

368
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:52,273
Speaker 0: I can't a little.

369
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:54,822
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember always rooting for Starscream.

370
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:56,026
Speaker 1: Yes, Starscream.

371
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:59,300
Speaker 1: It was so awesome But he always made a dumb mistake that pissed you off.

372
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,601
Speaker 0: Yep.

373
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:01,430
Speaker 0: Rodimus Prime never liked him so much.

374
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,256
Speaker 0: No Bumblebee can go to hell.

375
00:26:03,577 --> 00:26:05,382
Speaker 1: see ya Bumblebee can go to hell.

376
00:26:05,443 --> 00:26:07,108
Speaker 1: I like everyone likes Optimus Prime.

377
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:12,535
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, Megatron like he was cool, but he was just too Stupid.

378
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:24,663
Speaker 1: evil like he wasn't stupid But his evil was stupid like he was just blatantly so evil that he would mess up Yep, but he was also so powerful that he never lost really though.

379
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,612
Speaker 0: I actually didn't watch so much Transformers.

380
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:35,102
Speaker 1: I didn't watch so much of it only I think because of the time slot and the channel it was on But I knew I always liked it and I always wanted to watch.

381
00:26:35,142 --> 00:26:37,150
Speaker 0: well plus I had an odd different similar show.

382
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,038
Speaker 0: That was my favorite though.

383
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:39,026
Speaker 0: We'll get into it in a second.

384
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:42,060
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah transformers is still good.

385
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,886
Speaker 1: the toys were actually better than the show.

386
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:44,368
Speaker 1: I think.

387
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:47,322
Speaker 1: yeah I mean those toys are actually still kind of fun today.

388
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:57,865
Speaker 1: if you get some of them You know you transform them and they shoot and whatever the one show that we all remembered as being awesome and We watched it again.

389
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,823
Speaker 0: He-man is probably the worst thing ever created by humankind.

390
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:10,665
Speaker 1: watching he-man is like stabbing yourself in the eye Especially when you say to yourself I used to watch that and love it.

391
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:14,369
Speaker 0: not only watch it and love it But wanted to see the live-action movie.

392
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:16,333
Speaker 1: There's a live-action.

393
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,777
Speaker 0: Yes, there is he-man.

394
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:23,713
Speaker 0: the movie he-man and man-at-arms and what's-her-name come to earth and In the end the end.

395
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:27,610
Speaker 0: all I remember is that the final guy like that they're fighting is Galator.

396
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,995
Speaker 0: Not it wasn't.

397
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:30,783
Speaker 0: it was kind of it's complicated.

398
00:27:30,803 --> 00:27:32,550
Speaker 0: I have very little recollection of this movie.

399
00:27:33,254 --> 00:27:35,769
Speaker 0: All I remember is that he was defeated with a Casio keyboard.

400
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,121
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

401
00:27:37,464 --> 00:27:44,530
Speaker 1: I'm not kidding right, so I had more he-man action figures than any other type of action figure.

402
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,870
Speaker 1: But I don't actually remember so much of like watching he-man.

403
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:52,449
Speaker 1: I just remember like the castle grayskull and fighting Skeletor and I remember module lock.

404
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:55,542
Speaker 1: module lock was perhaps one of the best toys I ever had.

405
00:27:55,803 --> 00:27:58,895
Speaker 1: you know module lock which one's that He was in.

406
00:27:58,915 --> 00:28:30,589
Speaker 1: like a couple episodes as like this character They created just to sell a toy and it was like this two-headed red guy and the toy came with like two different torsos two heads four arms and like eight legs Some abdomen pieces and some tail pieces and you could create like either one giant module lock creature Or you could create like two separate module lock creatures and you could arrange them in all sorts of different ways To make different things for he-man to fight and it was really cool because in the show they did the same thing.

407
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:37,510
Speaker 0: huh Yeah, but the show if you watch it now is just painful and you know what for anyone out there Shira wasn't any better.

408
00:28:38,831 --> 00:28:40,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was pretty much the same crap.

409
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,384
Speaker 1: Yep only with a girl.

410
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:44,590
Speaker 0: I mean god We're not kidding.

411
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:46,150
Speaker 0: Don't ever watch he-man again.

412
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,976
Speaker 0: That way you can at least maintain those memories and not think that you were just a complete dumb shit when you were a kid I mean like the cat man.

413
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,300
Speaker 1: Oh god the cat.

414
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,310
Speaker 0: He's more annoying than c-3po, but he never gets his comeuppance.

415
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:58,922
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's the other guy Orca?

416
00:28:59,163 --> 00:29:11,049
Speaker 1: Orca, yeah Yeah, okay, whoever was riding he-man Don't let me meet you in a back alley For you know take putting stupidity into my brain when I could have been watching something better.

417
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:16,780
Speaker 0: there's one show that I watched religiously and A lot of my friends a lot of people didn't watch.

418
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:24,566
Speaker 0: it was kind of obscure show though It had in my opinion the best toys of this era associated with it mask mask.

419
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:27,078
Speaker 0: I Watched that show every frickin day.

420
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,530
Speaker 0: I have every single toy in duplicate half of them in mint condition.

421
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:39,810
Speaker 0: Wow, yeah the show upon watching it again was not as stupid as he-man but was definitely not quite what I remembered.

422
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:41,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, that happens.

423
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:52,126
Speaker 1: I mean there were a lot of shows that also were equally obscure that I watched here and there like I don't know bionic six Or that one where there was like a rock Lord's.

424
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:52,890
Speaker 1: I have a rock.

425
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:57,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually the rock the rock Lord toys were kind of cool, but the show now not at all.

426
00:29:57,266 --> 00:30:01,301
Speaker 1: centurions Centurions also, I was a centurion for Halloween one.

427
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:01,864
Speaker 0: So was I?

428
00:30:01,905 --> 00:30:02,930
Speaker 0: I had the blue guys cost.

429
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,310
Speaker 0: I had the yellow guy Because it came with this red rocket that didn't fire.

430
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:09,110
Speaker 0: I'd it was on the gun and to fire it you took it off and threw it.

431
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,417
Speaker 1: No, mine didn't come with anything.

432
00:30:10,438 --> 00:30:12,510
Speaker 0: I was lame and it came with like a rocket thing.

433
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:14,839
Speaker 1: I must add the cheaper costume.

434
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:16,770
Speaker 1: mine was just like a vinyl suit and a plastic mask.

435
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:19,119
Speaker 0: Mine came with a helmet like a big plastic one.

436
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:19,601
Speaker 1: Oh, you got it.

437
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:20,866
Speaker 1: You had the more expensive costume.

438
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:21,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was awesome.

439
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:23,142
Speaker 0: I played with it until it broke.

440
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:26,462
Speaker 0: Yeah But mask for any of you out here who watched it.

441
00:30:26,522 --> 00:30:31,229
Speaker 0: and if any of you out there watched it Let me know because I really want to find other people who love this show.

442
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:33,194
Speaker 0: Mmm, it was really cool.

443
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:43,884
Speaker 0: Imagine transformers only better animated slightly with a better plot at least for the first half of the show and Cool, cool cool transforming things that fight with each other.

444
00:30:43,904 --> 00:30:50,350
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Do you remember a show where there would be like ropes in a canyon and vehicles would slide back and forth along the ropes?

445
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,950
Speaker 0: I remember seeing commercials for the toys and then not thinking not knowing there was a show associated.

446
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,630
Speaker 1: I think I watched the show like on Saturday morning twice and I had one of the toys and it broke.

447
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:01,270
Speaker 0: I had a friend who had all the toys.

448
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:05,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had a friend who had a whole bunch of them like all around his ceiling and you'd slide him back and forth.

449
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,270
Speaker 1: They'd shoot missiles.

450
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,650
Speaker 0: See, I think I had the best setup because I had all the Ninja Turtles toys, but the Ninja Turtles themselves socks.

451
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:13,550
Speaker 0: But the the places they had like the technodrome were awesome.

452
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:16,781
Speaker 0: So I use my mass guys who fit in those place.

453
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:17,585
Speaker 0: that's a lot better.

454
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:18,810
Speaker 0: and I had like the ultimate setup.

455
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:20,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was always upset that I got.

456
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:28,469
Speaker 1: I got plenty of action figures but I never got like you would always want like 20 of the normal henchmen or foot soldiers and you never got that.

457
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:38,950
Speaker 1: and I only ever got one place other than you know, fisher-price Main Street To play with my action figures in and I think I still have it at my house.

458
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:41,236
Speaker 1: Maybe I should go get it But I never got like.

459
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:46,858
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what the place is when we talk about the show by the way Because I had Boulder Mountain from mask.

460
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,590
Speaker 0: I had the the turn Ninja Turtles underground sewer and the technodrome.

461
00:31:50,813 --> 00:31:51,625
Speaker 1: No didn't have any of those.

462
00:31:52,572 --> 00:32:00,862
Speaker 1: My brother had the Ninja Turtles van actually eventually, which folded out into a nice playset Micro-machines I had like every friggin micro-machines.

463
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:02,470
Speaker 1: Oh, we had a shit ton of micro-machines.

464
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:10,909
Speaker 1: The problem is when they switched the standard for micro-machine playsets from you know, those squares and they would fold in half Yep, they would attach to each other to make cities.

465
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:16,963
Speaker 1: but then they got rid of that and there was like This big van that folded out to make a giant city.

466
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:17,445
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

467
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:18,932
Speaker 0: I remember when the van came out I got it.

468
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:21,662
Speaker 0: I was like what the hell and I stopped buying micro-machines.

469
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:26,745
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had the van and oh Maybe my brother had the micro-machines van and not the Ninja Turtles man.

470
00:32:26,765 --> 00:32:27,729
Speaker 1: I think that was it.

471
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:32,689
Speaker 1: Yeah And it folded out into this great city and then I had my little squares that lock together down low.

472
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:35,670
Speaker 0: Of course micro-machines were far inferior to the older Hot Wheels.

473
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:37,750
Speaker 1: I had plenty of Hot Wheels and matchbox car.

474
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,445
Speaker 0: I had all four sets like the big like with the ramp, you know, they're all kind of identical.

475
00:32:41,465 --> 00:32:46,210
Speaker 1: Oh I only ever had just one loop-de-loop and I got rid of it pretty quickly.

476
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,763
Speaker 1: But I had lots of fun just playing with the cars on their own and on the floor.

477
00:32:49,944 --> 00:32:50,185
Speaker 0: Yep.

478
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:50,426
Speaker 0: Yep.

479
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:51,911
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

480
00:32:51,931 --> 00:32:54,341
Speaker 1: I was a fan of the Hot Wheels or matchbox.

481
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:55,807
Speaker 1: I guess I couldn't know difference.

482
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,513
Speaker 0: Yeah I really had no idea.

483
00:32:57,553 --> 00:32:59,501
Speaker 0: I had cars that were all kind of that size.

484
00:32:59,802 --> 00:33:01,690
Speaker 1: Yep, and of course they had big Tonka trucks.

485
00:33:02,192 --> 00:33:03,660
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but enough about toys.

486
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,886
Speaker 0: I will do a show on toys.

487
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:11,872
Speaker 1: one of the shows I watched when I was a kid that I can still watch today and still enjoy greatly is Voltron.

488
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:15,045
Speaker 0: see I didn't like it so much, but it's definitely not that bad.

489
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:16,612
Speaker 1: Voltron is great It's.

490
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:16,874
Speaker 1: it's.

491
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:19,070
Speaker 1: it's a you know, it's a standard Sentai show.

492
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:28,733
Speaker 1: You know a bunch of guys group up to form Voltron or talk about lion Voltron, by the way If you like car Voltron, you can shove it where the Sun don't shine You know.

493
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:38,878
Speaker 1: and it had all this this great space epic plot that never got you know, like developed enough You know, like they could really go somewhere with it.

494
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:46,510
Speaker 1: And in fact, there's a semi-recent comic book that does go somewhere with it but It was just way cool.

495
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:54,537
Speaker 1: There was like a castle and they had to defend the villagers and the one thing that made it really adult was there was a guy Sven and he started out on the team.

496
00:33:54,577 --> 00:34:05,750
Speaker 1: He was Sven the guy who talked like he was, you know named as fan but then like After a few episodes through the show like either he was a traitor or he died or something like that.

497
00:34:05,831 --> 00:34:10,949
Speaker 1: and it was really sort of The intelligent kind of plot thing that the other shows didn't have.

498
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:14,550
Speaker 1: And that's how the princess took his seat in Voltron.

499
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,737
Speaker 0: That explains that.

500
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:26,024
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz I was remember looking around and always One more guy In a suit than there were places to sit in a suit.

501
00:34:26,324 --> 00:34:27,350
Speaker 0: I was wondering what was up with that?

502
00:34:27,571 --> 00:34:31,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, the best thing about Voltron was when they got in Voltron they would go down these tubes and they would go.

503
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,925
Speaker 1: it was way cool and The music was cool, too.

504
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:45,465
Speaker 0: And of course the last show which we upon watching it again with adult eyes Realized was much more sexually charged than we had thought.

505
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:51,987
Speaker 1: it's not sexually charged It's a story about adolescence and puberty, which I guess makes it indirectly sexually.

506
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:54,983
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, just freaking the sword growing.

507
00:34:55,003 --> 00:34:55,063
Speaker 0: Yep.

508
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:59,529
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, you don't know what show we're talking about.

509
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:00,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, already.

510
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:04,449
Speaker 0: I remember cuz I never actually seen the first episode of Thundercats until recently.

511
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:10,798
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm like all the rest of it and I knew what was going on But watching the first one all I remember thinking was Wow.

512
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,045
Speaker 0: Chitara is naked pretty much.

513
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:18,003
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Love the Thundercats probably more than and I remember it more than any other show.

514
00:35:18,204 --> 00:35:19,770
Speaker 1: and that's the place that I had.

515
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,508
Speaker 1: I had the giant Thunder Mountain with the big blue head on it that had lights in it and everything.

516
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:25,534
Speaker 0: Oh, wow I didn't have that.

517
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,985
Speaker 1: It's I got it in my attic.

518
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:27,609
Speaker 1: I should go get it.

519
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:31,577
Speaker 1: I don't know where I'm gonna put it in this house but it's a fun toy for sure.

520
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:38,973
Speaker 1: and I used to put the Thundercats all in it different places and I Mean the show is kind of episodic and nonsensical But wasn't really.

521
00:35:39,374 --> 00:35:41,780
Speaker 1: see the thing is it wasn't 100% episodic.

522
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:53,450
Speaker 1: It was like this half episodic half serial type of show like There would be like the first few episodes were all Serial where it was like, oh, this is how the Thundercats got to fun to the new Thunder.

523
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:55,957
Speaker 1: This is how they set up the castle.

524
00:35:56,017 --> 00:36:00,410
Speaker 1: these this is them discovering the different people on the planet.

525
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:05,708
Speaker 1: They don't like the burbles which sucked the mutants which are bad guys mum rah the big bad guy, you know.

526
00:36:06,672 --> 00:36:08,763
Speaker 1: But then it just got into a bunch of episodes.

527
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:10,793
Speaker 1: like mum rah does evil We beat him.

528
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:12,202
Speaker 1: mum rah does evil we beat him.

529
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:13,912
Speaker 1: the mutants do evil we beat them.

530
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:16,299
Speaker 1: the mutants do evil we beat you know, so on and so forth.

531
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:20,848
Speaker 1: and That eventually they started like that.

532
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:27,865
Speaker 1: the plot would change like lino would do like a quest thing to you know Become the real Lord of the Thundercats.

533
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:30,292
Speaker 1: and then people from space would come.

534
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:42,754
Speaker 1: and then they started a plot where they went to the you know back into space and then they came back and then there were new characters and do Thundercats and Then it became more serial again, but I didn't watch those episodes so much.

535
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:44,480
Speaker 1: that was after my time.

536
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,935
Speaker 0: No, I put in our Netflix queue all of Thundercats.

537
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:47,640
Speaker 0: this out on DVD.

538
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,600
Speaker 0: Awesome, so we might actually start doing some reviews of Thundercats specifically.

539
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:58,197
Speaker 0: That'd be so great in months because there are many shows before Thundercats unlike he-man.

540
00:36:58,238 --> 00:36:58,980
Speaker 1: It won't be so painful.

541
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:01,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's get all a he-man and watch it again.

542
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,280
Speaker 1: No, how about we just get like one episode of he-man and that'll be enough.

543
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:06,910
Speaker 0: We'll review that at the same time.

544
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,359
Speaker 0: We review that mahjong show.

545
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,564
Speaker 1: Great.

546
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,038
Speaker 1: I can't wait to watch that.
