00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:33,466
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

9
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:34,591
Speaker 0: a bike home in the rain today?

10
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:36,139
Speaker 1: Oh do you wet a little bit?

11
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:39,720
Speaker 0: I'm glad I got that roll-up fender though because I don't care like I will bike.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,248
Speaker 1: I checked the weather and therefore did not bike.

13
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:45,318
Speaker 0: when I got up the weather said it will rain it like 8 p.m.

14
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:49,300
Speaker 1: When I got up, and I checked the weather it said it will rain on your way home.

15
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:50,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, when did you get up?

16
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:54,605
Speaker 1: cuz I left for work it like not just the way home to here But also the way home from here.

17
00:00:55,027 --> 00:01:00,096
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it would have rained then but when I checked the weather It said no rain is like 8 or 9 p.m..

18
00:01:00,257 --> 00:01:04,938
Speaker 1: Anyway So it's a new year of a bike commuting time.

19
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:17,060
Speaker 1: finally It's warm enough, so I you know my plan was you know I got the road bike But I want to commute on the road bike yeah, and I got you know the new office There's like a bike room, and I managed to get the key to it by by you know luck.

20
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:21,580
Speaker 1: I don't know if anyone else in my office is gonna be able to get a key, but we'll find out anyway.

21
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:26,460
Speaker 1: So I'm like now want to put my nice bike road bike in the bike room.

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,191
Speaker 1: So I'll use my keep using my commuting bike.

23
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:29,520
Speaker 1: and I was like commuting bike.

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,633
Speaker 1: You know it's a little old as 10 years old.

25
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:35,854
Speaker 1: It was only like $500 10 years ago, it's gotten beat up a lot.

26
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:37,160
Speaker 1: the seat has like holes in it.

27
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's always been like an inch too big for me right.

28
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:43,780
Speaker 1: I always needed like one size smaller, but it's still rideable.

29
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:47,185
Speaker 1: You know it still goes Alright, so I'm like.

30
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:49,620
Speaker 1: you know what you know for my last year of this bike.

31
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,080
Speaker 1: I'll take it in and I'll get like some real maintenance.

32
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,477
Speaker 1: So it's super smooth, and I can like drive it like crazy.

33
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:57,365
Speaker 1: this last year I was thinking I'd get a new chain.

34
00:01:57,807 --> 00:01:58,750
Speaker 1: you know make sure the.

35
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:02,998
Speaker 1: you know maybe new brake and shifting cables You know make everything real good.

36
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,675
Speaker 1: You know true the wheels if they need it, so I bring it in.

37
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:07,820
Speaker 1: guy looks at it.

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,388
Speaker 1: We talked about some problems.

39
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,076
Speaker 1: You know and then he's like alright.

40
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:11,820
Speaker 1: I'll work on it later.

41
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:12,887
Speaker 1: He doesn't start working on.

42
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:13,874
Speaker 1: it's like 530 when I get there.

43
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:21,180
Speaker 1: But you know he's going to true the wheel, and he's like well hold up this this rear wheel.

44
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:24,840
Speaker 1: Check this out, and so I thought the rear wheel was out of true.

45
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:26,245
Speaker 1: It actually wasn't.

46
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:32,869
Speaker 1: despite being ten years old both wheels were actually pretty damn true Spoke-wise yeah, because you don't bike that aggressively.

47
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,177
Speaker 0: and especially I'm like a commuter like cheaper bike.

48
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:35,880
Speaker 0: so I could see why.

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,179
Speaker 1: You know, but I only own my wheels cuz I keep popping spokes going in the shitty roads of Manhattan and such.

50
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,396
Speaker 1: anyway He's like the rear axle is broken.

51
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,040
Speaker 1: I'm like what?

52
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:56,659
Speaker 1: So he shows me and is sure enough even though the quick-release skewer is like intact and good Right which is why I didn't have any problems riding or die.

53
00:02:57,626 --> 00:03:03,220
Speaker 1: The skewer was basically holding the wheel together And was keeping it secure on the on the frame.

54
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:11,622
Speaker 1: But the actual axle you could spin the bolt on one side of the wheel and the one on the other side Did not turn.

55
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:20,909
Speaker 1: so this is funny because I go and you can feel that the axle was like two different pieces Inside the wheel not touching each other.

56
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,899
Speaker 0: so I just googled like broken rear axle to try to find like.

57
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,345
Speaker 1: so I didn't bother to do that.

58
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:25,927
Speaker 0: so get this.

59
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:29,520
Speaker 0: the first result is a stack exchange where someone says broken rear axle.

60
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:32,776
Speaker 0: Why does it happen and is it worth trying to repair?

61
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,459
Speaker 0: This is really short?

62
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:35,589
Speaker 0: So I'm taking the time to overhaul my bike.

63
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,079
Speaker 0: whole drivetrain was full of oil road salt, etc.

64
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:40,211
Speaker 0: So I started taking stuff apart.

65
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:45,379
Speaker 0: once I got the back wheel off I ended up with half the rear axle in my hand and a bunch of ball bearings on the floor.

66
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's bait.

67
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:51,786
Speaker 1: the guy was basically telling me like yeah if I go to true the wheel I got to take the skewer out.

68
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:54,300
Speaker 1: if I take the skewer out the wheels gonna fall apart.

69
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:59,789
Speaker 1: And then you had to buy a new wheel, but he's like as long as I don't take it apart It's safe to ride for now.

70
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:09,945
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm like I can ride this home safely, and he's like yeah And I'm like all right do not take my $80 for a tenure to fix a ten-year-old $500 Right just you know.

71
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:13,139
Speaker 1: make sure the brakes are good so I can ride home safely and I'll be on my way.

72
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:18,317
Speaker 0: So I think we're both because I got to replace my rear wheel my cassettes and my chain probably.

73
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:29,175
Speaker 1: so on Saturday I think I'm gonna go to some Brooklyn bike shops that have better selections for the kind of commuting bike I want and Replace my ten-year-old bike with hopefully a bike that will last 20 year.

74
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:30,260
Speaker 0: You can check out.

75
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:31,545
Speaker 1: I still have to bike.

76
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:36,683
Speaker 1: it's worth checking out REI because I doesn't have the kind of commuting bike I'm looking for now.

77
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:37,125
Speaker 0: have you looked?

78
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:41,620
Speaker 0: because they also been there recently because they will also ship bikes in from other re eyes.

79
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:45,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the REI only has like a lot brand and some other.

80
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:47,482
Speaker 1: you know they don't have the kind of bike I'm looking for.

81
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,783
Speaker 0: I've never actually shopped for bikes there because I tend to pick the manufacturer I want.

82
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:53,145
Speaker 0: well.

83
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:55,620
Speaker 1: I don't manufacturers for bikes don't really matter.

84
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,572
Speaker 1: It's like there's actually a ton of manufacturers who make the kind of bike.

85
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:58,953
Speaker 1: I want.

86
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:00,640
Speaker 1: it's the kind yeah, right.

87
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:03,780
Speaker 1: So it's like you know the kind like the kind of bike I have for a road bike.

88
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:13,920
Speaker 1: There's actually tons of choices, but for the commuting bike that I want There's only like maybe you know five or six choices and most of the bike shops don't carry that kind.

89
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:19,040
Speaker 0: I am continuing to idly look at mountain bikes because I'm not getting a road bike.

90
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,905
Speaker 0: I'm just keeping like the road bike performance hybrid that is light like a road bike with the twitchy tires But it's not a road bike.

91
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,410
Speaker 0: It's still got bullshit handlebars.

92
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:30,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, just you know for going a long way.

93
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:31,988
Speaker 1: You know it's yeah.

94
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a reason why I don't do the century.

95
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,960
Speaker 1: There's a reason I got two bikes right to go a long way.

96
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:40,733
Speaker 1: I mean, I can't go a long way even on a better commuting bike.

97
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,980
Speaker 0: I mean really I I'm a perfect world.

98
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:43,945
Speaker 0: I would have three bikes.

99
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:49,211
Speaker 0: I would have a I would have a a full suspension mountain bike I would have a hybrid and I would have a road bike.

100
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:50,798
Speaker 1: you should try you should rent a road bike.

101
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:54,753
Speaker 0: one time I've ridden road bikes before I know the feel but for a long ride.

102
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:56,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought about it.

103
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:58,759
Speaker 0: I found some places that'll random, but it ain't cheap.

104
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,685
Speaker 0: No, it's cheap.

105
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:01,649
Speaker 0: Goodbye.

106
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:09,919
Speaker 0: It's cheap to rent a road bike for like a month But to rent it for like a weekend like one long trip and now worth it ready for a month.

107
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:16,482
Speaker 1: then You could just rent a road bike every summer and always have a great road bike and then a winner you don't need you have To store it.

108
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:16,723
Speaker 0: Yep.

109
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,754
Speaker 0: The real problem is because I primarily ride on mountain bikes and hybrids.

110
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:25,559
Speaker 0: I still have mostly mountain bike and hybrid physical reactions and reflexes.

111
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:33,231
Speaker 1: But yeah, I'll probably you know, go get some bike on Saturday But that I'll probably keep poking around most like it.

112
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:33,633
Speaker 0: at my met.

113
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:35,422
Speaker 0: my current hybrid repaired It's just.

114
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:38,340
Speaker 0: it's accumulated a lot of wear and tear over the last decade.

115
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:49,125
Speaker 0: So in some other news Not to get it into all the great parts for mine all the ridiculous politics right now because it's uh, there's a constitutional crisis Ongoing in the US for the past.

116
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:50,028
Speaker 1: how many years.

117
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:53,097
Speaker 0: it's worse now because now you've got even.

118
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:54,060
Speaker 0: here's the summary.

119
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,345
Speaker 1: It's even worse.

120
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:57,615
Speaker 1: We're still not doing anything and it's even worse.

121
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:58,800
Speaker 1: They're still not doing well.

122
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,620
Speaker 0: The problem is we can't do anything.

123
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:07,080
Speaker 0: We already vote for people or who could do the right thing and we have no other political power.

124
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:13,532
Speaker 0: But the the deal that's going on right now it for those of you who don't live in the u.s And actually those of you who do in the live in the u.s.

125
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:14,740
Speaker 0: Because a lot of people don't know how this works.

126
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:23,460
Speaker 0: there's three branches of the US government and They are co-equal in power and ostensibly they have checks and balances against each other.

127
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,940
Speaker 0: Oh, he says they taught us the school like any two of them can technically like override the third.

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:38,920
Speaker 0: but For various reasons one of those branches is split in two the house in the Senate That's Congress and they have different powers.

129
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:47,037
Speaker 0: And right now the broken evil party controls one of those and the actually good political party The Democrats controls the other one.

130
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:55,000
Speaker 0: So the Democrats control the part the part of our Congress that is allowed to basically investigate things.

131
00:07:55,784 --> 00:08:02,494
Speaker 0: so they started investigating a bunch of things and Our executive branch just said nah, we're just not gonna answer your questions.

132
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,678
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do about it?

133
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:08,312
Speaker 0: fight me and the Constitution Makes this a weird problem.

134
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:09,340
Speaker 0: That's gonna be hard to resolve.

135
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:17,753
Speaker 0: so independent of all that because this isn't geek nights politics As you may know we tend to endorse candidates on geek nights for various things.

136
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:19,860
Speaker 0: rim does well geek nights does officially.

137
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:23,511
Speaker 1: We should endorse candidates for things that aren't political but do involve voting.

138
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:24,715
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

139
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:39,440
Speaker 0: We should endorse like Joey Jojo for head of panels at some convention we go to But in the Democratic Party's primary has begun even though the election is not for a long long time.

140
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,962
Speaker 1: I don't know why they do this shit So early.

141
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:48,049
Speaker 1: they should like have some sort of rule that like you can't do this until you know What exactly would the rule say?

142
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,200
Speaker 0: what if I'm not technically running for president?

143
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:54,575
Speaker 0: I'm just going around like giving speeches about great stuff.

144
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:58,088
Speaker 0: I care about in my own opinions Like what's the line?

145
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:00,862
Speaker 0: That's why it's hard to legislate that I Mean.

146
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:07,554
Speaker 1: there are countries that don't have freedom of speech But heavily regulate political campaigning like Japan where it's like.

147
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:13,880
Speaker 1: really I remember learning I don't know how true this is anymore where it's like you can only send X Flyers out.

148
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,577
Speaker 1: They're like a specific number like they really live like.

149
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:28,422
Speaker 1: specifically They were like you can drive your van around with megaphones on it for this much time during these hours like Everyone was limited to exactly the same amount of campaigning Resources.

150
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:31,091
Speaker 1: like to like really specific details.

151
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,480
Speaker 1: right so we could we could go to that far.

152
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:34,042
Speaker 1: I have no.

153
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:36,494
Speaker 1: actually don't have a bunch of a problem with that as long as you're not.

154
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:40,049
Speaker 1: you know some principled For you know free speech person right.

155
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:48,356
Speaker 1: so yeah, you can say whatever you want, but you may give ten speeches You may have five rallies you may have you may be on TV for ten hours total right.

156
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:49,620
Speaker 0: so what if I don't declare?

157
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,719
Speaker 0: That I'm running yet, and I just have a big party?

158
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:54,862
Speaker 0: Like?

159
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:56,411
Speaker 0: I just throw a giant house party.

160
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:57,879
Speaker 0: I ran out of convention center and have a party.

161
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:00,274
Speaker 1: Well, it's we check you go.

162
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:00,899
Speaker 1: You're a candidate.

163
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,059
Speaker 1: now Let's see how many parties you've had in the past.

164
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,188
Speaker 1: You know well all that.

165
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:08,360
Speaker 1: all the stuff you've done that may contribute is now gonna count.

166
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,553
Speaker 1: You know it's like okay You drove your campaign van around all last year and now you want to run.

167
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:17,740
Speaker 1: oh actually you can't run because you've already gone over The limit and as soon as you go over the limit you're kicked out.

168
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,446
Speaker 1: You're not even the ballot.

169
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:19,394
Speaker 0: the end the other.

170
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:20,120
Speaker 0: the other problem.

171
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:23,740
Speaker 1: If you did the exact limit, and you've used it all up, it's like oh you've already met your quota.

172
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,400
Speaker 1: I can't do it anymore, but you're running so you got to use the other stuff now.

173
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then here's the problem.

174
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,272
Speaker 0: This is this is sort of a fundamental problem in American politics.

175
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:34,964
Speaker 0: someone else who is a fan of you Does not?

176
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:38,320
Speaker 0: they just throw their own parties, and they like you as they give their personal opinion.

177
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,000
Speaker 1: I wonder how Japan gets around that if they still do have these cells from.

178
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:51,191
Speaker 0: Generally the reason this is not as much of a problem everywhere else in the world is a combination of Democracy isn't as direct in those places clearly.

179
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:53,761
Speaker 0: It's on a lower like a smaller scale Mm-hmm.

180
00:10:53,962 --> 00:11:00,264
Speaker 0: there's fewer people involved and fewer people who vote actually give a shit about issues Like.

181
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:07,210
Speaker 0: it's very contentious right now, so our participation rates are rising and And America has a lot of unique problems as well, but I digress.

182
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:14,493
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say is that there are like 4,000 people running for the Democratic nomination for president right now.

183
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:17,863
Speaker 0: too many and a lot of them are pretty good And I'm gonna be blunt.

184
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:20,132
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of awful ones.

185
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,400
Speaker 1: There's just some that are clearly better than others.

186
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:24,129
Speaker 1: It's like well look at all these chocolate bars.

187
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:25,999
Speaker 1: even the Hershey bar still tastes good.

188
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:29,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I'm not gonna buy it, but it I'm not gonna poop it.

189
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,268
Speaker 0: We're basically we're voting on.

190
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,680
Speaker 1: if it was the only one I would totally eat it and go mmm delicious.

191
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:39,140
Speaker 0: We're voting on which candy bar of any kind is gonna run against a literal piece of shit, right?

192
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,900
Speaker 1: So we're trying to find you know the golden you know Swiss chocolate bar.

193
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,159
Speaker 1: That's the one we want, but we'll take pretty much any chocolate we can get because right now We have shit yep.

194
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:56,900
Speaker 0: So in that primary with a lot of people like I will vote in the general election for literally anyone the Democrats nominated.

195
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,751
Speaker 1: I will take the Hershey's chocolate yep.

196
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:05,776
Speaker 0: Yes, but I Would prefer and I think as geek knives tasting dark chocolate 88% cacao.

197
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:16,890
Speaker 0: We're going to endorse Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary because she has actual well-thought-out policies.

198
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:24,235
Speaker 0: that are Scott ideas But with actual numbers and plans behind them and no other candidate has this.

199
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,740
Speaker 1: it's like voting for me only.

200
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:29,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, smarter more serious like Bernie Sanders.

201
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:30,359
Speaker 0: I'd be like bro.

202
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:30,942
Speaker 0: We should.

203
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:35,720
Speaker 0: we should blow up the blah and change the blonde free college for everyone's voting for angry old man Scott.

204
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Elizabeth Warren is more like let's break up Amazon.

205
00:12:39,494 --> 00:12:41,000
Speaker 1: trying to be reasonable Scott.

206
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:46,266
Speaker 0: let's break up Amazon in these way like for these reasons or Let's forgive college debt.

207
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:47,954
Speaker 0: and here are the numbers.

208
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:48,576
Speaker 1: how to do it.

209
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:55,554
Speaker 1: the only politician I've ever heard say you know that was pretty much the moment I decided like all right you are now the tastiest chocolate for now.

210
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:59,851
Speaker 1: Yeah, right because the only politician I've ever heard say let's bust up Amazon with Zephyr.

211
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:04,438
Speaker 1: teach out who in was a New York Someone who ran for governor of New York and did not do that.

212
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:11,158
Speaker 1: well Yeah, but you know was sort of a more out there candidate still even though she's really smart and cool.

213
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:21,880
Speaker 1: Yep, right I like her a lot, but then to have someone running for president with a good chance You know come out with the same kind of position in a more reasonable less far out way.

214
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:27,419
Speaker 1: Just you know like I saw a tweet like Elizabeth Warren just says I want to break up Amazon, and I'm like.

215
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:37,306
Speaker 1: well Yep, I saw the college debt person with Amazon credit card and prime account and bought her buys everything on Amazon You know votes for Canada.

216
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:49,278
Speaker 0: who says let's break up Amazon and says Amazon get out of my neighborhood Yep, so yeah If we would recommend that you also support Elizabeth Warren in the primary with the caveat that we all understand.

217
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:54,666
Speaker 0: now if you're saying I don't care if a Snickers bar three musketeers gets the nomination We're eating it now.

218
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:57,220
Speaker 1: if you might be saying well wait a minute the primary is like when?

219
00:13:57,861 --> 00:13:59,647
Speaker 0: Well forever right.

220
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,891
Speaker 1: and you might be saying well.

221
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:01,935
Speaker 1: Why does this matter now?

222
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:03,480
Speaker 1: this primary is so far out?

223
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:06,431
Speaker 1: I'm gonna vote then if I probably might even get to vote for her.

224
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:11,020
Speaker 0: if she loses like voting is the least important part of The she might drop out in some earlier round.

225
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,292
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I will tell you exactly why this matters right now.

226
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:21,659
Speaker 1: because like we said you know We don't have those restrictive rules of Japan or anything like that right you know you can do right now.

227
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:27,554
Speaker 0: You can give Elizabeth Warren money right now Or you can also talk about her on social media.

228
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:32,113
Speaker 0: like that sounds dumb and silly But that is what gets people to pay attention.

229
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:33,820
Speaker 0: It's weird, but it works anyway.

230
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:43,804
Speaker 1: So if you have money yeah, and you got money to spare or you might be saying well I could just give my money directly to something cool like you know Planned Parenthood Which you could do that too.

231
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:48,160
Speaker 0: You should maybe but all those things will be destroyed if the Democrats don't retake power.

232
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,642
Speaker 0: That's right.

233
00:14:48,683 --> 00:14:50,512
Speaker 1: This is an indirect right.

234
00:14:50,572 --> 00:15:02,780
Speaker 1: so you can give like $20 to Elizabeth Warren and if she somehow wins you effectively then Multiplied your money because that will then redirect trillions of dollars in the US budget.

235
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:04,888
Speaker 1: Yep, and then you won't need to be given $20 to.

236
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:13,478
Speaker 1: you know whatever it is You're gonna give you $20 to yeah some fight cancer fund because the NIH will be funny.

237
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:19,080
Speaker 0: Instead the bajillion dollar also a secondary reason that we're for her.

238
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,540
Speaker 0: I just clicked on her webpage randomly, and she's just holding up a microphone.

239
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:25,014
Speaker 1: I can see her webpage say give me money on it.

240
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:31,072
Speaker 0: of course of course It's American politics, but you vote with your dollars and your social media.

241
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:34,020
Speaker 0: actual voting is like the least important part of our process.

242
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:40,927
Speaker 0: But she's holding what looks like either a sure SM It might be a sure beta 58 a I can't tell.

243
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:49,690
Speaker 1: It's one of those two, okay She knows how to use a microphone.

244
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,479
Speaker 1: yep, that's a big plus.

245
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:53,266
Speaker 0: What do you got in the news?

246
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:54,975
Speaker 1: What do I have in the news?

247
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:55,960
Speaker 1: Let me see what was my new?

248
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:16,622
Speaker 1: So you know we often talk about scenarios where someone is out there making usually a video game and that video game is new and it's usually a remake or a remix of some kind and has a blatant complete disregard for all copyright and trademark law and Property.

249
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:20,354
Speaker 1: intellectual property rights is across the board for example.

250
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:21,900
Speaker 1: It was like a Metroid remakes.

251
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, 3d chrono trigger remake.

252
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:25,109
Speaker 1: right.

253
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:31,919
Speaker 1: things along that line have happened many times and on this show long ago I would maybe rim can find the video again and and link it.

254
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:38,540
Speaker 1: Someone gave the excellent advice which is also my advice that they just made a video expressing the advice better than I did.

255
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:48,416
Speaker 1: Maybe find the geek nights episode where we had it as thing of the day News whatever it was and basically they were saying hey if you're making one of these things Shut your fucking

256
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,122
Speaker 0: mouth Don't tell

257
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:58,355
Speaker 1: anyone you're making it until it is done done done, and then release it and then even if it gets taken down It's okay because everyone has it

258
00:16:58,838 --> 00:16:59,020
Speaker 0: right.

259
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:01,665
Speaker 1: so Here we go.

260
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,972
Speaker 1: somebody made and this isn't a big deal.

261
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,319
Speaker 1: It's not something you're actually maybe gonna want to play.

262
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:07,145
Speaker 1: It's a big deal.

263
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:14,700
Speaker 1: from a like technology stand It's like I want to play the Metroid remake and the chrono trigger remake that got posed.

264
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,451
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't really want to play this so much, but what it is?

265
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:28,959
Speaker 0: they remade Super Mario Brothers 1 For the Commodore 64 and if you're old enough to have YouTube like be from that era that is shocking to hear.

266
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,153
Speaker 1: it is Incredible that they were able to make that hardware play that game.

267
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:39,560
Speaker 1: considering other games for that hardware From when that hardware was popular we're nowhere near as good as any s games.

268
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, so they were able to do this pretty incredible.

269
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:45,787
Speaker 1: Jana sisters for Commodore 64 Which is like all.

270
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:51,232
Speaker 1: even that was getting you know sued by Nintendo Was nowhere near as good as this thing looks like.

271
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:51,533
Speaker 1: you know.

272
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:52,820
Speaker 1: it's like incredible looks.

273
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,588
Speaker 0: It's shocking how smoothly it plays.

274
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:59,540
Speaker 1: yes, so it basically looks like Mario Brothers with slightly met colors.

275
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:01,913
Speaker 1: Yep, right and it plays super smooth.

276
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:03,039
Speaker 1: It looks exactly right.

277
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:05,384
Speaker 1: It plays exactly the same.

278
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:06,287
Speaker 1: the levels are the same.

279
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:11,080
Speaker 1: it's obviously a blatant copyright trademark infringement on Nintendo's property.

280
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:15,940
Speaker 0: It's also the kind of thing that I think needs to be protected by a modern revitalized copyright system.

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,595
Speaker 1: But regardless the people who made this we're very smart, and you know what they did.

282
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:21,980
Speaker 0: they shut the fucking mouths.

283
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,460
Speaker 1: They released version 1.0.

284
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:24,963
Speaker 1: It's out.

285
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:36,140
Speaker 1: you can get it from someone else who got it and then Nintendo came and shut them down And it was like okay, we that was surprising that you even this Commodore 64 thing and in 2019 you're shutting down really, okay?

286
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,124
Speaker 1: But I guess you're Nintendo.

287
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:39,395
Speaker 1: That's what you're gonna do, but guess what everyone has this.

288
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:40,199
Speaker 1: now you can get it.

289
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not you know gone gone.

290
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,147
Speaker 1: It's not stopped before it was finished.

291
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:44,689
Speaker 1: development.

292
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,021
Speaker 1: what I think it was like one dude spent like a shit ton of years working on It.

293
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:49,407
Speaker 1: it's amazing.

294
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,999
Speaker 1: you can go get it if you really want to or at least watch a video of it.

295
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:55,700
Speaker 1: And Nintendo got burned because someone followed the correct advice.

296
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:59,275
Speaker 1: So if you're doing anything like this follow the same advice.

297
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:00,459
Speaker 1: yeah, it works.

298
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,029
Speaker 0: So I don't have any news cuz.

299
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:07,052
Speaker 0: as much as I would like to hurry like yell about politics I'll just yell into my pillow.

300
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:09,385
Speaker 0: tonight It's got Star Trek.

301
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:12,276
Speaker 1: Voyager is a show isn't that a really old one.

302
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:13,340
Speaker 1: It's a really old Star Trek.

303
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:14,704
Speaker 0: it's the one that came after.

304
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:19,019
Speaker 0: basically there was next generation in d-space 9 and then this was the one.

305
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,164
Speaker 1: and The reason.

306
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:22,991
Speaker 1: here's what Scott who doesn't like Star Trek knows.

307
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:36,712
Speaker 1: right all right the old Star Trek the original one Right that was like Captain Kirk Yeah But that was the one where it was like alien babes on alien planets old-school kind of pulp sci-fi Galaxy Express like land on a planet.

308
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:37,536
Speaker 0: There's a crisis.

309
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:39,687
Speaker 0: we deal with it We leave right you know.

310
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:41,435
Speaker 1: and then next generation one.

311
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:49,767
Speaker 1: that one was more When I watched some episodes back when it was on the TV in the old days and that one at least to me felt more Like daytime soap opera.

312
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:53,260
Speaker 1: only everyone happened to be on a spaceship and occasionally they would be aliens.

313
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,043
Speaker 1: But not really.

314
00:19:54,143 --> 00:20:08,055
Speaker 1: I didn't really feel any different watching that than watching like any of the things that would be on after the price Is right hmm right, but it was just you know in space, so I guess that made it more acceptable to watch Even though it's basically the same thing and it had a shit.

315
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:08,760
Speaker 1: too many episodes.

316
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:12,853
Speaker 1: And then the DS 9 one which I watched maybe one episode of ever.

317
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,883
Speaker 0: people have described it as the wire in space The one.

318
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:21,666
Speaker 1: what I know about that is they weren't on a ship they were on a space station Yep at the edge of like Federation.

319
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:21,887
Speaker 0: Well.

320
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:23,692
Speaker 1: I didn't know that part.

321
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:27,287
Speaker 0: It's called deep space 9 because it's in deep space It's way out there.

322
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:28,880
Speaker 1: I just realized that just now.

323
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:33,549
Speaker 0: And the Beatles isn't the bug it's the musical.

324
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:37,060
Speaker 1: I learned that long time ago, but also okay same kind of real thing.

325
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:45,056
Speaker 1: Yes, it had a guy with real big ears on it And I think it was basically you know like a sitcom.

326
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:48,788
Speaker 1: only they were on A space station that didn't move.

327
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,458
Speaker 1: so I guess they didn't have aliens visiting and ships shooting at them.

328
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:56,693
Speaker 1: so in 1995 so this is one I know that there was one called Voyager.

329
00:20:56,753 --> 00:21:01,995
Speaker 1: they came after yep And I know nothing about it other than I assume there was some sort of voyaging going on.

330
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:05,170
Speaker 0: so the shake of Voyager Is that there's this rebellion.

331
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:06,960
Speaker 0: so there's all these settlers?

332
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,660
Speaker 0: Colonizing like illegally colonizing territory that isn't in the humans or this amelian humans.

333
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:17,514
Speaker 0: Okay, and like basically Federation ship bags are colonizing planets.

334
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:19,640
Speaker 0: They are they getting there on in spaceships?

335
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,525
Speaker 1: How do they have spaceships if they're bad?

336
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,792
Speaker 1: well the spaceships all belong to the good.

337
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:26,240
Speaker 0: you know lots of people have spaceships, okay?

338
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,458
Speaker 0: Anyway, they're there.

339
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:37,343
Speaker 0: There's a whole like thing going on and Voyager is a new ship that was developed with new technology And they send it to go deal with them, and it was just like the humans are gonna Go shoot other humans.

340
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:42,700
Speaker 1: basically yeah, okay, so it's like a mad warship unlike that like the Enterprise like an exploring ship.

341
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:45,995
Speaker 1: Right yeah, this is like a warship sort of.

342
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,747
Speaker 0: it's got a little more going on But it's designed for like these special kinds of missions.

343
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:50,750
Speaker 0: It's new technology.

344
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,656
Speaker 1: It has human killing weapons.

345
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:58,352
Speaker 1: Yes, it has weapons And the weapons don't just go pew like this the end.

346
00:21:58,392 --> 00:21:58,713
Speaker 0: It's more.

347
00:21:58,753 --> 00:21:59,475
Speaker 0: It's pretty powerful.

348
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:02,985
Speaker 0: They go to deal with this thing and It's a star destroyer.

349
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:08,183
Speaker 0: They get transported to the opposite side of the universe By accident.

350
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:09,987
Speaker 0: yeah some alien technology happens.

351
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:15,640
Speaker 0: some of the rebels and them get transported like further away than anyone has ever explored.

352
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:20,020
Speaker 0: Okay, the Delta quadrant like way out middle of nowhere.

353
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:24,598
Speaker 0: Because of it because of random because of alien thing that happens uh-huh.

354
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:34,100
Speaker 0: so then Basically the whole thing is them flying back home them and the rebels just all get on the one ship and the goal is how The fuck do we get home even at our maximum?

355
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,670
Speaker 1: So the whole plot of them being rebels and them not being rebels goes away because like well We're all in this together now.

356
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,818
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter that your rebels Yeah, we're fucked now.

357
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:51,800
Speaker 0: But you can settle in the Delta quadrant if you want even at warp 9 like many many times the speed of light It'll take us like a hundred years of direct flying to get home.

358
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:54,294
Speaker 1: Well, I assume they do the hundred years of direct flying.

359
00:22:54,335 --> 00:22:55,220
Speaker 1: it just takes a hundred years.

360
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:59,413
Speaker 0: So their goal is just to not die and get home right.

361
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,560
Speaker 1: so I would just do the direct flying in a hundred years.

362
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,587
Speaker 1: Just try to live a hundred years.

363
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:06,980
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but along the way they try to like can we make our engines better?

364
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,090
Speaker 0: Can we find a thing can we get a message to?

365
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,880
Speaker 1: they try to stop and like at place?

366
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,394
Speaker 0: Yeah, they basically they continue their mission of explore.

367
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,740
Speaker 0: like do the thing of Explorer?

368
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,350
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't explore.

369
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,537
Speaker 1: their mission was kill the rebels.

370
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,709
Speaker 0: well Yeah, but the general mission of Starfleet is to explore Oh, you know to go where no one has gone before and all.

371
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,758
Speaker 1: I thought that was only big a bold enterprise.

372
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:28,976
Speaker 0: this mission That's that's the Federation's mission, okay?

373
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:33,522
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's the show, but it came out in 1995 and ran till 2001.

374
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:34,608
Speaker 0: I didn't know I ran that late.

375
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:38,528
Speaker 0: Well, it has like two hundred and seventy episodes.

376
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:47,258
Speaker 0: all these things have too many fucking episodes, but it was the era for in my life and in the life of many people around our age that it straddled the.

377
00:23:47,278 --> 00:24:13,148
Speaker 0: I Still watch things on TV, and I don't even have cable anymore Which made it interesting because as a kid I remember really liking the beginning of it And then just stopping watching it even though I really liked it because I didn't watch any TV anymore cuz fuck TV Mm-hmm, and I decided to watch it again because I needed a show to watch like on my shitty Kindle fire while I'm like Running on the treadmill in the winter

378
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:14,914
Speaker 1: to read a book instead of why I can't

379
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,540
Speaker 0: read a book while I'm running on a treadmill.

380
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:24,400
Speaker 0: not I Dare you to run on a treadmill and read a physical book at the same time.

381
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:26,959
Speaker 0: You could not yeah, I'd hold a book.

382
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:28,908
Speaker 0: All right, you're wrong.

383
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:29,673
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want.

384
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:35,880
Speaker 0: I want to see video We will video this for geek nights of you running at nine miles an hour on a treadmill.

385
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,373
Speaker 1: I don't know if I can run nine miles an hour.

386
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:40,507
Speaker 0: all right We'll figure out how fast you can run.

387
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:44,299
Speaker 0: and you've got to run at that speed for like 20 minutes while reading a book.

388
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:46,694
Speaker 1: I don't know if I can run in any speed for 20 minutes.

389
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:49,929
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm picking a walk for 20 minutes.

390
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:51,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could read a book while walking.

391
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,040
Speaker 0: Why would I walk on a treadmill?

392
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:54,480
Speaker 1: Cold outside.

393
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,080
Speaker 0: The whole point of being on a treadmill is to exercise.

394
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:00,635
Speaker 0: I'm gonna run it like nine or ten miles an hour on the treadmill.

395
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:01,359
Speaker 1: not a thing I do.

396
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:08,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, so I watched all the Voyager okay, and I guess it must have been good enough for you to keep watching It.

397
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:09,924
Speaker 1: here's the problem is bad.

398
00:25:09,964 --> 00:25:11,229
Speaker 1: I imagine you would have just stopped.

399
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:13,657
Speaker 1: Here's what's fascinating a hundred something episodes.

400
00:25:13,737 --> 00:25:14,098
Speaker 1: Here's what's

401
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,585
Speaker 0: fascinating I I realized re watching this show with

402
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:18,266
Speaker 1: adult brain

403
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:31,770
Speaker 0: and then and also like with adult brain and Continuing to watch the show beyond where I stopped watching I Realized that the show is actually really good and the only reason I stopped watching and remembered it being boring.

404
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:32,800
Speaker 1: You stopped watching TV.

405
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:33,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was commercials.

406
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:41,128
Speaker 0: That's true, too I had because when I watch these episodes every time like I see the moment coming of it's gonna come to commercial break.

407
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:46,504
Speaker 0: fuck this I realized when I was a kid as soon as the first commercial break happened.

408
00:25:46,805 --> 00:26:01,410
Speaker 0: I turned off any TV show Just instantly, so I remembered the first setup of every single Star Trek Voyager episode up until like the year 2000 And I don't remember how it resolved cuz I turned it off or fell asleep as soon as the first commercials came on.

409
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:06,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd only ever watched Ten Commandments on television, and I'd never watched the whole thing in one go.

410
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:07,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, I always what.

411
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,014
Speaker 1: but I've seen all of it Moses Big fan hot

412
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:12,656
Speaker 0: yule Brenner

413
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:32,876
Speaker 1: right, but I watched it again because it was Passover and I downloaded a 1080p HD And I watched it all at once and it is this 1080p I downloaded even included like this introduction at the beginning is basically what you would have seen in the theaters in 1956. it included intermission and the overture Yeah, and it no commercials.

414
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:38,250
Speaker 1: and the fact that there are no commercials made it way easier to watch and understand more impact.

415
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,274
Speaker 1: It's just better in every way.

416
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:46,930
Speaker 0: I Nothing but smoldering pictures of yule Brenner.

417
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:51,329
Speaker 1: There's no such thing that you could just type you'll Brenner because there is not a non smoldering.

418
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,904
Speaker 0: You'll Brenner picture might have been the hottest one of the hottest men to ever live.

419
00:26:54,924 --> 00:26:55,908
Speaker 1: He's up there.

420
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,153
Speaker 0: Yeah He's definitely up there.

421
00:26:57,635 --> 00:27:01,650
Speaker 0: Anyway, my law my geek bite is by the way, you'll Brenner smoke themselves to death.

422
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,438
Speaker 1: We have on cancer.

423
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,368
Speaker 0: don't smoke don't smoke.

424
00:27:04,252 --> 00:27:13,832
Speaker 0: But Star Trek Voyager in a moderate like watching it on Netflix where there are no commercial breaks really good Really tight Tells.

425
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,382
Speaker 1: only they could remove track from other show.

426
00:27:16,422 --> 00:27:21,390
Speaker 0: I know but because it's not a comedy There's no laugh track and as a result, I was good.

427
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:30,713
Speaker 0: I will say that Voyager is actually one of my favorite Star Trek's now that I've watched it in a modern post commercial post television Context.

428
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,710
Speaker 0: and the best characters are the non human characters.

429
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:45,404
Speaker 0: Basically, the doctor who is a hologram and the Borg are the only two actually good characters Yeah, and all the like human or effectively human characters.

430
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,210
Speaker 0: pretty boring and a boring human arcs.

431
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:51,423
Speaker 0: but the non human characters actually have pretty good arcs and pretty interesting stories.

432
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:55,055
Speaker 0: and if you thought that Voyager was boring because you Tried to watch it on TV.

433
00:27:55,076 --> 00:28:02,388
Speaker 0: I would recommend giving it a second go because Commercials ruin everything that is good and ads are a cancer upon entertainment.

434
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:12,038
Speaker 0: and now it's time for the wings of the day.

435
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:27,462
Speaker 0: so Scott say you've got a Cube Okay, that weighs like a kilogram all right, and you got another cube that weighs a kilogram and you got a wall and you'll push what the one one cube.

436
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:34,288
Speaker 0: add another cube and It'll hit that cube and then that cube will hit a wall and bounce back toward the thing.

437
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:38,299
Speaker 0: You just knocked Like you understand this this concepts.

438
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:39,745
Speaker 0: Yeah in a physics world.

439
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:43,423
Speaker 0: They're both one kilogram Yeah, or two kilograms or some number of kilograms.

440
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:47,739
Speaker 1: both the cubes are the same The same same man, let's say they're the same right.

441
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,815
Speaker 1: the first cube hits the second cube Yeah, it stops moving.

442
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:53,523
Speaker 1: The next one carries all the energy.

443
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:54,849
Speaker 1: Yeah goes into the wall.

444
00:28:55,131 --> 00:29:03,290
Speaker 1: Yeah bounces off the wall goes back into the first cube Then the first cube is moving and then eventually runs out energy and you got to push that first cube hard enough.

445
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,130
Speaker 1: Well, it might stop somewhere in between.

446
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,730
Speaker 1: Other than the friction heat and wind air resistance energy that gets lost.

447
00:29:12,232 --> 00:29:15,270
Speaker 1: Right, you know all the energy is going into the movement of the cube.

448
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:18,991
Speaker 1: It would be the same if you just push the one cube against the wall and it bounced off Right.

449
00:29:19,012 --> 00:29:26,610
Speaker 1: So what if let's what does like when you have all the balls on a string and you hit one at the end You let it go and then the one on the other end jumps out and all the rest of them is not moving.

450
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:28,290
Speaker 0: So let's assume there's no friction.

451
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:29,776
Speaker 0: So it is just one to one.

452
00:29:29,796 --> 00:29:33,470
Speaker 0: you hit cube one and it's cube to cube to bounce off the wall comes back.

453
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,488
Speaker 0: How many collisions occur?

454
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:38,878
Speaker 1: Let's see cube one hits cube two.

455
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,324
Speaker 1: Yep one two hits wall.

456
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,770
Speaker 1: Yep cube two hits cube one.

457
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:43,383
Speaker 1: Yep, that's three three three.

458
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:44,169
Speaker 0: All right three.

459
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,486
Speaker 0: What if the first cube weighs more like two kilograms or 16 kilograms or 64 kilograms?

460
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:52,551
Speaker 1: All right.

461
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:54,017
Speaker 1: Well the first cube comes in the.

462
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:56,206
Speaker 1: so the first cube is bigger.

463
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:56,306
Speaker 1: Yeah.

464
00:29:56,768 --> 00:29:58,256
Speaker 1: All right The first cube is bigger.

465
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,281
Speaker 1: So it comes in.

466
00:29:59,322 --> 00:30:00,689
Speaker 1: it hits the hits the second cube.

467
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:05,948
Speaker 1: I guess the bigger first cube would not would keep moving along right.

468
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:06,670
Speaker 1: it would keep going.

469
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,563
Speaker 0: So it's getting closer and closer and closer, right?

470
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:15,285
Speaker 1: So the second cube Cube is gonna fly towards the wall, but the first cube isn't stopped.

471
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:18,938
Speaker 1: It's gonna keep moving along Slower than it was but still moving.

472
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:30,926
Speaker 1: It just put a bunch of its energy into that for a second cube Yep, and then the small one is gonna bounce off the wall come back and hit again Yeah, and then so there's a lot of collisions.

473
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:35,530
Speaker 1: actually probably Yeah, you're probably gonna get like a ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding any situation and they eventually stop.

474
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:40,010
Speaker 0: So what if I told you that if you calculate for this situation?

475
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:48,921
Speaker 0: The number of collisions the bigger the first cube is compared to the second cube it The number of collisions ends up being PI.

476
00:30:49,544 --> 00:30:50,690
Speaker 0: It's the digits of PI.

477
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:54,463
Speaker 0: It is the digits of PI.

478
00:30:54,825 --> 00:31:07,430
Speaker 0: if it's a 1,000,000 kilogram cube and a 1 kilogram cube the number of collisions is 3140. and if you keep increasing this it converges on the digits of PI.

479
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:10,130
Speaker 0: It sounds crazy.

480
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:12,128
Speaker 0: That is the answer.

481
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:16,584
Speaker 1: That's just an artifact of how we do math and not an artifact of the universe.

482
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:18,090
Speaker 0: No, it is an artifact of the universe.

483
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:25,116
Speaker 0: So if it is a 1 oh Kilogram cube against a 1 kilogram cube.

484
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:30,670
Speaker 0: the number of collisions is three three million one hundred forty one thousand five hundred and ninety-two.

485
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,924
Speaker 0: It does in fact calculate PI.

486
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:35,310
Speaker 0: this video is called.

487
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:38,278
Speaker 0: So why do colliding blocks compute PI?

488
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,862
Speaker 0: and in 15 minutes?

489
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:42,650
Speaker 0: The answer is amazing and terrifying.

490
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,389
Speaker 1: What if the mass of my cube?

491
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:46,926
Speaker 1: Was e?

492
00:31:47,936 --> 00:31:49,849
Speaker 1: Would it bounce negative one time?

493
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:58,365
Speaker 1: Then anyway, no the mass I think has to be negative one then it would bounce e times.

494
00:31:58,606 --> 00:31:59,770
Speaker 0: Yeah can't have negative mass.

495
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:04,309
Speaker 1: Or yup, I bounce a black hole into a rims face.

496
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:08,922
Speaker 0: Anyway, this video is you know that numberphile channel.

497
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:11,130
Speaker 0: we link to it kind of often because it's a really fun channel.

498
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,187
Speaker 1: They've been making a little less videos lately, but they did put it out recently.

499
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:14,650
Speaker 1: They're not dead.

500
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:15,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, they make really good stuff.

501
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:21,910
Speaker 0: But numberphile is like here's a cool math concept explained at rim and Scott's like current understanding of math.

502
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:29,310
Speaker 1: Explain it to educated person who can do basic arithmetic and knows like algebra, but who hasn't actually done much serious math since college.

503
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:38,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, so or ever Three blue one round is a channel that basically is numberphile for people who actually continued to study math.

504
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,217
Speaker 1: Oh, so I can't understand anything in this video.

505
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:44,070
Speaker 0: You will it's just you have to give this video your full attention.

506
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:47,240
Speaker 1: But I'll just trust you on the PI thing.

507
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,584
Speaker 0: It's kind of amazing.

508
00:32:48,824 --> 00:32:53,301
Speaker 1: the explanation good fucking God that is an amazing colliding block is amazing.

509
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:59,889
Speaker 0: if true calculates PI and The reason it calculates PI actually does make sense.

510
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:01,994
Speaker 1: What about spheres?

511
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:03,036
Speaker 1: always fears instead?

512
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:07,488
Speaker 0: They do the same thing because they're wouldn't they calculate some square.

513
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:11,321
Speaker 0: Here's the problem Are they the same physical size just with different masses?

514
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:12,324
Speaker 1: Well, no, they're not sliding.

515
00:33:12,344 --> 00:33:13,970
Speaker 1: They're rolling as opposed.

516
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,509
Speaker 0: We already said perfectly elastic no friction, so it wouldn't matter.

517
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:22,930
Speaker 0: But if one's bigger than the other one, it matters a lot because now their center is in a different position.

518
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:26,090
Speaker 0: So the first one might like bounce over the top water.

519
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:27,015
Speaker 1: What if I got us?

520
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:30,170
Speaker 1: I hit a small thing into a big thing, but I hit it fast enough.

521
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,406
Speaker 1: So the big thing moves and the big thing starts out close enough to the wall that it still bounces back.

522
00:33:36,228 --> 00:33:36,489
Speaker 1: I don't know.

523
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:40,027
Speaker 0: Anyway, they calculate PI and it's fucking amazing.

524
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:40,569
Speaker 0: What do you got?

525
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:41,993
Speaker 1: What do I have?

526
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:45,890
Speaker 1: so, you know in the world we have lots of languages and alphabets.

527
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

528
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,718
Speaker 1: and then we have ways of music notation.

529
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,282
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much convert right.

530
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:52,950
Speaker 1: you draw dots on sticks on bars, right?

531
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,298
Speaker 1: You know how music looks like when you're writing sheet music.

532
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've studied music theory in detail.

533
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:58,689
Speaker 1: even I know how to read that.

534
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,221
Speaker 1: You know, there are other ways of writing musical notation.

535
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:05,890
Speaker 1: There's like guitar tabs, which are slightly different, right?

536
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,056
Speaker 1: They're pretty much still dots on bars kind.

537
00:34:08,077 --> 00:34:10,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, but not exactly the same.

538
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:13,032
Speaker 0: I've always considered tabs to be Guitar.

539
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:16,626
Speaker 0: players want to play chords, but don't actually want to learn how to read music.

540
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:17,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically.

541
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:22,090
Speaker 1: But you know there have been other musical notation systems in history.

542
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:30,989
Speaker 1: There still are many in use in some places But pretty much the normal one that you think of with treble clef's and shit is the one in most of the world.

543
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:35,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but a comic combined with Italian language like that's what we use.

544
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:40,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, but here is one that I'd never seen before and this whole article about it.

545
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:45,370
Speaker 1: That is really amazing and not mostly amazing just because it looks fucking awesome.

546
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:47,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it's a work of art.

547
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:52,417
Speaker 1: Like if I look at some sheet music sheet music can occasionally be a work of art But it's generally kind of meh.

548
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:54,263
Speaker 1: It's a better heard than seen.

549
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:55,065
Speaker 0: Yeah of all people.

550
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:56,110
Speaker 0: so you want to know a side story.

551
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:03,536
Speaker 0: I've heard tell that Wagner would write certain notes or certain parts in different colors Just for reasons.

552
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:06,389
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make sure that's actually true and not just something a music teacher told

553
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:17,160
Speaker 1: me I just checked that you'll render did die of lung cancer After he quit smoke like a few years after he quit smoking and then after when he realized the smoke and killed him He was like god damn it and made like anti-smoking ads.

554
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,588
Speaker 1: no like don't die of lung cancer like I didn't.

555
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:20,070
Speaker 1: I'm like.

556
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:26,749
Speaker 1: I'm going to All right anyway, so anyway, so this is a Tibetan way.

557
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:28,356
Speaker 0: That might be a myth.

558
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,450
Speaker 0: the color thing is not on his Wikipedia page anyway.

559
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:37,647
Speaker 1: This is a Tibetan way of a musical notation And it looks fucking awesome and regardless of what it sounds like it is beautiful to behold like.

560
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:40,109
Speaker 1: I kind of want to get one Of these just hanging on the wall or something.

561
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:48,736
Speaker 1: but actually I also learned from this that this is used to denote a type of throat singing that sounds a lot like Mongolian throat singing.

562
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:52,050
Speaker 1: so I guess those places in the world Tibet and Mongolia are pretty close to each other.

563
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:58,966
Speaker 1: So I guess there is some sort of shared Ancestry or shared cultural ancestry related to throat singing.

564
00:35:58,986 --> 00:35:59,630
Speaker 1: that's pretty cool.

565
00:36:00,112 --> 00:36:02,345
Speaker 1: And once you know that this is denoting throat singing.

566
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:07,403
Speaker 1: you sort of make sense When you look at it why it's you know denoting that kind of music.

567
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:09,570
Speaker 0: yep also singing is really awesome.

568
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also like throat singing a lot.

569
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:14,390
Speaker 1: like I just go and Spotify type in some throat singing.

570
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:18,264
Speaker 1: There is a metal band, I think it's called the who band.

571
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,950
Speaker 1: it's a Mongolian throat singing metal band.

572
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,830
Speaker 1: They're fucking awesome, and I think they've been a thing of the day before.

573
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:26,850
Speaker 1: But I was reminded of their existence recently and this is relevant.

574
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,390
Speaker 1: So I figured why not bring up that awesome throat singing metal man so funnily enough?

575
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:31,630
Speaker 0: I got it in high school.

576
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:32,955
Speaker 0: You know I talked about like.

577
00:36:32,995 --> 00:36:38,198
Speaker 0: I got whistling lessons in high school because we wanted to perform a thing like they did a whistling Clinic we have.

578
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,530
Speaker 1: did you see the world whistling championships?

579
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:42,329
Speaker 0: I know of the world whistling championships.

580
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:43,295
Speaker 1: I watched a video.

581
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:46,068
Speaker 1: some people who like went there and made like a mini documentary about it.

582
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,998
Speaker 0: whistling is Difficult to do well, but anyway.

583
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,872
Speaker 0: so we had another clinic for a song We were gonna do.

584
00:36:51,952 --> 00:36:54,702
Speaker 0: that involved throat singing and we had a throat singing expert.

585
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:57,150
Speaker 0: come in awesome and give lessons in throat singing.

586
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,919
Speaker 0: I was unable to do it.

587
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,010
Speaker 1: I feel like that takes a lot more practice to even make any sound.

588
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,637
Speaker 1: So basically for sound.

589
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:11,249
Speaker 0: so we did a clinic with anyone in the class able to make the right thing Like six people who were able to pull it off like at all.

590
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:16,365
Speaker 0: So then they got a much more intensive class to be able to do it for a song we performed.

591
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:17,770
Speaker 0: It was really fun.

592
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:20,703
Speaker 0: I really wish I was able to do it, but I couldn't make it work.

593
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:22,290
Speaker 0: so and we were under pressure.

594
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,837
Speaker 1: So they like all right who can throat sing?

595
00:37:23,857 --> 00:37:24,480
Speaker 0: yep, who?

596
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,630
Speaker 0: who is most likely be able to pull this off rim?

597
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:27,397
Speaker 0: Nope, you can't do it.

598
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:28,688
Speaker 0: stick to your fucking whistling.

599
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:32,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you combine the whistling in the throat singing?

600
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,072
Speaker 0: I can do.

601
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:34,103
Speaker 0: I can your job fitting.

602
00:37:34,225 --> 00:37:42,873
Speaker 0: I can do that I can do the hum and whistle at the same time, but I can't do In the.

603
00:37:43,214 --> 00:37:44,278
Speaker 0: but this stuff's really cool.

604
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:45,020

Speaker 1: Yep, these are the times.

633
00:38:58,275 --> 00:39:07,335
Speaker 0: if you Want us to do more content the best thing you can do to make that happen is to take the videos we upload to YouTube.

634
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:24,810
Speaker 0: so judge anime real harm of games rare game mechanics the three videos we just made and seriously Post them on the reddits and all the places you do your internet shit like the forums and reddits you hang out on that We don't hang out on because we do not go shamelessly self-promote our videos.

635
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:30,436
Speaker 0: We just promote directly from our source, so if you want us to make more things like that Promote them for us.

636
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:33,410
Speaker 1: You know I already tell you not to give rim your patreon money.

637
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:36,710
Speaker 1: Why are you doing free labor for him to promote his content?

638
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,989
Speaker 1: And he should be hiring a PR firm or a marketing firm or something like that.

639
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,720
Speaker 1: Don't give your labor freely to rim.

640
00:39:43,262 --> 00:39:44,468
Speaker 0: I am saying or your money.

641
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:52,200
Speaker 0: I'm just saying if you want us to make more videos the best way to get us to do that I'm not making more videos no matter the view.

642
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,512
Speaker 1: count on the videos will not determine how many more videos I make.

643
00:39:55,652 --> 00:40:01,115
Speaker 0: you're just saying that cuz real harm of games is getting way less views than a rare game mechanics Despite being equally promoted.

644
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:03,724
Speaker 1: I mean I didn't even know what the views were.

00:40:03,744 --> 00:40:05,290
Speaker 1: yeah, I don't look at views.

646
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:12,650
Speaker 1: Yeah My only way that it would ever change than the amount of content I make is if it made you enough money to where you could quit your job, right?

647
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:15,400
Speaker 1: It's not like I check the views or the money.

Speaker 1: someone have to come to me and be like hey Did you know your thing made a bunch of money?

668
00:41:19,971 --> 00:41:21,302
Speaker 1: And it always seemed more like a l5r to me.

669
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:33,350
Speaker 0: Well I guess the way I'd put yeah with the wall and those yeah I can see that like the little I know Or care about Game of Thrones it basically felt like l5r with different skin on it.

670
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:40,482
Speaker 0: I'll put it this way season one is pretty good mostly because There's a hand there's smart care the characters even the good the good ones the evil ones everyone.

671
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:48,969
Speaker 0: They do the smart thing and It's pretty good, and then Wheel of Time also have a wall with bad guys on the other side.

675
00:42:01,932 --> 00:42:09,992
Speaker 0: I remember when Yorkie when you encountered the kaiju wall when we were playing that l5r game The first thing you did was like Time.

676
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,880
Speaker 1: I had ever encountered that trope wasn't a trope.

677
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,370
Speaker 0: then it was fresh, but you got really excited about the wall.

678
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,320
Speaker 1: You're like what's on the other side cuz it was new now.

679

685
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,868
Speaker 0: And then after that it just got kind of boring and I stopped watching.

696
00:42:57,355 --> 00:43:01,178
Speaker 0: There's stuff to watch Adventure times done so you don't have to watch that anymore.

697
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:01,459
Speaker 1: Nope.

698
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:03,287
Speaker 0: All right, let's get into it.

699
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:07,420
Speaker 0: I Am a huge huge fan of horror movies.

700
00:43:07,841 --> 00:43:10,950
Speaker 0: There are not that many good horror movies in the world.

701
00:43:11,813 --> 00:43:16,690
Speaker 1: I am also a fan not huge but a regular sized fan of horror movies.

702
00:43:16,871 --> 00:43:22,450
Speaker 0: I spent my whole life watching horror movies from a very young age because my mom also likes horror movies.

703
00:43:22,731 --> 00:43:25,622
Speaker 0: That's why I want and also my mom also likes the harm.

704
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:30,885
Speaker 0: I like torture porn gore movies Movies slasher movies every kind of horror fiction.

705
00:43:30,905 --> 00:43:31,950
Speaker 0: I am down.

706
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:38,675
Speaker 1: My problem is is that you know, I tend to only it's like I really like Horror movies when they're good.

707
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:41,704
Speaker 1: They are just extremely rarely good now.

708
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:43,750
Speaker 0: also there are very very different subs.

709
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:48,148
Speaker 1: It's like how can it's everyone's like you're a horror movie fan, but like you only like like a handful.

710
00:43:48,188 --> 00:43:53,957
Speaker 1: it's like yeah Well, ninety nine point nine and nine percent of them are really kind of lowbrow crappy cheaply made Blah look like.

711
00:43:54,057 --> 00:43:59,030
Speaker 1: and it's not the fault of the genre It's the fault of the fact that you know, it doesn't make the biggest money.

712
00:43:59,311 --> 00:44:04,738
Speaker 1: So they don't invest the biggest money into making horror films that often Budget lower production value.

713
00:44:04,798 --> 00:44:06,385
Speaker 0: I'd say it's - it's two factors.

714
00:44:06,486 --> 00:44:08,373
Speaker 0: It's the factor of one They don't make.

715
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:12,730
Speaker 0: it's like even a great horror movie just won't make that much money compared to like another movie.

716
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:17,269
Speaker 0: And horror is like comedy and that it's really fucking hard to do.

717
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,702
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, like it is real hard to make a good horror movie.

718
00:44:20,983 --> 00:44:25,481
Speaker 1: It's real hard to make an actually funny movie Yeah, but like my you know, my top ones are like alien.

719
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:27,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, John Carpenter is the thing.

720
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:29,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

721
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:30,679
Speaker 1: those are pretty much the best ones.

722
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:34,070
Speaker 0: but it also look at subgenres like horror is one of those things where?

723
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:38,267
Speaker 0: People who are aficionados like really get granular about the subgenres.

724
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:44,528
Speaker 0: I should watch anyway Or like like slasher matrix and again, oh we were talking about watching The Matrix.

725
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:52,167
Speaker 0: the other day I I watched a Clip from The Matrix because someone did a thing of like how they did this scene that I didn't think about.

726
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:54,443
Speaker 0: guns lots of guns Yeah, no that scene.

727
00:44:54,463 --> 00:44:58,950
Speaker 0: I know what they did it But it was it anyway, I saw trying to hit me and hit me.

728
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,858
Speaker 0: I saw this clip and I was like, oh shit.

729
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:02,003
Speaker 0: I just want to watch The Matrix.

730
00:45:02,224 --> 00:45:02,586
Speaker 0: Of course.

731
00:45:02,807 --> 00:45:07,570
Speaker 0: Oh, no Oh, no, if I should I show you a Star Wars clip, but no I got shit to do tonight.

732
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:13,650
Speaker 0: Scott let's watch just one episode of cowboy bebop and stop as long as it's the last episode.

733
00:45:17,613 --> 00:45:20,330
Speaker 0: Even then I'll watch the end of it and I'll be like who I should watch the beginning.

734
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:21,963
Speaker 1: Let's watch for some of the image.

735
00:45:22,084 --> 00:45:27,566
Speaker 0: Oh, no No, the first episode the the moment where Evangelion grabs me.

736
00:45:27,606 --> 00:45:35,870
Speaker 0: if I watch the very beginning I'm fine until you see that end to palm bomb go off and then you see the nuke like explosion.

737
00:45:36,171 --> 00:45:39,910
Speaker 1: I'm fine until the shot where the car is driving towards the city and the building start coming up.

738
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:41,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty good too for me.

739
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:47,890
Speaker 0: It's the moment where the bomb goes off and then the the old men are like we did it we fucking nuked it.

740
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:48,954
Speaker 1: I know needed to shit.

741
00:45:48,994 --> 00:45:50,922
Speaker 0: Yep, and then you just see the alien.

742
00:45:50,942 --> 00:45:51,785
Speaker 1: They're still walking.

743
00:45:51,946 --> 00:45:52,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just still walking.

744
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,535
Speaker 1: Anyway, let's get on topic.

745
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:59,790
Speaker 0: but like slasher movies the first slasher movies were good at what they did.

746
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,217
Speaker 0: And then there are a million clones.

747
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:07,430
Speaker 0: a lot of times when a horror movie is good There will be a million knockoffs of that particular sub-genre of horror.

748
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,772
Speaker 0: They're all.

749
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:13,570
Speaker 1: and even though a lot of those movies were good in their day For me at least a lot of them have not aged well, right?

750
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:17,689
Speaker 0: Like I can recognize the Evil Dead is a is a product of its time.

751
00:46:18,094 --> 00:46:22,049
Speaker 1: I can recognize You know the quality the the legacy all the.

752
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:26,885
Speaker 1: you know The parts of say a Friday the 13th or a nightmare on Elm Street or a Halloween,

753
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:28,450
Speaker 0: but I play one

754
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:35,528
Speaker 1: Right, but any of those while I can recognize and and respect them like to watch them now for me is kind of a

755
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:36,713
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah,

756
00:46:36,935 --> 00:46:38,002
Speaker 1: but I was right.

757
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:39,070
Speaker 1: It's not like watching alien.

758
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:46,707
Speaker 0: I watched them mostly the way I watch old movies that don't hold up where I'm watching them like as an exploration of that era of cinema.

759
00:46:47,673 --> 00:46:57,130
Speaker 0: But yeah us is a good modern horror movie That is hard to put in a genre of or a sub-genre of horror.

760
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,916
Speaker 1: Well, we got to talk about get out first.

761
00:46:59,097 --> 00:46:59,398
Speaker 1: Okay.

762
00:46:59,499 --> 00:46:59,820
Speaker 0: Okay.

763
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,630
Speaker 1: So yeah, so is Jordan Peele, right?

764
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:05,050
Speaker 1: Yeah of key and peel the great comedy duo.

765
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:09,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you do not realize Jordan Peele is responsible for both get out and us, right?

766
00:47:09,831 --> 00:47:10,631
Speaker 1: So, you know It's like.

767
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:17,450
Speaker 1: I remember key and peel when they were comedy dudes doing funny comedies that I like and are hilarious human beings.

768
00:47:17,651 --> 00:47:19,055
Speaker 1: But I guess they stopped doing that show.

769
00:47:19,477 --> 00:47:23,590
Speaker 1: and now Jordan Peele's producing slash directing horror movies.

770
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:26,119
Speaker 0: Total aside you ever watch Fargo the TV show?

771
00:47:26,822 --> 00:47:27,785
Speaker 1: I watched Fargo the movie.

772
00:47:27,986 --> 00:47:33,522
Speaker 0: Yeah Fargo the TV show There's three seasons is a plus like a plus television.

773
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:35,507
Speaker 1: It's just like retelling the movie or what?

774
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:36,370
Speaker 1: No, what is it?

775
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,414
Speaker 0: Well, let's say lady to the movie in any way Yes, well, we should.

776
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:40,775
Speaker 0: we'll talk.

777
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:41,899
Speaker 0: we should talk about this separately.

778
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,124
Speaker 0: We'll go on for a while.

779
00:47:43,164 --> 00:47:48,600
Speaker 0: They're real good movies good, but They are in one of them as FBI agents.

780
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:51,347
Speaker 0: Oh, that's funny and they're a plus.

781
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,377
Speaker 0: I can imagine Independent of the show being a plus.

782
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:57,570
Speaker 1: so he made the movie get out which was much lauded.

783
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:08,329
Speaker 0: We went to see in the theater and it was a combination of horror and social commentary Which I shouldn't need to say because all good horror movies are some form of social commentary, of course.

784
00:48:10,071 --> 00:48:12,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was actually get out was way good.

785
00:48:12,178 --> 00:48:13,622
Speaker 0: get out is scary as shit.

786
00:48:14,164 --> 00:48:14,986
Speaker 1: It's not scary.

787
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:15,748
Speaker 0: It's a horror movie.

788
00:48:15,788 --> 00:48:17,454
Speaker 0: It's scary It's suspenseful.

789
00:48:17,555 --> 00:48:18,237
Speaker 0: It's got it's got.

790
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:19,803
Speaker 0: it's got suspense scenes.

791
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,530
Speaker 0: It's got good jump-scare scenes.

792
00:48:21,851 --> 00:48:23,678
Speaker 0: It's got good like existential scene.

793
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:26,730
Speaker 0: It's got all the trappings of a horror movie.

794
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:29,685
Speaker 1: I mean it is a horror movie doesn't trappings of it is.

795
00:48:29,745 --> 00:48:32,761
Speaker 0: well you have this weird thing If you say that no movie is scary, it isn't scary.

796
00:48:32,922 --> 00:48:33,727
Speaker 0: All right, what?

797
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:34,350
Speaker 0: what's a movie?

798
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,774
Speaker 0: You've ever seen that was scary?

799
00:48:38,122 --> 00:48:41,882
Speaker 1: because your definition of scary is ridiculous and I digress I mean when I was a kid, I was scared of mr.

800
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:45,199
Speaker 1: Boogity, which isn't even a I'm not anymore.

801
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:50,066
Speaker 0: If we ever make a Small if we ever make a geek nights movie club to go alongside the book club.

802
00:48:50,106 --> 00:48:50,287
Speaker 0: Mr.

803
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,896
Speaker 0: Boogity is good I'm sure it's just on YouTube.

804
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,004
Speaker 1: Anyway, he's googling.

805
00:48:56,425 --> 00:49:00,393
Speaker 1: All right, so The mr.

806
00:49:00,413 --> 00:49:02,921
Speaker 0: Boogity whole movie there you go on YouTube.

807
00:49:03,061 --> 00:49:06,070
Speaker 1: Okay, anyway commercials no.

808
00:49:08,151 --> 00:49:09,998
Speaker 1: Anyway, so get out was real good.

809
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:11,685
Speaker 1: and because get out was so good.

810
00:49:11,725 --> 00:49:13,030
Speaker 1: I'm like, well that was so good.

811
00:49:13,392 --> 00:49:14,396
Speaker 1: I will go see us.

812
00:49:14,437 --> 00:49:22,870
Speaker 1: your new horror movie, you know, not it's not a sequel It's not related to get out directly other than another movie in the same genre made by the same people in the theater again.

813
00:49:23,332 --> 00:49:28,000
Speaker 1: Yes, I will go see that just like you write a good book and you may write another book I'll read that one too, right same deal.

814
00:49:28,483 --> 00:49:32,050
Speaker 1: So he went to see us and Us is also real good.

815
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:38,360
Speaker 1: I don't think it's as good as get out, but it's still real good and I will still go to Yet another horror movie if they make another one.

816
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,132
Speaker 0: I mean, I think the main difference around gonna spoil anything It's a movie.

817
00:49:41,153 --> 00:49:43,845
Speaker 0: just go watch it and it's a horror movie where there are twists.

818
00:49:43,866 --> 00:49:44,790
Speaker 0: You'll probably see him coming.

819
00:49:44,871 --> 00:49:46,360
Speaker 0: Maybe you don't saw him coming.

820
00:49:46,602 --> 00:50:00,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, though I actually expected a deeper twist of like one of the two people Changing as opposed to have anyway, I there was another way that could have gone.

821
00:50:00,106 --> 00:50:01,350
Speaker 0: that would have been a very similar twist.

822
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:12,081
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, and I I thought it was going more in that direction But it was obvious at a certain point with a certain thing Where we both said this is getting dumb.

823
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:12,703
Speaker 0: Oh, wait.

824
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:13,606
Speaker 0: No now it's good again.

825
00:50:13,888 --> 00:50:14,128
Speaker 1: Yep.

826
00:50:14,249 --> 00:50:17,837
Speaker 0: Yep so the theater read.

827
00:50:17,877 --> 00:50:25,005
Speaker 0: the good points about this movie are that number one the Score and soundtrack are just perfect.

828
00:50:25,488 --> 00:50:27,552
Speaker 0: Hmm They they use where.

829
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:31,237
Speaker 1: so I remember during like while watching it.

830
00:50:31,457 --> 00:50:35,610
Speaker 1: right not not the score the the orchestral music.

831
00:50:35,755 --> 00:50:42,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, right But the you know the tracks that they you know of popular music that they selected and inserted into the movie.

832
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:47,292
Speaker 1: We're always the most appropriate song possible Yep But they weren't.

833
00:50:47,312 --> 00:50:54,032
Speaker 0: they served a good purpose in the sense that the movie is both a horror movie with various kinds of scariness And such.

834
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:57,564
Speaker 0: but it is also funny and it does.

835
00:50:57,604 --> 00:50:57,724
Speaker 0: it's.

836
00:50:57,844 --> 00:51:08,662
Speaker 0: it's the kind of horror movie that has some dark humor and some just straight-up humor all interwoven and It's sort of a. it has a complex palette of emotions while you're watching

837
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:23,654
Speaker 1: right and most of it was that the music they selected Was not only super appropriate and super great music But also it wasn't what happens in a lot of movies where they selected like the brand new hit song For promotional

838
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:23,954
Speaker 0: purposes.

839
00:51:23,974 --> 00:51:25,479
Speaker 0: No, no, no, fuck the police.

840
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:29,650
Speaker 1: They were selecting the song for you know, for the movie purposes.

841
00:51:29,831 --> 00:51:44,681
Speaker 0: There's it like there's a moment that there is a serious Horrifying scene happening and a character basically does the equivalent saying Alexa call the police and Alexa's like playing Fuck the police by NWA And then fuck the police just starts playing right.

842
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,890
Speaker 1: and that brings me to my second point about this movie.

843
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:55,141
Speaker 1: Is that perhaps better than any movie I have ever seen ever horror movie at least Where characters are in a difficult situation?

844
00:51:55,161 --> 00:52:00,961
Speaker 1: and it takes place in the present day Like everyone's got cell phones.

845
00:52:01,002 --> 00:52:04,317
Speaker 1: There's Alexa right there There's cars this boats this.

846
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:07,670
Speaker 1: every conceivable modern technology is available.

847
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:09,720
Speaker 0: They're in like a beach town with a lot of people.

848
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,910
Speaker 0: they're not even that isolated not isolated at all.

849
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:12,492
Speaker 1: They're not right.

850
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:21,220
Speaker 1: and yet despite all that the horror scenario and the thing the course of events are Such that a no one does anything stupid.

851
00:52:21,522 --> 00:52:30,270
Speaker 1: and B. They don't need any contrivances whatsoever To say oh, why don't they just solve this problem by using their modern technology?

852
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:37,154
Speaker 1: Because the problem is such that they do try to solve it using their body technology in the same reasonable ways Anyone else would.

853
00:52:37,535 --> 00:52:40,223
Speaker 0: and it doesn't matter character encounters something creepy.

854
00:52:40,544 --> 00:52:42,590
Speaker 0: They are reasonable adults and they're like, yeah, that's crazy.

855
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,444
Speaker 1: No, there's no scene where it's like, oh man, no cell service.

856
00:52:46,544 --> 00:52:48,030
Speaker 1: I guess I can't call the police.

857
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:51,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no scene where it's like, you know, why didn't they just call it?

858
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,420
Speaker 1: They literally just like call the police.

859
00:52:53,621 --> 00:52:55,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they called them that moment.

860
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:57,357
Speaker 0: And again, we're not gonna spoil anything but the dead.

861
00:52:57,598 --> 00:53:01,550
Speaker 0: the kids like why is there a family standing outside our house, right?

862
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,897
Speaker 0: Dad's like there ain't no family standing.

863
00:53:03,977 --> 00:53:05,361
Speaker 1: Oh, there's no nonsense.

864
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:08,129
Speaker 1: for like one character sees something that no one else see.

865
00:53:08,872 --> 00:53:10,802
Speaker 0: Everyone tells everyone everything they could.

866
00:53:10,822 --> 00:53:12,088
Speaker 0: the dad's like there's no families.

867
00:53:12,108 --> 00:53:12,570
Speaker 0: That's stupid.

868
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:13,557
Speaker 0: Then he looks out the windows ago.

869
00:53:13,879 --> 00:53:15,390
Speaker 1: Everyone sees everything.

870
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:18,985
Speaker 0: Everything is real family standing outside and he doesn't like.

871
00:53:19,306 --> 00:53:20,110
Speaker 0: obviously that's creepy.

872
00:53:20,392 --> 00:53:26,997
Speaker 0: But if I everyone's working everyone's working together He goes He goes outside and he's like.

873
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:32,210
Speaker 0: I will go deal with this because even though it's creepy The world is not filled with ghosts and monsters.

874
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:38,066
Speaker 1: Right that we think might be a ghost or a monster who knows what?

875
00:53:38,106 --> 00:53:38,929
Speaker 1: because the horror movie.

876
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:42,921
Speaker 1: and we hear Reasonable people in the real world these characters in this movie.

877
00:53:43,122 --> 00:53:45,150
Speaker 1: They just go take a baseball bat and try to hit it.

878
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, well first he goes outside like okay.

879
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,724
Speaker 1: No tries to talk to it.

880
00:53:48,985 --> 00:53:50,290
Speaker 1: Then he tries to hit it with a baseball.

881
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:52,364
Speaker 0: Yeah, right everything for guys.

882
00:53:52,384 --> 00:53:53,310
Speaker 0: They come back and call the police.

883
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:53,993
Speaker 0: They do everything.

884
00:53:54,054 --> 00:53:57,149
Speaker 0: everybody does everything reasonable at every point in this movie.

885
00:53:57,531 --> 00:54:03,010
Speaker 1: And I think that is like the number one thing that this movie does better than any horror movie ever.

886
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:18,299
Speaker 0: The number two thing that it does is it really sets up a mood and a place Like the atmosphere is set correctly and all the Chekhov's guns are lined up in a row But it escalates faster.

887
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,730
Speaker 0: a lot of horror movies fail because they ramp up really slowly.

888
00:54:22,131 --> 00:54:28,054
Speaker 0: This movie hits a point pretty early on where it goes from like one mile an hour to 100 miles an hour.

889
00:54:28,094 --> 00:54:28,918
Speaker 0: pop up go go go.

890
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:31,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it never slows down after that point.

891
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:32,298
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot It's true.

892
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:33,250
Speaker 1: I didn't even think about that.

893
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:40,407
Speaker 1: Is that you know, there's a lot of ones out there where it's like, okay Even the thing like the or you know alien like the two that I mentioned is being the best right?

894
00:54:40,488 --> 00:54:47,014
Speaker 1: It's like We're gonna be all crying and even after the thing bursts out of the chest and it's quiet This one's like.

895
00:54:47,074 --> 00:54:55,181
Speaker 1: no this does not follow the dread tower model of build suspense Collapse build suspense collapse when people die, right?

896
00:54:55,382 --> 00:54:57,650
Speaker 1: This is what's going on here.

897
00:54:57,851 --> 00:55:04,464
Speaker 1: They're clearly setting up spooky stuff right from the beginning you know and then the spooky stuff unleashes and it's crazy for the rest of the movie.

898
00:55:04,484 --> 00:55:10,428
Speaker 0: crazy crazy in your face and When characters get a rest constant chasing running fighting monsters.

899
00:55:10,509 --> 00:55:12,936
Speaker 0: Oh my god The tension still does ratchet down.

900
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:27,190
Speaker 0: but unlike traditional like slasher movies where situation doesn't unfuck up Nope It's more like torchbearer Where you're still in the dungeon and you're just like getting an hour's respite before you continue to try to carry the tapestry out.

901
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:39,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, like no one's fresh again at any point in this movie who listen to this understands that reference Tapestry carrying and It gets without spoiling anything at all.

902
00:55:40,095 --> 00:55:48,590
Speaker 0: it gets the appropriate amount of surreal and Weird at the end without going overboard and not making sense.

903
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:55,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, the explanation of about what's really going on is similarly surreal to the explanation of what's really going on and get out.

904
00:55:55,250 --> 00:56:05,070
Speaker 0: Yep, it also goes in on the social commentary, but it's a lot less than get out It's more like you can read like you can interpret a lot of very heavy.

905
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:07,101
Speaker 1: It's like what are you?

906
00:56:07,122 --> 00:56:07,990
Speaker 1: it's like we're American.

907
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:08,391
Speaker 0: That's.

908
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:16,642
Speaker 0: that scene is actually one of my favorite moments because it's such a weird answer that even the theater I like I wanted to laugh but it almost wasn't fun.

909
00:56:16,662 --> 00:56:23,562
Speaker 1: And then it makes sense when you In the scene it's like what.

910
00:56:23,864 --> 00:56:27,660
Speaker 1: and but it's like in the scene It seems like a social commentary but also like a what what.

911
00:56:28,002 --> 00:56:36,663
Speaker 1: but then when you zoom out and see the whole movie It's like oh Yeah, they are Americans, yeah, they are Americans but also they're Americans.

912
00:56:36,804 --> 00:56:38,750
Speaker 0: yes, there's there are Americans.

913
00:56:38,871 --> 00:56:40,985
Speaker 1: Yep, that's what the movies trying to say, by the way.

914
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:46,192
Speaker 0: Yeah But The shit.

915
00:56:46,232 --> 00:57:03,527
Speaker 0: the other great part about this movie is that it lines up all the check kinds of Chekhov's guns that happen in horror movies and they do all fire but the results of them firing are Widely varied And I'm not even gonna hint at what I'm referring to.

916
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:04,973
Speaker 0: to see the movie It's really good.

917
00:57:05,394 --> 00:57:08,224
Speaker 1: Like I I even though I did see this in the theater.

918
00:57:08,304 --> 00:57:10,050
Speaker 1: You are okay not see.

919
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,622
Speaker 1: This is not a must see in theater.

920
00:57:11,642 --> 00:57:13,981
Speaker 1: It's okay to see in theater Yeah, but it's not a must.

921
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:14,244
Speaker 0: see it.

922
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:18,281
Speaker 1: the best part Thanks or a DVD or waste your money on Voorhe.

923
00:57:18,421 --> 00:57:20,550
Speaker 0: We saw it with our friend Judith who's on the podcast a while ago.

924
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:30,187
Speaker 0: Just me Scott and Judith because uh other friends of ours didn't want to see it until we had seen it to tell them Cowards, yeah, but also because you know, they might have some specifically triggering things in it.

925
00:57:30,227 --> 00:57:31,030
Speaker 1: That's also a reason.

926
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:38,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, Fred, if you're not okay with the Foley of someone getting stabbed like do not see this movie.

927
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:43,010
Speaker 1: If you're not okay with like, you know people getting beat up with golf clubs or run over by cars.

928
00:57:44,313 --> 00:57:47,809
Speaker 1: You know, it's a horrifying horror movie with horror stuff in it.

929
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:52,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, considering that I've seen like, you know, each of the killer and Ebola syndrome.

930
00:57:52,405 --> 00:57:53,308
Speaker 1: I can watch anything.

931
00:57:53,489 --> 00:57:55,758
Speaker 1: Yeah There's an ad.

932
00:57:55,819 --> 00:58:01,770
Speaker 1: in fact, I would say, you know If you can deal with the alien coming out of the guy's stomach an alien then you can watch this whole movie.

933
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:02,956
Speaker 1: There's nothing as bad as that.

934
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:05,710
Speaker 0: but this one the three of us went to see in the theater like pretty recently.

935
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:08,890
Speaker 0: That's why we're only reviewing it now like near the end of its run.

936
00:58:09,172 --> 00:58:11,449
Speaker 0: So there was like almost no one else in the theater with us.

937
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:20,637
Speaker 0: Yeah there was a family like kind of behind us like to the right and there's a moment in the movie where something creepy happens to the Dad and the dad in

938
00:58:20,657 --> 00:58:21,902
Speaker 1: the family just said

939
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:27,730
Speaker 0: he basically just says oh hell no And we and everyone in the theater just started laughing.

940
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:32,630
Speaker 0: It was real like you'll get that interaction if you see this in a movie theater.

941
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:37,148
Speaker 1: It does have some comedy and it does, you know as a good horror movie shit.

942
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:49,330
Speaker 0: Yes Good horror movies will jump-scare you also separately make you feel existential growing dread and Tension that does not get released until way after you wanted it to and will also make you laugh out loud.

943
00:58:49,933 --> 00:58:52,705
Speaker 0: That is like the mark of a truly great horror movie.

944
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:59,423
Speaker 0: I Will watch this movie again someday Right now but I could watch it again.

945
00:58:59,443 --> 00:59:00,610
Speaker 0: I feel like I'd notice things.

946
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:03,950
Speaker 1: I know it's not like a matrix situation where it's like if I turn it on you're stuck.

947
00:59:04,371 --> 00:59:09,070
Speaker 0: But if you were a fan of scare spooky scary horror movies, this is a top tier.

948
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,870
Speaker 1: What other horror movie you get in besides this recently?

949
00:59:11,991 --> 00:59:16,110
Speaker 0: Like I'm already reaching way back when I'm thinking about a whole like proper horror movies.

950
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:20,888
Speaker 0: I in fact, most of the good horror I get is on pseudopod, which is written fiction.

951
00:59:20,908 --> 00:59:21,450
Speaker 1: Are you still listening?

952
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:22,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, pseudopod is great.

953
00:59:23,556 --> 00:59:27,008
Speaker 0: Like pseudopod if you like horror just subscribe to the pseudopod podcast.

954
00:59:27,028 --> 00:59:27,530
Speaker 0: never look back.

955
00:59:27,873 --> 00:59:29,612
Speaker 1: I mean, you know when people talk, you know And people.

956
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:34,150
Speaker 1: the only recent horror movies I hear about are ones like the one where everyone had to be quiet.

957
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:35,054
Speaker 1: I didn't see.

958
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:35,737
Speaker 1: I saw the trailer.

959
00:59:35,757 --> 00:59:38,850
Speaker 1: I did actually watch the movie and I heard bad things about it.

960
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:41,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then there's the one that's not even new anymore.

961
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:44,301
Speaker 1: It's actually kind of old by now, but it's newer than alien.

962
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:46,470
Speaker 1: Yeah is what's that cabin in the woods one?

963
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:49,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, and everyone loved that but I thought it was hella overrated in May.

964
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:50,962
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was okay.

965
00:59:51,103 --> 00:59:52,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did not a fan.

966
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:55,499
Speaker 0: Ah What's my favorite horror movie?

967
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,448
Speaker 0: I'm trying to think like what's my top like two or three.

968
00:59:58,211 --> 00:59:59,578
Speaker 0: The problem is I like horror comedies.

969
00:59:59,618 --> 01:00:01,890
Speaker 1: You just also big alien and thing and be smart like me.

970
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably I gotta think on it.

971
01:00:04,384 --> 01:00:05,250
Speaker 0: I gotta think on it.

972
01:00:06,331 --> 01:00:06,993
Speaker 0: Us is up there.

973
01:00:07,113 --> 01:00:08,979
Speaker 0: us is very expertly crafted.

974
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:11,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not top ten, but it is good.

975
01:00:11,366 --> 01:00:16,442
Speaker 0: It's not it's top 50 Of course top 50 of all time horribly easily.

976
01:00:16,903 --> 01:00:19,170
Speaker 0: probably top 25 all time probably but I'm hedging here.

977
01:00:19,351 --> 01:00:22,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could have only only named 100 horror movies.

978
01:00:22,423 --> 01:00:24,030
Speaker 1: I mean the problem is, you know some you got it.

979
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,136
Speaker 1: There's too much discussion.

980
01:00:25,156 --> 01:00:32,120
Speaker 1: We're not gonna have it now, but it's like, you know say You know old Dracula like nose for that count.

981
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:33,424
Speaker 1: Is that a horror movie even?

982
01:00:33,745 --> 01:00:36,274
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably not Horror-efficient.

983
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:37,599
Speaker 1: oughta go see Dracula.

984
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:38,644
Speaker 1: Is that a horror movie?

985
01:00:38,864 --> 01:00:40,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, what about hocus-pocus?

986
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,450
Speaker 1: Young Frankenstein, is that a horror movie?

987
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,691
Speaker 1: Is it?

988
01:00:44,052 --> 01:00:44,574
Speaker 1: does it count?

989
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:49,550
Speaker 0: No, that just definitely not count even though it has the proper noun tropes of horror.

990
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,895
Speaker 0: That's its own subjoint.

991
01:00:50,915 --> 01:00:54,590
Speaker 1: So that's I'm saying that same sub-genre as the Munsters, right?

992
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:57,582
Speaker 1: There's some kind of discussions you gotta have there before we can start making this list.

993
01:00:57,742 --> 01:01:04,363
Speaker 0: Yeah, but go see right now I want to make the menu Not the list just like when else is on Netflix or whatever like.

994
01:01:04,423 --> 01:01:06,090
