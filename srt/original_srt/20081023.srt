1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,988
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, October 23rd.

2
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:12,711
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:13,393
Speaker 1: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:14,658
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:15,300
Speaker 0: It's a Thursday.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,301
Speaker 0: We talk about the dorms at RIT.

7
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:26,890
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:45,500
Speaker 0: So you'd think, in these troubled economic times, working for one of those Wall Street financial companies, everyone would be fully vested in interest in what is going on in the stock market and dealing with the systems and the market and all this stuff.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,532
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it depends what your company does.

10
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:48,780
Speaker 1: I mean, like, look, if you're a company...

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,530
Speaker 0: Well, no, I'm about to tell an anecdote.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,100
Speaker 0: You see, I'm not making a general statement.

13
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:58,612
Speaker 0: But you'd think that when there's work to be done, you'd be paying attention to the work, and maybe it's kind of like when you're at a boxing match, right?

14
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:10,527
Speaker 0: More often than not, no matter how much money you paid, I'll bet that if you're watching this boxing match and suddenly two drunk guys in the audience get into a fight, everyone's going to turn and watch the drunk guys.

15
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:13,121
Speaker 1: I was at a football game last weekend and there were.

16
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:18,400
Speaker 1: whenever there's a fight in the stands somewhere, the heads turn that way.

17
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:20,787
Speaker 0: That really says something.

18
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:24,005
Speaker 1: The thing is, usually the fights happen like between plays.

19
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:24,508
Speaker 1: You don't miss.

20
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:27,444
Speaker 1: I didn't miss a single moment of the game despite seeing like two fights.

21
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:32,209
Speaker 0: Well, because the people fighting obviously paid to see the football, obviously.

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,459
Speaker 0: But when there's not football on, they got to do something.

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,932
Speaker 0: But so, you know, we're at work and I'm typing.

24
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:38,997
Speaker 0: It's kind of early in the morning.

25
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:39,862
Speaker 0: Not everyone's in yet.

26
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:43,946
Speaker 0: I'm doing stuff and other people are doing stuff and we're talking about, oh, what's the market going to do?

27
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:44,611
Speaker 0: What's going on?

28
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:45,478
Speaker 0: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

29
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,708
Speaker 0: Talking shop and a mouse walks by.

30
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:55,037
Speaker 0: Little mouse just kind of walks by, walks along kind of casually, walks into a conference room and then we lose sight of him.

31
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:57,369
Speaker 1: So it's a pretty old building.

32
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:59,380
Speaker 0: Well, it's the Lincoln building.

33
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:02,232
Speaker 1: So is this from the 1800s, this building?

34
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:03,700
Speaker 0: No, I don't actually know the full history.

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,372
Speaker 0: All I know is that the Lincoln building is pretty damn old.

36
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:08,804
Speaker 0: It's one of the older skyscrapers in midtown.

37
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,092
Speaker 0: It's like right across from Grand Central.

38
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:10,533
Speaker 1: I guess it's.

39
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:12,483
Speaker 1: it's not older than the Flatiron.

40
00:02:12,543 --> 00:02:13,527
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

41
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:17,439
Speaker 0: But this mouse, it's like, you know, everyone's working.

42
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,387
Speaker 0: And then someone says, was that a mouse?

43
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,117
Speaker 0: Everyone in the entire office.

44
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:23,362
Speaker 0: Remember, our office is all cool.

45
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:26,836
Speaker 0: Like it's one big open space with glass walls and it's kind of neat.

46
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:28,402
Speaker 0: Everyone stands up.

47
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:31,412
Speaker 0: The mouse is now the most important thing in the world.

48
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:34,141
Speaker 0: We ended up chasing it around.

49
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:39,723
Speaker 0: We caught it in a wastebasket and we took it downstairs and we let it outside into the subway.

50
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:39,823
Speaker 0: Yeah.

51
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:41,852
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, think about it, right?

52
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:42,976
Speaker 1: You're at work.

53
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:45,425
Speaker 1: No one actually wants to work, you know.

54
00:02:45,505 --> 00:02:51,265
Speaker 1: And yeah, this excuse is totally thing that happens outside of, you know, the normal workflow.

55
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:58,156
Speaker 1: So everyone's just looking to find any reason to escape and spend some time on something that doesn't happen at work every day.

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,825
Speaker 0: Well, it's a phenomenon I've seen often.

57
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:05,071
Speaker 0: I remember when I worked back at the hospital one day, this was back in the last month there where I didn't really have any work to do.

58
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:08,549
Speaker 0: I got up and I went to go to lunch and I tried to get out.

59
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,318
Speaker 0: And one of the door just like wouldn't open.

60
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,324
Speaker 0: I just couldn't open it.

61
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:14,400
Speaker 0: So I went around to the other side and I saw that the door was jammed.

62
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:20,468
Speaker 0: So I went and told someone and like everyone in the car, there were like a hundred people talking about the door.

63
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:22,981
Speaker 0: Everyone was like standing around like, well, how could we fix it?

64
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,809
Speaker 0: I'm going to try to jam a screwdriver in there.

65
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:25,653
Speaker 0: Oh, that didn't work.

66
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:32,064
Speaker 0: And more people were more interested in this door than anything they'd ever been in anything they'd ever done for this company.

67
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:36,200
Speaker 1: It's a way to escape from, you know, work and do at least something.

68
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:42,183
Speaker 0: Of course, the hospital was different from my current job in that I don't think anyone did any work.

69
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:43,989
Speaker 1: That's most works.

70
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:45,574
Speaker 0: That I don't know.

71
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:46,236
Speaker 0: That's all I have.

72
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:49,226
Speaker 0: It was it was kind of a boring day other than the mouse.

73
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,232
Speaker 1: Yeah, my day.

74
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:52,415
Speaker 1: Not too exciting.

75
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:57,578
Speaker 1: Starting to, you know, it's getting a little corporate up in my business now that we got bought.

76
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,063
Speaker 1: You know, they quit.

77
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:01,109
Speaker 1: I got to get another job first.

78
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:01,570
Speaker 1: And I've.

79
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,014
Speaker 0: I've never been quit shy.

80
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,723
Speaker 1: I'm not quit shy.

81
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:07,751
Speaker 1: I'm very quit trigger happy.

82
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:10,803
Speaker 1: The only thing is I don't quit until I got a place to go already.

83
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,325
Speaker 0: Yeah.

84
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:11,586
Speaker 0: Yeah.

85
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:14,036
Speaker 1: I guess the thing is that my new policy now.

86
00:04:14,136 --> 00:04:14,377
Speaker 1: Right.

87
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,833
Speaker 1: Which I'm trying to figure out is a good policy to have.

88
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:17,216
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

89
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:17,498
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

90
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:22,216
Speaker 0: I'm going to guess never take a new job unless it is substantially better than the previous one.

91
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:23,561
Speaker 1: Well, not just that.

92
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,507
Speaker 1: I'm not going to take any job.

93
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:27,552
Speaker 1: that isn't completely awesome.

94
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:32,592
Speaker 0: Well, I can at least say that my my change was a little more subtle.

95
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:43,951
Speaker 1: I basically one day said, look, because I've had a whole bunch of basically pretty good jobs, but none of them are the kind of place where I want to hang around for years and years and years and years.

96
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:45,397
Speaker 1: I'm not going.

97
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:57,326
Speaker 1: the next job I get, whatever it is, working for myself or someone else is going to be a job where for years and years and years and years, every single day, even like 10 years from now, I'm like, oh, man's work.

98
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:57,848
Speaker 1: Here we go.

99
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,632
Speaker 0: Rock and roll.

100
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,440
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I'm not doing it.

101
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:10,675
Speaker 0: See, my policy was pretty much I realized in the first job, you know, funny how I get like the best job ever, probably the last salary job I will ever have.

102
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:16,979
Speaker 0: And I get it when I decide that I'm not going to separate work from real life anymore.

103
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:19,328
Speaker 0: I'm not going to hide like, you know, resumes.

104
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:30,455
Speaker 0: I didn't put like gig nights or anime conventions on my resume before I put, you know, I put some things on there, but I kind of left the whole podcast thing to the side and I didn't talk about kind of my.

105
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,307
Speaker 1: See, I never hid that stuff, but it never mattered.

106
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:35,717
Speaker 0: But I finally put all that stuff on my resume.

107
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:39,232
Speaker 0: I like game theory in there and like Otacon and all this stuff.

108
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:44,495
Speaker 0: And suddenly everyone wants to interview me and suddenly all they ask about is, oh, so you do a podcast.

109
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:45,400
Speaker 0: Oh, you're on the radio.

110
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:46,808
Speaker 0: Oh, you go to conventions.

111
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,277
Speaker 0: You're a professional speaker.

112
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:48,780
Speaker 0: What's all this?

113
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,424
Speaker 0: Blah, blah, blah.

114
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:51,479
Speaker 0: And I have like the best freaking job in the world.

115
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,121
Speaker 0: Yeah.

116
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:55,754
Speaker 1: Actually, I've applied so far for one rock star job.

117
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:57,420
Speaker 0: It is a pretty rock star job.

118
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,182
Speaker 0: Scott applied to.

119
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:04,382
Speaker 1: I applied to work with Peter Rojas at record level or wherever they're calling it.

120
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:04,683
Speaker 1: Right.

121
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:09,643
Speaker 1: And which is happens to be very close physically in location to my current work.

122
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,876
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'm going to hear back from them.

123
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:19,649
Speaker 1: He hasn't emailed me back yet, but he tweeted today and I saw his tweet was someone sent me a resume, but they sent me a link to a Google doc.

124
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,279
Speaker 1: They get they score major points with me.

125
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:30,399
Speaker 1: And I'm like, ah, I was thinking of doing that, but I couldn't get the formatting to be consistent because I made a Google doc of my resume and I went and I looked at it on Linux.

126
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,390
Speaker 1: I looked at it on Windows and it didn't look the same.

127
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,260
Speaker 1: It didn't look the same in every browser.

128
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:41,268
Speaker 0: And like I had bullets on there and the realize I realized long ago, my resume has been PDFs for the last eight years.

129
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:43,599
Speaker 1: Bullets are all messed up in the different Google docs.

130
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,931
Speaker 1: So I chose not to send him a Google doc link resume instead said the PDF to get the guaranteed formatting treated him and said that I did.

131
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:55,056
Speaker 1: I did tweet him and say that I said I was thinking of doing that, but I couldn't get the formatting consistent.

132
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:57,045
Speaker 1: So I did an open office export to PDF.

133
00:06:57,546 --> 00:07:05,987
Speaker 1: But maybe next time, since I'm applying for rock star jobs with, you know, cool people, the cool people will like, you know, like the Google doc, like I don't know, you know, it's weird.

134
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,460
Speaker 1: I'll do the Google doc link and the PDF attachment.

135
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:08,862
Speaker 1: We'll see.

136
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:10,147
Speaker 0: I can't say one thing.

137
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:14,868
Speaker 0: I used to, you know, pretty much throughout RIT, I would update my resume like every couple of weeks.

138
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:16,476
Speaker 0: Like I'd keep my resume like this.

139
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,104
Speaker 0: It's always ready to go.

140
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:20,779
Speaker 0: And I'd have like the most current version, like with me all the time.

141
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:21,301
Speaker 0: And I was always.

142
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:25,315
Speaker 0: I don't even know if I have my resume anymore.

143
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:28,285
Speaker 1: I think I've always had it lying around on a disk.

144
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:32,721
Speaker 0: But the last time I made it, I made it from like my previous one.

145
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:34,669
Speaker 0: You know, it was like the ten thousand.

146
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,560
Speaker 1: I've just been updating the same resume from like two thousand and two or some shit like that, too.

147
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,545
Speaker 0: But two thousand, maybe unless the original is on one of those, like four hard drives I'm not using.

148
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:48,200
Speaker 0: All I have left is the PDF.

149
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,840
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, granted, I have, you know, the full Adobe thing.

150
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,540
Speaker 1: I think actually open office three, I think an open PDF and edit them, I think.

151
00:07:58,922 --> 00:07:59,265
Speaker 0: Yeah.

152
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:00,559
Speaker 1: The feature is something like that.

153
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,127
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'll ever pretty much.

154
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,662
Speaker 0: I don't think I need my resume for getting a job anymore.

155
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:07,560
Speaker 0: I need my resume for other things, like trying to be an expert witness.

156
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:08,444
Speaker 1: Yeah.

157
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:10,280
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you never know when you need a resume.

158
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:10,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

159
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:20,520
Speaker 1: But I feel like I think I'm just going to make my quote unquote, I mean, you're going to work at the same place for, you know, you might work there for five, maybe ten years, but you'll need another job after that.

160
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:21,423
Speaker 0: I don't know.

161
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:23,977
Speaker 1: I pretty much feel like you're going to work there for 30, 40 years.

162
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,592
Speaker 0: No, I feel like this is my penultimate job, as in I will.

163
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:34,200
Speaker 0: either this will be my career or I will leave it at a point when I no longer will be working for someone else.

164
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,114
Speaker 0: It's going to be one of the two.

165
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,462
Speaker 1: Yeah.

166
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,058
Speaker 0: Or I guess, you know, if Mad Max happens, then I'll have to get a new job.

167
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,202
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

168
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:53,380
Speaker 1: Your new job of, I guess, leading my married man, leather wearing ne'er-do-wells, corpse, hokudono Ken master or I don't know.

169
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,498
Speaker 0: I've been practicing pleather preparer.

170
00:08:58,982 --> 00:09:01,035
Speaker 0: Why do they have so much pleather, so much gasoline?

171
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:04,680
Speaker 0: I also didn't realize there were three Mad Max movies.

172
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,660
Speaker 0: I only thought there were two Mad Max, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.

173
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,620
Speaker 0: And yeah, that's the only ones I knew about.

174
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,868
Speaker 0: But I was told by multiple people there was a third one that I guess I had three even farther beyond the next three.

175
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:20,100
Speaker 1: return to Thunderdome Mad Max three Thunderdome.

176
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,979
Speaker 1: So far back there, I can't even see it.

177
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,780
Speaker 0: Actually, I think Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome might have been the third one.

178
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,488
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

179
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:27,298
Speaker 1: I don't know.

180
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,408
Speaker 1: I am DB.

181
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:29,419
Speaker 1: I call to you.

182
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:31,311
Speaker 0: All IMDB.

183
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:32,240
Speaker 0: What's your news?

184
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,400
Speaker 1: I got almost I got the Wikipedia coming through here.

185
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:35,822
Speaker 0: Fine.

186
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:36,640
Speaker 0: I'll tell you about my news.

187
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:43,940
Speaker 0: So this is not a technology thing because it happened more or less in the real world, but it used technology.

188
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:53,822
Speaker 0: But in, you know, computer science and information security, there's the idea of the man in the middle attack, which is that theoretically you have a secure line of communication.

189
00:09:54,204 --> 00:10:00,460
Speaker 0: But one way to violate that line of communication is to place yourself in the middle, an intermediary between the two people.

190
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:14,320
Speaker 0: So instead of person A talking to person B, person A talks to me and person B talks to me and I read their messages and respond to both of them accordingly, thus getting everything I want out of that conversation.

191
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,802
Speaker 1: They think they're talking to each other, but really, you are checking everything out they're doing.

192
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,910
Speaker 1: And you can even give false replies to.

193
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,627
Speaker 0: this was a huge security problem with SSH one.

194
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,540
Speaker 0: That's why we use SSH two now.

195
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:33,223
Speaker 0: But even I mean, man in the middle is ancient and there's a lot of it exists in a lot of forms.

196
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:35,200
Speaker 0: But I thought this was clever.

197
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:46,642
Speaker 0: Some dude, some Russian immigrants hacked the Department of Transportation website called Safer Sis dot org, which apparently has this list of like trucking companies and brokers.

198
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:51,664
Speaker 0: And basically it's a place where you can go and arrange shipping between places for like companies.

199
00:10:52,467 --> 00:11:04,207
Speaker 0: What they would do is they would basically use this to intercept requests for shipping, take those requests, get payment, and then subcontract those requests to the original.

200
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:08,437
Speaker 0: the people that the original people thought were the people that were contracted to do it.

201
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:13,040
Speaker 0: And then they would keep the money and or keep the goods.

202
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:14,617
Speaker 0: And that was the end of it.

203
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,629
Speaker 0: And it was good.

204
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,319
Speaker 1: They got the goods.

205
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,160
Speaker 0: I think they shipped the goods most of the time.

206
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,700
Speaker 1: I didn't read the subcontracting the good shipments.

207
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,959
Speaker 1: How could they hook if they kept the goods?

208
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:30,139
Speaker 0: Well, you could subcontract the good shipments, but then just show up before the subcontractor arrives and take the goods.

209
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,280
Speaker 0: So I show up in the AGMI Trucking Co company truck.

210
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:34,519
Speaker 0: I take the goods.

211
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:35,623
Speaker 0: I leave.

212
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:42,111
Speaker 0: The real AGMI Co truck shows up, looks for the goods, and the dude says, you already came.

213
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,520
Speaker 0: I don't think they did that.

214
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,780
Speaker 0: I think they just took the money and then left everyone confused.

215
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,287
Speaker 0: It's kind of like the.

216
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,340
Speaker 1: they're making a small profit.

217
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,060
Speaker 0: They made about five hundred thousand dollars before.

218
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:56,260
Speaker 1: You're making a small profit per thing because how much is someone going to pay?

219
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,760
Speaker 1: Because you're paying the subcontracting truck company.

220
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,540
Speaker 1: So you got to know they're only making the difference.

221
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,444
Speaker 0: That's the brilliance.

222
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:04,358
Speaker 0: They didn't actually pay the subcontracting truck company.

223
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:16,282
Speaker 0: What you realize the way the business world works, if you buy something, you don't just pay, you submit a purchase order or something along those lines and then they submit an invoice.

224
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:21,551
Speaker 0: And usually they have terms like net 30, which means the balance in full will be paid within 30 days.

225
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,239
Speaker 0: You know, that sort of business.

226
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:31,200
Speaker 0: So basically they take money from Person A, subcontract out to Person B, keep the money.

227
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,304
Speaker 0: Person B delivers the goods and then never gets paid, tries to sue Person A for not paying.

228
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:37,700
Speaker 0: Person A says, I did pay.

229
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,404
Speaker 0: Here's the proof.

230
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,159
Speaker 0: That money went to some third party who's already gone.

231
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,167
Speaker 0: It's kind of like so that so.

232
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:54,405
Speaker 1: but so the situation is such that the the subcontracted real trucking company doesn't send their invoice to the Russians if they were sending it to the Person A.

233
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,200
Speaker 0: Yes, they manned in the middle or man in the middle.

234
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:01,940
Speaker 1: I don't know how that seems like paperwork is messed up somewhere, but all right.

235
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,964
Speaker 0: Now it's probably remember.

236
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:08,019
Speaker 0: they had the middleman, they controlled the middleman, the trusted middleman.

237
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:13,240
Speaker 0: It's kind of like the the famous Chinese restaurant, Frank, only with money.

238
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:15,323
Speaker 0: I don't know.

239
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:25,540
Speaker 0: I find this interesting and I don't really have anything more insightful to say about it other than scammers in the modern world are often very, very clever.

240
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:33,075
Speaker 0: And the real failing is that the website that people trusted was untrustworthy and everyone trusted it stupidly.

241
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:39,844
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much where all you know, that's it's why it's called a con man, a confidence man.

242
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:45,699
Speaker 1: They give you confidence in something, you know, trust in something that is untrustworthy and then you are fooled.

243
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:48,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is the foundation of all trickery.

244
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:54,260
Speaker 0: It's weird, though, because I feel like I don't know if they could have gotten me because I I don't trust any website, really.

245
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:55,980
Speaker 0: Like I don't even really trust Google.

246
00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:58,439
Speaker 1: I trust Amazon.com kind of.

247
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,260
Speaker 1: Well, I trust them to send me a book and I give money.

248
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:04,779
Speaker 0: I only really trust Amazon because Visa and MasterCard have my back.

249
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:05,582
Speaker 1: Yeah.

250
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:09,060
Speaker 0: If if Visa and MasterCard didn't have me, I probably would.

251
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,579
Speaker 1: Then you're trusting Visa and MasterCard.

252
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:14,840
Speaker 0: Yes, but I trust them because if they became untrustworthy, it's Mad Max.

253
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:21,440
Speaker 1: OK, so Mad Max, Mad Max, followed by two sequels, Mad Max two, a.k.a.

254
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,178
Speaker 1: The Road Warrior.

255
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:33,480
Speaker 1: And Thunderdome came out in eighty five and as of April 08, a third sequel, Mad Max for Fury Road remains in pre-production in quotes.

256
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:34,384
Speaker 0: Oh, my.

257
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:38,742
Speaker 0: According to Wikipedia, though, I haven't seen Mad Max be on Thunderdome since I was a kid.

258
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:41,979
Speaker 0: I don't know if that movie will live up to my childhood, you know, it's.

259
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,294
Speaker 1: you know, it's beyond Thunderdome.

260
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,919
Speaker 0: Pleather and gasoline, Fury Road.

261
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:47,624
Speaker 0: OK.

262
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:48,110
Speaker 0: All right.

263
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,422
Speaker 1: So here I got.

264
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:54,488
Speaker 1: I got a little news, I guess a combo of two news and then some other news, right?

265
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:55,154
Speaker 1: All right.

266
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:55,720
Speaker 1: So here we go.

267
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,060
Speaker 1: First story, these two related stories.

268
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,580
Speaker 1: The real quick virtual quote, murderer jailed.

269
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,578
Speaker 0: Wait, is this the Dutch thing?

270
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:05,843
Speaker 1: No.

271
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:08,279
Speaker 0: OK, because there was a similar story from the Dutch.

272
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:12,660
Speaker 1: It's a Tokyo woman, right, was jailed for murdering her ex-husband.

273
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:13,403
Speaker 1: Well, kind of.

274
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:17,200
Speaker 1: She logged into his MapleStory account and killed his avatar.

275
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:21,020
Speaker 1: She's not been formally charged.

276
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:29,120
Speaker 1: If convicted, she could face up to five years in prison or find it to five thousand dollars because they're thinking of charging her with inappropriate computer access.

277
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:29,444
Speaker 0: All right.

278
00:15:29,484 --> 00:15:30,497
Speaker 0: I was that makes sense.

279
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:31,531
Speaker 1: All right.

280
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:32,080
Speaker 1: But it's weird.

281
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,740
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, she she killed a virtual character.

282
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,339
Speaker 1: She basically twiddled some bits in the database.

283
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,280
Speaker 0: You know, it's funny that every time there's a story like this, whatever book we read most recently has a lot to say about it.

284
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,278
Speaker 0: All I want to say, Scott, is the sibrid.

285
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:45,947
Speaker 1: Right.

286
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:46,271
Speaker 1: Yeah.

287
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:46,860
Speaker 0: Anyway.

288
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:47,643
Speaker 1: All right.

289
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:48,129
Speaker 1: So here we go.

290
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:48,898
Speaker 1: Here's the Dutch thing.

291
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:51,399
Speaker 0: Oh, so you are talking about the Dutch thing.

292
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:53,980
Speaker 1: Teens convicted of virtual theft.

293
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,401
Speaker 1: Right.

294
00:15:55,083 --> 00:16:03,499
Speaker 1: Two Dutch teenagers were convicted of virtually roughing up a classmate in RuneScape and stealing virtual goods.

295
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,400
Speaker 1: The quote, virtual goods are goods under Dutch law.

296
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:09,369
Speaker 1: So this is theft.

297
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:10,600
Speaker 1: The court said on Tuesday.

298
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:11,795
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

299
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:15,620
Speaker 0: Was this like they killed him in a PVP server and took his stuff?

300
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:22,900
Speaker 1: No, that's what I thought it was, because that's because if that's what it was, I would say that's way wrong.

301
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:30,641
Speaker 1: But actually what happened was they were like at his house or some shit or in school or I don't know.

302
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:43,984
Speaker 1: And they they literally roughed him up and coerced him, you know, to give them his like fancy helmet and fancy sword or some shit is sort of spare and magic helmet.

303
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:44,225
Speaker 1: Yes.

304
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:47,781
Speaker 1: So basically instead, basically it's no different than beating up for lunch money.

305
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:53,046
Speaker 1: It's just they beat him up for, you know, hey, click on that and give me that fancy item.

306
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:54,459
Speaker 1: No, I'll do it.

307
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:55,677
Speaker 1: Oh, here you go.

308
00:16:56,381 --> 00:17:02,562
Speaker 0: The real the real question here is, did the I mean, the Mabel story, they could just restore it.

309
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:08,045
Speaker 0: I mean, shouldn't the first thing I mean, but shouldn't my idea of a justice system as that the first?

310
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:12,242
Speaker 0: the first thing a justice system should always do is undo harm if possible.

311
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:18,920
Speaker 0: So I feel like the first thing before we even think about punishing anyone is just give the person their stuff back.

312
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,240
Speaker 0: There's an audit trail in both of these cases.

313
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:21,983
Speaker 1: Right.

314
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:23,959
Speaker 1: There is the other question, though, right?

315
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:46,900
Speaker 1: Do you really want this seems to be sort of this this way of the world in which when you have a game and a game has rules, be it video game or sport or whatever, right, that like you don't really want the world government like coming in and modifying the rules of games, which are sort of like, you know, atomic in their nature.

316
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,502
Speaker 1: Right.

317
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:52,160
Speaker 1: I mean, like it's OK if say something happens in a hockey game.

318
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:52,786
Speaker 1: Right.

319
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:54,020
Speaker 1: And there's a disputed goal.

320
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:59,025
Speaker 1: And the NHL comes down the next day and says, all right, we've decided that that's a goal.

321
00:17:59,106 --> 00:17:59,898
Speaker 1: This team wins.

322
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:08,230
Speaker 1: Even if it's after the game is over and they override the ref, it seems OK, like you can accept the NHL ruling itself.

323
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:09,757
Speaker 1: if the U.S.

324
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:19,680
Speaker 1: government comes in and some judge says, no, we decided it's not a goal, something something that's sort of at least a really bad taste in the mouth.

325
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:22,080
Speaker 0: But at the same time, forget the game aspect.

326
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:23,104
Speaker 0: This wasn't an.

327
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:30,280
Speaker 0: this was one of those situations of, you know, someone in the MMO scam, someone else in the MMO in the context of the game.

328
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,140
Speaker 0: This was a case of in the physical world, someone was extorted.

329
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:43,863
Speaker 0: It's no different than I mean, by that, I would say that what if I was playing the ATM game and someone forced me to take out a bunch of money from the ATM game and give it to them?

330
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:44,660
Speaker 0: Right.

331
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:59,979
Speaker 1: But if you look at like like, you know, Pete Rosebud and all those baseball games and there was some crooked refs in the NBA and stuff, but they don't you know that it was how it was, you know, you don't go back and retcon that shit, you know, you let it be and you just fix it for the future.

332
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,558
Speaker 0: You know, and if so, I think so, we shouldn't give the money back from the ATM game, the ATM games, different game.

333
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:06,960
Speaker 0: Why?

334
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:14,262
Speaker 1: Because banks, you know, because the much, much in the way you're reaching, I got it.

335
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:14,646
Speaker 1: You ready?

336
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:15,597
Speaker 1: I got you.

337
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:23,379
Speaker 1: You got it much in the way that the commissioner of the NFL right is, you know, sort of the boss of all the rules of the NFL.

338
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:24,042
Speaker 1: Right.

339
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:30,720
Speaker 1: When it comes to banks, the House of Representatives is the boss, you know, and the Senate Banking Committee is the boss.

340
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:35,618
Speaker 1: So so what if I have their decision in the in the rules of banking and money?

341
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:38,020
Speaker 1: the same way you would accept the decision of the commissioner?

342
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,360
Speaker 0: Fine.

343
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:43,200
Speaker 0: I'm playing the grocery store game and someone takes all my groceries.

344
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:44,325
Speaker 0: Yeah.

345
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:45,417
Speaker 0: From the parking lot.

346
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:46,711
Speaker 0: Now, now who's?

347
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:47,540
Speaker 0: who has the authority?

348
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:49,172
Speaker 1: Well, you're on U.S.

349
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:50,019
Speaker 1: government land.

350
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:52,620
Speaker 1: No, I'm not physical goods and commerce.

351
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,786
Speaker 0: I'm not on government land.

352
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:54,451
Speaker 0: It's owned by.

353
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:55,560
Speaker 0: it's owned by the supermarket.

354
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,359
Speaker 1: The government is the boss of commerce.

355
00:19:57,982 --> 00:20:02,164
Speaker 0: But by that logic, the government is also the boss of any game that is in the United States.

356
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:04,080
Speaker 1: Technically, yes.

357
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,440
Speaker 1: Therefore, you realize it is a bad taste if they're infiltrating into the game and not just in the commerce level.

358
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,767
Speaker 1: Like if World of Warcraft took my money, even though I canceled my account, then that's commerce that they can.

359
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,420
Speaker 1: they can come in and do something about.

360
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:23,287
Speaker 1: But if, you know, someone takes my purse, I don't know if the government should really be stepping in.

361
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:24,200
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know.

362
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:35,500
Speaker 0: I feel like if some of the problem here is whether or not those things have intrinsic value, I would argue, no, because the company in question can recreate them immediately and without any sort of consequences whatsoever.

363
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:36,863
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just.

364
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:37,827
Speaker 1: it's a state of.

365
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:44,440
Speaker 1: you're basically saying you're the state of a system rather than, you know, the possession of actual goods.

366
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,540
Speaker 1: And it's not possession.

367
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:46,473
Speaker 1: It's I don't know.

368
00:20:47,022 --> 00:20:48,980
Speaker 0: Well, see, that's the real interesting thing.

369
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:52,779
Speaker 0: How do we define possession of digital goods like that?

370
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,200
Speaker 0: What do what do I own that's different?

371
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,700
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, theoretically, right, it's like there's all this translation on different levels of the universe between state and position.

372
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,220
Speaker 1: I mean, everything possession I mean, everything is state.

373
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,360
Speaker 1: It's what are the configurations of all the subatomic particles in the entire universe?

374
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:12,414
Speaker 1: And that is everything.

375
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:12,799
Speaker 1: Right.

376
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:15,740
Speaker 1: But then you look and it's like I possess this land.

377
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,660
Speaker 1: Well, no, actually, it's just the configuration of the universe.

378
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:19,831
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

379
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:20,620
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

380
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,719
Speaker 0: That has your name on it.

381
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,319
Speaker 1: That happens to also say deed on it.

382
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:24,640
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, Captain.

383
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:25,262
Speaker 0: Absolute.

384
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:30,019
Speaker 0: I think we need to zoom in a little bit from your overarching, pedantic and positive.

385
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,776
Speaker 0: You've you've committed not the fallacy, but the I don't even have a word for this,

386
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:36,780
Speaker 1: where

387
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:52,680
Speaker 0: you take an argument and either draw it out to such a universal concept to where it is universally applicable and thus no longer an argument or zoom in so narrowly that you have proven something absolutely which can have no effect on anything.

388
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:58,524
Speaker 1: I did both, in fact, by going to the subatomic particles and also the entire universe at the same time.

389
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:07,089
Speaker 0: I feel like the difference here, though, in all honesty, in this situation versus, say, someone in the game tricking me into giving perps, I don't even know if you can give people perps.

390
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:08,280
Speaker 0: I know there's like bonding and stuff.

391
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,080
Speaker 1: And I'm sure you can give someone an item, right?

392
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:10,884
Speaker 0: No, there's this.

393
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:21,215
Speaker 0: you can if you pick up certain items, they're bound to you and no one else can use it really to prevent what the fuck to prevent all the sorts of things that happened in every MMO that came before.

394
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,600
Speaker 1: Oh, God, even I got it, man, we should actually play.

395
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:25,921
Speaker 1: Wow.

396
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:29,381
Speaker 1: So we can find all the stupid shit like that and realize it's worse than we think it is.

397
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:30,686
Speaker 0: You want to play.

398
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:34,704
Speaker 1: while I'm looking at, you know, this we have like one hundred demo days.

399
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:36,340
Speaker 0: Some, you know, I got one right here.

400
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:39,900
Speaker 1: We said we were going to do it for like one day last winter.

401
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:41,940
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I got on a vacation time.

402
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,337
Speaker 0: I'll be off for like a week or two around New Year's.

403
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we'll say we want to play two solid weeks of wild.

404
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:48,920
Speaker 0: No, I'll take two weeks off.

405
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,560
Speaker 1: I'm talking like maybe two hours, two weeks.

406
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,322
Speaker 1: What's wrong with you?

407
00:22:55,184 --> 00:22:58,294
Speaker 0: But anyway, I feel like the.

408
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:13,464
Speaker 0: I don't know where exactly the line is, but there is a difference between being scammed in the context of the game and being physically coerced in the real world to giving up a password to an account from which items are then liquidated.

409
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:22,844
Speaker 1: Normally a story with the headline, you know, teens convicted of virtual theft or virtual murder or jailed are the kind of headlines I would go, boo, what the fuck, what the fuck?

410
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:25,860
Speaker 1: But I agree with what happened in both these situations.

411
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:27,760
Speaker 1: I think it was, you know, it was right.

412
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:29,220
Speaker 1: We did what was supposed to happen.

413
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:33,435
Speaker 0: Of course, it it really depends because who owned that MapleStory account?

414
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:39,819
Speaker 0: and if he gave her the password and they and she had ever played it, then I think she has just as much a right to delete the characters he does.

415
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, plus, right.

416
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:45,360
Speaker 1: Maybe, you know, he was letting her play or whatever she meant.

417
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,349
Speaker 1: But, you know, plus, you know, does the intent.

418
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,702
Speaker 1: intent matters in, you know, crimes and such?

419
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:52,720
Speaker 1: What if she was intending to just play MapleStory, but she just sucked?

420
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:54,759
Speaker 1: You know, how does how does that go?

421
00:23:55,283 --> 00:23:56,399
Speaker 0: Well, I think she deleted it.

422
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,799
Speaker 0: I don't know how if you can die.

423
00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,339
Speaker 0: I don't know how MapleStory works.

424
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:00,965
Speaker 0: Wasn't that the game?

425
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:03,300
Speaker 0: that looked really good, but there was actually no gameplay.

426
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,580
Speaker 1: It's like a side scrolling.

427
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,121
Speaker 1: Nothing.

428
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:05,624
Speaker 1: I forget.

429
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:09,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember playing it and then we got hooked on that other game Gunbound.

430
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:13,140
Speaker 1: Well, Gunbound was the cannon fodder, but you pay money to win.

431
00:24:13,441 --> 00:24:13,602
Speaker 0: Yes.

432
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:15,740
Speaker 0: That introduced one word to my vocabulary.

433
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,699
Speaker 0: The only thing I remember from that game is bungeeing.

434
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,039
Speaker 1: Oh, God, I forgot about that.

435
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:22,617
Speaker 1: I had something else to talk about, but I'm going to save it.

436
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:31,010
Speaker 0: Anyway, things of the day.

437
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:40,707
Speaker 0: So Wyatt was a classy dude, was out for the weekend and we went hiking and stuff, but he showed us something and I'm going to inflict this upon all of you.

438
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:49,730
Speaker 0: Someone made these people make, among other things, alternate openers to television shows.

439
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,990
Speaker 0: And I want to link to two of them.

440
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:57,590
Speaker 0: Now, the first one is frightening, horrifying and really not safe for word.

441
00:24:57,711 --> 00:25:00,209
Speaker 0: But it is kind of an alternate opener to DuckTales.

442
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:02,870
Speaker 0: And it's a little disturbing.

443
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,830
Speaker 1: I feel like I've seen it before somewhere, but I don't remember.

444
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,670
Speaker 0: Where were you here when we show it, when we know, but I think is it that new?

445
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,309
Speaker 1: Because I feel like I saw it a long time ago.

446
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:18,352
Speaker 0: I have no idea now, but in case you don't want to watch that one, I have to link to a second one.

447
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:22,550
Speaker 0: And this one's just weird and it's funny.

448
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:27,790
Speaker 0: And it kind of reminds me of the Hasselhoff recursion for a number of reasons.

449
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,289
Speaker 1: Well, it does involve the Hoff.

450
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,389
Speaker 0: It does, but it involves a recursion of the Hoff as well.

451
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,190
Speaker 0: But it is not the Hasselhoff recursion.

452
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,027
Speaker 0: It is perhaps a Hasselhoff recursion, but Hasselhoff is played by another guy.

453
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:42,978
Speaker 0: Well, there is only one.

454
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:44,490
Speaker 0: This is definitely a bastardization.

455
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,590
Speaker 0: It is not the true recursion in all of its glory.

456
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:56,470
Speaker 0: But if the first one is disturbing and funny in a really dark humor, sick way, the second one is just really weird.

457
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:07,970
Speaker 0: When the little mini Knight Riders come out and start shooting missiles at the big Knight Rider, that is itself in a pow pow power wheel, riding around in a cube that has images of the opener to Knight Rider on all faces.

458
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:09,930
Speaker 0: It's weird.

459
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:11,773
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

460
00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:13,409
Speaker 1: Is that it?

461
00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:15,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

462
00:26:15,245 --> 00:26:15,690
Speaker 0: What do you have?

463
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,830
Speaker 0: Something more exciting.

464
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,990
Speaker 0: Captain Scott on this lazy Thursday.

465
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,666
Speaker 1: It's exciting if you like boobies.

466
00:26:22,574 --> 00:26:23,058
Speaker 0: The bird?

467
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:23,119
Speaker 0: No.

468
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,799
Speaker 1: OK.

469
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:27,170
Speaker 1: The things on women.

470
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,290
Speaker 0: I can tell it's going to be a classy night.

471
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,193
Speaker 1: Oh, it's classy.

472
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:34,309
Speaker 1: So Halloween's coming up pretty soon.

473
00:26:34,874 --> 00:26:36,449
Speaker 1: Halloween is all about costumes.

474
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:37,297
Speaker 1: Yes.

475
00:26:37,318 --> 00:26:37,359
Speaker 1: No.

476
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:37,848
Speaker 1: Yes.

477
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:38,735
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.

478
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:40,169
Speaker 1: Well, costumes and pumpkins.

479
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,450
Speaker 0: Halloween is primarily about parties and dressing up for candy.

480
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:46,269
Speaker 0: Yes, mostly parties.

481
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:49,730
Speaker 1: So to celebrate the costumes of Halloween, right.

482
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,270
Speaker 1: You know, some people, they like the scary costumes.

483
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:57,070
Speaker 1: Some people like the funny costumes and some people like the sexy costumes.

484
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,570
Speaker 0: Sexiness, sexy.

485
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,509
Speaker 1: No, not all the costumes are sexy.

486
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:06,230
Speaker 1: And anyway, sexy, sexy and frog.

487
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:13,336
Speaker 1: OK, here are someone put together this gallery of the 50 best cosplay cleavage pics.

488
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:14,229
Speaker 1: All right.

489
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,470
Speaker 0: And should this not be saved for a Wednesday?

490
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,978
Speaker 1: I don't know.

491
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,190
Speaker 0: Some of them are video games.

492
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,317
Speaker 1: Some of them are anime.

493
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:24,130
Speaker 1: Some of them are just sort of who knows what they are.

494
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,609
Speaker 1: They're just cosplay of some sort.

495
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:28,230
Speaker 0: I still feel like it fits mostly in a Woden's Day.

496
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:38,430
Speaker 1: Perhaps, but no matter what, normally I wouldn't link to something like this, you know, because normally it's just sort of a perverted kind of, yeah, whatever.

497
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,890
Speaker 1: Fan service, cheesecake, sexist kind of thing.

498
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,948
Speaker 0: You realize Steve Bennett has probably checked off one more mark on the.

499
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:45,509
Speaker 0: I will corrupt those two boys.

500
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,490
Speaker 1: But some of these are way hot.

501
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:58,970
Speaker 1: Like, I don't know what no matter what gender you are, some of these are like unbelievably hot, like, oh, man, like, who the hell is that hot?

502
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:04,030
Speaker 1: Like, oh, man, like you don't see things this hot on the Internet every day.

503
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:05,469
Speaker 1: I mean, the Internet's got a lot of porn.

504
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,232
Speaker 1: You know, it's got more porn than anything in the history of, you know, the universe.

505
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:18,612
Speaker 0: But most of that porn, the statistic that more porn, more pornographic video is made in every 20, that's just any, you know, real porn industry.

506
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:26,390
Speaker 1: More porn is made, you know, not counting like photography, porn, internet porn and, you know, all the other porns, but hentais and everything.

507
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,810
Speaker 1: But, you know, there's a lot of porn on the Internet.

508
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,010
Speaker 1: A lot of it is, you know, not so great.

509
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:35,275
Speaker 1: In fact, 99 percent of it is not so great coming from you, the expert in connoisseur.

510
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:35,842
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

511
00:28:35,903 --> 00:28:36,470
Speaker 1: I'm such an expert.

512
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,497
Speaker 1: No, it's Sturgeon's Law.

513
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:39,190
Speaker 1: Every 90 percent of everything is crap.

514
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:47,833
Speaker 0: You know, one needs to tell you that, you know, you know, the phrase 90 percent of everything is crap takes on a whole new meaning when talking about pornography.

515
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:54,750
Speaker 1: I hope 90 percent of the porn isn't crap that way, even though more than zero percent of it is, which is more than enough.

516
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,310
Speaker 0: You still haven't seen that video.

517
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,190
Speaker 1: Because I'm smart, just like I haven't seen all that bad porn.

518
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,950
Speaker 1: But regardless, this isn't actually porn.

519
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,889
Speaker 1: It's, you know, just cosplay photos.

520
00:29:06,171 --> 00:29:12,509
Speaker 1: Just, you know, they just happen to be, you know, provocative, even if there is no provocative is the word.

521
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:13,468
Speaker 1: There's no nudity.

522
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:19,089
Speaker 1: There's no there's nothing that would be, you know, rated X here.

523
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:24,702
Speaker 1: So no, no, it's not only it's actually any nipples, even though it's a lot of cleavage.

524
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,070
Speaker 0: Cosplayers seem to be pretty good at that.

525
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:32,989
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember very clearly a long time ago at an anime convention, there was a girl dressed up as Ray.

526
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:42,690
Speaker 0: What when Ray was wearing nothing but a towel and this girl was wearing nothing but a towel and foot pads because she wasn't allowed to walk around barefoot.

527
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:48,609
Speaker 0: So she had these flesh colored pads on the bottom of her feet that technically counted as shoes and a towel.

528
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:50,058
Speaker 0: And a wig.

529
00:29:50,342 --> 00:29:50,949
Speaker 0: And that was it.

530
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:59,150
Speaker 0: And yet she somehow managed, as far as I could see, to avoid showing a nipple or anything less savory for the entire convention.

531
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, now, what kind of reaction is that?

532
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,610
Speaker 1: I was listening to what you were saying.

533
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,970
Speaker 1: I was looking at some Internet, some Internet.

534
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,149
Speaker 0: You were looking at your own website.

535
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,929
Speaker 1: Actually, I closed that already.

536
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:12,607
Speaker 0: So what were you looking at?

537
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,870
Speaker 1: You know, just some random shit, whatever.

538
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,735
Speaker 1: Let's get on with it.

539
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:17,610
Speaker 0: So we're back to the crap thing, I see.

540
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:21,889
Speaker 0: Yes, OK, we didn't have much to do.

541
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,070
Speaker 1: And, you know, you can tell this is this is not going to be crab people night.

542
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:27,430
Speaker 0: It was a crab people night indeed.

543
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:34,750
Speaker 0: And we had a crab people from earlier in the week and all week it was, yeah, if we don't come up with a better show by Thursday, let's talk about this.

544
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:36,609
Speaker 0: The thing we were about to talk about.

545
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:40,890
Speaker 0: I like how we always act like we're not going to reveal until the last second.

546
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're the one who acts like we're not going to reveal.

547
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,715
Speaker 1: I'm just sitting here going.

548
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:45,809
Speaker 1: whatever you always go along is real hungry.

549
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:48,189
Speaker 1: I kind of just want to eat.

550
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,450
Speaker 0: We could just stop now and do a special.

551
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:53,030
Speaker 1: No, no, let's let's do something.

552
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:59,375
Speaker 1: At least people, people, they spend their hard earned Internet bandwidths to download this.

553
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:02,970
Speaker 1: And they're they're expecting something to listen to to entertain them on the way to work.

554
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,090
Speaker 1: If we stop now, what do they do for the second half of their commute?

555
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,030
Speaker 1: So what do they do while they're bored at work all day playing flash games?

556
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:11,161
Speaker 1: They played every flash game.

557
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,010
Speaker 1: Now, what are they going to do?

558
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,866
Speaker 1: We need we can save them for the next 15 to 20 minutes.

559
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:21,810
Speaker 1: And give them something to occupy their brains until they can finally escape and go home and do something worthwhile.

560
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:29,043
Speaker 0: So when we were in college for one, not even a whole year, but for three quarters of our time of our freshman year of our

561
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:29,344
Speaker 0: I.T.,

562
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:32,044
Speaker 0: when I say quarters, I don't mean, you know, 25 percent.

563
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,610
Speaker 0: I mean, quarters as in 10 weeks plus a week of finals.

564
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,116
Speaker 1: So for 30 weeks, well, 33 weeks.

565
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:40,694
Speaker 1: All right.

566
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:41,489
Speaker 1: Thirty three weeks.

567
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:46,149
Speaker 0: Plus all the vacations where we weren't forced to go home, which were all of them, except the Xmas one.

568
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,377
Speaker 0: Right.

569
00:31:47,397 --> 00:31:48,448
Speaker 0: We lived in dorms.

570
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,049
Speaker 1: Well, the RIT dorms.

571
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we lived in dorms is a correct statement.

572
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess.

573
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:54,982
Speaker 1: Yeah.

574
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:55,470
Speaker 1: All right.

575
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:06,513
Speaker 0: Except for the few friends we had who because of RIT's money grubbing and the fact that they always have more students than dorms because half those people will fail out before the end of their freshman year and then there'll be plenty of dorms.

576
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:11,469
Speaker 0: We had some friends who were actually staying in the hotel down the street on RIT's dime.

577
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:21,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you know, the thing that I think the reason dorm life require warrants discussion is because, you know, some people, you know, they love that dorm life.

578
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,590
Speaker 1: They live in dorms like their whole college time.

579
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,690
Speaker 1: They'll even live in dorms when they're out of college.

580
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:33,230
Speaker 1: You know, maybe in the military, you know, dormitory style living or or who knows what, you know, hostels and things.

581
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:37,030
Speaker 1: But some people dorms just don't work.

582
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,230
Speaker 1: They just you know, they they fight with every roommate.

583
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:40,368
Speaker 1: They can't deal with it.

584
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,431
Speaker 1: They always get new roommates switching dorms, having troubles, et cetera, et cetera.

585
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:48,810
Speaker 1: And, you know, there's there's a lot of things that people need to know about dorm life.

586
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:55,290
Speaker 1: If you're on your way to college, maybe you're in college, maybe you've never lived away from home before, like a lot of people scarily have.

587
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:03,310
Speaker 1: Really, if you're going to college, you before you go to college, you should at some point live away from home for some amount of time.

588
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:10,790
Speaker 1: You know, spend a month in a foreign country or go to summer camp at least to summer camp, not day camp or or something.

589
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:13,070
Speaker 1: You don't want to go to college and go to the dorms.

590
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,370
Speaker 1: That would be the first time you're away from mommy and daddy.

591
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,109
Speaker 1: That's that's not going to be good for you.

592
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,733
Speaker 0: But one thing I do want to say, this is not going to be one of those how to not suck shows.

593
00:33:21,753 --> 00:33:28,531
Speaker 0: We're not going to preach at you about how to live in dorms and how to deal with it and what to do and all the stuff we usually do in these kinds of shows.

594
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:42,492
Speaker 0: I pretty much just want to talk about the RIT dorms because I got to say and I could say this, too, about when we lived on campus, not in the dorms, but in the on campus apartments, you know, the the original geekhouse, the basement of colony.

595
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:45,910
Speaker 0: God, we could do a whole show about that place.

596
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:58,169
Speaker 0: But what I miss about the dorms and I get this a little bit in New York City, but not nearly as much as I got back at RIT, was the fact that not a day would go by where something weird didn't happen.

597
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,330
Speaker 0: Something weird always happened.

598
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,849
Speaker 0: There's always the weird dude, the explosion, the fire, the naked guy screaming and running down the street.

599
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:09,650
Speaker 0: The frisbeeing and frisbeeing does not involve throwing a frisbee.

600
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:10,862
Speaker 0: I'll get to that later.

601
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:11,350
Speaker 1: Yeah.

602
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,989
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, when you live in a house with just a few people, right?

603
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,431
Speaker 1: Think about it.

604
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:22,770
Speaker 1: The average person has something weird happen in their life once every few weeks, once every month, you know, something like that.

605
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,031
Speaker 1: Right.

606
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:27,889
Speaker 1: But if you get enough people together, something interesting will happen to someone every day.

607
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:32,672
Speaker 1: And if you're living with these people, then that interesting thing happens to everyone.

608
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:44,530
Speaker 1: And also, in addition to that, because you're living with these other people and, you know, and you interact in these ways, people will do things with other people and they'll make interesting things happen.

609
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:50,130
Speaker 1: And, you know, because it's a lot easier to make a lot of different things happen when there's other people to make them happen, too.

610
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,250
Speaker 1: If you don't have anyone else to pull a prank on, there's no prank to pull.

611
00:34:54,370 --> 00:35:01,610
Speaker 0: But at the same time, college dorms far and away from everything else have this extra bonus going for them in terms of this sort of stuff happening.

612
00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:10,070
Speaker 0: One, generally, I mean, it depends on the college, but, you know, RIT in particular, it was pretty much just nerds and geeks.

613
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:16,674
Speaker 0: I mean, even the drunken frat boys were drunken frat boys playing FPS and counterstrut.

614
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:19,790
Speaker 1: Or drunken frat boys writing software programs.

615
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,592
Speaker 0: Or drunken frat boys constructing their own hot tubs and then lying in them in the winter.

616
00:35:24,632 --> 00:35:24,893
Speaker 0: Yeah.

617
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:28,008
Speaker 1: I mean, even, you know, because think about it at RIT, right?

618
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,258
Speaker 1: Think about this, right?

619
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:30,490
Speaker 1: At most schools, right?

620
00:35:30,972 --> 00:35:38,229
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, all the whatever majors, you know, all the normal majors, I don't even know what they are, are the normal people, the frat boys and whatnot.

621
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:40,290
Speaker 1: And then the engineers are the nerds.

622
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:47,876
Speaker 1: At RIT, everyone's a nerd and the engineers are the least nerdy, the jock frat types.

623
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was kind of engineering.

624
00:35:51,072 --> 00:35:53,490
Speaker 1: Or maybe the School of Science also has some non nerds.

625
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,189
Speaker 1: But all the other schools, right, is the what?

626
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,370
Speaker 1: The computer science school and the art school.

627
00:35:57,712 --> 00:35:57,933
Speaker 0: Yep.

628
00:35:58,134 --> 00:36:03,290
Speaker 0: But I guess the business school, but everyone, even the business school people, though, a lot of them were really geeky.

629
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,150
Speaker 0: I mean, everyone played Counter-Strike.

630
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,355
Speaker 0: Everyone did all that stuff.

631
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:08,890
Speaker 0: Everyone did those geeky, nerdy things.

632
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:21,450
Speaker 0: And also because RIT is kind of expensive and private and all these things, it was also at the point where, by and large, everyone there had a lot of similar interests, a lot of commonalities.

633
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:24,410
Speaker 0: And also we were isolated.

634
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,690
Speaker 0: Remember, RIT, everyone says, yeah, it's in Rochester.

635
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,530
Speaker 0: Now, it's not in Rochester.

636
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:31,790
Speaker 0: It's in Henrietta, which is next to Rochester.

637
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:40,729
Speaker 1: Henrietta, at least from the perspective of an RIT student, basically Henrietta might as well just be called RIT town, even though people live in it.

638
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:48,390
Speaker 0: You arrive at basically RIT is like this compound that is completely isolated from the entirety of the rest of the area.

639
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:58,649
Speaker 0: And not many of the freshmen have cars and not many people in general in the community did not fit into anything we're going to talk about.

640
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:02,668
Speaker 0: And you're isolated and you have nowhere to go and nothing to do.

641
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:04,929
Speaker 1: And where can you go?

642
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:06,830
Speaker 1: There's one road in Henrietta.

643
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:10,170
Speaker 1: It basically has a bunch of strip malls and then one actual mall.

644
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:10,411
Speaker 0: Yeah.

645
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:11,829
Speaker 0: And you couldn't even walk there.

646
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,370
Speaker 0: If you wanted to walk there, it took forever.

647
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,670
Speaker 0: And also I point out it's basically the ice planet Hoth.

648
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,968
Speaker 0: So you can't walk there.

649
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's very limited time.

650
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:22,650
Speaker 1: And add in one more thing to this equation.

651
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,749
Speaker 1: You know, the sort of the eye of Newt, if you will.

652
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:27,770
Speaker 1: Everyone's a college student.

653
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,048
Speaker 1: They've got loads of free time to kill.

654
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:32,350
Speaker 1: They're not people working nine to five.

655
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:36,070
Speaker 1: These are people who are in those dorms a lot of the time.

656
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:45,349
Speaker 0: And the way RIT tends to work is that your freshman year, with a few exceptions, there is very little difficult going on.

657
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,438
Speaker 0: At least for the majority, we can.

658
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,270
Speaker 0: basically the people who are going to fail out are going to fail out already.

659
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:56,150
Speaker 0: Like the fact that you were going to fail out of RIT almost feels like it was predetermined from before you even decided to go there.

660
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, much like in high school.

661
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:02,969
Speaker 1: When I was in high school, my freshman year, I had like these like amazing grades and then I started to let it slide the rest of high school.

662
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,510
Speaker 0: Freshman year at RIT, 4.0.

663
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:09,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, freshman year at RIT, I was like way, I was doing, kicking out all sorts of ads.

664
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,411
Speaker 0: Sophomore year, 3.8.

665
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:10,857
Speaker 0: Then it went,

666
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:11,080
Speaker 0: "Ding!"

667
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:13,369
Speaker 0: I'll go by year by year.

668
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:20,512
Speaker 0: 4.0, 3.8, 3.7, 3.41.

669
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:23,590
Speaker 1: I don't even remember what it was, but it was pretty much right away.

670
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,608
Speaker 1: It was like all A's.

671
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,107
Speaker 0: No, no.

672
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,667
Speaker 0: Think about that.

673
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:34,330
Speaker 0: To drop so quickly, my senior year, with all the momentum of grades I had before that, yeah, I didn't really go to class.

674
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,210
Speaker 0: I didn't really do, I skipped a final.

675
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,170
Speaker 1: Strangely enough though, I made the Dean's list once at RIT ever.

676
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,430
Speaker 1: And it was my final, like year, final quarter.

677
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,230
Speaker 1: I don't know what that was about, but we're not talking about RIT.

678
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,489
Speaker 0: We're talking about living in the dorms.

679
00:38:48,610 --> 00:39:05,370
Speaker 0: Now, one thing about living in the dorms was that for the majority of students, no one had any schoolwork to do because either you are one of the people who will not fail out of RIT, which means everything you do your freshman year is painfully easy, or you're one of the people who are going to fail out of RIT.

680
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:05,870
Speaker 0: In which case.

681
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,769
Speaker 1: You're not doing your work.

682
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,220
Speaker 0: Yep.

683
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:14,569
Speaker 1: Now there were some people, you know, the bookworms, the people who have the nose to the book all the time, even though there's, I don't know what the hell they were working on.

684
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,970
Speaker 1: Like it was the weirdest thing.

685
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,529
Speaker 1: I would, I would be in a class.

686
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,790
Speaker 1: Someone else would be in the same class, right?

687
00:39:20,473 --> 00:39:24,110
Speaker 1: I would've, I would've, you know, felt that I had no work to do for that class yet.

688
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:38,989
Speaker 1: I would see someone else in that class with the book for that class, like in the library, spending a lot of time in there doing something, but at class, there are people in the dorms who'd be on those quiet floors and those people would just do work and they wouldn't do anything else.

689
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:43,867
Speaker 0: We're not talking about the quiet floors because I got to say, I know very little about them.

690
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:50,450
Speaker 0: I went to one a couple of times when I was working on a project with someone my freshman year, they were scary.

691
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:56,130
Speaker 0: Like everyone in there was really, really scared except for like the three or four people who were stuck.

692
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:03,510
Speaker 0: Like they didn't want to be on that floor, but either their parents forced him to be on that floor or they ended up there because no one wanted to be on that floor.

693
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:12,210
Speaker 0: And basically those people never spend any time on that floor, but we could really only talk about our own doors because every dorm had its own character.

694
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,410
Speaker 1: I know that's what it's all about.

695
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,890
Speaker 1: I was just about to say the thing about floors, right?

696
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:19,130
Speaker 1: Each dorm, each floor, each section, right?

697
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:27,630
Speaker 1: When however the dorms are architecturally structured, you know, each unit has its own character and its own community and its own attitude.

698
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,950
Speaker 0: Well, it had its own name, its own RA, and then as a group, they had their own RD.

699
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:37,327
Speaker 0: And we really only have experience with four of the dorm, I don't know, social units of RIT.

700
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,668
Speaker 1: So I have some interactions with some other units, but yes, I know I'm most familiar with it.

701
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:48,970
Speaker 0: I know them in the way that a visitor to a foreign land for a few weeks of a year knows the foreign land.

702
00:40:49,251 --> 00:40:50,970
Speaker 0: I mean, here's what I know.

703
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,730
Speaker 0: I mean, there are people who probably are nothing like the people, all the things we're going to talk about on all those other weird floors.

704
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:12,109
Speaker 0: But let me tell you, all I know about the study, the studying floors was that I never saw any of those people outside of those floors or outside of class, maybe in the library, but I only went in the library when I needed to sleep.

705
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,910
Speaker 1: I went to the library, but not as much as some people.

706
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,170
Speaker 0: Actually, you know, I can say I did a lot more work in the library for my elective classes than I ever did for anything else.

707
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,638
Speaker 1: I did a lot more things in the library just for fun, looking around, because it's a big library.

708
00:41:24,658 --> 00:41:25,310
Speaker 1: They got a lot of books.

709
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,628
Speaker 1: There's a lot of weird stuff in there.

710
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:31,185
Speaker 0: But I didn't get to pick my dorm and I didn't really like.

711
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:34,390
Speaker 0: I put in some preferences, but I tried to get into computer science house.

712
00:41:34,511 --> 00:41:35,469
Speaker 0: Not going to talk about that.

713
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,048
Speaker 1: No, I'm glad I didn't get in.

714
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:37,543
Speaker 1: Me too.

715
00:41:38,272 --> 00:41:43,890
Speaker 0: But I ended up in in one of the more infamous of the places to live at RIT.

716
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,106
Speaker 0: I lived in Fish B.

717
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,730
Speaker 1: Well, Fish B, too, right?

718
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:47,292
Speaker 0: Fish B, too.

719
00:41:47,312 --> 00:41:59,130
Speaker 0: Well, fish in and of itself was special because there was Fish A, which was completely separate from Fish B and C. And Fish A had the girls, but there's girls only.

720
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:06,249
Speaker 0: In fact, Fish B was special in that I believe it housed the majority of the alcoholics at RIT at the time.

721
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,627
Speaker 1: Fish, because it was all boys, wasn't it?

722
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,494
Speaker 0: Fish B, I believe was all.

723
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:17,249
Speaker 0: fish B, too, however, was unique among RIT floors because most of RIT's dorms were unisex.

724
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:25,786
Speaker 1: You know, you mean you didn't have girls and guys in the same room, you know, unless they signed up for it specifically or because everyone just swapped rooms and like hid it from the R.A.

725
00:42:25,806 --> 00:42:25,909
Speaker 0: like.

726
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,309
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but you didn't have that.

727
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,810
Speaker 1: RIT would never assign a strange guy and a strange girl to the same dorm.

728
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:36,810
Speaker 1: You either did it on purpose or you signed up for it or something, but you would have a guy's room next to a girl's room.

729
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,929
Speaker 1: You know, there wouldn't be any bathroom sharing going on.

730
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:44,570
Speaker 1: But that's how most floors were, is that to be, you know, guys and girls on the same floor.

731
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,830
Speaker 1: But RIM's dorm, Fish B, too, was guys, guys, guys in every room.

732
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:50,816
Speaker 0: Now, the other.

733
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:53,050
Speaker 0: there's a couple other things to note about Fish B, too.

734
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,509
Speaker 0: Now, I'm not going to mention names, but we had our R.A.

735
00:42:57,312 --> 00:42:59,830
Speaker 0: I will call him Eric and leave it at that.

736
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:00,848
Speaker 0: I will not give his full name.

737
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,986
Speaker 0: The man was unique.

738
00:43:05,111 --> 00:43:07,203
Speaker 0: Eric Big Shemmy's he.

739
00:43:07,223 --> 00:43:08,369
Speaker 0: he I'll put it this way.

740
00:43:09,511 --> 00:43:14,630
Speaker 0: He didn't get in my way and I didn't get in his way because I basically I was disconnected.

741
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:18,850
Speaker 0: The floor was around me, but I was not of the floor.

742
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,869
Speaker 0: The floor attempted to bring me into it.

743
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:22,570
Speaker 0: I had nothing to do with this floor.

744
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,310
Speaker 1: I just think your roommate didn't have anything to do with your floor either.

745
00:43:25,694 --> 00:43:26,490
Speaker 0: But there's something cool.

746
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:30,650
Speaker 0: There's almost this honor among thieves where crazy things happened on the floor.

747
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:37,290
Speaker 0: And a lot of the things to the outside observer would appear malicious, cruel, destructive, dangerous, horrifying.

748
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,720
Speaker 0: However, it was all.

749
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:48,150
Speaker 0: I guess there's a quote from The Simpsons to us all in good fun because they only all did it to each other and they all took it with grace.

750
00:43:48,952 --> 00:43:53,209
Speaker 0: And no one dished out anything that he did not expect to receive threefold in return.

751
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:57,950
Speaker 0: But no one ever did anything to me because I never did anything to anyone.

752
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:06,087
Speaker 0: I simply lived within these people, observe their culture like an anthropologist and one time woke up, Dr.

753
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,130
Speaker 1: Remington, I presume to eight.

754
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:13,210
Speaker 0: I opened my dorm room door on a Sunday morning to go out and get the Sunday brunch as I off did.

755
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,989
Speaker 0: Me and Greg would often go down and eat fried eggs until we were too full to eat more fried eggs.

756
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:22,209
Speaker 0: Wait any more hungry that you are.

757
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:27,430
Speaker 0: And I opened my dorm room door and a drunk person kind of collapses into the room.

758
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:28,650
Speaker 0: He's been, he's sleep.

759
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:32,170
Speaker 0: He was sleeping against my door and your door opened inwards.

760
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,329
Speaker 0: My door opened inward and he collapsed into my room, still asleep.

761
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,709
Speaker 0: He had written on the whiteboard on my door.

762
00:44:38,231 --> 00:44:38,790
Speaker 0: Let me in.

763
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:40,709
Speaker 1: Is this your roommate?

764
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,208
Speaker 0: No, it was the dude who lived in the room next to me.

765
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:47,050
Speaker 0: I don't know if he was confused or bored.

766
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:51,129
Speaker 0: I don't know if he thought let me in was somehow going to convince me to let him in.

767
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:56,650
Speaker 0: I kind of pushed him into the hallway and locked the door behind me and I wrote no on the whiteboard.

768
00:44:58,774 --> 00:44:59,384
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

769
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:06,310
Speaker 0: But Fishby too was connected to a building that had an elevator, but itself did not have an elevator.

770
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,650
Speaker 0: So it was connected only on the third floor.

771
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:13,890
Speaker 0: So basically there was no way in the world for a wheelchair to get to the second floor.

772
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,490
Speaker 0: Yet we had a wheelchair accessible bathroom.

773
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,690
Speaker 1: There was a way, just a very difficult way of lifting the wheelchair.

774
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:25,970
Speaker 0: Now after about a week, we had a, you see there were floor meetings as I'm sure all college kids are familiar with.

775
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:31,770
Speaker 0: But I skipped all of them when I realized right away that there were no possible repercussions.

776
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,190
Speaker 0: What, they weren't going to kick me out of the dorm.

777
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:40,722
Speaker 0: So once I realized that, I didn't go to the dorm meetings and Eric would always come and say, "Hey, you didn't go to the dorm meeting.

778
00:45:40,742 --> 00:45:41,065
Speaker 0: You know, they're

779
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:41,610
Speaker 0: mandatory.".

780
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:42,859
Speaker 0: And I said, "Yeah, I know.

781
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:43,624
Speaker 0: I'll go to the next one.

782
00:45:43,664 --> 00:45:43,785
Speaker 0: I'm

783
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,168
Speaker 0: sorry.".

784
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,790
Speaker 0: But I didn't go to the next one and he'd say the same thing and I'd say the same thing.

785
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:51,970
Speaker 0: And I got through the entirety of RIT's freshman year never going to these stupid floor meetings.

786
00:45:52,934 --> 00:45:53,829
Speaker 0: I heard tell of them.

787
00:45:54,151 --> 00:46:02,950
Speaker 0: There was one where we were, apparently the floor was admonished for the fact that both bathrooms had been completely filled with vomit, apparently at one point.

788
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,330
Speaker 0: As in every sink was clogged with vomit and no one would fess up.

789
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,290
Speaker 1: The drunkenest floor in the college.

790
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,269
Speaker 0: No one would fess up and apparently the cleaning lady quit because of it.

791
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:13,049
Speaker 1: Awesome.

792
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,463
Speaker 0: And they didn't know what to do and they...

793
00:46:15,253 --> 00:46:16,110
Speaker 1: Hire a new cleaning lady.

794
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:26,107
Speaker 0: Apparently the argument from the floor was, "Well, you can either kick us all out or you can deny us the use of the bathrooms.

795
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:27,689
Speaker 0: I don't think either will end

796
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:28,010
Speaker 0: well.".

797
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could have vomited elsewhere.

798
00:46:31,295 --> 00:46:32,590
Speaker 0: I had nothing to do with these people.

799
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:41,390
Speaker 0: But the floor had kind of... See, I went to the secret meetings where the whole floor would get together and kind of have this rule of manly law.

800
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:46,268
Speaker 0: And everyone got together and decided that, "Here shall be the rules of the

801
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:46,850
Speaker 0: bathrooms.".

802
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:53,370
Speaker 0: Because the other interesting point of Fish B2 was that there was a woman's bathroom, but there were no women.

803
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,289
Speaker 1: And there was a handicapped bathroom, but no handicapped people.

804
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,729
Speaker 0: So we had to decide what to do.

805
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:05,167
Speaker 0: And one proposal was, "Leave the women's bathroom for women under the auspices that women would come to our

806
00:47:05,228 --> 00:47:05,549
Speaker 0: floor.".

807
00:47:06,587 --> 00:47:06,670
Speaker 0: Oh.

808
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:09,902
Speaker 0: The argument put forth in counter to that was that, "Ha!

809
00:47:10,224 --> 00:47:10,485
Speaker 0: Fat

810
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:10,867
Speaker 0: chance!".

811
00:47:12,091 --> 00:47:23,949
Speaker 0: And thus the agreement was such, "The handicapped bathroom shall be for women who visit, and people who are in need of privacy for matters that will be understood to be agreed upon by

812
00:47:24,169 --> 00:47:24,229
Speaker 0: all.".

813
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:26,470
Speaker 0: Basically masturbation.

814
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,730
Speaker 1: Or women who visit.

815
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:30,234
Speaker 0: Yes.

816
00:47:30,254 --> 00:47:33,570
Speaker 0: Or someone who needs a private place, perhaps with a woman.

817
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:39,170
Speaker 0: So that bathroom, let me tell you, was meticulously clean and there was a chair in there.

818
00:47:40,355 --> 00:47:41,470
Speaker 0: It was rather large, actually.

819
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:46,790
Speaker 0: Actually, it was a full quarter the size of a dorm room, but I don't want to get into that.

820
00:47:47,713 --> 00:47:49,148
Speaker 0: One guy moved into it for a little while.

821
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:50,935
Speaker 1: Okay.

822
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:52,610
Speaker 1: Weren't you taking your showers in there?

823
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,668
Speaker 0: I took my showers in there for the longest time.

824
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,916
Speaker 0: But, henceforth, the bathroom signs were replaced with the... We made signs.

825
00:48:01,057 --> 00:48:02,466
Speaker 0: One said, "Pisser

826
00:48:02,526 --> 00:48:02,848
Speaker 0: Shitter.".

827
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:04,494
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

828
00:48:04,534 --> 00:48:05,219
Speaker 0: It said, "Pisser

829
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:06,085
Speaker 0: Shower-er.".

830
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:06,690
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

831
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:10,507
Speaker 0: And the second one said, "Pooper Vomiter," or "Shitter

832
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:10,990
Speaker 0: Vomiter."

833
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:11,231
Speaker 0: Exactly.

834
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:13,805
Speaker 1: The men's bathroom was the "Pisser

835
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:14,589
Speaker 1: Shower-er.".

836
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:18,070
Speaker 1: So if you had to urinate or shower, you would go in there.

837
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:18,870
Speaker 1: But there was a rule.

838
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:21,650
Speaker 1: If you had to shit or vomit, you would go in the women's bathroom.

839
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,889
Speaker 0: If you chose to poop in that bathroom, you were allowed to.

840
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:33,148
Speaker 0: But if there was any trace, any evidence that you had pooped in there, you have committed a crime against the floor, we didn't ever decide what the punishment would be, but...

841
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:36,250
Speaker 1: Well, obviously retaliation threefold in kind.

842
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:37,570
Speaker 0: A retaliatory pooping?

843
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:38,213
Speaker 1: Yes.

844
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:39,810
Speaker 1: Threefold pooping.

845
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:46,070
Speaker 0: Despite all the antics, no one ever pooped in a way that was noticeable in that bathroom.

846
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,405
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it was the "Pisser

847
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:48,809
Speaker 1: Shower-er."

848
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,030
Speaker 1: And everyone showered in that one.

849
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:53,310
Speaker 1: Even an animal knows not to, you know, shit in its shower.

850
00:48:54,872 --> 00:48:59,410
Speaker 0: And then the other one, basically one bathroom was for nasty stuff and one was for slightly less nasty stuff.

851
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:03,070
Speaker 0: And of course, if all the showers were full, well, people would shower in the other one.

852
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,170
Speaker 0: It was basically, if you can, use the nice bathroom for nice things.

853
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,430
Speaker 0: If you can't, use the un-nice bathroom for nice things.

854
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:13,750
Speaker 0: But woe betide he who does un-nice things in the nice bathroom.

855
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:22,789
Speaker 0: And it worked real well, because I gotta tell ya, all the stories I heard from everyone else in the dorms was that they could never take a shower because they were always full.

856
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,446
Speaker 0: Because, of course, everyone's first class was at 10 AM.

857
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:36,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, I actually lived on "Peterson 3," which does not fish B2.

858
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,548
Speaker 0: I spent most of my time on "Peterson

859
00:49:38,548 --> 00:49:38,790
Speaker 0: 3.".

860
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:41,390
Speaker 0: In fact, I slept in their lounge more than once.

861
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:47,249
Speaker 1: It was an un-renovated dorm, one of the last un-renovated dorms there, which meant the rooms were bigger.

862
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:51,270
Speaker 1: There was no communal bathroom that had many, many shower stalls.

863
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:54,390
Speaker 1: We had one bathroom for two dorm rooms.

864
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,030
Speaker 1: We had one shower in there.

865
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,670
Speaker 1: I think there might actually have been two showers in there.

866
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,129
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

867
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,690
Speaker 1: There was basically a shower, a toilet, and two sinks in there.

868
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:02,980
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

869
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,187
Speaker 1: It was almost a private bathroom.

870
00:50:06,288 --> 00:50:06,550
Speaker 1: Almost.

871
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:09,348
Speaker 1: It was a beautiful thing to live in "Peterson

872
00:50:09,348 --> 00:50:09,570
Speaker 1: 3.".

873
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,209
Speaker 1: "Peterson 3" was the "no drugs" floor.

874
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:17,670
Speaker 1: The complete opposite of fish B2, where there was vomiting and whatnot.

875
00:50:18,111 --> 00:50:20,070
Speaker 0: It was called the "substance-free" floor.

876
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,428
Speaker 0: It wasn't just like, "Yeah, we won't drink on the

877
00:50:22,448 --> 00:50:22,650
Speaker 0: floor.".

878
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:28,705
Speaker 0: It was like, "All right, we know everyone's doing drugs and smoking pot, but don't do it in this

879
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:29,169
Speaker 0: floor.".

880
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:39,570
Speaker 1: And not only that, but if you are drunk, and you return to the floor, that is a very bad idea, and you can actually get in serious shit.

881
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:40,905
Speaker 1: So basically...

882
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,688
Speaker 0: Well, RIT's serious shit was, "Well, you have to live somewhere else

883
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:43,869
Speaker 0: now.".

884
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:44,310
Speaker 0: Yeah.

885
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:56,006
Speaker 1: So it was awesome, because I lived on this floor of all these people who didn't want to be drunk, didn't want to get stupid, and actually just wanted to be cool and have a good time.

886
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:06,289
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing is RIT is also home to the NTID, National Technical Institute for the Deaf, but half the people on the floor were deaf and half were not.

887
00:51:07,451 --> 00:51:12,866
Speaker 1: So it was actually pretty cool, you know, half the people were just like, you know, they were deaf, and they were all like, "What's

888
00:51:12,948 --> 00:51:13,009
Speaker 1: up?".

889
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,270
Speaker 1: Because they were the cool deaf people, not the drunken deaf people.

890
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:20,570
Speaker 0: Now, the thing is, the substance-free thing, whatever, I didn't care about that.

891
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:31,908
Speaker 0: I mean, I kept wine in my room, and actually I left a very large red stain as a bottle of red wine exploded in my crappy little mini-fridge, because apparently it got set too cold and froze the thing.

892
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:44,330
Speaker 0: And my stupid roommate, who I never interacted with, I remember I got back, and there's this giant red stain on the floor, and he says, "Yeah, I heard a noise from your fridge, and that stuff started leaking out.

893
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:49,298
Speaker 0: I figured I'd leave it for, I didn't want to intrude upon your space or anything, so I didn't do

894
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:49,684
Speaker 0: anything.".

895
00:51:50,852 --> 00:51:51,677
Speaker 0: I was like, "Thanks, dude.

896
00:51:51,697 --> 00:51:52,583
Speaker 0: That was

897
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:52,865
Speaker 0: great.".

898
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:54,628
Speaker 1: The winner is you.

899
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:56,041
Speaker 0: I didn't have to pay.

900
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:57,789
Speaker 0: I don't know why, but I never got billed for that.

901
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, my roommate was similar.

902
00:51:59,592 --> 00:52:08,610
Speaker 1: He was a guy who was really interested in soccer, and I don't think he made the RIT soccer team, but he was always watching European soccer and stuff like that.

903
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,146
Speaker 1: You're a geek about something.

904
00:52:11,207 --> 00:52:11,650
Speaker 1: It's all good.

905
00:52:12,998 --> 00:52:13,550
Speaker 1: We got along.

906
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,449
Speaker 1: We didn't fight or anything.

907
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:19,230
Speaker 1: We both did our thing, and I think I got him to play a geeky card game once.

908
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,830
Speaker 1: I think he played guillotine once or something.

909
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:25,443
Speaker 1: But other than that, we didn't interact too much, and it was just all good.

910
00:52:25,605 --> 00:52:25,930
Speaker 1: Whatever.

911
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,029
Speaker 0: Mine was a little weird step beyond that.

912
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:30,069
Speaker 0: I don't even remember the guy's name.

913
00:52:30,431 --> 00:52:34,390
Speaker 0: We introduced each other, and our parents were there, and they talked to each other like, "Oh, what a nice young boy.

914
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:35,256
Speaker 0: Oh, what a nice young boy.

915
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:36,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, they get along just

916
00:52:36,063 --> 00:52:36,325
Speaker 0: fine.".

917
00:52:37,051 --> 00:52:42,010
Speaker 0: And the only time we interacted... Well, we interacted three times in the entirety of the time.

918
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:42,686
Speaker 1: The tribes do.

919
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,969
Speaker 0: Well, I guess four times.

920
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,641
Speaker 0: So time the one.

921
00:52:47,884 --> 00:52:48,349
Speaker 0: We moved in.

922
00:52:48,491 --> 00:52:51,338
Speaker 0: We set everything up, and we realized that the dorms were so small.

923
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:52,569
Speaker 0: We had one of the narrow dorms.

924
00:52:53,072 --> 00:52:54,000
Speaker 1: The renovated dorms.

925
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, the big dorm.

926
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:55,889
Speaker 1: Pre-renovation.

927
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,126
Speaker 1: Nothing was new and fancy.

928
00:52:58,146 --> 00:53:00,890
Speaker 1: It was a little scuzzy and old, but it was bigger and better.

929
00:53:01,092 --> 00:53:01,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

930
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:06,809
Speaker 0: But we realized that we could not both sit at our desks at the same time.

931
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,809
Speaker 0: So we skewed everything to make sure that worked, and we had to talk while we moved the furniture around.

932
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:16,189
Speaker 0: And then when the wine exploded, I talked to him.

933
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:26,210
Speaker 0: When I jumped out of my bunk bed and landed on the floor and kind of hurt myself that one time, which I've told that story before, he asked me if I was alright.

934
00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:30,283
Speaker 0: And then there was the time when we moved out, and I said, "Well, see

935
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:30,485
Speaker 0: ya.".

936
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:34,465
Speaker 0: And then he left, and then I lived in the dorm for four more days by myself.

937
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:35,010
Speaker 0: It was great.

938
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:35,603
Speaker 1: Yeah.

939
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:42,081
Speaker 1: The dorm, the size of the dorm I lived in, if it had been anywhere else, would have had three people in it, but it only had two.

940
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:43,354
Speaker 1: It was wonderful.

941
00:53:43,495 --> 00:53:50,649
Speaker 0: You could fit four of the RIT narrow dorms in the living room of our house with room to spare.

942
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:51,494
Speaker 1: Easily.

943
00:53:51,514 --> 00:53:54,227
Speaker 0: And two people lived in each of these things.

944
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,658
Speaker 0: They were not large.

945
00:53:57,794 --> 00:54:04,530
Speaker 1: No, and that is why the furniture is such that, you know, the bed goes above the desk, and the closet is sort of built in there.

946
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:21,558
Speaker 0: But it was funny, the kind of honor among, like, the expected protocols that everyone, everyone, every guy hosted their class schedule, kind of like, not like publicly like, "Here's my class schedule," but everyone always put it out so that the roommate could, with very little snooping, kind of just look at it.

947
00:54:22,268 --> 00:54:30,010
Speaker 0: And for anyone who hasn't been to college yet, this is for no purpose other than to determine the masturbatory schedule.

948
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:37,013
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's nothing worse than, you know, getting your groove on and then- And hearing that jingle, jingle, jingle.

949
00:54:37,155 --> 00:54:39,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, hearing the jingle of keys getting ready to open the door.

950
00:54:39,906 --> 00:54:49,297
Speaker 0: However, every time you return home to your dorm room, and you're supposed to be at class, you always took some extra time jiggling the door, just, you know, just in case.

951
00:54:49,338 --> 00:54:59,500
Speaker 0: Give the person some time, because you know what they're doing, and when you walk in, they know that you know, but there's kind of this unspoken, well, it's not even kind of, it was unspoken.

952
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,814
Speaker 0: No one ever made reference to it.

953
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:03,136
Speaker 1: Nope, no one ever said anything.

954
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,358
Speaker 0: But it's weird how everyone kind of just did it.

955
00:55:05,378 --> 00:55:06,935
Speaker 1: I actually had a close call once.

956
00:55:06,955 --> 00:55:10,895
Speaker 0: I had a couple close calls, because my man liked to skip class.

957
00:55:11,723 --> 00:55:12,955
Speaker 1: Who didn't like to skip class?

958
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:18,309
Speaker 0: I skipped class a lot more than him, but somehow he always skipped, like, when I was in there masturbating.

959
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:19,709
Speaker 1: All right.

960
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:29,770
Speaker 0: But I hung out in Scott's dorm, and eventually, actually Peterson 3 became the hangout of the front row crew.

961
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:37,425
Speaker 1: Well, also, because remember, every dorm has a lounge, and lounge is key, because some people are the kind of people who use the lounges, and some people are not, right?

962
00:55:37,465 --> 00:55:39,710
Speaker 1: And the lounge is sort of a first come, first serve thing.

963
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:45,204
Speaker 1: It's like, if your group of friends is in there, everyone else has got to find somewhere else to go.

964
00:55:45,224 --> 00:55:50,390
Speaker 0: And no one ever came in and kicked people out, but it was just the people in there were made so uncomfortable.

965
00:55:50,852 --> 00:55:51,340
Speaker 0: Right.

966
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:58,435
Speaker 1: You could come in and use the microwave if someone else was hanging out in there, but you couldn't bring your friends to hang out if someone else's friends were hanging out.

967
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:04,495
Speaker 1: You didn't know each other, you know, unless you wanted to, you know, sort of get in on whatever their activity was, which happened, I guess, a couple times.

968
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:07,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how many people joined the front row crew.

969
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:14,534
Speaker 1: But you don't come in and try to have your activity side by side with someone else's existing activity, and you don't come in and try to display someone's activity.

970
00:56:14,574 --> 00:56:19,590
Speaker 1: You either come in and join the existing lounge activity or you don't go in the lounge.

971
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:26,050
Speaker 0: But it was like this force of will where whichever group had the stronger force of will just laid claim and no one ever questioned it.

972
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,102
Speaker 0: There was never an argument.

973
00:56:27,162 --> 00:56:29,301
Speaker 0: No one ever said, "Hey, can we use the lounge?

974
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:30,189
Speaker 0: Hey, blah, blah, blah.

975
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:31,140
Speaker 0: Hey, you guys are

976
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:31,424
Speaker 0: loud.".

977
00:56:31,464 --> 00:56:35,369
Speaker 0: It was just one group remain- two groups enter, one group remains.

978
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:41,909
Speaker 0: But Peterson 3 became the hangout primarily because there was this thing in the corner of the room.

979
00:56:42,492 --> 00:56:45,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, the lounge, you know, was old, so it was bigger, right?

980
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:51,089
Speaker 1: It had a TV just like every other lounge, right, with a VCR and cable, you know, provided by the school.

981
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:58,982
Speaker 1: But in the corner of the room, right, because it was like the way the building was, there was a storage closet next to the lounge.

982
00:56:59,446 --> 00:57:03,770
Speaker 1: So in the corner of the lounge, there was like this weird terraced block.

983
00:57:04,012 --> 00:57:06,030
Speaker 1: It was like three steps and then a landing.

984
00:57:06,614 --> 00:57:07,687
Speaker 0: I think there was like a pipe.

985
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:08,678
Speaker 0: There was something under it.

986
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:09,850
Speaker 1: There had to be something under it.

987
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:17,061
Speaker 1: I think it might have been the storage closet or who knows what was under there, but there was just like this little terraced step in the corner of the room.

988
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:18,050
Speaker 0: It was pretty tall, too.

989
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,350
Speaker 0: It was like four and a half feet tall.

990
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:24,496
Speaker 1: You could, you know, it was sort of like, "Hey, we could like have the DM sit up there.

991
00:57:24,516 --> 00:57:24,678
Speaker 1: It'd be

992
00:57:24,718 --> 00:57:24,900
Speaker 1: cool.".

993
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:32,558
Speaker 0: Basically, the Dungeon Master sat up there, and it's weird, when we weren't playing D&D, no one sat there.

994
00:57:33,246 --> 00:57:35,808
Speaker 0: Like, if you or I guess if you were telling a story sometimes, you'd sit there.

995
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:39,364
Speaker 1: If you ran out of room in the room and you're out of places to sit, some people would go up there.

996
00:57:39,445 --> 00:57:39,910
Speaker 0: But rarely.

997
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:52,555
Speaker 0: Usually, the only time someone was there is if they had, for whatever reason, either playing D&D or telling a story or whatever, if they were kind of the master of ceremonies, they had the control of the zeitgeist of the room at the moment.

998
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:55,007
Speaker 0: It was kind of like the speaker's podium or the soapbox.

999
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,314
Speaker 1: Oftentimes, we'd put the little TV there.

1000
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:02,940
Speaker 0: Yes, we would, because the little TV, when we were using it, had control of the room.

1001
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, because remember, there was a VCR, I think, in the lounge, or wasn't there?

1002
00:58:07,344 --> 00:58:10,233
Speaker 0: No, there wasn't, but I brought a VCR with me.

1003
00:58:10,274 --> 00:58:11,061
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.

1004
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:12,455
Speaker 1: I said the lounge had a VCR.

1005
00:58:12,516 --> 00:58:13,162
Speaker 1: Actually, I was wrong.

1006
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:13,768
Speaker 1: It did not.

1007
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:24,938
Speaker 1: So, we would bring a VCR sometimes, but if we didn't, my roommate had brought a tiny TV with built-in VCR and we'd carry it to the lounge and watch things on this incredibly tiny television.

1008
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:26,190
Speaker 0: It was great.

1009
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:28,517
Speaker 1: Mostly anime from the Anime Club library on VHS.

1010
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:29,670
Speaker 0: Oh my God, those were good days.

1011
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,536
Speaker 0: We were pretty much our schedule on an average day.

1012
00:58:32,556 --> 00:58:34,980
Speaker 1: That was also the last time I had cables and I lived in those dorms.

1013
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:37,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we'd show up, you know, we'd wake up.

1014
00:58:37,526 --> 00:58:43,080
Speaker 1: I paid for that cable, half of it, every freaking quarter, but I never used it and the other guy only used it to watch Italian soccer.

1015
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:47,429
Speaker 0: We'd wake up and we'd, like, on a given day that wasn't a club night or something, we'd all go to class

1016
00:58:48,272 --> 00:58:48,495
Speaker 1: and then

1017
00:58:48,535 --> 00:58:56,414
Speaker 0: we'd all, like, do our thing and we might see each other for lunch or whatever, front row crew, all this business, and then, you know, a few of us worked, but most of us didn't have jobs.

1018
00:58:56,475 --> 00:58:59,465
Speaker 0: We just had no money and no jobs and didn't care, and then we'd

1019
00:58:59,566 --> 00:59:00,515
Speaker 1: all kind of

1020
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:01,969
Speaker 0: converge on

1021
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:03,770
Speaker 1: Gracie's around

1022
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:17,244
Speaker 0: like six o'clock, six thirty, seven, and the time would slowly shift, but the whole front row crew and, like, all the kind of attached crews, because that was kind of the peak of our crew before the front row crew kind of fully distilled out

1023
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:17,426
Speaker 1: of it.

1024
00:59:17,446 --> 00:59:18,961
Speaker 1: Before we distilled and condensed.

1025
00:59:19,426 --> 00:59:24,961
Speaker 0: There were a good twenty to thirty people at the absolute peak who would kind of congregate around the front row crew.

1026
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:26,981
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what happened to a lot of those people.

1027
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:35,184
Speaker 0: Well, it was kind of like the front row crew was the core and there was this large, like, tertiary group around it that would follow us.

1028
00:59:35,507 --> 00:59:41,144
Speaker 0: Like, wherever we gathered, like, all those other people would kind of gather around us, but we were always there.

1029
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:44,538
Speaker 0: We always got wherever we were going first and left last.

1030
00:59:44,921 --> 00:59:45,688
Speaker 0: It was kind of weird.

1031
00:59:45,709 --> 01:00:03,149
Speaker 0: Like, we'd all go to the quad and hang out on The Thing, which was the common pastime outside when it wasn't, you know, as cold, and then that group would kind of find out we were there and converge around us and we'd all hang out, and then it'd all eventually leave, and then it'd be back to the core group again for another couple hours.

1032
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:07,686
Speaker 0: But we'd all go to Gracie's, which we could do a whole show on.

1033
01:00:07,726 --> 01:00:09,687
Speaker 0: Gracie's in and of itself, I think, but...

1034
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:10,657
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

1035
01:00:10,698 --> 01:00:11,506
Speaker 1: It's a cafeteria.

1036
01:00:11,546 --> 01:00:12,496
Speaker 1: How much is there to say?

1037
01:00:12,718 --> 01:00:13,283
Speaker 0: A lot of things.

1038
01:00:13,303 --> 01:00:14,920
Speaker 0: Remember when that dude stole my hat?

1039
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:15,830
Speaker 1: Alright.

1040
01:00:16,591 --> 01:00:17,363
Speaker 1: The dude stole your hat.

1041
01:00:17,384 --> 01:00:17,749
Speaker 1: The end.

1042
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:19,647
Speaker 0: Remember Steve Towell?

1043
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,670
Speaker 0: The, uh, the spectacle?

1044
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:23,770
Speaker 0: I don't know if you were there for the spectacle.

1045
01:00:24,431 --> 01:00:24,795
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1046
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:28,879
Speaker 0: The spectacle, if you don't remember the spectacle, you weren't there.

1047
01:00:29,283 --> 01:00:50,674
Speaker 0: But, uh, we would go there, we'd all eat, and then we'd kind of wait for the people we didn't want to hang out with to give up and leave, and then we'd all go to Peterson 3, hang out until, like, 1150, and then, oh shit, the core's closing, and we'd run down to the corner store, Scott and I would buy Red Baron's Four Cheese Pizza, and everyone else had their own kind of ritualistic food.

1048
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:54,556
Speaker 0: We'd go back, we'd all microwave our various ritualistic foods.

1049
01:00:54,678 --> 01:00:55,230
Speaker 1: I'm real hungry.

1050
01:00:55,914 --> 01:01:02,709
Speaker 0: We'd eat them, and then we'd hang out until about 1.32, 3 in the morning, and then we'd all go to bed and skip our next, you know, day's classes.

1051
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:17,713
Speaker 0: Man, I really suddenly have all this nostalgia for hanging out in Peterson 3, but eventually, there was this whole shuffle where some of our friends like Alex and Pete had to move dorms because they were renovating dorms in the course of school.

1052
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,704
Speaker 0: So they eventually moved into the new dorm, the new tower, Sol 8.

1053
01:01:22,704 --> 01:01:34,724
Speaker 0: And we kind of replaced Peterson 3 with Sol 8 because the lounge there, while it didn't have the thing, was a lot bigger, had a better TV, had better couches, the microwave worked a lot better, and it didn't smell funny.

1054
01:01:34,764 --> 01:01:39,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, we usually did, you know, anime marathons there, because that was a renovated dorm.

1055
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:44,292
Speaker 0: Yep, but if we had to play D&D, we still went back to Peterson 3.

1056
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:44,579
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1057
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:55,290
Speaker 1: Actually, while we were at RIT, right, they renovated this one dorm, so actually we had people who started out living in one dorm that had to move to the one that was finished being renovated.

1058
01:01:55,651 --> 01:01:57,470
Speaker 0: Those were Pete, you know, all the people we were talking about.

1059
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were living in Ellington, which is un-renovated.

1060
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:05,269
Speaker 1: Then, they finished renovating Sol, these people from Ellington moved to Sol, then they started renovating Ellington.

1061
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,066
Speaker 0: And of course, I mean, man, we used to do a lot of it.

1062
01:02:09,086 --> 01:02:18,077
Speaker 0: Like, we used to, like, eventually we'd get bored and we'd get this wanderlust, and we'd like, wander into all the tunnels, because half the tunnels under the dorms at that time in RIT were abandoned.

1063
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:23,650
Speaker 0: Like, there was old stuff down there, like, the old nightclub that was closed, and the old arcade that was closed.

1064
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:28,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you went down to these dorms and there was, like, relics of, like, a college in the past.

1065
01:02:28,459 --> 01:02:30,461
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing that always gets me upset.

1066
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:38,279
Speaker 1: It's like, you see things that tell you, they let you know clearly that awesome was here, awesome is now gone.

1067
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:54,804
Speaker 0: There were nightclubs, bars, arcades, like, rooms we weren't even sure what they were for, stores that hadn't been open since, like, the 60s or 70s, tunnels that were cut off, fully functioning bathrooms in parts of the tunnels that didn't even have power.

1068
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:56,117
Speaker 0: Like, it was weird.

1069
01:02:56,461 --> 01:03:08,682
Speaker 1: There was, you know, because the renovations, this tunnel system under all the dorms actually was split in half for a time, and you could only get from one area to the other, and people only really went down there to do laundry, and then that was it.

1070
01:03:09,288 --> 01:03:10,863
Speaker 1: But, you know, there's the corners there.

1071
01:03:10,883 --> 01:03:11,106
Speaker 1: Well, well,

1072
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:23,510
Speaker 0: and we went down there to do laundry, but in my side, at least, because I was connected, basically, there were the tunnels that actually connected to everything, and then there were kind of the bastardized tunnels that would connect to everything, but it was cut off for the renovation.

1073
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:27,870
Speaker 0: And Peterson was connected to those, but I was connected to, I guess, the real tunnels.

1074
01:03:28,293 --> 01:03:39,490
Speaker 0: You could get between all the different dorms, except for the ones under renovation, and all the way to Gracie's, and all the way to the frat houses, and a large portion of the way to the academic side, without ever setting foot outdoors.

1075
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:40,901
Speaker 1: And this is key.

1076
01:03:41,447 --> 01:03:44,850
Speaker 1: This is very key, because Rochester is fucking cold in the winter.

1077
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:59,930
Speaker 0: You would plot out, like, exactly how far can I get before I have to step outside, and then what is the quickest way to get back inside at the other side of the buildings, where, you know, the academic side had its own set of tunnels.

1078
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:03,770
Speaker 0: And you try to get from one tunnel to the other tunnel as quickly as possible.

1079
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,289
Speaker 1: The post office is also down there.

1080
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was, and a lot of other cool stuff.

1081
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,960
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah, exploring those tunnels, man.

1082
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:12,497
Speaker 1: Well, not so much exploring.

1083
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:15,002
Speaker 1: They were really quick to explore all of them.

1084
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:16,255
Speaker 0: But we'd wander around.

1085
01:04:16,276 --> 01:04:19,909
Speaker 1: Going down there and checking stuff out and seeing what was up was good times.

1086
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:22,315
Speaker 0: And, like, we'd get bored and just kind of wander around.

1087
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:31,790
Speaker 0: I remember that one time we found, they built, like, for some reason, they made a really fancy new conference room down there, like, in the middle of effectively abandoned tunnels.

1088
01:04:32,614 --> 01:04:34,520
Speaker 0: And they left it open one day, and we found it.

1089
01:04:35,068 --> 01:04:41,287
Speaker 0: So, we rigged one of the other doors, there were two doors to this place, so it looked like it was closed and locked, but we could still get in.

1090
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:45,569
Speaker 0: And then, for a while, we would go down there to play BattleTech.

1091
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:50,596
Speaker 1: Yeah, big conference room table, tunnels, night, no one's down there.

1092
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:53,022
Speaker 1: Whiteboards, why not play BattleTech?

1093
01:04:53,103 --> 01:04:53,670
Speaker 0: It was really cool.

1094
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:59,429
Speaker 0: It was kind of like this, like, it was basically our tree fort, because we'd lock ourselves in there.

1095
01:05:00,032 --> 01:05:04,819
Speaker 0: And, you know, it was quiet outside, like, there'd never be anyone in those tunnels, except every now and then the security guy.

1096
01:05:05,304 --> 01:05:09,790
Speaker 0: But we were cut off from everyone in our own private hangout, no one knew we were there, and the door was locked.

1097
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:11,067
Speaker 0: No one could bother us.

1098
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:18,229
Speaker 0: Eventually, someone must have found the tape we'd put in the rigged door, because one day we couldn't get in anymore, and we never got into that room again.

1099
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:19,297
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1100
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:23,062
Speaker 1: But no, dorms are all about staying inside, not going outside.

1101
01:05:23,102 --> 01:05:29,930
Speaker 1: You know, you've got the wicked fast internet connection, you've got plenty of people, you've got access to food without going outside.

1102
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:33,326
Speaker 1: You don't have to worry about money or anything, right?

1103
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:38,856
Speaker 1: So, it's all about just getting everything done, doing your whole life awesome, just in a building.

1104
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:42,410
Speaker 1: It's good preparation for the arcology living of the future.

1105
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:46,837
Speaker 0: But you're so isolated, and, you know, you're all together, and you're all geeks, and you're bored.

1106
01:05:47,261 --> 01:06:00,009
Speaker 0: So as a result, I think that's part of the reason why the front row crew is so close and so family-like, is that we basically lived on a space station, isolated from all other people for long stretches of time, with nothing but other geeks around.

1107
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:04,249
Speaker 0: And, ugh, man, they were good times, let me tell you.

1108
01:06:04,633 --> 01:06:18,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's sort of why I want to make, like, a geek apartment complex or building or something like that, you know, to sort of, you know, give people who are not, you know, RIT CS students the opportunity to have that kind of living.

1109
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:40,350
Speaker 0: In the deadest dead of winter, no one had Friday classes, so Friday morning, like, we'd all get up and get, you know, lunch, well, breakfast at like one o'clock or whatever, and we would all not set foot outside until Monday when we had to go to class again, and we'd all eat at Gracie's, like, you know, breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the whole weekend, and we'd, like, marathon a bunch of anime, like, we'd watch 13 episodes of a show on Saturday.

1110
01:06:40,591 --> 01:06:51,966
Speaker 1: And you had not a care in the world, nothing else to do, nothing else to think about, nothing in the way, no real life, you know, you did your laundry, you did a little bit of homework, you know, to pass class, and then, what else did you have to do?

1111
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:52,350
Speaker 1: Nothing.

1112
01:06:52,810 --> 01:07:08,676
Speaker 0: What I really miss is that by having no other concerns, I mean, you're a freshman too, so it's not even like the future is looming, nothing's looming, so everything I did was something I wanted to do, and I wasted a lot of time, but I wasted it purposefully.

1113
01:07:08,777 --> 01:07:14,815
Speaker 0: I used to always tell people about the slacker spirit and become infused with the slacker spirit, and the slacker spirit is this.

1114
01:07:15,682 --> 01:07:22,530
Speaker 0: If you are going to dick around and waste time and just enjoy yourself, do it wholeheartedly.

1115
01:07:23,092 --> 01:07:24,815
Speaker 0: Don't worry about anything else in the world.

1116
01:07:24,936 --> 01:07:27,179
Speaker 0: If you're gonna skip class, don't worry about class.

1117
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:52,130
Speaker 0: If you're gonna waste an entire weekend, don't even think of it as wasted, just do what you wanna do, and I would watch 20 hours of anime over the course of a weekend, as in, we'd marathon a whole show, and then like on Sunday we'd watch a bunch of other anime, and play some D&D in between all those things, and not get anything done, and at no point in those 20 hours did I ever think I could be spending this time better.

1118
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:56,066
Speaker 0: In fact, at best, I would think, "Man, are these the best days of my

1119
01:07:56,107 --> 01:07:56,309
Speaker 0: life.".

1120
01:07:56,932 --> 01:08:03,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, if you cut class to play Tribes 2 and the whole time you're like, "I shouldn't have skipped that

1121
01:08:03,218 --> 01:08:03,603
Speaker 1: class.".

1122
01:08:03,623 --> 01:08:04,170
Speaker 1: You were nervous.

1123
01:08:05,051 --> 01:08:06,230
Speaker 1: You should have just gone to the class.

1124
01:08:06,856 --> 01:08:07,507
Speaker 1: You wasted it.

1125
01:08:08,412 --> 01:08:11,966
Speaker 0: The fact that nothing ever distracted me from what I was doing at RIT.

1126
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:15,520
Speaker 0: That is one thing that I had, and I don't have that anymore.

1127
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:16,590
Speaker 0: Maybe it's because I'm ambitious.

1128
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:21,970
Speaker 0: Like, even now, I'm at work, I'm working on work, but I'm also thinking about what I'm gonna do with Geek Nights.

1129
01:08:22,451 --> 01:08:23,560
Speaker 0: I'm at home, I'm doing Geek Nights.

1130
01:08:23,582 --> 01:08:25,621
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about what I'm gonna eat when I finish this show.

1131
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:33,743
Speaker 0: When I'm playing Natural Selection, I'm thinking about I'll look at the clock and think, "Well, in an hour, I should probably stop playing NS so that I can do

1132
01:08:33,763 --> 01:08:33,783
Speaker 0: X.".

1133
01:08:34,572 --> 01:08:40,130
Speaker 0: At RIT, I would skip class, I'd come home to the dorm, I'd start playing Natural Selection.

1134
01:08:40,974 --> 01:08:42,906
Speaker 0: I would stop when I was done.

1135
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:46,330
Speaker 0: I didn't even think, "When's my next

1136
01:08:46,411 --> 01:08:46,714
Speaker 0: class?".

1137
01:08:46,795 --> 01:08:47,805
Speaker 0: I thought, "I'm playing

1138
01:08:47,867 --> 01:08:48,149
Speaker 0: NS.".

1139
01:08:48,493 --> 01:08:49,804
Speaker 0: At some point, I would stop NS.

1140
01:08:50,207 --> 01:08:53,175
Speaker 0: I'd look at the clock and go, "Oh shit, it's 8 o'clock.

1141
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:54,363
Speaker 0: Fuck.".

1142
01:08:55,553 --> 01:08:57,886
Speaker 0: And then I'd say, "Well, I already missed class, better go get

1143
01:08:57,907 --> 01:08:58,050
Speaker 0: dinner.".

1144
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,569
Speaker 1: -I don't think we were playing NS when we were in the dorms.

1145
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:01,296
Speaker 1: It wasn't out yet.

1146
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:02,470
Speaker 0: -Might not have been, I don't remember.

1147
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:03,801
Speaker 1: -It wasn't until we were living in the apartment.

1148
01:09:03,823 --> 01:09:05,317
Speaker 0: -We were, however, playing tribes.

1149
01:09:05,337 --> 01:09:06,488
Speaker 1: -We were playing tribes, too.

1150
01:09:06,729 --> 01:09:08,290
Speaker 0: -But I did the same thing in the apartment.

1151
01:09:08,852 --> 01:09:10,085
Speaker 0: That's not a dorm-only thing.

1152
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:11,520
Speaker 0: That was a RIT thing.

1153
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,640
Speaker 1: -Well, I think it's an A college thing.

1154
01:09:13,662 --> 01:09:14,430
Speaker 0: -Yeah, well, it depends.

1155
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:15,337
Speaker 1: -Can I eat now?

1156
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,953
Speaker 0: -Oh, you wanna stop doing the show?

1157
01:09:16,974 --> 01:09:17,742
Speaker 1: -I'm just hungry.

1158
01:09:17,761 --> 01:09:22,249
Speaker 0: -Alright, I'll tell you this, 'cause we have a lot of anecdotes about RIT in the dorms, and I just wanna hear this.

1159
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:32,750
Speaker 0: All of you out there, you GeekKnives listeners, do you want more, maybe a better-produced episode, as opposed to this kind of, "Ah, we're tired and we're kinda just winging the episode,".

1160
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:35,357
Speaker 0: but do you wanna hear more anecdotes from RIT?

1161
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,490
Speaker 0: Because we got a lot.

1162
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:50,270
Speaker 1: -People seem to just love anecdotes shows, but I feel like we should have more substance in it, and yet again, much like someone who, you know, "Ah, you know, is thinking about what they should've gone to class while they were skipping it," right?

1163
01:09:51,212 --> 01:09:53,801
Speaker 1: I am thinking, "Ah, we should do a show with substance while we're doing a crab people

1164
01:09:53,821 --> 01:09:53,902
Speaker 1: show.".

1165
01:09:53,921 --> 01:10:02,444
Speaker 0: -Of course, at the same time, I'm kinda tired this week, but that's just an unrelated thing, so I'm just waiting for the show to be done, 'cause then all I have to do is FNPL tomorrow, and then, uh...

1166
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:07,638
Speaker 1: -Yeah, it's weird, Thursday is our most flexible day, yet it's the hardest day to actually come up with what to do the show on.

1167
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:13,901
Speaker 1: Maybe we should just do a lot more, maybe we should just do a lot, I'm reading a lot of books, maybe we should just turn Thursday into book day.

1168
01:10:14,224 --> 01:10:15,074
Speaker 1: Maybe that'll get people to read.

1169
01:10:15,094 --> 01:10:16,250
Speaker 0: -No, because no one seems to read the books.

1170
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,450
Speaker 1: -Maybe if we just kept doing it, people would fuckin' read.

1171
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:29,543
Speaker 0: -But I feel like, I don't know, maybe, would you guys like it if we just did a Thursday that was just, like, we'll turn into a series, we won't do it all the time, we'll do it sparingly, I don't wanna waste it, kinda like those zombie shows.

1172
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:32,510
Speaker 1: -I don't know, I think we already told most of the anecdotes we got.

1173
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,763
Speaker 0: -I haven't by far.

1174
01:10:33,783 --> 01:10:35,279
Speaker 1: -What do you gotta talk about?

1175
01:10:35,299 --> 01:10:36,289
Speaker 0: -I got a lot to say.

1176
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,569
Speaker 0: Chris, I've always been more of the anecdote-tician than you.

1177
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:46,410
Speaker 1: -I don't know, what anecdote do I have that I haven't already used, you know, only so many things happened that were memorable.

1178
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:58,590
Speaker 1: I mean, some of them were perhaps memorable, but there's really, you know, it's what, it's sort of those, you can't really tell a story about it, it's a "had to be there" thing, you know, it's like, "Hey, remember that time we sat there and watched Ava

1179
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,036
Speaker 1: straight?".

1180
01:10:59,300 --> 01:10:59,989
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, we did.

1181
01:11:00,871 --> 01:11:01,134
Speaker 1: Okay.

1182
01:11:01,579 --> 01:11:02,529
Speaker 1: What else is there to say about it?

1183
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:04,750
Speaker 0: -I guess you just don't have the gift of the storyteller.

1184
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:08,450
Speaker 1: -Dude, I can tell a great story, that has to be a story to tell.

1185
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,734
Speaker 1: It's unlike you, I don't make up stuff.

1186
01:11:10,754 --> 01:11:13,509
Speaker 0: -Except I don't have to make anything up when I'm talking about RIT.

1187
01:11:14,494 --> 01:11:15,410
Speaker 0: God, I have hours.

1188
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:25,016
Speaker 0: More happened in terms of just memorable events in the few years at RIT than have happened in many other periods of my life.

1189
01:11:25,036 --> 01:11:30,570
Speaker 1: -Yeah, there was a lot that happened but I can't, you know, there's not that much of it that it can be a whole series of shows.

1190
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:35,239
Speaker 1: We've already used a lot of it in the early shows of Geek Nights that many people haven't listened to.

1191
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:39,136
Speaker 0: -Yeah, and we could probably just tell them again, better and more experienced podcasters that we are.

1192
01:11:39,156 --> 01:11:43,609
Speaker 1: -I think we could tell them again better podcast wise but less memory wise.

1193
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:45,743
Speaker 0: -I don't seem to have this problem.

1194
01:11:45,763 --> 01:11:47,925
Speaker 1: -It was three years ago, the Geek Nights.

1195
01:11:47,945 --> 01:11:49,670
Speaker 1: -Anyway -And we talked about that shit.

1196
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,210
Speaker 0: -Okay, I don't know, what do you guys want?

1197
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:57,950
Speaker 0: Because I feel like what we could do is -You don't need to ask the people, the people always say yes, anecdotes.

1198
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:00,290
Speaker 1: They just want all anecdotes all the time.

1199
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:04,066
Speaker 0: -I want to hear it from them because I'm willing to put forth at least a token effort here.

1200
01:12:04,106 --> 01:12:08,309
Speaker 0: Basically we said we're going to change up the Thursday format and we really haven't yet.

1201
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,298
Speaker 1: -No, we failed.

1202
01:12:09,318 --> 01:12:13,802
Speaker 0: -But I feel like every Thursday we should just do something weird in story time or whatever.

1203
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:21,317
Speaker 0: but I feel like we could do a short series of vignettes just about you know, what it was like to be us at RIT.

1204
01:12:21,357 --> 01:12:29,541
Speaker 0: Not the how to not sucks where we try to kind of tell a story about us or someone we knew and then try to use it as a parable for life.

1205
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:30,470
Speaker 0: Or not.

1206
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:33,459
Speaker 0: the kind of here is how to succeed or any of those things.

1207
01:12:33,499 --> 01:12:42,088
Speaker 0: Just vignettes of what it was like very directly to be us, the front row crew, in college at RIT.

1208
01:12:44,655 --> 01:12:46,632
Speaker 0: If you don't want to do it, maybe I'll do it on my own.

1209
01:12:46,976 --> 01:12:47,885
Speaker 1: I feel like I can do this.

1210
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:57,885
Speaker 1: -I feel like we've already communicated that pretty thoroughly and I don't have, you know, it's definitely something that is people want to hear and some, you know, but I feel like we've done it already.

1211
01:12:57,926 --> 01:13:00,592
Speaker 1: It's like it's already been done and you're proposing doing it.

1212
01:13:00,612 --> 01:13:08,530
Speaker 0: -No, because part of it is that yeah, it has been done but it's diffuse throughout hundreds and hundreds of episodes of Geek Nights and this would be kind of a consolidation.

1213
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:12,370
Speaker 1: -So maybe the solution is to go back collect the material and edit it together.

1214
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:21,218
Speaker 0: -No, that's a terrible idea because usually all the material is told in the context of something else and also there's no way in hell I would have the time.

1215
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:26,108
Speaker 1: -No, no, I mean just like you know, take all the episodes and just say these are the episodes to listen to.

1216
01:13:26,169 --> 01:13:26,735
Speaker 1: that have, you know.

1217
01:13:26,755 --> 01:13:28,010
Speaker 0: -That's also a terrible idea.

1218
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:37,259
Speaker 0: A better idea would be to take all the vignettes and retell them in kind of some sort of narrative even if it's a loose narrative and have a separate show.

1219
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:44,190
Speaker 0: You've done the pre-work and the research by telling the anecdotes diffuse throughout all these shows and you consolidate them and make a separate show.

1220
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:45,788
Speaker 0: that is Life at RIT.

1221
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,635
Speaker 1: -Eh, maybe.

1222
01:13:48,918 --> 01:13:50,050
Speaker 1: Doesn't excite me that much.

1223
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:58,470
Speaker 0: -It excites me a lot to the point that I'll probably, I'll probably do that and have it done long before I do any of the other things I've been promising I'll do for Geek Nights.

1224
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:02,170
Speaker 1: -I'm working on websites and things slowly but surely.

1225
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,741
Speaker 0: -Anyway, let's eat some food and go to bed.

1226
01:14:03,762 --> 01:14:04,550
Speaker 1: -Oh god food.

1227
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:13,233
Speaker 0: -This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1228
