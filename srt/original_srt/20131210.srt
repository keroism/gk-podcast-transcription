1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,701
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, December 10th, 2013.

2
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,510
Speaker 1: I'm Rim, I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights Tonight.

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,114
Speaker 1: Two board games, Homesteaders and Tammany Hall.

4
00:00:22,298 --> 00:00:23,340
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,060
Speaker 1: Had a pretty good party over the weekend out in Philly, playing some board games in the basement.

6
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:34,480
Speaker 0: Usual party as it goes every year, so it shall continue.

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:42,360
Speaker 1: Yup, but there's something about having a house that's big enough to where the basement was just people who actually wanted to play serious games.

8
00:00:42,963 --> 00:00:46,300
Speaker 1: And then everybody else, so the drunk people were in like one part of the house getting super drunk.

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,560
Speaker 1: And the sort of people who didn't want to do anything or just wanted to play like Wii Bowling were in another part of the house.

10
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:54,000
Speaker 1: And then all the board gamers were in the basement.

11
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:55,440
Speaker 0: Mmm, where they belong.

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:55,881
Speaker 1: Yup.

13
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:58,900
Speaker 1: We had a lot of tables set up, like it was like a tiny convention.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,560
Speaker 1: Like if you just took those three tables and copy pasted them a bunch of times, you have basically tabletop and magfest.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,180
Speaker 0: I've seen conventions with tabletop rooms with equal or less table space to that basement.

16
00:01:11,382 --> 00:01:13,639
Speaker 1: In fact, the first Zenk icon we went to was that.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,400
Speaker 0: Exactly.

18
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,110
Speaker 1: Remember we were hanging out?

19
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:15,640
Speaker 1: We hung out in that one...

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,620
Speaker 0: That was one of the ones that came to mind.

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,120
Speaker 1: We hung out in that one basically conference room with some tables, playing games with each other.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Speaker 0: The library was also comparable.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:25,910
Speaker 1: Yup.

24
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:30,400
Speaker 1: Look, his cold guy brought basically every game that exists.

25
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:30,774
Speaker 1: Right.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,424
Speaker 1: That was a good time.

27
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:35,460
Speaker 1: It's been a while since Scott doesn't come to our board game nights here anymore.

28
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:39,598
Speaker 0: You know, you people aren't playing too many serious games seriously, so...

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,158
Speaker 1: You don't even know what games we play.

30
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,058
Speaker 0: Doesn't even matter.

31
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:43,430
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

32
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,820
Speaker 0: When you play Netrunner, everyone's serious and you play a lot of games really fast.

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,798
Speaker 0: Every time.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,885
Speaker 1: I don't know.

35
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:52,800
Speaker 1: I'm off and on about Netrunner.

36
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:54,138
Speaker 0: Do whatever you want.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Speaker 1: So hey, got any gaming news?

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,404
Speaker 0: Is there a gaming news?

39
00:01:58,465 --> 00:01:58,906
Speaker 0: There is.

40
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:02,560
Speaker 0: Did you notice when you turned on your 3DS today that there was a little update going on?

41
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,020
Speaker 1: Nope, because the wifi was off because why would I have it on?

42
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:07,438
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't you have it on?

43
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:10,699
Speaker 1: Uh, because the battery actually lasts longer if I turn it off.

44
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,607
Speaker 0: Why isn't it plugged in?

45
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,100
Speaker 0: In your house.

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,505
Speaker 1: Sometimes I forget, and I really don't.

47
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:20,260
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm done with the candy boxes, so the wireless literally does nothing for me.

48
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:23,053
Speaker 0: Well, it turns out there's an update today.

49
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,200
Speaker 0: The update does a few things.

50
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,519
Speaker 0: The first thing it does is you now have your Nintendo network ID.

51
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:29,360
Speaker 0: What?

52
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:30,803
Speaker 0: Which is now?

53
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:35,740
Speaker 0: so the Wii U and 3DS accounts are the same account now as it should be.

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,880
Speaker 0: As it should have been from the beginning.

55
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,700
Speaker 1: Alright, so they fixed a grievous flaw.

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,279
Speaker 0: But the problem, they didn't completely fix it, but there's hope that they will.

57
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Speaker 0: See, it's only a partial fix because this account ID really is just sort of signs you in.

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,800
Speaker 0: I think it might also roll in your Club Nintendo account.

59
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,059
Speaker 1: Which I don't have.

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,649
Speaker 0: Which you don't have.

61
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,120
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

62
00:02:57,881 --> 00:03:02,318
Speaker 0: But that's your account for using the Miiverse, which they also added to the 3DS.

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,220
Speaker 1: Wow, I really care about that.

64
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,886
Speaker 0: No, you don't.

65
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:06,959
Speaker 0: You don't care about it at all.

66
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,239
Speaker 1: Can't wait to Miiverse it up in the Miiverse.

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,320
Speaker 0: Miiverse is basically just the official Nintendo forum, basically.

68
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,560
Speaker 0: And it's the most heavily moderated and useless forum in existence.

69
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,860
Speaker 1: Well, considering they basically turned off Swap Note because people were drawing dicks.

70
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:28,479
Speaker 0: Right, well this is just a heavily moderated forum where you can comment on games and it'll verify, like, this person has the game, this person doesn't.

71
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,195
Speaker 1: Wait, but comment on the game via the 3DS?

72
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:31,499
Speaker 0: Yes.

73
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,759
Speaker 1: That's the worst.

74
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:33,513
Speaker 0: Yes.

75
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:41,760
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, the other day, like I wanted to-- You can also take screenshots of your games and then post them in 3D screenshots.

76
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,280
Speaker 1: I guess I kind of ignored a lot of that because I play just single player games now.

77
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,060
Speaker 1: I mean, no one will play multiplayer 3DS games with me ever.

78
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,139
Speaker 0: Like which one?

79
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:50,864
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.

80
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:53,300
Speaker 1: Mario Kart, Mario Tennis, Advance Wars, anything.

81
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:54,240
Speaker 0: I'll play Mario Tennis.

82
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:54,923
Speaker 0: Will you?

83
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:55,408
Speaker 1: Will you?

84
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:56,840
Speaker 1: Mario Kart's a better game.

85
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,600
Speaker 1: In fact, I actually kind of want to get rid of Mario Tennis because it's kind of a shit Mario Tennis.

86
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,120
Speaker 0: No, whatever you're going to do.

87
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,809
Speaker 1: It's kind of baby's first Mario Tennis.

88
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,740
Speaker 1: They took a lot of these skill components out.

89
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,060
Speaker 0: We already discussed that a long time ago.

90
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,536
Speaker 1: I know, but it's basically just a kind of boring.

91
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:10,060
Speaker 1: Simon Says.

92
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,059
Speaker 1: At least Mario Kart has a little bit more going on.

93
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,540
Speaker 0: Snaking.

94
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:15,880
Speaker 1: This isn't really snaking.

95
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,247
Speaker 1: Really?

96
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:18,630
Speaker 1: So, playing Pokemon.

97
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,860
Speaker 1: Wanted to trade some Pokemon.

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,400
Speaker 1: That was when I discovered...

99
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,360
Speaker 0: I want to play a game with a skill component like Pokemon where the only skill is patience.

100
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,159
Speaker 1: No, that's a single player game.

101
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:31,719
Speaker 0: Pokemon is a single player game, huh?

102
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:33,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

103
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,159
Speaker 1: So, I wanted to trade some Pokemon just for fun.

104
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:46,460
Speaker 1: And I kind of remembered suddenly that you have to go into some deep part of your DS and set up all this stuff to make that be able to happen because of Nintendo's friend code stuff.

105
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,620
Speaker 1: Nintendo is on the road to ruin.

106
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,500
Speaker 1: Like, the Wii U is not selling.

107
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,259
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, the Wii U is dead, but supposedly...

108
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,100
Speaker 1: The 3DS is not really doing it for me as time goes on either.

109
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:05,330
Speaker 0: The network ID and the friend codes might merge, and then hopefully by the time Smash Bros.

110
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:07,640
Speaker 0: comes out, things will not suck.

111
00:05:07,943 --> 00:05:08,115
Speaker 0: You know?

112
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:11,719
Speaker 0: And then you can also transfer with the Nintendo network ID.

113
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,397
Speaker 0: You can transfer your shit from one 3DS to another.

114
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:15,920
Speaker 1: I have a prediction.

115
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,709
Speaker 1: I think the Smash Bros.

116
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:19,500
Speaker 1: that comes out is going to be a big disappointment.

117
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,040
Speaker 0: Maybe, but I think the 3DS one will do well.

118
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,118
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

119
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:34,339
Speaker 1: The history of the 3DS versions of other games they've had that have been competitive have been reducing the skill cap in every step.

120
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,309
Speaker 0: Oh, you think that the...

121
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:43,120
Speaker 1: The hardcore community won't go past the one from the GameCube.

122
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,700
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say that's not possible.

123
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,119
Speaker 1: I think it's likely.

124
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,380
Speaker 0: That is somewhat likely.

125
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:49,820
Speaker 1: I don't trust Nintendo anymore.

126
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,060
Speaker 1: I think I've bought fewer games for the 3DS than for any console I've ever owned except the Xbox.

127
00:05:56,801 --> 00:06:01,120
Speaker 0: You've got to go for the games like the Phoenix Rites and the Leytons.

128
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,356
Speaker 0: I think those are the games that are best on the 3DS.

129
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,450
Speaker 1: I've seen so many of those on the regular non-3DS that more of them aren't actually fun.

130
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,500
Speaker 1: There's nothing new to explore.

131
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,940
Speaker 0: I can play as many Phoenix Rites as they make as long as it's new people and whatnot.

132
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I got kind of sick of them because the gameplay didn't really...

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
Speaker 0: No, it's the same goddamn gameplay over and over.

134
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,796
Speaker 0: It's about seeing a different funny story and going,

135
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:25,038
Speaker 0: "Lol.".

136
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,839
Speaker 1: But then I'd rather just play a straight up visual novel.

137
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,280
Speaker 0: Phoenix Rite is a visual novel, basically.

138
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,879
Speaker 0: No, but they don't branch.

139
00:06:31,864 --> 00:06:32,800
Speaker 1: They don't branch at all.

140
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,100
Speaker 0: It's just true it doesn't branch, but it's almost a visual novel.

141
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:42,140
Speaker 1: Every complaint I have about Phoenix Rite games after the first couple is the same as your complaints about most adventure games.

142
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,739
Speaker 1: Click on everything until you win.

143
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:46,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is in Phoenix Rite...

144
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:47,116
Speaker 1: What?

145
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,560
Speaker 0: The one difference in Phoenix Rite... Phoenix Rite is an adventure game, right?

146
00:06:50,620 --> 00:07:00,755
Speaker 0: It is click on everything until you win, but in Phoenix Rite, unlike, say, a LucasArts adventure game, like, say, a Maniac Mansion, it's actually pretty common sense 90% of the time.

147
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:01,419
Speaker 0: what to click on.

148
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:02,718
Speaker 0: It's not like, you know...

149
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,390
Speaker 1: So it's even less of a game and more of just a... It's not even an idea game.

150
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:06,875
Speaker 1: It's just a...

151
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,700
Speaker 0: It's click to continue the story.

152
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:09,033
Speaker 0: Yeah.

153
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:14,140
Speaker 1: I at least want a visual novel where click to date character A versus character B.

154
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,440
Speaker 0: I'd rather present evidence to continue the story than have a random encounter in Final Fantasy to continue the story.

155
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, not disagreeing there.

156
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:21,900
Speaker 0: That's all I'm saying.

157
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:31,497
Speaker 1: I got sick of Phoenix Rite games and Layton Games increasingly had the kinds of puzzles I don't give a shit about and had fewer and fewer of the interesting interactive puzzles that were the whole point of the game.

158
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:34,639
Speaker 0: I guess the Layton Games story went up.

159
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,080
Speaker 0: I can't even... Like, all the Layton Games now sort of just blur together.

160
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,360
Speaker 0: Like, I forget which one's which at this point.

161
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:45,040
Speaker 1: I feel like as time goes on, there were more and more puzzles that were basically just algebra and they weren't very interactive.

162
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:46,620
Speaker 1: They were just like, "Here's a bunch of stuff.

163
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:47,806
Speaker 1: What's the number?

164
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:48,228
Speaker 1: that is the

165
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,450
Speaker 1: answer?".

166
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:55,700
Speaker 1: And if I want that, I can just read a book and simultaneously read a book of puzzles.

167
00:07:56,502 --> 00:08:01,138
Speaker 0: You could watch the Layton plot on YouTube, but it won't be in 3D.

168
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what I'm going to watch on YouTube, though?

169
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,079
Speaker 1: The plot to that Adventure Time game.

170
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:13,700
Speaker 1: Because it's basically an Adventure Time episode hidden behind one of the shittiest games ever made and published on a cartridge.

171
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,520
Speaker 0: Everyone is saying this game is so bad.

172
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:21,940
Speaker 0: I think that Adventure Time game, years from now, is going to be remembered as bad game, like the way Superman 64 is remembered as bad game.

173
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,720
Speaker 1: The only thing that bothers me is that there are people who were surprised that it was a bad game.

174
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,380
Speaker 1: Guys, we knew this was going to be a bad game.

175
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Speaker 0: Those are people who super-like the other Adventure Time game.

176
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,780
Speaker 1: I can't imagine a human being who isn't like five who liked the previous Adventure Time game.

177
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,840
Speaker 1: The company that makes those games has either the worst game designers in the world or is a company of people who literally give zero fucks.

178
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,260
Speaker 0: And supposedly Penn Ward approved and worked on these things.

179
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,899
Speaker 1: Well then, Pendleton Ward has terrible taste in games.

180
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:55,979
Speaker 1: Or it's a Camp Krusty situation.

181
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:58,879
Speaker 1: The Krusty Seal of Quality.

182
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:04,020
Speaker 1: So this is not a news.

183
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,460
Speaker 1: This is just kind of a fun, interesting article.

184
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:09,480
Speaker 1: But it's a Tatillo article, but it's good.

185
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:10,446
Speaker 1: I shouldn't say

186
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:10,689
Speaker 1: "but."

187
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:11,418
Speaker 1: He's not that bad.

188
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,259
Speaker 1: So this is just memories of the original creation of Doom.

189
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,138
Speaker 1: You know, back in the early 90s.

190
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,798
Speaker 0: A game that Tatillo hadn't played until a few years ago?

191
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:21,983
Speaker 1: Yup.

192
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:24,460
Speaker 1: By John Romero and John Carmack.

193
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,599
Speaker 1: So it's John Romero and John Carmack talking about their memories in the early days of creating Doom.

194
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,440
Speaker 0: Except all that stuff is heavily documented.

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,980
Speaker 0: And if you're interested, you've already seen all that documentary.

196
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,020
Speaker 1: Exactly, but I know that most of you jackasses haven't.

197
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,520
Speaker 1: And I know that most of the people who listen to Geek Nights have probably never actually played Doom or Doom 2.

198
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,617
Speaker 0: There's like books about it.

199
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,653
Speaker 0: What happened?

200
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,959
Speaker 1: I don't think I understand that Doom had multiplayer FPSing.

201
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:52,738
Speaker 0: Doom, not Doon.

202
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:53,520
Speaker 1: Doom.

203
00:09:54,841 --> 00:10:00,220
Speaker 1: Doom had multiplayer FPSing in an era where such a thing was inconceivable.

204
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,639
Speaker 0: It was the first ever multiplayer FPSing.

205
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,999
Speaker 1: I mean, Wolfenstein was...

206
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,768
Speaker 0: That I know of.

207
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:05,920
Speaker 0: Wolfenstein wasn't multiplayer.

208
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,280
Speaker 1: Wolfenstein, by many definitions, isn't a first-person shooter.

209
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,559
Speaker 1: It was like a first-person maser that had shooting.

210
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a maze game where you also had to kill guys.

211
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:24,700
Speaker 0: It was closer to a D&D kind of gold box game with the first person walking around the dungeon, except you fought with real-time battles as opposed to the turn-based.

212
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,280
Speaker 0: And you didn't just move one square at a time.

213
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,320
Speaker 0: You could just move freely.

214
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,380
Speaker 1: But this is fun because it's got some good little quotes.

215
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,893
Speaker 1: And then it has basically an eight-year-old who reviewed Doom when it came out.

216
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:42,020
Speaker 1: Also, these pictures of John Romero and John Carmack are...

217
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:43,040
Speaker 0: ...destroyed with experience.

218
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,150
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day!

219
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,230
Speaker 1: It's hard to have good video of this because of copyright problems.

220
00:10:55,051 --> 00:11:03,690
Speaker 1: But while we were at this party in Philly at our friend Scojo and Laura's house, on the way home, we stopped to get... Are you going to keep humming the Doom music poorly?

221
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:06,170
Speaker 1: Which Doom level are you even humming?

222
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:09,950
Speaker 1: What Doom level are you even humming?

223
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:14,350
Speaker 1: You kind of just went off into La La Land after the first verse.

224
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:15,788
Speaker 1: The first stanza.

225
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,570
Speaker 1: No, I'm good.

226
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're good?

227
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,310
Speaker 1: I'm good.

228
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:24,149
Speaker 1: So we were at this place eating some brunch before we get on the road, and suddenly this huge blizzard comes through.

229
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,390
Speaker 1: And meanwhile, on the TV in the sports bar, there is a football game.

230
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,990
Speaker 1: And the football game is not that far away because it's the Lions versus the Eagles.

231
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,169
Speaker 1: And that football game has the same blizzard going on.

232
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,470
Speaker 1: Nothing is better than football blizzard.

233
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,390
Speaker 1: Watch this clip.

234
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,130
Speaker 1: This is a play that has a problem and the referee calling it out.

235
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,929
Speaker 1: You can't see shit.

236
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:57,570
Speaker 0: There's a great article, if you search for it, I don't know if I'll find the link for Thing of the Day posting, maybe I will, about a guy who is a photographer at the game, right?

237
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,749
Speaker 0: And basically, when it's snowing like that, autofocus doesn't do shit.

238
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:02,290
Speaker 1: Yup.

239
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:03,709
Speaker 0: It just focuses on the snow.

240
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:05,850
Speaker 0: So you can't get no pictures, right?

241
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:10,110
Speaker 0: And basically all the guys there had these gigantic lenses, right?

242
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:13,290
Speaker 0: The ones that you always see, they go to 400.

243
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,807
Speaker 0: They zoom way the fuck in so you can get pictures of people all the way on the other side of the field, right?

244
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,270
Speaker 0: And basically, those are worthless without autofocus.

245
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,029
Speaker 0: You're just fucked.

246
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,810
Speaker 0: So basically, what happened at the game is all those photographers switched to lenses that zoom less, right?

247
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:32,889
Speaker 0: And then they would just take shots of people that were closer and they wouldn't really get shots of people in the middle of the field.

248
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,209
Speaker 0: So this one photographer, he saw everyone else doing that and he was like, hmm.

249
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:42,109
Speaker 0: So he kept his big ass lens on and he manual zoomed.

250
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,269
Speaker 0: I mean, manual focused.

251
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,188
Speaker 1: Damn, son.

252
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,350
Speaker 0: And he's like, let's see if I can manual focus this shit.

253
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:52,630
Speaker 0: And it was a huge pain in the ass, but he got some pictures.

254
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,950
Speaker 0: And the pictures he got, basically no one else got.

255
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,349
Speaker 0: And they're pretty great.

256
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:57,950
Speaker 0: Also, fuck the Eagles.

257
00:12:58,431 --> 00:12:58,849
Speaker 0: Fuck the Eagles.

258
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:08,809
Speaker 1: In terms of this game, the beautiful thing about football is that unless a bomb goes off or lightning starts striking, they play no matter what.

259
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,970
Speaker 1: And that's something that esports really don't have.

260
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,789
Speaker 1: You don't have the adverse, like, they're going to play the game and then suddenly it starts raining.

261
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't have home field advantages unless it's like an international competition and they happen to be playing in one of the countries, right?

262
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,130
Speaker 0: And then you don't have any sort of adverse conditions or anything like that.

263
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,249
Speaker 1: And it's an aspect that other sports don't even have because they're pansies and they don't play if the weather's bad.

264
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:33,670
Speaker 1: Looking at you, baseball.

265
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:37,829
Speaker 0: I do think that's something if I made I would love to watch baseball in the snow.

266
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,109
Speaker 0: You know, that is something if I made sort of a Dota-like game or any sort of competitive game like that.

267
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, there would be a random condition that applies equally to all, right?

268
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,349
Speaker 0: That would just be on in the real mode, right?

269
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:53,570
Speaker 0: And that would simulate, you know, the weather.

270
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,183
Speaker 1: Yup, because yes, this adds some randomness, but at the same time It applies all equally.

271
00:13:58,264 --> 00:13:58,970
Speaker 0: Everyone's in the snow.

272
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,389
Speaker 1: It forces teams.

273
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:15,730
Speaker 1: For example, there could be a team that's really good at X and Y skill sets, but not so good at Z. But then suddenly, every now and then, there's the game where crazy wind or crazy snow doesn't let their basic strategies work and now they're fucked.

274
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:21,270
Speaker 1: So it sort of forces teams to be able to adapt and to be able to take advantage of that.

275
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,110
Speaker 1: Kind of like bowling.

276
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,310
Speaker 1: Bowling, if all lanes were the same everywhere, like if they had a way to make lanes really, really uniform.

277
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,920
Speaker 0: Oh, 100% identical.

278
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,790
Speaker 0: Same exact wood from the same exact tree.

279
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,010
Speaker 1: Every professional bowler would bowl a perfect or near perfect game every time.

280
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,527
Speaker 0: Yup.

281
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:44,230
Speaker 1: But the real skill of bowling is figuring out what's up with the lane at the tournament right now and adapting to that.

282
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,110
Speaker 0: Right, and most people aren't good enough at bowling to where the slight difference between lanes matters.

283
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:52,110
Speaker 0: When you're a pro, suddenly it matters.

284
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,949
Speaker 1: So yeah, watch this clip and try to imagine being a ref at this game.

285
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:02,247
Speaker 1: Also, the clip will probably be taken down sometime soon by the NFL, so watch it soon.

286
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:02,745
Speaker 1: Maybe.

287
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:04,530
Speaker 0: Is that your thing of the day?

288
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, my thing of the day.

289
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:06,689
Speaker 0: Alright, so my thing of the day.

290
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,409
Speaker 0: Apparently, it's another sports-related thing of the day.

291
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:10,370
Speaker 1: Sportsball!

292
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,490
Speaker 0: Sportsball.

293
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,530
Speaker 0: In fact, one of the sports I hate to watch, basketballs.

294
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,250
Speaker 1: I'd rather watch soccer than basketball.

295
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:17,868
Speaker 0: I agree.

296
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:22,330
Speaker 0: But basketball is probably a better sport.

297
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,990
Speaker 0: It's just even more boring to watch than a broken sport.

298
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:33,610
Speaker 0: Anyway, there is a university named Taylor University and they have a tradition and the tradition is Silent Night basketball game.

299
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:40,730
Speaker 0: and the way it works is they show up to the basketball game and they're all crazy costumes, college, drunken, frat boy, whatever, right?

300
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,490
Speaker 0: But they're quiet because it's Silent Night and they don't make any noise.

301
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:47,110
Speaker 0: Maybe some clapping, like nice, polite clapping.

302
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:47,748
Speaker 0: That's about it.

303
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:52,330
Speaker 1: Like the kind of clapping you would see at early hockey games in the South before they understood hockey.

304
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:57,149
Speaker 0: All you hear is the squeaking of basketball shoes and the ref and maybe the players, right?

305
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:03,210
Speaker 0: And then as soon as their team scores the tenth point, everyone goes crazy go nuts.

306
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:04,900
Speaker 0: I think the operative term is ape shit.

307
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,669
Speaker 1: They go ape shit.

308
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,810
Speaker 0: Ape shit is correct.

309
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:16,910
Speaker 0: And then they do a whole bunch of other stuff too, like singing Silent Night towards the end of the game with what sounded like possibly modified lyrics.

310
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,089
Speaker 0: Not sure.

311
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:18,818
Speaker 1: I couldn't 100% tell.

312
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,310
Speaker 0: Couldn't really make them out in the video.

313
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:33,730
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's a tradition that's been going on for a long time so it's easy to read a lot of articles about it and also there's YouTube videos of it going way back but we'll probably just link to the newest one and you can Google for more if you're interested.

314
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,730
Speaker 1: It's pretty incredible.

315
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:38,310
Speaker 0: Good tradition, unique, get seal of approval.

316
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,770
Speaker 1: Now, the reason I like hockey is that every goal is like that.

317
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:47,445
Speaker 1: So yeah, in the meta moment the Book Club book is...

318
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,790
Speaker 0: Aydaru by William Gibson.

319
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,510
Speaker 0: Some people have already told me they read it.

320
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,439
Speaker 0: I haven't even read one letter of it but people said that they read it and liked it and were like, "Yeah,

321
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:56,967
Speaker 0: awesome.".

322
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:05,970
Speaker 1: I plowed a significant portion of the way through it and took it aside to read a bunch of old Lovecraft short stories that I hadn't actually ever read.

323
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:08,990
Speaker 0: Other readers, other listeners enjoy this book.

324
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:09,948
Speaker 0: It's a good book.

325
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:12,367
Speaker 1: It's very cyberpunk-y.

326
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,108
Speaker 1: Yeah.

327
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,990
Speaker 1: That might be how I would describe it as cyberpunk.

328
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:16,910
Speaker 0: Made a cyberpunk move.

329
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,449
Speaker 1: Also, you know what?

330
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,890
Speaker 1: The topic that it's nominally about, virtual idols.

331
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:23,270
Speaker 0: Super relevant.

332
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of actually happening.

333
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,869
Speaker 1: We're seeing this start to happen.

334
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:27,890
Speaker 1: Sharon Apple's coming.

335
00:17:29,154 --> 00:17:30,210
Speaker 0: She's named Hatsune Miku.

336
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:30,625
Speaker 0: I know.

337
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,669
Speaker 1: She hasn't tried to take over our military industrial complex yet.

338
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:36,968
Speaker 0: That is not true.

339
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,702
Speaker 1: Yeah, join our forum.

340
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:41,430
Speaker 1: Watch us on YouTube.

341
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,330
Speaker 1: We're going to be at MAGFest.

342
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,270
Speaker 1: We're going to be on Bad Games.

343
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,829
Speaker 0: MAGFest is way, way soon.

344
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,310
Speaker 1: Bad Games.

345
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,509
Speaker 0: Listen, I'm going to work for three more days this week.

346
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,669
Speaker 0: Five more days next week.

347
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:59,910
Speaker 0: Then I am not going back to work until January 6th, I believe, which is the day after MAGFest.

348
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:01,817
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

349
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,269
Speaker 0: MAGFest is that soon.

350
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:04,927
Speaker 0: That is how soon it is.

351
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,749
Speaker 1: So, we're going to be there doing Bad Games, a longer version of what we already did at PAX.

352
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,289
Speaker 1: It's going to be longer and therefore badder.

353
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,150
Speaker 1: Scott's going to be on a panel of experts talking about game controllers.

354
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:19,730
Speaker 1: I'm going to be on a similar panel of experts talking about privacy in games.

355
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:27,470
Speaker 1: And Scott and I are both going to be gigantic assholes together on a panel about the future of games, 10 and 30 years from now.

356
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:32,490
Speaker 0: I may have to skip one or more of these if they schedule it parallel to the Machine Supremacy Council.

357
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,370
Speaker 0: Scott, you're turning into Vic.

358
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,050
Speaker 1: Your convention fame is getting to you.

359
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:36,849
Speaker 1: You're going to be Vic.

360
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:43,185
Speaker 1: You're going to be that guest where the convention staff are running around like, "Where the fuck is Scott?

361
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:43,490
Speaker 1: I don't know.

362
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,338
Speaker 1: His panel is starting.

363
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:44,863
Speaker 1: Where is he?

364
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:45,570
Speaker 1: Who's his handler?

365
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:45,975
Speaker 1: I don't know.

366
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:46,423
Speaker 0: We want it

367
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:46,709
Speaker 0: off.".

368
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:52,030
Speaker 0: It is rare that I would do such a thing, but this is a special circumstance, right?

369
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:53,983
Speaker 0: I've waited over 10 years.

370
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:56,810
Speaker 0: The band that PAX couldn't even get.

371
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,350
Speaker 0: For this one band to come from fucking Northern Europe.

372
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,862
Speaker 0: Are they from Norway, Sweden?

373
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:02,630
Speaker 0: I think they're Swedish.

374
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,810
Speaker 0: You don't know anything about them.

375
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,609
Speaker 0: They're definitely Swedish.

376
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,009
Speaker 0: I've waited over 10 years to then come to the United States.

377
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,560
Speaker 0: They have come, right?

378
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,169
Speaker 1: Well, they're not here yet.

379
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,270
Speaker 0: Nothing happens in customs and they don't get deported or something.

380
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,374
Speaker 1: Don't laugh.

381
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:16,989
Speaker 1: That happened to a guest of Connecticut once.

382
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,209
Speaker 0: That could definitely happen.

383
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,130
Speaker 0: That did happen.

384
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,390
Speaker 0: That's why I'm worried about it happening.

385
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,469
Speaker 0: So if it doesn't happen, it's even more of a miracle, which is why I must go see them no matter what.

386
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,790
Speaker 1: This guest doesn't go to any panels.

387
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:27,756
Speaker 1: He's like, "Oh, yeah.

388
00:19:27,796 --> 00:19:29,065
Speaker 1: He got denied at the

389
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:29,367
Speaker 1: border.".

390
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:30,033
Speaker 0: Yeah.

391
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:31,810
Speaker 0: All right.

392
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,312
Speaker 1: Yeah.

393
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:33,770
Speaker 1: MagFest is going to be pretty awesome.

394
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,769
Speaker 1: And then there's a lull.

395
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,368
Speaker 1: Geek nights will return.

396
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,269
Speaker 0: Geek nights may be a little spotty.

397
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,909
Speaker 1: We might be a little spotty until then, but then we'll return.

398
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:46,749
Speaker 1: Also, ski season is starting, so I may be at Hunter Mountain this weekend if any of you punk kids want to meet me there.

399
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,030
Speaker 0: I think this is Saturday.

400
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,210
Speaker 0: The Saturday runner tournament this weekend.

401
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:50,230
Speaker 0: Saturday at the Strad.

402
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,530
Speaker 1: Well, I told Scott, if I don't go skiing, I'm going to go play net runner.

403
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,110
Speaker 0: You're actually going to go to the net runner tournament?

404
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:55,970
Speaker 1: If I don't go skiing.

405
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:57,729
Speaker 0: You know what costs five bucks, right?

406
00:19:58,011 --> 00:19:58,334
Speaker 0: What?

407
00:19:58,395 --> 00:19:59,609
Speaker 1: That's basically zero.

408
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,679
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

409
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,470
Speaker 0: You might not want to pay.

410
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:02,870
Speaker 1: I spent more than that on coffee today.

411
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:07,370
Speaker 0: If you went to a net runner tournament in your current net runner game state, that would be hilarious.

412
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,729
Speaker 1: The thing is, as bad as I am, would it possibly be a player of game situation?

413
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,509
Speaker 1: Like, would I at least beat all the scrubs?

414
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,410
Speaker 1: Just by being smart.

415
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,530
Speaker 0: If you prepared some amount, you could possibly be ahead of a few scrubs.

416
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:26,707
Speaker 1: If I made a deck that wasn't bullshit and I actually knew what cards were in it.

417
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:27,704
Speaker 0: Yes.

418
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:31,330
Speaker 0: And you maybe played one or two games with it beforehand.

419
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:33,925
Speaker 0: And you picked a deck that was...

420
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,127
Speaker 1: Not hard to use.

421
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,089
Speaker 0: Not hard to use.

422
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:36,625
Speaker 1: But also not...

423
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,750
Speaker 0: But not completely ineffective.

424
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:46,089
Speaker 0: If you did a standard fast advance and something else simple, just like an Andromeda deck, you could probably do okay.

425
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,210
Speaker 0: Yeah.

426
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:53,208
Speaker 0: You would beat the scrubs and then basically what happened is you would get paired randomly in the first round and you'd probably lose both.

427
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,329
Speaker 0: And then you would, because you lost both, would go against a scrub and you'd have a chance.

428
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,470
Speaker 0: And then if you beat them, you would play someone hard and lose again.

429
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,370
Speaker 1: Dude, I entered a Magic Tournament once and I went into this thing.

430
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,150
Speaker 1: I was a reasonably good Magic player, but I just didn't give a fuck.

431
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:11,043
Speaker 1: I showed up with, like, a 200 card deck.

432
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:14,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only Magic Tournament I was ever in.

433
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,490
Speaker 0: My deck was not stupid, but I just lost.

434
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,630
Speaker 0: Because I played against a guy who was actually good in the first round.

435
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,889
Speaker 1: I got to the quarter finals with my 200 card deck.

436
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:29,349
Speaker 0: But luckily, right, and that was so long ago that they were still doing single elimination and not Swiss, so I only got to play the one game and that was it.

437
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:29,829
Speaker 1: Yup.

438
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,488
Speaker 0: So, there you go.

439
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:32,367
Speaker 1: Oh, Magic.

440
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:34,410
Speaker 1: My mom's trying to ship me all my Magic cards.

441
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,728
Speaker 1: I'm like, "No, just sell them.

442
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,117
Speaker 1: No, don't ship them

443
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:37,380
Speaker 1: here.".

444
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:38,610
Speaker 0: Bad news.

445
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:39,349
Speaker 0: I have mine.

446
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:50,650
Speaker 0: Oh, you should go on all the places on the internet that we exist, like YouTube and Twitter, Facebook, et cetera, et cetera, Google+, and follow us on all the things, Tumblr's, whatnot.

447
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:51,129
Speaker 0: Yeah.

448
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,847
Speaker 0: Do that.

449
00:21:52,373 --> 00:22:02,610
Speaker 1: So, at this board game night, we played two awesome games with a bunch of awesome people, and in the spirit of us doing what we do, we're going to review them based on one playthrough.

450
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,130
Speaker 0: One playthrough review.

451
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,130
Speaker 0: What game did you play, Rim?

452
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:08,049
Speaker 1: I played a game called Homesteaders.

453
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,210
Speaker 0: Is it about wagons in Oklahoma?

454
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:14,670
Speaker 1: It's basically a mini version of the bidding of Amun-Re.

455
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,530
Speaker 0: Okay, so the bidding for the territory.

456
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,450
Speaker 1: Coupled with a sort of Agricola Kalis worker placement game.

457
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,630
Speaker 0: So you bid for places to put workers?

458
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,509
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

459
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,430
Speaker 1: You have some workers.

460
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,390
Speaker 1: It's kind of hard to explain because it doesn't quite fit the way these games tend to work.

461
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,190
Speaker 0: That's good.

462
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,230
Speaker 0: You don't want something that's just another member of the same.

463
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,690
Speaker 1: So what you do is there's three slots.

464
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:36,070
Speaker 1: Say there's four players.

465
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:42,329
Speaker 1: You've got three slots, and there's Amun-Re style bidding between the three slots, but there's four players.

466
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:43,669
Speaker 0: So someone's going to get fucked.

467
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,549
Speaker 0: Whoever gets fucked- What's the booby prize?

468
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,150
Speaker 1: Passes and moves up the pass track, which gets you a thing.

469
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, booby prize.

470
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:56,670
Speaker 1: Sometimes you want the booby prize, but you don't want other people to get one of the slots for cheap.

471
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,890
Speaker 1: So you bid, hoping to be later outbid, and then someone else passes and you're fucked.

472
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:04,930
Speaker 1: You have to buy something that you didn't want, and then you go into debt.

473
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:05,703
Speaker 0: I like that.

474
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:05,990
Speaker 0: Good.

475
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,584
Speaker 1: All right.

476
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,668
Speaker 1: So it's got that going on.

477
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,750
Speaker 1: But what you buy is the right to buy.

478
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,089
Speaker 1: You basically get a property, like a space that you could buy a building for.

479
00:23:15,614 --> 00:23:22,129
Speaker 1: But you have to pay the bid in cash, and you also have to pay the material cost of the building that you want to put on it.

480
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,549
Speaker 0: So you might bid on the slot that says- And then you can't afford to put anything in?

481
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:26,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you're just fucked.

482
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,890
Speaker 1: You might bid on the spot that's like, "Only a residential building can go here,".

483
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,829
Speaker 1: and then you can buy any of the residential buildings.

484
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:39,665
Speaker 1: And there's different kinds of buildings, and they all cost like copper or gold or food or iron or wood.

485
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,469
Speaker 1: There's a million kinds of resources.

486
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:48,209
Speaker 1: And you buy these things, build a machine, crank it, crank it, crank it, victory points, games over in 10 rounds.

487
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,470
Speaker 1: How it's cooked slightly so is that you can have workers, and they cost money.

488
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,389
Speaker 1: You have to pay them wages.

489
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:59,350
Speaker 1: And you place workers on your own buildings to get work out of them.

490
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,409
Speaker 1: And every turn, you reallocate your workers.

491
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,789
Speaker 1: You can just keep buying more workers if you want.

492
00:24:06,297 --> 00:24:06,550
Speaker 0: Okay.

493
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,590
Speaker 1: There's no babby phase.

494
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:12,348
Speaker 1: If you could pay it for a worker, and you can use some food to hire him, then you could just keep paying him.

495
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:23,710
Speaker 1: But with the workers and the trading in general, you can also trade goods freely, and there's a whole chart on one gold can turn into one copper or one cow and one victory point.

496
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,649
Speaker 1: You can trade at any time.

497
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:28,870
Speaker 1: At any time.

498
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,369
Speaker 1: In the middle of a fa-- Any time you want, you can trade.

499
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:37,110
Speaker 1: But you need a trading chit for each transaction you wish to complete.

500
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,430
Speaker 1: Trading chits are one more commodity that you can get from buildings.

501
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,689
Speaker 0: Can you trade trading chits?

502
00:24:42,062 --> 00:24:42,208
Speaker 1: No.

503
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,030
Speaker 0: So I can't spend a trading chit to trade other trading chits?

504
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:54,370
Speaker 1: No, but you could use a trading chit to turn a gold into a copper, then use the copper and a food on a trading chit that you use through something else to buy a building.

505
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,910
Speaker 0: So every time you convert something, you need to use a trading chit.

506
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:57,141
Speaker 0: Yes.

507
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,189
Speaker 0: How do you get a trading chit?

508
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:01,170
Speaker 1: It's another commodity you can get from buildings and workers and stuff.

509
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:01,546
Speaker 0: I got it.

510
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:03,195
Speaker 1: So a building might give you-- You get it.

511
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:04,089
Speaker 0: the same way you get a wood.

512
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:09,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, a building might have a slot that says get a trading chit and two gold, and another slot that says get two victory points.

513
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,989
Speaker 1: Allocate workers as you see fit.

514
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:20,009
Speaker 1: The nice thing about this game is that at the very end, there's a final phase, so you don't have to worry about like, oh, I didn't finish my shit in time.

515
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:30,509
Speaker 1: After the last round of bidding, you have one more round of income, so you get everything that you paid for one last time, and then you can trade freely as long as you want, and then everyone scores.

516
00:25:31,752 --> 00:25:32,790
Speaker 1: Still using trading chits.

517
00:25:33,552 --> 00:25:38,970
Speaker 1: So the game doesn't have that sort of abrupt end where suddenly you're fucked that some games like that tend to have.

518
00:25:40,153 --> 00:25:41,970
Speaker 1: It was actually moderately fun.

519
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,550
Speaker 1: I won pretty handily, but it was a pretty good game.

520
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,869
Speaker 0: You won handily?

521
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:47,406
Speaker 1: I did.

522
00:25:48,293 --> 00:26:00,729
Speaker 1: But I feel like the problem with this game is that it's not terribly complex, and having played it once, it would take us maybe four or five playthroughs, and we would never need to play this game again.

523
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:07,950
Speaker 0: We would have it-- Because, I mean, just the thing where you can get as many workers as you want or as you can afford, that is like, it's so unlimiting.

524
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:09,930
Speaker 1: No, because no one built fucking workers.

525
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,429
Speaker 1: You start with two, I had four at the end.

526
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:17,170
Speaker 1: One guy had a bunch of workers, but one guy had three workers.

527
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,989
Speaker 0: Is it just so much competition for the spaces that there's no reason to buy more because you're not going to get to put them?

528
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:24,430
Speaker 1: You'll actually have more spaces than workers.

529
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,449
Speaker 1: It's just that not all the spaces are that worth it.

530
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,070
Speaker 0: So it's like buying another worker is going to not have a good payout because he's going to go in a shitty space every time.

531
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:31,631
Speaker 1: Yeah.

532
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:37,690
Speaker 1: Also, I think most of us were kind of new to the game, so a lot of people were taking suboptimal strategies to victory.

533
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:46,770
Speaker 0: But, I mean, even if there's a diminishing return, if you tell me I can get as many workers as I want right away in a worker placement game, I'm getting at least a second, third worker early.

534
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,770
Speaker 1: Yep, I got a third worker as soon as I possibly could.

535
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,225
Speaker 1: There you go.

536
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:51,749
Speaker 0: And you won handily.

537
00:26:51,930 --> 00:27:01,709
Speaker 1: Also, the player who had the most experience and who taught us the game tried to do what I do when I'm playing against a bunch of noobs, but I players of games did.

538
00:27:03,352 --> 00:27:06,650
Speaker 1: The other interesting thing is that you can go into infinite debt.

539
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:08,989
Speaker 1: You can just keep taking debt.

540
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:10,990
Speaker 1: You can take debt tokens any time.

541
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:11,729
Speaker 0: Like Age of Steam?

542
00:27:12,051 --> 00:27:17,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, they get you two money immediately, and you have to pay back five money to get rid of them.

543
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,528
Speaker 1: But there's buildings that'll get rid of them too.

544
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:20,529
Speaker 1: You can take any number of them.

545
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,170
Speaker 1: The first one's worth negative one point at the end of the game.

546
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:25,910
Speaker 1: The second one is worth negative two points.

547
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,730
Speaker 1: The third one is worth negative three.

548
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,889
Speaker 1: So if I have three, that's negative six points.

549
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,986
Speaker 1: Ooh.

550
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,229
Speaker 1: So it builds up.

551
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,049
Speaker 0: Factorially.

552
00:27:33,573 --> 00:27:39,809
Speaker 1: However, I feel like people who win this game are going to have two of these things hanging around at the end of the game.

553
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,130
Speaker 0: Otherwise you won't have enough money to actually do anything.

554
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:43,418
Speaker 0: Yeah.

555
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:49,289
Speaker 1: It's a fun worker placement game like Amun-Re or Agricola even.

556
00:27:50,231 --> 00:28:00,670
Speaker 1: It'll have the fun sort of like build your machine component, but if you're smart, you'll figure out the most optimal machines, which it seems complex, but actually you can calculate your paths through the game pretty quickly.

557
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:23,010
Speaker 1: The game sort of doesn't fall into the trap that Ground Floor did, in that while you can have these crazy trade combinations, like I would calculate out, well, I'll trade a food on this trading shit to get a wood or to get a steel, and simultaneously I'll trade this gold for a victory point and a cow, but then I'll use the cow and two money and take one debt token and this other trade to make this thing happen.

558
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:25,389
Speaker 1: But other players can't really fuck you up.

559
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,769
Speaker 1: The only way they can fuck you up is if they outbid you.

560
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:33,629
Speaker 1: So like Amun-Re, if you're good at the game, the bidding is all that matters.

561
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:42,349
Speaker 1: Or Agricola, if you're good at the game, placement on other people's spots, preventing them from getting what they need, is all that matters.

562
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:50,230
Speaker 1: Because no one sub-optimally manages the farm, the farm is perfectly optimized by every player, the bidding becomes the last bastion of skill.

563
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,709
Speaker 1: So, game's fun.

564
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,541
Speaker 1: It's a great game to have.

565
00:28:55,641 --> 00:29:04,108
Speaker 1: if you commonly run board game nights, because you can whip it out, teach it to smart people really quickly, and play the game for, it takes like an hour to play.

566
00:29:04,913 --> 00:29:06,109
Speaker 1: Unless someone doesn't take their turn.

567
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:20,530
Speaker 1: But despite all these crazy combinations of trades I could do, I could calculate them very quickly, just by the nature of the chits, limiting the number of trades you can do, it sort of cuts off that tree that you have to explore to figure out the optimal path really quickly.

568
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,448
Speaker 1: It sort of truncates the total amount of mental effort you could spend.

569
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:27,689
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's it, it's a fun game.

570
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:36,910
Speaker 0: Alright, so the game I played was Tammany Hall, which is a game that I had heard about and kind of wanted to play, just based on theme alone.

571
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,510
Speaker 0: I did not know anything about the game at all.

572
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:48,230
Speaker 0: The rulebook had really tiny font, but it was only like a few pages, and I read it really quickly and understood all the rules with no help really quickly, and I'm pretty sure I didn't get anything wrong.

573
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:53,250
Speaker 0: And then, I played the game, and I was very surprised at this game.

574
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:56,110
Speaker 0: The way it works is it's similar to El Grande, right?

575
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,750
Speaker 0: It's territory controlled, right?

576
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,949
Speaker 0: Or, what's that actually called?

577
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:02,550
Speaker 0: It's Colonel Blotto.

578
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:08,529
Speaker 0: You put guys into the different wards, districts of Manhattan, trying to win elections in the different, right?

579
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:14,750
Speaker 0: To get, I guess, seats in the city council or whatever it is, and then whoever's got the most is the mayor and whatnot.

580
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:18,210
Speaker 1: Alright, so a little bit of Blotto, a little bit of democracy going on.

581
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:27,990
Speaker 0: and really, I read all the rules, but all you do on most of your turns is you either, A, put two bosses onto the board.

582
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,770
Speaker 0: You can put them anywhere.

583
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,449
Speaker 0: You put them in the same place, two different places.

584
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,985
Speaker 1: -So, Caballeros, like in El Grande.

585
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:32,429
Speaker 0: -Exactly.

586
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,329
Speaker 0: You can put two guys anywhere you want, or you can put one guy.

587
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:45,789
Speaker 0: So, no matter what, every turn, you're putting at least one boss out and take an immigrant from the boat, basically, and put them somewhere, right?

588
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:53,850
Speaker 0: So, it's either two bosses or a boss and an immigrant, and there's four kinds of immigrants -- Germans, English, Italians, and Irish.

589
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,929
Speaker 1: So, we can get some casual racism in there, too.

590
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,729
Speaker 0: There's super racism, okay?

591
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:04,830
Speaker 0: So, basically, all the spaces also already have one immigrant in them to begin with.

592
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,250
Speaker 0: There's also one space that's Tammany Hall.

593
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:13,990
Speaker 0: that's worth, like, one bonus point, and the four first spaces have a bonus to them, as well.

594
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,009
Speaker 0: So, here's how it works.

595
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:18,890
Speaker 0: The game is in four terms of four years each.

596
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:20,328
Speaker 0: Each turn is a year.

597
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:24,310
Speaker 0: So, you go around four times, right, for the four years.

598
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:25,810
Speaker 0: Then you have an election.

599
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:30,469
Speaker 0: Then you go four years, election, four years, election, four years, election, game over, high score wins, okay?

600
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,213
Speaker 0: -All right.

601
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:41,190
Speaker 0: -So, you put your bosses out, and, really, in the first four years, you don't have any political favors to start with, at least not that I could tell.

602
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,330
Speaker 0: I looked all over the rule book.

603
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:54,127
Speaker 0: You start with no favors, which means all that really matters are bosses and whoever has the most bosses in a space wins that space, and there's really nothing you can do about it.

604
00:31:55,211 --> 00:32:01,650
Speaker 0: So, that first four years is just putting bosses out, mostly, right, and it's like, think about it.

605
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,885
Speaker 0: Every space on the board starts empty, right?

606
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,670
Speaker 1: So, it's that opening risk of, "I'm placing my guy here.

607
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,525
Speaker 1: I'm placing my guy

608
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:08,770
Speaker 1: here.".

609
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:13,509
Speaker 0: You put a guy, someone else puts a guy, right, and it's like, "Ooh, who's gonna...".

610
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:23,869
Speaker 0: You know, it's like everyone is basically going to put eight or fewer guys out, but between four and eight guys on the board, right, and who's gonna win each space?

611
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,418
Speaker 0: I don't know.

612
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:25,810
Speaker 0: Right?

613
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,129
Speaker 0: So, that's actually kind of interesting.

614
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:36,690
Speaker 0: Just everyone can put in most two guys, see who wins each space, and if everyone's smart, I guess it should turn out relatively equally.

615
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,930
Speaker 1: It should be 100% predictable assuming everyone's smart.

616
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,970
Speaker 0: It's rough because you could also put out an immigrant, right?

617
00:32:43,193 --> 00:32:44,610
Speaker 1: Ah, the immigrants.

618
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,670
Speaker 0: Right, so, here's how it works.

619
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,970
Speaker 0: You do the election, and you go in order.

620
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,750
Speaker 0: The order is written on the board, and if you win a spot, right?

621
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,210
Speaker 0: If I win an election in a spot, I get the most bosses.

622
00:32:58,211 --> 00:33:01,390
Speaker 0: Every boss is kicked out except for one of my bosses.

623
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:05,350
Speaker 0: Even my other bosses are kicked out, just cleaned house.

624
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,950
Speaker 0: If there's a tie, every boss is removed.

625
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,969
Speaker 0: No one wins that spot.

626
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,930
Speaker 0: Just clean it out, right?

627
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:12,749
Speaker 0: So, it's rough.

628
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,969
Speaker 0: Every time you win a spot, you get a victory point.

629
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:16,528
Speaker 0: Hooray!

630
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:19,250
Speaker 0: If you win Tammany Hall 2 victory point, yay!

631
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,389
Speaker 0: You keep going around in the order doing this.

632
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:30,109
Speaker 0: The first two spots on the board, if you win one of those, you get to put an immigrant on the board during the election, which is powerful.

633
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:39,290
Speaker 0: Then, during the third and fourth spots on the board, if you win those, you can take one political favor of any color of your choice.

634
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,949
Speaker 0: Now, the political favors are discs that are colors that match the immigrants.

635
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:52,089
Speaker 0: So, what happens with those is if there's currently an election in a spot, let's say there's an election on Tammany Hall, right?

636
00:33:52,773 --> 00:33:54,949
Speaker 0: And I got two bosses, you got one boss.

637
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:57,230
Speaker 0: There's an Irish immigrant there.

638
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,509
Speaker 0: That's the only immigrant that's there, which means only Irish favors will work.

639
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,041
Speaker 0: We do, right?

640
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,889
Speaker 0: Normally, it's just two to one, I win, right?

641
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:08,190
Speaker 0: But what if you have an Irish favor?

642
00:34:08,732 --> 00:34:12,670
Speaker 0: You can use that favor in a closed fist bid, right?

643
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:22,090
Speaker 0: Where you both reveal before the election how many favors we possess that could be used on this election in this district, right?

644
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:29,409
Speaker 0: Then, we put out a closed fist with between zero and the maximum number of favors we could use, and then reveal.

645
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:34,149
Speaker 0: And any favors we spend basically count as a vote, just like a boss counts as a vote.

646
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:34,719
Speaker 0: Oh.

647
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:39,929
Speaker 0: Even if you lose that election, you still spend any favors.

648
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,069
Speaker 0: You still called in your favors, you just didn't win.

649
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,530
Speaker 0: So, anything you put in your fist is gone.

650
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,050
Speaker 0: Totally gone, right?

651
00:34:48,757 --> 00:34:49,829
Speaker 1: You know what game does that too?

652
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,605
Speaker 1: Dune.

653
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

654
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,824
Speaker 1: You bid troops, but you lose the troops.

655
00:34:53,846 --> 00:34:55,090
Speaker 1: you bid, whether or not you win.

656
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,409
Speaker 0: Same thing, right?

657
00:34:57,533 --> 00:35:02,090
Speaker 0: And then, if there's a tie, you both lose everything and you lose all the bosses that are there, right?

658
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:09,245
Speaker 0: No matter what, at the end of that election, there's either going to be zero bosses or one boss left in the spot with all the immigrant cubes, and that's it.

659
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:12,370
Speaker 0: And someone will score the one victory point for that spot.

660
00:35:12,912 --> 00:35:16,750
Speaker 1: I can just hear that I overheard that Emily apparently kept arresting the Italians.

661
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:18,089
Speaker 0: Right, so I'm getting to that.

662
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,148
Speaker 0: Here comes the good parts.

663
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:24,570
Speaker 0: So, you finish all the elections, everyone gets their points and whatever, or maybe bonus favors or cubes, whatever.

664
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,330
Speaker 0: Then, you see, well, who's still on the board with a boss, right?

665
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,790
Speaker 0: So, let's say I still have three districts.

666
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:35,949
Speaker 0: In those districts, there's two English people and an Italian person.

667
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,350
Speaker 0: Does anyone have more than two English people?

668
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:39,167
Speaker 0: No.

669
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:40,990
Speaker 0: I am the king of the English people.

670
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,310
Speaker 0: Boom, I get three English favors, right?

671
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,950
Speaker 0: And you do, so the one person is going to be the boss, basically, of each of the, right?

672
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,430
Speaker 0: So, I could be the boss of the English people and of the Germans.

673
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:54,029
Speaker 0: It's possible, right?

674
00:35:54,350 --> 00:36:00,590
Speaker 0: Because it's how many total immigrant cubes are in the districts that you won elections for, right?

675
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,949
Speaker 0: You'll get the support of them and get favors from them.

676
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:04,290
Speaker 0: There could even be a tie.

677
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,370
Speaker 0: If there's a tie, let's say I have two Germans total and you have two Germans total.

678
00:36:07,873 --> 00:36:09,410
Speaker 0: We both get three German favors.

679
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,107
Speaker 0: No one else does.

680
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,234
Speaker 1: No.

681
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:11,330
Speaker 0: Right?

682
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:14,050
Speaker 0: And now, you've got a fist full of favors.

683
00:36:14,432 --> 00:36:16,126
Speaker 0: So, the next election gets crazy.

684
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:24,350
Speaker 0: go nuts because I could have like one boss in a district and as long as that district has a German cube, I have like three German favors.

685
00:36:24,472 --> 00:36:26,990
Speaker 0: I could put my fist out and that could be like three bosses' worth.

686
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,449
Speaker 0: You don't know, right?

687
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:35,870
Speaker 0: So, suddenly, putting a boss down in a place that has a cube that matches the color of the favors you have is really, really strong.

688
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,910
Speaker 0: Putting it in a place where it doesn't have that cube of the favors that you have is really, really weak, right?

689
00:36:42,712 --> 00:36:47,970
Speaker 0: Now, whoever wins the most elections and there's a bunch of tie breakers is the mayor.

690
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:50,569
Speaker 0: The mayor gets three victory points.

691
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:51,687
Speaker 0: Pretty good.

692
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,910
Speaker 0: But, but, the mayor doesn't get any special powers whatsoever.

693
00:36:56,712 --> 00:37:00,450
Speaker 0: The mayor assigns these three special powers to the other players.

694
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,209
Speaker 0: Four special powers to the other players.

695
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:10,430
Speaker 0: The special powers are all ridiculously strong and the mayor is very sad that he does not have one of these powers.

696
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,210
Speaker 0: The mayor also goes first, which sucks.

697
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:17,250
Speaker 0: You want to go last, so you can see where other people have put their shit and then counter.

698
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:20,510
Speaker 0: If you have to go first, you're basically just getting fucked as the mayor.

699
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:23,090
Speaker 0: The only good thing about being mayor is three victory points.

700
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:25,009
Speaker 0: Everything else sucks ass.

701
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:26,609
Speaker 1: It's kind of like being the king of Tokyo.

702
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:34,930
Speaker 0: Right, so the four powers are, and basically you use your power every single turn right before you put your guys out, right?

703
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:37,390
Speaker 0: So, the first power is chief of police.

704
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,610
Speaker 0: You pick an immigrant on the board and you lock him in jail.

705
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,749
Speaker 0: Basically, you remove him from the board.

706
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:45,929
Speaker 0: But, you can't completely empty a space of its last cube, right?

707
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:59,069
Speaker 0: So, you might want to, like, if there's a spot you're trying to fight for and there's a German cube and an Italian cube and you have a lot of German favors, remove that Italian cube, so no one who's fighting over it with you can use their Italian favors on it, right?

708
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:02,909
Speaker 0: A second power is to move a cube.

709
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:07,647
Speaker 0: Similar to the police, you can't remove the last cube from a space, but you can move a cube.

710
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:15,210
Speaker 0: So, if someone drops, like, an Italian cube on the board somewhere else and you have Italian favors, just move that cube on over into your space.

711
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:20,490
Speaker 0: Or, someone drops a cube into a space you're fighting for, hoping that they'll be able to use their favors.

712
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:22,370
Speaker 0: Just move it on out into some other space.

713
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,690
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter, right?

714
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:24,647
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh, take

715
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:24,789
Speaker 0: that.".

716
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:35,805
Speaker 0: Or, maybe there's a spot you're guaranteed to win, move a bunch of cubes into it, so now maybe you can win the favors of more immigrants at the end of the year, right, during the election, because you're going to win that space no matter what.

717
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:41,349
Speaker 0: The other two powers are... Let me try to remember.

718
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:43,908
Speaker 0: Why am I not remembering right now?

719
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:45,328
Speaker 1: Because you played the game once.

720
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:46,949
Speaker 0: That's probably why, yeah.

721
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,010
Speaker 1: During the middle of a long party.

722
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:49,769
Speaker 0: Oh, I remember.

723
00:38:50,211 --> 00:38:55,710
Speaker 0: One of the powers is, at the beginning of your turn, you just get a favor of any color you want.

724
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:59,029
Speaker 0: So, basically, you're going to get four favors because there's four years.

725
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,630
Speaker 0: So, basically, the power is four favors any color you want.

726
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,389
Speaker 0: Pretty strong.

727
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:06,629
Speaker 0: And the final power is the lockup.

728
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:13,610
Speaker 0: So, what the lockup does is, before you place guys out and take your turn, you have these two silver tokens.

729
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,430
Speaker 0: So, you can only use it twice during the whole year, right?

730
00:39:16,873 --> 00:39:18,689
Speaker 0: So, two years of the term you can use it.

731
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:24,830
Speaker 0: And when you put a silver token in a space, that space is locked in until the end of the election.

732
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,890
Speaker 0: So, like, you have one guy on a space with some immigrants.

733
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,630
Speaker 0: Just put the silver token on it.

734
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,350
Speaker 0: No one can put any immigrants there, remove immigrants from there.

735
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,810
Speaker 0: It's like you can't touch it no matter what.

736
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,090
Speaker 1: Basically sticking a king there.

737
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:40,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you have two kings you can put out twice during this whole term, right?

738
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,669
Speaker 0: So, you're going to basically win no matter what two spaces, unless you're really dumb.

739
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:46,249
Speaker 0: So, those are the four powers.

740
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,929
Speaker 0: That's why the mayor gets fucked.

741
00:39:49,172 --> 00:39:50,330
Speaker 0: And then that's pretty much the whole game.

742
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:54,150
Speaker 0: is you just do three more terms like that, right?

743
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:56,830
Speaker 0: And at the end, who has the most victory points?

744
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:05,130
Speaker 0: I won by a hair because of one more mechanic I didn't mention, and it's the best mechanic, the slander.

745
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:09,170
Speaker 0: At the beginning of the game, you get three slander tokens, right?

746
00:40:09,753 --> 00:40:13,429
Speaker 0: And you can use these slander tokens to remove bosses from the board.

747
00:40:14,191 --> 00:40:18,410
Speaker 0: In order to remove a boss from the board, you have to spend one of your three slander tokens.

748
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:23,550
Speaker 0: You can only use one per term starting in the second term, so at most you can use all three of them, right?

749
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,369
Speaker 0: And you can't use more than one per election, and you can't use any in the first election.

750
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,918
Speaker 0: You spend a slander token, and you have to spend a favor of an immigrant color.

751
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:35,850
Speaker 0: that immigrant is in the space you're trying to slander.

752
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:41,230
Speaker 0: You also have to have a boss in that space, which is really hard to set up the slander, right?

753
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,150
Speaker 0: It's like this really difficult thing to make happen.

754
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:48,890
Speaker 0: But let's say I'm in a space with an Italian immigrant, and you're in the space also with a boss.

755
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:54,170
Speaker 0: I can remove your boss by spending a slander token and an Italian favor, right?

756
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,590
Speaker 0: Because basically I slander you amongst the Italians, right?

757
00:40:58,033 --> 00:40:59,950
Speaker 0: And then your boss gets kicked out of that district.

758
00:41:00,455 --> 00:41:01,090
Speaker 0: Really strong.

759
00:41:01,311 --> 00:41:04,190
Speaker 1: I'm already just married to the idea of a game that has a slander face.

760
00:41:04,451 --> 00:41:04,929
Speaker 0: I know, right?

761
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:11,288
Speaker 0: Then the slander is after you put your guys out also, so you can put a boss and then slander the space you just put a boss on.

762
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:23,430
Speaker 0: Then you can spread the slander to an adjacent space, but that's even harder to set up, because that adjacent space would also have to have that same color of immigrant, Italian immigrants.

763
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:27,210
Speaker 0: And it would also have to be against the same opponent.

764
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:46,890
Speaker 0: So that means you, the person I'm attacking, would have to have bosses that are adjacent in two adjacent spaces, and they would have to be the same color of immigrant in both of those spaces, and I would have to have a boss in one of those spaces, and I would have to use a slander token, spend one favor for the first space, and two more favors for the second space.

765
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,150
Speaker 0: So a total of three favors, a slander token.

766
00:41:50,213 --> 00:42:02,518
Speaker 0: It's this incredibly difficult thing to happen to do the double slander, but when it happens, you freaking remove-- You remove two of your opponent's bosses from the board, one in each space, which is really strong.

767
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:04,150
Speaker 0: if they only had one boss in each, right?

768
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,890
Speaker 0: You basically just canceled one of their turns.

769
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,009
Speaker 0: Really nasty.

770
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:16,270
Speaker 0: But if you don't use your slander tokens at all, every slander token at the end of the game is worth one victory point, which is big.

771
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,450
Speaker 1: So you just didn't use yours?

772
00:42:18,173 --> 00:42:25,149
Speaker 0: I only used one, and at the end of the game, I was losing by one because I was mayor twice, which sucked ass.

773
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,430
Speaker 0: But being mayor twice, I got six points, right?

774
00:42:28,732 --> 00:42:29,367
Speaker 0: So that wasn't bad.

775
00:42:30,192 --> 00:42:36,070
Speaker 0: And then I had two slander tokens, one, two, and I-- oh, I win because everyone else pretty much used Max Slander.

776
00:42:37,591 --> 00:42:43,010
Speaker 0: This game, I don't know how good it is in the long run because I've only played it once.

777
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:44,550
Speaker 0: I feel like it could go either way.

778
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:54,130
Speaker 0: It could be just awesome forever, or it could be that you sort of figure it out after a few plays, and everyone sort of, you know, falls into doing the same thing.

779
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:58,588
Speaker 0: But I do know that I really want to play it again, especially with Rym.

780
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:06,930
Speaker 1: Well, Scott and Emily both told me, and even Alex mentioned later, that game's kind of your kind of game, Rym.

781
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:10,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is this super, like, this is a game.

782
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:21,267
Speaker 1: It's almost sort of like-- I like games that have area control, that have cubes in places on a board, that have a map, that have Colonel Blotto, that have direct competition.

783
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:26,330
Speaker 0: The game is actually a lot like diplomacy, only much smaller and faster, right?

784
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:34,149
Speaker 0: It even says, like, in the instructions, like, you can de-wheel and deal and bargain and do whatever, you know, that you're not held to anything.

785
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:41,690
Speaker 0: But it suggests that you, you know, it's basically super, super political, like, listen, Rym, don't go here, and I won't go there, sort of stuff.

786
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:45,510
Speaker 0: And then we both do the exact opposite of what we said, and then-- No one did any of that.

787
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:49,750
Speaker 0: Everyone who was playing was sort of like, just like, yeah, I'm just going to be quiet and play, right?

788
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,610
Speaker 0: I'm not going to bother with that political nonsense.

789
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:52,889
Speaker 0: That's not going to work out.

790
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:55,189
Speaker 1: So, are there any rules around that?

791
00:43:56,413 --> 00:43:57,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not held to anything.

792
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,510
Speaker 0: It just suggests that you-- Can I leave the table and have a discussion, then return?

793
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,150
Speaker 0: The rule book, yeah, the rule book just suggests that you be political, basically.

794
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,077
Speaker 0: Okay, okay.

795
00:44:05,117 --> 00:44:08,150
Speaker 0: It doesn't, actually, there's no enforcement of politics.

796
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:12,410
Speaker 1: With Homesteaders, there was one note in the rules that I found fascinating.

797
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:24,706
Speaker 1: It said, "All turns, other than the bidding process, are simultaneous unless someone is a bitch and cares, in which case it goes in clockwise from starting

798
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:25,029
Speaker 1: player.".

799
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:29,114
Speaker 1: So, basically, play unless someone wants to be that guy.

800
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:35,456
Speaker 1: And what was funny is that we start to play and then Chris is teaching the game, he's like, "Alright, everybody can

801
00:44:35,497 --> 00:44:35,618
Speaker 1: go.".

802
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,722
Speaker 1: And I was like, "I choose to wait until everyone takes the

803
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:37,945
Speaker 1: turn.".

804
00:44:37,986 --> 00:44:43,862
Speaker 1: And he goes, "Alright, the rules say that if someone says that, then we have to go in order like

805
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:44,065
Speaker 1: this.".

806
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,710
Speaker 1: It had the rim rule, the rim clause.

807
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,224
Speaker 0: Did it matter?

808
00:44:48,345 --> 00:44:49,678
Speaker 1: No, it didn't fucking matter at all.

809
00:44:50,002 --> 00:44:52,730
Speaker 0: Oh, if the turn order mattered, I would-- Like, hell, it could matter.

810
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:54,384
Speaker 1: It could matter.

811
00:44:54,404 --> 00:44:55,679
Speaker 1: What if there's only one of a building?

812
00:44:56,124 --> 00:44:56,770
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah.

813
00:44:57,012 --> 00:44:57,900
Speaker 1: So it could matter.

814
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,758
Speaker 1: It just didn't happen to matter.

815
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:08,345
Speaker 0: But if there's only one of a building, right, maybe and I'm later in the turn order, I'm better off just, like, simultaneously going to buy that building, right?

816
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:09,576
Speaker 1: But the other guy might say, "No, I was gonna buy

817
00:45:09,617 --> 00:45:09,657
Speaker 1: it.".

818
00:45:10,972 --> 00:45:11,880
Speaker 0: I already bought it too late.

819
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,889
Speaker 0: No, that's not how it works.

820
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,214
Speaker 0: You had to say turn order before I bought it.

821
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:16,385
Speaker 1: No, it's not how it works.

822
00:45:16,446 --> 00:45:20,570
Speaker 1: If there is any race condition, then precedence goes clockwise.

823
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,029
Speaker 0: So then we have to basically undo what we did and then-- Well, you just don't do it.

824
00:45:24,913 --> 00:45:26,090
Speaker 1: How far-- Are you the Flash?

825
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:30,697
Speaker 1: Have you already, like, taken it, spent your money, don't remember what you spent, put it in front of you?

826
00:45:31,626 --> 00:45:32,869
Speaker 1: I don't think you can move that quickly.

827
00:45:33,951 --> 00:45:34,233
Speaker 0: Bam.

828
00:45:34,658 --> 00:45:38,676
Speaker 0: I mean, if there's simultaneous turns, I'm just at the beginning of the turn, like, "Bam, take the

829
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:39,606
Speaker 0: building.".

830
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:49,910
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was straight Tammany Hall of Strange and, like, you read the rules and it's, like, all this stuff, but then when you actually play, most turns just put two guys, put two guys, put two guys, right?

831
00:45:49,971 --> 00:45:56,493
Speaker 0: And it's so simple, but all this stuff came out of it, and it's interesting, like, El Grande, you're putting Calvieros on the board, right?

832
00:45:56,655 --> 00:46:02,310
Speaker 0: It's similar, but in El Grande, each space has a predetermined value, right?

833
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:09,649
Speaker 0: In Tammany Hall, some of the spaces have a predetermined increased value, but most of the spaces are just worth a point.

834
00:46:10,272 --> 00:46:21,180
Speaker 0: But you also put the immigrants out, which increases the value of the spaces, right, so that you can actually modify the values of the spaces that you're fighting over while you're fighting over them.

835
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,958
Speaker 0: You know what other game did that, actually?

836
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:24,647
Speaker 1: Remember Tikal.

837
00:46:26,956 --> 00:46:28,997
Speaker 1: You go into the jungle and you dig up the pyramids,

838
00:46:29,017 --> 00:46:29,340
Speaker 0: so you

839
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:43,785
Speaker 1: can, whoever has the most guys in a spot wins those points when there's a scoring round, but you can, anyone who's in the space can spend points, or spend money, or spend actions to dig and make the space more valuable.

840
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:47,328
Speaker 1: You can make a space more valuable independent of controlling that space.

841
00:46:48,217 --> 00:46:49,670
Speaker 0: But you can also make it less valuable.

842
00:46:50,817 --> 00:47:07,894
Speaker 0: On top of that, when you modify the immigrants, not only are you changing the value of winning that space, because there's more immigrants there, but you are also making it easier or harder for different players to capture that space because the immigrants that they have favors with may or may not be present in that space.

843
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:23,469
Speaker 0: When I was basically, I just took Germans and I went all in Germans the whole game, and basically no one could contest me in a German space, really, unless they got some other immigrant in there, which sometimes they were able to do because I was the mayor and they had a special power and they would move an immigrant in and move my German out, right?

844
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:24,054
Speaker 0: Stuff like that.

845
00:47:24,478 --> 00:47:26,458
Speaker 0: But I just stuck with one the whole time.

846
00:47:26,478 --> 00:47:39,044
Speaker 0: I think a couple times Emily had favors of two different immigrants, and the ton of favors, so many favors made it really hard to beat her in any kind of election if those immigrants were there, especially if both kinds were there, right?

847
00:47:39,105 --> 00:47:47,230
Speaker 0: You end up just bidding zero and forcing them to bid some amount and waste some of their favors when they didn't need to, right?

848
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:47,876
Speaker 0: Alright.

849
00:47:48,503 --> 00:47:53,247
Speaker 0: And yeah, but you could also be like, you know, get into a little poison cup there, right?

850
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:56,033
Speaker 0: It's like, "They know I'm going to bid zero because I can't possibly win.

851
00:47:56,074 --> 00:48:03,852
Speaker 0: I'm not going to waste my favors on this, but I'll bid one because that way they'll probably bid zero thinking they can save them and not waste them.

852
00:48:04,135 --> 00:48:04,822
Speaker 1: Oh, we tied!

853
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:06,315
Speaker 0: Clear out

854
00:48:06,355 --> 00:48:06,780
Speaker 0: everything!".

855
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:13,222
Speaker 1: In the end, this sounds almost like a more political, more interactive version of El Grande.

856
00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:17,242
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's super, but it's also really faster, simpler.

857
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:18,109
Speaker 0: It doesn't have the cards.

858
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:18,471
Speaker 0: What?

859
00:48:18,491 --> 00:48:20,050
Speaker 1: El Grande is really fast and simple.

860
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:20,999
Speaker 1: You just haven't played it recently.

861
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:22,898
Speaker 0: It doesn't have the cards where you choose at the bottom.

862
00:48:22,939 --> 00:48:26,232
Speaker 0: It doesn't have the bidding cards for the turn order and the number of caballeros.

863
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:27,505
Speaker 1: Well, because they're not the same game.

864
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:28,413
Speaker 0: It's just flat.

865
00:48:28,454 --> 00:48:30,129
Speaker 0: It's just two, two, two, two, two.

866
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:31,470
Speaker 0: Or one and an immigrant.

867
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:32,272
Speaker 0: That's it.

868
00:48:32,554 --> 00:48:32,755
Speaker 1: Yep.

869
00:48:32,775 --> 00:48:37,589
Speaker 1: I want to play more games, but these two games are pretty good.

870
00:48:38,211 --> 00:48:40,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely want to play it again.

871
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,123
Speaker 0: After I play it again, we'll see if I want to play it again again.

872
00:48:43,143 --> 00:48:43,325
Speaker 0: I might

873
00:48:43,345 --> 00:48:58,034
Speaker 1: pick up a copy of Homesteaders just because it's another game that's great to teach people these concepts and it's so quick to teach and play for the kind of game that it is, that if I got someone to play Homesteaders first, they would have no trouble with Agricola and Kalis.

874
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:00,699
Speaker 1: Like, it's a good stepping stone game.

875
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:08,274
Speaker 1: If I play it a few more times and it lives up, I might add it to my sort of short list of recommendations for people who are new into German-style gaming.

876
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:11,150
Speaker 0: Alright, well Tammany Hall's 80 bucks on Amazon, so not buying that.

877
00:49:12,172 --> 00:49:17,054
Speaker 1: Dude, that out of print La Chita that I bought was only 70.

878
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:21,209
Speaker 0: I think this is, I think I could just make a game similar to Tammany Hall really simply.

879
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:22,956
Speaker 0: Right?

880
00:49:23,058 --> 00:49:24,818
Speaker 0: And then not have to pay 80 bucks for it.

881
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:29,264
Speaker 1: So, like when we made that ghetto pirated copy of Liar's Dice on a piece of paper?

882
00:49:29,426 --> 00:49:29,710
Speaker 0: Exactly.

883
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:30,270
Speaker 1: Yeah.

884
00:49:35,991 --> 00:49:38,213
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rym and Scott.
