1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,627
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday December 12th.

2
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:14,537
Speaker 0: I'm rim and I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:20,559
Speaker 0: tonight We talk a bit about the virtual console on the Nintendo Wii and more importantly ice hockey for the NES.

4
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:28,855
Speaker 0: Let's do this Man, I got to say the fact that it's December 12th, and I still don't need to wear a coat to work.

5
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:35,114
Speaker 1: I wore a coat To work a couple weeks ago, but today I just carried it around with me.

6
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:35,837
Speaker 0: It was 55 and sunny.

7
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:39,892
Speaker 1: It wasn't sunny where I was it was just gray all the time really.

8
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:43,305
Speaker 0: it was actually sunny down in Yonkers all day Everywhere I go.

9
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:46,560
Speaker 1: it's gray, but it's not cold definitely not cold.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:54,219
Speaker 0: Well, the best thing is I looked at the forecast and not only is it gonna be sunny pretty much all week But it's supposed to get sunnier and warmer this weekend.

11
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:56,604
Speaker 1: They might be lying.

12
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:57,407
Speaker 0: I don't know.

13
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:58,370
Speaker 0: I don't think any.

14
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:01,038
Speaker 0: as far as I'm concerned winter doesn't exist anymore.

15
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:01,660
Speaker 0: It's not gonna happen.

16
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,879
Speaker 0: It hasn't snowed here, and it's not gonna.

17
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:13,130
Speaker 0: It's gonna stay 55 and sunny right up until May when it's suddenly gonna be 95 and humid again Yeah, and then we'll have snow in July instead now.

18
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:14,756
Speaker 0: It'll just never snow again.

19
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:15,760
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna snow.

20
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:18,349
Speaker 0: I'm absolutely certain it won't and in fact.

21
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:21,500
Speaker 0: I'm willing to put up absolutely nothing to back that argument up.

22
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,225
Speaker 1: What a great bet.

23
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:24,973
Speaker 1: that just shows how sure you are like.

24
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:26,119
Speaker 0: I'll bet a negative cent.

25
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:28,085
Speaker 0: no no I'll bet you a thousand space dollars.

26
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:29,107
Speaker 1: Oh great.

27
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:30,391
Speaker 1: That's worth so much.

28
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,620
Speaker 0: thousand space dollars is worth like negative a hundred real dollars.

29
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

30
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's not too good in space.

31
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:43,052
Speaker 1: They got too much inflation The expanding universe and all that was.

32
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:46,651
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if that was funny or lame I don't know either, but I laughed.

33
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,898
Speaker 0: so I guess you win, okay?

34
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:49,082
Speaker 0: Right?

35
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:54,260
Speaker 0: so in the video gaming news because there really isn't so much useful video gaming news lately.

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,722
Speaker 0: I mean stuff.

37
00:01:54,762 --> 00:01:55,787
Speaker 0: We really want to talk about.

38
00:01:55,827 --> 00:02:01,131
Speaker 0: we can talk for my video game news and my video game news But there's a bunch of little things that really aren't like.

39
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:06,340
Speaker 0: there's a story that the ps3 is Not really selling for much on eBay anymore.

40
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,398
Speaker 0: There's a lot of them out there yet the Wii is selling out and going for just as much money.

41
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:11,547
Speaker 1: Whatever.

42
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,060
Speaker 0: yeah, there's all those stories.

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,760
Speaker 0: But now the one I want to talk about is something that Takes me off on a number of levels and it's relevant compared to what we talked about yesterday.

44
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:34,920
Speaker 0: You see valve and it's infinite wisdom according to numerous sources has decided that they're going to put advertisements in counter-strike 1.6 and then in the future they're going to put these same advertisements in counter-strike source.

45
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:42,939
Speaker 0: They're going to have them on blank walls in the game on the scoring screen and in the letterboxed areas in spectator mode.

46
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,020
Speaker 0: They're gonna be dynamic.

47
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:51,242
Speaker 0: They talk more in detail about how they're gonna be dynamic and all that And they didn't really answer a lot of the questions I have.

48
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,370
Speaker 0: as to you know how the ads are going to be served?

49
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,760
Speaker 0: aka can I block them with a hosts file?

50
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, or you know, but what they're hot just exactly how they're gonna do this.

51
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,940
Speaker 0: Are they gonna let the ads be deformed in game?

52
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,479
Speaker 0: Because then I would totally just spray-paint pornography over any ads I saw.

53
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:16,600
Speaker 0: But if they don't let them be deformed and that really kind of takes away from the game It does, you know, it's really kind of weird because counter-strike has always been this free game.

54
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,432
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's made it a huge game in the first place.

55
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:20,235
Speaker 1: And what is it still?

56
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:21,300
Speaker 1: the number one online game?

57
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,722
Speaker 1: I don't know.

58
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:26,040
Speaker 0: I think it's fallen from number one recently, but not that long ago.

59
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:29,194
Speaker 1: There still had to be tens of thousands of people playing counter-strike.

60
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:30,259
Speaker 1: I can't believe that there aren't.

61
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,540
Speaker 0: Oh if you if you add up counter-strike and counter-strike source together, it still has a lot of players.

62
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:38,453
Speaker 0: It has I'd say in terms of numbers of people.

63
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:43,699
Speaker 0: over time counter-strike has been One of the greatest runs in the history of a popular online FPS.

64
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:47,760
Speaker 1: Well, I think what it comes down to is the counter-strike has always been a free game.

65
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,880
Speaker 1: So everyone no one's willing to pay money for counter-strike.

66
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,580
Speaker 0: A lot of people did buy just counter-strike because they were dumb.

67
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:56,190
Speaker 0: Well, they didn't realize that you could go to the bargain bin.

68
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:58,700
Speaker 1: Well, you buy half-life half-life worth money.

69
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,200
Speaker 0: Well, you could buy half-life for like five bucks right before they start because they counter-strike used to just be a mod for half-life.

70
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:07,159
Speaker 0: You had to buy half-life and then counter-strike and all those other mods were free.

71
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:14,447
Speaker 0: Then half-life hadn't been sold for a long time, you know, it came out like these platinum collections and whatever But it wasn't an expensive game anymore.

72
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,856
Speaker 0: They decided to sell for like 29 bucks.

73
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:22,895
Speaker 0: Maybe it was less than that counter-strike in a box and it was brother bought that it was.

74
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,244
Speaker 1: it was the worst because they changed The weapon names.

75
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:26,692
Speaker 0: Well, yeah among other things.

76
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:27,516
Speaker 0: It was the weapon.

77
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:28,320
Speaker 1: names are still chain.

78
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:37,572
Speaker 0: It was just counter-strike and people bought that because they didn't realize that you could buy half-life Which includes counter-strike and every other mod ever for like five bucks.

79
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:39,538
Speaker 0: if that you could find it for free.

80
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,255
Speaker 0: usually Mmm, just go to someone's house and take it.

81
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:42,959
Speaker 0: They weren't playing it.

82
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:48,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the worst thing was if you paid $30 for counter-strike, you didn't get half-life you couldn't.

83
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:49,499
Speaker 1: it was like oh shit.

84
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:54,396
Speaker 0: So I can pay five bucks for half-life and counter-strike or I can pay 30 bucks for counter-strike.

85
00:04:54,838 --> 00:04:58,520
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, shitty your counter-strike than the real one - but it didn't really matter.

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,346
Speaker 0: I mean counter-strike was Rampantly popular for reasons.

87
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:05,080
Speaker 0: We don't really need to get into until we eventually do a show on counter-strike.

88
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,045
Speaker 1: Oh, we should do that.

89
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:06,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should.

90
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:19,179
Speaker 0: I had a lot to say about that game The good and the bad and hilarious most of the hilarious But the what bothers me and here's the real issue the fact that they're trying to put advertisements in this game.

91
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:27,759
Speaker 0: While it annoys me and bothers me and it would it's a big reason that I might not ever bother playing counter-strike again Even though it used to be one of my favorite games.

92
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:28,427
Speaker 0: I'm just.

93
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:33,895
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna deal with Advertisements that I can't get rid of in a game that I paid for or got for free.

94
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:37,880
Speaker 0: if I didn't pirate it Now if I'd pirated the game, I might feel bad about it.

95
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,198
Speaker 0: But now they gave it away free and now they're changing it on me.

96
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:46,700
Speaker 0: What bothers me is that it's the same thing that happened with tribes - valve owns the game.

97
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:47,945
Speaker 0: They give it away for free.

98
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:54,940
Speaker 0: They sell it whatever but in order to play the game online They make you authenticate with these servers that they control that no one else can run.

99
00:05:55,421 --> 00:06:05,399
Speaker 0: They effectively hold over me the power to just deny me access to this game at any time or Change it and not give me the option to unchange it or just take it away forever.

100
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:07,352
Speaker 0: Tribes the same thing happened.

101
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:08,560
Speaker 0: The game was taken away.

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,555
Speaker 0: You can't get CD keys anymore without a lot of hacking and various shenanigans.

103
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:18,099
Speaker 0: You cannot play tribes - online Even if you bought it in many cases

104
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:19,024
Speaker 1: Mmm,

105
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:32,260
Speaker 0: and the fact that they can change the game and put these ads in Despite the fact that the servers they provide don't really do anything And in fact the actual servers you pay on play on are provided by people like us running them in our houses.

106
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:36,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like on the one hand I can see the need for the ads in that.

107
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:39,137
Speaker 1: All right Counter-Strike is a game That's always been free.

108
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:46,160
Speaker 1: They have they run a lot of expensive powerful computers and they have a lot of developers working on it over time.

109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,228
Speaker 1: You know all all the time to improve upon this free game just because it's so popular And yet they make nothing off of it.

110
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:53,730
Speaker 1: Basically.

111
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:58,533
Speaker 0: Yeah, except that other mods that were just as good Also made nothing or almost nothing.

112
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,101
Speaker 0: It didn't have to resort to this y'all.

113
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:05,798
Speaker 1: those develop because those mods were things developers made in order to get real jobs.

114
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,640
Speaker 1: and now Valve hired them all and is paying the money.

115
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:16,812
Speaker 0: Yeah except the thing is valve doesn't seem to remember or realize that Counter-Strike was pretty much the only reason people actually use steam.

116
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:30,219
Speaker 0: back in the day when steam was announced and came out it was almost universally reviled as being stupid and most people myself included only Downloaded it in order to make our ability to play Counter-Strike easier and better.

117
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:39,420
Speaker 0: Yeah and to me The only reason Counter-Strike even exists for them from a business perspective is to trick people into getting steam and then paying for other games.

118
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:41,249
Speaker 0: Of course, I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

119
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,160
Speaker 0: counter-strikes been on the decline for many years.

120
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:46,130
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't like counter-strike source.

121
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,331
Speaker 0: Hence.

122
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:47,515
Speaker 0: They keep playing counter-strike 1.6.

123
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:52,311
Speaker 0: Yep, and To me that was just the final nail in the coffin.

124
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:55,926
Speaker 0: if they actually put ads and counter-strike source I'll probably just never bother playing it again.

125
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,451
Speaker 0: Yeah to be perfectly honest.

126
00:07:57,993 --> 00:08:00,080
Speaker 1: I really I know I haven't played counter-strike in years.

127
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,720
Speaker 1: I don't really have a need to play it.

128
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,920
Speaker 1: I mean if they didn't put ads in it, I might have pulled it out now and again.

129
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:09,100
Speaker 1: I probably never in my life ads or not become heavy into counter-strike again.

130
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:11,080
Speaker 0: Well, no because there are games like natural selection.

131
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I every now and then have the urge to play counter-strike and I had a lot of good memories playing counter-strike.

132
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:23,751
Speaker 0: But if I have to sit there dealing with coke ads while I'm playing counter-strike a game that I barely want to play to Begin with there's just no way no way.

133
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:27,710
Speaker 1: But yeah, you're right about the whole DRM thing is like why should?

134
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,474
Speaker 1: it's a video game that I bought, you know If this patches I should be able to choose if I want those patches or not.

135
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,900
Speaker 1: You shouldn't be able to deny me.

136
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:39,320
Speaker 1: I mean technically they're giving you a license to play the game and they agree.

137
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,014
Speaker 1: But you know, there's the license agreement which means they can revoke it whatever whatever.

138
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,420
Speaker 1: but is it right?

139
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:48,437
Speaker 1: I mean, what if Nintendo gave everyone Super Mario Brothers back in 82, right?

140
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:56,549
Speaker 1: And then that Super Mario Brothers that we originally got for the NES Depended on some servers at Nintendo in order to play.

141
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,821
Speaker 1: and in 1985 they changed level 2 - 1.

142
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:07,960
Speaker 1: They just changed the level and now it was impossible for anyone anywhere to play level 2 - 1 in the old way ever again.

143
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:10,532
Speaker 1: And then let's say a few years later.

144
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:12,059
Speaker 1: They just turn Mario 1 off.

145
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,920
Speaker 1: now No one in the whole world can play Mario 1 ever again.

146
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:20,699
Speaker 1: That's the kind of control that valve has now has over games like counter-strike see a steam.

147
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:24,740
Speaker 1: It's really kind of control that people like Blizzard have of a World of Warcraft.

148
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:29,059
Speaker 0: It's really a loss because a lot of our listeners and us really want to play tribes, too.

149
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:33,074
Speaker 0: We all own it or can get it for free because they actually gave it away for free.

150
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:46,420
Speaker 0: There's no reason Absolutely, no technical reason in the world that we couldn't run a tribes to server and play a game right now Except that they no longer give out CD keys and they're not maintaining anything.

151
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:55,400
Speaker 0: But even though they're not maintaining anything the game requires their servers to function even though those servers provide No gameplay mechanic whatsoever.

152
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:07,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there are hacks and wares and all sorts of things that we can do but you know technically illegal and Annoying and difficult and not really I don't really want to deal with it.

153
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,751
Speaker 1: I'd rather you know, I don't want to deal with ads.

154
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:16,300
Speaker 0: I'm definitely not gonna deal with that hassle Yeah, especially not to mention dangerous since most hacks these days include some sort of malware.

155
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:18,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're talking about windows here too.

156
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:19,820
Speaker 1: These things don't run on Linux.

157
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:34,263
Speaker 1: So well, I mean the tribes twos and counter-strike servers run on Linux, but the games not so much anyway, so my news is It's kind of weird because every video game site had this news all over the place today and I was like What's the big deal?

158
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:34,785
Speaker 1: Who cares?

159
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:41,290
Speaker 1: And then I was like, oh once I finally, you know sort of Consciously understood what they were saying.

160
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:46,740
Speaker 1: The news is pretty simple Dragon Quest 9 is gonna be on the DS.

161
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:48,044
Speaker 0: What do you do?

162
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:53,142
Speaker 1: Yep, if you don't know what Dragon Quest is, it's Dragon Warrior which is.

163
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:58,908
Speaker 1: you know the game with the slimes and the Drake ease and the The big stone golems.

164
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:01,238
Speaker 0: I believe the word is Drake Drake II.

165
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:03,352
Speaker 0: You know English works, right?

166
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:07,468
Speaker 1: Yeah How is it spelled in the in the game?

167
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:08,631
Speaker 0: dr a ke.

168
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:15,168
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it had either two E's or a Y. No, or possibly just dr a K.

169
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:17,434
Speaker 0: It was dr a ke whatever.

170
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:18,578
Speaker 1: It's a tricky.

171
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:24,475
Speaker 1: anyway If you don't know about Dragon Warrior, or maybe you've only experienced it in the u.s.

172
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,247
Speaker 1: It is Stupid huge in Japan.

173
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:33,129
Speaker 1: We're talking stupid huge on a level You can't possibly comprehend.

174
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,758
Speaker 1: as big as Halo were.

175
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,726
Speaker 1: Freaking Grand Theft Auto is here.

176
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,051
Speaker 0: That's bigger than Jesus.

177
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:44,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how a big Dragon Quest is in Japan.

178
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:55,220
Speaker 1: There are laws that they made in Japan that you can't release this kind of game on certain days of the week Because people won't go to work and they'll go wait in line to get the game and play it all day.

179
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,119
Speaker 1: You know, this is the kind of shit that like halts the Japanese economy when Dragon Quest comes out now.

180
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:04,774
Speaker 1: Dragon Quest has always been on the most popular system.

181
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,480
Speaker 1: It was on the NES slash Famicom.

182
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:08,085
Speaker 1: It was.

183
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,939
Speaker 1: think that was there an SNES one.

184
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:15,621
Speaker 1: I don't remember, you know There was a PlayStation 1 and then it was on the PlayStation 2.

185
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:21,359
Speaker 1: The fact that it's moving to the DS is basically saying the DS is now the number one system in Japan.

186
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:24,272
Speaker 0: PS2 is dead, which is pretty much true.

187
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:33,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of crazy though It's like imagine if Grand Theft Auto and everything started coming out for the Wii and Wasn't on the ps3 or the Xbox 360.

188
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:34,591
Speaker 1: That's what this is.

189
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:35,374
Speaker 1: Like that.

190
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:36,960
Speaker 1: That is how big this news is now.

191
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:50,659
Speaker 1: They didn't actually say it's not coming out for the ps2 But the fact that they just said yes coming out for the DS and they didn't say anything else It's it's basically 90% sure that it's not coming out for anything else.

192
00:12:51,425 --> 00:13:00,700
Speaker 1: The other thing that's interesting about this news Is that traditionally like Dragon Quest sub games have come out for the Gameboy like Dragon Quest monsters and dragon?

193
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:02,759
Speaker 1: rocket slime.

194
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,499
Speaker 1: Those are good games.

195
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:12,153
Speaker 1: But here is like the net the sequel in the main series of games coming out for the DS.

196
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:18,215
Speaker 1: that would be like if Final Fantasy 13 came out for the DS and didn't come out for anything else.

197
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:19,580
Speaker 1: It's insane.

198
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:25,749
Speaker 0: Well, it's like I've said many times for me until the week came out The DS was my primary gaming console.

199
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:33,400
Speaker 0: as in I played games on my DS in Situations where I'd normally play whatever game I opened at the time or whatever console I owned.

200
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:38,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing is this game is gonna have some four player online co-op action.

201
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:44,660
Speaker 1: So really this might actually be a game that we're gonna want to buy when they bring it over to this side of the ocean.

202
00:13:45,182 --> 00:13:50,587
Speaker 1: If they do which I'm sure they will they'd better because the game is just so huge and I love The other thing.

203
00:13:50,607 --> 00:14:05,016
Speaker 1: the last thing I want to say is in this article They had this little light image and it shows a bunch of slimes holding up a Japanese flag and then one slime holding up an American flag to show the difference in popularity of the game and the two countries.

204
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:09,917
Speaker 0: Now does that represent any sort of number or is it just a graphic someone made?

205
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:10,580
Speaker 1: It's just a graphic.

206
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,050
Speaker 1: It's really cute with a bunch of slimes.

207
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:12,734
Speaker 0: Oh God.

208
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:23,939
Speaker 0: Yeah things of the day Man, I said it the way I used to say it.

209
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:26,267
Speaker 0: Okay, people seem to like that.

210
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,919
Speaker 1: I guess then whatever I don't really care.

211
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:33,369
Speaker 0: So go first or should I you know what I'll go first?

212
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,272
Speaker 0: mines real quick.

213
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:35,997
Speaker 1: Mine's also real quick.

214
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:41,051
Speaker 0: Oh, no, so USB has spawned a lot of very useful things.

215
00:14:41,091 --> 00:14:43,200
Speaker 0: There's also spawned a lot of very silly things.

216
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:51,040
Speaker 1: Well, it's useful in that it's it's a plug that almost every device now has and it provides power as well as data.

217
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,735
Speaker 1: So if you want to plug something into USB, you can just get electricity out of it.

218
00:14:55,756 --> 00:15:00,093
Speaker 0: So there are even devices like Flashlights that plug into USB.

219
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:09,322
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm They're USB cell phone chargers, you know that they just charge your cell phone by taking electricity from the computer into the Cellphone there.

220
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:18,172
Speaker 0: Well, it just so happens that someone has made perhaps the most perfect Combination of stupid thing and useful thing ever.

221
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:20,560
Speaker 0: in the face of the Internet mankind and computing.

222
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,266
Speaker 1: It can't be the best.

223
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:26,460
Speaker 0: Well, you see what they did is they took a USB memory stick.

224
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,545
Speaker 0: You know one that holds memory.

225
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:34,840
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and they took a humping dog Like a real dog like a little plastic dog.

226
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:40,627
Speaker 0: Okay, where his member would be is a USB port USB connector sticking out.

227
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:48,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you plug it into a USB device It will begin humping the data into the computer.

228
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:52,659
Speaker 0: That's just hilarious, I don't know what else I can say about that.

229
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:55,010
Speaker 1: I think that might be the best USB stick ever.

230
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,140
Speaker 1: definitely beats out the USB sushi sticks.

231
00:15:57,562 --> 00:16:04,031
Speaker 0: all I have to say is some of the things that showed up as Related videos probably don't want to watch no.

232
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:09,390
Speaker 1: Oh god, then they're not donkey shows, but God Yeah, mine mine is a donkey show.

233
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,253
Speaker 1: speaking of donkeys.

234
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:15,987
Speaker 1: Oh My Thing of the day is pretty simple.

235
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:18,239
Speaker 1: It's Mega Man versus Donkey Kong.

236
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:28,222
Speaker 1: now You might have seen that video Halo versus Donkey Kong where the halo guys come in and they shoot you know with their guns and they take over Donkey Kong Pretty easily.

237
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:31,231
Speaker 1: Well, this one has Mega Man fighting Donkey Kong.

238
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:35,991
Speaker 1: and you know, if I compare this video with the halo one I think the Mega Man could kick the halo.

239
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:40,540
Speaker 0: guys asses easily How much damage Mega Man has taken in the course of his career.

240
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:45,115
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's true and he is a robot so it doesn't actually do anything permanent.

241
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:46,822
Speaker 1: as long as he makes it out alive Dr.

242
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:47,666
Speaker 1: Light fixes him up.

243
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:50,220
Speaker 0: So I mean he's got all those powers.

244
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:53,640
Speaker 0: He can throw stuff like guts man and he can throw stuff like dust man.

245
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,282
Speaker 1: That's right.

246
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,428
Speaker 1: Depends how many guys he's already beaten.

247
00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:01,239
Speaker 0: Well, you know cannon wise he's beaten a whole bunch of guys.

248
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:03,327
Speaker 0: for some reason He just loses the powers all the time.

249
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:04,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what's up with that.

250
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:11,279
Speaker 1: by the time you're playing Mega Man 7 You think you should have like, you know, six times eight forty eight different weapons to choose from.

251
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:22,040
Speaker 0: see I think it's like Legend of Zelda where the timeline keeps branching and They're actually all those Mega Man's happen at the exact same time.

252
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,336
Speaker 1: No, actually they kind of they have this story that actually connects them all and that that's the cannon.

253
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:28,580
Speaker 1: It's kind of scary.

254
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:30,209
Speaker 0: So then why does he lose his cannon?

255
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:31,234
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

256
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:32,260
Speaker 1: This doesn't make sense.

257
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,240
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go read online and so I'm sure there's an explanation for it that someone came up with.

258
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,822
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

259
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:37,144
Speaker 0: Dr.

260
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:40,620
Speaker 1: Light and common in could be he is a crazy old man.

261
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:43,432
Speaker 1: Now the funny thing that if dr.

262
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:46,609
Speaker 1: Light, you know knew so much He wouldn't need to make Mega Man to solve the problem.

263
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,493
Speaker 1: He could just do it himself.

264
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:48,860
Speaker 0: All right, here's what I don't get.

265
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:49,502
Speaker 0: Dr.

266
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:54,400
Speaker 0: Wily keeps breaking out of whatever hellhole they lock him in making giant robot masters to come and destroy the world.

267
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,709
Speaker 0: Why don't they the next time they catch?

268
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:57,010
Speaker 0: Dr.

269
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,857
Speaker 0: Wily just shoot him.

270
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:05,150
Speaker 1: they did But then it was really like a robot or it was a clone or it was a. you know They didn't actually catch him because dr.

271
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:05,994
Speaker 1: Wily is too smart.

272
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:06,717
Speaker 1: He's all wily.

273
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:07,360
Speaker 1: He gets away.

274
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:10,455
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they caught him at least one at least in this instance.

275
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:10,736
Speaker 1: Dr.

276
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:11,600
Speaker 1: Wily is pretty stupid.

277
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,609
Speaker 1: He chose Donkey Kong to be a robot master.

278
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:14,452
Speaker 1: considering Donkey.

279
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:15,979
Speaker 1: No, I think neither a robot nor a man.

280
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,645
Speaker 1: I think doggy cows a bad.

281
00:18:17,665 --> 00:18:23,432
Speaker 0: primary problem was that being not a robot it took one Mega Man pellet To take him out.

282
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:34,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much Thing is I predicted accurately the end of this video and if you don't also predict accurately the ending of this video before it comes Up, I think you might have some mental difficulties there.

283
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:39,579
Speaker 1: If that is the case, I sentence you to play Mega Man 2 until you beat it two times.

284
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:46,400
Speaker 0: You know, I never beat Mega Man 2. you suck or four or five or six or seven or any of the exes or one.

285
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:47,345
Speaker 1: It should be five.

286
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:48,531
Speaker 1: five is the proto man one.

287
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:50,260
Speaker 0: See the other thing is I never even tried.

288
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:51,776
Speaker 0: I never liked Mega Man games.

289
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:52,140
Speaker 1: you suck.

290
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:52,883
Speaker 0: I own mega.

291
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:56,179
Speaker 0: I try guide Mega Man 3 because I traded some kid hide lied for it.

292
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,826
Speaker 1: Three's the second best one.

293
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:00,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I usually just cheated and ran around exploring glitches.

294
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:04,257
Speaker 0: I never actually tried to beat the game and that game was glitchy as all hell.

295
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:04,780
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

296
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, the glitches were great.

297
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,514
Speaker 0: I had more fun with the glitches than ever did.

298
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:08,439
Speaker 0: I never even got to dr.

299
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,504
Speaker 0: Wily, I don't think.

300
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:17,600
Speaker 1: one time I was playing Mega Man 2 and I was fighting bubble man and The gate opened up and I actually went backwards into the waiting room again.

301
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:23,601
Speaker 1: Then I went back into the bubble man room and it was all fucked up and I had to reset my NES man when I was A kid.

302
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,666
Speaker 0: I loved it when that happened.

303
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:26,735
Speaker 0: now, I hate it when that happens.

304
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:34,310
Speaker 0: Yeah Yep, the winds of change are Changing so we doing the show on.

305
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:36,560
Speaker 0: I think we're gonna do the show on the virtual console.

306
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:48,111
Speaker 0: Oh, alrighty see more specifically probably the greatest sports game ever to be made for any video game system ever Worth about a million space dollars is ice hockey.

307
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:48,793
Speaker 1: Yep.

308
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:51,360
Speaker 1: The game is called ice hockey.

309
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:53,466
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's like in television.

310
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:55,312
Speaker 1: what's the name of the football game on television?

311
00:19:55,573 --> 00:20:00,508
Speaker 1: It's not called Madden something something It's not called 10 yard fight.

312
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:04,500
Speaker 1: It's not called Tecmo Super Bowl, even though Tecmo Super Bowl is the best football game.

313
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,342
Speaker 0: It's called football Football.

314
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:13,198
Speaker 1: and what's the ice hockey game on the NES called besides blades of steel, which is almost as good.

315
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:13,900
Speaker 1: It's almost as good.

316
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:15,617
Speaker 1: It's called ice hockey.

317
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:24,377
Speaker 0: now You see the reason we want to talk about ice hockey is partly because we want to talk about the virtual console Which is both one of the best things and the worst things of the Nintendo Wii.

318
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,359
Speaker 0: Mmm You see the the concept is great.

319
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:33,840
Speaker 0: Nintendo has a very large library of old intellectual property.

320
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,114
Speaker 0: That is not making them very much money at all.

321
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:41,554
Speaker 1: If any yeah I used to complain like it's not right for them to make ROMs illegal.

322
00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:43,340
Speaker 1: These things are no longer available.

323
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:46,560
Speaker 1: No one is making money off of this intellectual property.

324
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:52,300
Speaker 1: Therefore it is not morally wrong to just take it and copy it and keep it alive and in the world.

325
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:56,725
Speaker 1: But now that argument doesn't work anymore Which is good and bad.

326
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:16,340
Speaker 0: Nintendo is very smart and they realize from you know years of outcry that their fans Really like their old games and as they learn from releasing compilations of old You know Super Nintendo and such games for the GameCube people will buy Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 and ice climbers again and again and again because they love these games.

327
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,820
Speaker 0: People want to play old Nintendo games a lot.

328
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:26,035
Speaker 0: They sure do so in the Wii in addition to having you know All the games you can buy for it and the games you can buy for the GameCube.

329
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:26,980
Speaker 0: that works just fine on it.

330
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:34,080
Speaker 0: You can also buy virtual console games which range from NES to SNES to TurboGrafx-16 to Sega Genesis.

331
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:36,988
Speaker 0: They're based basically an emulator.

332
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:48,520
Speaker 0: you can just buy these games from Nintendo straight up legitimately a hundred percent accurate and play them in your Wii with Absolutely zero effort difficulty or problem whatsoever.

333
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,226
Speaker 1: That is what they do.

334
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:54,300
Speaker 1: have one significant advantage over emulators and that it always works easily.

335
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:57,293
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, most people don't have any problem.

336
00:21:57,895 --> 00:21:59,040
Speaker 1: if you know how to use an emulator.

337
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:09,120
Speaker 1: You don't have really a problem with NES and SNES Emulation because it's so well done that these days the NES and SNES emulators are so good that everything works great.

338
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:13,032
Speaker 1: But Genesis emulators even today, they're a little bit flaky.

339
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:15,822
Speaker 1: You know, you can't always get them to go full screen to work Right.

340
00:22:16,163 --> 00:22:19,940
Speaker 1: There's no way you're gonna get Sega CD and 32x stuff to be a turbo graphics.

341
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:20,502
Speaker 0: I've never.

342
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:26,340
Speaker 1: even I'm pretty sure there are turbo graphics emulators, but don't ask me what to name one or how they work.

343
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:31,299
Speaker 1: It's you know, and I don't imagine that they work as well as ZSNES or SNES 9x.

344
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:35,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz watch there's like a half of a person working on that project.

345
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:42,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you've got MAME which works really well, but you know, no no MAME works really well when it works.

346
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:50,100
Speaker 1: Well, the problem with MAME is that since every arcade game is different that the controls are often confusing You need to reconfigure them for each game a little bit.

347
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,980
Speaker 0: Also many ROMs for various reasons are dumped incorrectly or formatted wrong and just don't work.

348
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,516
Speaker 1: Well, that's you have to go to the right places to download, you know The big ROM packs that have every MAME ROM ever.

349
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:07,920
Speaker 1: and yeah It's just too many MAME games and most of the games are not worth playing and also total speculation.

350
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:11,466
Speaker 0: Probably not true yet, but I could see this happening in the future.

351
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:13,410
Speaker 0: This is something that I really am hoping for.

352
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:18,430
Speaker 0: DS can connect to the Wii and theoretically there are a lot of ways they could use that.

353
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,650
Speaker 0: Say in addition to having Sega Genesis and all these games.

354
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:30,840
Speaker 0: They also have Sega Game Gear games And say you could download them temporarily to your DS to play them on the go.

355
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,824
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no reason.

356
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:35,880
Speaker 1: they couldn't turn the the Wii into like a DS download machine.

357
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:44,010
Speaker 1: So you could just turn on your Wii choose a virtual console game turn on your DS and click download play And then the virtual console game would go to your DS.

358
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:46,680
Speaker 1: There's no reason that isn't technologically feasible.

359
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,727
Speaker 0: I am certain that that is going to happen.

360
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:56,795
Speaker 0: I am absolutely certain that at some point maybe not right now maybe not for a year, but I Nintendo is definitely looking into that.

361
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,520
Speaker 0: That is my opinion.

362
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:09,172
Speaker 1: I'm not certain just because over in the history there have always been many things which are as equally important and intelligent to do that haven't been done that There's gonna be something just like that.

363
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:10,178
Speaker 1: That's not gonna happen.

364
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:13,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, not everything that could happen is gonna happen because it's never been true.

365
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:17,856
Speaker 0: That's why I'm putting up a thousand space dollars instead of a thousand real dollars.

366
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:23,680
Speaker 1: I like space dollars Yeah, so anyway what's wrong with the virtual console, all right.

367
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:36,120
Speaker 0: Well, see I only have one Complaint at all about the virtual console and while it is a complaint for me and for people like me and people like Scott It really isn't a complaint for many other people who may not have the technological know-how here.

368
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:42,620
Speaker 0: But not I'm not saying that you know They have to compete with the free ROMs because that's really kind of a different world there.

369
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,744
Speaker 0: Well, and I'm not gonna.

370
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:48,660
Speaker 0: I wouldn't complain if the games cost more than free because they have to cost more than free.

371
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:56,439
Speaker 0: The problem is they cost so much more than free that I couldn't imagine Paying that much money for one of these games.

372
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:08,790
Speaker 1: Well, you see here's the thing is I'm willing to pay money for video games and music and all this other stuff that you can get for free Because I'm not actually buying the game.

373
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:15,019
Speaker 1: at least the way I see it is if I buy music from say iTunes Right, which I'm not willing to do because this DRM and shit.

374
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:19,515
Speaker 1: But let's say iTunes sold plain old mp3s at 10 cents each.

375
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:28,576
Speaker 1: I would totally be willing to pay for that because It's easy and the easiness of doing it and making sure I'm getting the right song.

376
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:37,205
Speaker 1: and you know The selection of songs always being available downloading quickly always working not having problems Etc, etc.

377
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:38,671
Speaker 1: is worth 10 cents.

378
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:40,940
Speaker 1: I'm not paying for the music because I get that for free.

379
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:48,729
Speaker 1: I'm paying for getting the music conveniently as opposed to having do a pain in the ass Going on bittorrent getting songs.

380
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:51,338
Speaker 1: I don't want waiting too long, etc, etc, etc.

381
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,380
Speaker 0: Now that's why I think Nintendo really knows what it's doing with a virtual console one.

382
00:25:56,022 --> 00:26:00,576
Speaker 0: Instead of using money you use points that are equivalent of what one cent per point.

383
00:26:00,717 --> 00:26:01,820
Speaker 1: It's one cent per point.

384
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:03,399
Speaker 1: It's also one yen per point.

385
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:11,974
Speaker 0: So if you buy a bunch of these points and you're in the virtual console It'll list the games that are currently available to buy and if you buy one it costs, you know, 400 500 600 800 points.

386
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,548
Speaker 0: So it doesn't feel like real money.

387
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:22,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, they also do that because you know, for example I had I had 2,000 points because I bought the.

388
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,877
Speaker 1: you know The 2,000 point card when I've got the Wii and I've spent 1900 points.

389
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:30,099
Speaker 1: now I've got a hundred points, but you can't buy shit.

390
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:41,240
Speaker 0: So I either lose a dollar forever or I'm eventually gonna buy another game and give them more money Except that that doesn't work forever because you can buy a specific number of points with your credit card.

391
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:48,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I wanted to I could but you know by the exact number of points by one more game and then have zero.

392
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,680
Speaker 1: It never buy another game again, but you know, they that's the reason they use points like that.

393
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:58,179
Speaker 0: So one though Nintendo gets your money up front meaning they're making profits ahead of having a deliverable.

394
00:26:58,761 --> 00:26:59,645
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm to.

395
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:03,440
Speaker 0: the deliverables cost them practically nothing.

396
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:13,296
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure they're paying money to run the servers that have these games on them but compared to the money They make from all the games coming out and they're basically breaking in.

397
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:14,160
Speaker 0: well think about it.

398
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:22,709
Speaker 0: even if a million people buy a I don't know 24 kilobyte game a Million times 24 kilobytes not so much bandwidth.

399
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,180
Speaker 1: No, not so much a big computer to handle all those requests.

400
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:29,117
Speaker 0: But yeah, yeah, they're probably not gonna all come at once.

401
00:27:29,137 --> 00:27:34,618
Speaker 1: No Well, it seems like you know, they've been releasing the virtual console games Monday nights on Monday morning.

402
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,060
Speaker 1: actually.

403
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:57,380
Speaker 0: Well, see that's that's the other thing The reason Nintendo is smart about this not saying it's good for me but they're releasing the games in tiny waves where it seems like people who want to use their virtual points that they've got and Just itching to spend them will buy the best of each available wave Either because they wanted to buy something or because they look through and the games they see.

404
00:27:58,022 --> 00:28:04,834
Speaker 0: I mean if every game were available all the old crap games that no one ever cared about would never get bogged because no One would think to look for them except old codgers like us.

405
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:08,438
Speaker 0: now They'll see ice hockey and go ice hockey, huh?

406
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,237
Speaker 0: Cuz only three games came out that week and they're more likely to buy it just waiting for other games.

407
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:18,868
Speaker 1: Yep But anyway, yeah The virtual console games are way too high priced.

408
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:26,996
Speaker 1: if you realize that a hundred points is a dollar you can see that they're selling Sonic the Hedgehog one for like $8 something like that.

409
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:27,940
Speaker 1: It's pretty stupid.

410
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:29,925
Speaker 0: Sim City is eight bucks.

411
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:32,815
Speaker 1: Yeah Sim City for the SNES eight bucks.

412
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:40,520
Speaker 0: now, I will say right now I doubt it does but if it's somehow Integrated the remote into that so I could use it like a mouse I pay bucks for that in a second.

413
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:41,611
Speaker 1: But I'm sure it does.

414
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:46,697
Speaker 1: I'm almost I'm 99.9 repeating percent, you know bothers me the most about that.

415
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:47,340
Speaker 1: Isn't that?

416
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,646
Speaker 1: Okay, they're charging eight bucks.

417
00:28:48,706 --> 00:28:50,999
Speaker 1: or Sonic the Hedgehog or whatever they're charging for it.

418
00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:56,886
Speaker 1: You can buy Sonic mega collection for the GameCube Which is exactly the same goddamn thing.

419
00:28:57,067 --> 00:29:03,806
Speaker 1: only it also comes with Sonic 2 Sonic 3 Sonic and Knuckles Sonic 3d blast and dr Robotnik's mean bean machine.

420
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,940
Speaker 1: but but it's like 10 bucks at the game store.

421
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:09,748
Speaker 0: You can't just play that on a whim.

422
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:13,460
Speaker 0: You have to put the GameCube disc in and play gasp.

423
00:29:14,022 --> 00:29:14,926
Speaker 0: Yeah convenience.

424
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:16,572
Speaker 1: Oh my god, you're paying for that.

425
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:18,400
Speaker 1: the the meager is convenience.

426
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:35,553
Speaker 1: Let's see if you were to buy all those games on the better on Sonic mega collection Which is 10 bucks GameCube game if you were to buy all the Sonic games that are in that Separately on the virtual console two of which are now available You can get robot next to me and bean machine and you can get Sonic 1.

427
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:42,748
Speaker 1: Let's see that would cost you at least 30 50 bucks Insane insane amount of money.

428
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,380
Speaker 1: or you can spend 10 bucks and get Sonic mega collection.

429
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:50,260
Speaker 0: See now there's also where Nintendo is gonna make a bunch of money because a lot of people don't realize that.

430
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:56,520
Speaker 0: In fact, a lot of people probably don't even realize that you can just emulate ROMs or get them on the internet for free.

431
00:29:57,135 --> 00:30:04,113
Speaker 1: Yeah Or even if they definitely gonna make a lot of money off the people who don't know better that you know They don't even realize that those games can be had for free.

432
00:30:04,153 --> 00:30:05,157
Speaker 1: They don't even emulator.

433
00:30:05,198 --> 00:30:05,640
Speaker 1: What's that?

434
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,833
Speaker 1: Those people are gonna spend a lot of money on a virtual console.

435
00:30:09,094 --> 00:30:10,340
Speaker 1: It looks like a good deal to them.

436
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:18,420
Speaker 0: So what I think is gonna happen is Nintendo is gonna just have these games up and they'll keep doing their thing Until they stop making crazy amounts of money.

437
00:30:18,882 --> 00:30:32,895
Speaker 0: So they'll sell every game, you know five bucks eight bucks twelve bucks and then later They'll take all the games in different genres or different types or different waves or whatever bundle them up in little packages and sell the whole package for like a thousand points like super discounted.

438
00:30:33,016 --> 00:30:36,199
Speaker 1: they should but who knows if They will that might be a long time off.

439
00:30:36,508 --> 00:30:41,075
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I probably will be but if they're smart they'll have this trailing edge where the price just keeps dropped.

440
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:49,766
Speaker 0: like the price will sit at Until everyone within reason who's gonna buy it at that price point buys it as soon as sales dry up It'll drop to the next price point.

441
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:52,780
Speaker 0: So everyone pays exactly what they're willing to pay for that game.

442
00:30:52,901 --> 00:31:02,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean even if you're really think about it They make a hundred percent profit effectively on any of these games that they sell unless it's a game They have to re get a license to or something.

443
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be hard for the notice.

444
00:31:05,913 --> 00:31:07,140
Speaker 1: other aren't a Capcom games.

445
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,730
Speaker 1: I haven't seen any Mega Man's or Street Fighter's or anything.

446
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:15,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus I already bought the Mega Man and Mega Man X collection, so that's they're not gonna get those off of me.

447
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:24,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, no way granted though if despite these high prices and despite all our complaining We've bought well Scott has bought several virtual console game.

448
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,079
Speaker 1: I bought three because they're the only three that are worth it.

449
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,029
Speaker 0: So I guess we're gonna talk about those three.

450
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:31,380
Speaker 0: All right, that's kind of a dual episode here.

451
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,500
Speaker 1: Well, the first one that I bought was Superstar Soldier, which is a turbo graphic 16 shmup game.

452
00:31:36,842 --> 00:31:39,239
Speaker 0: We bought it primarily because it was a turbo graphics game.

453
00:31:39,742 --> 00:31:44,660
Speaker 1: There was no way that I was ever gonna be able to play that game if I didn't buy it on the virtual console.

454
00:31:44,962 --> 00:31:48,242
Speaker 0: It's an okay shmup and that's coming from a guy who hates shmups and it's got.

455
00:31:48,262 --> 00:31:56,873
Speaker 1: the thing about this shmup that makes it really unique is the music which is really awesome like if It's definitely on Gradius 3 level of music here.

456
00:31:56,993 --> 00:31:58,400
Speaker 0: That was one thing about the turbo graphics.

457
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,380
Speaker 0: A lot of the games had really good music really good.

458
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:03,440
Speaker 1: And the other thing about it is it has the normal shmup mode.

459
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:10,440
Speaker 1: you know where you fly around and you try to beat all the bosses and get to the last level and It starts off easy and then it gets really hard.

460
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,586
Speaker 1: So even if you're not a shmup master, you know, it deceives you and it pulls you in and then it says, aha I'm not actually a simple shmup.

461
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:20,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I beat the first level without dying for me.

462
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,320
Speaker 0: That's crazy.

463
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:31,677
Speaker 0: I mean I die in the first level of Gradius 3 and then in level 2 Level 2 I made it about halfway through and then things started getting tough And then I got to that boss and he immediately killed me until all my lives were gone.

464
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:33,987
Speaker 1: Yeah The other thing that's interesting.

465
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:36,740
Speaker 1: it has another mode the other mode or the timed modes.

466
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:49,985
Speaker 1: There's like the three-minute mode and the five-minute mode and all it does is it says Okay play in this special level the cargo level for three minutes or five minutes depending on which mode you pick and See how high a score you can get.

467
00:32:50,346 --> 00:32:58,500
Speaker 1: and it's actually really fun because the cargo level is very different from the normal levels And the types of bad guys you see there and all the different things that you can shoot.

468
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,939
Speaker 0: There's a lot of stuff to blow up.

469
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,959
Speaker 1: Yeah There's a lot of stuff to blow up and you can't really choose all the weapons.

470
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:11,940
Speaker 1: But and you only have five minutes and you got to try to beat it without You know just go as far as you can and I've only ever gotten so far in it.

471
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,919
Speaker 1: So I really wonder hey, how far does it go?

472
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,360
Speaker 1: Could I get like twice as far as I got now because I end up dying it like a certain point?

473
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:24,880
Speaker 1: So it's it's really intriguing that mode to see what's the farthest you can possibly get in five minutes.

474
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:25,966
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good game though.

475
00:33:25,987 --> 00:33:28,040
Speaker 0: If you like shmups at all, you'll probably want to pick it up.

476
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,064
Speaker 0: It's not that much money.

477
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:32,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, the next game I got is Gunstar Heroes, which is a game by treasure.

478
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,960
Speaker 1: now If you don't know treasure is a game developer.

479
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:47,730
Speaker 1: I don't know if they still exist but they made a lot of awesome games mostly Sega Genesis games that are really really awesome like dynamite heady and Gunstar Heroes and I can't name any others, but they're all awesome.

480
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:53,128
Speaker 0: Well dynamite heady is pretty cool and Gunstar Heroes Well, I haven't actually played it yet looked pretty cool.

481
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:54,933
Speaker 1: Yeah the way Gunstar Heroes works.

482
00:33:54,993 --> 00:34:01,578
Speaker 1: It's sort of like Turrican or Contra or Strider, you know, you're a guy who walks around shooting stuff.

483
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:04,840
Speaker 1: Yep Metal slug metal slug is a good example.

484
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,833
Speaker 0: Just run to the right shooting a whole bunch of projectiles and a whole bunch of bad guys.

485
00:34:09,054 --> 00:34:15,933
Speaker 1: now the interesting thing about Gunstar Heroes is that you have a whole lot of moves that you can do.

486
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:19,666
Speaker 1: you can jump you can slide You can like kick guys.

487
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:23,279
Speaker 1: you can grab bad guys and throw them at other bad guys.

488
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:24,223
Speaker 1: You can.

489
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:29,380
Speaker 1: you know all kinds of crazy shit, but the way the weapons work is the most interesting.

490
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,127
Speaker 1: There are four weapons.

491
00:34:31,187 --> 00:34:32,070
Speaker 1: the homing weapon.

492
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:36,911
Speaker 1: five is right out exactly therefore, that's the rapid-fire weapon.

493
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:44,306
Speaker 1: fire the laser and the homing and You can get any two of these.

494
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:48,139
Speaker 1: you pick which one you want to start with and you get that always.

495
00:34:48,744 --> 00:34:50,393
Speaker 1: But you can choose other ones.

496
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:51,260
Speaker 1: you find them in the level.

497
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,819
Speaker 1: You can also give up weapons to switch them out for other ones.

498
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:56,380
Speaker 1: now Let's say I get two homing weapons, right?

499
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:04,729
Speaker 1: I can choose to either use the homing weapon the other homing weapon or the double homing weapon, which is awkward.

500
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:13,743
Speaker 1: yeah What does that have to do with double homing double Hawk Good one.

501
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:14,867
Speaker 0: See I didn't play this game.

502
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:17,980
Speaker 0: So all I can do is provide inane commentary and color.

503
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:19,124
Speaker 1: Now here's the trick.

504
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:23,457
Speaker 1: you ready, let's say I get the rapid-fire weapon and the laser right.

505
00:35:23,798 --> 00:35:37,340
Speaker 1: well now I can fire the rapid-fire weapon the laser or the rapid laser And that's why Gunstar Heroes is awesome because there's all these different combinations of weapons that are useful in different situations.

506
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:44,425
Speaker 1: I highly recommend getting the homing laser or the Rapid-fire fire.

507
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:51,830
Speaker 0: those are quite interesting now, of course last and least well by least I mean most awesome or least not awesome.

508
00:35:52,030 --> 00:36:04,224
Speaker 0: Yeah would be ice hockey which we bought 100% because it is worth a significant amount of money to have that game in the holster ready to go any time 24/7.

509
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,880
Speaker 1: also because I wanted to vote for it like, you know say yes, we care about ice hockey.

510
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:09,101
Speaker 1: See

511
00:36:09,142 --> 00:36:21,506
Speaker 0: it's kind of like how anime world order always says, you know Buy the old crappy robot anime that you like Even if the DVD release isn't that good or whatever or the show was actually kind of bad just to tell the world that yes There is a market.

512
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:22,391
Speaker 0: bring us more.

513
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:22,994
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

514
00:36:23,939 --> 00:36:27,993
Speaker 1: and Also because I want to play it using Controllers that aren't shit.

515
00:36:28,557 --> 00:36:36,723
Speaker 1: Yeah That's a big problem with emulating is that you have a PC or something plugged into your TV and you got to use some shitty USB gamepad.

516
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:38,167
Speaker 0: now they all suck.

517
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:45,773
Speaker 1: you could get an Xbox 360 gamepad theoretically to work But not easy not the most trivial of things.

518
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:47,680
Speaker 0: also really expensive for what you get.

519
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a $40 for an Xbox 360 wired controller.

520
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:56,566
Speaker 1: screw that shit Yeah, and get a third-party Xbox 360 controller, but that's even worse.

521
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:57,547
Speaker 1: That's like good God.

522
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:05,020
Speaker 0: and then you know, there's all the Various gravis type gamepad things and for various reasons they all just suck.

523
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:13,836
Speaker 0: We'd go into great details to why they all suck But I've never ever Seen one that could sufficiently emulate an actual Nintendo or Super Nintendo controller.

524
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:15,280
Speaker 0: enough for me to not be continually.

525
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:21,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually the buttons are okay or at least sufficient but the the arrow part is not good at all.

526
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:32,900
Speaker 0: Yeah it's always either some disk or some inaccurate piece of shit or maybe it's like a Busted kind of joystick deal or you always end up hitting diagonals when he didn't want to because they made it wrong.

527
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:39,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean a lot of people use that Logitech thing with the dual analogs or they use the Microsoft Sidewinder on the PC.

528
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:41,089
Speaker 1: But I hate those things that they're not.

529
00:37:41,149 --> 00:37:42,436
Speaker 1: they totally like kill my hands.

530
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:43,401
Speaker 1: I can't use that shit Now.

531
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:52,732
Speaker 0: the only option really for until recently was to really go to lick sang Good ol lick sang and get the lick sang.

532
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:53,534
Speaker 1: that's dead now.

533
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:54,036
Speaker 0: Yeah.

534
00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:59,373
Speaker 0: Yeah and buy the USB to NES SNES Sega Genesis adapters.

535
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:07,060
Speaker 1: They actually are selling now NES SNES to GameCube adapters that you can use on the Wii.

536
00:38:07,823 --> 00:38:12,540
Speaker 1: So if you want to use your NES controller to play a virtual console game, you can do that.

537
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:16,020
Speaker 0: I am so about that you go buy them then I probably will.

538
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,598
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's pretty best.

539
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:19,322
Speaker 1: I think that's.

540
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:33,480
Speaker 1: the number one advantage of the virtual console is that you can play these games with Controllers that don't suck with real d-pads and real buttons that don't fuck up all the time Yeah, plus just the fact you don't have to configure them or anything like in the emulator.

541
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,909
Speaker 1: You always have to set the buttons.

542
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,995
Speaker 1: Yeah buttons are set.

543
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:36,579
Speaker 1: You're good to go.

544
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:48,388
Speaker 0: Any time we wanted to play emulated games Even when we had the old div with Linux and the good emulators on it every time we wanted to play We still had to sit down fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle play Mm-hmm, and then we could play for an hour.

545
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:50,840
Speaker 0: We had to do that initial fiddle every time we wanted to play.

546
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,813
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's like the virtual console.

547
00:38:54,094 --> 00:38:55,440
Speaker 1: the games are overpriced.

548
00:38:55,903 --> 00:39:03,600
Speaker 1: So you really had to be selective and saying okay This game is worth this slightly high price because it's convenient and there's no other way.

549
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:08,182
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get this game and it's a really good game, but any other game like Zelda 1.

550
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,609
Speaker 1: I really like Zelda 1.

551
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:11,600
Speaker 1: I have Zelda 1 on that GameCube disc.

552
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:15,540
Speaker 1: I have Zelda 1 and some other places, you know, so it's not worth 5 bucks.

553
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:20,020
Speaker 1: But even if I didn't have Zelda 1 in those places still wouldn't pay 5 bucks.

554
00:39:20,284 --> 00:39:28,235
Speaker 0: No, no See the thing is a lot of games like that When I can buy the old Gameboy Color or GBA version of that game.

555
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:29,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can get for like 10 bucks.

556
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,430
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna pay 5 bucks to get it just on my week.

557
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:41,630
Speaker 1: Yep, you can get the GBA version of Zelda 1 Because I originally released that at 20 bucks, which is insane and they went down to 15 down to 10. now I think you can get it for five.

558
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:42,094
Speaker 1: Yeah.

559
00:39:42,538 --> 00:39:47,140
Speaker 0: Yeah See it just comes down to the fact that again the DS is for many people a primary console.

560
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:57,100
Speaker 0: So if you have a game for the DS or you can get it for the DS There's no reason in the goddamn world to get it for the Wii Because you can just play the DS in your living room just as easily as you can play the Wii.

561
00:39:57,182 --> 00:39:58,943
Speaker 1: Yeah Here's an example I screwed up.

562
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:02,760
Speaker 1: is I got trauma center for the Wii because it was so good on the DS.

563
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:09,380
Speaker 1: But I didn't realize that the Wii version was the DS version with some more stuff in it like a third more stuff.

564
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:12,700
Speaker 1: So now I got to get rid of the DS version because I don't need it anymore.

565
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:15,172
Speaker 0: See that's great for me because I never played the DS version.

566
00:40:15,192 --> 00:40:18,993
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna know I'm just gonna play the Wii version cuz it's better.

567
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:19,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is better.

568
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,709
Speaker 1: It's actually easier to play and has more stuff in it.

569
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,713
Speaker 0: It's not often.

570
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:26,787
Speaker 0: I'll complain about a game being too hard God damn.

571
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:27,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, God damn.

572
00:40:28,017 --> 00:40:28,320
Speaker 1: anyway.

573
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:38,799
Speaker 0: ice hockey ice hockey is perhaps one of the most Ultimate and perfect tests of manhood that two men can use to determine the length of their manhood.

574
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:43,895
Speaker 1: You gotta understand this is a game where you have five players one of which is a goalie.

575
00:40:44,356 --> 00:40:46,830
Speaker 1: the other four players You can configure.

576
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,448
Speaker 1: you can either make them skinny medium or fatty.

577
00:40:50,649 --> 00:41:01,040
Speaker 0: now before we continue the issue as To the optimal loadout for your team has been perhaps one of the most hotly debated topics in the history of the NES.

578
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:04,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean arguments would come to fisticuffs over this.

579
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:08,505
Speaker 1: now It seems that you know any Logical argument people.

580
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:09,889
Speaker 1: it seems to come down to.

581
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:13,640
Speaker 1: you need one skinny guy because the skinny guy wins face-off.

582
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,027
Speaker 1: So you have to have a skinny guy.

583
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:17,660
Speaker 1: and I have always stood.

584
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:20,429
Speaker 0: I always use fat guys for my face-offs, but that's just me.

585
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:23,117
Speaker 1: Oh, well skinny guys do better face-offs.

586
00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:23,940
Speaker 1: That's in the game.

587
00:41:25,022 --> 00:41:28,457
Speaker 0: All I'm saying is that it's not always to your advantage to win the face-off.

588
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:28,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

589
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:33,120
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, the medium guys are medium at everything.

590
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:42,700
Speaker 1: So whatever the fat guys are really good at shooting and they're really hard to knock down But they're slow as shit like it'll take you forever to get down the ice with those guys.

591
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:45,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz remember the skinny guys are real real real real real quick.

592
00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:50,600
Speaker 0: And the fact that the thing is the fat guys don't shoot harder by default They just can charge up longer and shoot a harder shot.

593
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,520
Speaker 1: Well, no in the same amount of charge up time a fat guy will shoot a harder shot.

594
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:59,122
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but in general harder shot doesn't mean a lot It does.

595
00:41:59,243 --> 00:42:01,670
Speaker 1: it depends, you know and the speed of the game.

596
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,411
Speaker 1: if you're playing on low speed hard shot can mean a lot But no one plays on low speed.

597
00:42:06,472 --> 00:42:07,600
Speaker 0: low speed is for losers.

598
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:12,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing is that while high-speed might seem like an advantage.

599
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:18,120
Speaker 1: for the skinny guys It can often turn into a disadvantage making them harder to control in the high-speed games.

600
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:31,689
Speaker 0: See now the loadout I have used since I was a little child and I used to this day with great success is Three fat guys and one skinny guy because one if you ever pick the normal guy That just means that you're waffling.

601
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:32,614
Speaker 0: You can't decide.

602
00:42:32,855 --> 00:42:41,308
Speaker 0: you want both sides You can't commit to one thing and you don't need more than one skinny guy because that skinny guy will always be there the moment You need to get away with the puck.

603
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,235
Speaker 0: He's always there.

604
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:42,880
Speaker 0: He's always ready.

605
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:49,219
Speaker 0: The three fat guys form this impenetrable wall of defense that no guy will ever get through to score on you.

606
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,125
Speaker 1: See, that's an okay strategy.

607
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:52,848
Speaker 1: when I was a kid.

608
00:42:52,868 --> 00:43:05,911
Speaker 1: I used to play, you know, two fatties one medium one skinny, but Then like when we started playing in the college days I got bold and I thought I know I'll win with my skills and I won't need the fatty guys.

609
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:18,260
Speaker 1: and I've used two skinny guys and two medium guys and That will allow me to not always just get trampled by fatties because I got two medium guys And I'll have such skill with my skinny guys that I'll put it in the goal and sneak around all your dudes.

610
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:21,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, except the problem was that the medium guys didn't really do much for you.

611
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:23,966
Speaker 1: They work they worked.

612
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:29,240
Speaker 1: I won many games of ice hockey with that strategy, but now I'm leaning back towards bringing in some fatties.

613
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,459
Speaker 1: Haha, I don't know.

614
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:37,320
Speaker 1: I might bring in one fatty and then like two mediums in a skinny or a fatty and medium.

615
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,968
Speaker 0: It is telling you three fatties.

616
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:41,380
Speaker 0: one skinny is the absolute perfect team.

617
00:43:41,623 --> 00:43:53,536
Speaker 0: I don't know about that Just like how in Final Fantasy one the perfect team if you really want to beat the game super super powerfully is Fighter fighter red mage white mage and I'll stand by that till the day I die.

618
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:56,660
Speaker 0: two fighters Two fighters is nuts.

619
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,370
Speaker 0: You have no idea how nuts two fighters is.

620
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,820
Speaker 1: and then you gotta have a black mage.

621
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:02,183
Speaker 1: I don't see.

622
00:44:02,203 --> 00:44:04,160
Speaker 1: it's almost like cast all fur and lit.

623
00:44:04,461 --> 00:44:10,160
Speaker 0: You know what red mage can cast all the spells you need when you're low level and when you get to high level.

624
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:14,500
Speaker 0: Those spells are almost useless compared to the attacks of your dudes.

625
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:15,726
Speaker 1: Of course they're useless.

626
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:17,032
Speaker 1: a red mage is casting them.

627
00:44:17,052 --> 00:44:18,479
Speaker 1: if you had a black mage you can guess nuke.

628
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:20,905
Speaker 0: No Because the other party I used a great effect.

629
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:28,773
Speaker 0: was fighter fighter white mage black mage or fighter red mage white mage black mage Fighter black belt black mage white mage.

630
00:44:28,853 --> 00:44:31,265
Speaker 0: see the black belts, okay I have many reasons.

631
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:35,069
Speaker 0: I don't take him but I will point out as you take the thief You're retarded.

632
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,774
Speaker 1: you are retarded.

633
00:44:35,835 --> 00:44:40,215
Speaker 1: if you take the thief Oh, yes, I must agree you get to use the Katana, but screw that.

634
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:43,051
Speaker 0: the cotton is almost nothing And you can find two of them in the game.

635
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:44,419
Speaker 0: So it's not like it's something special.

636
00:44:44,902 --> 00:44:47,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, the black belt is definitely the awesome cuz.

637
00:44:47,593 --> 00:44:49,140
Speaker 1: well he starts out early in the game.

638
00:44:49,181 --> 00:44:49,858
Speaker 1: He's kind of weak.

639
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:53,494
Speaker 1: You can still pull him through and then as soon as he gets starts leveling up.

640
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:54,920
Speaker 1: god damn is he powerful.

641
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:56,044
Speaker 0: Except one.

642
00:44:56,064 --> 00:44:57,850
Speaker 0: not so much defense and two.

643
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:03,491
Speaker 0: you can do almost as much damage with a fighter with the right weapon Mmm, almost as much almost as much.

644
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:05,599
Speaker 0: that's the key close enough to where it doesn't matter.

645
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:09,190
Speaker 1: But then it's not the best if another one is slightly better.

646
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:11,719
Speaker 0: It's not because the fighter has so many other benefits.

647
00:45:12,861 --> 00:45:13,966
Speaker 0: Anyway one the fighter.

648
00:45:14,147 --> 00:45:17,542
Speaker 1: when he becomes a knight in ice hockey you have these guys All right.

649
00:45:17,562 --> 00:45:19,554
Speaker 0: So as goalie I usually use the black mage.

650
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:20,580
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

651
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,646
Speaker 1: They're gonna release like Mario.

652
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:25,954
Speaker 0: Oh run for how that would be tight.

653
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:29,702
Speaker 0: That would be so time easy characters Like like the three and three basketball.

654
00:45:29,802 --> 00:45:31,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want that so much.

655
00:45:31,725 --> 00:45:37,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would pay upwards at six dollars for that Six dollars.

656
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:49,170
Speaker 0: So see the other guy on your team You don't get to pick is your goalie and in the fashion of old-school sports games Moving the stick moves all of your guys.

657
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,815
Speaker 0: It moves your main guy precisely.

658
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:54,086
Speaker 0: it moves your other three guys in a very generalized sense.

659
00:45:54,508 --> 00:46:00,432
Speaker 0: Like you're holding up They'll kind of go out and it'll move your goalie straight up in two dimensions Mm-hmm.

660
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:03,864
Speaker 1: Well your goalie can go forward and back a little bit mostly goes up.

661
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:05,370
Speaker 0: That's why I said two dimensions.

662
00:46:05,592 --> 00:46:09,936
Speaker 0: Yeah, he can go up and down Two directions.

663
00:46:10,097 --> 00:46:12,028
Speaker 0: I said two dimensions, okay, okay.

664
00:46:13,012 --> 00:46:20,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, the goalie is kind of tricky because you know if someone's standing there with their stick raised up like they're gonna give a slapshot They could shoot that up.

665
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:21,844
Speaker 1: They could shoot it down.

666
00:46:21,884 --> 00:46:22,870
Speaker 1: You don't know where it's gonna go.

667
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,680
Speaker 0: They could also DQ pass and then shoot.

668
00:46:26,182 --> 00:46:34,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's really it, you know If you don't have defenseman just standing all over the place, which you can do by holding down one of the buttons.

669
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:34,732
Speaker 0: Nope, nope.

670
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:34,952
Speaker 0: Nope.

671
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:35,855
Speaker 0: That's not how you do it.

672
00:46:36,317 --> 00:46:40,710
Speaker 0: It says in the instruction to hit the button five times in a row.

673
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,963
Speaker 1: No It doesn't in the Wii manual that I read because the manual is.

674
00:46:45,043 --> 00:46:47,050
Speaker 1: that's another thing that's nice about virtual console games.

675
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,097
Speaker 1: It's the manuals for the games are built in.

676
00:46:49,117 --> 00:46:53,970
Speaker 1: I just read it and it says to hold down this button maybe?

677
00:46:54,752 --> 00:47:06,885
Speaker 0: Well according to multiple game faxes and multiple websites as I said the correct way to defend yourself on the original NES game At least is to press B repeatedly when you're on defense to gather players in front of the net.

678
00:47:07,146 --> 00:47:17,449
Speaker 1: Yep air the Operations manual for ice hockey on the Wii says if you press and hold one Which is B then players will gather in front of the net.

679
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,263
Speaker 1: However, I tried to play do that yesterday and I don't.

680
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,070
Speaker 1: I couldn't really tell if it was working, right?

681
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:28,230
Speaker 1: So we're gonna have to do some more experimenting to figure out if the operations manual is wrong or if they change the controls.

682
00:47:28,651 --> 00:47:33,150
Speaker 0: Yep, but case in point, I mean we can't really go into more detail because there's not so much to this game.

683
00:47:33,472 --> 00:47:42,425
Speaker 0: It's very other than raw unbridled Skill and passion and hurting your hands a lot and fighting via Nintendo finger.

684
00:47:42,806 --> 00:47:44,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of Nintendo finger.

685
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:49,970
Speaker 1: It's like Nintendo finger to get the face off Nintendo finger to win a fight Nintendo finger to do all kinds of shit.

686
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:54,310
Speaker 0: if you've got a Wii and You've never played ice hockey spend the five bucks.

687
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:57,319
Speaker 1: If there's one virtual console game you're gonna buy.

688
00:47:57,379 --> 00:48:02,172
Speaker 1: if you're only ever gonna buy one buy this one just you know Because it's so awesome.

689
00:48:08,882 --> 00:48:11,466
