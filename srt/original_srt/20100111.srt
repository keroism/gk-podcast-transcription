1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,626
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Monday January 11th.

2
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:12,489
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:17,360
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight our CES commentary roundup.

4
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:36,110
Speaker 0: So rim I see you Haven't put your pants on since what yesterday.

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're pretty much off.

7
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:38,880
Speaker 1: I had to put them on for work.

8
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:40,771
Speaker 0: Did you like not do any laundry?

9
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:42,180
Speaker 0: Oh you did put pants on for work.

10
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:43,960
Speaker 1: I figured for work.

11
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:53,799
Speaker 1: I should put pants on because No one at my office would have had any idea about this except for the fact that one guy was like Yeah, there are all these people on the subway yesterday, and they just didn't have any pants on.

12
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:57,318
Speaker 1: And I was like I was one of those people.

13
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,006
Speaker 1: What was going on?

14
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:00,633
Speaker 1: and I was like well, I just forgot my pants.

15
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:02,119
Speaker 1: I don't know what was up with all those assholes.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually on the stop right before Union Square yesterday.

17
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:16,639
Speaker 0: You know I also happen to forget my pants just randomly, but like The the co-worker that I work with the most just happened to get on the same exact subway car that I was on.

18
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:28,380
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day from our triumphant return was of course the improv everywhere International no pants day on Sunday, which as we said we participated in myself Scott Emily Judith and Natalie.

19
00:01:28,762 --> 00:01:31,759
Speaker 0: I think though it's gonna be a problem because like too many people know what's up.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,422
Speaker 0: You know this.

21
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:40,788
Speaker 0: it's hard to freak squares when like they saw it on the news this morning or something You know and people just come up and ask you like so you guys You stand on this train into Union Square.

22
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:41,531
Speaker 0: You're gonna transfer.

23
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:42,816
Speaker 0: It's like you know.

24
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:43,700
Speaker 0: There's no more.

25
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:45,105
Speaker 0: I forgot my pants.

26
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:54,738
Speaker 1: the trouble with that is that you still get people because remember for all the people that are hip in the City there are twice as many people who don't say anything, and there's looking at you like what the

27
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,832
Speaker 0: fuck It's true, but but it's

28
00:01:57,872 --> 00:02:04,040
Speaker 1: generally a hip and techie city So it's difficult to get away with any sort of large public flash mob.

29
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:10,180
Speaker 1: That's why the true great flash mobs of improv everywhere are the private ones like let's go to Best Buy.

30
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:11,431
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good one.

31
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:12,480
Speaker 1: That's still my favorite one.

32
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,819
Speaker 0: Well, just keep an eye on their website because I'm sure they do lots of New York action that we can be involved in.

33
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no pants was very near and dear to me.

34
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,443
Speaker 1: I mean we have our own custom no pants card and nanofictionary Mmm.

35
00:02:24,684 --> 00:02:25,509
Speaker 1: I should have brought that.

36
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:27,099
Speaker 0: oh yeah, right the no pants guy.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,023
Speaker 1: I didn't even think to.

38
00:02:28,124 --> 00:02:30,553
Speaker 1: we should have played some nanofictionary, but it's funny.

39
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:30,915
Speaker 1: How you know.

40
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:34,100
Speaker 1: they separate us into groups and It's always great.

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:46,829
Speaker 1: It's very rare for Scott and I to be members of the following crowd as opposed to the people organizing it like a con or An event like this mm-hmm, and it was cool to be in the audience of a group of people organized by someone Who is very competent at crowd control?

42
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,270
Speaker 1: Yeah?

43
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:48,516
Speaker 1: I mean he got everyone together.

44
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:49,520
Speaker 1: He did all the right things.

45
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:50,599
Speaker 0: It was so cool out.

46
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,927
Speaker 0: It's like all they had to organize this thing.

47
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:59,577
Speaker 0: it was basically one website and like ten generals with with Megaphones that was all they did to organize.

48
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:01,224
Speaker 0: like Thousands of people

49
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:12,772
Speaker 1: he walked around and he saw people who obviously had done this before and knew what was up And he made them like team captains gave them all a number and in a stroke of brilliance that I never thought of and I Plan to use this at every freaking anytime.

50
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:14,460
Speaker 1: I need to divide a crowd up, and it's large.

51
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:20,140
Speaker 1: He asked everyone to go to the number of the group that matches the last digit of their cell phone number.

52
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:29,354
Speaker 1: Yep, it was brilliant, so we all split up and in my group only works if you're dividing people up into ten groups Yeah, or you know if your number is even or odd.

53
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:30,258
Speaker 1: there's all sorts of ways.

54
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,677
Speaker 0: yeah I'm just saying it's you know.

55
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:34,633
Speaker 1: But I go to my group and the team lead there is like.

56
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:38,596
Speaker 1: so I need a volunteer to Basically go first and be the odd man out.

57
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:43,540
Speaker 0: I'm like yo Yep, and then I go actually originally scheduled to go second.

58
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:48,736
Speaker 0: But the guy who was gonna go first was he wanted to stay with his girlfriend or whatever.

59
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:49,378
Speaker 0: so that I was.

60
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:50,922
Speaker 0: I was promoted To going first.

61
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,213
Speaker 1: I basically got on the train and looked around and there were.

62
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:58,976
Speaker 1: there were a bunch of normies on my car When our group got on yeah surprisingly crowded for a weekend train.

63
00:03:59,178 --> 00:03:59,600
Speaker 1: It was great.

64
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:02,760
Speaker 1: I sit down I look around and I just say oh shit.

65
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,788
Speaker 1: And then I just take my pants off and put him in my bag and sit back down.

66
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,839
Speaker 1: like there we go And people just kind of look at me.

67
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:17,740
Speaker 1: I had a line so set but no one asked me when I was taking my pants off Why I was taking my pants off because I had this surreal stroke of genius.

68
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,785
Speaker 1: I wanted to say if anyone asked me.

69
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:20,507
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

70
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:25,950
Speaker 1: I just forgot I was wearing him Like Stephen Wright must have come to me from the grave.

71
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:31,476
Speaker 0: So I just got on the train and it was so quick into the next stop that I had to hurry up to take Them off quickly enough.

72
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,964
Speaker 0: you know I get was mostly getting the shoes off Getting the pants off getting the shoes back on getting the pants in the bag.

73
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:38,350
Speaker 0: It was it was difficult operation.

74
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:41,510
Speaker 1: It was great standing at that next stop because that we were the ones who got to stand.

75
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:45,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, so me and ram are standing like 20 feet away from each other on this subway platform.

76
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,300
Speaker 1: That's real nonchalant like he's standing there like just a commuter guy.

77
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:51,050
Speaker 1: I'm standing there playing my DS kind of spread eagle.

78
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:52,895
Speaker 0: It was cold.

79
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:54,581
Speaker 1: It was fucking cold.

80
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:56,710
Speaker 1: Good guy really cold, but it was great.

81
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:06,810
Speaker 1: I one by one like normal people would walk up and their little conversation would be going along and they kind of just Like stop talking for a minute and look around Giggle or something and then just try to avoid all of us.

82
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,995
Speaker 1: But they couldn't because there was one of us like every 20 feet Mmm.

83
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:12,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing was is like at the next stop.

84
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,505
Speaker 0: No one got on my car even though it was the same exact car that I got off of.

85
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:19,464
Speaker 0: so I was like uh-oh Did we mess up this or something?

86
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:19,847
Speaker 0: and then?

87
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:23,130
Speaker 0: You know eventually people did get out of my car.

88
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,517
Speaker 0: I was not like left alone.

89
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:26,950
Speaker 1: my car had a few extra pencils people yeah.

90
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,717
Speaker 0: And then was awesome is like Times Square because we only had people going down to Queensborough Boulevard And that was our entire group.

91
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:35,890
Speaker 0: right, but we got to Times Square.

92
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:37,477
Speaker 0: It's like perfectly timed.

93
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:43,721
Speaker 0: all these other people who I assume must have been on like the seven train Transferred onto our train from the seven.

94
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:46,150
Speaker 0: so it was like ah look at all these people just joined us.

95
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:47,870
Speaker 0: Awesome.

96
00:05:48,651 --> 00:06:00,223
Speaker 1: But one of my favorite moments was I got to the place you know Union Square And I went over to the Starbucks And there was like one guy in there other than me with no pants on and no one really noticed him except for a few People are kind of staring at him like that guy's no pants.

97
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:00,746
Speaker 1: What's he fine?

98
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:01,370
Speaker 1: What's going on?

99
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, that guy doesn't have pants either.

100
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,478
Speaker 1: That's weird, and I go up.

101
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:10,854
Speaker 1: I'm in line everyone's kind of looking at me, and I'm like I Need some coffee.

Speaker 1: I drank half of it.

106
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,239

Speaker 0: She was acting crazy And then she got off.

125
00:06:56,175 --> 00:07:00,314
Speaker 1: one guy in my car towards the end was like well shit if everyone else is taking their pants off He's took his pants off.

Speaker 1: He didn't.

130
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:07,464
Speaker 1: he was not in on it as far as I could tell.

131
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:13,749
Speaker 1: uh-huh You know I think everyone had the encounter where someone was like so uh what's the deal yeah?

132
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,610
Speaker 1: And I just looked at him like must be like what deal I was like what he's like.

133
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:18,755
Speaker 1: You're not wearing pants.

134
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:21,407
Speaker 1: clear something wrong, and I this is still in the Starbucks.

135
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:22,130
Speaker 1: I just got my coffee.

136
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,593
Speaker 1: I looked down.

00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:30,380
Speaker 1: I was like oh shit, and then I just walked out like in a hurry No pants was crazy awesome and everyone who missed it sucks.

138
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:32,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just I worry about the future.

139
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:36,381
Speaker 1: if too many people You know no pants will no longer be a freak the squares.

140
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,410
Speaker 1: It'll just be like a national holiday.

141
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we need to mix it up a little bit.

142
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:45,244
Speaker 0: It needs to be no shirt Just underwear only.

143
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,677
Speaker 1: I'd rather wait until at least March.

144
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,487
Speaker 0: We should also move it to a non cold time of year.

145
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:53,310
Speaker 0: You know it's the point.

146
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:56,028
Speaker 0: No, you know it's not fair right to Sydney right?

147
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:59,890
Speaker 0: Sydney Did it at the same day which means it was really nice and warm there?

148
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:02,209
Speaker 0: They should have to move there six months over.

149
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:03,092
Speaker 1: Yeah They should.

150
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:08,962
Speaker 0: or maybe what we could do is in compromise make it twice a year six months I think so everyone gets both sticks.

151
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:11,375
Speaker 1: It's not so bad You know what the people in like.

152
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:12,139
Speaker 0: you know Florida.

153
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:13,223
Speaker 0: They never have a problem.

154
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,538
Speaker 0: They're like yeah, it's Jamaica No pants day.

155
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,770
Speaker 0: what they have pants in Jamaica.

156
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:18,557
Speaker 1: It's not so fans.

157
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:18,818
Speaker 0: ever.

158
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:21,930
Speaker 1: if I was in Jamaica bad except for the fact that we were on the end.

159
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,144
Speaker 1: So we had to stand on the platform.

160
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:25,110
Speaker 1: That's above ground.

161
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:33,188
Speaker 0: Started with like the Williamsburg people we could have taken the L And it would have basically been like yeah, we're underground the whole time.

162
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:33,650
Speaker 0: big deal.

163
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:40,940
Speaker 1: I gotta say though it was funny that the crowd of people who showed up to do this Was very reminiscent of the crowd that showed up at PAX West.

164
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,707
Speaker 0: all people our age who are cool and hip.

165
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,890
Speaker 1: I mean We are no old people no kids our group.

166
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,370
Speaker 1: We were all arguing about homeopathy and all that stuff and then these two cute cool girls come over.

167
00:08:51,450 --> 00:09:00,530
Speaker 1: They're like hey, yeah, yeah, we heard conversation, and that's something that's kind of up our alley My name is blah, and we hung out and then this guy and this girl with two ferrets came over.

168
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:04,223
Speaker 0: Yeah ferrets did the ferrets take the pants off?

169
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:05,310
Speaker 1: uh?

170
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,952
Speaker 1: I don't know.

171
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:10,263
Speaker 1: I've never seen a ferret wear pants But maybe the fur counts in which case I don't want to see them.

172
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,631
Speaker 1: take that off mmm Cuz.

173
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,039
Speaker 1: there's kind of scraggly and wrinkly.

174
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:14,386
Speaker 0: go look on you.

175
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:21,070
Speaker 0: go on the internet We got to search for like hairless ferret always got to search for ferret and pants or hairless mongoose or something.

176
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,769
Speaker 1: At least we didn't miss the fancy pants parade.

177
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:32,670
Speaker 1: That song was stuck in my head for most of the event as was that Seinfeld episode with naked guy on the subway anyway.

178
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:38,650
Speaker 0: so This show that we're gonna do today is mostly about CES the consumer electronic show.

179
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,655
Speaker 0: But I want to talk about.

180
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:42,930
Speaker 0: is that Leo Laporte you know from the twit network?

181
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:44,718
Speaker 0: They did a big thing at CES.

182
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:44,919
Speaker 0: you know.

183
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:48,756
Speaker 0: he would always talk about how you shouldn't go because you can just read it All in a gadget, and there's no reason to go.

184
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:51,489
Speaker 0: yep, but he got sponsors that sent him there, so he went.

185
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:56,137
Speaker 0: and You know I was one day I was watching him live just to you know.

186
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:03,623
Speaker 0: see what he was doing at the CES and apparently he had the biggest number of Like live viewers he ever had ever during that time that I was watching.

187
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:05,048
Speaker 0: so something about it was.

188
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,138
Speaker 0: I think it was cuz it was Friday he was at.

189
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:07,801
Speaker 0: it was CES.

190
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:08,545
Speaker 0: There's a big event.

191
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:27,330
Speaker 0: He was live there I you know and I was watching him operate and I realized The only difference between us and him at this point right is a. he has a professional radio voice because he's a professional radio guy Right - he has sponsors and money to buy better equipment.

192
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:32,409
Speaker 0: now He doesn't buy super professional equipment like TV networks, but he has more equipment than we do.

193
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:34,155
Speaker 1: you know He's basically one step up from us.

194
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:37,065
Speaker 0: if I can buy multiple HD cameras.

195
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:40,240
Speaker 0: He can buy better microphones He can buy a caster.

196
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,552
Speaker 0: He could buy any number of computers He needs.

197
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:42,773
Speaker 0: right.

198
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:46,044
Speaker 0: he can buy wireless cards to get on evdo networks or whatever.

199
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:46,325
Speaker 0: you know.

200
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:48,194
Speaker 0: he could buy one cell phone from every Network.

201
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:52,121
Speaker 0: he's right yeah, and He has enough money to hire people to help him.

202
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:58,921
Speaker 0: other than that like watching him operate I was like oh my god It's just like when I had to run the panel all day at Connecticut.

203
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:02,049
Speaker 0: only he's running a podcast all day at CES.

204
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:08,370
Speaker 0: Oh God, I just I felt like I was at Connecticut again like he was talking about how the Convention Center is so dry.

205
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:13,694
Speaker 0: Hey, my throat is dried out, and you know I was like ah It was like I was.

206
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:16,767
Speaker 0: I was taken back right into Connecticut.

207
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:17,430
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

208
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:29,870
Speaker 0: So just knowing that he was doing going through that and he was doing basically the same thing I was like yeah, I can do everything he can do except have professional radio voice and have more monies.

209
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:40,909
Speaker 0: so If anyone wants to give us more monies and maybe give us some radio voice training We can put on a Leo Laporte show for you, please sponsor us.

210
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:43,900
Speaker 0: We can put on a show just as good as he can.

211
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:45,346
Speaker 0: we've done it before.

212
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:46,330
Speaker 0: we can do it again.

213
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:47,914
Speaker 0: Call me.

214
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:48,782
Speaker 1: I don't know.

215
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:51,636
Speaker 1: at the same time Think back to all those cons.

216
00:11:51,697 --> 00:11:54,550
Speaker 1: It's real fun, and we like doing this, but it sucks.

217
00:11:55,557 --> 00:12:02,218
Speaker 0: But if you get paid big money yeah, imagine if someone are you understand like what his sponsor is paid for.

218
00:12:02,478 --> 00:12:08,844
Speaker 0: they bought him a a Broadcasting platform right because there's all these broadcast platforms you can buy.

219
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:11,797
Speaker 0: you know like when you're at New York comic-con There's like up on the site right.

220
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,990
Speaker 0: so they paid for him to get a broadcast platform.

221
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:17,160
Speaker 0: They had a t1 sent to the broadcast platform right.

222
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:20,410
Speaker 0: so already that's so worth what right they paid for it.

223
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,780
Speaker 0: I have like these banners hung up.

224
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,868
Speaker 0: that was like to it at CES.

225
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,310
Speaker 0: They paid for you know advertising and all the programs it paid.

226
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:28,414
Speaker 0: Oh, they paid for it.

227
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:32,410
Speaker 0: They gave him a car to drive their plane tickets in first class.

228
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,641
Speaker 0: Well what I was thinking is to get the equipment there.

229
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,630
Speaker 1: We wreck ourselves at conventions anyway.

230
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:48,253
Speaker 0: So if someone paid me to wreck myself at a convention That's great, and they paid for the staff and the food and the went to parties and yeah, and hey We're going to PAX.

231
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:55,690
Speaker 0: if anyone would like to sponsor geek nights at PAX East slash West give us a broadcasting platform inside the email.

232
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:05,829
Speaker 1: Remind all of you will be doing a ton of panels at PAX East and if you have not pre-registered for PAX East yet Do it today.

233
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:08,343
Speaker 1: They're going to sell out I guarantee you.

234
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:12,741
Speaker 1: and for the talk about this tomorrow Yeah But I you know tech people is that you should go to PAX East to.

235
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:14,388
Speaker 1: the hotels are almost all sold out.

236
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:16,907
Speaker 1: get your hotel Right now or you're not gonna go to PAX East.

237
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:24,290
Speaker 0: yes There is a good chance that more than ten percent of the PAX East panels will be by us or associates.

238
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:36,086
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, well the good chance is pretty much a hundred percent But it might be as high as sixteen percent depending on what we find what the final contract is yeah It also depends on a lot of other factors that may or may not change.

239
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:37,212
Speaker 0: so yep We'll see.

240
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:40,070
Speaker 1: oh my god, but I do want to talk a little bit.

241
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:54,529
Speaker 1: There is a story about CES vendors being kicked out of their hotel rooms around Vegas during CES and supposedly what they were doing in the hotel rooms was Demoing products and and basically doing what they would have done on the floor of CES.

242
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:56,383
Speaker 0: They've always done this in their hotel room.

243
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:56,665
Speaker 0: this

244
00:13:56,705 --> 00:14:13,334
Speaker 1: all happens a lot I know, but the point is a whole bunch of hotels according to this report Kicked them out of their hotel rooms even the large like business suites and everything For on the grounds that they were using the rooms for this and no one can really figure out What the deal was.

245
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:20,268
Speaker 1: and people are speculating that maybe CES was going after the people who were doing this But not actually paying for space at CES.

246
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:23,790
Speaker 0: Well first of all I think the space at CES was sold out.

247
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,529
Speaker 0: I can't confirm that but um you know when you look at it They have multiple halls, and they're all full right.

248
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,763
Speaker 0: Secondly it is a common occurrence.

249
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,290
Speaker 0: This has been going on for a very long time.

250
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:41,330
Speaker 1: This is a normal tech conference thing like yes, even like tech conferences I've been to there's like hotel room suite parties and hotel room demonstrations.

251
00:14:41,551 --> 00:15:06,770
Speaker 0: Also, it's completely normal and not out of the ordinary whatsoever for what usually happens is if you have a really niche Sort of area of consumer electronics or whatever what happens is like oh yes consumer electronics shows in the convention center But actually some guy rented out the ballroom at the Sheraton and all like the audio file Companies are in there like this audio at CES, but all the audio file stuff is at the Sheraton.

252
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:09,799
Speaker 0: There's nothing to do with CES It's just they cuz CES.

253
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:17,009
Speaker 0: at the same time this niche Sets up in a hotel ballroom and pretty much every hotel ballroom is set up with some niche of CES.

254
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:24,303
Speaker 0: You know something that really wouldn't justify Getting tables at the big show But people who are into that will know to go to the hotel ballroom.

255
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:25,849
Speaker 1: people are reporting to that.

256
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:33,507
Speaker 1: Apparently all the vendors who were doing this who had rented floor space at CES had no problem.

257
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:44,269
Speaker 1: Oh Really yeah, I've seen multiple reports of that and this I mean I can't say I don't know, but it does reek of some sort of agreement between the hotels and CES.

258
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:52,830
Speaker 0: I think that somebody could investigate get a lawyer and maybe you know find some Bad competition something something.

259
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:54,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know that.

260
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:56,250
Speaker 1: I know I was reading not a lawyer.

261
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:07,150
Speaker 1: I was reading about all the weird laws about hotels and There are a lot of crazy weird laws about hotels and what they can and cannot do and when they're forced to give you a room And how they can't turn you away unless they think you're gonna.

262
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:12,330
Speaker 0: Then that's something I should learn because it's like I know all the rules of like what they can do if you're renting and what?

263
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,339
Speaker 0: They can do if you.

264
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,148
Speaker 0: you know.

265
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:21,990
Speaker 0: It's always good to learn about the rules of what someone can and can't do to you like what kind of cop do to you And if he stops you on the street knowing what a hotel can do to you.

266
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,927
Speaker 0: I think it's a very important thing that I must learn.

267
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:26,096
Speaker 1: Well, we haven't.

268
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:28,210
Speaker 0: what are your rights as a hotel guest?

269
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,978
Speaker 1: We only really need to know that if we decide to try to ever run big room parties I said the hotel on fire.

270
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:34,527
Speaker 1: Uh, I don't know.

271
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:45,237
Speaker 1: on one hand I'm kind of sick of room parties at conventions try to steal some towels But on the other hand It would be fun to put on a room party like in the old days at a convention like packs not like an anime con Cuz.

272
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:46,570
Speaker 1: no one's old enough to drink at an anime.

273
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:51,889
Speaker 0: I think our plan of getting a hotel ballroom for the night party and doing overnight gaming is all right.

274
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:53,315
Speaker 1: Here's the one problem with that.

275
00:16:53,616 --> 00:17:06,685
Speaker 0: If anyone would like to sponsor overnight gaming in a hotel ballroom at packs East or West or West geek nights at front road crew All we need is enough money to rent out the ballroom and rent a bunch of tables.

276
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:07,630
Speaker 0: We can take care of the rest.

277
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,869
Speaker 1: All I have to say to that is John Dvorak dot org slash blog.

278
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:22,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, if if Best Buy or some other company would like to you know Lend us a bunch of TVs and video game consoles for our overnight sponsor the geek nights at packs.

279
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:26,303
Speaker 0: Yes Geek that's appropriate.

280
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:26,464
Speaker 0: I go.

281
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:36,996
Speaker 1: No, so things of the day.

282
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:44,210
Speaker 1: the illustrious Daryl Surratt sent this to me and he basically said that Someone who had some shitty reporter job.

283
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,360
Speaker 1: This was his ultimate moment.

284
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:53,700
Speaker 1: He'd been waiting his entire life to write the headline and I quote Skywalkers in Korea cross Han Solo.

285
00:17:55,722 --> 00:18:13,698
Speaker 1: Apparently there is a high-wire championship in Seoul right now where they got I think 18 people who are professional like walk on the high high tightrope whatever guys and They're going across this river on this one and one point two inch thick wire, it's the Han River.

286
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,125
Speaker 1: Yes Yeah, and they do it solo.

287
00:18:16,406 --> 00:18:17,148
Speaker 1: It's our race.

288
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,355
Speaker 1: Whoever does it the fastest wins.

289
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:22,508
Speaker 0: Whoa What if you fall you fall in the river?

290
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:23,634
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, do you die?

291
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:24,619
Speaker 1: I don't know.

292
00:18:25,942 --> 00:18:30,319
Speaker 0: I mean if you're in the middle of the river, maybe you'll be alright because it's kind of shallow depending on how high you are.

293
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:32,698
Speaker 0: But I mean towards if you're near the edge.

294
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:39,758
Speaker 1: Oh To quote the article the iron cable was supported by 72 foot high towers on either bank of the river.

295
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:43,187
Speaker 1: a Safety net was deployed under the sections of the wire over the riverbanks.

296
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,519
Speaker 1: Otherwise, the Walker's faced a plunge into the swirling gray water.

297
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:48,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

298
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:49,794
Speaker 0: Well, it depends.

299
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:50,317
Speaker 1: how high was it?

300
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:52,088
Speaker 1: 164 feet?

301
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:53,196
Speaker 1: no, no, no higher than that.

302
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:56,955
Speaker 1: But uh, I'm not getting read the whole article.

303
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:57,840
Speaker 1: You can read the article.

304
00:18:58,181 --> 00:19:03,540
Speaker 0: However, I'm just questioning whether a fall into the water meant death or two people fell into the water and they did not die.

305
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:04,384
Speaker 0: All right, that's good.

306
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:07,497
Speaker 1: But it was a competition and I thought this is really cool

307
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:18,280
Speaker 0: reminds me I watched this video of that guy was bungee jumping and his friends were like, oh right when he was about to jump They're like, oh no wait, and they threw a rope over the edge to make it look like his rope and messed up.

308
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,886
Speaker 1: That's messed up.

309
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:20,892
Speaker 0: They're like.

310
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:22,180
Speaker 0: you thought you were gonna die.

311
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,611
Speaker 1: Wow, it was a kilometer long cable.

312
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:27,218
Speaker 0: Well, that's a big cable.

313
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,947
Speaker 0: Yeah Of course this cables a lot longer than that.

314
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:31,954
Speaker 0: They go across the whole ocean with internets.

315
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:33,820
Speaker 1: There are much more important cables.

316
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:34,887
Speaker 0: Yes much more.

317
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:35,431
Speaker 0: All right.

318
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:40,732
Speaker 1: I like the idea of Competitions like this just direct competition on something very specific and weird.

319
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:41,213
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

320
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:42,216
Speaker 0: What was the winning time?

321
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:43,802
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

322
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:45,774
Speaker 1: I didn't read the article and there's two pages of it.

323
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:46,620
Speaker 1: I don't want to click on next.

324
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:53,391
Speaker 0: I would have just ran because if I already have tightrope skills, you know It's all about the confidence and building up the the rhythm and the.

325
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,558
Speaker 0: you know, I don't know.

326
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:56,240
Speaker 1: It's a kilometer.

327
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,094
Speaker 1: Can you even run a whole kilometer?

328
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:01,705
Speaker 0: Oh shit Good god Cuz you're thinking of.

329
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:06,528
Speaker 1: like when you're trying to walk out of railroad tracks you start to fall You run to get as far as you can before you fall.

330
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:07,070
Speaker 0: exactly.

331
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,254
Speaker 1: gotta run a whole kilometer.

332
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:09,056
Speaker 0: Oh god.

333
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:14,694
Speaker 0: Yeah Surprised anyone made it 18 contestants from nine countries.

334
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:15,236
Speaker 0: No.

335
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:23,905
Speaker 0: Well, so There's a programming language called APL and if you'd have asked me like a week ago, like what's APL I'd be like It's a programming language.

336
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,020
Speaker 0: I don't know anything else about it other than there's a programming language called APL.

337
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:34,880
Speaker 0: But apparently APL is really good at doing like, you know grids and two-dimensional array type operations, right?

338
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:37,169
Speaker 1: Ah, like making 2d game.

339
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,445
Speaker 0: Well, basically like making the game of life and This is a YouTube video.

340
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:46,899
Speaker 0: a guy shows you how to make the game of life and basically one line of APL.

341
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:56,440
Speaker 0: And it's like you watch this and you know Like I don't understand that the specifics, you know of how APL works and all these things.

342
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,097
Speaker 0: But I you know, I can understand sort of I can follow him see what he's doing and it's pretty epic.

343
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:03,220
Speaker 0: and it you know.

344
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:09,079
Speaker 0: It makes you want to learn APL, but then you go wait, I'll never use that for anything useful But it's still pretty awesome.

345
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:14,140
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing if you're a punk kid and you're in some sort of tech school like CS or software engineering.

346
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:15,407
Speaker 1: Do stuff like that.

347
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:16,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it.

348
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,784
Speaker 0: this is an epic epic Programming video.

349
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:23,240
Speaker 1: So I think we just jump right into all the CES news.

350
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:31,084
Speaker 1: Obviously if you want to know all of the CES news or you want the details just go to like Engadget and read The text is there.

351
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:35,279
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk about how many pixels wide X was and how many jiggawatt?

352
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:41,100
Speaker 0: We are going to comment on how useless half of this shit is ha ha ha ha or how useful a very small portion of it.

353
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:46,358
Speaker 1: I gotta start by talking to how freaking awesome that micro vision laser projector gun was.

354
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:48,406
Speaker 0: All right Tell me about the micro vision laser.

355
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:49,210
Speaker 0: Basically good.

356
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,612
Speaker 1: It's the.

357
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:51,500
Speaker 1: it's this projector that uses lasers.

358
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:54,212
Speaker 1: So it's super focused like no matter where you point it.

359
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:56,000
Speaker 1: Every pixel is like a dot of laser light.

360
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:58,989
Speaker 1: It's like 800 by 400 something pixels.

361
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,212
Speaker 1: It's super bright.

362
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:00,834
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

363
00:22:01,075 --> 00:22:02,820
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing they're gonna stick on the phone soon.

364
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:03,839
Speaker 1: It's really really tiny.

365
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:10,120
Speaker 1: So to demo it they stuck it on a gun and they set it up such that the gun had motion sensors.

366
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:15,820
Speaker 1: And as you moved the gun around the room, it showed you what you would see in the game.

367
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:24,065
Speaker 1: It was basically like you had a gun and on the wall in front of you was always a screen showing you what was there In real time, but so but if you're looking up It's the gun.

368
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:26,540
Speaker 0: if you aim the gun at the ceiling you see you can see the sky, right?

369
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,017
Speaker 0: Yes, but if you're aiming at the sky with the gun, you can't really see in front of you.

370
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:37,320
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it was basically just an awesome demo of how crazy cool this projector is.

371
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:42,160
Speaker 0: It was pretty cool, but be even cooler is if it projected everywhere and then to the gun just controlled the gun.

372
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,646
Speaker 1: Well that that's the holodeck.

373
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,208
Speaker 1: that's next.

374
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:47,200
Speaker 0: see they already have that, you know, they've rooms you can do that in.

375
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not so great.

376
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:59,974
Speaker 1: I think my my bag is still with the augmented reality Mm-hmm, but this was just a cool tech demo and you know We talked about this almost a year and a half ago when the first inklings of this technology was appearing.

377
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:08,580
Speaker 1: but portable projectors Within the next year or two at anime conventions are going to be the most annoying thing in the world.

378
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:12,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much everyone projects of anime onto a wall somewhere.

379
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,597
Speaker 0: I mean they're worried now about like you sharing songs with your friends, right?

380
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:17,520
Speaker 0: or you know?

381
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,660
Speaker 0: I mean you read that FBI warning the beginning of a movie.

382
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:19,921
Speaker 0: You know what?

383
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:24,820
Speaker 0: It says you may not show this you may not have a public showing only private home viewing only.

384
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:28,520
Speaker 0: Dude, what happens when anyone can project any movie onto any wall?

385
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:41,739
Speaker 0: People are gonna go download a cam of like avatar Projected onto a wall with their cell phone in 3d and hand out glasses to everybody and watch it on like the side of a building And all the homeless guys will walk over.

386
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:46,016
Speaker 0: That is what they should be worried about and you know, what is nothing they can do.

387
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:46,920
Speaker 0: So worrying is useless.

388
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:47,750
Speaker 0: Don't worry about it.

389
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,317
Speaker 0: Just deal with it.

390
00:23:48,560 --> 00:24:02,785
Speaker 1: however it's gonna be pretty badass because the one thing is the anime con culture has the Some guy's gonna bring like his computer and like laptop and screen and everything to play like his stupid game and show people music videos or something and People are gonna like gaming.

391
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:05,420
Speaker 1: cons primarily aren't willing to deal with all that BS.

392
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:08,791
Speaker 0: We don't have to everyone cell phone.

393
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,220
Speaker 0: Basically, you'll turn yourself on sideways.

394
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:15,134
Speaker 0: It'll be a game controller and a projector simultaneously and you just pull.

395
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,607
Speaker 0: so your friend will pull out his cell phone Connect to you.

396
00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:18,636
Speaker 0: He won't even connect to you.

397
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,880
Speaker 0: I guess they might have to connect with bluetooth or Wi-Fi or something.

398
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:26,600
Speaker 0: And now you each have your own screen projected on the wall and you're playing a fighting game against each other or something.

399
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,146
Speaker 1: That is gonna be awesome.

400
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:31,640
Speaker 0: So you just walk up to you see bump into someone on the subway like hey, what's up?

401
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,664
Speaker 0: Hey, let's play a game.

402
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:35,018
Speaker 0: All right, you aim your phones at the wall and just play a game.

403
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:41,899
Speaker 1: However, once they're ubiquitous enough to where they're everywhere, you know Like you can assume that most cell phones have them like how most cell phones have cameras today.

404
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:44,208
Speaker 1: Go see it's gonna happen.

405
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,295
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah go see on the wall.

406
00:24:45,315 --> 00:24:54,460
Speaker 1: It's gonna happen a lot But we have to wait until there's that peak where they're not Common enough to where everyone's used to them like laser pointers.

407
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,320
Speaker 1: Remember when laser pointers first got popular and for like a year, they're just red dots everywhere.

408
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,492
Speaker 1: As soon as they got cheap enough when they're ubiquitous and novel go see everywhere.

409
00:25:03,593 --> 00:25:06,060
Speaker 1: once they're ubiquitous and non-novel that problem will disappear.

410
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:10,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, but people still use them for like a game on the wall or that sort of stuff.

411
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want to talk about all the different projection things beyond that.

412
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:17,835
Speaker 1: Portable projectors are going to be huge within the next year at the convention circuit.

413
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:22,592
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Okay, I guess I have to bring everything up.

414
00:25:22,632 --> 00:25:23,737
Speaker 1: captain forgot his laptop.

415
00:25:23,877 --> 00:25:24,460
Speaker 0: No, I got one.

416
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,036
Speaker 0: So there was this, you know guitar called the you rock guitar.

417
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:30,280
Speaker 1: Oh, that thing's pretty cool.

418
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:33,125
Speaker 0: So what it is, it's a guitar But it doesn't.

419
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:37,522
Speaker 0: you don't have to tune the strings and I don't think they break either because it's a MIDI controller It's right.

420
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,388
Speaker 0: See you play it like a guitar.

421
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:42,640
Speaker 0: you hold down strings and strum them and pluck them and whatnot, right?

422
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:51,867
Speaker 0: However, it's a MIDI controller so You can use it to control any MIDI anything and it just has USB cable that comes into it and plugs right into the front Of your computer and you're good.

423
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:56,510
Speaker 0: and it works pretty well with I guess the default Apple MIDI thing like.

424
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,899
Speaker 0: that's what they tested it with, you know.

425
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,149
Speaker 0: Secondly I'm pretty sure that you can play rock band slash guitar hero with it Somehow even though I didn't read how that works.

426
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:07,514
Speaker 0: It works apparently, right?

427
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:09,080
Speaker 0: So that's already two things.

428
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:10,073
Speaker 0: It does three things.

429
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:15,700
Speaker 0: it does Right, you can sort of like there's a there's a dial and you can dial up all these different instruments.

430
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:26,760
Speaker 0: You can play like, you know, even sounds that normal guitars usually can't make but you can like put it in like You know metal mode and go dah dah dah dah and you can put an acoustic mode and all sorts of you know modes.

431
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:29,038
Speaker 1: Does it have both squiggly and mealy?

432
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:37,352
Speaker 0: It has like ten squealies and ten mealy's and apparently you can download more squealies and more mealy's right because it's like it's you know Internet's.

433
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,789
Speaker 0: Then on top of that, it's got background music.

434
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:50,920
Speaker 0: So like you could put down like, you know, the blues, you know Or whatever or like some jazz and it'll go it'll just start making like a background music like doo doo doo doo And then it's up to you to play in front of that, right?

435
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:56,100
Speaker 0: So, you know you gets all sorts of backing tracks, you know, you could put like some, you know metal backing track.

436
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,740
Speaker 0: It'll like play a drum like digga digga digga digga digga and then you go.

437
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,567
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting in a lot of ways.

438
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,571
Speaker 1: I mean think about what happened with auto-tune and how we like more and more.

439
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:22,004
Speaker 1: celebrity singers aren't actually necessarily that good but you can make them sound good and eventually the technology is gonna get to the point to where you can have a fake guitar and if it like a microphone and Everything and you won't be able to tell that it's augmented and basically everyone will be able to sing Whatever is in their head

440
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:25,862
Speaker 0: everyone be able to be a rock star and sound like exactly what you know They imagine.

441
00:27:25,922 --> 00:27:30,740
Speaker 1: almost I wonder what that's going to do for a lot of culture and media.

442
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:43,539
Speaker 1: I mean, there's no way around it's gonna get to the point to where there will be people who everyone's a rock star Or no in the very least where anyone who has any idea in their head that is musical We'll be able to get it out.

443
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:51,049
Speaker 1: If Lee at least if it's single person music or maybe single person and backing tracks We'll be able to kind of get it out there in a listenable form.

444
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,903
Speaker 1: that is going to kill the majority of like generic Pop music.

445
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:56,787
Speaker 0: Well, I mean think about it.

446
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:59,680
Speaker 0: What if anyone in the world was good at programming?

447
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,794
Speaker 0: Well, there'd be no job for a programmer, right?

448
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:02,418
Speaker 0: What if you know?

449
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,480
Speaker 0: What if everyone in the world could make music them?

450
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,380
Speaker 1: You know job for musicians if everyone in the world was good at music if everyone in the world could play the every instrument?

451
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:24,780
Speaker 1: Very well, not, you know perfectly not virtuoso, but very well effectively even if they had no training You will drive up the demand for and value of the virtuosos the crazily talented and skilled people.

452
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:33,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you will destroy the market for anyone who is just really really exactly what I was gonna say Which you know what those virtuosos will be hired to do.

453
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:38,240
Speaker 0: They'll be hired to make the music and all that stuff that goes into the instruments that everyone else is playing.

454
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:39,987
Speaker 0: Right Dave.

455
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:41,580
Speaker 1: This is probably Dave Riley's paradise.

456
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:45,765
Speaker 1: He will just be singing non-stop for the rest of his life wandering around the city Maybe but he is.

457
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:48,259
Speaker 0: let me I didn't finish telling you about the things this guitar does.

458
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,715
Speaker 0: This guitar you can put it into you rock mode and what it does.

459
00:28:52,776 --> 00:29:10,620
Speaker 0: and you rock mode is Let's say you put on a backing track that's in the key of f-sharp, right and you rock mode it will disable all notes that are not in the key of f-sharp and If you try to play a note that's in the key of f-sharp It'll sort of make the guitar hero like you suck noise like growl, you know that that sort of oops noise.

460
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:21,344
Speaker 0: So you put it in this mode and you just sort of a met you to learn which notes are available and which ones aren't And you will always be in key Right, and it's all digital.

461
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:26,863
Speaker 0: so like your technique doesn't matter that much as long as you hit the right note and it just gotta Have rhythm.

462
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:30,660
Speaker 0: I think yeah, I mean, yeah, it'll be all your rhythm timing and hit the right note.

463
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:34,539
Speaker 0: It won't matter like, you know other things because it's a MIDI controller It's not you know.

464
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:34,781
Speaker 0: This

465
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:35,544
Speaker 1: is a good way to learn

466
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:38,878
Speaker 0: as a whammy bar to for like which pitch shifts if you if you whammy it

467
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,570
Speaker 1: you'll learn How to be a mediocre to average improvisationalist,

468
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:49,191
Speaker 0: but I mean and this thing is, you know expandable though, you know People are gonna firmwares this thing and but they really it's.

469
00:29:49,552 --> 00:29:57,040
Speaker 0: it's good to see someone actually take this technology That is incredibly old and actually push it to its limit or close to its limit or further.

470
00:29:57,683 --> 00:29:57,823
Speaker 1: Not.

471
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:01,177
Speaker 1: so they're not pushing it to its limit because you could do this a lot better in a studio you could.

472
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:06,760
Speaker 1: they're taking What is just good enough for consumers and making it mass-market and they're also make you know.

473
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,889
Speaker 0: But I think the things that they're doing are things that could have been done a while ago, you know They just weren't, you know, they could have.

474
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,400
Speaker 0: someone could have made a device like this, you know ages ago.

475
00:30:16,185 --> 00:30:17,030
Speaker 0: What are they gonna do?

476
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:24,840
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about this in depth So eventually it'll get to the point to where you can augment your own performances in real time to sound like whatever you want.

477
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:31,580
Speaker 1: What are they gonna do when I can perform stairway perfectly like Led Zeppelin entirely by myself?

478
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,426
Speaker 1: I'm not playing a recording.

479
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:34,570
Speaker 1: I'm performing.

480
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's that gonna do?

481
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:39,206
Speaker 0: I'll just record Myself playing stairway.

482
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:42,780
Speaker 0: I'll push I'll make an mp3 of me singing it and I'll listen to that.

483
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:44,346
Speaker 0: Listen to it.

484
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:47,718
Speaker 0: It's exactly the same as the original studio recording if not better.

485
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:51,940
Speaker 1: Here's the thing I would have to pay statutory royalties as a cover if I performed it.

486
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,003
Speaker 0: It's a lot like five bucks.

487
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:59,423
Speaker 1: However, if everyone just records their own version of everything that ruins Everything.

488
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:03,100
Speaker 1: when it comes to IP rights, it sure does but that's all pie in the sky.

489
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,740
Speaker 1: It's gonna be at least a couple decades before we get anywhere near that.

490
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,920
Speaker 0: We're still gonna get much closer in the short term.

491
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,680
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a lot easier for people to play much better music with a lot less musical talent.

492
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:22,860
Speaker 1: I foresee a lot more cosplay skits and an Improvisational fun like public things happening that are good as opposed to horrifying or no.

493
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,220
Speaker 0: It'll just improve the quality of no talent.

494
00:31:26,402 --> 00:31:35,080
Speaker 0: You know the same way that like, you know Like GTR turns the no talent driver into a doesn't crash or like a better camera can turn a YouTube video better.

495
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:36,900
Speaker 0: You know, it's that same kind of thing.

496
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:47,168
Speaker 0: It's like let's increase the quality of the tools make them easier such that the quality of amateur production will increase without Necessitating amateurs learning anything.

497
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:49,897
Speaker 1: what it really reeks of it's the idea of intelligent defaults.

498
00:31:49,937 --> 00:31:50,720
Speaker 1: taken to the extreme.

499
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,827
Speaker 1: It's playing default songs that are pretty good.

500
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:55,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got it by that logic.

501
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:56,780
Speaker 1: and acoustic guitar is Linux.

502
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,414
Speaker 1: You got to figure out all this bullshit about it.

503
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:00,399
Speaker 0: You gotta tune it.

504
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:05,736
Speaker 1: There's tablatures and that's even like the like my break someone using tabs.

505
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:07,000
Speaker 1: that's like downloading the rpm.

506
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,287
Speaker 1: You gotta compile that yourself.

507
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:10,260
Speaker 1: Mmm, so let's move on.

508
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:13,800
Speaker 1: Nintendo hinted that maybe they might possibly have Netflix.

509
00:32:14,922 --> 00:32:16,952
Speaker 0: Like hitting that Nintendo would have net.

510
00:32:17,073 --> 00:32:20,404
Speaker 1: and Nintendo was like, yeah The no one.

511
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:21,450
Speaker 1: there was nothing clear here.

512
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,616
Speaker 1: All I have to say is it doesn't matter.

513
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:23,460
Speaker 1: It's too little too late.

514
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:23,861
Speaker 1: There's no.

515
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:28,758
Speaker 1: no one who wants Netflix on a device doesn't already have another device to do it.

516
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:33,458
Speaker 0: at this point You know and it points out now people don't seem to realize is they don't look often at the US.

517
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:35,806
Speaker 0: Japan Divide on these things right?

518
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,531
Speaker 0: the Xbox had the Netflix.

519
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,337
Speaker 0: That's a US device.

520
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:40,440
Speaker 0: the ps3 had the Netflix.

521
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,468
Speaker 0: Does it even have it now?

522
00:32:41,528 --> 00:32:42,294
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it does.

523
00:32:42,354 --> 00:32:44,405
Speaker 1: Yes, three does I believe it got it late.

524
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:48,340
Speaker 0: if it did it got it after the Xbox did which is because they're Japanese.

525
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,335
Speaker 0: They don't have Netflix really and you know, they might have something else, but they don't have Netflix.

526
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:53,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not on their radar.

527
00:32:53,941 --> 00:33:01,314
Speaker 0: well, I think this is why Nintendo is is missing out on a lot of things because Nintendo of America, you know, we think about like Reggie and stuff.

528
00:33:01,374 --> 00:33:02,760
Speaker 0: Reggie can't really do that much.

529
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,039
Speaker 0: He doesn't make any games.

530
00:33:04,301 --> 00:33:05,305
Speaker 0: They know what's hardware.

531
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:09,179
Speaker 1: Nintendo of America has always known what's up and Nintendo of Japan often will.

532
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,420
Speaker 0: Nintendo Japan is where everything happens.

533
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,840
Speaker 0: Nintendo of America is basically just salespeople that just take stuff from Nintendo of Japan and market it in the US.

534
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:21,500
Speaker 0: They don't really have too much say in what gets made or how it's made.

535
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,440
Speaker 1: I mean look in the old days you had Nintendo Japan saying Americans are too stupid to play our games.

536
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,925
Speaker 1: We'll give them the easy modes.

537
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:28,446
Speaker 1: Now.

538
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:32,680
Speaker 1: You have Nintendo Japan saying why would anyone want to rent videos on a console?

539
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,248
Speaker 1: No one does that here.

540
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,020
Speaker 1: Why would anyone do it in America?

541
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:39,071
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Nintendo of Europe is the same way.

542
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:40,920
Speaker 0: It's basically just a selling company.

543
00:33:41,422 --> 00:33:46,880
Speaker 0: It's all salespeople and Nintendo of Japan makes everything and it's just up to them to sell it to Europeans.

544
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:59,020
Speaker 0: You know and I think in the longer run this is gonna start to hurt Nintendo because Even all these normal people who bought all sorts of Wiis and made them so much money are not buying that many Wii games.

545
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,749
Speaker 0: they're only buying like three.

546
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:07,098
Speaker 0: Wii Sports is Wii fits and Mario and Their Wiis are collecting dust and they know it.

547
00:34:08,483 --> 00:34:09,928
Speaker 1: Thing is they made a profit on all the Wii.

548
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:17,871
Speaker 0: Yes, but in the long run when they have to come out with Wii 2 People are gonna see there We won with this pile of dust and they're not gonna buy Wii 2.

549
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:20,360
Speaker 1: the thing is the normal people might the muggles my I don't.

550
00:34:20,741 --> 00:34:22,166
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

551
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,429
Speaker 1: Nintendo's real problem.

552
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:26,260
Speaker 0: They'll buy DS 2, but I don't know if they'll buy we.

553
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,601
Speaker 1: You know what?

554
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:29,516
Speaker 1: We shouldn't talk about Nintendo's problems because that is a Tuesday show.

555
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:30,000
Speaker 0: That's true.

556
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,339
Speaker 1: There's been a lot of augmented reality stuff at CES.

557
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:44,580
Speaker 1: I don't get into all of it but there are a couple of different like glasses and they all look stupid and they're pretty poor but I Really want augmented reality to be awesome, but it's at least five to ten years out sadly.

558
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:46,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean MIT has that thing.

559
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:53,760
Speaker 0: I forget what it's called But basically it to wear this big Electronic thing around your neck and it's smaller than this kind of thing has ever been but it's still too big.

560
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,320
Speaker 1: I really just want my glasses now to have a wireframe overlay so I can tag people as stupid or not stupid.

561
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, you only have two tags.

562
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:11,360
Speaker 1: Well, you know that would suffice for the majority of what I do Mmm, I mean second would be having the the Grand Theft Auto arrow pointing where to go when I'm driving or walking.

563
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:12,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need that.

564
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:13,915
Speaker 1: and then the stupid not stupid tag.

565
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:16,700
Speaker 0: Mmm All Right.

566
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,568
Speaker 0: So let's talk about this boxy box, right?

567
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:19,572
Speaker 0: It's really pretty.

568
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,580
Speaker 0: It's a really nice looking box, right?

569
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,263
Speaker 0: It stands.

570
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:25,420
Speaker 0: they made it that way so that it stands out in your home media center.

571
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,660
Speaker 0: You know apart from all the normal boxes that way it'll get attention to people come over to your house.

572
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:31,999
Speaker 0: I think that was a good decision for marketing and such.

573
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:34,871
Speaker 0: It's also pretty powerful box.

574
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,163
Speaker 0: It's gonna run boxy pretty damn Well, you know.

575
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:42,460
Speaker 0: considering that's all it's designed to do and if you just want to have boxy, this is not a bad idea.

576
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,169
Speaker 0: However, there is a problem with the boxy box.

577
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:48,300
Speaker 0: The problem is that all it does is run boxy.

578
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:49,404
Speaker 0: I could go and buy.

579
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:50,047
Speaker 0: it's gonna blow up.

580
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:53,000
Speaker 0: I mean all it does is run boxy, but it is cheap.

581
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,509
Speaker 0: It's only like they said it's gonna be like $200, right but for $4.99.

582
00:35:55,509 --> 00:36:04,302
Speaker 0: ish I can go get an aces triple-e 1501 which runs boxy just as well If not better.

583
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:11,959
Speaker 0: and also is a computer with Windows 7 which means it can do any anything like, you know run an emulator.

584
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:16,491
Speaker 0: You know run Windows Media Center extender, so it could be a DVR.

585
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:19,220
Speaker 0: it can do all sorts of stuff because it's a computer.

586
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,288
Speaker 0: It's basically a netbook without a with.

587
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:25,479
Speaker 0: that's not a laptop and you could plug it into your TV with H You know an HDMI cable.

588
00:36:26,502 --> 00:36:28,560
Speaker 1: Well, there's a lot of competition in this space now, too.

589
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,039
Speaker 1: I mean, there's that pop box that a lot of people are talking about.

590
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:34,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I mean there's a company they made this thing called the new box.

591
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,679
Speaker 0: Basically, all it is is a netbook just like I you know a net top just like I said.

592
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:46,360
Speaker 0: only They just pre-installed pretty much every media program in the world on it and also there it is slowly.

593
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,738
Speaker 1: Actual televisions are having more and more of this functionality just built in even though they implemented shiddily and drme.

594
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:55,440
Speaker 1: It's there Mmm, and there's the problem that you know, well not really the problem.

595
00:36:55,802 --> 00:37:01,100
Speaker 1: I was looking at the Mac minis because I was thinking you know Maybe buy the new Mac mini at some point get rid of the old one.

596
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:08,219
Speaker 1: I don't know what to do yet But they very clearly and prominently suggest on the Mac mini site and Apple now hook it up to your TV.

597
00:37:08,582 --> 00:37:12,366
Speaker 1: It's an amazing media PC Mmm, and it is.

598
00:37:12,386 --> 00:37:13,351
Speaker 1: I mean it really is.

599
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:13,512
Speaker 1: it's.

600
00:37:13,612 --> 00:37:19,260
Speaker 1: it's more expensive than everything else But it has some of the most beautiful form factor there is for that sort of thing.

601
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:24,700
Speaker 0: The thing is I think the aces is a better choice than the Mac mini right now because it has windows 7 emulato.

602
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:31,341
Speaker 0: It can do more than the Mac mini can do right and it's cheaper by like over $100.

603
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:34,031
Speaker 1: The only thing the Mac minis got going right now is the.

604
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:35,818
Speaker 0: the aces has an HDMI output.

605
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:42,199
Speaker 0: with the Mac mini you need to get like a mini display port to HDMI converter and a special optical audio cable and a.

606
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,271
Speaker 1: All the Mac minis got going for it.

607
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,880
Speaker 1: Is that OS X is really pretty though?

608
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,639
Speaker 1: That's not really a deal maker right there.

609
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:53,336
Speaker 1: And the form factor is perfect because it's completely a hundred percent silent and tiny.

610
00:37:53,497 --> 00:37:54,660
Speaker 0: the other the other one smile.

611
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,363
Speaker 0: It's silent tiny.

612
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:56,770
Speaker 1: Also, is it actually silent?

613
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:57,976
Speaker 1: A lot of people said it's not.

614
00:37:58,017 --> 00:37:58,660
Speaker 1: it makes a little word.

615
00:37:58,961 --> 00:37:59,242
Speaker 0: I don't know.

616
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:00,005
Speaker 0: I had to go listen to.

617
00:38:00,046 --> 00:38:02,195
Speaker 0: I don't know either but it looks silent and tiny to me.

618
00:38:02,476 --> 00:38:03,380
Speaker 1: It looks silent.

619
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:07,554
Speaker 1: So I want to talk about this really quick.

620
00:38:08,016 --> 00:38:08,640
Speaker 1: the Zomteather.

621
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,297
Speaker 0: Oh wait I forgot one thing though about the boxy box the boxy box remote control.

622
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:14,240
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

623
00:38:14,722 --> 00:38:17,834
Speaker 0: Ah, if they don't sell that fucker separately, I swear to God.

624
00:38:17,894 --> 00:38:26,306
Speaker 0: basically what it is on one side It's you know four arrows with a button in the middle You know just like the Mac mini the the Apple remote sort of only a little bit bigger.

625
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:30,752
Speaker 0: on the other side is a keyboard Genius.

626
00:38:30,773 --> 00:38:35,250
Speaker 0: why do we have that stupid full-sized, you know wireless keyboard in the living room all this time?

627
00:38:35,351 --> 00:38:39,115
Speaker 0: We could have had a remote control like that because that remote didn't exist yet Even though it should have.

628
00:38:39,557 --> 00:38:44,390
Speaker 0: Oh God if they sell that remote control separately I might just buy two and if they don't sell it separately.

629
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,683
Speaker 1: I might just buy a boxy box because you get the fucking remote control.

630
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:51,960
Speaker 1: I'll sell the boxy box on eBay With boxy box no remote control.

631
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,024
Speaker 0: one hundred and fifty dollars.

632
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:54,329
Speaker 1: You don't need the remote.

633
00:38:57,191 --> 00:39:00,356
Speaker 1: So the Zom wireless tether all it is Bluetooth device.

634
00:39:00,596 --> 00:39:02,859
Speaker 1: you you link it to your phone or something.

635
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,586
Speaker 1: if you get too far away from your phone and starts beeping to remind you that you left your fucking phone behind.

636
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:09,890
Speaker 1: Oh, I think that's a pretty cool.

637
00:39:10,695 --> 00:39:11,340
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

638
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,730
Speaker 0: So what if you forget the tether?

639
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,494
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

640
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:15,679
Speaker 1: I didn't look into it more than that.

641
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,347
Speaker 1: You put the tether on your keychain.

642
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,389
Speaker 0: Ah What if you get your keys?

643
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,210
Speaker 1: Well, maybe get two tethers and tether them together.

644
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:26,250
Speaker 0: I guess one thing that's good about it though is like if you know it also acts as a speakerphone.

645
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:32,040
Speaker 0: Okay, one thing that is good about it is like, okay Let's see you have the phone but you forgot your keys, right?

646
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,924
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll be.

647
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,194
Speaker 0: if you have the keys and forgot the phone It'll beep.

648
00:39:35,636 --> 00:39:37,770
Speaker 0: so you can't go wrong in both directions.

649
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:45,204
Speaker 1: Of course if you forget all of your do everything at the same time You're in the I'm one step away from being a hobo situation.

650
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:46,227
Speaker 1: There's really nothing you can do.

651
00:39:46,288 --> 00:39:49,630
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah I'm gonna get stuck outside and not be able to call anybody.

652
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:56,410
Speaker 1: You know what I realized if it weren't for the fact that I Almost know Emily's number by heart like I could probably dial.

653
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,694
Speaker 0: I don't know anyone's phone number.

654
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:06,244
Speaker 1: if I was like out somewhere like in the street and I lost my wallet and my cell phone There is almost no way for me to get help.

655
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:07,650
Speaker 1: No, not really.

656
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:13,394
Speaker 1: I would usually have to go to a Starbucks beg them beg someone to let me use their computer to get on my email and Message someone.

657
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:15,364
Speaker 1: Oh, no public library.

658
00:40:15,565 --> 00:40:16,450
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea.

659
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,278
Speaker 0: Just go find a computer with a web browser and you're okay.

660
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:27,465
Speaker 1: magic Jack has that femtocell which is I Don't know that whole thing wallet shady.

661
00:40:27,485 --> 00:40:34,070
Speaker 1: I Foresee many many more things like that that are not magic Jack but are just nerds doing it on their own.

662
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:36,830
Speaker 1: Well my you know magic Jack made a femtocell.

663
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,450
Speaker 1: So basically your cell phone will sync to it with GSM instead of anything else.

664
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:47,850
Speaker 1: Yep, and then it's basically you can make calls like a real cell phone without any like no one knows but his voice.

665
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:49,454
Speaker 0: Yes, it is Some people don't realize.

666
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:53,630
Speaker 0: is that you know Verizon and Sprint with their CDMA of do whatever is right?

667
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,717
Speaker 0: That's all proprietary technology.

668
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:59,410
Speaker 0: If you want to connect to that kind of network, you need to buy chips from Qualcomm.

669
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:01,648
Speaker 0: You know the company Qualcomm, that's what they do.

670
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:07,949
Speaker 0: If you use GSM GPRS edge HSD PA that's all open source stuff, right?

671
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:15,242
Speaker 0: There Pete that there were like tech conferences in Europe where nerds just set up their own GSM networks Just you know and handed out SIM cards.

672
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:16,530
Speaker 1: now, you know, what's gonna happen?

673
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,750
Speaker 1: Especially if there's more white space in the spectrum and all that sort of stuff?

674
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:26,893
Speaker 1: we're gonna get to the point where either nerds just put open femto cells all over the place connected to the internet or I don't know.

675
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:30,010
Speaker 1: the possibilities are endless and I don't want to sidetrack the whole show with them.

676
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,261
Speaker 1: But that is cool and magic.

677
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:32,623
Speaker 1: Jack.

678
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:41,455
Speaker 1: while they reek of shady They seem to do what they say they do and that sort of thing is gonna completely screw Verizon and Sprint in the long run.

679
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:46,187
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially because now Verizon saying yeah, no more unlimited plans possibly.

680
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:49,375
Speaker 0: Well, another thing is that The femto cells.

681
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:55,582
Speaker 0: the original idea was that like, you know, okay, I'm an AT&T customer But they don't really have service so much in my apartment.

682
00:41:55,602 --> 00:41:57,250
Speaker 0: Maybe it's blocked by the walls or something.

683
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,604
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I go and get a femto cell.

684
00:41:59,644 --> 00:42:00,489
Speaker 0: put it in my apartment.

685
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:08,240
Speaker 0: now I have good coverage of my apartment - the problem is they wanted the customer to buy the femto cell Right and then keep it in their apartment.

686
00:42:08,261 --> 00:42:09,266
Speaker 0: It's like, excuse me.

687
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:10,010
Speaker 0: You've got it wrong.

688
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:17,730
Speaker 0: You you should give me half off my plan for installing a femto cell and donating my electricity To your freaking network or not?

689
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:25,596
Speaker 1: Just that the idea that just give them away for free to anyone who wants them and then you basically Increased your network a lot.

690
00:42:25,797 --> 00:42:32,224
Speaker 0: You're not without having to wait for a lot less than the expense of building towers - yep In fact have multiple levels have like a tiny one.

691
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:33,130
Speaker 1: That's just in a house.

692
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,055
Speaker 1: It's kind of low-powered.

693
00:42:34,457 --> 00:42:37,070
Speaker 1: have a more powerful one for nerds that just goes on the roof.

694
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,250
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, you find out where someone's living before you figure out which one you're gonna give them.

695
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:45,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think you say you live in a neighborhood with nimby So you get bad cell service because no one will let him build a cell tower.

696
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:48,215
Speaker 1: if you live there Just have a roof tile.

697
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:51,046
Speaker 1: That's actually a femto cell and now you've got great cell coverage.

698
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:54,234
Speaker 1: Yep All that stuff is cool.

699
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:55,718
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

700
00:42:55,758 --> 00:42:57,865
Speaker 1: There's the Ford sinking Google stuff.

701
00:42:57,885 --> 00:42:58,828
Speaker 1: They talked more about that.

702
00:42:58,868 --> 00:42:59,650
Speaker 1: There were some demos.

703
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:05,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Ford sink is looking like you're finally gonna have basically a computer in your car that you know.

704
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,877
Speaker 0: Does everything that your computer does.

705
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,950
Speaker 0: you can check your emails and your sports and two items of note?

706
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:23,903
Speaker 1: The long run of this is cars that talk to each other and you'll basically have real-time traffic data That is accurate and rerouting and all that stuff and you'll have an ad hoc network effectively of all the cars which alleviates a lot of problems with coverage.

707
00:43:23,943 --> 00:43:24,928
Speaker 1: internet in the car all the time.

708
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:30,490
Speaker 1: and As far as I can tell there's a podcast button or channel to start.

709
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:37,968
Speaker 1: I think we're finally getting to the point to where in cars which is where most People who aren't in major cities with mass transit listen to the radio.

710
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:43,089
Speaker 1: now We'll be able to just listen to a podcast like it's radio and not know that it's not radio.

711
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:49,950
Speaker 0: Yeah That's you know, that was the thing I wanted for podcasting all along was you know, it needs to just be on-demand audio.

712
00:43:50,071 --> 00:43:58,570
Speaker 0: You know someone browses through a directory of audio content pushes a button It just plays immediately and all the content is in the library all the time that not even just that with these cars.

713
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:05,090
Speaker 1: It's also got to have these serious equivalent where someone makes podcast quote-unquote stations that aren't live or anything.

714
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,490
Speaker 1: It's just playing something all the time and people smell a lot of satellite radio.

715
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,778
Speaker 0: There are channels that just play podcasts in order.

716
00:44:10,938 --> 00:44:11,179
Speaker 0: Yep.

717
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:14,230
Speaker 1: We looked into doing serious long time ago, which is only pain.

718
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:19,430
Speaker 1: It was too much of a hassle to conform to the standard to fit like in the time slots and stuff.

719
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,305
Speaker 0: They also support things like stitcher.

720
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:26,150
Speaker 0: with stitcher What you can do is like let's say you know that you drive an hour in the morning and an hour on the way home.

721
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:40,550
Speaker 0: Right with stitcher you can be like, yeah I want to listen to the traffic for this area then the weather then this news guy then this news guy then You know this, you know band and then and then it basically puts together every day.

722
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:42,562
Speaker 0: You know the thing for you to listen to.

723
00:44:42,582 --> 00:44:43,770
Speaker 1: stitcher is pretty cool.

724
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,670
Speaker 1: I actually I've been using down my pre through the beta and everything and we should interview them.

725
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,095
Speaker 1: Actually, I've emailed him a bunch of time.

726
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:53,510
Speaker 1: No, did you cuz way back when their podcast like directory had almost nothing I wanted in it.

727
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,944
Speaker 1: I was like your thing sucks and I listed like everything I wanted to listen to.

728
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:58,330
Speaker 1: they didn't have that day.

729
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,893
Speaker 1: They emailed me.

730
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:00,744
Speaker 1: They're like, those are all added anything else we should add.

731
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:04,179
Speaker 1: Yeah No, and they're like any suggestions anything anything.

732
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:06,750
Speaker 1: and they're like, yeah, it looks like you do a radio show blah blah blah.

733
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,793
Speaker 1: So they're cool people.

734
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:08,154
Speaker 0: Yeah.

735
00:45:08,877 --> 00:45:09,238
Speaker 0: All righty.

736
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's that mobile credit card swiper for the iPhone Brilliant.

737
00:45:15,235 --> 00:45:17,167
Speaker 0: Yeah, can I say really been around for a while?

738
00:45:17,268 --> 00:45:19,697
Speaker 1: I know But there was something about it here.

739
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:22,345
Speaker 1: They'd announce something about it at CES.

740
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:22,927
Speaker 1: I don't know what.

741
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:23,670
Speaker 1: mm-hmm.

742
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:25,503
Speaker 1: Oh, I think this is a different one.

743
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:27,453
Speaker 1: No Regardless.

744
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:32,790
Speaker 1: I look forward to the day to where everyone has a card scanner or the equivalent.

745
00:45:33,253 --> 00:45:35,590
Speaker 1: And if I want to give money to Scott, I just swipe my card on.

746
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,204
Speaker 0: Why do we look at I'm swiping a card into someone's phone, right?

747
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:40,910
Speaker 0: Why don't we just bump our phones together?

748
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:47,690
Speaker 1: Seriously well because Bluetooth and every every information sharing thing like that has always been crippled by bullshit.

749
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:55,507
Speaker 1: yep, and This swiping a credit card is the only thing that's not crippled by bullshit because the credit card companies want you to swipe it as much as possible.

750
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,360
Speaker 1: Nvidia ion Demonstrated it's everything it lived up to be.

751
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,107
Speaker 0: Well, that's what's in that aces.

752
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:03,790
Speaker 0: I was talking about.

753
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:10,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically if people still don't know I've talked about it before I think the Nvidia ion is a GPU.

754
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:11,615
Speaker 0: That's really cheap, right?

755
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:15,346
Speaker 0: It's not gonna run the latest and greatest games, but I probably play half-life.

756
00:46:15,646 --> 00:46:16,850
Speaker 0: It'll play old games.

757
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,157
Speaker 0: Yeah relative, you know, it might even play half-life - who knows.

758
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,090
Speaker 0: but what it is is a very low power very inexpensive GPU.

759
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,489
Speaker 0: So what you can do is you can get a cheapo computer like a netbook with the Intel atom CPU.

760
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,774
Speaker 1: We're talking on netbook.

761
00:46:28,814 --> 00:46:30,640
Speaker 1: That's like you can make a computer.

762
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,530
Speaker 1: That is the size of like my three harmonic is sitting next to each other.

763
00:46:33,731 --> 00:46:34,715
Speaker 0: Well, maybe not that small.

764
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:36,162
Speaker 1: I'm looking at a picture of one right now.

765
00:46:36,202 --> 00:46:37,308
Speaker 1: That's that's this big.

766
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:38,895
Speaker 1: Okay It's the entire computer.

767
00:46:39,157 --> 00:46:41,770
Speaker 0: So and then you put the Nvidia ion GPU next to it.

768
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,440
Speaker 0: It doesn't use that much more electricity.

769
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,050
Speaker 0: So your battery life isn't gonna get killed.

770
00:46:45,130 --> 00:47:01,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but you now have a GPU which means that if you're gonna use your netbook for things like watching Flash videos right watching any sort of video that can be accelerated by the GPU doing anything HD Doing anything with only a little bit of 3d in it.

771
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,363
Speaker 0: now you can do it.

772
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:13,770
Speaker 0: You can have a really low power Cheap inexpensive tiny computer that could actually like play HD videos that you downloaded from iTunes or whatever.

773
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:15,225
Speaker 0: That is crazy.

774
00:47:15,286 --> 00:47:18,758
Speaker 0: It's like You know, it's not like a Ferrari.

775
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:28,130
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's almost like a Taurus SHO, you know It looks like a normal slow black car, but secretly it's pretty fast.

776
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:35,441
Speaker 0: Not Ferrari fast not Porsche fast, but like, you know Mustang fast, but doesn't look like a Mustang at all.

777
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:37,290
Speaker 0: It looks like a Pete looks like a piece of crap.

778
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:41,186
Speaker 0: There's the and cotton, you know only cost what a piece of crap costs.

779
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:44,379
Speaker 1: also Open peak made an atom-powered.

780
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,270
Speaker 1: They call it the pro frame VoIP phone.

781
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:48,978
Speaker 1: It's like it's a business e VoIP phone like all those VoIP phones.

782
00:47:49,038 --> 00:47:50,262
Speaker 0: I mean, have you seen true phone?

783
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:52,870
Speaker 1: I believe yes true phone.

784
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:56,351
Speaker 0: It's like TRU phone and a lot of people in Europe use it Apparently.

785
00:47:56,391 --> 00:47:59,181
Speaker 0: what it is is I think it's an app you can get for most.

786
00:47:59,301 --> 00:48:07,009
Speaker 0: I think it's on iPhone and it's iPhone Android web, I forget which ones it's on and which ones is not on but they want it to be on all of them.

787
00:48:07,029 --> 00:48:16,189
Speaker 0: and Basically, what it does is you know, you can you know have Skype and then you can call Skype people for free But then you got to pay for anyone else.

788
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,439
Speaker 1: No this is like a VoIP phone to replace my VoIP phone.

789
00:48:18,459 --> 00:48:25,241
Speaker 1: the one up there and every business e VoIP phone is Has the old-school interface that old-school business people are used to.

790
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:33,323
Speaker 1: this one has a big color touchscreen Multi-touch icons like all the user interface that I want my phone.

791
00:48:33,363 --> 00:48:39,210
Speaker 1: if I want to dial someone's number and I don't know their number I have to type their name in like I'm texting it just awful.

792
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:41,036
Speaker 0: Now what the true phone does?

793
00:48:41,056 --> 00:48:45,290
Speaker 0: it lets you call Skype for free unless you call a gizmo for free.

794
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:50,170
Speaker 0: It lets you call without anything anyone that it can call for free over some sort of VoIP.

795
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:56,150
Speaker 0: It will call for free and if it has to use the actual phone lines, then they'll charge you money.

796
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:01,809
Speaker 0: But what they charge to call anyone in the US on any phone, you know calls to any phone in the?

797
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:03,095
Speaker 0: u.s Like three cents a minute.

798
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:13,769
Speaker 0: So people in the in Europe are like true phone Using that for my international calls or even you know non international calls because it's just incredibly cheap for the.

799
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:20,515
Speaker 0: you know Even when it does charge you money and if it can make a free call for free it will every single time Which is pretty awesome.

800
00:49:20,596 --> 00:49:28,983
Speaker 1: So if you're looking to save money on lots of international calls true phone I think we should wrap this up with perhaps the most important part of CES.

801
00:49:29,064 --> 00:49:32,455
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm the in gadget crap gadget No and catchy.

802
00:49:32,796 --> 00:49:42,430
Speaker 0: So yeah and gadget goes around and they love to find, you know Well, they have the curves right which is the keeping it real fake Which is all like the the boot, you know the thing that looks like an iPhone, but it's not an iPhone.

803
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:45,042
Speaker 0: But that CES they do the crap gadget.

804
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:46,870
Speaker 0: They basically find gadgets that are crap.

805
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:53,770
Speaker 1: Those shoes that are ugly high-heeled plastic pink shoes that are also speakers.

806
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:55,780
Speaker 0: I think that they're only speakers.

807
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,989
Speaker 0: I don't think they're you supposed to wear them?

808
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently everyone kept asking them.

809
00:49:59,981 --> 00:50:01,347
Speaker 1: So do I wear them or what?

810
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:03,711
Speaker 0: Yeah They're.

811
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:05,517
Speaker 1: they're horrifyingly ugly.

812
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:09,290
Speaker 0: I don't understand why you would want speakers that look like high-heeled shiny shoes.

813
00:50:09,691 --> 00:50:16,489
Speaker 1: There's that finger ist which is basically a giant ugly keyboard to stick on your iPhone and then try to play it like a guitar.

814
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,053
Speaker 0: Alright, no.

815
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:23,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see the picture of the iPhone screen and they draw like a bunch of strings on it.

816
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like the polar bear television set is a stuffed polar bear with a television and it's.

817
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:29,050
Speaker 0: I think that's my favorite one.

818
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:29,713
Speaker 0: That's definitely.

819
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:30,516
Speaker 0: that was the first one.

820
00:50:30,596 --> 00:50:31,861
Speaker 0: It was the most obvious.

821
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:37,570
Speaker 0: but audience is that for I mean I could see like I think you're supposed to use it like a kids room, you know to make like a cute TV.

822
00:50:37,711 --> 00:50:39,930
Speaker 0: But they already have like, you know the Mickey Mouse TV or whatever.

823
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:44,691
Speaker 0: I guess I could see that being you're gonna get any television just put a cute bezel on it It's not.

824
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:50,524
Speaker 1: I could see that being in the like den of some sort of ultra modern fancy apartment.

825
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:51,586
Speaker 1: just cuz it's weird.

826
00:50:51,606 --> 00:50:56,645
Speaker 0: I Being in like the safari lodge as the TV set cuz it fits in.

827
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:57,448
Speaker 0: there's that wrist.

828
00:50:57,468 --> 00:50:58,972
Speaker 1: cell phone There's.

829
00:50:59,033 --> 00:51:06,683
Speaker 1: it's like this wrist like holster for your cell phone But the pictures of it show someone putting an entire freaking iPhone in there.

830
00:51:06,703 --> 00:51:08,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like gigantic.

831
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:08,669
Speaker 1: It's like a wrist.

832
00:51:08,689 --> 00:51:12,421
Speaker 0: brace On my iPhone might be wider than my wrist.

833
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:14,450
Speaker 1: Let me say mine is a lot wider.

834
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,116
Speaker 0: Yeah, mine is definitely wider than my wrist.

835
00:51:16,136 --> 00:51:17,140
Speaker 0: Look you can see it.

836
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:19,448
Speaker 1: My pre is even wider than my wrist.

837
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:20,698
Speaker 1: granted I have tiny wrists.

838
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:23,113
Speaker 0: I also have a very tiny wrist One.

839
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:23,475
Speaker 1: I don't get.

840
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:24,078
Speaker 1: that's on here.

841
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:26,190
Speaker 1: It looks like a good idea.

842
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:32,870
Speaker 1: It's a tiny DV camera that police officers can wear like on their chest to record everything they're doing.

843
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:34,114
Speaker 0: That's good.

844
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:34,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's great.

845
00:51:35,418 --> 00:51:39,110
Speaker 1: However, the company that makes it they called it the ghost scam.

846
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:43,768
Speaker 0: Okay Not a very good name.

847
00:51:44,432 --> 00:51:45,876
Speaker 0: Sure, it's not like the ghost cam.

848
00:51:46,097 --> 00:51:47,221
Speaker 1: It says go scam.

849
00:51:47,743 --> 00:51:51,034
Speaker 1: It just has really really bad Graphic design.

850
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:51,475
Speaker 1: on the ad.

851
00:51:51,515 --> 00:51:55,770
Speaker 1: it shows like this really old cop standing there with the thing kind of like photoshopped onto his.

852
00:51:56,482 --> 00:51:58,877
Speaker 1: It's bad But the product I feel like.

853
00:51:58,957 --> 00:52:04,309
Speaker 1: by law every police officer on active duty should have a camera recording everything They do while they're on duty except maybe peeing.

854
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,752
Speaker 0: hmm Okay.

855
00:52:06,992 --> 00:52:12,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't have a lot else to talk about CES why a lot of things went down at CES.

856
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:14,718
Speaker 0: You can go read all about him on the internet.

857
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:15,300
Speaker 0: Yep.

858
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,665
Speaker 1: 3d was making a big jump.

859
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:17,729
Speaker 0: Let's talk about some 3d.

860
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:23,088
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that because Nvidia has been on the 3d boat forever, but no one knows.

861
00:52:23,148 --> 00:52:27,130
Speaker 0: that's one You know, they're looking for any area in which they can sell you something new.

862
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:33,678
Speaker 0: It's like well if everyone if we can get everyone to start making 3d games and you need an Nvidia card to play those games In 3d at least.

863
00:52:33,939 --> 00:52:36,370
Speaker 0: then we will be able to sell a lot of Nvidia product, you know.

864
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:38,158
Speaker 0: And then we can also sell glasses.

865
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:40,349
Speaker 0: Well, you know, that's they're looking for.

866
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:48,250
Speaker 0: As far as 3d goes I think that the you know Like people are liking it right now because it is pretty awesome.

867
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:51,319
Speaker 0: You know If you're if you're the kind of person that it doesn't make you sick.

868
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:55,013
Speaker 0: and even the thing is even people who complain about it Making them sick.

869
00:52:55,735 --> 00:52:56,338
Speaker 0: They go see it.

870
00:52:56,398 --> 00:52:57,863
Speaker 0: Anyway, they say oh man, it was awesome.

871
00:52:57,884 --> 00:52:58,666
Speaker 0: But I got nauseous.

872
00:52:58,747 --> 00:52:59,570
Speaker 0: I would you do it again?

873
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like okay.

874
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:04,678
Speaker 0: and second of all People already have glasses.

875
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:07,250
Speaker 0: It's sort of problematic for them to wear other glasses.

876
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,521
Speaker 1: Yeah That's why they always make the things really big and you stick them in front.

877
00:53:10,561 --> 00:53:11,806
Speaker 0: and then there's the like.

878
00:53:11,907 --> 00:53:16,426
Speaker 0: I've never been to one That has these but some people go to the ones that have like the battery-powered glasses.

879
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:17,450
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there's the shit.

880
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,434
Speaker 1: Well, there's shutter glass.

881
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:19,619
Speaker 0: I've never used those ones.

882
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:20,925
Speaker 1: There's the polarized ones.

883
00:53:20,945 --> 00:53:22,110
Speaker 1: There's the red and blue ones.

884
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:24,210
Speaker 0: There's a people talked about like the ones of the batteries.

885
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,670
Speaker 0: I was like what the hell are you talking about?

886
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:28,259
Speaker 0: I've never seen one of the battery in my life But I guess they exist.

887
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,997
Speaker 1: people have said that those Give you the most options.

888
00:53:31,017 --> 00:53:33,450
Speaker 1: like you can make the best 3d with the shutter glasses.

889
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:34,675
Speaker 0: But how do you like?

890
00:53:35,036 --> 00:53:37,527
Speaker 0: if it's so it it's shuttering open and closed all the time.

891
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:38,230
Speaker 0: Is that what it's doing?

892
00:53:38,371 --> 00:53:40,922
Speaker 1: Yes, so fast that basically so so you can.

893
00:53:40,982 --> 00:53:42,589
Speaker 1: it synchronizes with the screen.

894
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:43,955
Speaker 0: Oh, so there's no.

895
00:53:44,115 --> 00:53:46,304
Speaker 0: so you don't see black see something.

896
00:53:46,344 --> 00:53:46,966
Speaker 0: don't see something.

897
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:47,870
Speaker 0: see something don't see something.

898
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:51,847
Speaker 1: No, it flickers so fast that it like imagine does it make noise while it's flickering like?

899
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:52,449
Speaker 1: I don't know.

900
00:53:52,811 --> 00:53:53,334
Speaker 1: Imagine this.

901
00:53:53,636 --> 00:53:53,938
Speaker 1: imagine.

902
00:53:53,958 --> 00:54:05,250
Speaker 1: you've got a screen to say 120 Hertz Mm-hmm, and the shutter glasses are going in each eye at 120 Hertz offset And then the screen is flipping between the two images that together create the 3d in your eyes.

903
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,377
Speaker 0: Synchronize the glasses with the projector.

904
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,164
Speaker 1: I think there's a way to do that.

905
00:54:09,184 --> 00:54:10,630
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know a lot about the technology.

906
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:11,114
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

907
00:54:11,255 --> 00:54:13,370
Speaker 0: and then you know, I like the ones without the battery.

908
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:17,808
Speaker 1: There are also a lot of multiple demos of different technologies of glasses free 3d.

909
00:54:18,953 --> 00:54:21,727
Speaker 1: Of course the consensus so far has been that it's not that 3d.

910
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:24,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's kind of blurry.

911
00:54:24,497 --> 00:54:31,238
Speaker 0: basically what seems to have happened here right is that Panasonic had a 3d TV Right with an actual release date.

912
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:34,088
Speaker 0: Everyone else is sort of like yeah, we're gonna do 3d.

913
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,430
Speaker 1: Well, because all the technology manufacturers realize that look at Avatar.

914
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,874
Speaker 1: Look how crazy it is in the theaters.

915
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:42,061
Speaker 1: Even if people pirate the movie.

916
00:54:42,422 --> 00:54:49,343
Speaker 1: They want to go into the theater to see the awesome 3d Mmm, once people have 3d TVs that gimmick disappears.

917
00:54:49,664 --> 00:54:51,350
Speaker 0: something else really interesting is that?

918
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:56,185
Speaker 0: Apparently like it doesn't cost that much to add 3d to the TV.

919
00:54:56,285 --> 00:54:57,550
Speaker 0: It's they can just sort of tack it on.

920
00:54:57,674 --> 00:55:06,038
Speaker 0: Yeah So if they can do something like that to sell everyone a new TV that they just sold them HD TVs Big money for them.

921
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:08,170
Speaker 1: I wish this was gonna happen a little bit sooner.

922
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:10,557
Speaker 1: I would wait until the 3d wave starts.

923
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:13,645
Speaker 1: my I'd buy the best 2d TV money could buy.

924
00:55:13,725 --> 00:55:24,048
Speaker 0: a guy at work was looking actually a Projectors and he said that there was a 1080p Projector with 3d abilities that was actually cheaper than a 1080p projector that didn't have 3d.

925
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:29,930
Speaker 1: The only reason I didn't I'm not getting a projector just yet Is that a 52 inch TV is as big as I need in the room.

926
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:32,442
Speaker 1: Anyway a projector would just be overkill.

927
00:55:32,683 --> 00:55:37,950
Speaker 0: also a projector is very annoying You see to put all the equipment in the back and then get the wiring and the pain.

928
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,230
Speaker 1: That would be fine because I wouldn't put anything in the front.

929
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,015
Speaker 1: I don't have a we.

930
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:43,170
Speaker 0: I guess there'd be nothing in the front.

931
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:49,030
Speaker 1: The problems are one the blacks aren't that black and I'm not gonna get that expensive Sony thing with the black screen.

932
00:55:49,331 --> 00:55:50,994
Speaker 0: I don't even know if that's still around anymore.

933
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,240
Speaker 1: There's got to be somewhere or that technology and to the bulbs do burn out.

934
00:55:55,341 --> 00:56:03,277
Speaker 1: So you basically you need to have a projector and a TV and you only use the projector for like movies and the TV for Like playing my video games.

935
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:09,035
Speaker 0: Maybe personally like I'm not you know, I'm only partially excited about 3d.

936
00:56:09,055 --> 00:56:17,854
Speaker 0: It's like yeah It would be pretty cool if I could watch like a hockey in 3d But I'm not gonna pay money for that for a very long time.

937
00:56:17,914 --> 00:56:21,559
Speaker 0: However, however glasses Imagine it's like I gotta buy all these glasses.

938
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:26,615
Speaker 1: I'm playing an FPS that just has natural 3d while you're playing.

939
00:56:26,796 --> 00:56:26,996
Speaker 0: Yeah.

940
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,643
Speaker 0: Yeah be pretty good Wouldn't?

941
00:56:28,683 --> 00:56:36,458
Speaker 1: I wouldn't spend $1,000 on it, but I'm not gonna buy all new monitors Yeah, but what I would do is I would just upgrade when it was time to upgrade and I'd get 3d.

942
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,121
Speaker 1: Yeah,

943
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:56,000
Speaker 0: I foresee, you know, it's like they're being a big 3d push now, but remember the initial HD push right was Like in the late 90s, right and it wasn't until like the late 2000s that eight, you know Everyone's got HD or at least a lot of people have HD and not even the majority have it yet.

944
00:56:56,421 --> 00:57:01,580
Speaker 0: So and no one cares about blu-ray or anything and a lot of people are putting standard def content into their HD TVs.

945
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:07,258
Speaker 0: So I think it'll be probably 10 years before before a lot of people actually have 3d.

946
00:57:08,223 --> 00:57:11,783
Speaker 0: you know as many as have HD now and Before.

947
00:57:11,823 --> 00:57:16,320
Speaker 0: there's like a standard and there's a lot of actual, you know 3d content.

948
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:29,956
Speaker 1: The real drive right now like all the trends are toward digital distribution distribution That is going to take precedence over even high def and I think a lot of people are more interested in getting media easier Than getting high quality media.

949
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:35,680
Speaker 1: Mmm, I mean look how you know people watch entire movies and TV shows on YouTube.

950
00:57:36,282 --> 00:57:38,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, people are willing to put up with really bad quality.

951
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:42,060
Speaker 1: They just want the content and they're not even willing to pay for the content.

952
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:48,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're much more excited about a boxy box than they are about day TV a goat seat projector.

953
00:57:48,878 --> 00:57:58,210
Speaker 1: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
