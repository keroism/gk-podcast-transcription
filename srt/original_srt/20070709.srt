1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,649
Speaker 0: It's Monday July 9th.

2
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:12,792
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:19,160
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight hard-Drive failure.

4
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:25,397
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:36,410
Speaker 0: Well, I gotta say it was a pretty relaxing and generally awesome weekend until the last minute until I went to the emergency room.

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,614
Speaker 1: Yeah That can never be good.

7
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:40,597
Speaker 0: Yeah.

8
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:40,978
Speaker 0: Well.

9
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:41,700
Speaker 0: We had a good weekend.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,462
Speaker 0: We didn't go anywhere.

11
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:44,107
Speaker 0: We just finished challenger on fire.

12
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:49,024
Speaker 0: mostly Mostly we still have something to do and yeah, we're getting ready for con season.

13
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:50,350
Speaker 0: You know that was our last free weekend.

14
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:54,006
Speaker 0: So it's like nine o'clock, and I'm making lamb burgers, and I'm not paying attention.

15
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:58,621
Speaker 0: I'm chopping up some onions I'm chopping them up stupidly and I hit my finger with the knife.

16
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,510
Speaker 1: good job, Mr.. Cut yourself there.

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, quite deeply - yeah.

18
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:12,569
Speaker 1: So of course rim cut himself Huh, and we got to take him the emergency room because otherwise he'll just bleed to death all over the floor.

19
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:20,749
Speaker 0: well I'm standing there looking cuz it's the tip of my pinky finger, so I'm thinking I'm holding it back together And I'm thinking all right is this something I can deal with on my own?

20
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:25,089
Speaker 0: And then I pull it open and I pull off the whole front of my pinky finger.

21
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,181
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, so uh great.

22
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:32,110
Speaker 0: Let's just go to the emergency room.

23
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:37,165
Speaker 1: Well, it's not something where you got to call 911 to get the ambulance.

24
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:38,470
Speaker 1: I mean he cut his finger.

25
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:43,849
Speaker 1: You don't call the ambulance for the cut finger especially since you have to pay the ambulance fee.

26
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:53,110
Speaker 1: well I wouldn't have but yeah, but anyway I'm sure many people would have but we being sane would not have called the ambulance for a cut finger.

27
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:55,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I mean my insurance would have covered it.

28
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,481
Speaker 0: It's more that I hate calling the ambulance unless I really need to exactly.

29
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:02,490
Speaker 1: so we're just gonna drive to the emergency room now.

30
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:05,987
Speaker 1: This is an ambulance that drives by our house crazy fast all the time.

31
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:06,710
Speaker 1: He's pretty awesome.

32
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:16,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've never actually seen his face no, but we hear him drive by and we see him drive But we can tell him apart from the other ambulances cuz he's going about 70 or 80 down our street.

33
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:23,443
Speaker 1: Yep, so We figured there's a hospital right next to our house And we figured that's where he was going to and coming from.

34
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:28,724
Speaker 1: so we go over there And it is a hospital, but it's only a rehab kind of hospital.

35
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:30,170
Speaker 0: It was like Dominion tank police.

36
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:32,600
Speaker 0: We only treat healthy people here right.

37
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,488
Speaker 1: so they didn't have an emergency room there.

38
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,390
Speaker 0: luckily We ran into some guy on rehab who told us where some other emergency.

39
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,450
Speaker 1: They were all like walking around in a circle around the hospital.

40
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,678
Speaker 1: So we just drove through the mass of people.

41
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:50,768
Speaker 0: it was kind of scary when Scott pulls up to these people and they kind of Swarm around the car when he opens his window, and they all start talking at once.

42
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:53,301
Speaker 1: yeah But they told me how to get to the emergency room.

43
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:55,933
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we went and One.

44
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:59,390
Speaker 0: the nearest emergency room to our house is quite a ways away.

45
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,399
Speaker 1: It's on the other side of the Hudson River.

46
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:04,070
Speaker 0: the only other option is to drive all the way up to Poughkeepsie.

47
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:09,270
Speaker 1: I'm thinking maybe they should set up places that are just emergency rooms and not a whole hospital.

48
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:15,769
Speaker 0: The only reason they don't I think is that emergency rooms are the least profitable and most pain-in-the-ass part of any hospital.

49
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:19,019
Speaker 0: as it Is no one would willingly run one in and of itself.

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,784
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, of course.

51
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:22,028
Speaker 1: It's the most necessary part.

52
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:24,175
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I was a certain part.

53
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:29,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe that's the ticket is did not have socialized medicine, but just have socialized emergency rooms.

54
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe that's make them all over the place.

55
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:40,845
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be opposed to that at all if it were a system where if they only treated Sudden illness I mean it's already sort of socialized and that they're forced to serve people right.

56
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:43,694
Speaker 1: so now we could have private hospitals for all the.

57
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:52,097
Speaker 1: you know the long term the cancer treatments and things you know that actually cost a lot of money and Those places can actually be profitable.

58
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:56,430
Speaker 1: and the unprofitable part that we really need badly the emergency room.

59
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,989
Speaker 1: We could just make it happen and all every city.

60
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:05,210
Speaker 1: Anyway anyway, so so we find out where the emergency room is and it wasn't so easy to get there.

61
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,316
Speaker 1: We made one wrong turn.

62
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:08,910
Speaker 1: we had to turn around on this road on that cursed road.

63
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:17,910
Speaker 0: Yep, see well before we often would try to drive over to Newburgh thinking All right, everyone says there's great restaurants over here and we're sick of eating at restaurants on this side of the river.

64
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,644
Speaker 0: let's go eat somewhere.

65
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:29,477
Speaker 0: and Every time we got over there we end up going down this one road Technically up this one road and as far as I can tell there is nothing on that road Anywhere.

66
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:39,230
Speaker 0: if you go down that road There is never going to be a single useful place of business Until you get to new Paul's like an hour away in which case you will just find many alcoholic places of businesses.

67
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,129
Speaker 1: Yes places of businesses.

68
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:48,775
Speaker 1: So we turned around the other direction on that road and we found the hospital because we followed an ambulance there And I was.

69
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:54,558
Speaker 1: you know of course I know that waiting in emergency rooms Especially if you're not dying takes a long time now.

70
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,370
Speaker 0: I also know this partly because I work in hospitals every day.

71
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,910
Speaker 1: Yep, so my plan was drop that rim off and go home and then rim would call me when he wanted to come back.

72
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:12,717
Speaker 1: So I drop him off and then I start leaving and then Emily calls me and she's like, oh they took rim right in And he's like really now they did.

73
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:18,079
Speaker 0: they took me right away because I was bleeding and they said all right go right in there We're gonna triage you the triage me.

74
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:19,245
Speaker 0: then she left.

75
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,090
Speaker 0: another person came in.

76
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,210
Speaker 0: They took all my insurance information.

77
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:22,254
Speaker 0: someone else came in.

78
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:33,274
Speaker 0: a third nurse came in asked me a bunch of questions that did a few more tests to make sure I Wasn't dying or anything asked me a couple questions about my wound and then they said and I quote a doctor will be right with you It won't be long.

79
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:38,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, so because they took rim right in usually when you're waiting at the emergency room.

80
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:42,050
Speaker 1: You're waiting in the waiting room and it takes forever before they let you inside.

81
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:51,427
Speaker 1: But once you're inside usually within like unless you know a crazy dying person comes in You're only gonna be waiting inside for at most 15 20 minutes before someone does something to you.

82
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:55,578
Speaker 0: thus it Begins, so I'm sitting there reading my book thinking.

83
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:59,270
Speaker 0: All right any minute now any minute now any minute now any minute now.

84
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:06,258
Speaker 1: No one has walked by in the hallways dark With Emily and there was not so many other people there.

85
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:11,635
Speaker 1: and eventually like the receptionist went home and see I'm sitting there thinking I should just go back home.

86
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:12,801
Speaker 1: It's gonna take longer.

87
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:13,203
Speaker 1: right?

88
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:16,376
Speaker 1: you bought into the sunk cost Didn't buy into the sunk cost fallacy?

89
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:19,105
Speaker 1: I had another made possible fallacy that I was falling to.

90
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:20,510
Speaker 1: I knew the sunk cost fallacy.

91
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,116
Speaker 1: You know the sunk cost fallacy is.

92
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:23,581
Speaker 1: I already waited an hour.

93
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:28,089
Speaker 1: if I you know by going home I'm basically route losing that hour.

94
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:29,494
Speaker 1: That's wrong.

95
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:31,485
Speaker 1: That's that's bullshit because every minute.

96
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:34,381
Speaker 1: I stay is another middle I lose even though I already lost that hour.

97
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:35,749
Speaker 1: I can't get it back right.

98
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:39,544
Speaker 1: But the fallacy if may might have been a fallacy that I was falling to.

99
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:40,970
Speaker 1: was that okay?

100
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:42,836
Speaker 1: Every minute that goes by.

101
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:47,009
Speaker 1: the odds of rim appearing you know doctored up increase.

102
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:54,009
Speaker 1: I Really don't want to risk having to go home and then turn around while I'm on the way home.

103
00:06:54,474 --> 00:07:07,988
Speaker 1: That's losing more time yep, so it was basically I was assessing the risk of losing even more time in the future by going home as Because the end that risk of losing even more time increased as time progressed.

104
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:20,350
Speaker 0: meanwhile I'm sitting there making my own calculations in a separate room and because I have a real injury and there is a time limit Where good treatment can be applied that they can just ignore me like they normally do to people in emergency rooms.

105
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:24,977
Speaker 0: I could go on and on about the techniques They use to ignore you in the emergency room.

106
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:32,562
Speaker 0: my primary advice to you is unless you are dying or suffered a severe injury Don't go to an emergency room wait till the next day and go to a clinic.

107
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:37,080
Speaker 1: yep, but basically Waited there for many many hours.

108
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:55,679
Speaker 0: so after the first hour They come and get me and they say all right we're gonna move you to this room and they wouldn't really say why is they move you to another place and another hour goes by and Emily comes in and She was the kind of snuck in through the locked door when someone else walked in and there's really no one around and she basically Says yeah, apparently they lost you.

109
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:05,253
Speaker 0: you see they didn't tell me But the reason I waited in that room for an hour was that they forgot I was there and they tried to not let me know that they had forgotten I was there.

110
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:07,869
Speaker 0: so they moved me somewhere else and made something up.

111
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:18,847
Speaker 0: So then they say all right someone will be with you shortly because you're bleeding all right we wait and wait wait and wait and wait and wait and wait.

112
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:27,470
Speaker 0: and eventually I Look at my finger And I'm talking Emily and she our sister knows a lot about this and we're pretty much starting to feel like it's gonna be too.

113
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:30,325
Speaker 0: Anyway at which point there's no reason to be at the doctor?

114
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:31,009
Speaker 0: they're not gonna help me.

115
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,689
Speaker 1: Yeah.

116
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:39,130
Speaker 0: so eventually I get up and I kind of walk out into the main area outside of the Emergency rooms and the nurses are all kind of walking around.

117
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,250
Speaker 0: There's like 12 of them and they're all pointedly avoiding eye contact at all costs.

118
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,330
Speaker 0: So eventually I kind of stare at one.

119
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:57,030
Speaker 0: I just pick one this guy who's sitting there and I stare at him not moving and he knows I'm there because he glances up Once and eventually he realizes I'm not gonna stop staring at him.

120
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:59,119
Speaker 0: So he looks up and he asked very pleasantly.

121
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:00,043
Speaker 0: Can I help you?

122
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:12,070
Speaker 0: and I basically said If there's no chance of me getting treated anytime soon Can I just get like a butterfly bandage or something to put on myself and just leave and then all the other nurses come over?

123
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:16,910
Speaker 0: And they basically said no They basically were elated.

124
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,988
Speaker 0: Yeah You can leave if you want.

125
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:23,890
Speaker 0: But they balked at giving me the one thing I wanted a butterfly bandage to kind of suture the thing myself.

126
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:28,100
Speaker 0: uh Eventually, I convinced them to give me a band-aid.

127
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:29,787
Speaker 0: so I wouldn't believe we have band-aids.

128
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:30,630
Speaker 1: We don't need their band.

129
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,975
Speaker 0: I didn't want to bleed on your car.

130
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:37,871
Speaker 0: So they would be grudgingly give me this one band-aid and then they tell me to get out Huh?

131
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:42,326
Speaker 0: So I left and I come out and I explained to Scott that no I didn't get treated.

132
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:43,290
Speaker 0: fuck this hospital.

133
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:48,227
Speaker 1: See people complain about the health care system and they say oh, it should be private.

134
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,950
Speaker 1: Oh, it should be public.

135
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:52,070
Speaker 1: They say be this it should be that you know what is with socialized medicine.

136
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,297
Speaker 0: You have to wait in lines to get medical treatment.

137
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:58,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what the problem really is is the hospital is incompetent.

138
00:09:58,571 --> 00:10:01,370
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if we pay the hospital with money out of your wallet.

139
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:03,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't matter if we pay the hospital with tax money.

140
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:07,482
Speaker 1: The problem is the hospital sucks ass either way.

141
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,750
Speaker 0: that and not to sound conceited or anything.

142
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,790
Speaker 0: But the way the world is I have super good health insurance and I'm relatively wealthy.

143
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:16,421
Speaker 1: The insurance would have just paid it.

144
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:17,870
Speaker 1: there wasn't a problem with the insurance.

145
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:24,570
Speaker 1: Even if Rym was Bill Gates and he had a billion dollars going to this hospital it would have been treated like shit.

146
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,354
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

147
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:28,650
Speaker 0: if I was Bill Gates, I would have known better and I would have flown to my personal doctor.

148
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:29,350
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

149
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:42,230
Speaker 1: But you know no matter how rich Rym could have been like an executive from New York City or something who would like five million Dollars but is not famous or well-known and just walked into this hospital and he would have been treated exactly the same way.

150
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:49,570
Speaker 0: It's total ass but it's kind of fair in a sick way everybody treated in the same shitty level of service.

151
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:54,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I can understand the fact that you know, okay if someone else comes in with something more serious.

152
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:55,510
Speaker 1: you treat them first.

153
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:56,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's possible.

154
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,529
Speaker 1: You have a run of bad luck.

155
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:02,069
Speaker 1: You just happen to cut your finger when ten people have heart attacks and that that's fine.

156
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:02,410
Speaker 0: You got it.

157
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,902
Speaker 1: I mean, that's that's that's acceptable the prod.

158
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:10,448
Speaker 1: the main problem I have here Right is that I was watching and only like three ambulances showed up.

159
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,420
Speaker 1: You're telling me there's less than three doctors.

160
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:14,705
Speaker 0: There was one doctor.

161
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:16,010
Speaker 0: you realize very one doctor.

162
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,330
Speaker 1: So three people came in in ambulances and only one of them got treated and two of them were suffering.

163
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:30,577
Speaker 0: There is insufficient number of doctors there but the problem is there's no money to pay for more doctors and you can't predict the odds of people coming into the Emergency room at night and all that business.

164
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,590
Speaker 0: what it really came down to was that they didn't care.

165
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:38,126
Speaker 0: They didn't really triage me properly because they no one actually looked at my wound.

166
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:45,330
Speaker 0: if they had looked at my wound They would have realized wow that just needs two stitches and maybe some antibiotics and a tetanus shot and he can go home.

167
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they waited so long and I didn't know much about this.

168
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:55,945
Speaker 0: but now I know that according to the real doctor I went to today if You wait too long to get stitches like more than a few hours.

169
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:58,426
Speaker 0: It's too late now You can't get stitches and now you're fucked.

170
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:11,170
Speaker 0: In fact the new the doc the real doctor I went to today told me that if I wanted to I could probably sue the Emergency room for failing to properly triage me and denying me the treatment that would have led to a better prognosis.

171
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,948
Speaker 1: You should at least ask one of your free lawyers about it.

172
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:17,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really want to sue because that I'll be okay.

173
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:19,210
Speaker 1: I need to make a stink at the very least.

174
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,270
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm gonna make a little bit of a stink but my real gripe is with that specific hospital.

175
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:24,757
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean they were not.

176
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:29,096
Speaker 1: it isn't anecdotal evidence here, but dad Anecdotal evidence you speak of.

177
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:32,848
Speaker 0: yes, so I skipped work today because I was still bleeding in the morning.

178
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,380
Speaker 0: Wow So just oozing it wasn't like super bleeding, but it was still bleeding.

179
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:39,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I go to just a normal walk-in clinic.

180
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,881
Speaker 0: It's actually a clinic designed more for poor people.

181
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:42,062
Speaker 0: Yeah.

182
00:12:42,082 --> 00:12:42,785
Speaker 1: It's this place called.

183
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:43,950
Speaker 1: There's a couple of them around here.

184
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:50,350
Speaker 1: It's called medicus, and it's just a place that you walk into and they have normal physicians and nurses there.

185
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,098
Speaker 0: It's like a daytime emergency room.

186
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:52,901
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can go get.

187
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:53,946
Speaker 1: it's not like an emergency.

188
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:55,750
Speaker 1: if you have an emergency They can't really help you.

189
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:01,494
Speaker 1: But you know if you have a cold or you need a prescription for a cream I got a rash.

190
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:04,105
Speaker 1: you know anything normal, and you don't you know.

191
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:04,969
Speaker 1: you could just go there.

192
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:07,850
Speaker 0: I think that the thing is these serve the vital purpose.

193
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:15,490
Speaker 0: They're kind of the mid-range because what I had was not a life-threatening emergency Yeah, but it was a situation that the proper thing to do was to go to a doctor.

194
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, and prompt treatment, but the problem is a much better kind of place is not open 24/7 the fraud.

195
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:27,509
Speaker 0: The fact is the only place open 24/7 was the shitty emergency room and by the time you waited until morning It was too late.

196
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:33,075
Speaker 0: I do want to point out that way back like a year and a half ago I had the long.

197
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:41,224
Speaker 0: story short is one of my teeth had this weird cavity underneath that no dentist had noticed and One day the whole front of the tooth just popped off while I was brushing my teeth.

198
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,338
Speaker 0: well in the middle of the night I was home alone to which I go.

199
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:45,644
Speaker 0: Oh fuck.

200
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:46,849
Speaker 0: What do I do ah?

201
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,673
Speaker 1: Call the dentist.

202
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:52,934
Speaker 0: so I called my dentist and that no one was there obviously But there was.

203
00:13:52,954 --> 00:14:01,550
Speaker 0: they said in an emergency call this number And I called this other number and they told me to come and they paged the dentist and he came and fixed me that night.

204
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:03,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was an emergency.

205
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:06,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that wasn't even as serious as the cut on your finger.

206
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:11,468
Speaker 1: I'm not at all Yeah, and they got a doctor or a dentist up in the middle of the night to come.

207
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,194
Speaker 0: granted It was a private practice.

208
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:17,390
Speaker 0: the dentist did it willingly because I guess he cares and because he made some money off of it.

209
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:20,484
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean rims insurance was gonna pay this hospital money.

210
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:24,090
Speaker 1: if the hospital is losing money Don't you think they want to take rim in first?

211
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,298
Speaker 1: I mean sure it's kind of I wouldn't.

212
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,770
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say that they should treat someone with insurance.

213
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:33,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz they got a monster syndrome where you got to treat the famous politician exactly.

214
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,530
Speaker 1: You don't want it to be like monster.

215
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:43,369
Speaker 1: You do not want to do that because then you know the person who's seriously dying will die while Bill Gates gets his like scrape You know bandaged up.

216
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:49,270
Speaker 1: You don't want that to happen, but at the same time if the hospital would have had the one more doctor.

217
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:50,775
Speaker 1: You know, they're not proud.

218
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:53,905
Speaker 1: they're thinking they're losing money with the one doctor they have there.

219
00:14:54,326 --> 00:15:00,190
Speaker 1: but with the two doctors They'd be able to treat some of these other people and maybe get some insurance money out of them.

220
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:05,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is the vast majority of people who come to any emergency room don't have insurance.

221
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:06,556
Speaker 1: I know that's.

222
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:12,050
Speaker 1: the other thing is they need to find That the law is if someone comes to emergency room, they kind of have to treat them.

223
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:14,640
Speaker 1: They really need to make it some way.

224
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,603
Speaker 1: where you can be triaged out the door, you know I mean rim should have been triaged to stitches.

225
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:20,830
Speaker 1: There is no doubt about all I need.

226
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:28,686
Speaker 1: It was two stitches, but the problem is people who come in with a cold They they eventually get in and people with a stomachache.

227
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:31,413
Speaker 1: That's not appendicitis Eventually get in.

228
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:37,810
Speaker 1: they need to be able and allowed to just send those people home and they'd be allowed to save a lot of Money, it's a complicated problem.

229
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,469
Speaker 0: We should probably do a show about this because I have some in sounds like you already did the show about this.

230
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:44,522
Speaker 0: Well having worked in hospitals for a while now.

231
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:46,390
Speaker 0: I've learned a lot about how this works.

232
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:50,654
Speaker 1: You should definitely like make a stink like to the local media or something I'm thinking about it.

233
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:54,009
Speaker 1: make the hospital have a bad name because I think that's the only way we can hurt them without.

234
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:58,576
Speaker 0: well So I'm at this doctor today and they say yeah It's too late to get stitches.

235
00:15:58,737 --> 00:16:04,400
Speaker 0: and when I tell him the story of what happened They basically stop and say what hospital was it?

236
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:05,985
Speaker 0: and I tell him st.

237
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:06,326
Speaker 0: Luke's.

238
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:07,589
Speaker 0: I went to st.

239
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:13,872
Speaker 0: Luke's It's the only emergency room and the nurse says oh Well, let me tell you something about st Luke's.

240
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:23,316
Speaker 0: and she spewed forth the anecdotes of all the problems they have had with st Luke's and how she personally had had a problem at st Luke's once in the emergency room.

241
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:28,230
Speaker 0: and now someone basically like almost broke his pelvis and they wouldn't really do anything.

242
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:29,502
Speaker 0: What the hell?

243
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:33,708
Speaker 1: Yeah How could a place like this be in operations like dr.

244
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:33,909
Speaker 1: Nix?

245
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:43,410
Speaker 0: Well, I've been to some emergency room like remember way back when I had Lyme disease Way back years and years ago I caught Lyme disease and I didn't know what it was right away.

246
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:46,198
Speaker 0: So I go to the hospital in the emergency room and I'm like.

247
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:55,111
Speaker 0: I got 103 fever and a headache and it's persisted for a Day, I think I'm sick and they ran some tests and they made me sit there for like four hours At least.

248
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:55,935
Speaker 1: they ran tests.

249
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:57,282
Speaker 0: Yeah useless tests.

250
00:16:57,664 --> 00:16:58,950
Speaker 0: Oh the test didn't show anything.

251
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,370
Speaker 0: They showed me being in perfect health and then they sent me home with a bottle of aspirin.

252
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:06,284
Speaker 0: Wow, so the next day I went to a different doctor who said you have Lyme disease.

253
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:07,508
Speaker 0: Here's some antibiotics.

254
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,990
Speaker 0: go home.

255
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:14,890
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe it's just that they shove the shitty doctors in the emergency room, but I went to another emergency room.

256
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:16,162
Speaker 0: It was just a different hospital.

257
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,675
Speaker 0: Oh, oh Maybe I was just lucky.

258
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:23,230
Speaker 0: I went into the other one and the nurse is like wait a minute Let me see your arms and she looks at one arm one time.

259
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,001
Speaker 0: So let me see your knees and I pull up one.

260
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,771
Speaker 0: She's like, aha There it is.

261
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,755
Speaker 0: You've got Lyme disease.

262
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:29,518
Speaker 0: Whoa.

263
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:29,939
Speaker 0: Okay.

264
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:30,922
Speaker 0: What do I do?

265
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:31,865
Speaker 0: Take these pills?

266
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:32,527
Speaker 1: Yeah.

267
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,570
Speaker 1: Oh, well So tech type news.

268
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:44,623
Speaker 0: Yeah, the moral is my fingers hurt and I got to hold it up and it sucks, but I didn't die yet Yep, and I got a tetanus shot, which I was kind of due for.

269
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:46,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, too bad you didn't get tetanus.

270
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, tetanus is double awesome.

271
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:48,919
Speaker 0: It is.

272
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:50,705
Speaker 0: I remember back when I had tetanus.

273
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:51,488
Speaker 0: That was a riot.

274
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:59,370
Speaker 1: Yep All right, so everyone's probably seen this story and the headline is NASA buys 19 million dollar toilet.

275
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:06,139
Speaker 1: Wait a minute NASA or NASA NASA the regular NASA, okay Right and everyone's like OMG.

276
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,303
Speaker 1: Our government is crazy.

277
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:09,610
Speaker 1: They waste money on bullshit blabbity blabbity blah.

278
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:18,630
Speaker 0: It's kind of like that apocryphal story about You know NASA spent millions and millions developing a pen that would work in space and the Russians just used a pencil, right?

279
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,708
Speaker 1: So basically this is not stupid like you think it is.

280
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:25,660
Speaker 1: The space station needs a toilet.

281
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:26,824
Speaker 1: people need to go to the bath.

282
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:27,627
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

283
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:28,229
Speaker 0: People don't pee.

284
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:30,443
Speaker 1: Alright, no one guys.

285
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:31,110
Speaker 1: I forgot.

286
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:35,382
Speaker 1: And it has a toilet but the toilet has some problems.

287
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:42,301
Speaker 1: you see it doesn't really have a way to Like hold you down while you're pooping.

288
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:44,110
Speaker 0: well, you can kind of strap yourself down.

289
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,116
Speaker 1: Well, no there weren't.

290
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:47,450
Speaker 1: the current toilet doesn't have any straps or anything.

291
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,908
Speaker 1: Wow, you have to sort of push yourself towards the toilet with your arms or something.

292
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:56,050
Speaker 1: man The one imagine if like you just floated upwards and your poop kind of came out.

293
00:18:56,653 --> 00:19:04,830
Speaker 1: Even worse the poop would act as a propulsive force Yes, and also what could you push against to squeeze the poop out of you?

294
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,917
Speaker 1: You need to push you against something.

295
00:19:07,158 --> 00:19:09,970
Speaker 1: You can't just push against yourself to make the poop come out.

296
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,016
Speaker 0: Well, the poop will just come out.

297
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:12,565
Speaker 0: you realize it'll be like a jet though.

298
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,254
Speaker 0: It'll rocket you far I know and the poop?

299
00:19:14,294 --> 00:19:15,338
Speaker 0: who knows what I'll happen to you.

300
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:24,707
Speaker 0: I do point out though that the space shuttle has straps Yes, but anyway, why didn't they just put some straps on on the Russian side of the space station?

301
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:25,670
Speaker 1: There's a toilet, right?

302
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:26,798
Speaker 1: That's all not.

303
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:32,586
Speaker 1: it's basically almost the same as the toilet The Americans have only it has straps and it has separate hoses for everyone to pee in.

304
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,430
Speaker 1: so everyone has their own.

305
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:35,483
Speaker 0: You know, that's kind of nice.

306
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:38,704
Speaker 0: Yeah But everyone shares the same pooper, right?

307
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:45,190
Speaker 1: Yes It's just and the US side had this toilet that was older and inferior.

308
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:48,043
Speaker 0: So what were the US astronauts sneaking over to the Russian side?

309
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:52,321
Speaker 1: Maybe I have no idea But basically NASA had two choices at this point.

310
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:54,390
Speaker 1: They're sending more people up to the space station.

311
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,310
Speaker 1: There's gonna be six people up there instead of three.

312
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:01,649
Speaker 1: So they need more privacy more pooping more peeing right and the current toilet wasn't gonna cut it.

313
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,007
Speaker 1: So what are they gonna do?

314
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:14,370
Speaker 1: They can either invent and develop their own toilet or they can just pay 19 million dollars to the Russians to get the Russian toilet on their side and that's what they did.

315
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:16,510
Speaker 0: It could hold it in and it's not stupid.

316
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,655
Speaker 1: It wasn't a waste of money.

317
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:36,179
Speaker 1: if you if you agree that the space station at all is a good idea Which is not something I want to discuss right now Then you must agree that buying this toilet was the good idea because it's either 19 million dollars to the toilet a lot more money for a new toilet that can invent one or The shitty old toilet which doesn't cut it.

318
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,566
Speaker 1: Well, it's your three choices.

319
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:42,827
Speaker 0: people always say Yeah, we went to the moon in the 60s and now we got this crap.

320
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:43,510
Speaker 0: What's going on?

321
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,654
Speaker 0: How come we're so much worse now?

322
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:45,778
Speaker 0: Why can't we go back to the moon?

323
00:20:46,199 --> 00:21:02,689
Speaker 0: and people seem to forget the sheer amount of Economic and Mental power and and just the it took so much to get to the moon and to do the things we did back then That the nation really isn't prepared to put that some that amount of effort toward anything right now.

324
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:15,190
Speaker 1: Yep, especially when we've got plus think about it every guy going on every American right that they spend researching how to make a better Space toilet is not researching how to keep this rocket from exploding.

325
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:19,060
Speaker 1: Same guys, they're all NASA scientists researching.

326
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,082
Speaker 1: They all do the same shit.

327
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:21,145
Speaker 0: Not that NASA.

328
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:23,170
Speaker 0: I have mixed feelings about NASA.

329
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,350
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say they're the greatest organization in the world.

330
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:28,429
Speaker 1: They're very government bureaucratic inefficient, etc.

331
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:34,290
Speaker 0: But at the same time I'm not going to pretend that they're the worst organization of the world because they've accomplished a lot.

332
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:35,798
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not recently.

333
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,110
Speaker 0: think about the enormity of what they did.

334
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:44,250
Speaker 0: They sent human beings to the moon and back and it worked multiple times.

335
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:46,790
Speaker 1: Yes, so that's crazy.

336
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:56,868
Speaker 1: Anyone who reads this headline and is like a brabble rabble rabble You're an idiot unless you unless you want to argue about you know The space station being a stupid idea in which case I don't know if I agree with you.

337
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:59,908
Speaker 0: We'll see All right, one more thing 19 million, right?

338
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:06,230
Speaker 0: Yep So 19 million for a thing that's gonna make the space station much better and last a long time and generally make poopin nicer.

339
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:08,306
Speaker 0: I'm all for anything that makes poopin nicer.

340
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,197
Speaker 0: Yep I'm not.

341
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:11,230
Speaker 0: this is a rhetorical question.

342
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,959
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna expect you to answer it, but I ask you all of you out there.

343
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:19,190
Speaker 0: How much does one cruise missile cost?

344
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,894
Speaker 1: They're like Ted.

345
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:22,178
Speaker 1: how much aren't they like?

346
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:22,941
Speaker 1: a million dollars each?

347
00:22:23,202 --> 00:22:25,450
Speaker 0: How much are we spot us the United States spending in?

348
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,515
Speaker 0: Iraq, I don't know.

349
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:30,490
Speaker 1: see for the same people who would say this is dumb would also say Iraq is dumb.

350
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,578
Speaker 1: They say we shouldn't be spending money in either of those things.

351
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:35,047
Speaker 0: So yeah, we shouldn't be spending money on anything.

352
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:35,790
Speaker 0: That's their problem.

353
00:22:35,992 --> 00:22:37,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I sort of agree.

354
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:41,549
Speaker 1: Emergency rooms in every city fuck yes.

355
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:49,730
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I'm sure you were all familiar with captures completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart.

356
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:59,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically, you know when you sign up for a website and it says type in the letters that you see in this picture The point of that is that only a person can look at the picture.

357
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:06,429
Speaker 1: point Is that yes beautiful a person only a human being can look at that picture and figure out what the letters are.

358
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:13,066
Speaker 1: well computer a Computer can technically do it, but it's very difficult and depending on the image.

359
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,310
Speaker 1: It's even more difficult.

360
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:22,134
Speaker 1: So, you know it even if someone was spamming and even if they had software they could figure out what the words in the picture Are and type them in.

361
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:26,889
Speaker 1: it would be so computationally intensive that they'd need a supercomputer to do it with any speed.

362
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,499
Speaker 1: Stop spam it slows it down significantly.

363
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,604
Speaker 0: See now while that's true.

364
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:32,708
Speaker 0: There are a lot of this theory.

365
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:45,870
Speaker 0: There's been a lot of arms race action going on here because on one Captures were developed but at the same time OCR got better Yeah, and you could make computers that could figure these things out pretty easy.

366
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,416
Speaker 1: So they got to make trickier captures.

367
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:48,822
Speaker 1: that then I hate it.

368
00:23:48,842 --> 00:23:51,492
Speaker 1: when you see a capture that I can't even tell if it's like I see.

369
00:23:51,833 --> 00:24:03,688
Speaker 1: or is it a you that got turned sideways because it got bent and then I typed it in wrong and then I Got to type it again even worse blind bag that the capture solving itself is not the real issue the spammers had to solve.

370
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:10,289
Speaker 0: because I'm not gonna get it all the theory or details about this, but there is something called side channel information.

371
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:22,410
Speaker 0: or basically, if you're trying to hide information from someone you have to be aware of the fact that Information gets out through other channels that you that you might not anticipate.

372
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:26,650
Speaker 0: Like say I'm trying to keep Scott from reading one of the books in my room.

373
00:24:27,112 --> 00:24:29,099
Speaker 0: Alright, so I duct tape that book shut.

374
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:33,823
Speaker 0: now Scott sees that one of the books has duct tape on it and wonders Why I duct tape that book shot.

375
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:39,425
Speaker 0: Yeah or Say you're trying to hide the fact that you go to a certain website.

376
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:40,610
Speaker 0: So you encrypt all your traffic.

377
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:47,258
Speaker 0: Oh, but you can look at logs on routers and see that your IP address was talking to that IP address even if you can't know what the data was.

378
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:48,445
Speaker 0: things like that.

379
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:59,730
Speaker 0: and The deal is really that with captchas you could figure them out through means that had nothing to do with the capture itself like Maybe there's only a limited number of answers and you can brute-force it.

380
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,750
Speaker 1: You have some people actually have the full-on super captures which are random and they make images on the fly.

381
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:07,290
Speaker 1: But a lot of people just have like three or four.

382
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:11,216
Speaker 1: They have the same one over and over or something like that And even the ones that generate on the fly.

383
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:16,018
Speaker 0: a lot of people have done them stupidly like the alt text will be the thing That's supposed to be there.

384
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:17,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, good job.

385
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,427
Speaker 0: It just shows a picture and you can just correlate the file name to one of the known captchas.

386
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:22,965
Speaker 1: solved good Good job again.

387
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:38,249
Speaker 0: Also, you can very easily Just make a fake porn site and trick people who want to see your porn into solving captchas for you and then saving the responses Regardless of how they've done it.

388
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:51,270
Speaker 0: However, someone has broken apparently the captchas used for Yahoo and hotmail email and as a result Lots and lots of Yahoo and hotmail email accounts are suddenly being made and spamming the living fuck out of people.

389
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,232
Speaker 1: Well, I actually read this actually reminds me of something I saw recently.

390
00:25:55,293 --> 00:26:01,310
Speaker 1: that is a really clever way of stopping spammers without captchas which also by the way inhibit blind people.

391
00:26:02,452 --> 00:26:12,251
Speaker 1: What you do is you make a form right and when you make a form on a web page I don't want to get into this so deeply you make fields and there are different kinds of fields You can make.

392
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:18,231
Speaker 1: you can make text fields radio button fields checkbox fields, you know, pull down fields all that sort of stuff right.

393
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:28,428
Speaker 1: one kind of field you can make is a hidden field and a hidden field has some information in it and But the person filling out the form doesn't see it.

394
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:36,340
Speaker 1: But when you click the submit button that information gets submitted and it's very useful for programmers and people who fill out forms Don't really need to know about it.

395
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:40,038
Speaker 1: Well The thing is a lot of spammers.

396
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:46,690
Speaker 1: the way their software works is it looks at the form Not from the perspective of someone sitting and looking at the web browser.

397
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:50,149
Speaker 1: It just looks at all the fields in the HTML and fills them out.

398
00:26:50,672 --> 00:26:53,528
Speaker 1: It also sees that when there's a hidden field, it doesn't fill it out.

399
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:57,145
Speaker 1: what if you took a non hidden field like a text field?

400
00:26:57,205 --> 00:27:03,585
Speaker 1: right, but you Made it so the user can't see it with some CSS or even like.

401
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:04,730
Speaker 0: they make it so they can see it.

402
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:07,396
Speaker 0: But the text above it says don't write anything here Yep.

403
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:16,834
Speaker 1: And then a spam bot will automatically like if you call the field address the spam Bob will automatically fill that in Pretty much every time.

404
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:25,829
Speaker 1: and now whenever you get someone submitting the form with the address field filled in You know that a human being didn't fill it in, you know that a spammer filled it in.

405
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:27,196
Speaker 1: So you just ignore that.

406
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:29,690
Speaker 1: one or an idiot or an idiot, you know.

407
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,209
Speaker 1: But if you make the fee the form field disappear with CSS so that people can't see it.

408
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:38,209
Speaker 1: You know, the only way that was filled in was by a spammer.

409
00:27:38,803 --> 00:27:43,850
Speaker 0: Of course They could just escalate the arms race and look at the CSS to figure out if something's visible or not.

410
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,381
Speaker 1: They could they could but there are tricky ways of hiding the CSS from them inside.

411
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:47,863
Speaker 1: True there are.

412
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:49,147
Speaker 1: With JavaScripts and things.

413
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:53,441
Speaker 0: The reason I brought this News up is that there is a fundamental problem here.

414
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:57,840
Speaker 0: That is well below this issue yet It is the real problem.

415
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:03,941
Speaker 0: I also want to point out that Google Gmail spam filtering works up almost a hundred percent.

416
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:07,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, I understand why people still have a problem with spammers.

417
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:09,710
Speaker 0: I mean we get a spam a second to the geek nights account.

418
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:17,605
Speaker 1: I mean if I was if I was someone like Google running email servers I would want to stop spam because that saves me money and bandwidth and such and storage.

419
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:20,374
Speaker 1: but as a user I have a spam filter.

420
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:20,995
Speaker 1: It works.

421
00:28:21,477 --> 00:28:23,362
Speaker 1: It works 99% of the time.

422
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:24,626
Speaker 1: What's my problem?

423
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,110
Speaker 1: I don't really give a shit about spam.

424
00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:41,090
Speaker 0: Well, the other thing is I tend to and I know some people disagree but when it comes to blocking undesirable content I've realized that there's so much content on the internet that I'm willing to miss something for the benefit of not having to deal with the crap.

425
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:49,050
Speaker 0: I'll block things with a wide brush if One out of a thousand emails that comes to me or even one out of a hundred that I might have wanted gets blocked accidentally.

426
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,496
Speaker 0: That's worth it.

427
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:52,189
Speaker 0: I'm willing to not get that email.

428
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:53,852
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right,

429
00:28:54,233 --> 00:29:14,770
Speaker 0: but the real issue here the real real problem the only reason this happens is because of the Windows machines that are compromised by Trojans and spyware and Because the only way this works is if you hit Yahoo or Hotmail or whoever from a million different IP addresses.

430
00:29:15,312 --> 00:29:20,950
Speaker 0: That way sure they figure out someone's a spammer and they block the IP address, but there's a million more people spamming.

431
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:28,250
Speaker 0: you can't tell who's a spammer and who isn't because pretty much a good portion of the Windows machines on the internet are compromised.

432
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,756
Speaker 0: Do it based on IP address?

433
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:41,090
Speaker 0: if you knew at least 99% or even 90% That IP addresses could generally be trusted then it'd be really trivial to blacklist bad IP addresses.

434
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:43,168
Speaker 1: You know, what do we do when we go to IP v6 then?

435
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,215
Speaker 0: IP v6 is a whole different piece.

436
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:45,697
Speaker 0: I'm not.

437
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:46,922
Speaker 1: I know it's what I'm saying though.

438
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:53,236
Speaker 1: if we want to go that way then IP address blocking doesn't work But I do agree I could compromise.

439
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:59,550
Speaker 1: Windows machines are the core of all the other problems and if we fix that one Everything will be good.

440
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:07,705
Speaker 1: Actually if everyone switched to Vista which so far is proved to be fairly secure even though annoying We a lot of this shit would go away.

441
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:09,874
Speaker 0: Yeah So think of this.

442
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:18,682
Speaker 0: spam is not caused by anything other than people Maybe like you who have a Windows computer and don't keep it secure.

443
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:24,403
Speaker 0: and if you think that this is a far-flung threat I dare you to install a program called wire shark.

444
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:28,781
Speaker 0: run it for an hour and See if anything interesting is in those logs.

445
00:30:29,223 --> 00:30:30,810
Speaker 1: I don't know how many people you able to read those.

446
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:34,681
Speaker 0: well I installed a Windows before I wiped it out and install the new windows.

447
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:48,808
Speaker 0: when I built the new computer and I installed a bunch of Wares partly as a test and with one exception every single piece of wares I installed Had a horrible spyware and horrible spam bots built into it.

448
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:52,128
Speaker 0: awesome They didn't get past my firewall, but I saw him there.

449
00:30:52,771 --> 00:31:01,950
Speaker 0: awesome things of the day.

450
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:04,160
Speaker 0: Fuck that's all I got.

451
00:31:04,602 --> 00:31:05,044
Speaker 1: that's it.

452
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:05,506
Speaker 1: That's it.

453
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:06,189
Speaker 0: check it out.

454
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:10,370
Speaker 0: I'm sure you might have heard this before, but if you haven't it's rather amusing.

455
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:14,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of things that seem to cover this exact same topic.

456
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:21,665
Speaker 1: You know the many uses of the word fuck But this seemed this one seems to be like a pretty good one, so it's concise.

457
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,327
Speaker 0: It's funny.

458
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:23,290
Speaker 0: It's to the point.

459
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:28,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, you seen this you seen them all so Fucking watch it all right.

460
00:31:28,297 --> 00:31:30,605
Speaker 0: It was a really uncreative use of the word fuck.

461
00:31:30,645 --> 00:31:31,669
Speaker 0: I must say fuck you.

462
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,338
Speaker 1: so I read this article today.

463
00:31:34,378 --> 00:31:36,730
Speaker 1: That was actually pretty interesting.

464
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:42,255
Speaker 1: I don't agree with everything this guy says but I agree with him I guess in spirit.

465
00:31:42,938 --> 00:31:51,167
Speaker 1: the main point of it you can read all the details for yourself Is that the computer mouse the mouse that you you know you move it around with your hand.

466
00:31:51,227 --> 00:31:51,930
Speaker 1: two buttons right?

467
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:59,950
Speaker 1: Except for the two buttons and the scroll wheel if you have one is not an input device of discrete input.

468
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:05,290
Speaker 1: It is an input device of you know a sort of gradient continual input.

469
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,870
Speaker 1: You know now speed at which you movement and directions and vectors.

470
00:32:09,212 --> 00:32:11,850
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make a pedantic argument, but I'm not gonna follow through with it.

471
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,718
Speaker 0: But I point out that it actually is very discreet.

472
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:19,170
Speaker 1: Yes moving on the level pixels pixels picks on the underlying level.

473
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:24,650
Speaker 1: It is a discrete input on the user level as far as your hand and your brain.

474
00:32:25,392 --> 00:32:27,818
Speaker 1: Yes, we're talking about user interface here.

475
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:29,041
Speaker 1: We're not talking about technology.

476
00:32:29,703 --> 00:32:31,608
Speaker 1: It is not a discrete input device.

477
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:37,545
Speaker 1: It is a Gradual continuous input device whereas the keyboard is a discrete input device.

478
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:40,155
Speaker 1: you push s you push K. It does one thing.

479
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:43,210
Speaker 1: there's no more s or less s you're pushing.

480
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:49,630
Speaker 1: You know there's not hitting s harder or softer like there is on the ps2 gamepad where you can hit the circle harder or softer.

481
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,814
Speaker 0: You know it should be that way.

482
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:51,416
Speaker 0: see think of this.

483
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:58,140
Speaker 0: if we had keyboards that were analog sensitive to pressure We wouldn't have to worry about picking a font size anymore.

484
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,751
Speaker 1: I guess yeah, yeah, that'd be alright, but anyway No It wouldn't.

485
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:18,160
Speaker 1: the point he makes is that there are a lot of things the mouse is good for like drawing on the screen or Scrollbars Choosing colors or aiming in an FPS because all of those things require sort of these gradual Continual analog style inputs.

486
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,536
Speaker 1: you know it's not just aim It's where do you want to aim?

487
00:33:22,657 --> 00:33:22,998
Speaker 1: You know what.

488
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,970
Speaker 1: you can't do that with discrete inputs very well.

489
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:29,163
Speaker 1: It sucks to control an FPS entirely with the keyboard right.

490
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:33,429
Speaker 0: you know the first time I played doom I I tried to use the mouse, but I didn't get it.

491
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,435
Speaker 1: I used to play it with my.

492
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:36,959
Speaker 1: I played Wolfenstein 3d mouse.

493
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,105
Speaker 1: only then I did keyboard.

494
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:40,750
Speaker 1: only then I did gamepad.

495
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:41,820
Speaker 1: Then I went back to keyboard.

496
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,485
Speaker 1: only I remember playing only I didn't understand the mouse keyboard combination until I was playing.

497
00:33:48,665 --> 00:33:52,623
Speaker 1: FPS is on my Pentium 3 on the 486.

498
00:33:52,623 --> 00:33:53,810
Speaker 1: I never played them properly.

499
00:33:53,950 --> 00:34:03,122
Speaker 0: I'm telling you playing doom without the mouse is a scary experience especially if you can't strafe because you didn't set that up Because I remember strafing Wolfenstein 3d.

500
00:34:03,162 --> 00:34:05,150
Speaker 1: you would hold down the third button and move the mouse.

501
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:07,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd let go of the third button to stop strafing.

502
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:10,120
Speaker 0: You can still do that even in counter-strike if you really want.

503
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:11,646
Speaker 1: I wouldn't do that if I were you.

504
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:25,177
Speaker 1: nah anyway The point is that he makes in in this thesis I guess is that there are a lot of things we do with the mouse nowadays that are better off That are actually discrete like saving.

505
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:27,103
Speaker 1: there isn't more or less saving.

506
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:29,550
Speaker 1: there isn't saving to the right or saving to the left.

507
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:30,994
Speaker 1: There's save.

508
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:33,141
Speaker 0: and what about save?

509
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:36,170
Speaker 1: as yeah, that's another time No input.

510
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:49,210
Speaker 1: But you know and he points out he makes a pretty decent argument that you it's you're better off using the keyboard for Discrete things because it's a discrete input for a discrete command and you can have muscle memory.

511
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:50,053
Speaker 1: You can.

512
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:52,101
Speaker 1: you can do it with your eyes closed.

513
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:56,217
Speaker 1: You can get you can make a habit of it You know, you can do it a lot faster.

514
00:34:56,438 --> 00:34:59,430
Speaker 1: You don't need to clutter up the screen with extra buttons, etc.

515
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,413
Speaker 1: Etc, etc.

516
00:35:00,654 --> 00:35:05,790
Speaker 1: And in spirit I agree with him and then he proposes a solution that I don't agree with that much.

517
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:16,590
Speaker 1: but this is very interesting to read and I always push people to Learn keyboard shortcuts and use the keyboard properly and I always yell at people when they use their computers inefficiently.

518
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:18,269
Speaker 1: So this is just more of that.

519
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:27,510
Speaker 1: You're gonna be using your computer a lot more efficiently and doing a lot more things in a lot less time and having a much Smoother experience if you learn to use the keyboard.

520
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:32,950
Speaker 0: What it really comes down to is some things are discreet but the mouse won't really hurt you like for example saving.

521
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, just ctrl s or whatever.

522
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:35,990
Speaker 0: your keyboard shortcut is probably a better way.

523
00:35:36,273 --> 00:35:37,427
Speaker 0: You don't need to think about it.

524
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:43,470
Speaker 0: But say you're in a program and you want to make a big edit change or you want to run a filter or something.

525
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:51,529
Speaker 0: Usually if you're doing something like that, there's a lot of thought before doing it and using the mouse Wallet slows you down at the same time.

526
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:55,545
Speaker 0: these aren't the kind of things you'll be doing just all the time willy-nilly without a thought.

527
00:35:55,565 --> 00:36:06,704
Speaker 0: the kind of things you're thinking about and Opening up the filters or the effects menu with the mouse and then seeing it and moving the mouse to your option Gives you time to kind of process what you're doing.

528
00:36:06,744 --> 00:36:07,930
Speaker 0: So you won't do things rashly.

529
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:14,467
Speaker 0: It's kind of the old thing of if your computer was controlled by your brain It would do nothing but delete documents and draw penises.

530
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:18,502
Speaker 1: Yep However, I will point out that saving is not something you should think about.

531
00:36:18,522 --> 00:36:23,727
Speaker 1: you should save all the goddamn time constantly Unless you want to save incrementally.

532
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:26,327
Speaker 1: But then you have CVS or something.

533
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:31,029
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but sometimes you're using a word and you're writing an essay and you're worried the power is gonna go out.

534
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:32,801
Speaker 1: So you want to see versions of word.

535
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:33,466
Speaker 1: do that already?

536
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:36,458
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah But what if you're using your old Windows 95 box?

537
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:40,370
Speaker 1: upgrade your goddamn computer and you got five machine Microsoft works.

538
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:43,315
Speaker 1: Then you're spamming me Turn it off.

539
00:36:43,717 --> 00:36:44,240
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

540
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:58,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, right All right We're not exactly sure a hundred percent exactly where we're gonna go with this topic But it was brought up recently and I listen to a podcast about it recently.

541
00:36:58,126 --> 00:36:59,290
Speaker 0: So the smart one, right?

542
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:06,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I figured we should talk about it in some context gonna talk about how hard drive sort of?

543
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:07,090
Speaker 1: I don't know.

544
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:13,850
Speaker 1: Damage to hard drives hard drive failure how they crash how they keep themselves from crashing what you should do about it.

545
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,244
Speaker 0: It's kind of a cop-out, but we went long in the first half.

546
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:16,968
Speaker 0: You can't complain.

547
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:17,270
Speaker 0: Yeah

548
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:31,110
Speaker 1: Well, basically you might know that when you use your hard drive Sometimes your computer might complain about it or it might say I'm repairing your hard drive It wants to run the scan disk or something like that And what it's doing is doing a few different things on a few different levels.

549
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:40,830
Speaker 1: but in general your hard drive has a lot of stuff in it to Help it keep all the data from getting fucked up which happens all the goddamn time.

550
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:44,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you put data on the hard drive and you don't really think about it.

551
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:54,630
Speaker 0: Your operating system windows is there or Linux and your mp3s and all that stuff and you think even if you listen to all Of our how computers work that all right, my files are a bunch of bits.

552
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:56,310
Speaker 0: Those bits are just written to the hard drive.

553
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:02,950
Speaker 0: There's a lot more to it and luckily your computer doesn't need to know a good goddamn thing about that.

554
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:07,950
Speaker 0: Well computer sends bits to the hard drive saying I want these bits to go on this hard drive in the olden days.

555
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:14,679
Speaker 1: Right, you would buy literally like this is before I even bought computers Like I was like 70s were talking here.

556
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:22,699
Speaker 1: you would buy a platter and you would get like a 10 megabyte platter megabyte people and You would basically wire the platter on.

557
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:33,789
Speaker 1: it's like the platter would have a motor and like a read/write thing on it And you would wire that into your computer and it'd be up to your computer To control the platter and like the logic of what to you know, all that stuff.

558
00:38:34,435 --> 00:38:41,993
Speaker 1: nowadays your Hard drive has a circuit board and a microprocessor attached to it and the hard drive Handles itself.

559
00:38:42,074 --> 00:38:51,745
Speaker 1: it handles the platters on its own and all your computer has to know is write this data read this data Find this data that sort of thing and it just tells the hard drive what to do.

560
00:38:51,826 --> 00:38:55,980
Speaker 1: and the hard drive Handles the platters and that other level on its own.

561
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,605
Speaker 1: and that that's where I. that's what ID is.

562
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:59,130
Speaker 1: It's integrated drive electronics.

563
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:03,424
Speaker 1: That's where we integrated the electronics into the drive before IDE.

564
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:05,370
Speaker 1: It sucked big time.

565
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:07,530
Speaker 0: What it really means is that hard drives are interchangeable.

566
00:39:08,297 --> 00:39:09,709
Speaker 0: Any hard drive will just work?

567
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:17,475
Speaker 0: Because all the logic any like some hard drives use completely different methods to put data in different places or to deal with all their Stuff internally.

568
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:19,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, your computer doesn't need to know anything about that.

569
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:22,398
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I guess think of it this way your can.

570
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:29,841
Speaker 0: your hard drive is doing a lot more behind the scenes than you might be thinking and Your hard drive really doesn't tell you what it's doing.

571
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,250
Speaker 1: so much which is good and bad.

572
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,644
Speaker 1: It's good because well, you don't really need to know that much.

573
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:45,430
Speaker 1: but at the same time There are some things you really want to know because it is Technologically possible that the hard drive could be telling you that it's gonna die soon.

574
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,410
Speaker 1: It could be telling you that something an error just happened and it fixed it.

575
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,287
Speaker 1: It could be telling you all sorts of things and it doesn't.

576
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:57,510
Speaker 0: There have been attempts to make hard drives tell you these things that have met with mixed success.

577
00:39:57,732 --> 00:40:00,210
Speaker 0: One particular example is a technology called smart.

578
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,170
Speaker 0: We're not gonna get into detail.

579
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:04,972
Speaker 1: Let me just say that smart doesn't work Basically.

580
00:40:05,193 --> 00:40:09,105
Speaker 0: suffice to say I used to really like smart when I learned about it when I was young.

581
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:10,530
Speaker 1: the idea of smart is great.

582
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:21,769
Speaker 1: It's that your hard drive will tell you all the stuff that's going on and your computer can monitor it and know it's gonna crash Before it crashes and you can go get a hard drive and do all this preventative maintenance and stuff like that.

583
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:22,119
Speaker 0: Yep.

584
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:25,683
Speaker 0: But in practice smart never really told you anything useful.

585
00:40:25,744 --> 00:40:29,437
Speaker 1: half of drives that crash According to a very good Google study.

586
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:33,552
Speaker 1: because who better to do a study on then on hard drives than Google who has a million Hard drives?

587
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:35,397
Speaker 1: half of drives that crash.

588
00:40:35,738 --> 00:40:38,165
Speaker 1: smart was just saying everything's a okay.

589
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:39,770
Speaker 1: That's how great smart is.

590
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:43,081
Speaker 0: So yeah, you can't trust it if you want to learn more about that.

591
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:45,510
Speaker 0: There's a good episode on security now about it.

592
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:46,643
Speaker 0: I just used to check it out.

593
00:40:46,886 --> 00:40:57,130
Speaker 1: Yep But basically the hard drives even though they don't tell you what they're doing most of the time They are doing some pretty smart things behind the scenes to keep themselves from just fucking you over.

594
00:40:58,031 --> 00:40:59,396
Speaker 1: one thing they do that's like.

595
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:07,125
Speaker 1: the most important thing you should know about is that they have sort of like a Most my hard drives now is they have a spare space on the hard drive.

596
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:17,970
Speaker 1: That's basically space they don't tell you about and a hard drive is divided into sectors and a sector is sort of like Think of it as the smallest unit a hard drive can deal with, you know.

597
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,488
Speaker 1: So if your hard drive has a thousand sectors, it's gonna have way more than that.

598
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:25,478
Speaker 1: Then it can write, you know If it's gonna write or read.

599
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:27,510
Speaker 1: it can write or read one sector at a time.

600
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,628
Speaker 1: It can read them really fast, but it can write or read a sector at a time.

601
00:41:31,294 --> 00:41:38,023
Speaker 1: sometimes a sector Breaks it goes bad or something like that and in the olden days that was doomed.

602
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:40,710
Speaker 1: that basically meant you lost space on your drive.

603
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:44,790
Speaker 1: You've had a 10 megabyte hard drive with a thousand sectors and you lost a sector.

604
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:48,442
Speaker 1: You just lost space and the data that was there gone.

605
00:41:48,864 --> 00:41:50,509
Speaker 1: bad news very bad news.

606
00:41:51,272 --> 00:41:55,686
Speaker 1: Nowadays if a sector on your hard drive goes bad the hard drive knows about it.

607
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:56,650
Speaker 1: It can deal with it.

608
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:06,776
Speaker 1: It takes the data that was there and puts it on another sector somewhere else and you don't actually lose any space because it was Reserving space for just this problem.

609
00:42:07,298 --> 00:42:18,100
Speaker 1: if you get to the point where your computer actually tells you that there's a bad sector They can't be repaired That means all the extra space to put the data from bad sectors in is filled up.

610
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:21,200
Speaker 1: That means your hard drive is going down.

611
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,783
Speaker 1: But of course the only way you're gonna find that out is a smart which might just not be telling you anything or might be Lying

612
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,578
Speaker 0: well like scan disk will tell you yep

613
00:42:28,618 --> 00:42:33,540
Speaker 1: scan But scan disk is based is doing a lot of things basking smart and some things is not asking smart.

614
00:42:33,682 --> 00:42:34,596
Speaker 1: So it's a tough call.

615
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:45,647
Speaker 1: But yeah, there are basically programs that you know force your hard drive to do certain things to test it out You know and some of them will ask smart things But they won't trust smart and you.

616
00:42:45,687 --> 00:42:48,416
Speaker 1: there are tools you can use like scandis that'll that'll.

617
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:49,519
Speaker 1: let you know what's going on.

618
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:59,240
Speaker 0: So basically if your hard drive starts telling you for whatever thing you're using that has got bad sectors Consider it gone and buy a new one immediately.

619
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:05,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, if your hard drives makes weird noises that it wasn't making before buy a new one immediately.

620
00:43:05,682 --> 00:43:14,024
Speaker 0: Yep, the real the only way to really protect your data is to buy a new hard drive probably now before anything goes wrong And also a backup.

621
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,512
Speaker 1: nothing can help you more than a backup.

622
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:20,446
Speaker 1: this I mean there are ways that you can Tools you can use to like.

623
00:43:20,466 --> 00:43:29,536
Speaker 1: if your hard drive goes bad to like, you know, sort of give it the old You know resuscitation a little CPR a little what are those defibrillator action?

624
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:30,720
Speaker 1: and get the data off of it.

625
00:43:31,121 --> 00:43:32,325
Speaker 1: But you can't rely on that.

626
00:43:32,586 --> 00:43:36,680
Speaker 1: You just use that in an emergency, you know, you should be only relying on a backup.

627
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,760
Speaker 1: That is your safest way to go, you know, and even a backup isn't a hundred percent safe.

628
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:46,594
Speaker 0: It's just like 99% safe, which is safe enough Yeah, but I mean, but bear in mind a backup is not just a raid.

629
00:43:46,655 --> 00:43:47,759
Speaker 0: we talked about raid before.

630
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,508
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright, what if I have a mirror?

631
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,680
Speaker 0: So anything I write to one drives on the other drive.

632
00:43:51,680 --> 00:44:03,353
Speaker 0: So if one drive dies the other drives fine that's well and good unless something screws up the data that's being written to the drive or You accidentally type RM - RF star in a place.

633
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:04,557
Speaker 0: You shouldn't have with permissions.

634
00:44:04,577 --> 00:44:16,518
Speaker 1: You shouldn't have had Yep, and the only way you can save that is if you had a backup in a hard drive that was unplugged Sitting on your shelf or data corruption or viruses or all sorts of problems.

635
00:44:16,538 --> 00:44:16,999
Speaker 0: You could have.

636
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:18,892
Speaker 0: Backups are the only way to save you.

637
00:44:18,913 --> 00:44:23,200
Speaker 1: Yep Alright, let's not keep repeating how backups the only way to save you.

638
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:24,804
Speaker 0: Yeah Now at the same time.

639
00:44:24,824 --> 00:44:29,516
Speaker 0: I'd like to bring this up because this is something I've done at work and in my professional life for a long time.

640
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,160
Speaker 0: People always, you know, if you delete a file.

641
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:36,039
Speaker 0: I know you've probably heard this before deleting a file does not make it go away.

642
00:44:36,503 --> 00:44:38,360
Speaker 0: Different file systems handle things different way.

643
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:49,520
Speaker 0: But basically when you delete a file most file systems in some way say Alright, all those places where the data for that file is are now free to be overwritten exactly because remember your file system.

644
00:44:49,520 --> 00:45:00,199
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna go into file system architecture But basically there's an area on your hard drive that says this file is over there This file is over there this files over there and then there's the other area where the files are.

645
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:09,670
Speaker 1: So when you want to open up I don't know read me dot text You go to the hard drive and it says read me dot text is over there and You go over there and that's where the text file is.

646
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:16,920
Speaker 1: when you delete read me dot text It doesn't actually remove all the ones and zeros because why is it gonna write zeros to that place?

647
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,580
Speaker 0: That just takes more performance, right?

648
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:23,620
Speaker 1: All it does is it goes to the place that says read me dot text is over there and erases that.

649
00:45:24,062 --> 00:45:26,455
Speaker 1: So now when you say what files are there?

650
00:45:26,555 --> 00:45:33,255
Speaker 1: It says well Geek nights that wave is over there and you know cool game that exes over there.

651
00:45:33,576 --> 00:45:34,800
Speaker 1: and you say what about reading me dot text?

652
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,438
Speaker 1: It's like what read me that text are you talking about?

653
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:42,461
Speaker 1: But the files still their files still there the zeros and ones that made up read me dot text are still where they used to Be.

654
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,120
Speaker 1: the file system just doesn't know the file exists.

655
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,014
Speaker 1: It doesn't know where it is.

656
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:52,733
Speaker 1: But if you're smart and clever and you use various tools You can go and go to the place where reading me dot text still is.

657
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:59,520
Speaker 1: as long as it hasn't been overwritten yet It's still there and you can read it now, of course this depends a lot on the file system.

658
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:11,460
Speaker 0: It depends on a lot of things and generally the more you have used your computer since you deleted a file the less likely Yes, the data is still there because the greater the odds are that the data has been overwritten with a new file or something like that.

659
00:46:11,862 --> 00:46:14,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, uh, say you want to delete data securely.

660
00:46:14,918 --> 00:46:21,919
Speaker 0: Well, all right What if I just have a program that writes all zeros to the drive and you know what that works pretty damn Well, that works really well.

661
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:34,620
Speaker 1: like it takes a lot of money and a lot of time to get the data back if someone just wrote zeros to the Entire drive because you now you lost where the files are where they begin and end you're in big trouble.

662
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:44,600
Speaker 0: But at the same time because you just wrote uniform data over the drive Alright, there is still the trace of the data because the actual data isn't real ones and zeros.

663
00:46:44,861 --> 00:46:48,940
Speaker 0: It's magnets magnetic fields that are imprinted onto this magnetic medium.

664
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:51,500
Speaker 1: So you had all these magnetic fields and some of them are zero.

665
00:46:51,801 --> 00:46:52,766
Speaker 0: There's a pattern there.

666
00:46:52,947 --> 00:46:55,219
Speaker 0: you apply a uniform pattern to it to obliterate it.

667
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,428
Speaker 0: But traces of that pattern are still there.

668
00:46:57,749 --> 00:46:58,874
Speaker 0: and because it's digital.

669
00:46:58,914 --> 00:46:59,978
Speaker 0: It's either a one or zero.

670
00:47:00,962 --> 00:47:10,160
Speaker 0: It's really not out of the realm at all to use fancy hardware or possibly even software in certain Circumstances to figure out what used to be on that drive.

671
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:16,639
Speaker 1: Yep, people have done it in labs and things and if you write all zeros to your hard drive They might not get everything back.

672
00:47:17,121 --> 00:47:22,379
Speaker 1: But they if someone wants to really badly they can get your data off of that drive.

673
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,206
Speaker 0: now Of course the real answer.

674
00:47:24,326 --> 00:47:26,053
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not getting into the details.

675
00:47:26,114 --> 00:47:27,158
Speaker 0: I don't want to go long about this.

676
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:30,490
Speaker 0: is D Ban DB an just Google for that.

677
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:42,360
Speaker 0: You can put it on a flash drive put it on a floppy disk and Basically, it will write random or semi random data in multiple many passes over the data You want to get rid of and will fucking delete fucking drive.

678
00:47:42,922 --> 00:47:46,455
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I guess there might be a way to come back from that but it's not.

679
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:47,780
Speaker 1: no it's needs not realistic.

680
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,706
Speaker 1: It's sort of like yeah, you might be able to decrypt that 4096 bit key.

681
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:53,774
Speaker 0: maybe see that's another way.

682
00:47:53,794 --> 00:47:56,749
Speaker 0: if you don't want it if you can't well I guess if you can't is stupid.

683
00:47:56,769 --> 00:48:03,300
Speaker 0: but instead of deleting data One thing you could do is encrypt it with very strong encryption and then not keep the key.

684
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:08,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing you're trying to prevent here is like let's say I buy a new hard drive and I throw out the old one.

685
00:48:08,602 --> 00:48:10,509
Speaker 1: I don't want someone digging up that old hard drive.

686
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:21,700
Speaker 1: or if I sell a hard drive on eBay or if I Leave my company and I had stuff on the hard drive there, you know And I don't want anyone to see what it was ID ban any computer that I leave behind when I quit a company.

687
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:33,347
Speaker 1: Yep, you know I just you know I don't want people to get it data because I let a hard drive go out of my possession and the two ways to stop That are to D ban the drive After I let it out of my possession.

688
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:38,386
Speaker 1: by the way D band stands for Derek's boot and nuke because a guy named Derek wrote The software called boot and nuke.

689
00:48:38,848 --> 00:48:40,736
Speaker 1: is you boot the software and then it nukes your drive.

690
00:48:40,776 --> 00:48:40,937
Speaker 0: Yep.

691
00:48:41,158 --> 00:48:42,042
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool I like it.

692
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:42,866
Speaker 0: I like it a lot.

693
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:45,480
Speaker 0: I've used it in professional capacity for a long time.

694
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,438
Speaker 1: It's a very professional tool.

695
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:49,180
Speaker 1: The other thing you can do is just encrypt your drive.

696
00:48:49,260 --> 00:49:02,409
Speaker 1: There are ways that you can have all the data on your hard drive be encrypted at all times And the only way to have to get the data off your drive would be to use your computer with your password and your software that decrypts it.

697
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:07,085
Speaker 1: and if anyone took the stole that hard drive from you and Plugged it into their own computer.

698
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:10,940
Speaker 1: They'd have basically an impossible time reading any of that data.

699
00:49:11,145 --> 00:49:20,340
Speaker 0: Of course then we have to talk again about side channel information because by encrypting the data or Theoretically by using D band because the data it writes could be construed as encrypted data.

700
00:49:22,103 --> 00:49:24,740
Speaker 0: Alright now it's kind of like when I duct tape that book together.

701
00:49:25,302 --> 00:49:28,958
Speaker 0: I don't know what's on this drive, but I know whatever it is the dude encrypted it.

702
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:41,412
Speaker 0: Yep That's why you got to encrypt and then if you give it to someone boot a nuke or more importantly There are ways to encrypt that give you levels of deniability Where you can have nested levels of encryption or all sorts of fun stuff.

703
00:49:41,452 --> 00:49:43,660
Speaker 0: that is really beyond the scope of tonight's show.

704
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:46,248
Speaker 1: Yes, the point is that hard drives.

705
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,532
Speaker 1: They're pretty fickle.

706
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:51,965
Speaker 1: They can get damaged pretty easily and The data on them.

707
00:49:52,386 --> 00:49:55,840
Speaker 1: It's it's actually not trivial to make it go away for real.

708
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:59,320
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess you could just ruin the drive like if you smashed it with a hammer.

709
00:49:59,822 --> 00:50:03,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean theoretically you could get the data back, but that's kind of silly at that point.

710
00:50:04,923 --> 00:50:07,219
Speaker 1: No, it takes a lot of money and a lot of time to do it.

711
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,519
Speaker 1: See if you make it more trouble than it's worth then you pretty much win.

712
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:16,819
Speaker 0: Suffice to say just remember that when you delete a file, it's probably still there in some form for quite some time.

713
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:17,301
Speaker 1: Yep.

714
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:18,024
Speaker 1: All right.

715
00:50:18,084 --> 00:50:20,775
Speaker 1: Now what are some ways that you can you know.

716
00:50:20,855 --> 00:50:28,725
Speaker 1: besides, you know Keeping an eye on your hard drives and replacing them when they're about to crash if you find out they're gonna crash Or they have bad sectors.

717
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:32,720
Speaker 1: What are some ways you can make your hard drives last longer and not crash so much?

718
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:38,262
Speaker 0: Well, one thing is very simply you can use the power management of your computer to have the drive spin down when you're not using Them.

719
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:39,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a pretty big deal.

720
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,060
Speaker 1: I mean a hard drive is rated to only turn on and off so many times, you know.

721
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,860
Speaker 1: And if it goes if you turn it on and off more times than that, it's it's eventually that it's gonna near death.

722
00:50:51,101 --> 00:50:56,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time leaving it spinning all the time does theoretically introduce wear and tear.

723
00:50:56,632 --> 00:50:58,767
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean the thing that's gonna kill your hard drive most.

724
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:04,166
Speaker 1: the problem is is that it's a motor moving parts things moving back And forth stuff like that.

725
00:51:04,307 --> 00:51:07,920
Speaker 1: So you want it to move as little as possible.

726
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:20,860
Speaker 1: So if you're doing something on your computer or let's say you're not doing anything on your computer You're just leaving it on while you go downstairs to get a drink Why should your computer sit there for hours with the hard drive motor spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning?

727
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,160
Speaker 1: You want to configure your computer to turn that motor off when it doesn't need to be spinning.

728
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:33,820
Speaker 0: But at the same time watch out because there's the problem of and this happened to me a bunch of times at IBM We have a server that hasn't been rebooted or anything in years.

729
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,600
Speaker 0: It's just been sitting there plugging along with OS 2. we turn it off to do some maintenance.

730
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:40,954
Speaker 0: The hard drive just doesn't spin back up.

731
00:51:41,336 --> 00:51:44,026
Speaker 1: Yep Stuff like that happens.

732
00:51:44,086 --> 00:51:46,698
Speaker 1: It's just the nature of motors and lubrication.

733
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:47,662
Speaker 1: and yeah I like that.

734
00:51:47,682 --> 00:51:52,784
Speaker 0: the real answer there is simple if you've got a drive that you suspect is anything wrong with it There's even a chance.

735
00:51:52,864 --> 00:51:58,859
Speaker 0: get the data off of it before you spin it down or turn it off because there's a there's a small Chance that it's not gonna come back.

736
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:10,859
Speaker 1: Another thing got to watch out for especially in laptops like to do this is what the laptop, you know Cuz they want to save power will turn off a hard drive pretty quickly like maybe every 10 minutes Maybe even every 5 minutes if you're not using it.

737
00:52:11,282 --> 00:52:18,818
Speaker 1: But what happens is you might end up in a situation where you know Your computer turns the hard drive off or spins it down then it spins it back up and it spins it down.

738
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:20,305
Speaker 1: then it spins It back up and it spins down.

739
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:23,060
Speaker 1: spinning up and down constantly like that is not helping.

740
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,320
Speaker 1: It's hurting a lot and your hard drives life will be significantly diminished if you do that.

741
00:52:27,601 --> 00:52:31,259
Speaker 0: Yep, so that's really a fine line and I guess in the end we can't give good advice about it.

742
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,900
Speaker 1: You need to sort of configure it based on your particular use case.

743
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:41,821
Speaker 1: You know to do this when the batteries for using your laptop battery and do something different when your laptops plugged in and stuff like That.

744
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:43,090
Speaker 0: here's a much bigger factor.

745
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,660
Speaker 0: This is probably the primary factor.

746
00:52:45,222 --> 00:52:47,308
Speaker 0: It all comes down to heat the hotter your heart.

747
00:52:47,449 --> 00:52:49,255
Speaker 1: actually according to the Google study.

748
00:52:49,556 --> 00:52:52,264
Speaker 1: The heat didn't matter so much I forgot about that.

749
00:52:52,444 --> 00:52:59,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically cuz that that IBM heat was gospel and anytime the cooling went out in the data center Hard drives would die for the next.

750
00:52:59,628 --> 00:53:01,175
Speaker 1: well, he does matter.

751
00:53:01,355 --> 00:53:02,420
Speaker 1: right heat is important.

752
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:11,044
Speaker 1: But if your hard drive, you know It's gonna make heat if it goes cuz the hard drives had fast spinning motors and they're spinning magnetic discs There's gonna be heat.

753
00:53:11,165 --> 00:53:20,080
Speaker 1: it happens if it gets over a certain temperature It's gonna fail cuz it's just too hot for the hard drive, you know, it gets too hot Stuff's gonna break down inside and it's game over.

754
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:30,603
Speaker 1: But as long as you're not going over the point of too hot for the hard drive it like, you know You put it in like a tiny case and it's very poorly You know.

755
00:53:30,623 --> 00:53:34,434
Speaker 1: then as long as you don't go over like a hot, you know, the crazy temperature.

756
00:53:34,455 --> 00:53:36,240
Speaker 1: It's probably okay.

757
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:45,874
Speaker 0: However, a lot of people do end up going over the crazy temperature because they never clean their computers They never dusted or they have like a little shuttle case and there isn't a fan blowing over the hard drive and there's all.

758
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,637
Speaker 0: Like you live in a house with cats and you're a smoker and you've never opened your computer.

759
00:53:51,657 --> 00:54:01,900
Speaker 1: Yep Another thing is that actually if you keep hard drives too cold Google actually found out that that actually kind of makes them fail a little more often.

760
00:54:02,222 --> 00:54:05,337
Speaker 1: But it's kind of hard to keep them too cold because hard drives heat up on their own.

761
00:54:05,397 --> 00:54:10,199
Speaker 1: pretty nice Yep, you'd have to like literally put it in a freezer to make it, you know fail from being too cold.

762
00:54:11,162 --> 00:54:17,540
Speaker 1: Another thing that makes heart the biggest thing that makes hard drives fail more often is just did you buy a hard drive?

763
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,703
Speaker 1: that's prone to failure.

764
00:54:19,164 --> 00:54:28,896
Speaker 1: now hard drives are more prone to failure if they have more platters because he basically a hard drive is a bunch of magnetic disks and some hard drives have more magnetic disks than others.

765
00:54:28,997 --> 00:54:35,320
Speaker 1: like a 20 gig drive has one disk and a 40 gig drive has two 20 gig disks and a 60 has three of them.

766
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:37,568
Speaker 1: But an 80 has maybe four.

767
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:45,678
Speaker 1: but you might be able to get an 80 that just has one 80 gig disk and then you can get a 160. that's 280 gig disks and so on.

768
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:57,719
Speaker 1: and it's you have to really look up on the internet and research how many platters are in your drive because a platter and a drive with one read/write head on it is has a rate of failure.

769
00:54:57,739 --> 00:55:05,640
Speaker 1: if You have two of those in your drive You're basically doubling the rate of failure because if either one fails the whole hard drive is done.

770
00:55:06,447 --> 00:55:16,934
Speaker 1: If there's three of them in there You've tripled the rate of failure because even though all of them are equally reliable Individually if any one fails even if the other two still work the drive is done for

771
00:55:17,155 --> 00:55:28,278
Speaker 0: well notice how the same thing applied with Raid multiple hard drives that are rated in a way that isn't redundant, which I guess it's just an 8 at that point Yep, then if any one drive fails your data is fucked.

772
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:42,620
Speaker 1: Yep that's why you want to have you know hard drives with fewer platters in a raid that is Redundant and then you're pretty safe because your hard drives are not likely to crash and you got the redundancy going on.

773
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:56,653
Speaker 0: But at the same time I've read numerous articles pointing to the fact that if you take Hard drives that aren't designed to be used in a raid configuration and use them in a raid configuration Generally that puts a lot more stress on the drives than just typical normal use.

774
00:55:57,014 --> 00:56:06,540
Speaker 0: if you make a raid five out of drives that Aren't quite prepared for that You're probably going to increase your data safety overall But at the same time decrease the total lifespan of all your drives.

775
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:12,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically another huge factor and maybe the biggest I'm not sure is that expensive drives?

776
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:16,999
Speaker 1: You know, they're really expensive ones that people buy for servers and the ones that cost more money.

777
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:19,770
Speaker 1: They're generally just better than the cheap ones.

778
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:21,136
Speaker 1: The cheap ones are made cheaply.

779
00:56:21,176 --> 00:56:22,140
Speaker 1: They care less about them.

780
00:56:22,361 --> 00:56:27,280
Speaker 0: They basically don't buy that 40 gig Western Digital that you saw at someone's garage sale.

781
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:29,567
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz that's that's gonna crash.

782
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:31,111
Speaker 0: don't buy used hard drives.

783
00:56:31,432 --> 00:56:34,040
Speaker 1: don't buy the ultra discount hard drive on Newegg.

784
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:36,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh the extra mile unless you don't care.

785
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:46,800
Speaker 1: but go the extra mile and pay the extra 20 bucks to get the higher quality Hard drive, it'll probably be faster be better in quality and last you a lot longer.

786
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,689
Speaker 0: You might wonder why?

787
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,246
Speaker 0: room and Scott if you not recommended a particular brand?

788
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:56,311
Speaker 0: and the problem is that there's no way to know which brand is Absolutely better because it's almost all anecdotal.

789
00:56:56,432 --> 00:57:02,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, and basically, you know I mean in general like I personally Western Digital and Seagate.

790
00:57:02,778 --> 00:57:03,420
Speaker 1: awesome, right?

791
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,971
Speaker 0: I have often used Seagate and max tour.

792
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:06,835
Speaker 0: diamond maxes about.

793
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:10,640
Speaker 1: Seagate bought max tour So yeah, but back before and max door bought quantum.

794
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:17,688
Speaker 0: So if all the max stores that I owned only one failed and it was about time for that one to fail Yeah, I've never had a Seagate fail ever.

795
00:57:17,808 --> 00:57:19,616
Speaker 1: So it's just anecdotal.

796
00:57:19,656 --> 00:57:20,439
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean anything.

797
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:26,756
Speaker 1: Yes, I've always bought really expensive fancy Seagate's and I know a lot of people who bought really expensive.

798
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,380
Speaker 1: Western Digitals are really expensive.

799
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:33,035
Speaker 1: Itachi drives and like Hitachi invented that perpendicular whatever and they don't fail either.

800
00:57:33,437 --> 00:57:37,800
Speaker 0: but yet like at IBM We'd buy the fanciest fanciest drives and sometimes they'd fail.

801
00:57:37,902 --> 00:57:38,500
Speaker 1: Well, that's you know.

802
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,367
Speaker 1: It depends on how much stress you're putting them under.

803
00:57:40,387 --> 00:57:43,277
Speaker 1: yeah that fancy drive and put it in a normal desktop computer.

804
00:57:43,298 --> 00:57:46,260
Speaker 1: odds Are it's gonna last a long fucking time.

805
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,931
Speaker 0: The problem is there's no real good data on what brand is actually better.

806
00:57:50,052 --> 00:57:58,620
Speaker 1: and even if you have the best data and it'll say Okay, if you buy this drive and use it for this purpose in this machine odds are it'll you know?

807
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,913
Speaker 1: It won't fail for five years, but those are just the odds.

808
00:58:01,953 --> 00:58:04,729
Speaker 1: you could lose your gambling, you know The odds are in your favor.

809
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:08,513
Speaker 1: Maybe it's ten to one odds But you that could be the one in ten drive.

810
00:58:08,533 --> 00:58:09,518
Speaker 1: the crashes you don't know.

811
00:58:10,141 --> 00:58:15,220
Speaker 0: See now notice that all the advice we've given really wasn't advice because there were two sides of every coin so far.

812
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:21,940
Speaker 0: Yep, that's because the only actual answer is back your data up back it up back it up on something.

813
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:25,575
Speaker 1: There is one thing you should keep in mind though hard drives.

814
00:58:25,776 --> 00:58:28,165
Speaker 1: if they have a problem Like let's say there are manufacture.

815
00:58:28,185 --> 00:58:30,092
Speaker 1: You have a drive that was manufactured poorly.

816
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:38,279
Speaker 1: It's gonna die in about a year So it's gonna die pretty soon If you have a drive that's lasted you for at least a year or more.

817
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:46,791
Speaker 1: There probably weren't any manufacturing problems with that drive and you can bet on it Pretty surely that it's gonna last a few more years.

818
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:55,664
Speaker 0: and until it's you know until it wears out It's kind of this plateau of reliability and this applies to a lot of applies to cars do and a lot of anything Anything you buy.

819
00:58:55,684 --> 00:58:58,031
Speaker 0: if it doesn't fail immediately.

820
00:58:58,392 --> 00:59:01,160
Speaker 0: It's probably going to last relatively long.

821
00:59:01,461 --> 00:59:05,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you buy a washing machine and the washing machine works and it keeps working for months.

822
00:59:06,401 --> 00:59:12,780
Speaker 1: Then it was made correctly and it's only gonna break from wear and tear from using it a whole lot over time.

823
00:59:13,202 --> 00:59:14,306
Speaker 1: It's not gonna break from.

824
00:59:14,326 --> 00:59:17,860
Speaker 1: you know, oh they didn't wire that thing properly or something like that.

825
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:21,160
Speaker 1: You know cars are the same way if your car doesn't explode off the lot.

826
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:27,259
Speaker 1: Then it was made manufactured properly in the factory and it's gonna last you until the.

827
00:59:27,419 --> 00:59:32,478
Speaker 1: you know The pistons start to wear out and you know, the cables break and the car wears down.

828
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:38,880
Speaker 0: granted It's not quite as clear-cut cut with hard drives and the curve is not as clean as anyone would like it to be.

829
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:51,400
Speaker 1: Well, a hard drive is unique in that it is a mechanical device that moves a hell of a lot Stays on all the time a lot of the time has a fast spinning motor Generates a lot of heat that isn't dissipated super efficiently.

830
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:55,510
Speaker 1: It's just chumming or humming away all the time crazily.

831
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,696
Speaker 1: It's it's and it's magnetic.

832
00:59:57,757 --> 00:59:58,780
Speaker 1: It's a very fickle device.

833
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:06,966
Speaker 0: I really look forward to the day when magnetic hard drives are only backups and all of my real live data is on some sort Of solid-state.

834
01:00:07,329 --> 01:00:08,780
Speaker 0: non flash medium.

835
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I said non flash because flash has problems of its own.

836
01:00:12,737 --> 01:00:16,553
Speaker 0: flash is awesome Except for its numerous and manifold problems.

837
01:00:16,794 --> 01:00:22,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, and flash is awesome But you can only read and write it so many times and then it's just done.

838
01:00:22,895 --> 01:00:25,063
Speaker 1: and it's not like so many times till it Wears out.

839
01:00:25,184 --> 01:00:32,680
Speaker 1: it's like so many times set in stone Like you can read and write one bit of the flash like five thousand times and then it's done.

840
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:38,380
Speaker 0: Flash memory actually does interesting things where it'll look at the data You're trying to write to it and try to fit it over data.

841
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,900
Speaker 0: You're overriding in such a way as to change as few bits as possible.

842
01:00:42,282 --> 01:00:45,560
Speaker 1: But that has to be done in the software and not in the flash itself.

843
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:51,957
Speaker 0: Yes, because that has to be balanced by the speed of because anytime you do anything like that That's gonna take time and slow down your data rate.

844
01:00:52,643 --> 01:00:57,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you're trying to write something quickly You know Like let's say you're trying to take pictures really fast on your camera.

845
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:08,204
Speaker 1: if your camera doesn't have a lot of RAM It's got a right to that flash real fast And it can't bother be bothered writing to the flash in such a way to prolong the luckily For all its drawbacks.

846
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:13,760
Speaker 1: flash is stupidly cheap and still it's not stupidly cheap, but it's pretty cheap and awesome.

847
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:15,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I was looking and cuz we need.

848
01:01:15,807 --> 01:01:19,280
Speaker 0: we just bought actually for a compact flash isn't really flash?

849
01:01:19,621 --> 01:01:21,408
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of them have hard drives in there.

850
01:01:21,549 --> 01:01:23,055
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but those are clearly set.

851
01:01:23,075 --> 01:01:24,320
Speaker 0: they say they're micro drives instead.

852
01:01:24,521 --> 01:01:26,027
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I was thinking of getting one of those.

853
01:01:26,188 --> 01:01:26,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were.

854
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:33,552
Speaker 0: it's compact flash is an interface not an actual You know, yeah, but they're pretty much either flash or a micro drive.

855
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:35,960
Speaker 1: Yep, pretty much and go in the same slot.

856
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:42,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, they both have frozen cons, but we just bought actually for geek nights a super fancy portable solid-state recorder.

857
01:01:42,702 --> 01:01:48,800
Speaker 1: It's gonna be pretty awesome because now we can go to conventions and places and this thing records Like as good as our computer records.

858
01:01:49,182 --> 01:01:59,805
Speaker 1: So when we're recording the show, we'll just simultaneously record to it And if something goes wrong We still have the show on there in perfect quality and if we go to a convention We want to record something.

859
01:02:00,247 --> 01:02:03,440
Speaker 1: We just plug it into this thing and it records perfectly.

860
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:09,064
Speaker 0: So, I mean we've recorded a bunch of stuff at cons before but now we don't have to pull out the Mac Pull out the

861
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:09,568
Speaker 1: monitor

862
01:02:09,749 --> 01:02:11,822
Speaker 0: hook it all up plug in the compressor You

863
01:02:11,842 --> 01:02:15,700
Speaker 1: think one wire and put it in a little black battery-powered box and push a button.

864
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:18,448
Speaker 0: So we got to buy a gigantic pile of flash for this thing.

865
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:19,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do.

866
01:02:20,201 --> 01:02:24,340
Speaker 1: It's a good thing though that you just record mp3 and then we can have a lot of audio in a little bit.

867
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:27,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll play with it because we might use wave to flash is pretty cheap.

868
01:02:28,037 --> 01:02:28,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all.

869
01:02:29,321 --> 01:02:34,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, the sad thing is this thing cost more than all of the other equipment we've ever bought for geek nights combined.

870
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:38,900
Speaker 1: It's a very professional piece of equipment and I you know, I think it's worth it to head.

871
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,540
Speaker 0: I almost wish I'd bought the more expensive one, but the extra 200 bucks was not gonna.

872
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:44,063
Speaker 1: Well, I do agree.

873
01:02:44,103 --> 01:02:46,671
Speaker 1: The more expensive one definitely was clearly superior.

874
01:02:46,711 --> 01:02:49,580
Speaker 1: It was clearly superior and so is the more expensive hard drive.

875
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:51,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, and on that note, I think we're done.

876
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:55,320
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go nurse my wound and possibly eat some food.

877
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:56,453
Speaker 1: I gotta eat some fucking food.

878
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:56,817
Speaker 1: God damn.

879
01:02:56,857 --> 01:03:06,902
