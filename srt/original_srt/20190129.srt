1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,742
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday January 29th 2019.

2
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:15,190
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm scared and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,776
Speaker 1: We are reviewing the 2014 board game.

4
00:00:18,197 --> 00:00:21,877
Speaker 0: La Cosa Nostra Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,682 --> 00:00:29,840
Speaker 1: We're finally fully back from all those Pax's all those mag fests all that biz.

6
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:33,735
Speaker 1: All we got coming up is Pax East which won't significantly disrupt geek nights.

7
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:40,440
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm We would have done a show last week, maybe two shows, but I did get a Pax Fox.

8
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:43,080
Speaker 1: It took a few days to kick in but I got a full-on Pax Fox.

9
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:44,691
Speaker 0: There's a Pax Fox Twitter account.

10
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:45,799
Speaker 0: if anyone it's pretty good.

11
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:54,125
Speaker 1: I tweeted at that Twitter account and was like yo, I got the Pax Fox and it actually was like, thank you It's pretty good account.

12
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:56,215
Speaker 1: I'm still fighting off the tail end of that Pax Fox.

13
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:57,120
Speaker 0: Oh, why am I here?

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,126
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see if Emily comes down with it.

15
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:00,969
Speaker 1: Why am I here?

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,811
Speaker 1: I don't know.

17
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:03,316
Speaker 0: I'm unboxed.

18
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,743
Speaker 1: Don't don't touch anything Okay.

19
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:09,500
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, the thing is when I was sickest was when we skipped the show last week.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,285
Speaker 1: So stay tuned.

21
00:01:10,628 --> 00:01:14,665
Speaker 1: our next Wednesday show will be Spider-man into the spider-verse.

22
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:20,625
Speaker 0: I have basically no plans until like weekend plans until Pax East except for a few small things Nothing.

23
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:24,628
Speaker 0: So there's gonna be a Consistent yeek nights now until March ish.

24
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:26,294
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that'll be good times.

25
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:26,615
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:28,763
Speaker 0: So I guess president's day I don't have to work.

27
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:29,547
Speaker 0: We'll see what goes around.

28
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll probably go skiing that whole weekend.

29
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:32,260
Speaker 0: See what goes on there.

30
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we're gonna be playing a lot of games.

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,251
Speaker 1: I'm gonna.

32
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:37,560
Speaker 1: I'm gonna actually start streaming some advanced wars.

33
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,204
Speaker 1: I've just been feeling that mm-hmm Might stream some other games.

34
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:42,168
Speaker 1: I've been playing recently.

35
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:45,379
Speaker 1: I will not stream VR chat because good fucking God.

36
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:48,192
Speaker 0: So I got kicked off to it.

37
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:49,019
Speaker 1: What do you got in the news?

38
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,122
Speaker 0: Well, so first of all I just want to briefly cuz you're gonna probably do a full episode on this at some point if I can get rim to actually Play it.

39
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:58,216
Speaker 0: There's a hot new thing called auto chess.

40
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:04,760
Speaker 0: if you haven't heard of it It is a mod for dota 2 which is totally free because dota 2 is free and the mod is free on the steam workshop.

41
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:18,360
Speaker 0: And basically it's a game where you draft units from a common pool but you spend money you put the units out in the field and then they fight and Then you draft more units and they fight and if you get three of the same unit they combine.

42
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,400
Speaker 0: So if you get nine of the same unit you get three level two guys.

43
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,744
Speaker 0: They combine to a level three guy.

44
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:24,791
Speaker 0: you get the idea and you get up.

45
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:32,420
Speaker 0: you're up against copies of other people's armies that come To your battlefield every round and there's no reason for the other person to be sitting there, right?

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,292
Speaker 0: You don't have to do any micro because it's auto chess.

47
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:36,055
Speaker 0: They just fight you.

48
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:37,200
Speaker 0: all you do is position them.

49
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:46,220
Speaker 0: You know you draft dudes make armies manage your resources sell dudes put them in the field See how they fight rearrange them by different guys, right?

50
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,919
Speaker 0: And you're all drawing from the same pool of dudes.

51
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,090
Speaker 0: So if rim buys all the warlocks guess what?

52
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:51,940
Speaker 0: there's a lot less warlocks in the common pool.

53
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:54,994
Speaker 0: My odds of drawing a warlock to buy are less.

54
00:02:55,296 --> 00:03:01,280
Speaker 0: there is some RNG But this game is way fun, but also way jank because it's a dota 2 mod.

55
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if anyone out there is a game developer make a non jank elegant version of auto chess.

56
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,487
Speaker 0: I can totally help you.

57
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:09,720
Speaker 1: Yep doesn't even have to be that great.

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,089
Speaker 1: Just be the first one to make a polished experience.

59
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:13,233
Speaker 1: if you just take this.

60
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:19,520
Speaker 0: like this core concept is Relatively new and unique even though it combines some existing mechanics like drafting.

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,008
Speaker 0: Yeah If someone makes a polished version of this core concept You will kick ass the same way.

62
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:32,320
Speaker 0: fortnight kicked pub G's ass in terms of polishing a turd Not like, you know polishing something that wasn't as good.

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:45,280
Speaker 1: I feel like this will scratch the same itch in some ways because remember all those kind of janky PC games that were like Make an army of liches or whatever in a stacked order and they'll kind of auto fight against other people's armies.

64
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,220
Speaker 1: But they were all like text-based websites like no graphics.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,088
Speaker 0: This would make a great tabletop game.

66
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,036
Speaker 0: This is like it's got a lot going for it.

67
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:53,000
Speaker 0: It's really good.

68
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:54,484
Speaker 0: Definitely try it out.

69
00:03:54,504 --> 00:04:02,613
Speaker 0: the bad UI almost had me quit early on as I have done many times But I'm only playing this enough to review it.

70
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:04,562
Speaker 1: I ain't gonna play it long term I don't think.

71
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,720
Speaker 0: I've almost gave it up after like round the first play.

72
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:13,956
Speaker 0: I was ready to bash the developers face in for making such a bad UI But then I got it in round two.

73
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,062
Speaker 0: in round two I didn't.

74
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:19,964
Speaker 0: I fucked up way less and was able the fun was able to shine through over the UI.

75
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,456
Speaker 0: that still makes me want to kill somebody.

76
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:23,886
Speaker 0: so There you have it.

77
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:24,349
Speaker 0: You got to check.

78
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:25,719
Speaker 0: the auto chess is the new hotness.

79
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,509
Speaker 1: We didn't say hey, maybe we should.

80
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,677
Speaker 1: we said you should because I ain't got time.

81
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:31,440
Speaker 0: I ain't got time for that.

82
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,402
Speaker 0: Yeah I already got.

83
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:32,643
Speaker 0: I can.

84
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:36,317
Speaker 0: I can consult with you in exchange for a fee and I'll tell you a guarantee.

85
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:39,127
Speaker 0: if you follow my Advice you will make an amazing game.

86
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:40,933
Speaker 1: We already got like 1.25 like games.

87
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:42,157
Speaker 1: We're actually working on it.

88
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:43,200
Speaker 0: All I got time for is advice.

89
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:44,419
Speaker 0: Anyway, so real news.

90
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:55,214
Speaker 0: So we already talked about in a previous ignites episode about the epic stored right other stores trying to compete with steam Right in the whole deal with having too many game stores or not enough game stores and

91
00:04:55,254 --> 00:05:00,317
Speaker 1: all this nonsense like people thinking that Influencers will be the way to get people to buy their game

92
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:00,760
Speaker 0: anyway.

93
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,232
Speaker 0: So what's happening now is for there's.

94
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:09,360
Speaker 0: there's now going to be this game called Metro Exodus Which is there's a FPS called Metro.

95
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:20,454
Speaker 0: It's a FPS series called called Metro that involves like FPSing and sort of a post Apocalyptic Russian ish kind of space with like monsters and shit.

96
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:21,597
Speaker 0: I played one of them once.

97
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:23,111
Speaker 0: I got it for free or something I don't know.

98
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:27,080
Speaker 0: But anyway, the new one is coming out and you can pre-order it on Steam.

99
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:28,847
Speaker 0: But they just announced.

100
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:32,300
Speaker 0: guess what this game is going to be exclusive to the epic store.

101
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,460
Speaker 1: Well for one year, right?

102
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:35,845
Speaker 0: Which means so?

103
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:40,141
Speaker 0: this is because the steam store charges the developers 30%.

104
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:44,490
Speaker 0: So if I sell a game on Steam for 10 bucks Valve takes three bucks and I get seven bucks.

105
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:49,369
Speaker 0: if you sell a game on the epic store The epic store takes what 10 or 15 percent?

106
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,112
Speaker 0: I think 15.

107
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:50,393
Speaker 0: Yeah.

108
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:51,417
Speaker 1: I already forget.

109
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:52,381
Speaker 0: I think it's 15.

110
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:53,767
Speaker 1: So definitely a lot less.

111
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:55,656
Speaker 0: It's a lot less than what steam takes.

112
00:05:56,078 --> 00:05:59,267
Speaker 0: so But here's the thing.

113
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:01,920
Speaker 0: so they announced we're gonna be exclusive on the epic store.

114
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,184
Speaker 0: So all the people pre-ordered on Steam are still gonna get the game on Steam and people are in a rush to pre-order on Steam today.

115
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:10,700
Speaker 0: so they get it on Steam so they don't have to use the epic store.

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,655
Speaker 1: But and physical copies will include steam keys.

117
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:15,459
Speaker 0: That's good to know.

118
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:19,740
Speaker 1: But anyway, I think that's just because they already printed them and it's too late - I think so, too.

119
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,860
Speaker 0: But if you want to get the game starting tomorrow digitally, you have to go to the epic store now.

120
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,382
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

121
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:31,100
Speaker 0: They're like, it seems like they made this deal right because They'll save a lot of money.

122
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,050
Speaker 0: They'll make more money if they sell it in the epic store.

123
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,678
Speaker 0: taking that epics taking less of a cut.

124
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,178
Speaker 0: but The thing is on the epic store.

125
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:40,874
Speaker 0: Game is $50 and on the steam store.

126
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:42,261
Speaker 0: It's $60.

127
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:47,956
Speaker 0: So per copy the developer is gonna make 50 extra cents per copy if they sell.

128
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:57,372
Speaker 0: if you buy in the epic store versus the steam store That's I guess that adds up if you have like thousands of sales But it only adds up to like hundreds or thousands of dollars.

129
00:06:57,412 --> 00:06:59,120
Speaker 0: It's not like a shit ton of money, right?

130
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:01,968
Speaker 1: Granted the margins in gaming are not great.

131
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:06,331
Speaker 0: No, it adds up, you know, whatever but I don't know how many sales Those games can expect.

132
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:06,959
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

133
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:13,440
Speaker 0: But it's like hey, well clearly this is a move that favors not the developer so much.

134
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,100
Speaker 0: But the epic store is doing this to try to get people to come over to the epic store.

135
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,815
Speaker 1: The thing is it's also the fact that they're still hedging their bets.

136
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:24,269
Speaker 1: It's a Time limited exclusive which is always like.

137
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:28,980
Speaker 1: I'm really really suspicious of time limited exclusives because it's not an exclusive.

138
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,224
Speaker 1: Anymore, it's just a delay.

139
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:37,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, like honestly, I would probably just wait a year And then buy the game on Steam directly.

140
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:44,580
Speaker 0: Yeah So most people are saying hey wait a year or two and get the complete redux gold game of the year edition for $7.

141
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:51,080
Speaker 0: And then the cut reply to that is on GOG where there's no DRM because this game is gonna have mad DRM, by the way

142
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,102
Speaker 1: Yep,

143
00:07:52,302 --> 00:08:00,520
Speaker 0: I was actually looking at Resident Evil 2 because that just the remake came out and it's supposed to be pretty sweet compared to Playing actual Resident Evil 2 which is tank controls and sucks to play.

144
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,033
Speaker 0: I was eyeing that but it has met it right on Steam.

145
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:05,619
Speaker 0: It says yo this shit has mad DRM.

146
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:09,459
Speaker 0: So what happens is usually after a while they remove the DRM.

147
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:13,017
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna wait for them to remove the DRM and then I'll play Resident Evil 2.

148
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:18,820
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, so Regarding that DRM, you know, we did our panel and we talked about retro games and we talked a lot about Bionic Commando.

149
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:22,490
Speaker 1: So I had this urge to play Bionic Commando Rearmed.

150
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:25,820
Speaker 1: I bought it on a store that hasn't existed for a long time.

151
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,007
Speaker 0: Oh, you didn't buy it on Steam?

152
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:29,320
Speaker 1: I bought it a long time ago like direct.

153
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:33,159
Speaker 1: Oh, no, uh, but I bought it in a place that didn't have DRM.

154
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,452
Speaker 1: So I just had an EXE that's still on my NAS that downloaded.

155
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:36,874
Speaker 1: It worked.

156
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have that's having me.

157
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:46,000
Speaker 0: I have a Blood Bowl the first Blood Bowl PC game Not the super old one the more right because the Blood Bowl 2 is out now has been out for I think years already.

158
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:50,560
Speaker 0: But I bought that in some weird-ass store that doesn't exist anymore, but I saved the EXE in the key.

159
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:53,378
Speaker 0: So theoretically I believe I could install and play it.

160
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:58,289
Speaker 1: So it's interesting because on one, you know, we've talked about this a lot But this issue is only gonna get bigger.

161
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:03,166
Speaker 1: on one hand as a consumer Not looking at any other considerations.

162
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:06,036
Speaker 1: I only want to go to one place to buy my games.

163
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:11,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is very It's inconvenient to have to have multiple accounts and multiple stores, right?

164
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,139
Speaker 1: It's like I get like I hate the oculus store my oculus store Literally my oculus account exists solely for me to launch Steam VR.

165
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:23,300
Speaker 0: It's not even really that I don't mind having more than one store, right?

166
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,994
Speaker 0: It's like going to different places to get the games is fine.

167
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,140
Speaker 1: I only want one launcher.

168
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:32,906
Speaker 0: I want only one user interface that lists all the games, you know It lists all my software to play.

169
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:40,200
Speaker 0: if that I wish people would still use say the start menu Then I wouldn't need to use a separate interface, but everyone's decided to make a separate interface.

170
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,740
Speaker 0: So it's like I have all these games I got for free in the twitch store.

171
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:52,720
Speaker 0: I have a bunch of GOG games But when I sit down in my computer to play games I open steam and all those games and the other interfaces don't get played because I don't think to look there, right?

172
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:56,713
Speaker 1: Well, I open steam and blizzard launcher specifically.

173
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:57,375
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

174
00:09:57,395 --> 00:10:01,261
Speaker 0: I have a blizzard battle net also Watch.

175
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,006
Speaker 1: it's literally just the overwatch launcher.

176
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:07,038
Speaker 0: compared to say on my iPhone or my iPad all the games are just icons.

177
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:07,840
Speaker 0: They're all together.

178
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:08,548
Speaker 0: I don't need to like.

179
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:16,793
Speaker 0: I have a separate, you know If I had to open the steam app to play games on my iPad I would have a steam icon and all those other games wouldn't get looked at.

180
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:18,840
Speaker 1: there are ways to make that work.

181
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:24,800
Speaker 0: All these stores could have made say APIs to their launchers that someone can make a universal game launcher.

182
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,380
Speaker 0: I would totally be willing to make a universal game launch.

183
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,666
Speaker 1: So there are a lot of ways.

184
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:28,807
Speaker 1: like.

185
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:31,660
Speaker 1: you can just have steam launch games that are just from the desktop.

186
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:32,650
Speaker 0: Oh, you could do that.

187
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:33,540
Speaker 0: It's a pain in the ass.

188
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,138
Speaker 1: You can make links that'll launch steam games from the desk.

189
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,046
Speaker 0: There's It sucks.

190
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:43,832
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is all those ways take a minimum amount of effort.

191
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:48,740
Speaker 1: that when I was younger I was willing to do in the same era when I was willing to customize the shit out of my desktop.

192
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:52,015
Speaker 0: But nowadays I guess I could write a script.

193
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:53,080
Speaker 0: maybe that does it right?

194
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:03,020
Speaker 0: I kind of semi automate like finds all your if it makes a folder in your start menu Finds all your steam games make icons for them finds all your games and all your others like GOG or just DRM free.

195
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:11,100
Speaker 0: So it would go to your GOG library get all the games Yeah, and they make a folder full of icons for all your games and then make a separate interface for searching that folder.

196
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:12,060
Speaker 0: That's full of shortcuts.

197
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:12,643
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

198
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:21,043
Speaker 1: if I'm looking universal game launch if I'm looking for a game to buy Kind of like when I just go to Amazon I just want to go to one place and type the name of the thing I'm looking for.

199
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:23,695
Speaker 0: it would be annoying to have to open like five stores though there.

200
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,940
Speaker 0: cuz someone could just make a website.

201
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,127
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are websites.

202
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:34,551
Speaker 0: this track the prices of games on all the stores I already don't care like and then you just you that would be your place would be that website Here's the and then you would go there and it would.

203
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,320
Speaker 1: there's the non-video game thing.

204
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Speaker 1: So what I want to watch the next episode of a show like some show or some movie.

205
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:46,995
Speaker 1: What I do is I log into Netflix That's the one that's just there and open on the HDPC and I type the name of the thing.

206
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:52,419
Speaker 1: if I if it doesn't show up there Maybe I go to Crunchyroll and type the name of the thing there.

207
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:53,327
Speaker 0: You know what I do.

208
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:57,370
Speaker 1: if it also doesn't show up there I type the name of the thing into Pirate Bay next.

209
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,960
Speaker 1: You know what I do even if I pay for it.

210
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:09,380
Speaker 0: I go I go to google.com and I say where can I stream X and I look at what it says And if it doesn't say one of the things I'm currently subscribed to I go to Pirate Bay.

211
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:13,093
Speaker 1: I'm not even willing to put the effort in to find out where it is first.

212
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:14,960
Speaker 1: I just type it into the streaming services.

213
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:16,067
Speaker 1: I'm already paying for.

214
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:18,020
Speaker 0: that's too much effort because then I go to go three places.

215
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,060
Speaker 0: I start by going to the Google search immediately.

216
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:23,720
Speaker 0: I just skip past step one, but maybe I have to do that for games now also.

217
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:33,926
Speaker 0: But the thing is if I have to do it for games right Streaming services when you pay for the streaming service you get everything on that service for free and you have this Pirate Bay Alternative for games.

218
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:37,460
Speaker 0: the Pirate Bay alternative is not the greatest like it is for say just a file.

219
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,352
Speaker 0: I'm a lot less willing to pirate a game because that's software.

220
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:48,960
Speaker 1: they could jack up my computer, so I only Pirate streaming media even if I'm like already paying for it on a service just because it's convenient.

221
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:51,109
Speaker 1: But with games piracy is not convenient at all.

222
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:51,812
Speaker 0: right exactly.

223
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:57,900
Speaker 0: and the thing is let's say I go to that website And I search where can I buy game X and it's available on five different games.

224
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,256
Speaker 0: It's available on GOG and steam and epic and ea origin or whatever in that case.

225
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:04,740
Speaker 1: I probably buy it on steam.

226
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,165
Speaker 0: It's cheaper on.

227
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:08,212
Speaker 0: you know about getting the epic one.

228
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:10,520
Speaker 0: I don't have an account on the epic store right now.

229
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:20,063
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go out Google make an account on the epic store just to buy one game and then Remember that to play that game have to open the epic store and not see I'm not motivated by price Just like online.

230
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:24,380
Speaker 0: this is why people are paying 10 extra dollars to get metro on steam things.

231
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,125
Speaker 0: You know it's 10 extra dollars.

232
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:31,440
Speaker 1: a lot of things I buy on Amazon cost more on Amazon than they would cost in a local store.

233
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:33,558
Speaker 1: I just don't want to go to a store.

234
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,933
Speaker 0: well You're getting an extra service with that which is exactly what the extra service here is.

235
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:39,639
Speaker 1: it's just in steam yep.

236
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:51,432
Speaker 0: So actually dad I guess though if you were starting today And you didn't already have a steam games going back to literally the day steam launched in 2004 or whatever then you could start with the epic store today.

237
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:52,195
Speaker 0: be fun right.

238
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,540
Speaker 1: so dazzle points out in the chat.

239
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,919
Speaker 1: It's actually a pretty good thing that we can mention here.

240
00:13:56,702 --> 00:14:02,480
Speaker 1: The advantage of having a game launcher is the integrated online features like chat community parties voice chat.

241
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:05,200
Speaker 1: I want to say I don't use any of that in steam.

242
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:07,376
Speaker 0: I don't use any of that, but you know what's really annoying you?

243
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:12,156
Speaker 1: that in Blizzard I don't know game launcher has anything better than just discord.

244
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,060
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

245
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:24,440
Speaker 0: It's super annoying that now when I open up a game There's like a steam overlay and a discord overlay And it's like it's like overlay central right with all these things piled up on top of a game.

246
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:25,919
Speaker 1: It's like if someone messaged me.

247
00:14:27,124 --> 00:14:29,860
Speaker 0: One at least at least the Microsoft one died and went away.

248
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I get used to be a Microsoft one my reaction is what why are you using steam to talk to me?

249
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,944
Speaker 0: I occasionally get steam messages.

250
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:38,249
Speaker 0: It's weird you get.

251
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:41,440
Speaker 0: I got steam and battle net and discord like all layered on top of each other.

252
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,465
Speaker 0: It's like no murder.

253
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:42,947
Speaker 0: all of these.

254
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,132
Speaker 0: there can be only one.

255
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:56,547
Speaker 1: like when I play overwatch either I use discord just because that's what I happen to have open or sometimes I've literally just like made a direct Google chat call to someone Because people abandon Federation.

256
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,433
Speaker 0: we should have gone full-on with the Federation.

257
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:00,540
Speaker 1: well because no one can make money in Federation.

258
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,383
Speaker 0: That's too damn bad.

259
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:03,752
Speaker 0: You're not making money with your battle net chat.

260
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:04,715
Speaker 0: That doesn't make you money.

261
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:06,020
Speaker 0: selling games makes you the money.

262
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,659
Speaker 0: Why do you even have the chat in there?

263
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:12,725
Speaker 1: So well so speaking of chat I have a brief geek bite.

264
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,316
Speaker 1: all right because I have been poking around in VR check.

265
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:18,820
Speaker 1: cuz I got VR play around with this Alright, so what is it?

266
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,948
Speaker 0: You just put the VR helmet on you walk around.

267
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,936
Speaker 0: what like a cyberspace like second life.

268
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:23,760
Speaker 0: and yes and chat.

269
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:25,366
Speaker 0: Yes, there's no games.

270
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:26,049
Speaker 0: There's no nothing.

271
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:26,249
Speaker 0: well.

272
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:28,699
Speaker 0: There are chatting there are games like what.

273
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:29,040
Speaker 1: so here?

274
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:36,372
Speaker 1: So here's the deal with VR based games like no No like full-on capture-the-flag fucking FPS.

275
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:36,773
Speaker 1: Let's go.

276
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:39,040
Speaker 1: It's just in there really in the world.

277
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,685
Speaker 0: You can just program games in it.

278
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can prove the deal with VR chat.

279
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:44,820
Speaker 0: That's pretty good is one?

280
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:46,092
Speaker 1: It's not the.

281
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:50,680
Speaker 1: its primary Function is that it is an SDK to make VR shit, okay?

282
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,504
Speaker 0: That is it?

283
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:52,758
Speaker 0: so it's like Gary's mod of VR.

284
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:57,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I'm playing CTF can I just like spawn like a bomb and I blow it up.

285
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:01,394
Speaker 0: and no Cuz you use the physics engine to send people flying.

286
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:02,400
Speaker 1: it depends on the room.

287
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:07,860
Speaker 0: So you can make a room That has whatever you want in it and then someone's the admin of the room and the other people can't mess with it.

288
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:17,080
Speaker 1: Basically, but people can make a mod like the mod of the IRC channel And people make avatars that do stuff and there's like yeah, my avatar is an enormous wall.

289
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:24,155
Speaker 0: Yep, so I spy I wait until my team moves the flag pattern and then I spawn.

290
00:16:24,336 --> 00:16:28,959
Speaker 1: so if someone's avatar is shitty You can block it from interacting with you and just walk through it.

291
00:16:29,562 --> 00:16:33,659
Speaker 0: Ah, oh, but then I can block walk through the person who's blocking me from capturing the flag.

292
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:38,626
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so block the entire enemy team so they can't block me Maybe.

293
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:40,119
Speaker 1: so it depends on how someone made the game.

294
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:44,960
Speaker 1: Anyway the deal with it is that it's also you can make your own avatars just import stuff.

295
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:47,036
Speaker 0: So it's a willing Gibson style cyberspace.

296
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:54,840
Speaker 1: Yes So oculus has it's like social nonsense through Facebook to like hang out in rooms with people steam has it like ever.

297
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:57,540
Speaker 1: Everyone has their hangout in VR space.

298
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,294
Speaker 1: So it's it's it's third life because you already had second and no one uses any of those things because they're hard to use and They suck and they're very gated.

299
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:04,980
Speaker 0: That's good.

300
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:09,980
Speaker 1: The reason VR Chad has exploded so big like it's big a lot of people are in there.

301
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,175
Speaker 1: How many people own VR headsets that are in so you can also enter it without a VR headset?

302
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:16,508
Speaker 1: Oh, that's why okay There's a desktop client just works.

303
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,623
Speaker 0: Oh, that's why everyone's in there and Picking.

304
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:27,138
Speaker 1: and so if you make an avatar give it whatever emojis you want or if you meet someone who has a cool avatar I guess if you're using VR you wouldn't see your own avatar?

305
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:30,199
Speaker 1: No, but you can look down and you see your body there.

306
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:31,524
Speaker 0: Guess you would.

307
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:33,696
Speaker 0: hey, yeah, and you can abuse in the desktop client.

308
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:35,486
Speaker 0: You're doing third-person You're not doing first person.

309
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,760
Speaker 1: Most people seem to do first person, but you can do third person.

310
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,054
Speaker 0: I would do third person with a desktop client first person via.

311
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:46,180
Speaker 1: so in VR The avatar will just move with you, but you can also program things like do a backflip or do a dance.

312
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:49,220
Speaker 0: So you can sort of tell if someone's VR and cuz they're moving differently.

313
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,562
Speaker 0: Yeah if people are VR guess I could like get a VR controller and not use the headset and then get the Right.

314
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:58,351
Speaker 0: get the realistic VR movements without.

315
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,560
Speaker 1: yeah, the problem is you'd need the head movement to make it all really feel.

316
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,697
Speaker 0: I could just get people use nerds for playing military FPS is use those head trackers.

317
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:08,209
Speaker 1: Yeah Sensors to make those work.

318
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:09,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a sensor thing you buy.

319
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:14,156
Speaker 1: If you're going to start an effort just wear the real VR headset at that point a little.

320
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,792
Speaker 0: it's a little weightier than Anyway, so all VR chats.

321
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:26,420
Speaker 1: India like this is the jankiest one But all of them the one thing they do really really really well, but the jankiest one is the most popular one.

322
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:29,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, is that the way the movement works?

323
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,956
Speaker 1: It's really immersive and you really feel like there's a real human being right there in the room with.

324
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:35,020
Speaker 0: it goes in the shell time.

325
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:35,397
Speaker 0: Let's go.

326
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:41,820
Speaker 1: So the deal with VR chat is that all the other things are like make this space and like invite people to the space.

327
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,165
Speaker 1: It's just fucking anarchy.

328
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,000
Speaker 1: in VR chat you walk into a hub and there's just people on and around.

329
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:47,967
Speaker 0: That's how it's supposed to be.

330
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:49,840
Speaker 1: you can be like wander to a random world.

331
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,487
Speaker 0: That's the cyberpunk vision in a world.

332
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:54,038
Speaker 1: You can drop a portal to another world and be like everybody.

333
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:54,941
Speaker 1: follow me Is there?

334
00:18:54,962 --> 00:18:56,789
Speaker 0: how do you get a list of worlds slash list?

335
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:58,054
Speaker 0: There is sort of.

336
00:18:58,657 --> 00:19:01,446
Speaker 1: there's just a list But it's so long you could never like.

337
00:19:01,547 --> 00:19:02,831
Speaker 0: you can search it though.

338
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:04,115
Speaker 0: Barely barely.

339
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,620
Speaker 1: You got to just fucking explore.

340
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:09,900
Speaker 1: So you browse yeah or find a friend or go to a world meet someone cool.

341
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,140
Speaker 0: Can you know if you're in a world?

342
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:11,963
Speaker 0: Can I just can I?

343
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:14,515
Speaker 0: is there an easy way to teleport like go where rim is?

344
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:15,218
Speaker 0: Cuz you're my friend.

345
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,288
Speaker 0: Yes Okay, that's or you're in a world.

Speaker 1: You follow me.

349
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:22,660
Speaker 1: you can drop a portal and you jump through it.

350
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,059
Speaker 0: Oh, everyone physically walks through the portal in the game.

351
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,683
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they want to I choose a world and I make a portal and now people can walk into it and I'll go to Same place together.

352
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:30,944
Speaker 0: Yep.

353

354
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:43,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you kids really easy to get your friends together, okay And some of the what it's really hard to like find a specific world if you don't know the name.

355
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:45,673
Speaker 1: Same thing with avatars.

356
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:46,420
Speaker 1: you want an avatar.

357
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:50,707
Speaker 1: You can dig through menu But it really the way to find an avatar.

358
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:53,257
Speaker 1: if someone has a cool avatar just steal it from them.

359
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:54,000
Speaker 0: now your website.

360
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,267
Speaker 0: I can just search for an avatar.

361
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:55,730
Speaker 0: No click.

362
00:19:56,051 --> 00:20:05,760
Speaker 1: so you can go to an avatar world Thousands and thousands of them and find an avatar world that it's like the the Pokemon avatar world.

363
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,196
Speaker 1: I went in there and someone just made avatars of every goddamn Pokemon every single one.

364
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:11,220
Speaker 0: Yes, there is Spiritomb.

365

00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,280
Speaker 1: I was a Spiritomb.

368
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,204
Speaker 1: I was wandering around.

369
00:20:16,244 --> 00:20:16,988
Speaker 0: that's I want to be.

370
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:18,756
Speaker 0: so I wanted to be a Spiritomb and walk around.

371
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:19,620
Speaker 1: Here are the avatars.

372
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,603
Speaker 0: That's what I want to do.

373
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:22,008
Speaker 1: Here are the avatars.

374
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:24,837
Speaker 1: I like borrowed and rims avatars.

375
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:26,625
Speaker 0: dragon furry Not yet.

376
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:31,272
Speaker 0: No Something with some sort of tour so of some kind.

377
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:32,998
Speaker 1: so here's what I have in order.

378
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:41,787
Speaker 1: one Unity-chan, which is this cute anime girl because that's because that's the only default avatar that isn't ugly as shit Okay, and also it's cute.

379
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:42,952
Speaker 0: Whatever what else would remake?

380
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:45,763
Speaker 0: my second avatar was Bulbasaur And then Spiritomb.

381
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:46,446
Speaker 0: That's a rim thing.

382
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:49,257
Speaker 1: Then the Hachiroku full-scale.

383
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:49,980
Speaker 0: Just a Hachiroku.

384
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,682
Speaker 0: Yeah, is it?

385
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:55,275
Speaker 0: is it like on its hind wheels standing up or is it just driving?

386
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,858
Speaker 1: Just a car like flap the headlamps open and close.

387
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,008
Speaker 1: It is it's just anarchy in there.

388
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,757
Speaker 0: All right, so it sounds like my kind of place.

389
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:10,034
Speaker 1: it is worth Poke it around in its race gets totally free.

390
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:11,340
Speaker 0: I'm going to get the desktop when I go.

391
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:12,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

392
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:15,293
Speaker 0: It's just can't make a geek nights world geek nights world.

393
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:16,437
Speaker 1: I think we should.

394
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:17,460
Speaker 0: what's in the geek nights world?

395
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:18,547
Speaker 1: So here are the.

396
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,420
Speaker 1: before we move on my last bit of the geek bite.

397
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:27,640
Speaker 0: Here are the places I ran into broadcast every night's episode in VR chat and could make a stage with a desk.

398
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:34,884
Speaker 0: I went into a world that was and then it'll be a screen that shows the YouTube stream on it and then they'll be Some people can sit.

399
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:37,834
Speaker 0: I went into a back of the back of this.

400
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:39,560
Speaker 0: seats will be a dig-dug machine.

401
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:43,140
Speaker 1: I went to do a world that was called running in the 90s and it is the song.

402
00:21:45,961 --> 00:22:00,040
Speaker 1: It's that song running in a loop and it's basically like Part of Mount Akina and everyone was just dressed as initial D cars Except a bunch of people who were dressed as Pokemon and they were just arguing about random internet shit hanging out.

403
00:22:00,762 --> 00:22:05,118
Speaker 0: I would I would be dude and I would stand on the side behind the guardrail and pump my fist.

404
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:08,340
Speaker 1: Yeah So then I went to a world that was called karaoke world.

405
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:13,000
Speaker 1: It was just a bunch of people legit singing karaoke and taking turns so you can use microphone action.

406
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:13,985
Speaker 1: It just works.

407
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,572
Speaker 0: But what if you're in a room with a lot of people?

408
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:16,115
Speaker 0: How does that work?

409
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:17,220
Speaker 1: audio proximity?

410
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,069
Speaker 0: The closer you actually have that program.

411
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:19,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's good.

412
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:26,060
Speaker 1: It's it's Just what if I yell real loud if you annoy people.

413
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:34,316
Speaker 1: So the one thing that really but the reason I'm talking about VR chat is because This is this is a place that is rife for like 4chan style abuse.

414
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:40,814
Speaker 1: Yeah it Anti harassment features are first and foremost really by default.

415
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:46,661
Speaker 1: your shield level is to two people You haven't friended meaning their avatars can't do crazy shit Like.

416
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:50,355
Speaker 1: they can't spawn particle effects that you would see they can't be too big.

417
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:56,336
Speaker 1: They can't play audio They can only talk and it is real trivial to block someone.

418
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:59,271
Speaker 1: they just disappear You just don't see him anymore.

419
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,736
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Was there a Nazi Channel?

420
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,835
Speaker 1: I assume there is in there somewhere, but I did not encounter any Nazis.

421
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:07,920
Speaker 0: It's not just like deleted.

422
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,587
Speaker 1: So here's the trolling I encountered.

423
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:10,088
Speaker 0: Are there any?

424
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,735
Speaker 0: are there any sexy sexy channels?

425
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:13,000
Speaker 1: Yes, there's a million of them.

426
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,971
Speaker 1: Good fucking God.

427
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:17,186
Speaker 0: All right Which one are we going to be?

428
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:19,032
Speaker 1: as NSFW as you wants?

429
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:21,260
Speaker 1: you can't bring that shit into a public channel.

430
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:25,052
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, you can have the boobiest avatar you want.

431
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:26,818
Speaker 0: But how do I get into the private channel?

432
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:27,380
Speaker 1: find it?

433
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,494
Speaker 0: I need a password or know what you need to know the name private world.

434
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:32,323
Speaker 1: get invited to it by a friend I don't know.

435
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,234
Speaker 1: meet somebody and they password it.

436
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:35,120
Speaker 0: or can I just click on one?

437
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:36,627
Speaker 1: Uh, I guess just click on it.

438
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:37,672
Speaker 1: meet some dude in a shady.

439
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:39,140
Speaker 1: I was like, hey kid, you want some goofballs?

Speaker 0: I could roleplay as you Ray I got dude.

442
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:43,824
Speaker 1: So here's the trend.

443
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:45,452
Speaker 0: I can hand out invites to the porn channel.

444
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:46,496
Speaker 1: I turned shields down.

445
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:47,200
Speaker 1: I went to a room.

446
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:51,240
Speaker 1: I was hanging out and this kid is just like hey everybody follow me and he drops a portal.

447
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,528
Speaker 1: I'm like, all right.

448
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:53,473
Speaker 1: I got my shields down.

449
00:23:53,735 --> 00:23:54,500
Speaker 1: I go into the portal.

450
00:23:55,361 --> 00:24:02,919
Speaker 1: it's just this black world where you're falling to the void forever and then his avatar was like this Thousand-foot Godzilla that starts screaming.

451
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:06,347
Speaker 1: It almost made me sick.

452
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:08,176
Speaker 1: I had to like jump out of the room in a hurry.

453
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:09,000
Speaker 0: Oh cuz you're a VR.

454
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:13,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was mean I was falling through Desktop, that would just be hilarious.

455
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:19,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was still hilarious because I don't get VR sick, but We'll talk about VR chat in the future.

456
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:23,020
Speaker 1: But it this is where post-millennials are hanging out.

457
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,740
Speaker 1: This is like the place that people are just socializing on the internet only cyberpunk place.

458
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:31,160
Speaker 0: Well, that's great, but I'm still not buying some oculus headset.

459
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:36,400
Speaker 1: No, so it also works with oculus go which is the light headset that doesn't need sensors and doesn't need a computer.

460
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,470
Speaker 0: That is vastly superior, but still too big.

461
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:38,993
Speaker 0: I've seen it.

462
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:40,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty good.

463
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:42,467
Speaker 1: So one last gaming news.

464
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:44,996
Speaker 1: really briefly that took longer than I expected.

465
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:49,060
Speaker 1: if you didn't notice There was a sports ball game a football game, right?

466
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,840
Speaker 0: So that basically here's the deal in the NFC championship game Which is a game that they play and the winner goes to the Super Bowl.

467
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,886
Speaker 1: That's a big deal game.

468
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:58,299
Speaker 0: It happened two weeks ago because the Super Bowl is this weekend.

469
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:05,464
Speaker 0: The winner of the game likely won because the ref did not make a call They should have made.

470
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,999
Speaker 0: had the ref made the call the other team probably would have won.

471
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,038
Speaker 0: Therefore the legitimacy of the Super Bowl is in question.

472
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,069
Speaker 0: now It should be a different team in the Super Bowl this weekend.

473
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:20,260
Speaker 1: in a lot of Lee in a lot of other big major sports There are more games and fewer opportunities.

474
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:24,596
Speaker 1: Yes one bad call in one game base literally determine who gets the Stanley Cup baseball.

475
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:27,700
Speaker 0: the National League Championship Series is four out of seven.

476
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:34,663
Speaker 0: So if there's a no call in one of the games and you still lose the series say five one Guess what?

477
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:38,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't really complain but football with it for four.

478
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,829
Speaker 1: I mean for one American football for a variety of reasons.

479
00:25:42,371 --> 00:25:44,960
Speaker 1: one bad call literally could determine it goes to the Super Bowl.

480
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:53,280
Speaker 0: now They do have lots of rules for replay and challenging But they are not extensive enough as that you could run out of challenges or in this case There was a no call.

481
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:53,883
Speaker 0: So it's like.

482
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:55,590
Speaker 0: you're not allowed to like you challenge.

483
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,365
Speaker 0: if like you think the ref like, you know Didn't made a wrong call.

484
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,452
Speaker 0: not if they just didn't call something.

485
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:02,495
Speaker 0: There's nothing to challenge.

486
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:06,760
Speaker 1: Yep, right like in hockey You can't just be like hey that was sparing and you didn't see it.

487
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,893
Speaker 1: They might find the guy after the game, but it's highly unlikely.

488
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:13,440
Speaker 1: They're gonna back up and say, okay There's a two-minute minor from five minutes ago.

489
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:16,637
Speaker 0: There's also a lot of hypocrisy on the part of the NHL.

490
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:24,599
Speaker 0: for example There was a guy who committed a hit to the head right and got a fine after the game But in the game, it was not penalized.

491
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:29,200
Speaker 0: So so they missed that call, but they sought to rectify it after the game.

492
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,939
Speaker 0: But here they miss a call that actually affects the result of the game.

493
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,042
Speaker 0: They don't rectify it.

494
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:36,872
Speaker 0: also to add to the arrogance of the the NFL right.

495
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:40,220
Speaker 0: the commissioner hasn't even made a comment on it.

496
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,233
Speaker 0: He's not going to make a comment until the Super Bowl press conference.

497
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:48,456
Speaker 0: No, he's basically just ignoring it Like I don't have to do to you, you know, please I ignore.

498
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:54,400
Speaker 0: I ignore I feel like he'll get away with it in the right, but the the basically regardless the the consequence is unavoidable.

499
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:59,033
Speaker 0: Is that the integrity and credibility of the league has taken a lot of damage?

500
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:03,603
Speaker 1: So here's the news attorney Frank DiMaggio D'Amico.

501
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:06,253
Speaker 0: that sounds like the name of an attorney like Vinny.

502
00:27:06,474 --> 00:27:12,920
Speaker 1: Vinny someone right so Says he has filed a civil suit in New Orleans on behalf of Saints season ticket holders.

503
00:27:13,502 --> 00:27:16,090
Speaker 0: That's the wrong person to file on suit behalf of yep.

504
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:17,936
Speaker 0: So legally I think he's got nothing.

505
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,465
Speaker 0: so not not a lawyer But I feel like he's got nothing.

506
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:24,000
Speaker 1: So there is a lawsuit that is actually moving.

507
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:27,096
Speaker 1: The lawsuit has now been moved to federal court.

508
00:27:27,237 --> 00:27:30,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Think it'll be dismissed or won't win.

509
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,705
Speaker 0: Yeah NFL lawyers.

510
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:39,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I don't because going up against NFL lawyers your rich season ticket holders But you're up against NFL on one hand.

511
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, the like a bad call was made.

512
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:49,300
Speaker 1: and yeah, because this is a big-money sport There are real-world consequences for players not for fans.

513
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:56,015
Speaker 0: The only consequence that they have gambled yep the industry the city.

514
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:57,358
Speaker 0: well one's gambling is legal.

515
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:04,600
Speaker 0: suddenly then Real that the bookie can sue and they have a case but the team that might not go to this is out.

516
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:08,253
Speaker 0: The gambler has a small case, but the bookie has a big case.

517
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:10,040
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of money involved.

518
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:12,371
Speaker 0: So season ticket holder has a small case.

519
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:17,300
Speaker 0: There's like oh you got denied Super Bowl tickets But you know what denied the right to scalp Super Bowl tickets, right?

520
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:22,916
Speaker 0: But the if the team sued which they won't but they could then the players could sue.

521
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,287
Speaker 0: they have a bigger case But they're not suing.

522
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:26,234
Speaker 0: They're just complaining.

523
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:35,655
Speaker 1: So I am 100% unsympathetic to the fans like don't especially yeah Because the sports ball game didn't go the way you want it, even though that sucks.

524
00:28:35,796 --> 00:28:38,844
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in Terms of the rest of it.

525
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:40,169
Speaker 1: There are real-world consequences.

526
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:43,140
Speaker 1: So you could almost see where like where a lawsuit like this go ahead.

527
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:46,080
Speaker 0: I don't want sports gambling to be legal actually, but you know what?

528
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,000
Speaker 0: I say make it legal just so I want to see the bookies sue the leagues for fucking up.

529
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, but here's the other thing.

530
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:54,172
Speaker 1: It's the NFL.

531
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,377
Speaker 1: They can do whatever the fuck they want.

532
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:56,220
Speaker 0: Yeah legally.

533
00:28:56,342 --> 00:29:05,766
Speaker 1: They probably got a contract League and Commissioner rim and Commissioner Scott say you know what this team wins because I don't like your hat There's actually people were claimed.

534
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:11,911
Speaker 0: There is a clause actually in the NFL whatever Whatever, you know, I guess it has a charter.

535
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:17,769
Speaker 0: I don't know a lot about the NFL Charter Some kind of document because NFL is a nonprofit right itself.

536
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:20,717
Speaker 0: Just the individual teams are for profit, right?

537
00:29:20,737 --> 00:29:28,109
Speaker 0: But anyway the the oh the Commissioner can actually just Unilaterally change the result of a game.

538
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:31,605
Speaker 0: the Commissioner could have said, you know what Saints win Don't is never.

539
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:34,120
Speaker 0: I don't think he's ever done it and he didn't do it in this case.

540
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,705
Speaker 1: So I'm also pretty confident.

541
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:42,292
Speaker 1: all the contracts within the NFL probably together have clauses that effectively say The NFL can do whatever the fuck it wants.

542
00:29:42,493 --> 00:29:43,480
Speaker 0: I'm also curious.

543
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:45,005
Speaker 0: Conspiracy time.

544
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:46,229
Speaker 0: the Ellie.

545
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:52,729
Speaker 0: the LA Rams who recently moved to LA from st Louis are the team that beat the Saints because of the no-call.

546
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,553
Speaker 0: was the fix-in?

547
00:29:54,814 --> 00:29:57,200
Speaker 0: because LA is a bigger market than New Orleans.

548
00:29:57,942 --> 00:29:58,464
Speaker 1: You know what?

549
00:29:58,785 --> 00:29:59,547
Speaker 1: I bet there's.

550
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:01,915
Speaker 1: no I bet they could do that if they wanted to.

551
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:02,758
Speaker 0: was the fix-in?

552
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:04,441
Speaker 1: I Doubt it.

553
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:10,075
Speaker 0: if the no-call had been the other way would they have done something to put the Rams in the Super Bowl over the Saints?

554
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:14,658
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember a time where the Red Wings are on the way to get a Stanley Cup and they were sweeping people.

555
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:17,488
Speaker 1: and Then in the Stanley Cup Finals, it was or was?

556
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,033
Speaker 1: it was the semi-finals the finals.

557
00:30:19,314 --> 00:30:22,522
Speaker 1: They won three games in a row Ridiculously.

558
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:25,239
Speaker 1: the fourth game was away and then the fifth game would have been at home.

559
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:34,048
Speaker 1: They lost that away game after winning three ridiculous games in a row just by a little bit And then they crushed in the home game.

560
00:30:34,731 --> 00:30:36,619
Speaker 1: So did they just try to bring the cup home?

561
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:49,800
Speaker 0: Maybe yeah, I just want to say though There really is that all sports all professional sports are not using replay technology Effectively enough or creatively enough, right?

562
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,120
Speaker 1: I think the enemy the NHL is pushed it way further than other sports, right?

563
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:04,593
Speaker 0: But what I'm saying you could do that no one does is have separate people watching basically every part of a game On video right the whole time.

564
00:31:04,674 --> 00:31:08,107
Speaker 0: not you don't even rest on the ice They're asking the ice can be looking out for the basic stuff, right?

565
00:31:08,187 --> 00:31:11,940
Speaker 0: Yep, and call things just as the game is going on, right?

566
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:16,127
Speaker 0: All rules in real time.

567
00:31:16,147 --> 00:31:19,440
Speaker 1: so it's got have one lot one like linesman version two.

568
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,420
Speaker 1: We'll call him a. screens min one screens min per player.

569
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:25,132
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they just watch each player and be like up he hooks.

570
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:25,734
Speaker 1: Yep.

571
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:27,563
Speaker 0: He got hooked exactly Why not?

572
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:30,440
Speaker 0: and then in real time they could just call right you don't even to stop play.

573
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,039
Speaker 0: You can just be like put that guy in the box.

574
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,925
Speaker 0: You open up the box.

575
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:33,650
Speaker 0: people are still playing.

576
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:37,700
Speaker 0: he skates over to the box gets in Especially for a game like soccer where they don't even stop the clock.

577
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:46,140
Speaker 0: Yeah You can just have guys watching every all 22 soccer players cuz it's 11 on 11 right all the time and call everything perfectly perfectly.

578
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,200
Speaker 1: Yellow cards just start falling.

579
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:56,420
Speaker 0: Just have people watching every second of every game, especially, you know doing that to great lengths for just a regular season game.

580
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,228
Speaker 0: Alright, maybe that's too far.

581
00:31:58,309 --> 00:31:59,273
Speaker 0: Maybe it cost too much.

582
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:00,640
Speaker 0: Maybe it's too resource intensive.

583
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:02,360
Speaker 0: You guys have a couple people doing it.

584
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:10,997
Speaker 0: Just look a little bit more closely, but for the NFC championship game and the Super Bowl and the World Cup Why would you not do this?

585
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:18,320
Speaker 1: Yep I mean, there's a reason why for important hockey games Toronto is reviewing every goal regardless of the situation what I'm saying.

586
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:21,231
Speaker 1: So yeah, this will be funny to follow.

587
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:30,108
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's time for Things of the day.

588
00:32:30,128 --> 00:32:36,399
Speaker 1: I am finally disposed toward randomizers But I haven't watched a lot too deeply until now.

589
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:41,660
Speaker 1: Holy crap this Final Fantasy 4 free enterprise randomizer.

590
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,450
Speaker 1: It was way better than I thought it was gonna be.

591
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:47,957
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play this randomizer.

592
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:49,423
Speaker 0: Holy crap I watched.

593
00:32:49,443 --> 00:32:50,551
Speaker 0: part of that speedrun is pretty good.

594
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:52,101
Speaker 1: This is from AGDQ 2019.

595
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:57,480
Speaker 1: It's a four-way race in Final Fantasy 4 where everything's randomized and they're all playing the same seed.

596
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,468
Speaker 1: It's pretty intense and the commentary is A+.

597
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:04,960
Speaker 0: if you're wondering how the hell do you randomize a JRPG watch this speedrun.

598
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:07,640
Speaker 1: They explain it and like you watch you're like wait a minute.

599
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:13,120
Speaker 1: There haven't been any random encounters and as soon as you think that the commentators like so you might have noticed there's no random encounters.

600
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:15,882
Speaker 1: well They can.

601
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:18,853
Speaker 1: the players can turn on random encounters if and when they choose.

602
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,121
Speaker 1: if they want to level something up I need that It's.

603
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:22,226
Speaker 1: I'm playing this.

604
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,010
Speaker 1: I'm playing this.

605
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,693
Speaker 1: This looks good.

606
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:25,320
Speaker 0: Anyway, should we do a geek nights race?

607
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:26,308
Speaker 1: The problem is no 40 hours.

608
00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:31,329
Speaker 0: No Anyway, so speaking of football.

609
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,514
Speaker 0: Here's a great thing of the day.

610
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:34,260
Speaker 1: Oh, this is so good ESPN.

611
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:39,480
Speaker 0: What they did is they went on Twitter and they saw this during college football.

612
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:44,340
Speaker 0: You know where people are not as professional and not as good at playing as professional football.

613
00:33:45,162 --> 00:33:46,206
Speaker 0: When kickers missed.

614
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:49,196
Speaker 0: they would see fans of the team tweeting things like.

615
00:33:49,276 --> 00:34:00,288
Speaker 0: I could have made that you bum The kind of thing that I would say like I you know Right yelling at the team stuff that we in the old days and in the current days We would just yell at the TV.

616
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:03,240
Speaker 0: people were typing their yell at the TV things on Twitter.

617
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:07,100
Speaker 1: I have in fact yelled the words I could have made that shot in hockey.

618
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:13,795
Speaker 0: I only say it on the rare occasion But I know it's like when it's like empty net and he's five feet away and they still miss.

619
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:16,527
Speaker 1: but the thing is I Say that in the privacy of my own home.

620
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:19,443
Speaker 1: I don't say it to the person who missed the shot Definitely not.

621
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:23,460
Speaker 0: But anyway, there are people on Twitter who are tweeting like at college kicker her.

622
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:27,460
Speaker 0: I could have made that you bum that kids got homework, right?

623
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:28,926
Speaker 0: He's got a finish.

624
00:34:28,946 --> 00:34:31,099
Speaker 0: that guy's not going to the NFL probably but anyway.

625
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:37,255
Speaker 0: So they called these Pete the contact of these people and they're ESPN.

626
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,350
Speaker 0: they're like, hey, we're ESPN We're gonna give you money right.

627
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,300
Speaker 0: come and fly out to be on a TV show.

628
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,429
Speaker 0: You see you're a football fan of this college team.

629
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,196
Speaker 0: You seem like a real passionate fan.

630
00:34:46,257 --> 00:34:47,040
Speaker 1: It sounds like a trap.

631
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:48,553
Speaker 0: We're gonna make a video thing.

632
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:49,239
Speaker 0: Come on out.

633
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,563
Speaker 0: Well, we can't tell you what it is.

634
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:56,306
Speaker 0: It's a prize, but it's it's a thing related to your extreme fandom of this college Football team right?

635
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:56,949
Speaker 0: It's ESPN.

636
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,797
Speaker 0: You're gonna be on TV or on YouTube or whatever.

637
00:34:58,857 --> 00:34:59,239
Speaker 0: Come on out.

638
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:09,980
Speaker 0: So the people in exchange probably for money came on out and they brought him out onto this indoor Field area and they showed them their tweet like I could have kicked that you bum.

639
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:17,282
Speaker 0: And then they're like, alright, go ahead It was what that kick that they missed in that 31 yard line was a 31 yard kick All right.

640
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:17,704
Speaker 0: Here you go.

641
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:18,951
Speaker 0: Make this 31 yard kick.

642
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,560
Speaker 0: Look there isn't even anyone in the field.

643
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:24,912
Speaker 0: It's gonna be even easier than the actual college kicker had to deal with.

644
00:35:24,932 --> 00:35:28,947
Speaker 0: you're just in this no wind right indoors No one rushing at you.

645
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:32,967
Speaker 0: You got all the time in the world and everyone Failed spectacularly.

646
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:39,212
Speaker 1: they kicked about as well as I would yep The woman being like doing the the the shake with them.

647
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:40,416
Speaker 0: She's like holding in her laughter.

648
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:41,500
Speaker 1: Her face is great.

649
00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:43,209
Speaker 1: She is she is.

650
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,619
Speaker 1: she is also a plus in this.

651
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,233
Speaker 0: But yeah, maybe you know watching this gives you that sort of like.

652
00:35:48,254 --> 00:35:49,880
Speaker 0: haha you you you jerks.

653
00:35:50,121 --> 00:35:55,220
Speaker 0: But it also gives you that respect for the people who actually kick the football to the field goal.

654
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,386
Speaker 0: Like yeah, it's fucking hard.

655
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,160
Speaker 1: Like yeah a 30-yard field goal is relatively easy.

656
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,393
Speaker 0: It's like it's routine for NFL dudes to kick like 40 50-yard field goals.

657
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:05,460
Speaker 0: They're supposed to make those burning wheel.

658
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,850
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, you can't kick a 10-yard field goal.

659
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,733
Speaker 0: Look at holy shit.

660
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:10,420
Speaker 0: That person's gonna keep it like burning wheel.

661
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:12,626
Speaker 1: It's a it's an OBS three or four.

662
00:36:12,747 --> 00:36:14,151
Speaker 1: They just have a b7.

663
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:17,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like he's like he's like g7 and kicking.

664
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,775
Speaker 0: That's why I think right but the college people don't.

665
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:20,137
Speaker 0: they're like b5.

666
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,603
Speaker 1: And I think g7 was that guy who was missing the front half of his foot and had that special shoe that basically turned his Foot into a hammer.

667
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:32,264
Speaker 0: He wasn't as good as current day control, but in his era because it was different in his era He was unbelievable.

668
00:36:32,304 --> 00:36:35,097
Speaker 1: But you know in the meta moment the book club book is the 2001 space.

669
00:36:36,524 --> 00:36:37,531
Speaker 0: I guess I should read bugs.

670
00:36:37,692 --> 00:36:38,639
Speaker 1: I will read it soon.

671
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:44,907
Speaker 0: Coming up this is approaching like the longest not read Book for the book one.

672
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:48,900
Speaker 1: We've been busy - there's been a lot of quality television that I've been watching.

673
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,565
Speaker 0: It's not too much television.

674
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:55,140
Speaker 0: But finally there is a large gap here between now and PAX East where I don't have many plans.

675
00:36:55,241 --> 00:37:00,609
Speaker 1: I will say there is a TV show on regular fucking TV.

676
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,736
Speaker 1: That is actually good.

677
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:05,538
Speaker 0: Yeah the good place Everyone keeps talking about I don't care.

678
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:15,366
Speaker 1: so the all also the deal all those I got a deal is it's a show that acts like the kind of crap someone to watch on TV and then it actually just teaches Them moral philosophy like for real.

679
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:17,131
Speaker 0: I already know moral philosophy though.

680
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:19,960
Speaker 0: Do you really I mean, I know my moral philosophy?

681
00:37:20,202 --> 00:37:25,814
Speaker 1: Well, but I don't need to know anyone else's It addresses the trolley problem in the correct way.

682
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:26,437
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

683
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:29,447
Speaker 1: So Anyway, we'll do that book at some point.

684
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:32,220
Speaker 1: We put two videos on YouTube.

685
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,953
Speaker 1: So if you want to see our pre-judging of all the anime, they're out.

686
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,120
Speaker 1: now it is on Scott's YouTube channel.

687
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:40,708
Speaker 0: I was watching a Dororo.

688
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:41,631
Speaker 1: I was too.

689
00:37:41,832 --> 00:37:44,300
Speaker 0: I think there's a newer episode I can maybe watch.

690
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,739
Speaker 0: I don't know when new episodes come out, but I'm sure there's one I haven't seen.

691
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:50,500
Speaker 1: now I think Dororo is good enough to where I'm just gonna watch the whole thing and we can review.

692
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,302
Speaker 0: I read the whole manga and so far it's the same but without the Tezuka silliness I did.

693
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,557
Speaker 0: we will do a Wednesday episode on it soon.

694
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:57,019

699
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,599
Speaker 1: people seem to like it.

700
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:30,500
Speaker 1: The first one of the comments on the panel after we put it up was literally please come back to Kineticon.

701
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:34,977
Speaker 1: Another one was when will you make the next do ten a chapter?

702
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,540
Speaker 1: Both of those may happen in the nearing future.

703
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,449
Speaker 1: I don't know if Scott will go to Kineticon, but I will.

704
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,600
Speaker 0: hopefully depends on the circumstances.

705
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,620
Speaker 1: I'm probably gonna only go for like Saturday and having the thing is Kineticon doesn't sell out, right?

706
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't have to decide till right before.

713
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:14,277

714
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:15,080
Speaker 0: anyway

715
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:18,210
Speaker 1: Beyond that look for our stuff on the internet.

716
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:27,945
Speaker 1: It's time to talk about not good critters Which we also played but La Cosa Nostra all right a 2014 board game that is Relatively new to us.

717
00:39:28,106 --> 00:39:29,290

Speaker 0: I played it one time.

719
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:31,699
Speaker 1: then we got Scott to play it.

720
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:32,825

721
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:40,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got a friend who really likes mafia themed games and I like mafia thing, but I don't really like mafia things right.

722
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,000
Speaker 0: I just I regular like mafia things hiding in the stove.

723
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:55,296
Speaker 0: But yeah, so this game the way the fundamental concept is that you're a mob boss And there are other mob bosses, and you got people in your mob because that's what a mob is.

724
00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:59,419
Speaker 0: you get some drug dealers You got some fences you got some I don't know.

Speaker 0: Everyone else is bad dudes working for them, too.

731
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:27,120
Speaker 0: You can hire more dudes with money sure But you got jobs you need to do to get money and each job requires a set of dudes.

732
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, so in order to do this job.

733
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:32,589

00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:37,968
Speaker 0: hey rim Can I have your pimp?

737
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,136
Speaker 0: I need his help to do some work.

738
00:40:40,557 --> 00:40:42,827
Speaker 0: Hey Joe Can I borrow your night?

739
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:45,839
Speaker 1: your your drug dealer and my response might be?

740
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:56,996
Speaker 1: Yes, Scott you can use my pimp at some point in the future if you will let me at an undetermined point use your loan Shark yep, but my response might also be you know what fuck you in fact?

741
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:58,041
Speaker 1: give me $4,000.

742
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,400
Speaker 1: I'm gonna kill all the other pimps on the table.

743
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:06,480
Speaker 0: Use my nightclub, but I understand that you were using my nightclub for a very lucrative party.

744
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,960
Speaker 0: You will have to give me half the revenues of the party that occurs in my nightclub.

745
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:15,364
Speaker 1: How about how about I'll just give you six grand cash Right now?

746
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:20,102
Speaker 0: that tells me that the party you are going to do in my nightclub is going to make you more than $12,000.

747
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,790
Speaker 0: so now I want even more.

748
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:25,519
Speaker 1: yep, so we say we make our deal, and we're like our deals.

749
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,854
Speaker 1: fine We're both gonna make a lot of money, then it's our friends.

750
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:28,680
Speaker 1: You're Joe Joe's turn.

751
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,945
Speaker 1: He's like rim and Scott.

752
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:33,280
Speaker 1: you both have to give me five grand or I'm fucking killing Scott's pimp right now.

753
00:41:33,582 --> 00:41:37,396
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can kill people yep and then the job won't happen.

754
00:41:37,457 --> 00:41:42,700
Speaker 1: and The game is pretty like we're not gonna go through the rules because the game is actually pretty complex.

755
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,490
Speaker 1: There's a lot of phases, but it's not complex to play.

756
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:51,168
Speaker 1: the complexity just makes the game work because Everything happens.

757
00:41:51,188 --> 00:41:59,959
Speaker 1: you just keep going clockwise Sequentially and first you're taking your mobsters and some of them are smart and some of them are kind of shitty Yeah, and they make money for you.

758
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:03,795
Speaker 1: Yeah So you got some mobsters and every turn it comes to your turn all your.

759
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:15,279
Speaker 1: every round it comes to your turn and all you Is you put a mobster down and you say Smiley two-face is doing this job, and you put the mobster face up and the job face down mm-hmm.

760
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:16,620
Speaker 1: And then it goes around again.

761
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,790
Speaker 1: You say Tommy two toes is doing this other job.

762
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:22,940
Speaker 0: you put the job face down and some of them are better than others.

763
00:42:23,662 --> 00:42:26,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, so one job might be like wreck somebody.

764
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:32,048
Speaker 0: so the job of the like five gun strength super mobster Right the guy in the white suit.

765
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:33,919
Speaker 0: He's doing the most important job.

766
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:39,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the job that the one gun guy is doing is probably like some lame-o job.

767
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:47,099
Speaker 1: Some of the jobs are public like I might put Joey Jojo Shabbat ooh down is one gun mobster and be like he's just buying that nightclub.

768
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:50,613
Speaker 0: legit He's buying this for I sent him out to go buy a nightclub.

769
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:51,295
Speaker 0: That's all he's doing.

770
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:51,777
Speaker 0: He's Johnny.

771
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,389
Speaker 1: Johnny Can't fuck this one up.

772
00:42:53,591 --> 00:42:54,519
Speaker 0: He's going to buy.

773
00:42:57,722 --> 00:42:58,549
Speaker 1: He's buying a pimp.

774
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,517
Speaker 1: like there's a new pimp in town.

775
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,527
Speaker 1: We're gonna buy him.

776
00:43:00,587 --> 00:43:01,920
Speaker 1: get him get him into first.

777
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,166
Speaker 0: But he's gonna buy a caravan from some.

778
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:12,419
Speaker 1: but the jobs might be things like this job will pay out 20 grand But you need a nightclub and a senator and a shitload of cocaine.

779
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:15,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, you need like the jobs that pay out a lot.

780
00:43:15,129 --> 00:43:16,254
Speaker 0: the requirements are big.

781
00:43:16,575 --> 00:43:26,172
Speaker 0: so the way to win this game is To get lots and lots of people to agree to do things with you right like if I make a deal with rim and I Make a deal with every other play like one deal with each other player.

782
00:43:26,574 --> 00:43:29,386
Speaker 0: I'm now doing four deals I'm making bank right.

783
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:38,300
Speaker 0: you want to get as many things to execute as possible and You got to look at who's winning and you you can just direct screwing right in terms of murdering people.

784
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:40,340
Speaker 0: So you look at who's winning and you target their shit.

785
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:46,065
Speaker 0: so it doesn't happen and make sure that you're the person who successfully executes the most deals, but Everything is.

786
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,115
Speaker 0: all that matters at the end of the game is how much money you got.

787
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:49,140
Speaker 1: all you want at the end is money.

788
00:43:49,381 --> 00:43:50,605
Speaker 1: Everything is transaction.

789
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:51,828
Speaker 0: just mobster wins.

790
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:55,560
Speaker 1: well you do get some bonuses for if you still have all your mob.

791
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:56,744
Speaker 0: Turn into money though.

792
00:43:56,764 --> 00:44:02,044
Speaker 1: I yeah everything turns into money and for mobsters you have killed yep So you got.

793
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:11,580
Speaker 1: there's a little bit of an extra incentive to kill some people toward the end Because I sensibly if you have more mobsters alive, and you've killed other mobsters It makes your mob in like a better position.

794
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:18,652
Speaker 0: It's also a side effect like if you've done if you're if you're in the position where you've killed more and have your guys killed Less you've probably completed more jobs.

795
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:19,719
Speaker 0: Oh, yes done more stuff.

796
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:25,440
Speaker 1: So like some jobs are like whack like literally just kill some right some other mobster.

797
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:29,940
Speaker 1: Some of them are like bust somebody up like bust up someone else's pimp.

798
00:44:30,161 --> 00:44:32,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they're like they're out of commission, but then they come back.

799
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is oh, here's a specific job senators party.

800
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,325
Speaker 1: This is what I was thinking of.

801
00:44:36,746 --> 00:44:39,237
Speaker 1: it'll pay out if you get two successes 24 grand.

802
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,220
Speaker 0: Yeah There's a little bit of randomness going on if you get one sick.

803
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:47,960
Speaker 1: But you can mitigate that randomness by putting the better mobsters on something or like putting a henchman down and you roll more dice.

804
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:58,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it's only one success 18 grand, but you need a politician a nightclub a pimp and a drug dealer All the things you need for the senator's party.

805
00:44:58,449 --> 00:44:59,473
Speaker 1: It's very thematic.

806
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:01,240
Speaker 1: Like the theme of this game is a plus.

807
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:06,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you go around putting all your guys on the jobs and then you go around again executing the jobs.

808
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:12,379
Speaker 1: So I might I might have a job that when I trigger it thought I need a nightclub and a pimp.

809
00:45:13,362 --> 00:45:16,914
Speaker 1: What if I trick don't trigger that job right away on Scott's turn?

810
00:45:17,235 --> 00:45:18,299
Speaker 1: He just murders the pimp.

811
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:22,220
Speaker 1: Now my job is gonna fail if I trigger the mobster.

812
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,200
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna make a deal to get another pimp in a hurry.

813
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:31,460
Speaker 0: So if you're gonna do the senator's party, which is worth a lot of money You're gonna want to do that when you're gonna go first so you can do it before anyone kills the senator.

814
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:39,732
Speaker 1: So a lot of games that have this like a scenario confluence Let's say where you can just make binding deals with everybody all the time forever.

815
00:45:40,253 --> 00:45:42,640
Speaker 1: They tend to bog down in the deal-making phase.

816
00:45:42,842 --> 00:45:50,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, this game avoids that because every player takes a short simple action and you just keep going around and going around and going around and going around.

817
00:45:50,980 --> 00:46:00,351
Speaker 0: That's a nice modern design there, you know, wait, no waiting constant doing game doesn't feel long, but it also means that Negotiations will happen when they're relevant.

818
00:46:00,732 --> 00:46:01,977
Speaker 1: I might make a deal in advance.

819
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:02,740
Speaker 1: I might make deals.

820
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:06,875
Speaker 0: You're usually only making a deal relevant to if it's relevant to the one simple action.

821
00:46:06,895 --> 00:46:07,578
Speaker 0: You're about to take.

822
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:13,416
Speaker 0: Yep, or Have a deal in my hand and during the before it's time to put out the deals.

823
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:14,380
Speaker 0: That's what I'm like.

824
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,187
Speaker 0: Well, I want to make this deal happen this turn.

825
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:17,874
Speaker 0: I'm missing these two things.

826
00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:19,540
Speaker 0: Let's see who has those two things.

827
00:46:19,842 --> 00:46:21,577
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to deal with those two things.

828
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:21,879
Speaker 0: Yep

829
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:41,136
Speaker 1: so the player whose turn it is to do their action is likely to be making the more urgent deals and capturing the attention whoever they need but simultaneously if Joey Jojo is taking a long time on his turn because it's a complicated turn or he's negotiating a big deal Me and Scott on the side might just talking about start talking about like hey Let's trade pimp for pimp for the future like things like that.

830
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:44,812
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm The mechanic of the deals is really elegant to the.

831
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:50,754
Speaker 1: if you want to use someone's thing You get the right to put a deal marker on that thing.

832
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:51,396
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

833
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:54,625
Speaker 1: The other player Can't renege on that deal.

834
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:59,040
Speaker 1: Nope, nor like I can use that pimp for whatever I want, right?

835
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,580
Speaker 0: It's like rim says okay, you can put your marker on my pimp.

836
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:02,840
Speaker 0: I put the marker on his pimp now.

837
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,799
Speaker 0: That means I can use it once and remove the token.

838
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:10,640
Speaker 0: But now everyone else when they're like killing they look around the board and they see like a pimp with like three tokens on it.

839
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,575
Speaker 0: They're like, I guess I'm killing that pimp.

840
00:47:12,716 --> 00:47:18,697
Speaker 0: Yep That's gonna kill like mess up three other people's plans, yep, so it's it's.

841
00:47:18,737 --> 00:47:25,123
Speaker 0: on this one hand It's like a good mechanic, but it's also a great indicator and really mess with people's heuristics You don't want to like.

842
00:47:25,324 --> 00:47:30,565
Speaker 0: do I really want to ask him if I can borrow his pimp if it already has a marker from Someone else on it.

843
00:47:30,665 --> 00:47:31,309
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

844
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:32,576
Speaker 0: That's gonna get that pimp killed.

845
00:47:32,597 --> 00:47:33,140
Speaker 0: There's no point.

846
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:35,124
Speaker 0: Do something else?

847
00:47:35,365 --> 00:47:36,108
Speaker 1: No, no, I want to use.

848
00:47:36,129 --> 00:47:38,740
Speaker 0: maybe I'll buy my own pimp from the middle even though it cost me money.

849
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,537
Speaker 1: No, no, I want to use your other pimp Scott not the one you're loading up that other pimp.

850
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:44,024
Speaker 1: That's right Give me your good pimp.

851
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:44,487
Speaker 0: That's right.

852
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:47,200
Speaker 0: And then when I go around then I say oh which pimp do I want to kill?

853
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,809
Speaker 0: Well rims losing the game.

854
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:50,260
Speaker 0: I don't really need to kill any of his stuff.

855
00:47:50,383 --> 00:47:50,979
Speaker 0: Oh, but what's that?

856
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:56,280
Speaker 0: I see Joey Jojo's got a marker on rims pimp and Jojo does win in the game.

857
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,738
Speaker 0: I can hurt Joey Jojo and rim by attacking that dude.

858
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:20,355
Speaker 1: Yep so despite being highly political the politics is deeply constrained by the Realities of the game and the deal-making ends up being the right level of complexity like the kinds of deals I've seen having played this game a few times are things like here's God if you let me use your pimp I'll cut you in 50% on the deal that that pimp facilitates.

859
00:48:20,415 --> 00:48:26,660
Speaker 0: That's perfectly fine deal Especially if you make such deals frequently with a lot of players and most of them execute.

860
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:31,560
Speaker 0: You will end up on the plus side because everyone else will have executed one deal and you'll have executed three or four.

861
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:34,454
Speaker 1: Yep, or I might make a deal like listen Scott.

862
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:44,760
Speaker 1: Let me use your pimp I'll give you five grand in cash right now because if you have a deal that pays out Until you trigger the deal as one of your actions, you don't have that money.

863
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,375
Speaker 1: So getting cash up front might be very valuable to be able to afford the business.

864
00:48:50,435 --> 00:48:55,134
Speaker 0: I forget if you can kill your own dudes Yeah, you can bash your own dude, I think right.

865
00:48:55,154 --> 00:48:55,879
Speaker 0: so maybe not?

866
00:48:56,462 --> 00:48:57,045
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

867
00:48:57,105 --> 00:48:57,486
Speaker 0: if you could.

868
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:58,109
Speaker 0: I don't think I did.

869
00:48:58,149 --> 00:48:58,611
Speaker 0: no one did.

870
00:48:58,631 --> 00:48:59,696
Speaker 1: I don't think I would.

871
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:05,339
Speaker 0: I think I might have asked But it's like I could make a deal or like alright, you can use my pimp Give me some money and then I shoot my pimp.

872
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:11,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that generally like the other thing I've seen happen is the because this thing is just keeping the pimp.

873
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,498
Speaker 0: He does spit out money all the time and because it's a real transactional negotiating game.

874
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:22,900
Speaker 1: I've found reliably that players who act in good faith tend to get ignored by the other players or just attacked outright.

875
00:49:24,033 --> 00:49:32,448
Speaker 1: and Revenge is a powerful mechanic in the context of this game in a way that I haven't seen play out in other games that have Similar themes and mechanics.

876
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:51,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, this game is just a very Well-crafted Perfect storm of the right mechanics the right turn length the right level of interaction To give you all that fun feeling of a kind of serious and realistic mafia game Without getting too bogged down in details and without being just advanced werewolf.

877
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:54,854
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing about the other thing about this game is that it's just cards.

878
00:49:55,456 --> 00:49:57,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just all cards So it's real cash.

879
00:49:57,606 --> 00:49:58,168
Speaker 0: It's all.

880
00:49:58,189 --> 00:49:59,716
Speaker 0: the cash is a little is papers.

881
00:49:59,776 --> 00:50:00,520
Speaker 0: It was not the greatest.

882
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:01,566
Speaker 0: I think I might replace it.

883
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:02,492
Speaker 0: wasn't see.

884
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:03,658
Speaker 0: usually when I see paper money.

885
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:03,900
Speaker 0: I'm like.

886
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:10,320
Speaker 0: But actually I thought that when I saw the game set up on the table But actually when I was playing it was never a problem.

887
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,127
Speaker 1: Oh, it feels good.

888
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:12,558
Speaker 1: when you like I asked someone to go.

889
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:18,066
Speaker 0: I think I would still replace it with chips just because you know Right, but I don't know.

890
00:50:18,146 --> 00:50:20,537
Speaker 0: I feel it didn't upset me like bad paper cash.

891
00:50:20,557 --> 00:50:21,040
Speaker 0: in other games.

892
00:50:23,066 --> 00:50:27,380
Speaker 1: Something felt good about getting a fat stack of cash and then doing the one for you one for me.

893
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to do for me one.

894
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:31,213
Speaker 0: It's two for you one two for me.

895
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:39,220
Speaker 0: But anyway, but the If you made chips or replace the money you could really pack this game small.

896
00:50:39,521 --> 00:50:42,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, sighs the games already really small.

897
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:46,040
Speaker 0: I'm saying size per game really good ratio.

898
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:48,650
Speaker 1: It also ain't that expensive like I forget.

899
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:55,396
Speaker 0: I'm saying it's a lot of game in a small package And it doesn't take that long to play but you get a lot when you do play it.

900
00:50:56,019 --> 00:51:00,939
Speaker 1: All right Oh, yeah, and there's an expansion that adds more mobsters that are powers which also it's very easy to expand.

00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,029

Speaker 1: Yes or threatening people in a way that will actually elicit a response other than fuck You it's risk.

00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:21,878
Speaker 0: I'll let you borrow this guy and this guy But then you're gonna give me half the money from that deal and I get had the money from that.

929
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:32,806
Speaker 1: in one game I sold insurance to people where if they gave me five grand then I would give immunity from certain kinds of negative activities And protection rackets work in this game.

930
00:52:32,846 --> 00:52:35,574
Speaker 1: And sometimes it's worth it to pay the protection racket.

931
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:36,878
