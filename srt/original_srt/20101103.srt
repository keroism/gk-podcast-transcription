1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,287
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday November 3rd.

2
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:10,970
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,058
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,587
Speaker 0: tonight 2010 we review eaten of the East.

5
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:24,230
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,650
Speaker 0: I Gotta say the year we've had like five years of geek nights.

7
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:37,785
Speaker 1: I don't think it sounds good when you say the year And it's also not necessary because if someone I'd like on the daily show any like real show.

8
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:42,921
Speaker 1: It's like September 28th 2014 sounds good when they say because of their style.

9
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:47,721
Speaker 1: if you could reformat the Opener somehow to get the year in I think it's fine.

10
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:49,087
Speaker 0: You know it's blah blah blah.

11
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:49,991
Speaker 0: 2010.

12
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,539
Speaker 0: How does 2010 in any way sound bad?

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,603
Speaker 1: It sounds bad?

14
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:53,864
Speaker 0: Why?

15
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:54,807
Speaker 0: what's bad about it?

16
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:55,730
Speaker 0: It just sounds bad.

17
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,098
Speaker 1: I was aesthetically displeasing to you.

18
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:00,205
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone else cares.

19
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:01,550
Speaker 1: I think it is not necessary.

20
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:05,170
Speaker 0: I think it's very necessary because we've had five years of show.

21
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,140
Speaker 1: Figure out what year the show they're listening to is.

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,722
Speaker 1: I mean it's.

23
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:11,211
Speaker 1: you know it might be hard to figure out the date and the Month.

24
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,499
Speaker 0: it's all the iTunes users though.

25
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,525
Speaker 0: They'll never come to the website.

26
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:14,190
Speaker 0: They'll have no idea.

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,153
Speaker 0: There's no way.

28
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:18,265
Speaker 1: if they're using iTunes the date is in fucking iTunes.

29
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:21,323
Speaker 0: only if they look at it I know it's also on your iPod.

30
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:28,824
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't look at it It's all right, but in there if they really need to know what year it is then they'll look Yeah, mark my words someday like Otakon.

31
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:33,890
Speaker 0: like four years from now Someone's gonna call us and be like you said you were gonna be at Otakon.

32
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,542
Speaker 1: That's their own damn fault for being a Moran.

33
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:43,692
Speaker 0: see I can agree with a lot of your points But I can't agree that it somehow sounds bad to say the year It.

34
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:46,001
Speaker 1: it sounds bad the way we have it structured.

35
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:47,970
Speaker 1: why restructure it to get the year in there?

36
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,519
Speaker 0: It's you know Wednesday November 3rd 2010.

37
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,926
Speaker 0: No Scott sucks, and this is geek nights.

38
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:56,650
Speaker 1: It's no good.

39
00:01:57,254 --> 00:02:08,249
Speaker 0: So I have been watching a bunch of anime lately And I've been trying to use the more legitimate means of watching anime Which doesn't matter because half the anime I want to watch aren't released in the US.

40
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:14,430
Speaker 1: anime I'm watching right now is galaxy railways, which I bought completely legitimately from those incredibly inexpensive DVDs.

41
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:21,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, and apparently there's a whole this is only the first 20 some odd episodes And there's actually a lot more that are not on DVD.

42
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:25,003
Speaker 0: And I just got my try gun box set that I paid $30 for.

43
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:25,304
Speaker 0: re-released.

44
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:27,473
Speaker 1: That's less.

45
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:30,667
Speaker 1: It's like only a little over a dollar per that per episode.

46
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:31,410
Speaker 1: That's a good price.

47
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:34,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's definitely worth it for one of the best anime ever.

48
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:39,150
Speaker 0: I I hope it stands up because I haven't seen it in about seven years.

49
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,686
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it in a long time, but I think it'll hold many times back then.

50
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:45,272
Speaker 0: I think it'll hold up We'll see.

51
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:49,430
Speaker 0: but so I'm watching that and I've been watching Eden of the East which you know obviously reviewing.

52
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:56,290
Speaker 0: But I've been trying to watch a lot of anime through the anime news networks kind of hobo Hulu equivalent.

53
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,012
Speaker 0: Why are you doing that?

54
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,036
Speaker 1: Why don't you use a crunchyroll?

55
00:02:58,497 --> 00:03:00,845
Speaker 0: So, you know, the East was released legitimately.

56
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:01,889
Speaker 0: crunchyroll is not gonna have it.

57
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:05,646
Speaker 0: Oh crunchyroll doesn't have it now because it's released legitimately.

58
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,390
Speaker 0: I could get it.

59
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,997
Speaker 0: I mean there are towards I could get.

60
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,324
Speaker 0: so I go to the anime news network thing Which links to like the different websites and they've got a million anime.

61
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:15,590
Speaker 0: You can just watch them subbed.

62
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,436
Speaker 0: They've got dubs for a lot of the shows.

63
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:21,090
Speaker 0: It's not that bad except the video quality is pretty low.

64
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:22,616
Speaker 0: It takes forever to load.

65
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,930
Speaker 0: the ads don't work at all.

66
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,428
Speaker 1: It's a good thing.

67
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:31,330
Speaker 0: It is a good thing except that every time it comes to the point where the ad would play and crunchyroll's ads works.

68
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,904
Speaker 1: They're always watching these stupid skittles ads.

69
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,582
Speaker 0: over and over again A pop-up appears over the video that you have to close.

70
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:44,675
Speaker 0: that basically says trying to load ad Oh, and then it just immediately plays the rest of the episode Alrighty, so I can't really complain about that.

71
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,559
Speaker 0: Except the pop-up keeps coming this kind of annoying.

72
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:50,653
Speaker 1: and Well, imagine an ad every time that pop-up shows up.

73
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,160
Speaker 1: and how glad you are is just a pop-up.

74
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,565
Speaker 0: Even if the East has a really good opener It has that Oasis song.

75
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:59,279
Speaker 0: like it's a solid anime opener the kind like a ghost in the shell openers.

76
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,509
Speaker 0: Well, I'll watch it every single episode.

77
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:02,915
Speaker 0: Like I'll just watch it every time.

78
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:04,926
Speaker 1: I didn't watch it every time I watched it enough times.

79
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:11,112
Speaker 0: Yeah, they changed the opener Because they couldn't afford to pay Oasis for the rights to the song.

80
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:13,460
Speaker 1: How come the Japanese could afford it apparent?

81
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,627
Speaker 0: I don't know what happened in Japan, but at least in the American release They changed it to this Japanese song.

82
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:24,427
Speaker 1: and how come when the Japanese people pay how come that doesn't include the rights for The showing the show in every country?

83
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:26,996
Speaker 0: because DDR was never even licensed in the US.

84
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,726
Speaker 1: I know right it's like if I buy.

85
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:40,292
Speaker 1: if I make a movie and I pay a Rim for a song he made to put in my movie Then I sell that movie in other countries.

86
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,939
Speaker 1: I shouldn't have to pay again.

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, but copyright laws really broken.

88
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:47,980
Speaker 0: so bullshit, but they made you know, right boy they made an opener.

89
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:49,972
Speaker 0: It's they sorry.

90
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:50,799
Speaker 0: Hi Ami sang it.

91
00:04:51,081 --> 00:05:05,236
Speaker 0: It's really really stupid and it makes the show feel like a crappy kind of standard show Like watching the opener with that music has such a different vibe that I probably wouldn't have bothered with the show right away Had I seen that first?

92
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,460
Speaker 0: Have the reason I watched Eden of the East was that I watched the Japanese opener and I was really intrigued.

93
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:13,352
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, you know the abuse of greatness and all that it was.

94
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:15,019
Speaker 1: isn't this the main bit for our show?

95
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:17,032
Speaker 1: Yeah, so are you wasting it in your news section?

96
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:19,648
Speaker 0: cuz I'm reviewing this meta stuff That has almost nothing to do with the show.

97
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:25,939
Speaker 0: Well, you're reviewing the opener of the show right now Yeah, and the opener of the show is not on the legal way to watch the goddamn show.

98
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:31,220
Speaker 0: So I just pirated blu-ray rips of Eden of the East and much better idea much better idea.

99
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,688
Speaker 0: There's no broken ad that pops up every few.

100
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,149
Speaker 0: Let's see.

101
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,654
Speaker 1: Why are people pirating things?

102
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,340
Speaker 1: because legitimate stuff sucks.

103
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:46,000
Speaker 0: It was faster to download the torrent the blu-ray HD rip than it was if I added up all the delays.

104
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,720
Speaker 0: I'm trying to watch the show on anime news network because it takes forever to load even on my files.

105
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,205
Speaker 1: I don't know why crunchyroll doesn't have it.

106
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:54,153
Speaker 1: I mean crunchyroll has other legitimate things.

107
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:57,582
Speaker 0: I know there's definitely the Legit right.

108
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:58,465
Speaker 0: It's trying something.

109
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:03,278
Speaker 0: I mean this anime news network thing even pops up like watch it legally.

110
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,115
Speaker 0: Oh, oh Yeah.

111
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:10,876
Speaker 0: So, I don't know I'm not impressed but there is a lot of anime there and you can.

112
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:20,280
Speaker 0: I would recommend if you're a punk Kid and you don't want to use bit torrent you can watch the show with the same impact on the anime industry Technically legally and still not see ads.

113
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:24,225
Speaker 1: Well So check this out, right?

114
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:24,787
Speaker 1: I'm checking.

115
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:30,531
Speaker 1: normally when this remakes or nostalgia trips or whatever I'm like, ah, whatever fuck that shit.

116
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:31,415
Speaker 1: All right, who cares?

117
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:37,491
Speaker 1: but Somebody is gonna make a remake of Thundercats.

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,937
Speaker 0: Wait, so Thundercats as far as I can tell was just an extended adolescence metaphor where his penis was a sword.

119
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:48,519
Speaker 1: Yes.

120
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:55,480
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but anyway, the thing is about Thundercats why it is different from the other kid grew to symbolize his adulthood.

121
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,309
Speaker 1: Is that why I was a kid, right?

122
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:04,292
Speaker 1: I mean I liked all those shows the Voltron Transformers I liked GI Joe, but I really only liked the movie.

123
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:07,462
Speaker 0: I didn't.

124
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:10,735
Speaker 1: actually really I wasn't really much about GI Joe at all, but I wasn't.

125
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:11,860
Speaker 1: you know, the other stuff was all great.

126
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:13,550
Speaker 1: I love mask and he-man.

127
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:20,560
Speaker 1: I did not enjoy Transformers that much but Thundercats was like for me at least was like the number one.

128
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,505
Speaker 1: I mean Voltron.

129
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,238
Speaker 1: the robot is the most powerful and of all nothing.

130
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:30,625
Speaker 0: to be bold It is telling why I had far more Centurions toys than I did Thundercats toys Yeah, but thing is I most?

131
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:33,940
Speaker 1: I mean, you know how every toy set had like a big toy, right?

132
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,886
Speaker 1: Ninja Turtles had the sewer right?

133
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,656
Speaker 0: I had that no and it was really chintzy.

134
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:43,815
Speaker 1: and like The techno drone, you know transformers you could get fortress maximum.

135
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:45,260
Speaker 0: I never had that right?

136
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,819
Speaker 1: I mean there was always a big toy.

137
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:55,900
Speaker 1: the only thing I ever had the big toy for Was the Thundercats lair with the friggin flashlight in the mouth and the opening hands of the tanks that rolled out.

138
00:07:56,181 --> 00:08:08,074
Speaker 1: That's the only big toy for any of the action figures that I had and I had Frickin lino and panthro and the kids and I had this mum-ra playset where you would spin around and There'd be mother be old mum-ra.

139
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:08,779
Speaker 1: It would be you know.

140
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Speaker 1: Oh, I remember ads for that and you'd spin it around and then the big mom-ra would come out.

141
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,011
Speaker 1: And then I also had the big mum-ra - and I had fucking.

142
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:18,496
Speaker 0: I'd see the ads for that crap.

143
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:23,120
Speaker 1: like right after double-day I had the snake mutant guy and the jackal mutant and I didn't have the bird mutant.

144
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:24,791
Speaker 1: Anyway, I had I was.

145
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,139
Speaker 1: Thundercats was like number one.

146
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,753
Speaker 0: I never saw the first episode of Thundercats until a few years ago.

147
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,380
Speaker 1: the first episodes the best ever said it.

148
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,303
Speaker 0: I just never saw it.

149
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:33,869
Speaker 1: It's also a Thundercats movie.

150
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,576
Speaker 1: We're just like a multi-parter situation.

151
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:36,480
Speaker 0: I never saw that either.

152
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,298
Speaker 1: Oh, man, that's actually you know, it's like it's weird cuz but I did see the My Little Pony movie in theaters.

153
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,995
Speaker 1: exciting Yeah, I think I did too.

154
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:45,930
Speaker 1: So this remake of Thundercats, right?

155
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:47,760
Speaker 1: Like why would I get excited about this?

156
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:53,522
Speaker 1: You know There've been other remakes of things recently and they've been hit or miss and I don't really need to pay attention to that much Thunder.

157
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:55,229
Speaker 1: what is interesting about this remake?

158
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:58,160
Speaker 1: Well so far we have three facts about it.

159
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:01,933
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a whole big article But there's really only three facts in the article that mattered.

160
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:16,491
Speaker 1: fact number one The guy in charge of it is this Jalen ik guy and apparently he's the guy who did Batman brave in the bold cartoon Which is a very popular and well liked cartoon among the nerds, even though I've never seen it the nerds like it So that makes some people happy.

161
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:22,511
Speaker 1: All right fact number two Snarf is in it, but he will only say snarf snarf.

162
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:23,394
Speaker 1: He won't say anything else.

163
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:25,120
Speaker 0: He's not gonna say Sam a flange.

164
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:29,220
Speaker 0: Panther said Sam if I have a snarf could also say Sam a flange.

165
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,585
Speaker 1: The thing is I'm like.

166
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,778
Speaker 1: I kind of kind of understand that cuz you were changing the tone of the show.

167
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:38,472
Speaker 1: if there's a talking Snarf who's sort of like, you know, he's not as he's not a Jar Jar Binks.

168
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:39,455
Speaker 0: He's definitely the.

169
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,200
Speaker 0: I don't know about this character.

170
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,718
Speaker 1: yeah, he you know, he sort of throws it off if you go with the darker theme, which is what it's going for.

171
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,226
Speaker 1: but I Like I actually don't find snarf to be annoying.

172
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,749
Speaker 1: I think he's just fine, you know.

173
00:09:51,641 --> 00:10:02,871
Speaker 1: anyway, the third and most important fact is that it is a joint venture between Warner Brothers who I guess owns Thundercats now and Studio four degrees C.

174
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:04,077
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

175
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:13,338
Speaker 1: Oh shit that is like doom stamp of platinum 4c is Hot hotness as hotness right.

176
00:10:13,398 --> 00:10:20,970
Speaker 1: all these other remakes did not have like, you know Like huge awesome perfect studio of awesomeness on the list, right?

177
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,039
Speaker 1: You know, so it'll be like that's.

178
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:31,102
Speaker 1: basically it would be equivalently awesome if they said oh, yeah This is a joint venture between Warner Brothers and Studio Ghibli like oh snap.

179
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:35,970
Speaker 1: or if they said yeah So she can come back from the dead to do Thundercats.

180
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:43,689
Speaker 0: You know considering that it's a long adolescence metaphor where the sword is his penis and it grows every time he has to assert himself It should have been guy next.

181
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:46,909
Speaker 1: That would have been a different show.

182
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:49,788
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah.

183
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:51,802
Speaker 1: So I'm definitely gonna.

184
00:10:51,822 --> 00:11:00,820
Speaker 0: oh, oh my god I got to make a little video mashup now of that scene from the beginning of the Ava movie and Just dub line of saying Thunder Thunder Thunder.

185
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,341
Speaker 1: go for it.

186
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:01,823
Speaker 0: I'll do it.

187
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,310
Speaker 1: But anyway, this is a I'm liking this.

188
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:06,270
Speaker 1: This is looking like it's going in a good direction.

189
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:11,736
Speaker 1: Obviously judgment needs to be withheld until we see the real thing as with all things But I'm gonna.

190
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,644
Speaker 1: I'm slightly looking forward to it.

191
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:16,729
Speaker 1: I'm gonna keep my eye open my eye of Thundera.

192
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:26,227
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

193
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:39,068
Speaker 0: I fell into a deep nostalgia trip when I was watching something from the 70s and thought it looked really old and Then suddenly felt the urge to look at things from the 80s and 90s and realized that they look just as old.

194
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:47,294
Speaker 0: so I have for you two TV shows that I watch and Enjoyed as a kid.

195
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:50,025
Speaker 0: Alrighty, and it saddens me.

196
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:51,130
Speaker 1: I was just talking about Thundercats.

197
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,380
Speaker 1: Is it Thundercats now?

198
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,529
Speaker 0: as much as this saddens me?

199
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:57,887
Speaker 0: There's a YouTube comment on the first one that says quote better than the stuff on g4.

200
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,525
Speaker 1: Okay, it must be video game related.

201
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,109
Speaker 1: It's Captain N.

202
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:05,124
Speaker 0: I kind of after captain is not better than g4 captain.

203
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:06,028
Speaker 0: that is not better than g4.

204
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,923
Speaker 0: But do you remember game pro TV barely?

205
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,530
Speaker 0: or the one you probably remember video power.

206
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:15,630
Speaker 1: I remember video power excellently.

207
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:20,410
Speaker 1: I was so annoyed about video power because he would end when I got home.

208
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,450
Speaker 1: So I get home and I'd see the velcro and I wouldn't get to see the dude for me.

209
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,060
Speaker 0: It was on before I went to school.

210
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:25,664
Speaker 0: It was not at 6 a.m.

211
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,034
Speaker 1: Oh mine was.

212
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,563
Speaker 1: it was only on right before I got.

213
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:34,569
Speaker 1: I would get up at 545 like the middle middle school kids who got home a half hour an hour earlier got to see it.

214
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,689
Speaker 1: The elementary school kids didn't get to see that shit.

215
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,408
Speaker 0: So all I remembered about the show was kids play real video games and compete and it was awesome and wacky.

216
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:47,050
Speaker 0: and then at the End whoever wins puts down a velcro vest and runs through a mini toy store.

217
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,659
Speaker 1: No You actually had two people on your team and you could.

218
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,218
Speaker 1: you had to take turns going in with the velcro and you had to tag out.

219
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:58,483
Speaker 0: All I remember is that you would velcro games to your chest.

220
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:04,003
Speaker 0: and if you Nintendo games if you made it out before The timer went off you got to keep all those games.

221
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,683
Speaker 0: and if you found the secret game You want a special prize like a neo geo?

222
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:08,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, holy shit.

223
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:12,464
Speaker 1: And I mean think about you're a kid of one.

224
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:22,670
Speaker 1: getting one video game is like Oh, I got one Nintendo game like a month And if that I got a lot less than that like one winner a few months, so you get a video game.

225
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:24,314
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god I got a video.

226
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:25,439
Speaker 0: watch these kids on TV.

227
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:31,690
Speaker 1: if they win this game and they're less like video game every second They're going down the shelf being like game game game game game.

228
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:40,008
Speaker 1: By being good at the games I was already good at he's velcro them to their bodies there this velcro suit and then they have to just leave.

229
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:40,489
Speaker 1: and it's like.

230
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,708
Speaker 1: It's like shoplifting Toys R Us with no consequences.

231
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:51,610
Speaker 0: It was like Hey, remember that old contest with Toys R Us the you get five minutes and as many shopping carts as you.

232
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many times did that ever actually happen?

233
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:55,367
Speaker 0: Yeah, I believe it did.

234
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:55,769
Speaker 0: I don't know.

235
00:13:56,731 --> 00:14:02,650
Speaker 0: I just I saw videos of people winning it and I remember them like running down aisles with their hands out like grabbing toys.

236
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,070
Speaker 1: I would have gone I would just gone to three aisles and they luckily these aisles are right next to each other.

237
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,813
Speaker 1: So I was there.

238
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:11,769
Speaker 1: us Nintendo tiger now would have gone to the video game aisle, right?

239
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:18,934
Speaker 1: Then right next to the video game aisle and the Toys R Us was the Lego aisle and board game on all the leg And it was the same aisle.

240
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:28,430
Speaker 1: so I could take a Lego from one side and board game from the other and toss him in And then run the hell out before time ran out and I would just get all the biggest Lego I'd be like, you know what?

241
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,817
Speaker 1: $300 Lego castles fuck.

242
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:33,221
Speaker 1: Yes, so you do.

243
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:36,190
Speaker 1: now watching of the biggest castle video power again.

244
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,049
Speaker 0: They're playing Megaman and that's cool.

245
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:45,170
Speaker 0: But these kids I think that this was a pivotal moment for the two contestants in video power because they any good at Megaman.

246
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:46,638
Speaker 0: Hey, they were okay.

247
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:48,749
Speaker 0: They were as good as every kid was back then.

248
00:14:49,151 --> 00:15:02,556
Speaker 0: They were like the legends but these kids have the look of children who came in with expectations had those shattered saw behind the veil now understand what the real world is and Are going to live productive lives.

249
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:09,390
Speaker 1: then video power served a great purpose even though that is not the purpose It was trying to serve because it served for the greater good.

250
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,953
Speaker 0: You can tell they were so excited because I would have been so excited but they have this look on their faces Like really?

251
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:18,230
Speaker 0: This is what I was excited about for the last three years.

252
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:21,610
Speaker 0: This is what I thought would be the climax of my life.

253
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,204
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure they got excited when they got to go velcro games Except for the kid who didn't get to go.

254
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:30,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's very Blue shirt and he has a bowl cut.

255
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:30,759
Speaker 0: He's kind of funny.

256
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, those old video game game shows are were exciting.

257
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,066
Speaker 0: What's weird is that TV from the 70s looks better than TV from the 80s and the 90s?

258
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:45,830
Speaker 1: Well, the reason for that is that TV from the 70s that we still have available to us What we actually have the Masters from the studios.

259
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,070
Speaker 1: But TV from the 80s that we still have available to us was mostly VHS and Betamax recordings.

260
00:15:50,218 --> 00:16:02,117
Speaker 1: Yeah So it actually looked better on the television when you were watching it Even though the technology was largely the same because it was still mostly over-the-air broadcast color TV with no higher resolution or anything Even though the tubes improved in the 80s, right?

261
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,889
Speaker 1: The signal really wasn't any different or better anything like that.

262
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,180
Speaker 1: I guess the cameras also improved at the at the studios.

263
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:18,089
Speaker 0: more than anything is that this old crap is terrible But the faux glamour that they were trying to convey now actually exists and is called the penny arcade Expo.

264
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:21,976
Speaker 0: Anyway, that was a lot but I don't know.

265
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,887
Speaker 0: I very much enjoyed watching these and also did not enjoy watching these.

266
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:33,410
Speaker 1: Alright, so Today is an important day because something is being released and no it is not the Kinect which is also being released at midnight tonight.

267
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:43,082
Speaker 1: Yeah It is a new album from Machine Supremacy and I like to pronounce the name of their band Maki Nai Supremacy because that's how it's spelled even though technically it's Machine Supremacy.

268
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:47,104
Speaker 1: and this is important because What are you doing?

269
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:56,158
Speaker 1: nothing, all right, this is very important because they only release like one album every couple years and Because they are like.

270
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:58,630
Speaker 1: you might as well call them geek nights the band.

271
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,914
Speaker 1: Alright It is.

272
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:07,266
Speaker 1: they are in a genre of music known as quote Sid metal because they say it is the chip that were the audio chip from the Commodore 64.

273
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:12,808
Speaker 0: one of the few things I want to make happen at PAX that doesn't already happen is to have them do a concert.

274
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,954
Speaker 0: Absolutely I would do almost anything to make that.

275
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:21,844
Speaker 1: and basically they started as a Commodore 64 back cover band doing you know see Commodore remixes of Commodore 64 songs.

276
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:30,570
Speaker 1: and Now they basically they're a metal band that incorporates these unique sound of the Commodore 64 into their music.

277
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:34,410
Speaker 1: And they have a new album that just came out called a view from the end of the world.

278
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,479
Speaker 1: It's also the title of the first song.

279
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:41,557
Speaker 1: All right, but I want to prove to you that That they are geek nights the band.

280
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:47,584
Speaker 1: All right, and I don't know if they listen to geek nights or what the hell But here are the lyrics to the.

281
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:53,123
Speaker 1: the second Song on the on the album, which is called force feedback.

282
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:54,207
Speaker 1: You ready for these lyrics room?

283
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:55,534
Speaker 1: I'm ready All right, these are.

284
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,363
Speaker 1: these might as well have been written by geek nights.

285
00:17:57,383 --> 00:17:58,006
Speaker 1: Are you ready for this?

286
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,004
Speaker 1: Okay Take a look across this vast uncharted battlefield.

287
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:02,667
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna sing.

288
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:10,830
Speaker 1: by the way You still don't know your enemy a bunch of pissed-off freaks with infinite mad skills and a newfound taste for blood.

289
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,279

00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:00,170

00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:05,776
Speaker 0: she know Eden is Pretty much the newest anime.

337
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:12,123
Speaker 0: I've watched all the way through almost all the way through in a long time Other than like, you know stuff from the 90s.

338
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:18,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, I watched the first episode of the show a long ways back like maybe a year ago.

339
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,450
Speaker 1: I think we all that many watched it together and I was like, oh, that's a really interesting and unique premise.

340
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:24,474
Speaker 1: I'm interested in that.

341
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:25,498
Speaker 1: I didn't finish watching you.

342
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,891
Speaker 1: I just stopped and then recently I went back to it and I finished the whole Thing.

343
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:29,253
Speaker 0: Yep.

344
00:21:29,374 --> 00:21:35,930
Speaker 0: So the plot of Eden of the East not to spoil anything This is all pretty much first episode second episode stuff to see you.

345
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,813
Speaker 0: You know what you're getting into.

346
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:42,708
Speaker 0: it's the kind of show that you can sell to someone just by explaining the present the the whole That just explaining the premise the premise.

347
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:47,635
Speaker 0: Girl from Japan is in America Standing for to the White House.

348
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:53,094
Speaker 0: out of nowhere comes a naked dude with a cell phone a gun and amnesia Whoa.

349
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,976
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much the plot.

350
00:21:57,578 --> 00:21:58,622
Speaker 0: why is that guy naked?

351
00:21:58,983 --> 00:21:59,966
Speaker 0: what's with the cell phone?

352
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:01,010
Speaker 0: Why do you have a gun?

353
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know the girls just like a normal Japanese tourist girl.

354
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,373
Speaker 1: She's not like.

355
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:10,007
Speaker 0: I'd argue that she's desperately cute and not like the main girl characters.

356
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:10,750
Speaker 0: a lot of other anime.

357
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:14,870
Speaker 1: She's I mean, she's not stupid in my way right like oh save me.

358
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,859
Speaker 1: She's like a normal person who can take care of herself.

359
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, but she's also not a. She's not crazy or weird or anything, you know.

360
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:39,083
Speaker 1: she's intelligent and just a smart normal person and the only reason that she's there alone is because she was on like a trip with her school like a graduation trip or something and she She decided that she was gonna like, you know, they went to New York I think and she decided to take a side trip to DC because she want.

361
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:43,149
Speaker 1: she thought that the White House is like the center Of the world and she wanted to see the center of the world.

362
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:45,321
Speaker 1: You know, she had like a thing about it.

363
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:48,363
Speaker 1: She's like well, I'm here I'm gonna go check it out and then go back on my own.

364
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:49,270
Speaker 1: so she did so.

365
00:22:49,672 --> 00:23:00,850
Speaker 0: What it's really about which is also not a spoiler because you get this pretty much right away Dude has a cell phone that has eight point two billion dot yen, which is like a hundred million dollars Which actually isn't that much money?

366
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:08,827
Speaker 0: It's I'll take it and he has to spend it all and he'll die when he spends it all and he'll die if he doesn't Spend it all and he has to save Japan with it.

367
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:11,802
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, and it's basically the phone.

368
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:16,630
Speaker 1: he can call up on the phone and get anything He wants like he's in fact a sell-a-sell.

369
00:23:17,273 --> 00:23:18,942
Speaker 0: Skip all the kind of details.

370
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,410
Speaker 1: you can call anything on the phone.

371
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:25,510
Speaker 1: He could just be like kill so-and-so and then suddenly something will happen that will result in that person.

372
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,021
Speaker 0: There's a great point where he's tested out and he calls the phone.

373
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:31,554
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, he basically says yeah I'd love the Prime Minister to say uncle.

374
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:39,426
Speaker 0: and there's this live conference and the Prime Minister like gets a he's watching Japanese C-SPAN and then uncle uncle uncle.

375
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:44,357
Speaker 1: And it's like why And it totally worked.

376
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:48,215
Speaker 0: and it's this huge kind of spy Conspiracy technology.

377
00:23:48,516 --> 00:23:52,025
Speaker 0: half of it's about Google goggles and it goes in a lot of directions.

378
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:53,710
Speaker 0: You really wouldn't have expected from the first episode.

379
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's where it's like.

380
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:56,668
Speaker 1: the first episode was so great And I just wanted it to go.

381
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,990
Speaker 1: Basically, like what I wanted was to take the premise of the first episode and attack it straight on full force.

382
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:19,590
Speaker 1: But it sort of diverges and gets into these other side Tangents and it's sort of like, you know There's all sorts of stuff going on and which thing is the primary thing sort of changes like it goes down these branches along the Way and gets away from the main thing of what the hell with the sell us out shit, right?

383
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,430
Speaker 1: You know and naked guy who lost all his memories showing up, you know, it doesn't stick with that.

384
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:32,962
Speaker 0: There's just something about that Naked dude with the gun of cell phone and amnesia and you throw that in in the first five minutes of the first episode of a Show with no backstory at all.

385
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:38,826
Speaker 1: That's awesome But they sort of get away from it a little bit, you know, he's not naked.

386
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:40,887
Speaker 0: much longer though Johnny's come up a lot.

387
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:47,490
Speaker 0: In fact, I would say that's what the show is really about because in that episode There's a lot of English being spoken.

388
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:54,930
Speaker 1: Surprisingly well for an anime there it is strange how much like English speaking is going on like the helicopter pilots all speak English.

389
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, that female cop who's like, let me see your Johnny which I assumed meant.

390
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:03,557
Speaker 0: Let me see your ID And he showed her as Johnny.

391
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:06,730
Speaker 0: and then later there's a Johnny thief who yeah, Johnny thieves steal penises.

392
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:17,837
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, she murders guys and cuts their penises off either before or after and she had a good reason for doing it I guess somewhat kinda.

393
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:21,630
Speaker 0: that's one of those side plots that I really didn't care about.

394
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,132
Speaker 0: I didn't.

395
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:25,624
Speaker 1: I really have much to do with the main and it's not even that many episodes, right?

396
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:29,330
Speaker 1: It's like 13 11 It's 11 episodes really it's not.

397
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:31,298
Speaker 1: So have it.

398
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:32,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't watched the movies either.

399
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:35,262
Speaker 1: I heard that they were bad, but I don't know I got to watch them.

400
00:25:35,503 --> 00:25:36,830
Speaker 0: So a little bit about this show though.

401
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:40,070
Speaker 0: It's a production IG which is a plus one already.

402
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like, you know studio 4c is plus 10 but production IG is plus a lot.

403
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,823
Speaker 0: Anyway, they did stand-alone complex and it was on no automata and they also did.

404
00:25:48,843 --> 00:25:50,127
Speaker 1: Oh, no, that was all studio 4c.

405
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:50,609
Speaker 1: Nevermind.

406
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,063
Speaker 0: So The director Kenji Kamiyama is actually pretty well known.

407
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,790
Speaker 0: It looks like he worked with Satoshi Konoha bunch.

408
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:59,274
Speaker 0: He worked on minipato Jin ro.

409
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:03,750
Speaker 0: he also happened to direct screenplay and write standalone complex.

410
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,999
Speaker 1: This is a winning bus production IG rights.

411
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:06,662
Speaker 1: He must work there.

412
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:08,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's obviously a winning guy.

413
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,169
Speaker 1: They put the a-team at production IG on this job.

414
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:17,083
Speaker 0: now Sometimes when you say like oh so and so like so and so's show like this guy directed this It's easy to say like.

415
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:17,850
Speaker 0: oh he directed it.

416
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,023
Speaker 0: But all these other people is based on a manga or anything.

417
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:20,989
Speaker 1: just he just wrote it.

418
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:28,230
Speaker 0: He wrote the script the screenplay did the storyboards for a bunch of the episodes was the original creator and the director.

419
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,049
Speaker 1: So who wrote the movies that people supposedly say also him?

420
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,477
Speaker 0: Okay, so this is basically him.

421
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,290
Speaker 0: all the way except for the character designs themselves.

422
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:42,166
Speaker 0: They actually got Chica Umino who did a honey and clover and I love the character designs.

423
00:26:42,407 --> 00:26:43,873
Speaker 1: Okay, they're really good They're pretty good.

424
00:26:43,913 --> 00:26:44,557
Speaker 1: The girls cute.

425
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,205
Speaker 1: Well characters are distinct.

426
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:47,010
Speaker 1: You can tell them apart.

427
00:26:47,291 --> 00:27:07,541
Speaker 0: Saki the main character, you know, the girl who meets the naked guy with a cell phone gun and amnesia is Really cute with like kind of this big cheeks and a wide face with like a wide thin smile And all the characters do this thing which I mean I haven't really read much of honey and clover but Emily's read a lot where they'll like put their hands up in an X and Like make a funny face whenever anything scary happens.

428
00:27:07,822 --> 00:27:09,448
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's a classic thing.

429
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:14,805
Speaker 0: Yeah That's basically the closest to super deformed or anime BS that the show gets to.

430
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:16,090
Speaker 0: it's really cute.

431
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:19,917
Speaker 1: So is this a good show?

432
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,063
Speaker 1: I think it's.

433
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:22,630
Speaker 1: I think it's mostly a good show, right?

434
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,430
Speaker 1: It's like it's not an amazing show like oh my gosh.

435
00:27:25,772 --> 00:27:29,110
Speaker 1: But I think what it is is sort of has a little bit of the Death Note problem, right?

436
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:39,219
Speaker 1: Cuz in Death Note, there's like a two parts of Death Note, you know There's the first half and the second half and the first half is so good that even though the second half I still think is good is not as good as the first half.

437
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:47,025
Speaker 0: the relativity of it makes it seem like the second half Like if I drank a glass of $500 Kings fee and then after it I had $100 Kings fee the $100 Kings fee.

438
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:55,288
Speaker 0: It's still really really really good and expensive and valuable, but I just had the $500 Kings fee.

439
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:56,090
Speaker 0: exactly, right?

440
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:01,790
Speaker 1: So I think the first episode of Eden of the East remember there's only 11 right is a really good episode.

441
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:04,422
Speaker 1: I like you can't have a better first episode of anime.

442
00:28:04,442 --> 00:28:08,861
Speaker 1: that makes me want to see the rest of the show But after that it sort of goes.

443
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,407
Speaker 1: it doesn't go down in the shitter.

444
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:11,210
Speaker 1: It just goes down.

445
00:28:11,451 --> 00:28:14,690
Speaker 1: You know, it's not as it doesn't stick with what it started.

446
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:23,748
Speaker 0: the rest of the show does not give me the same feeling because what I liked about the show and they're mostly in the first episode that one the character is really cute and they react in surprising ways and the plot was interesting.

447
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:31,438
Speaker 0: and aside from all the Johnny's there were a ton of movie references that were kind of integrated with the plot of Eden of the East.

448
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:37,295
Speaker 0: but we're also kind of these meta references and they were all over the place and it just worked really well.

449
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:42,174
Speaker 0: and the kind of budding pseudo romance between Saki and Akira who's the?

450
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:46,010
Speaker 0: you know, the man the naked guy who on nakeds was just really charming.

451
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:55,322
Speaker 0: There's a lot of charm in the first episode and there was charm in the second episode and the charm kind of Went away and got replaced by a solid B anime.

452
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:58,923
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it had kept the charm up It would have been a B plus a minus.

453
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:06,470
Speaker 1: Yes The problem was is how do you keep up the charm while also making progress on this dark intriguing?

454
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:08,530
Speaker 1: You know sci-fi plot, right?

455
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,144
Speaker 1: It's like they when they started to investigate like the parts with the doctor.

456
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:13,550
Speaker 1: That was pretty awesome.

457
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:21,423
Speaker 1: But then when they got further into the parts with the Johnny thief and the hacking fat guy You know, I guess the hacking fat guy had a little bit of charm.

458
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:23,972
Speaker 0: So there's a guy in the show Itazu.

459
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:24,936
Speaker 0: they call him pants cuz.

460
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:26,684
Speaker 0: the kanji of his name could also be right everywhere.

461
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:27,488
Speaker 1: He never wears pants.

462
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:27,990
Speaker 1: He's rim.

463
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:39,060
Speaker 0: Well, he used to wear pants and he became a hikikomori because one day he was sitting, you know He just graduated he wasn't doing so well in life and his pants were hanging up to dry and they blew away And he never left the house again.

464
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,247
Speaker 1: You only had one pair of pants.

465
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:40,629
Speaker 1: That was it.

466
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:53,410
Speaker 0: He didn't have any others but to his credit He's the hikikomori scary dude, and when you finally meet him in the show and they show him to you He's fat and disgusting But at the same time he is a legitimate awesome smart hacker.

467
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:54,190
Speaker 1: He's not you know.

468
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:07,198
Speaker 1: I think it's actually a pretty good portrayal of a hikikomori right because a lot of the portrayals You see like in welcome to NHK or whatever are Perhaps too realistic Scary people you'd never want to be around.

469
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:09,930
Speaker 1: but this guy it's like he's actually not a bad guy.

470
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,830
Speaker 1: He's not really bad or evil or freaky or disgusting.

471
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:17,146
Speaker 1: He's just a guy who doesn't go outside, but is otherwise.

472
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:17,990
Speaker 1: he's a smart hacker.

473
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:24,160
Speaker 1: He's fat just because he doesn't go anywhere not because you know, and it's like, you know It's like I at first like I didn't want.

474
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,030
Speaker 1: you know, I'm not gonna like hikikomori character.

475
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,378
Speaker 1: I can be like all day get him away.

476
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:30,360
Speaker 1: But you know, I kind of was like hey I could do it This guy is alright.

477
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:31,189
Speaker 1: I'm with this guy.

478
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:37,146
Speaker 1: But yeah, at least that part of the show though, even though the character was alright, it was dragon.

479
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,250
Speaker 0: because it got a little too.

480
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:44,816
Speaker 0: Death node II almost like it started getting into all the procedural Bs of the mystery.

481
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:48,350
Speaker 0: Yeah and look at something that ghost in the shell standalone complex first gig.

482
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:51,921
Speaker 0: The main mystery was hardly addressed in most of the episodes.

483
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:53,525
Speaker 0: There was individually awesome.

484
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:57,836
Speaker 0: Yes, they stood alone From the complex episodes.

485
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:01,790
Speaker 1: Well, I mean with only 11 episodes you've kind of got to use every episode.

486
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:02,332
Speaker 1: But

487
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:19,470
Speaker 0: at the same time unlike Death Note while it's doing this procedural stuff The Akira is kind of hiding a lot of information from probably the only person in the world He can actually trust to help him out Which doesn't really make a lot of sense both for his character and for the charm of the first episode.

488
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:21,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, also they they don't.

489
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:26,150
Speaker 1: it's like they give the viewer a lot of information, but they don't give you all the details.

490
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:30,185
Speaker 1: So even after the whole show is over you still have like all these question marks.

491
00:31:30,245 --> 00:31:38,450
Speaker 0: that is just like, all right Worse they give all this information to you and to him but not to sake who is arguably the main character.

492
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:47,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of it's like even though she is technically the main character like she's actually getting less screen time as the sucks because I wanted her to be more.

493
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:50,724
Speaker 0: the Interaction between her and Akira was like the best part of the show.

494
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,010
Speaker 1: That's what the show is supposed to be about.

495
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,376
Speaker 1: That was what the first episode was.

496
00:31:53,396 --> 00:31:53,597
Speaker 0: Yep.

497
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:56,430
Speaker 0: And then the second best part of the show was him fucks in with the phone.

498
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

499
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:58,699
Speaker 1: So here how about this?

500
00:31:58,779 --> 00:31:58,960
Speaker 1: right?

501
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,450
Speaker 1: so they bring in when they go back to Japan, right?

502
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,662
Speaker 1: There's all those like sake's friends like the club.

503
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:04,124
Speaker 1: She's in.

504
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,693
Speaker 0: I hate all of them Why don't know.

505
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:07,322
Speaker 1: but like what is their club that they're?

506
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:08,570
Speaker 1: what is their club trying to do?

507
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,896
Speaker 1: Aren't they like they have a goal?

508
00:32:09,936 --> 00:32:11,142
Speaker 0: or they were trying to form a company?

509
00:32:11,203 --> 00:32:12,590
Speaker 0: remember and then it didn't do so.

510
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,359
Speaker 0: Well, and then but it's John I love this character.

511
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,927
Speaker 0: She's like a cute nerdy cute girl.

512
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:18,850
Speaker 0: Who's also a hacker?

513
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,175
Speaker 1: What about the guy who lives in the desk?

514
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:22,222
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah that guy never mind.

515
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:24,170
Speaker 0: cuz we just watched Sanjuro not that long ago.

516
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:25,980
Speaker 0: He reminded me the guy who hid in the closet.

517
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:27,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, who would open the door and say something.

518
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,596
Speaker 0: They're like good point.

519
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:30,067
Speaker 0: and then he's like back into the closet.

520
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:35,710
Speaker 1: I go But the thing is is that it's like where that came out of nowhere.

521
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:39,230
Speaker 1: It's like suddenly she's at this club and they were doing something and there was no explanation.

522
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:44,690
Speaker 1: Like we I'm in a club and we were you know, it would have been fine except that then that club.

523
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,557
Speaker 0: So I was confused way too much.

524
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:48,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wasn't confused for like 10 minutes of like.

525
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:49,850
Speaker 1: who are these people?

526
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,913
Speaker 1: What are they doing?

527
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:52,401
Speaker 1: What relation do they have to the characters?

528
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,109
Speaker 1: already know they just didn't explain it all.

529
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:02,623
Speaker 1: They just went right into it and it took me like at least an episode and a half to figure out like what the fuck These people about it was almost going in an interesting.

530
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:10,810
Speaker 0: so important because you know Saki has this adventure with this mysterious guy and they have this kind of really interesting and charming interaction.

531
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,170
Speaker 0: And then the show's following that and it's good.

532
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:29,550
Speaker 0: And then it has a kind of Frodo situation where she's had this experience and she can't go back to normal life and they dwell on that for a little while and Then it just kind of drops that thread when actually that was that thread would have kept the show better than the phone thread.

533
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,796
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is right.

534
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,890
Speaker 1: if you that's a good thread, you know can't go back to the normal life.

535
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:38,569
Speaker 1: But if you look at Frodo, right, they save that thread for the end.

536
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:48,453
Speaker 0: While they save that thread for the end Frodo doesn't go back to Hobbiton halfway through the books and just like putts around for a couple of chapters Exactly.

537
00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:49,901
Speaker 1: He goes back to Hobbiton at the end.

538
00:33:49,921 --> 00:33:51,710
Speaker 0: Saki goes back to her normal life.

539
00:33:51,971 --> 00:34:00,301
Speaker 0: She has her Frodo moment for like two episodes and then just goes back to the club and the club's really important because they made Google goggles, why is that Google goggles thing even there?

540
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,890
Speaker 1: That is that's like what their company was trying to make, right?

541
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,844
Speaker 1: They were trying to make Google goggles and sell it.

542
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:11,330
Speaker 0: That was their product Yeah, but the fact that that mattered so much just did not jive with what I liked about the show.

543
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:13,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like what this case this thing came out of nowhere.

544
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:16,735
Speaker 1: these characters came out of nowhere And you know, it's like.

545
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:19,748
Speaker 1: I don't think he planned out the whole thing before he started.

546
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,650
Speaker 0: Of course the tertiary con didn't plan out paranoia agent.

547
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:24,217
Speaker 1: So yeah, but I mean he didn't plan the end.

548
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:25,201
Speaker 1: this guy didn't play the middle.

549
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,070
Speaker 0: and really what is it with the word Johnny?

550
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:28,429
Speaker 0: Why did they use the word Johnny?

551
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:33,870
Speaker 0: They don't know any other words so much to refer to both penises and skeleton otaku aliens?

552
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:34,592
Speaker 1: I don't know.

553
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:35,315
Speaker 0: remember.

554
00:34:35,335 --> 00:34:38,550
Speaker 0: the skeleton otaku alien shoves his head like up the guy's shirt.

555
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:41,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, I promise the show is not as weird as I'm making it out to be.

556
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,590
Speaker 1: I would say some things about the ending of the show, but I know you didn't let watch the last two episodes yet.

557
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:46,735
Speaker 0: Yep, we don't want to spoil it.

558
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:49,110
Speaker 0: We'll eventually review the movies that people say they're terrible.

559
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:53,810
Speaker 0: I don't know, but once I finish the show we'll do a spoiler episode.

560
00:34:55,271 --> 00:34:57,398
Speaker 1: The end of the show the last two episodes.

561
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:00,828
Speaker 1: they answer one of these questions right that you have but it's not.

562
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,350
Speaker 1: it's like.

563
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:06,730
Speaker 1: You know, sometimes there'll be things that are unexplained and there'll be things that are you know mysteries, right?

564
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,957
Speaker 1: and you actively want to know them and They don't answer all of them.

565
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:13,910
Speaker 1: And in fact, they answer one that was a mystery.

566
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,710
Speaker 1: It was an unknown but you weren't even asking it or thinking about it, but they answer it and that's the big reveal.

567
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:23,704
Speaker 1: It's like oh, come on Why did you give me something I cared about like who is the supporter?

568
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:24,326
Speaker 1: or something like?

569
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:25,009
Speaker 0: they tell you who?

570
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:27,877
Speaker 0: mr Altas I'd always it's guys.

571
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:28,419
Speaker 1: it though.

572
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:29,903
Speaker 1: It was that's a question that you're asking.

573
00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:32,070
Speaker 1: So then it's not something to answer.

574
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:37,553
Speaker 0: It's something you're actively questioning to sake and Akira Get together.

575
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:42,830
Speaker 1: if it's something that you're actively questioning like I really want to know this then they don't answer.

576
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:48,410
Speaker 0: But if it's something they're gonna be like the cell phones were powered by nuclear power, you know, the battery was infinite.

577
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:48,952
Speaker 1: You know how.

578
00:35:48,992 --> 00:35:53,227
Speaker 1: there's things you know, you don't know and there's things you don't know.

579
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:53,870
Speaker 1: you don't know.

580
00:35:54,492 --> 00:35:55,698
Speaker 1: It's one of the things you don't know.

581
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:56,381
Speaker 1: you don't know.

582
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:58,953
Speaker 1: not one of the things you know, you don't know Huh?

583
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:00,744
Speaker 0: Like why do you get rid of his memory?

584
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,629
Speaker 0: or how or what the fuck?

585
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,456
Speaker 1: Here's the priority you can't.

586
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:04,762
Speaker 1: it's something you think it up.

587
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:10,609
Speaker 0: So it's always gonna be this one thing funny I mean you kind of find out that he erased his own memory like they get to that pretty quick.

588
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:17,150
Speaker 0: and then the question that two episodes before the end has not been answered yet is What was his plan?

589
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:27,186
Speaker 0: He erased his own memory and left himself on purpose naked with a gun and a cell phone in front of the White House And somehow that was supposed to further his plan.

590
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:30,789
Speaker 0: Yeah Does that get answered?

591
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,275
Speaker 1: Maybe he's just being selfish.

592
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:36,384
Speaker 1: I wanted to get away from whatever horrible things.

593
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:37,970
Speaker 0: He knew his dog is really cute.

594
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,209
Speaker 1: It's actually a Galaxy Express episode about that.

595
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:49,239
Speaker 1: You know where there was a. I mean a Galaxy Express a Galaxy Railways or episode where they go to this planet where there's a Some kind of elf creature that steals memories.

596
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:52,130
Speaker 1: So it's like this is lady who's like, oh, please steal my memories.

597
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,838
Speaker 1: They're so horrible and the other people like.

598
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,330
Speaker 1: I don't want you to lose any memories no matter how horrible they are.

599
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,555
Speaker 1: They're mine, you know.

600
00:36:57,616 --> 00:37:00,749
Speaker 0: and that kind of message, you know, there's an a on flux episode about that, too.

601
00:37:01,192 --> 00:37:02,880
Speaker 0: Ah, it's actually a really good episode.

602
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:03,504
Speaker 0: Very interesting.

603
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:03,845
Speaker 1: Yeah.

604
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:04,589
Speaker 1: All right.

605
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:13,981
Speaker 0: So all in all the show is like a solid B show Like I'm enjoying it about as much as I enjoyed like scrap princess Let's say standard B to watch.

606
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:14,966
Speaker 1: why not go for it?

607
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:16,633
Speaker 0: pros I mean the show.

608
00:37:16,713 --> 00:37:18,620
Speaker 0: the characters are really cute and really good.

609
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,550
Speaker 0: The first two episodes are just incredibly charming.

610
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:32,786
Speaker 0: Just don't be disappointed too much when that awesome like charming interaction with the characters the cute dog with the wings Just kind of takes the back burner to this club and Osugi and all these other characters.

611
00:37:32,806 --> 00:37:37,890
Speaker 0: You really don't care about Mm-hmm, and then the plot gets kind of Death Note II but not in a good way.

612
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:41,260
Speaker 0: He doesn't just call chewy stuff like.

613
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:47,280
Speaker 0: he does things that spend his money to solve problems When there were probably much better ways to go about that.

614
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:53,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, he makes a lot of really dumb mistakes Yeah, and the show kind of protects him from that.

615
00:37:53,610 --> 00:38:00,010
Speaker 1: I would have almost rather seen a show where it was like what would happen if you got me like got the telephone.

616
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:03,580
Speaker 1: I just do the same exact thing.

617
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,703
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

618
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:07,070
Speaker 0: That's a fanfic someone should make fuck.

619
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:09,863
Speaker 1: Dueling telephone.

620
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:14,395
Speaker 1: I Know have two phones Daddy, two phones.

621
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:15,740
Speaker 1: I'll make a fake phone.

622
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,370
Speaker 1: It looks like the phone but isn't the phone?

623
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:20,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, so back to the opener.

624
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:24,704
Speaker 0: though I I really like the opener partly because it's a good like it has.

625
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:28,499
Speaker 0: it really is Telling you the what the plot is.

626
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:36,399
Speaker 0: the whole noblesse obligé thing Like it fits the plot really well kind of like how the gundam seed Opener told you the entire plot.

627
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:38,649
Speaker 1: if you paid attention the gundam seed openers are the best.

628
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:40,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were this.

629
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:44,807
Speaker 0: this gave me the same feel in terms of it was relevant and independently good.

630
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:45,509
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

631
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:50,869
Speaker 0: And there's that one quote that really stands out what the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power.

632
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:53,461
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm in the beginner, you know in the opener.

633
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:57,485
Speaker 0: All right, you don't remember that It kind of is really important.

634
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:59,836
