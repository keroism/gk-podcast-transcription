1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,640
Speaker 0: So, you might have noticed that there's not one, but two episodes in the feed for tonight.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,760
Speaker 0: Well, the deal is, and this hasn't happened in a long time.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,300
Speaker 0: We used to generate a lot of outtakes, but now, not so many.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,460
Speaker 0: Scott and I, in the middle of the FPS key bindings show, got into a little bit of argument, partly that Scott started it.

5
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,799
Speaker 0: I'll blame him entirely, because he's not here to defend himself.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:33,180
Speaker 0: And as a result, we argued for a good 15 minutes about moving furniture and putting spices and food and non-conformism and all this crap when we were just trying to talk about FPS key bindings.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,240
Speaker 0: So, instead of having an hour-and-change-long episode with that stuck in the middle of it, well, I just kind of cut it out like a little tumor.

8
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:45,639
Speaker 0: And you know how when you go to the surgery and they cut out a gallstone or whatever, they always let you keep it.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,300
Speaker 0: At least, they used to let you keep it in a little jar.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,620
Speaker 0: Well, I kept that argument in a little jar, and I decided that, wait, we've always said, you know, we'll put in extra shows to make up for shows we've missed.

11
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:57,658
Speaker 0: And this is probably the first extra show we've ever put up.

12
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:04,739
Speaker 0: If this is your first time listening to Geek Nights, I'm going to note, as we always note, that this is not a normal episode of Geek Nights.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,040
Speaker 0: This is what we like to call a special.

14
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:16,640
Speaker 0: So if you've never listened before, you're welcome to listen to this, but I would highly recommend you check out any episode in our entire feed that does not contain the word "special" in the title.

15
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,339
Speaker 0: That's a much better picture of what this show is.

16
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:21,560
Speaker 0: This is entirely unedited.

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,400
Speaker 0: I didn't really do anything to it except apply my normal high-pass filters and whatever.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:38,140
Speaker 0: Enjoy it or not, a lot of you have been asking for more arguments from us, so I can say with certainty that this is pretty much a straight-up, unedited, exactly how Scott and I argue pretty much every day of our lives.

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,599
Speaker 0: We just happen to have been sitting in front of the microphones when we started this one.

20
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:51,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the way you have your things arranged, like your bed at the foot facing the desk next to the wall over there, this is not a typical furniture arrangement.

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,900
Speaker 0: All right, so it's not maybe, you know, white-bred, American, midwest...

22
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:56,460
Speaker 1: See, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,957
Speaker 1: You always seem to have this attitude that if something is white-bred American, it's somehow bad.

24
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,918
Speaker 1: Or if something is the accepted default, the way that a lot of people do something, then it must be bad because...

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,420
Speaker 0: Now, now, Scott, I don't want to bring up logical fallacies here, but you are begging the question.

26
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:12,839
Speaker 1: How am I begging the question?

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,838
Speaker 0: Because you've jumped to the conclusion that because I somehow, in this one instance, used some setup that isn't somehow typical of standing...

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,460
Speaker 1: You do this often.

29
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,100
Speaker 1: You do often say, with food also, you're like, "Eh, it's such a white-bred American food.

30
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:27,740
Speaker 1: It's no good.

31
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,538
Speaker 1: You gotta, you know, you toss all sorts of weird spices in the

32
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:30,779
Speaker 1: food.".

33
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:31,660
Speaker 0: Wait, wait a minute.

34
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,740
Speaker 0: You're saying that I'm bad because I put spices in my food.

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,020
Speaker 1: No, not because you put spice in your food, because you are not a cook yet when you cook.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,520
Speaker 1: You just sort of pick spices and you toss them in there, not according to any recipe or any cooking knowledge.

37
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,440
Speaker 0: Actually, I do it according to all the websites that I write about how to use all those spices.

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:46,880
Speaker 0: You know what?

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,599
Speaker 0: It works pretty well.

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,660
Speaker 1: You know, because you used to do that before you read any websites about spice.

41
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,858
Speaker 1: You've been doing that since RIT.

42
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,679
Speaker 0: When I started reading those websites.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,977
Speaker 1: No, you didn't read any websites.

44
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:58,540
Speaker 0: Like, I read all the uses for dill, and I started using it.

45
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,780
Speaker 0: I used dill and ham, and I used dill on grilled cheese sandwiches, and I used dill and eggs.

46
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:04,138
Speaker 0: Any savory dish.

47
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,679
Speaker 0: Then I looked up how to use oregano.

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,959
Speaker 0: Then I looked up how to use cilantro and all those things.

49
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:13,520
Speaker 1: You just like to do things that are not what is standard.

50
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:16,420
Speaker 1: You are a non-conformist, in a way.

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,840
Speaker 0: So wait a minute, wait a minute.

52
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:19,220
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

53
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,137
Speaker 0: This is what begs the question.

54
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:30,158
Speaker 0: You seem to say that somehow I do it intentionally for the intent of being different, as opposed to, like in the case of my room, I had a rational reason that-

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:42,658
Speaker 1: No, but you seem to, whether you admit it or not, you seem to have this attitude that the way that is not conforming is superior, or that the conformist way cannot possibly be the best way.

56
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,840
Speaker 0: But that's not true at all.

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,840
Speaker 0: Conforming or non-conforming has nothing to do with the end utility.

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,600
Speaker 1: That is correct.

59
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,880
Speaker 1: And yet, you seem to behave in contrast with that very thing.

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,400
Speaker 0: See, Scott, you seem to have this problem, because you accuse me of this a lot.

61
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,840
Speaker 0: If I like a wine, Scott always says, "Ah, you just like the idea of wine.

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,860
Speaker 0: You don't actually like wine.

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,349
Speaker 0: It tastes like

64
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:01,655
Speaker 0: crap.".

65
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:04,400
Speaker 0: Or, "You don't actually like the taste of alcohol.

66
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:05,172
Speaker 0: You just want to get

67
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:05,437
Speaker 0: drunk.".

68
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:10,100
Speaker 0: Or, "You don't actually like the taste of that fancy cheese versus that unfancy cheese or whatever.

69
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:14,166
Speaker 0: You just like the idea of liking the fancy French cheese instead of the weird American cheese or

70
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:14,532
Speaker 0: whatever.".

71
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:22,040
Speaker 1: But I really do like those things, and I don't know- You came to like them after originally having the idea that you would like them.

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,020
Speaker 1: See, not at all.

73
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,345
Speaker 1: Yeah.

74
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,199
Speaker 0: I'd like you to back that up.

75
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:30,379
Speaker 1: It's not something I can prove, it's just something I observed living with you, and there's no way I could prove it to anyone else.

76
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,559
Speaker 1: Because- No one else has lived with you.

77
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,000
Speaker 0: I like the taste of wine, so I buy wine.

78
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,059
Speaker 0: I like the taste of cheese, so I buy the cheeses I like.

79
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,100
Speaker 0: I like the taste of spices, so I buy the spices I like.

80
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:45,380
Speaker 1: Why do you buy the fancy, weird wines that are not common?

81
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:46,698
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

82
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:47,980
Speaker 0: What fancy, weird wine?

83
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,774
Speaker 0: Most of the wines I buy are the $9 specials.

84
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:57,557
Speaker 0: The only special bottle of wine I have is a bottle of port that was given to me as a gift, and I haven't opened it.

85
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:02,720
Speaker 1: Why don't you drink just like whatever most people drink, just like default stuff?

86
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,339
Speaker 0: Like what?

87
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:05,260
Speaker 1: I don't know, because I don't know anything about wine.

88
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:11,998
Speaker 0: The default wines, I guess, that most people drink are, I don't know, Chardonnays and California wines and Merlots, which I drink all the time.

89
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:15,640
Speaker 0: Most of my wine is super cheap.

90
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,060
Speaker 1: But you won't eat American cheese.

91
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,719
Speaker 0: Because American cheese is really bland.

92
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,798
Speaker 1: You won't drink Budweiser.

93
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,460
Speaker 0: Because Budweiser is really flavorless and watery and crappy.

94
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:30,140
Speaker 0: It has nothing to do with any factor other than the fact that Budweiser, to me, tastes like crap.

95
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:37,400
Speaker 1: What things do you like are super conformist as Budweiser and American cheese?

96
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,375
Speaker 0: I really like Dr.

97
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:38,680
Speaker 0: Pepper.

98
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:39,303
Speaker 1: Dr.

99
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:41,895
Speaker 1: Pepper's, but see, that's not, Dr.

100
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:42,940
Speaker 1: Pepper's the weird one out.

101
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:43,768
Speaker 0: How is Dr.

102
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:44,700
Speaker 0: Pepper the weird one out?

103
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,599
Speaker 1: It's like Coke and Pepsi are the mainstays.

104
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,399
Speaker 1: Those are the white bread mainstream ones.

105
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:49,922
Speaker 1: Dr.

106
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:51,579
Speaker 1: Pepper's the third offshoot one.

107
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,959
Speaker 0: Because those are colas.

108
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:53,965
Speaker 0: Dr.

109
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,140
Speaker 0: Pepper's not really a cola.

110
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,020
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, you don't like anything.

111
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,929
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, because I like Dr.

112
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,876
Speaker 0: Pepper instead of Coke, somehow I'm a non-conformist and I only like Dr.

113
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:02,020
Speaker 0: Pepper.

114
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:06,600
Speaker 1: What do you like, what do you do that could be considered conformist in any way?

115
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:07,136
Speaker 0: I don't know.

116
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:08,298
Speaker 0: I own a car.

117
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:09,659
Speaker 0: I drive places.

118
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:11,819
Speaker 0: Sometimes I take trains.

119
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,600
Speaker 0: I like sandwiches.

120
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:20,940
Speaker 1: You don't ever order like the normal sandwich, you always get a sandwich with as many extra things on it as you can.

121
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,219
Speaker 0: What do you mean like a normal sandwich?

122
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,739
Speaker 0: Today for lunch, I had a ham and turkey sandwich with mustard, lettuce, tomato, and onion on white bread.

123
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,300
Speaker 1: White bread, you said?

124
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:29,426
Speaker 1: Yes.

125
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,340
Speaker 1: Wonder bread?

126
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,460
Speaker 0: No, it was the white roll that they had at the sub place.

127
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,000
Speaker 1: Ah, so it's a roll, not a white bread.

128
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,659
Speaker 1: When was the last time you ate white bread?

129
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:42,340
Speaker 0: A few weeks ago when I bought some white bread.

130
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,380
Speaker 1: You bought white bread?

131
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,920
Speaker 0: It was white Italian bread and it had sesame seeds in it.

132
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,740
Speaker 0: Oh, so the sesame seeds make me a non-conformist.

133
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,300
Speaker 1: Zane, would you ever buy a white Wonder Bread?

134
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:53,676
Speaker 0: Wonder Bread tastes like ass.

135
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:55,479
Speaker 1: Ah, again.

136
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,700
Speaker 1: You always buy the weirdest non-conforming bread you can buy.

137
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,819
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, so buying the Italian bread is weirdest non-conformist as opposed to the nasty ass Wonder Bread?

138
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,333
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, you refuse- Scott, Scott, Scott, would you eat Wonder Bread?

139
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:10,380
Speaker 0: because I've had Wonder Bread before and I know what it tastes like.

140
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,338
Speaker 0: There's a reason I avoid it.

141
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:13,000
Speaker 0: How come you don't buy the Wonder Bread?

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,060
Speaker 1: Because I don't like the taste of it.

143
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:15,780
Speaker 0: Oh, so you're a non-conformist.

144
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:23,240
Speaker 1: You buy the fancy weird bread because you don't want to- No, I don't buy wheat bread, but I don't go out of my way to get the weirder bread.

145
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:33,960
Speaker 1: When you go to the bread store, you have to buy, I see you looking at all the breads and you go to the breads that are like the most oddball breads on purpose, intentionally.

146
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:36,920
Speaker 0: Do you ever think that maybe honey oat bread tastes really good?

147
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,072
Speaker 1: See, but that's the thing, is you go for it like, "Ah, here's the good breads," as to say that the plain old wheat bread is no good.

148
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:46,340
Speaker 1: while the wheat bread is awesome, the plain wheat bread is hot.

149
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,580
Speaker 0: But you're begging the question.

150
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,940
Speaker 1: What question am I begging?

151
00:07:49,240 --> 00:08:01,400
Speaker 0: You're assuming a lot here and you're kind of skipping to the conclusion that honey wheat bread or honey oat bread, which is my favorite kind of bread in the world, I somehow like it for some reason other than the fact that it tastes like honey.

152
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:07,100
Speaker 1: Well, the first time you bought honey wheat bread or honey oat bread or whatever, right?

153
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,560
Speaker 0: You know what I thought the first time I saw honey oat bread?

154
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,740
Speaker 0: I remember somewhat clearly.

155
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,460
Speaker 0: I thought, "Wow, I really like honey and I really like oats.

156
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,199
Speaker 0: Here's a bread made out of honey and oats.

157
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:17,770
Speaker 0: Hot shit, I'm buying

158
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:17,992
Speaker 0: this.".

159
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:27,379
Speaker 1: But yeah, you always try, everything you like is a non-conforming, most out of the park thing.

160
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,240
Speaker 1: Back that up at all.

161
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,379
Speaker 1: What do you like?

162
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:31,852
Speaker 1: Name a single thing you like.

163
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:33,019
Speaker 1: that is a conforming thing.

164
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:40,940
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here, because- While you agree that because something is- Beer, all right?

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,599
Speaker 0: You brought up beer.

166
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,919
Speaker 0: I think Coors and Budweiser taste like shit, but you know what?

167
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,180
Speaker 0: I like Labatt Blue and I like Red Stripe a lot.

168
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,819
Speaker 0: Red Stripe's one of my favorite beers.

169
00:08:52,341 --> 00:09:07,388
Speaker 1: I'm just saying is you, while you agree that something is not better because it is non-conformist, you behave and act in a way in where you tend to approve more of things which do not conform and you go

170
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:09,779
Speaker 0: out of your way- But you haven't backed that part up at all.

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:19,759
Speaker 1: To consume and patronize things and behave in such a way that it is as far from the norm or as far from what you believe is the norm of America as you possibly can.

172
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,960
Speaker 0: But that's not true at all.

173
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,937
Speaker 1: But that's what you do.

174
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,839
Speaker 0: But you haven't backed that up at all.

175
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,099
Speaker 0: In fact, I grew up in the Midwest, right?

176
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:29,999
Speaker 0: I put ketchup on my eggs.

177
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,738
Speaker 1: That's weird.

178
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,538
Speaker 0: How is that weird?

179
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,678
Speaker 1: That's weird.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,479
Speaker 0: You realize that everyone there does that?

181
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:36,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird.

182
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,179
Speaker 0: I put salt on my watermelon like people do.

183
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:39,819
Speaker 1: That's also weird.

184
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:40,760
Speaker 0: That's what you're supposed to do.

185
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,260
Speaker 0: It tastes better.

186
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,999
Speaker 1: No, you're not supposed to do that.

187
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,296
Speaker 1: Yes.

188
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,566
Speaker 1: No.

189
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:45,900
Speaker 1: All right, anyway, let's go back to the FPS in there.

190
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:49,780
Speaker 0: I don't know if I can because apparently I'm such a non-conformist.

191
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,865
Speaker 0: I think I got to break the-.

192
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:54,357
Speaker 0: if you're going to put this label on me, then I guess I got to go with it.

193
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,189
Speaker 1: Yeah.

194
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,060
Speaker 0: I'll be like Anime Pulse.

195
00:09:59,044 --> 00:09:59,500
Speaker 0: So go ahead.

196
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,515
Speaker 0: Talk about your FPS-ing.

197
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:01,398
Speaker 0: All right.

198
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,213
Speaker 0: Chicken.

199
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:09,038
Speaker 0: So- Interrupting guy.

200
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:11,387
Speaker 1: An otaku generation.

201
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:13,680
Speaker 1: that was an interrupting guy, I listened to it today, but I couldn't.

202
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,999
Speaker 0: Why were you listening to Otaku?

203
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:20,140
Speaker 1: Otaku Generation is like the worst podcast- I said that I would listen to any Otakon report.

204
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:21,700
Speaker 1: I'll talk about this later.

205
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,499
Speaker 0: That was a mistake.

206
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,460
Speaker 1: All right, let's go back- You know what?

207
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,791
Speaker 0: I think I'm going to review them first.

208
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:27,740
Speaker 0: next time we do a Geekbot.

209
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,617
Speaker 1: All right, let's go back now.

210
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:29,640
Speaker 0: Back to what?

211
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,519
Speaker 0: I'm a non-conformist.

212
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,720
Speaker 0: I'm just letting it free flow here.

213
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,659
Speaker 0: I'm like Fast Karate.

214
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:34,839
Speaker 0: It's your fault.

215
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:37,619
Speaker 1: Can we do the episode now?

216
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:38,800
Speaker 0: Maybe.

217
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:41,639
Speaker 0: We'll see where the non-conformity takes me.

218
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:45,500
Speaker 1: Are we actually going to do the episode or what?

219
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,137
Speaker 0: That's up to you.

220
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:47,640
Speaker 1: Am I a non-conformist?

221
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,700
Speaker 1: I'm ready to do it or are you going to be the interrupting guy?

222
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,100
Speaker 0: Am I a non-conformist, Scott?

223
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,778
Speaker 0: Yes, you are.

224
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:56,156
Speaker 0: Am I a non-conformist for reasons other than the fact that that just happens to be the things that I like?

225
00:10:57,701 --> 00:11:08,040
Speaker 1: I think that yes, but you have successfully come up with a indefeatable argument in where I cannot successfully argue that that is the truth.

226
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,460
Speaker 0: But you didn't even defeat my primary argument, so it doesn't really matter that you can't defeat my bullshit argument.

227
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Speaker 1: I'm saying that's the way it is, but your argument saying you are not is foolproof because there's no way to prove what is in your mind.

228
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:22,500
Speaker 0: My argument- But that's not even my argument.

229
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,900
Speaker 0: My argument was that you didn't have any evidence at all.

230
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,759
Speaker 1: I have evidence.

231
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:28,300
Speaker 0: All you did was beg the question and jump to conclusions.

232
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:44,720
Speaker 1: You go out, you do, I observe that you go out of your way to do things in a non-conforming fashion and behave in a way that gives people around you the idea that you approve of things which do not conform more than you approve of things that do conform.

233
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,856
Speaker 0: That's quite a statement and I noticed that you haven't backed it up with any single shred of evidence.

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Speaker 1: That is what I observe living with you.

235
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,259
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

236
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,760
Speaker 0: So all you've got is anecdotes and you don't even have anecdotes.

237
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,200
Speaker 0: You have one assertion with no backing.

238
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,980
Speaker 1: Because I don't remember my specific observations, but I lived with you long enough.

239
00:12:04,402 --> 00:12:05,420
Speaker 1: What else do you want me to do here?

240
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,540
Speaker 1: It's not like a scientific- Potatoes!

241
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:06,820
Speaker 0: Chicken!

242
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:07,712
Speaker 1: Chicken!

243
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,719
Speaker 1: Are we done here?

244
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:09,757
Speaker 1: I'm tired of this.

245
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:12,860
Speaker 0: Alright, go ahead.

246
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,240
Speaker 0: Talk about your FPS crap.

247
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,360
Speaker 1: Are you going to do your chicken?

248
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:15,748
Speaker 0: Maybe.

249
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:17,940
Speaker 0: Just go ahead.

250
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,700
Speaker 0: Let's see what happens.

251
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,900
Speaker 0: Like I said, this is free flow.

252
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:25,358
Speaker 0: Did I break you?

253
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:29,300
Speaker 1: I just wanted to go back to the FPS show.

254
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:30,979
Speaker 0: I don't even care about that anymore.

255
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,777
Speaker 0: What the hell?

256
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Speaker 0: Because I already did my piece.

257
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,800
Speaker 0: I already got my say out.

258
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,060
Speaker 0: I already gave everyone my say.

259
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:38,780
Speaker 0: In fact, I have more.

260
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,559
Speaker 0: I could keep talking.

261
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:42,959
Speaker 0: About that keyboard that I wrote stuff all over.

262
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:45,580
Speaker 0: I had the overlay for my own keyboard.

263
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,168
Speaker 0: Yeah.

264
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:46,840
Speaker 1: Great.

265
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:48,019
Speaker 0: Alright, go on.

266
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,336
Speaker 0: Talk about your boring FPSs.

267
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,500
Speaker 0: I don't want to win any more arguments tonight.

268
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,291
Speaker 0: Scott!

269
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:56,399
Speaker 0: Do the show!

270
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,239
Speaker 0: How come you keep laughing?

271
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,800
Speaker 1: Because I'm not done laughing yet and because I know you're going to interrupt.

272
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,860
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for you to do the show.

273
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,576
Speaker 0: I won't interrupt you.

274
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:03,780
Speaker 1: Alright.

275
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:04,838
Speaker 0: Just don't laugh.

276
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,379
Speaker 0: Can you keep from laughing?

277
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,040
Speaker 1: I don't know.

278
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,100
Speaker 1: Where are we going to cut off that and- I'm waiting.

279
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:11,958
Speaker 0: Do the show.

280
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:12,696
Speaker 1: Go on.

281
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:15,980
Speaker 1: Why are you all intentionally trying to mess me up, Barry?

282
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:18,452
Speaker 0: How am I intentionally trying to-?

283
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:19,840
Speaker 0: Now I'll play those arguments.

284
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:23,160
Speaker 0: All I'm doing is asking you to continue the show like you wanted.

285
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,038
Speaker 0: I'm giving you everything.

286
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,178
Speaker 1: No, but you're all like, "Come on.

287
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,199
Speaker 1: Continue the show.

288
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:26,446
Speaker 1: Come

289
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:26,593
Speaker 1: on.".

290
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:30,760
Speaker 1: In a way that implies that you are not going to continue the show as normal.

291
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,960
Speaker 0: So what you're saying is that simply by my tone of voice, I can prevent you from continuing the show from both bits of laughter?

292
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,940
Speaker 1: No, you can't prevent me from continuing the show.

293
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,939
Speaker 0: Because you keep cracking up.

294
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,480
Speaker 1: But I am hesitant to continue the show because I think that you are going to not go through with it and that I'll have to restart again.

295
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,240
Speaker 0: But the thing is, you're reading into a lot of stuff because the words I said were that I will not interrupt you and I'll let you continue the show the moment you start.

296
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:55,991
Speaker 1: All right.

297
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:57,600
Speaker 1: So you're not kidding?

298
00:13:57,841 --> 00:13:58,798
Speaker 0: I'm not going to interrupt you.

299
00:13:59,341 --> 00:13:59,779
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

300
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,460
Speaker 0: It's free flow, but I'm going to let you flow for a while.

301
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,119
Speaker 1: I think you're going to screw something up.

302
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,837
Speaker 0: Well, go ahead.

303
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,879
Speaker 0: The onus is entirely on you.

304
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,512
Speaker 1: The onus.

305
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,420
Speaker 1: Well, you're looking- smiling.

306
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:15,399
Speaker 1: How long has this been?

307
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,138
Speaker 0: You don't have a problem here, Scott.

308
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:19,240
Speaker 1: You're making a problem on purpose.

309
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,399
Speaker 1: Did you take some drugs before I got home?

310
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:22,540
Speaker 0: You just keep laughing.

311
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,319
Speaker 0: Just do the show.

312
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,212
Speaker 1: All right.

313
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,760
Speaker 1: Wow, this hasn't happened in a long time.

314
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:36,680
Speaker 0: I'm not actually doing anything, guys.

315
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:37,759
Speaker 0: I'm really just sitting here.

316
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,800
Speaker 1: And no, he turns around, looks at me and smiles.

317
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:41,600
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

318
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,340
Speaker 0: So I have the power by turning around and looking at you to completely derail you and prevent you from speaking.

319
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,077
Speaker 1: No.

320
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:55,159
Speaker 0: I have so much psychic power that with a mere glance, I can- it's like Tasha's hideous laughter that seventh level spell.

321
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,159
Speaker 1: It's a Morty giggly right now, and it doesn't take much.

322
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,400
Speaker 0: All right, Scott, I won't turn around and look at you.

323
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,220
Speaker 1: You're going to do something.

324
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:05,980
Speaker 1: Wow.

325
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:10,279
Speaker 1: When was the last time we had a show where we got completely derailed and we had to cut it out?
