1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,338
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, May 10th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:09,580
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:12,790
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,135
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:16,062
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about the Playdate.

6
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:17,990
Speaker 1: It's a tiny little gaming console.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,528
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:21,550
Speaker 0: So,

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:35,389
Speaker 1: uh, many of you know we are fans of the old stick puck, that game where a bunch of people put blades on their feet and move around on some ice trying to make a little piece of rubber go into one of two opposing nets with sticks and fisticuffs.

10
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:36,290
Speaker 1: It's a great sport.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,230
Speaker 0: It is, it is, it is popular, but it is not the most popular.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,490
Speaker 1: I want to say it's still the fourth most popular sport in the United States, last I checked.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,729
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess it's weird because actually...

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,310
Speaker 1: Not counting esports, because esports are more popular than even like American football, but that's a whole separate...

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,987
Speaker 0: If you add them all together, then yes.

16
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:54,249
Speaker 0: Yeah.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,293
Speaker 0: But, um, it's actually interesting.

18
00:00:56,513 --> 00:01:07,669
Speaker 0: MLS in the US, which is, you know, is basically rising in like number of fans popularity and like attendance popularity more rapidly than the NHL is.

19
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:22,890
Speaker 0: And so depending on how you consider it, you might say it is or soon will be the fourth biggest professional sports league in the US, but its revenues compared to the NHL are not remotely close.

20
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:24,805
Speaker 0: The NHL has way more money.

21
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,110
Speaker 1: Because while there are fewer people who care about hockey, those people care a lot about hockey on average in my experience.

22
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:36,360
Speaker 0: Well, I think a lot of it comes down to the TV deal, right?

23
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,430
Speaker 0: NHL has big TV deals and the MLS doesn't have as big a TV deals.

24
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:48,809
Speaker 0: The MLS has bigger stadiums, more seats, fewer games than the NHL, which has like an 82 game season.

25
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:58,209
Speaker 1: But if you're in a market where people care about hockey, there is a scary percentage of the people who want to go to games who will pay almost anything for one of those seats.

26
00:01:58,774 --> 00:01:59,947
Speaker 1: Even for like some regular game.

27
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,329
Speaker 0: There's certain places where that's not true.

28
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:09,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was talking about specific markets, like go to like, go try to see the Leafs in Toronto.

29
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,748
Speaker 0: That's the hardest, that's literally the biggest one.

30
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,886
Speaker 1: Even when they're second in the last place in the league, sold out games.

31
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:16,790
Speaker 1: That is hockey.

32
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,318
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, we, uh, of course Rangers are in the playoffs.

33
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:25,887
Speaker 1: This is the most playoff ready they've been in a long, long time.

34
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:26,829
Speaker 1: They were a really good team.

35
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:40,950
Speaker 0: They've been in playoffs since like 2017. here and there was a, there was a pandemic and there was a, you know, so it's like since we started being able to afford a portion of season tickets, right, we can't afford season tickets.

36
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,190
Speaker 1: We split a half season across like six people.

37
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:44,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people.

38
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:52,910
Speaker 0: But since we've had tickets, right, they really haven't made, I think the first season we bought like 10 games of tickets.

39
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:57,768
Speaker 0: We were able to go to one playoff game right in the, in the first series.

40
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:58,289
Speaker 0: And that was it.

41
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,652
Speaker 0: So yeah, they finally made it.

42
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:03,397
Speaker 0: So all I knew we weren't going to win the cup.

43
00:03:03,437 --> 00:03:04,880
Speaker 0: The chances of that were really weak.

44
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,730
Speaker 0: is even if he miraculously made it to like the conference finals, it's like, well, Colorado is going to destroy us.

45
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,129
Speaker 0: And if we make it to the finals in America, a double miracle, Colorado is going to destroy us.

46
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:27,910
Speaker 1: Colorado has swept, uh, their first round and every other literally except the Rangers, every other matchup in the entire NHL is currently tied at two games each.

47
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:35,850
Speaker 1: The Rangers are unique in that they're losing three games to one and might be better than Nashville who got swept by Colorado.

48
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, uh, not too bad.

49
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:43,430
Speaker 1: Also, we're better than all the teams who didn't make it into the playoffs, but the other half of the league, right?

50
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,177
Speaker 0: We're in the top half, but yeah, I expected us though to make the second round.

51
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:49,921
Speaker 0: We did well against the Penguins in the regular season.

52
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:54,790
Speaker 0: We're healthier than we were during portions of the regular season, right?

53
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,715
Speaker 1: But a bunch of stuff, the games didn't go well for a lot of reasons.

54
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:08,610
Speaker 1: We won't turn this into the hockey show, but suffice it to say the Rangers barely lost the first game in a record setting overtime that Emily and I were at.

55
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,774
Speaker 1: We didn't get home until like midnight 30 after that game.

56
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:24,690
Speaker 1: It was, it was, it was a real fun time, but it was amazing when that goal was scored in basically the third period of a second whole ass hockey game that we watched.

57
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:27,152
Speaker 1: The game ended and suddenly

58
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,193
Speaker 0: for the price of one, it

59
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:41,270
Speaker 1: went from one of the loudest arenas I have ever been in at any point in my life to silent for about 10 seconds, followed by this very quiet grumbling as everyone just simultaneously stood up and funneled out of that arena at midnight.

60
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:48,143
Speaker 1: Nobody was saying a word except for one pens fan who was very classily just standing there clapping.

61
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:49,546
Speaker 1: It was beautiful.

62
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:51,750
Speaker 0: What else you gonna, you know, that's what I would do.

63
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:53,731
Speaker 1: Yeah.

64
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:59,058
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not like it's, it's not like a game in Philly where like people just start throwing batteries at you.

65
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:00,060
Speaker 0: Yeah.

66
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,508
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, in that game, the margin was close, but in the last two games we played in Pittsburgh, we got embarrassed.

67
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,552
Speaker 0: They were, we just got shreds.

68
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:11,014
Speaker 1: Game one, ridiculous overtime.

69
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:12,736
Speaker 1: Game two, the Rangers crush him.

70
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:15,239
Speaker 1: Game three, real close.

71
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:16,780
Speaker 1: Game four, the Rangers get.

72
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,263
Speaker 0: Game three wasn't, it was kind of close.

73
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:20,424
Speaker 1: The Rangers were fucking it up.

74
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:25,330
Speaker 1: They came back big with a big comeback, but they couldn't actually win the game.

75
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,971
Speaker 1: And then the last game was.

76
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:29,033
Speaker 1: I even stopped watching just to shreds.

77
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,254
Speaker 1: The Rangers are joking.

78
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:32,036
Speaker 1: It's not like I might be the goal.

79
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:37,360
Speaker 1: Like, I don't know, Igor, one of the best, brightest stars of goaltending in the league might just be choking in the playoffs.

80
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,521
Speaker 1: It's hard to say what's happening.

81
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:39,182
Speaker 0: Who knows?

82
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:40,223
Speaker 0: There's a lot going on this.

83
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:44,166
Speaker 0: I was expecting us to be able to see four or five playoff.

84
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:46,929
Speaker 0: All I wanted was more playoff hockey games to go to.

85
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:47,149
Speaker 0: Right.

86
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,370
Speaker 0: That was all I wanted to know.

87
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,872
Speaker 1: It looks like we're going to probably get three.

88
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:55,255
Speaker 0: And if we're extremely, extremely lucky, right?

89
00:05:55,315 --> 00:06:00,719
Speaker 0: I mean, like we could, there's still a possibility of more, but it's looking like three and the third one's tomorrow.

90
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:11,807
Speaker 1: Anything can happen in the playoffs and playoff hockey in the NHL tends to be, there are several upsets every year, but I do not feel like.

91
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:16,190
Speaker 0: The Rangers did come back from a 3-1 deficit in a previous year, many years ago.

92
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,131
Speaker 1: So also the reverse happens.

93
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:23,075
Speaker 1: The Toronto Maple Leafs are famous for fucking up 3-0 leads in series.

94
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:26,317
Speaker 1: So, uh, we'll see, but I'm not holding my breath.

95
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:31,081
Speaker 1: I will bet a nickel that the Rangers win the game we go to tomorrow.

96
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:37,726
Speaker 1: because there's a nickel currently sitting on my desk that I, as I look at it right now, one, where did the fuck did it even come from?

97
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:40,467
Speaker 1: I'm actually not sure why this nickel is here.

98
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:43,790
Speaker 1: I think it was like under my monitor stand and something pushed it out.

99
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:50,075
Speaker 1: But two, I'm, I'm willing to risk that nickel because frankly, I should just throw that nickel away.

100
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:51,536
Speaker 1: Like, well, what am I going to do with a nickel?

101
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:55,579
Speaker 0: Give it to a desperate person on the street who would be very happy to receive.

102
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:56,940
Speaker 1: What could they even do with a nickel?

103
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,743
Speaker 0: It would add up slowly with all the other change they're getting and eventually they'd be able to buy something.

104
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:02,524
Speaker 1: I don't know.

105
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:04,586
Speaker 1: A nickel almost runs down, rounds down to zero.

106
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:06,307
Speaker 1: That metal might be worth more if I hugged it.

107
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:10,370
Speaker 0: I save all my spare change and then when I take it to the bank, it's like hundreds of dollars.

108
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,532
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did that once.

109
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:14,558
Speaker 1: And that giant thing ended up being almost a thousand dollars.

110
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:16,601
Speaker 0: And now you waited too long.

111
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:19,727
Speaker 1: But now I don't collect any change because I don't use cash ever.

112
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:20,508
Speaker 0: I hardly use.

113
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:21,350
Speaker 0: I hardly ever.

114
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,172
Speaker 0: In fact, you know what else is on my desk?

115
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:23,933
Speaker 0: My wallet.

116
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:25,054
Speaker 1: You know what is in the wallet?

117
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:37,928
Speaker 1: The same cash that was in the wallet at PAX East before COVID happened and 60 pounds because that's what I put in my wallet before I went to London.

118
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,330
Speaker 1: Didn't use any of that either.

119
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,356
Speaker 0: I've used some cash, but I haven't.

120
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:45,103
Speaker 0: My cash using has gone way, way, way down.

121
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,590
Speaker 0: But I have gotten some change recently from things.

122
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:51,356
Speaker 1: I don't think there's anything I would even use change for in a year.

123
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:53,620
Speaker 1: I don't think I'll even use cash again at any point.

124
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:58,469
Speaker 1: In fact, in London, most places are credit only or card only or phone only.

125
00:07:58,509 --> 00:07:59,230
Speaker 1: They don't take any cash.

126
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,057
Speaker 0: What do people who don't have any unbanked people do?

127
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:02,558
Speaker 0: Nothing.

128
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:05,005
Speaker 1: You just can't go do business in those places anymore.

129
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:05,887
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it's good.

130
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:06,870
Speaker 1: I'm saying that's what happened.

131
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,133
Speaker 0: That's bad.

132
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:11,441
Speaker 0: Anyway, a lot of gaming news going on.

133
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:14,508
Speaker 0: We haven't done a gaming show in a long time, I guess.

134
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:15,250
Speaker 0: I can't even remember.

135
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,638
Speaker 1: So we'll go through a few big, big, big news that we just got to talk about.

136
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:25,870
Speaker 1: And first and probably the most important long term is this news about FIFA and EA.

137
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,330
Speaker 0: I don't think it's the biggest of our news.

138
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:31,910
Speaker 1: I think it's the biggest news in terms of the money involved.

139
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:32,933
Speaker 0: Yeah.

140
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:37,708
Speaker 0: So I don't know what the, there was a big dispute of some kind, right, that I didn't even realize was happening.

141
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,589
Speaker 0: FIFA EA has been making the FIFA soccer game for 30 years, something like that.

142
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:44,789
Speaker 0: Right.

143
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:52,865
Speaker 1: I mean, they make they make the whatever sport, whatever year game, they just crank those things out year after year.

144
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,050
Speaker 1: And those things sell like crazy.

145
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:55,932
Speaker 0: Right.

146
00:08:55,972 --> 00:09:04,770
Speaker 0: I mean, at various times, you know, they're like, I don't think EA like the NBA and the MLB like this, like MLB the show.

147
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:10,600
Speaker 0: And there were like two various times, you know, EA, you know, I guess they may have.

148
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,530
Speaker 0: I don't know if at any point did they actually have the exclusive license to all major sports leagues simultaneously.

149
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,327
Speaker 0: I don't know if they did, but I'm not sure.

150
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:20,930
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna have to look.

151
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,211
Speaker 1: Yeah.

152
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:26,369
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, the leagues have moved around, you know, some of them having non-exclusive licenses.

153
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:26,550
Speaker 0: Right.

154
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,616
Speaker 0: I remember times when, like, you could buy like.

155
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:36,090
Speaker 0: there were several different football and hockey games you could buy that were all officially licensed and from several different publishers.

156
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,391
Speaker 0: Right.

157
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:37,976
Speaker 0: Because they weren't exclusive licenses.

158
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:38,899
Speaker 0: Yeah.

159
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:42,450
Speaker 0: But EA sort of, you know, started the whole exclusive license deal.

160
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:42,590
Speaker 0: Right.

161
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,334
Speaker 0: Madden is the NFL game.

162
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:51,770
Speaker 0: You can make a football game if you want, but it can't have, you know, NFL teams, logos, trademarks, player names, anything.

163
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:51,950
Speaker 0: Right.

164
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,313
Speaker 0: Because we have the exclusive deal.

165
00:09:55,017 --> 00:10:00,069
Speaker 0: And so they have had the exclusive deal for FIFA soccer for 30 years.

166
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:04,781
Speaker 0: And it's like their biggest game, the biggest moneymaker for EA.

167
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:08,110
Speaker 0: And now that license has been lost.

168
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:11,560
Speaker 0: So presumably the next version is going to be called.

169
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,528
Speaker 0: that was something like something FC.

170
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:15,070
Speaker 0: Right.

171
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,550
Speaker 1: Yeah.

172
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:17,818
Speaker 1: It said name change.

173
00:10:17,938 --> 00:10:21,710
Speaker 1: And the article is a little bit sketch on any of the details.

174
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,633
Speaker 0: It says it's something FC.

175
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:24,054
Speaker 0: Right.

176
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:26,218
Speaker 0: But, you know, for football club.

177
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:33,270
Speaker 0: But the point is, it's not going to have like, you know, FIFA team names, player names.

178
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:35,621
Speaker 0: They guess they're not allowed to have that in there now.

179
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:37,329
Speaker 0: We'll see.

180
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:43,470
Speaker 1: Well, because FIFA is launching their own new soccer video games with, uh, it just has third party studios and publishers.

181
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:54,310
Speaker 1: And they're also targeting, I get the impression they're going to make a bunch of different soccer themed games all over the place and all sorts of different platforms.

182
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:00,549
Speaker 1: Because it also says they're making, quote, several non simulation games were already in production and will launch in the third quarter of this year.

183
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:01,572
Speaker 0: Yep.

184
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:06,183
Speaker 0: So it'll be interesting to be like, all right, do our people going to play these?

185
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:08,890
Speaker 0: You know, it's like FIFA is garbage.

186
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:09,932
Speaker 0: Really?

187
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:11,978
Speaker 0: It's it's a perfectly fine soccer game.

188
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:15,429
Speaker 0: The garbage part of it is the microtransaction gambling part without that part.

189
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,593
Speaker 0: FIFA is actually pretty decent.

190
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:26,330
Speaker 0: The only feature I would like to see FIFA ad is the same feature I would like all team sports games to add, which is a multiplayer mode where one player is one person.

191
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:26,631
Speaker 0: Right.

192
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:30,846
Speaker 0: It's like, why can't we play eleven on eleven Internet real time soccer?

193
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:32,090
Speaker 0: Why is that not a thing?

194
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,325
Speaker 1: Because most of the people would be doing something very boring most of the time.

195
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:36,149
Speaker 1: And it's actually not fun.

196
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:40,258
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe your sport is boring and unfun.

197
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:40,939
Speaker 0: then anyway.

198
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,450
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, why don't you play nine on nine baseball online?

199
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,393
Speaker 0: You stand in the outfield.

200
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:50,390
Speaker 0: This is maybe baseball has a itself has a problem because you know what?

201
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:54,000
Speaker 0: Five on five real time basketball is a thing.

202
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,704
Speaker 0: There is an NBA game that does that.

203
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:57,850
Speaker 0: It just also has gambling and microtransaction.

204
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,430
Speaker 1: I mean, there's Rocket League and the whole team is out there.

205
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:04,482
Speaker 0: Rocket League is the perfect team sports video game.

206
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:04,944
Speaker 0: There's.

207
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:06,790
Speaker 0: it is flawed in no way anyway.

208
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:10,896
Speaker 0: So, yeah, it'll be interesting to see.

209
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:17,570
Speaker 0: Will people continue playing the game that is actually a decent game?

210
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,681
Speaker 0: And maybe they're also addicted to the gambling loot box part of it or not.

211
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:22,162
Speaker 0: Right.

212
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,609
Speaker 0: But doesn't have their favorite teams, logos, etc.

213
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:36,590
Speaker 0: Or will people go and play presumably garbage games that happen to be officially licensed by FIFA and all their favorite soccer players and teams are there?

214
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:44,870
Speaker 1: Now, before you win, before anyone out there decides on their opinion, I'm just going to read a statement that looks like it's from the FIFA president.

215
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,670
Speaker 1: That is just really funny in terms of how they how they phrase this quote.

216
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:58,370
Speaker 1: I can assure you that the only authentic real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans.

217
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:05,850
Speaker 0: And so, I mean, I'm not saying it's likely, but it's like they could surprise us and come out with an amazing game.

218
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:13,770
Speaker 0: They could, you know, we're also going to find out what the fact that FIFA is behind it doesn't give you any confidence whatsoever, but it's possible.

219
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:20,690
Speaker 1: We're also going to find out how much the mapping to the real world players matters versus the game itself.

220
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:24,024
Speaker 1: I'll bet you see the player base split almost right down the middle.

221
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:28,360
Speaker 1: because I remember as a kid, I had friends who every year bought whatever.

222
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,165
Speaker 1: NHL 97 came out, they bought it.

223
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:31,550
Speaker 1: NHL 98 came out, they bought it.

224
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:33,797
Speaker 1: And they would only play the newest one.

225
00:13:33,998 --> 00:13:37,350
Speaker 1: And they were mostly people who were very focused on the sport itself.

226
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:41,930
Speaker 1: And everyone else just kept playing NHL 97 because it was the most fun one at the time.

227
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,221
Speaker 0: I mean, my cousins had one cousin had ice hockey, right?

228
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:47,984
Speaker 0: The NES one.

229
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:50,350
Speaker 0: Another cousin had blades of steel, right?

230
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:57,310
Speaker 0: We had, we made the poor decision of, I was like, well, I've already played those two hockey games.

231
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,777
Speaker 0: Let me buy the newer Wayne Gretzky one.

232
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:00,580
Speaker 0: That was a mistake.

233
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:03,570
Speaker 0: Wayne Gretzky hockey for the NES is real bad.

234
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:09,283
Speaker 0: And then the N64, I think we had, there was the Wayne Gretzky one, which is good.

235
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:10,186
Speaker 0: And there was NHL 99 on the N64.

236
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:19,490
Speaker 0: And then I think that's the last digital ice hockey game I've played that was officially licensed by the NHL.

237
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:30,770
Speaker 1: Soccer wise, there was that one soccer game on the NES that was basically the same graphics and producer and everything.

238
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,859
Speaker 1: It's in the extended universe of Super Dodgeball.

239
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:36,969
Speaker 1: And it was a pretty good soccer game.

240
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,877
Speaker 0: But it was Mega Man Soccer.

241
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:39,982
Speaker 0: There's a lot of them out there.

242
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:41,107
Speaker 0: Mario Strikers.

243
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:41,650
Speaker 0: Anyway.

244
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,489
Speaker 1: Mario Strikers was actually pretty fun.

245
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:44,473
Speaker 0: Yeah.

246
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:45,429
Speaker 0: So what other news we get?

247
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:52,730
Speaker 1: So in some other news, Bethesda, if you were unaware, only Bethesda people care about this.

248
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,049
Speaker 1: They had a PC launcher like a lot of big companies do.

249
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:01,890
Speaker 1: So there was an application you'd run to launch all your Bethesda games and do all your Bethesda gaming stuff.

250
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,510
Speaker 1: Just like I have this battle net launcher for Blizzard and I have Steam for literally every other game I play.

251
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,930
Speaker 1: Except Fortnite, which has its own launcher that, as far as I'm concerned, only launches Fortnite and can't do anything else.

252
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:24,530
Speaker 1: Bethesda very wisely has given up on this nonsense and they are shutting their launcher down and forcing everyone to migrate away.

253
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,927
Speaker 1: And they made it really easy to do.

254
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,250
Speaker 1: So right now, if you use the Bethesda launcher, it's going to stop working tomorrow.

255
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:44,690
Speaker 1: But you can just log into their website and transfer your entire Bethesda game library, including your DLC, any of your in-game crap, literally everything, seamlessly to Steam.

256
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,400
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's not going to be seamless for everyone.

257
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,330
Speaker 0: There's probably people out there having problems with it.

258
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,570
Speaker 0: But it's, at least in theory, that's what it's supposed to do.

259
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:57,490
Speaker 0: So at least good on them for, you know, making good on paper, right?

260
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,930
Speaker 1: Well, so far the reports are people are saying that it seems to mostly work just fine.

261
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:15,448
Speaker 1: Only extremely crazy people who care a lot about very specific things that most people don't are having what look like minor problems, especially if they've done anything that has some mods in it.

262
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:27,969
Speaker 1: And a big positive, though, is that a bunch of games, as a result of this, are now just available on Steam that were never available anywhere but Bethesda's launcher before.

263
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:28,985
Speaker 0: That's good.

264
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:39,889
Speaker 1: Including Elder Scrolls Arena, Elder Scrolls Daggerfall, some mod creation kit for Fallout 4, the Skyrim Special Edition, Wolfenstein Enemy Territory, etc.

265
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:45,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I don't want to play any of those, but it's good that they're available, right?

266
00:16:47,231 --> 00:17:04,494
Speaker 0: So yeah, I think, you know, it makes sense to me when you have something like Epic or even EA Origin, which are stores in their own right, and they would want you to use those because that way if you play some games on their platform, you'll buy other games through their platform and they'll make money, right?

267
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:08,609
Speaker 0: So that makes sense to me for a company to put development effort into that.

268
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, it also makes sense if a company has a-.

269
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,788
Speaker 1: There's one other area where it makes sense.

270
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,790
Speaker 1: If the company has a significant- Or

271
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:26,781
Speaker 0: the launcher for Bethesda or the, you know, it's like, I guess the battle in that one does make sense, but it's like these other ones, it's like if you're not turning it into a store, it's like you're putting in all these development resources to make this launcher.

272
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:30,310
Speaker 0: that only makes your users unhappy?

273
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:42,770
Speaker 1: Well, if you let me finish, the other big use case for this is if your games and your players have a significant community among themselves and that community is built within your launcher or within your platform.

274
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:48,930
Speaker 1: Like the friends I set in Overwatch theoretically could be used in other games.

275
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:56,330
Speaker 1: Granted, Overwatch is the only game I play in that launcher, but if I played other games, I could have my same friends there.

276
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,548
Speaker 0: But not all these launchers do that, right?

277
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:13,230
Speaker 0: There's a lot of games I'll play on Steam where it's like I start the game and some launcher appears and then I have to press play and it's like that launcher doesn't actually do anything except maybe log into an account for the company that made the game.

278
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,754
Speaker 0: Even Civilization 6!

279
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:20,010
Speaker 1: I gotta click on this stupid launcher that Steam launches before Civ 6 starts for literally no reason.

280
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,639
Speaker 0: Right, it's like they put development effort into that.

281
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,250
Speaker 0: It would have been easier to just have the game just start.

282
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:27,841
Speaker 0: In fact, the launcher wasn't there originally.

283
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:29,670
Speaker 0: They added it after a while, right?

284
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:37,810
Speaker 0: Bethesda, I think, is doing a smart thing here, realizing we're putting all this development effort into the launcher for no reason.

285
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:41,279
Speaker 0: Let's stop wasting our resources on that.

286
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:44,026
Speaker 0: Here, you can buy our game on whatever platform and launch it.

287
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:44,828
Speaker 0: It's an EXE.

288
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:45,530
Speaker 0: Go nuts.

289
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:53,770
Speaker 1: In some other news, Square Enix, which has honestly been in sharp decline for some time now for a bunch of reasons.

290
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,225
Speaker 1: We don't need to get into here.

291
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,661
Speaker 0: Except for the Final Fantasy Online, which is successful.

292
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:58,846
Speaker 0: It's like the last MMO.

293
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:16,670
Speaker 1: So, they are selling a bunch of the sub-studios they've got, including Crystal Dynamics and Eidos, to Embracer, which is this big venture capital firm that is buying up every goddamn game company on Earth, as far as I can see.

294
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,159
Speaker 0: So, Embracer is the real news, but there's two news here, right?

295
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:23,608
Speaker 0: So, Square Enix declining further isn't really a big news.

296
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:24,550
Speaker 0: It's a medium news.

297
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:58,998
Speaker 1: The only reason I even bring up Square Enix, other than to point out that they're selling this stuff, is that they're selling these companies in possibly the worst timed move I have ever seen in my entire life to focus on blockchain and blockchain games, just as... ...because NFTs are not a market, they're just a scam, collapsed, and they're all worth nothing.

298
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:05,870
Speaker 1: The whole thing is falling apart, just as Square Enix doubled down on that bullshit, which I just find hilarious.

299
00:20:07,511 --> 00:20:07,911
Speaker 0: Yeah.

300
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:21,770
Speaker 0: But the big, huge, huge news is that Embracer Group, which over the past year or few, has slowly acquired many, many, many nerdy companies of significance.

301
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,230
Speaker 0: Right?

302
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:27,776
Speaker 0: Obviously, they haven't acquired the S-tier giant nerd companies.

303
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:28,537
Speaker 0: Disney did that.

304
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:32,562
Speaker 0: But it's like, if you think about it, Disney bought Marvel.

305
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:35,144
Speaker 0: Embracer, did they buy DC?

306
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:36,826
Speaker 0: No, Warner Brothers owns DC.

307
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:37,987
Speaker 0: What did they buy?

308
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:40,350
Speaker 0: The second tier down, they bought Dark Horse Comics.

309
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,534
Speaker 0: It's like, what else did Embracer buy?

310
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:52,050
Speaker 0: They bought Asmodei, the company that was already buying up other board game companies into a big clomp.

311
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,651
Speaker 0: Right?

312
00:20:52,671 --> 00:21:02,050
Speaker 0: They bought, you know, Asmodei bought Fantasy Fly and all these other board game companies, and then Embracer bought that, the whole set of them, all at once.

313
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:16,947
Speaker 0: So Dark Horse and that, and several video game studios are now owned by this one Swedish company that nerds, you know, it's like, nerds tend to know about the companies that make nerdy stuff.

314
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:19,890
Speaker 0: Like, you know who the CEO of Nintendo is, right?

315
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,297
Speaker 1: D&D people knew what TSR was for a long time, and now they know Wizards.

316
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:25,098
Speaker 1: They know what Wizards is.

317
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:29,205
Speaker 0: Right, you understand at least the, you know, the culture and messaging of the company.

318
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:31,548
Speaker 1: At least they know that Wizards is owned by Hasbro.

319
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:32,610
Speaker 1: They've heard of Hasbro.

320
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:42,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, the company's face might be a manufactured face by the marketing and PR department, but it's at least a face that you're familiar with, you, right?

321
00:21:42,104 --> 00:21:42,845
Speaker 0: It's like Apple, right?

322
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:45,950
Speaker 0: It's like, you know what's going on with Tim Apple, kinda, right?

323
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:48,677
Speaker 0: Nobody fucking knows, right?

324
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:52,608
Speaker 0: Almost nobody is paying any attention to what the fuck is going on with Embracer group.

325
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:53,430
Speaker 0: We don't know what they're like.

326
00:21:53,590 --> 00:22:09,608
Speaker 1: So I got an article from May 2nd, and what it points out is Embracer has now grown to over 14,000 employees, most of whom are game designers and developers from studios they've bought, and they have acquired at least 124 distinct studios in recent memory.

327
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:12,813
Speaker 0: Yep.

328
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,067
Speaker 0: So all those studios...

329
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,743
Speaker 1: I dare anyone listening to the show or anyone I know to name 124 game studios.

330
00:22:21,345 --> 00:22:23,270
Speaker 1: Name 50, and I will be impressed.

331
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:24,270
Speaker 0: Right.

332
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,855
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, their name is, I guess, very apt, right?

333
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:27,596
Speaker 0: They're embracing.

334
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:29,720
Speaker 0: They sure are embracing, right?

335
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,124
Speaker 0: So there has to be, right?

336
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:35,270
Speaker 0: You don't just go around embracing for no reason, right?

337
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,257
Speaker 0: There has to be, that swing is gonna swing the other direction at some point.

338
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:45,604
Speaker 0: They're gonna, you know, aggregate, conglomerate, you know, they gotta do, you know, they're gonna do something.

339
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:49,870
Speaker 0: You don't just buy companies to let them continue operating as they were and don't do anything.

340
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,894
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say this is not investment advice.

341
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:57,446
Speaker 1: I am not a registered investment advisor, but in my personal opinion, all these companies need to be broken up.

342
00:22:57,486 --> 00:22:59,570
Speaker 1: These kinds of acquisitions shouldn't even be possible.

343
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:08,150
Speaker 1: And this is dangerous to the entertainment ecosystem and the gaming ecosystem, as dangerous as Disney buying every intellectual property.

344
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:10,173
Speaker 0: Yeah.

345
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:15,683
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, yes, on the one hand, thanks to the internet, we have plenty of free culture, right?

346
00:23:15,783 --> 00:23:19,750
Speaker 0: Anyone can just make and distribute their art however they want freely, right?

347
00:23:20,251 --> 00:23:25,417
Speaker 0: But, you know, just making your own website, you know, it's very difficult to broadcast, right?

348
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:36,050
Speaker 0: Even if you have social media where my tweet, you know, could, if I get enough followers, I could theoretically get my tweet out to as many people as, you know, a famous person does, right?

349
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,692
Speaker 0: It could happen.

350
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:37,314
Speaker 0: There's.

351
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:42,289
Speaker 0: no, it's not like in the old days where I literally couldn't broadcast on TV, but a rich person could.

352
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,110
Speaker 1: Let me see what the most watched geek night's YouTube video is while you're talking.

353
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:47,112
Speaker 0: Right.

354
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:53,081
Speaker 0: But at the same time, uh, you know, having a big giant pile of money, right?

355
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:58,590
Speaker 0: Allows you to get your message out, even with the fact that the internet exists, right?

356
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:02,755
Speaker 0: You can hire people to rebroadcast your message, right?

357
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:13,370
Speaker 0: You know, you can buy ads and, you know, make other people start broadcasting on more channels on the internet and non-internet and amplify your voice with money.

358
00:24:13,931 --> 00:24:25,347
Speaker 0: And so these large companies owning so much of our culture, right, end up just controlling a lot of the messages that all of humanity hears and have.

359
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,110
Speaker 0: the, there's the loudest voices in the room.

360
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:32,083
Speaker 0: And it's not a good, you know, world culture to have a few loud voices.

361
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:34,550
Speaker 0: It's much better to have lots and lots of medium voices.

362
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:45,666
Speaker 1: So yeah, the most, uh, so the, the most watched YouTube video is that Brexit Simpsons thing that I made, but, uh, number two right after it is designing game rules.

363
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:48,470
Speaker 1: That's actually our most popular panel we've ever done on YouTube.

364
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:50,065
Speaker 1: Okay.

365
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:52,054
Speaker 1: 150,000 ish views.

366
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:54,844
Speaker 1: And a lot of them are kind of recent.

367
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:56,730
Speaker 1: It's actually, people are watching it a lot lately.

368
00:24:57,611 --> 00:25:00,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, it's not, that's, you know, it's like, that's a lot for us.

369
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:02,551
Speaker 0: Right.

370
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:12,648
Speaker 0: It's like, could you imagine like, you know, in 1990 something, two guys making a recording a video on a VHS tape and getting a hundred thousand views, right?

371
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:13,330
Speaker 0: Impossible.

372
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,570
Speaker 0: Right.

373
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,319
Speaker 0: But in this age, a hundred thousand views is basically nothing.

374
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,163
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like, you're not a million views.

375
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:20,644
Speaker 0: You're nothing.

376
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:21,206
Speaker 0: Right.

377
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:23,210
Speaker 0: Even a million views is not too much.

378
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:29,281
Speaker 1: Our YouTube channel is about like two and a half million views and like 8,000 subscribers.

379
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:32,748
Speaker 1: We're not even at the point where they'll send us one of those little plaques.

380
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:33,810
Speaker 1: Like we're not even close to that.

381
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:34,830
Speaker 0: Nope.

382
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:36,274
Speaker 0: Not even remotely.

383
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:40,123
Speaker 0: So, I mean the six, eight billion people on the earth, right?

384
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:43,290
Speaker 0: And some of those views might be repeat views.

385
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:55,870
Speaker 1: So in one last news, and I'll be talking about this a lot more, possibly on like special episodes or something, because Scott refuses to play games that are designed to his specifications for some reason.

386
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:01,457
Speaker 0: But I think you're just, you tend to be misconstruing my specifications.

387
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:03,700
Speaker 0: Maybe I should start doing that.

388
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,405
Speaker 0: It's just, you're just, you know, saying, oh, this game, this is ideal.

389
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:11,010
Speaker 0: This is exactly the game Rem wants, even though it's a game that you don't want at all.

390
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:25,790
Speaker 1: I would, based on the panels and gignives episodes we've done, that the, the games that are based on certain older games like tribes two or do things like those games tend to be games you would like games that do things that you have said are very good design.

391
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,212
Speaker 1: Does it have an absolutely.

392
00:26:27,473 --> 00:26:32,702
Speaker 0: If you game like tribes to what the things I liked in tribes to map that was fucking enormous.

393
00:26:33,604 --> 00:26:34,606
Speaker 0: Absolutely enormous.

394
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,970
Speaker 0: Does Overwatch have absolutely.

395
00:26:37,812 --> 00:26:39,716
Speaker 1: Overwatch is not the game that replaces tribes to.

396
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:41,881
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought you were going to talk about Overwatch two.

397
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:43,405
Speaker 1: No, I'm going to talk about Overwatch two.

398
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:45,570
Speaker 1: Overwatch two does not replace tribes two is what I'm saying.

399
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,972
Speaker 0: Then why even mentioned tribes two?

400
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:54,185
Speaker 1: Because I am confident if someone made a perfect tribes to FPS, like re-imagining, you would not actually play it.

401
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:57,270
Speaker 0: If it has a lot of players and it's not a gambling game.

402
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,333
Speaker 1: I still don't think you'd play it anyway.

403
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:09,730
Speaker 1: So, uh, Overwatch two, uh, the technical beta is out and I've been playing it a lot and I'm only going to share some very brief thoughts so far because otherwise the show is going to go way too long.

404
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:13,394
Speaker 1: But all the changes they have made are very welcome.

405
00:27:13,614 --> 00:27:16,757
Speaker 1: And I think it will be a very healthy esports ecosystem.

406
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:28,450
Speaker 1: And it's interesting how they are focusing on single player PVE type stuff to get the kinds of people who bounced off of Overwatch one to actually play Overwatch two.

407
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:45,230
Speaker 1: Because the thing that seems to have happened to most competitive FPS is a huge percentage of the players care about the lore and the story, but actually just want to play a casual game like Fortnite and do not want to have any competition whatsoever.

408
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:49,995
Speaker 0: I mean, that's the, just we've known that for, for decades already, right?

409
00:27:50,075 --> 00:28:05,290
Speaker 0: It's like, that's all we talk about is how, yeah, there are people who want to compete with other human beings and measure their skills against other human beings and work hard to improve their skills, whether it's a sport or a game or whatever it is.

410
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,130
Speaker 0: Right.

411
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:07,691
Speaker 0: There are people who want to do that.

412
00:28:07,892 --> 00:28:13,576
Speaker 0: And the vast majority of people have no interest in doing that, especially not during their leisure time.

413
00:28:13,636 --> 00:28:13,776
Speaker 0: Right.

414
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:16,438
Speaker 0: They consider improving their skills to be like non leisure.

415
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:16,918
Speaker 0: Right.

416
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:17,439
Speaker 0: It's hard.

417
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:18,460
Speaker 0: It's not fun for them.

418
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,100
Speaker 0: Right.

419
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,563
Speaker 0: They enjoy just, you know, they'll even admit like they enjoy shutting off.

420
00:28:23,684 --> 00:28:23,984
Speaker 0: Right.

421
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:25,085
Speaker 0: Not working hard.

422
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:25,705
Speaker 0: Right.

423
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:32,210
Speaker 0: Not, you know, it's like, and they want to do something that is not something that requires effort, but it's just a mindless entertainment.

424
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:42,670
Speaker 0: And so a game where you grind and your character improves in skills, but you don't is exactly the psychological thing that most people enjoy doing.

425
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:49,477
Speaker 1: It's very telling that when I play Fortnite with everyone but Scott, because Scott's the only one who won't play it, despite you trying to get us to play PUBG.

426
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:04,493
Speaker 1: You wouldn't be allowed to play with us.

427
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:06,576
Speaker 1: We only play in the real mouse and keyboard mode.

428
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:07,497
Speaker 1: So you couldn't play anyway.

429
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:08,058
Speaker 0: Well, that's good.

430
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:08,678
Speaker 0: I respect that.

431
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:17,630
Speaker 0: I would also only play the real mouse and keyboard mode, but in order to play it on my computer with my mouse and keyboard, I would have to install the epic store.

432
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,714
Speaker 1: Which I installed because it's completely worth it.

433
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:20,616
Speaker 1: That game is super fun.

434
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:21,437
Speaker 0: Yeah.

435
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:25,646
Speaker 0: But anyway, I already have all the time in my life filled with things.

436
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:27,329
Speaker 0: I don't need another thing.

437
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:27,770
Speaker 0: So why?

438
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:34,866
Speaker 1: So Overwatch 2, they are going to add all that stuff to get the people who don't want to see the actual number next to their name.

439
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,750
Speaker 1: that shows how good they actually are.

440
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,133
Speaker 1: So they'll have something to do, which I think is great.

441
00:29:39,754 --> 00:29:49,750
Speaker 1: But the beta is aimed solely at the competitive serious players, and they're only testing the competitive serious mode.

442
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,831
Speaker 1: And what do they do?

443
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:51,993
Speaker 1: Really simple.

444
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:59,001
Speaker 1: The teams are now 5v5 instead of 6v6, which really opens up the game.

445
00:29:59,702 --> 00:30:03,326
Speaker 1: The required composition of the teams is more like a real sport.

446
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,270
Speaker 1: One tank, two supports, two DPS.

447
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:07,851
Speaker 0: No, wait.

448
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:08,372
Speaker 0: Hold on.

449
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:17,546
Speaker 0: In a real sport, there is rarely a large requirement on roles, right?

450
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:20,550
Speaker 1: One goalie, two wings, one center, two defensemen.

451
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,113
Speaker 0: That is not required at all.

452
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:24,498
Speaker 0: You could throw out.

453
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:27,724
Speaker 0: The only thing that's required is you can't have more than one goalie.

454
00:30:27,764 --> 00:30:28,586
Speaker 0: But you could throw out.

455
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:30,350
Speaker 0: You could put out six defensemen.

456
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,156
Speaker 1: You absolutely could.

457
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:33,561
Speaker 0: You could do whatever the hell you want.

458
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:34,263
Speaker 0: There's no requirement.

459
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:36,110
Speaker 1: And they are experimenting with that mode, too.

460
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,473
Speaker 0: You could put on, right?

461
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:41,197
Speaker 0: It's like, you could intentionally... So it's got baseball.

462
00:30:41,878 --> 00:30:44,142
Speaker 1: There are specific roles.

463
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:47,167
Speaker 1: You can't say, "Well, I'm not going to put a third baseman out.

464
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:47,988
Speaker 1: I'm going to have two second

465
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:48,369
Speaker 1: baseman.".

466
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:48,910
Speaker 1: You can't do that.

467
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:49,691
Speaker 0: Well, hold on.

468
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:56,280
Speaker 0: You do have to submit a lineup and designate someone as third baseman or whatever.

469
00:30:56,681 --> 00:31:00,987
Speaker 0: They could stand wherever the fuck... You could have all your people stand in the outfield if you wanted to.

470
00:31:01,828 --> 00:31:03,290
Speaker 0: There's no rule against that, right?

471
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:08,050
Speaker 0: The only thing that's required is a pitcher, a catcher, and seven other people.

472
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:16,040
Speaker 1: So to make the analogy to ice hockey, what this actually does to the game is the team composition is built around the tank.

473
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:24,470
Speaker 1: And the tank, if you're on defense, like if they're in the offensive zone, like you're on defense, the tank is basically the goalie.

474
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:31,570
Speaker 1: And that's the weird special one that everything is built around and the rest of the team is trying to sort of get out of the defense zone back on offense.

475
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:43,330
Speaker 1: But when you're on attack, imagine if in ice hockey, as soon as you take the zone, the goalie was allowed to cross the center line with their pads on and they were allowed to hit people without penalties.

476
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,456
Speaker 1: That's kind of what it feels like now.

477
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,950
Speaker 1: The goalie just charges the other line and starts beating the fuck out of people.

478
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,496
Speaker 1: It's ending up being real fun, but it's forcing really interesting tactics.

479
00:31:54,837 --> 00:32:02,570
Speaker 1: And by only having one tank, the game never turns into a big death ball sort of blob of people just grinding out a fight.

480
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:08,140
Speaker 1: The fighting is way more skill-based, way more positioning-based, way more open.

481
00:32:08,581 --> 00:32:12,610
Speaker 1: Every individual player's skill matters way more, not less.

482
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:20,583
Speaker 1: And as a result, what I'm already seeing is people who are not serious about playing the game to win will not enjoy Overwatch 2.

483
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,066
Speaker 1: It is an esport and nothing else.

484
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,050
Speaker 1: And I think every other aspect of the game...

485
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,469
Speaker 0: Well, they'll play that other mode.

486
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,754
Speaker 1: They'll play that other mode.

487
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:30,890
Speaker 1: And I think it's very noteworthy that they're not even bothering beta testing that other mode right now.

488
00:32:31,551 --> 00:32:33,250
Speaker 0: I don't think you need to beta test that other mode.

489
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,313
Speaker 1: No, because it doesn't need to be balanced.

490
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:35,076
Speaker 1: Who cares?

491
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:36,441
Speaker 1: You're going to level up your character.

492
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:37,083
Speaker 1: Who gives a shit?

493
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:39,070
Speaker 1: That's a mode I will probably never see.

494
00:32:40,231 --> 00:32:44,607
Speaker 1: So what I'm going to link to is a video that outlines every change they made to the characters because...

495
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,464
Speaker 0: I'm sure they'll continue to make drastic changes in a year.

496
00:32:48,644 --> 00:32:49,950
Speaker 0: It'll look completely different, right?

497
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,940
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, they are very willing to change the rules to make the game competitive and interesting.

498
00:32:55,361 --> 00:33:00,071
Speaker 1: And I am very much looking forward to the full release of Overwatch 2.

499
00:33:00,071 --> 00:33:06,390
Speaker 0: I do have a concern though that it's like, yeah, they're going to do about as, you know, I guess whatever's left of Blizzard, right?

500
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,670
Speaker 0: Who's whoever's still there at this point, right?

501
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,418
Speaker 0: You know, but, you know, considering that they've had, you know, whatever, whoever's left there has managed to do this.

502
00:33:14,498 --> 00:33:22,370
Speaker 0: much, you know, if they can carry it forward, but if it doesn't succeed financially, right?

503
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:30,690
Speaker 0: This could be like sort of the beginning of the end for the truly competitive, you know, digital games, right?

504
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:38,710
Speaker 0: Not that there won't be esports and games that people compete at, but they won't be fair, balanced, truly competitive games.

505
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,110
Speaker 0: They'll be like, you know, Fortnite tournament or whatever.

506
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:45,356
Speaker 1: They're not going to be Rocket League.

507
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:53,490
Speaker 1: As big as Rocket League esports is, it is tiny compared to other esports because it is a serious full skill game and a lot of people can't handle that.

508
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,089
Speaker 1: Both players and spectators.

509
00:33:55,631 --> 00:33:56,645
Speaker 0: You know, stuff like that.

510
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:56,990
Speaker 0: Anyway.

511
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,452
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, what am I saying?

512
00:33:58,592 --> 00:34:05,790
Speaker 1: I will watch people do competitive races of Final Fantasy 4 randomizers, so there's no accounting for taste if that's what I'm into.

513
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,205
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, the fighting game community is still there holding it down, right?

514
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,371
Speaker 0: Yep.

515
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:15,270
Speaker 1: And one last news, not gaming related, but we have to mention it because it's too important.

516
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,699
Speaker 1: As you might have seen, the US Supreme Court is full of fascists now.

517
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,429
Speaker 1: They're going to end abortion rights in America.

518
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,199
Speaker 1: This is an absolute disaster.

519
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,626
Speaker 1: This is going to cause a lot of death.

520
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:28,670
Speaker 1: This is just devastating.

521
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:37,770
Speaker 1: And all I want to say about this is if you're somehow not aware of this, how dare you find out about this from Geek Nights if you live in the United States?

522
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:39,288
Speaker 1: Like, how dare you?

523
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:48,590
Speaker 1: And two, there are protests outside of Republican senators' houses and there are protests outside of the houses of the fascists on the Supreme Court.

524
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:55,510
Speaker 1: And all I want to say about that is that is the right way to go because there is no way to vote our way out of this right now.

525
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,130
Speaker 1: And this is the tip of the iceberg of what's going to happen.

526
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:01,038
Speaker 0: And if you have a better idea, share with the class.

527
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:09,090
Speaker 1: There's a line I saw an activist say that I'm starting to repeat everywhere, and I think it's really important to say.

528
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:16,030
Speaker 1: And to paraphrase, it was basically people have thrown bricks to get change in the world.

529
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,598
Speaker 1: People have voted to get change in the world.

530
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,190
Speaker 1: Sometimes voting works without throwing bricks.

531
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:27,630
Speaker 1: Sometimes you got to vote and throw bricks, but just throwing bricks never fixes anything.

532
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:36,330
Speaker 1: So if you are the kind of person who gets to the point to where in self-defense you feel like you need to throw bricks, I'm not going to say you shouldn't.

533
00:35:36,912 --> 00:35:39,130
Speaker 1: No, a white dude with money can never tell anyone.

534
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:48,990
Speaker 1: No, I'm just saying if you are throwing bricks in self-defense because you are under deadly threat, I am not the person who should tell you not to do that.

535
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,950
Speaker 1: However, if you're going to throw bricks, you got to also vote.

536
00:35:53,950 --> 00:36:01,085
Speaker 1: Voting takes so little, and if enough of you vote, it can also be the other thread.

537
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:03,790
Speaker 1: It's the second front that you have to do.

538
00:36:04,151 --> 00:36:06,390
Speaker 1: If you're just throwing bricks and not voting, you're not helping.

539
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,694
Speaker 0: When you go to vote, you have to basically consider.

540
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:19,030
Speaker 0: There's a lot of people out there who are not happy with the actual choices of the people they have.

541
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:19,995
Speaker 0: You think I'm happy?

542
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:23,170
Speaker 1: You think I liked voting for Adams for the mayor of New York City?

543
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,334
Speaker 0: That's not what you're voting for.

544
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:26,457
Speaker 0: It doesn't fucking matter.

545
00:36:26,637 --> 00:36:31,210
Speaker 0: The point is that you have to accept the shitty reality.

546
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:34,280
Speaker 0: What you're voting for is these two choices.

547
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,110
Speaker 0: One vote, at least in the United States, these two choices.

548
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:44,650
Speaker 0: One choice is I am voting to make voting continue to be a thing that's real and matters.

549
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:50,750
Speaker 0: And the other choice is this might be the last time my vote is actually counted.

550
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:54,995
Speaker 1: That's not hyperbole.

551
00:36:55,476 --> 00:37:00,810
Speaker 1: Voting for a Republican in America means you are saying that I want this to be the last vote I ever make.

552
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:06,681
Speaker 0: The voting will become something like what they have in Russia.

553
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:09,628
Speaker 0: Even if Putin loses, he wins.

554
00:37:09,669 --> 00:37:10,250
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

555
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:17,006
Speaker 1: So in the primaries, vote for whoever is the most radical progressive that does exactly what you want.

556
00:37:17,286 --> 00:37:18,430
Speaker 1: Pull them left.

557
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,010
Speaker 1: But in the regular election, you vote for a Democrat no matter how shitty they are.

558
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:28,930
Speaker 0: No matter how small or big the election is, if you're in the United States and you have the right to vote, that's what you gotta do.

559
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,110
Speaker 1: We live in one of the most progressive metropolitan policies.

560
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,036
Speaker 0: Even if the person is a piece of shit.

561
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,388
Speaker 0: Even if you're in West Virginia, you fucking vote for Joe Manchin.

562
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:37,050
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

563
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:40,616
Speaker 1: Because the alternative is literal fascism.

564
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:48,850
Speaker 1: Not to butt anyway that downer, but anyway, it's time for things of the day.

565
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,414
Speaker 1: So this is an interesting little video.

566
00:37:52,614 --> 00:38:03,710
Speaker 1: It's one of those things where someone found an old documented case of someone made a bicycle where if you pedal, it spins a big propeller.

567
00:38:05,711 --> 00:38:10,510
Speaker 0: That's an idea someone would have in a time that was less technologically advanced than our current time.

568
00:38:11,774 --> 00:38:15,510
Speaker 1: Look at old flying machines and just imagine.

569
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,529
Speaker 0: Well, old attempts to fly machines.

570
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:25,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the thing where all those videos of people jumping off the Eiffel Tower and just falling to their deaths because none of these things could have ever possibly worked.

571
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:35,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the person who made, in old times, this propeller bicycle claimed that they could consistently get it to go 20 miles an hour on flat ground.

572
00:38:37,392 --> 00:38:44,130
Speaker 1: Which is not a fast speed for a bike, but that's faster than the average person on a bicycle rides their little bike around.

573
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,800
Speaker 0: So it's not a fast speed for a modern bike.

574
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:50,468
Speaker 0: Try to get any older bike to go 20 miles an hour.

575
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,030
Speaker 1: Get a Petty Farthing to go 20 miles an hour and not kill yourself when you try to stop.

576
00:38:54,170 --> 00:39:02,290
Speaker 0: Also, we go 20 miles an hour on our bikes, on our modern bikes with effort on a nice road or a nice surface.

577
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:07,650
Speaker 0: So on a shitty old bike on a shitty surface, 20 miles an hour is tough.

578
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,774
Speaker 1: But a propeller bike?

579
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:13,325
Speaker 1: Alright, so this YouTube video, they made a propeller bike.

580
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:14,830
Speaker 1: You pedal, spins a propeller.

581
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:21,610
Speaker 1: They tried to make it work, they tried to ride it, and then they got a professional bike racer to ride this bike around.

582
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:27,341
Speaker 1: And I'm not going to spoil it, but you learn some interesting things.

583
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:31,670
Speaker 1: The only thing I will spoil is propeller bikes are a terrible fucking idea.

584
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:34,880
Speaker 0: Pikachu.jpg.

585
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:36,389
Speaker 0: Everybody knows that.

586
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,790
Speaker 1: But the video is fun, especially when the real serious cyclist gets on the bike.

587
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,801
Speaker 1: And what he says it feels like when he's trying to ride.

588
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:46,030
Speaker 1: it is very funny.

589
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:51,909
Speaker 1: And if you are a cyclist, you know exactly what it feels like to ride this bike after you hear him describe it.

590
00:39:53,690 --> 00:40:06,365
Speaker 0: Anyway, so one thing, I think I might have done a thing of the day once where a guy from an avocado farm was like, "This is why when you take the pit out of the avocado, you can't just plant it and get a good tasty avocado.

591
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:07,268
Speaker 0: You'll get a disgusting

592
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:07,469
Speaker 0: one.".

593
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,210
Speaker 0: Did I make that a thing of the day?

594
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,261
Speaker 1: Pretty sure you did, because apples, we talked about it too.

595
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:12,890
Speaker 1: There was a good thing of the day about the apple problem.

596
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:13,571
Speaker 0: Yeah.

597
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:22,710
Speaker 0: So, I'm always thinking, my whole life I've been thinking like, "Hey, you buy fruits and vegetables, they got seeds in them, right?

598
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,019
Speaker 0: So you buy a pepper, it's got fucking seeds all over, right?

599
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:27,549
Speaker 0: Well, if you plant those, are they going to grow into peppers or not,

600
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:27,770
Speaker 0: right?".

601
00:40:28,171 --> 00:40:30,074
Speaker 0: And the answer varies, right?

602
00:40:30,174 --> 00:40:39,090
Speaker 0: It might, it might not, or it might make something disgusting, or it might make the fruit or vegetable that you bought, right?

603
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:41,629
Speaker 0: Or it might be hard to grow where you live, who knows?

604
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,974
Speaker 0: But, what about grains?

605
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:50,141
Speaker 0: I never really thought about trying to plant a grain, right?

606
00:40:50,221 --> 00:40:54,550
Speaker 0: It's like you, most of the time, because when you buy grain, it doesn't come in a plantable form.

607
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,836
Speaker 0: You buy some flour, you can't plant flour.

608
00:40:56,856 --> 00:40:59,302
Speaker 0: It's already milled, right?

609
00:40:59,342 --> 00:41:00,285
Speaker 0: It's like the end, right?

610
00:41:00,305 --> 00:41:02,390
Speaker 0: It's not a, it's not a wheat anymore.

611
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:06,430
Speaker 0: And I even, I don't even know if that part of the wheat is the part you would plant, right?

612
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:08,965
Speaker 1: Also, you know what's going to grow out of that if you plant it?

613
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:09,530
Speaker 1: Mushrooms.

614
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:11,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, right?

615
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,882
Speaker 0: Um, but, what about rice?

616
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:16,390
Speaker 0: Can you buy a rice and plant it?

617
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:28,170
Speaker 0: So, in this YouTube video, somebody documents the process by which they took some brown rice that they bought, and planted it, and tried to grow some rice in some buckets, and then harvest and eat the rice.

618
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:34,870
Speaker 0: They did not get a lot of rice, but they got some rice, and it's pretty impressive and interesting to see how rice grows.

619
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:40,424
Speaker 0: You know, because I've only ever really seen rice, you know, in a large agricultural setting on rice paddies.

620
00:41:40,484 --> 00:41:42,589
Speaker 0: I've never seen, like, individual rice plants.

621
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,090
Speaker 1: It's a big part of the Evangelion reboots, that rice.

622
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:52,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never seen, like, individual rice plants, like, growing, like, on their own, and that was pretty fascinating.

623
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,902
Speaker 0: So, and if you want to try to grow rice, here's a good how-to for you, right?

624
00:41:57,403 --> 00:41:59,650
Speaker 0: You're not going to get a lot of, a lot of quantity, though.

625
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:02,450
Speaker 1: Rice is small.

626
00:42:03,032 --> 00:42:05,961
Speaker 1: In the better moment, the Geek and Ice Book Club book is Nine Fox Gambit.

627
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:07,686
Speaker 1: In a few weeks, we'll probably do the show.

628
00:42:07,787 --> 00:42:08,730
Speaker 1: I'm burning through it.

629
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:10,432
Speaker 1: I like it.

630
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:15,830
Speaker 1: Like, Scott's already read it, and what I'll say for you, the listener, is one, it's violence.

631
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:18,801
Speaker 0: Why do you got to tell the listener about the book?

632
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:19,344
Speaker 0: They chose it.

633
00:42:19,365 --> 00:42:20,210
Speaker 0: They know everything about it.

634
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:20,691
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

635
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:56,090
Speaker 1: I'm just reminding you to remember how violent it is, but the way I describe it, having read enough of it now to sort of, like, get a sense of where it's going, insofar as you can in a sci-fi book this dense, uh, it feels like, in the culture books, where there's this, like, extremely abstracted world, and these extremely far-future concepts, and there'll be a mention or a brief scene of, like, a battle or a war, and you get a very short, like, zoom-in on what the war is like, but then it zooms back out, because it's not focused on that.

636
00:42:56,872 --> 00:43:04,310
Speaker 1: This book feels like, if you took one of those culture book, like, epic space wars, and zoomed all the way in on it, and focused on it.

637
00:43:06,991 --> 00:43:14,450
Speaker 1: That will only make sense if you have read, like, all of the culture books and started reading Nine Fox Gambit, but that's what it feels like.

638
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:16,624
Speaker 1: Uh, and I'm digging it.

639
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:17,210
Speaker 0: It's scratching.

640
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,190
Speaker 0: And the ships have names, just like culture.

641
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:25,844
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, uh, I had the itch of reading weird, far-future sci-fi.

642
00:43:25,884 --> 00:43:28,730
Speaker 1: just hit me like a brick after reading a little bit of this book.

643
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:36,650
Speaker 1: I, uh, I'm feeling big spaceships, big weird aliens that, uh, make it impossible to adapt things into television format.

644
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,990
Speaker 1: You're only going to get these in books.

645
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:41,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I will probably read that sequel.

646
00:43:42,777 --> 00:43:43,570
Speaker 0: As is tradition.

647
00:43:45,853 --> 00:43:53,589
Speaker 1: Also, soon we're going to read the sequel to, uh, The City We Became, which, uh, I feel like I'm going to read that within a day of it coming out, kind of like how...

648
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,549
Speaker 0: I actually, well, yeah, that I'll actually read, for sure.

649
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:03,190
Speaker 1: Kind of like when, uh, back when the Prince of Nothing books were coming out at an actual cadence, I'm pretty sure there's just no more going to come out at this point.

650
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:10,110
Speaker 1: But I remember when the second one in that duology came out, I think I finished it 48 hours after it appeared on my Kindle.

651
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:18,330
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, otherwise, uh, COVID numbers are rising, we ain't going anywhere, no conventions for the foreseeable future.

652
00:44:19,113 --> 00:44:21,610
Speaker 1: Uh, I even cancelled my trip to Sweden, so that's not going to happen.

653
00:44:22,597 --> 00:44:22,969
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

654
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:25,209
Speaker 0: Well, I guess you won't meet the Embracer group then.

655
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:26,134
Speaker 1: Uh, nope.

656
00:44:26,516 --> 00:44:28,769
Speaker 1: I, uh, I bet I could have gotten a meeting with them.

657
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:30,561
Speaker 1: I got some contacts.

658
00:44:30,763 --> 00:44:31,349
Speaker 1: I bet I could have.

659
00:44:32,697 --> 00:44:32,929
Speaker 1: Anyway.

660
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:41,030
Speaker 1: So, uh, we're going to talk about the playdate, which, full disclosure, I do not have and currently have not ordered.

661
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:46,970
Speaker 1: Like, I do not plan to get one, but I do think this concept is super intriguing and I'm very interested in it.

662
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:53,310
Speaker 0: So, the deal is, as a company, which you may not realize, uh, is called Panic, right?

663
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,376
Speaker 0: Like, "Oh, I'm panicking.

664
00:44:54,537 --> 00:44:55,744
Speaker 0: Oh, holy crap, my house is on

665
00:44:55,784 --> 00:44:56,005
Speaker 0: fire.".

666
00:44:56,045 --> 00:44:56,689
Speaker 0: Panic, right?

667
00:44:57,392 --> 00:45:02,170
Speaker 0: Um, the Panic company makes, right, some, some development tools.

668
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,530
Speaker 0: They have a thing called Nova, which is like a code editor for the Mac, right?

669
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,789
Speaker 0: I guess if you don't want to use one of the popular ones.

670
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:14,890
Speaker 0: They got one called Transmit, that's a SFTP/FTP/S3 file transfer client for Mac.

671
00:45:15,592 --> 00:45:18,607
Speaker 0: They got a thing called Prompt, which is an SSH client for IOS.

672
00:45:20,013 --> 00:45:22,110
Speaker 0: I use Blink Shell, I don't use Prompt.

673
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:30,910
Speaker 0: They also, though, in addition to making development tools, 'cause clearly they're programmers who make programming tools, they use those programming tools to make games.

674
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:33,349
Speaker 0: Now, you've heard of these, well, at least two of them.

675
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:39,830
Speaker 0: They've made a game called Nower, Play With Your Food, an interactive exploration into the aesthetics of food.

676
00:45:39,932 --> 00:45:40,627
Speaker 0: I never heard of that.

677
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:45,670
Speaker 0: But they've also made Firewatch and Untitled Goose Game.

678
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,929
Speaker 0: Those are the two games that they've made.

679
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:52,290
Speaker 1: Two games that, if I had to describe them in one word, they are both each a triumph.

680
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,173
Speaker 0: Yes.

681
00:45:54,193 --> 00:46:05,390
Speaker 0: So, now, they have ventured into the realm of hardware, and have made a handheld video game system in cooperation with Teenage Engineering.

682
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,870
Speaker 0: You can go to the website for Teenage Engineering if you're not familiar with them.

683
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,269
Speaker 0: I think we've mentioned them on the show at least once before.

684
00:46:12,531 --> 00:46:20,669
Speaker 0: They make a lot of, you know, very nicely designed hardware with a particular aesthetic to it.

685
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:28,049
Speaker 0: You know, very sort of a DIY, but still slick and stylish kind of combination going on.

686
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:37,166
Speaker 0: They've got a really nice, if you want to make a mini-ITX computer, it's 200 bucks, but they've got a really nice, like, flat-pack, like, steel case.

687
00:46:37,186 --> 00:46:37,829
Speaker 0: you can put it in.

688
00:46:38,772 --> 00:46:44,410
Speaker 0: You know, you can only put a tiny power supply in there, but, you know, I'd put a computer in there, right?

689
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:46,110
Speaker 0: I don't know, for 200 bucks, but, you know.

690
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:53,450
Speaker 1: Well, they're going to release soon the stereo dock where you slide the Playdate into the front, and now it's a little cube that sits on your desk and has a big speaker.

691
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,990
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you know, but I'm talking about Teenage Engineering and the things that they make, right?

692
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:01,249
Speaker 0: They make a lot of synthesizer things and stuff like that.

693
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:06,610
Speaker 0: Okay, but the Playdate itself is a handheld game console, much like a Game Boy.

694
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,616
Speaker 0: It's got a D-pad, an A and a B button, right?

695
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:16,150
Speaker 0: A speaker, you know, it's got a USB-C connector, a headphone hole, a screen.

696
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,810
Speaker 1: You're leaving the most fascinating thing for last, clearly.

697
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:24,930
Speaker 0: Well, look, but on top of all that, it's got Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, right?

698
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:25,873
Speaker 0: Pretty impressive.

699
00:47:26,475 --> 00:47:30,350
Speaker 0: An internal battery that just recharges and lasts a really long time.

700
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:34,221
Speaker 0: And the number one feature it has is the crank.

701
00:47:34,322 --> 00:47:37,050
Speaker 0: On the right side of this thing is this crank.

702
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,350
Speaker 0: You can flip it out and crank it forward or backwards, right?

703
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,910
Speaker 0: Clockwise or counterclockwise, but it's really towards you or away from you.

704
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:48,390
Speaker 1: I haven't touched one yet, but I imagine the crank feels really good.

705
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:58,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, this, as physically constructed, like, it's not super, like, tough and solid, but it's, like, pretty good, right?

706
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:04,463
Speaker 0: You know, like, I pre-ordered the thing, right?

707
00:48:04,663 --> 00:48:07,390
Speaker 0: And so it showed up, and I guess they're slowly rolling them out.

708
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:10,257
Speaker 0: But, yeah, it's, like, it's pretty solid.

709
00:48:10,297 --> 00:48:14,010
Speaker 0: You're not, you know, the crank itself, you don't feel like this crank is going anywhere.

710
00:48:14,835 --> 00:48:16,930
Speaker 0: You can crank it, you know, with confidence.

711
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:24,830
Speaker 0: I think the major flaw in the device, really, is that it's kind of thin, which is actually very nice.

712
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:25,893
Speaker 0: It's nice and small, right?

713
00:48:25,913 --> 00:48:31,150
Speaker 0: It's, like, a square, and it's maybe, like, not even a centimeter thick, barely, right?

714
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:37,526
Speaker 0: And the buttons are really good, but it's not very ergonomic to hold.

715
00:48:37,586 --> 00:48:38,690
Speaker 0: It's just a flat square.

716
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:40,055
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of complaints about that.

717
00:48:40,095 --> 00:48:43,990
Speaker 1: People can't play it for more than an hour, or their thumbs or their wrists start to hurt.

718
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:47,641
Speaker 0: Yeah, the crank is, like, on the side, and it's, like, you know, in the way a little bit.

719
00:48:47,702 --> 00:48:50,250
Speaker 0: if you're trying to play with just the buttons normally, right?

720
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:55,430
Speaker 0: And when you go for the crank, you're, like, you're trying to hold the device with your left hand and crank with your right hand.

721
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,689
Speaker 0: And it's, like, you know, it's sort of tough to do that.

722
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:04,390
Speaker 0: And then if you're left-handed, there's, like, there's, like, upside-down modes and other accessibility modes.

723
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,910
Speaker 0: But, like, you've got to turn the thing upside-down, and now you can crank.

724
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:13,150
Speaker 0: But if there's a game that requires crank plus buttons, left-handed people are going to be in trouble, right?

725
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:14,778
Speaker 0: Because the crank is on the right side.

726
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:17,390
Speaker 0: So that's another issue.

727
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:22,230
Speaker 0: So it's not perfect, but, you know, considering what it is, it's pretty impressive.

728
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:29,010
Speaker 0: It's also surprisingly open, right, in terms of it's very well-documented.

729
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:31,581
Speaker 0: They've got all these SDKs and APIs.

730
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:33,510
Speaker 0: You can make software for it, no problem.

731
00:49:34,092 --> 00:49:37,364
Speaker 0: You can push a button combination and mount it like a USB drive.

732
00:49:37,404 --> 00:49:38,890
Speaker 0: It has four gigabytes of storage.

733
00:49:39,392 --> 00:49:43,530
Speaker 0: You can just put files on there, take files off, hope you don't mess it up, right?

734
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:48,550
Speaker 0: And, you know, software-wise, it's, like, oh, it's actually pretty strong.

735
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,930
Speaker 0: It's, like, you can do whatever the hell you want with this thing, right?

736
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:58,990
Speaker 0: Side-loading other, you know, games, you know, go buy a game on itch.io and then load it in there, make a game, load it in there, right?

737
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,667
Speaker 0: Whatever you want.

738
00:50:01,591 --> 00:50:09,330
Speaker 0: But if you're not a software engineer who's going to make software for this, what is, you know, what, like, what are you going to play on here, right?

739
00:50:09,754 --> 00:50:10,690
Speaker 0: You know, what's the point?

740
00:50:12,691 --> 00:50:20,810
Speaker 0: So the point is, is that they got some cute little games that are not available on literally any other platform whatsoever, right?

741
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:30,810
Speaker 0: It's, like, you know, I guess you could run their little, you know, the same simulator they have, you know, for development and try to load games into that and play them, right?

742
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:33,629
Speaker 0: But you'll have to use, like, an on-screen crank, right?

743
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:39,689
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like, you know, pirating a DS game and you don't have a stylus or a touch screen or anything.

744
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:44,910
Speaker 0: It's, like, you can't really play it or pirating Wii Sports and you don't have any Wiimotes.

745
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:50,110
Speaker 0: It's, like, can't really, pirating Duck Hunt, that, you know, it's, like, you need, you need the crank, right?

746
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:55,590
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you could make a crank of some kind and play with that or get some other analog.

747
00:50:55,711 --> 00:50:58,910
Speaker 0: You could get an Atari paddle, maybe, as long as it can spin forever.

748
00:50:59,594 --> 00:50:59,986
Speaker 0: I don't know.

749
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:04,290
Speaker 0: You glue a little stick to the side of the Atari paddle and then maybe make a crank.

750
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:11,250
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, yeah, what are you going to do with it if you're not developing software?

751
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,530
Speaker 0: Well, you're going to play the games other people have made, right?

752
00:51:14,314 --> 00:51:15,109
Speaker 0: That's what you're going to do.

753
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:18,410
Speaker 0: So besides, I haven't sideloaded or downloaded any games.

754
00:51:18,971 --> 00:51:33,990
Speaker 0: And if you don't do that, the way it works is that when you first buy the device and turn it on, there will be two games already there for you and it connects to Wi-Fi and it'll update its OS and update its own games.

755
00:51:34,477 --> 00:51:35,086
Speaker 0: Right for you.

756
00:51:36,211 --> 00:51:41,930
Speaker 0: And so those two games that it comes with out of the start are Casual Birder, which is sort of like an RPG.

757
00:51:42,331 --> 00:51:49,090
Speaker 0: Like you walk around talking to people, but you also take pictures of birds and you have to use the crank to focus the camera.

758
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:53,890
Speaker 0: And it's a little bit of like a, you know, it's a challenge to try to get some of these birds in focus, right?

759
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,750
Speaker 0: Because they're moving fast and you can only aim your camera a part of the screen.

760
00:51:58,271 --> 00:52:03,590
Speaker 0: You're trying to use the crank to focus and the D-pad to move the camera at the same time and push A to take the picture.

761
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:09,270
Speaker 0: It's somewhat, you know, challenging skill test other than, you know, the JRPG part where you walk around and talk to people.

762
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:11,750
Speaker 0: I'd say that's a good game, right?

763
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,890
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, I'll play it right.

764
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:23,250
Speaker 0: Another game, Whitewater Wipeout, is a surfing high score game, sort of like a Tony Hawk kind of deal.

765
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:28,470
Speaker 0: You're trying to surf and do flips in the air and whatnot, and you control it entirely with the crank.

766
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:39,890
Speaker 0: And, you know, when you get air, big air on the surfboard and you can spin the crank really fast to do a bunch of flips, sort of like a ski-free, I guess, a ski-free jump, right?

767
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:45,967
Speaker 0: And that part, you know, makes sense for the crank, you know, the mapping of the cranking to the surfboard doing 360s in the air.

768
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:53,250
Speaker 0: But when you're in the water trying to pick up speed, the crank is not good.

769
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:57,570
Speaker 0: It's like you much rather have the Atari paddle than the crank, right?

770
00:52:57,611 --> 00:52:58,570
Speaker 0: It's kind of annoying.

771
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:05,170
Speaker 0: So, you know, but it's just to try to get a high score, you know, do the best surf, right?

772
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,370
Speaker 0: With that before you wipe out game.

773
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:16,610
Speaker 1: But I think the real cool part is not necessarily any of these individual games that you've described, but the fact that it comes with a game season of 12 weeks.

774
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:17,589
Speaker 0: Right, that's what I was getting to.

775
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,890
Speaker 0: So you get those two games, you get those two games, right?

776
00:53:21,352 --> 00:53:23,410
Speaker 0: And those games are the start of season one.

777
00:53:24,152 --> 00:53:29,330
Speaker 0: And then on Monday, or at least I guess, I don't know exactly how it works, but for me it was Monday.

778
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:34,290
Speaker 0: The LED on the top of it lights up purple, right?

779
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:39,990
Speaker 0: Like I woke up and there was a purple, like different colored light coming out of the top of this, near the power button.

780
00:53:40,832 --> 00:53:42,342
Speaker 0: And it was like, "Hey, new

781
00:53:42,403 --> 00:53:43,269
Speaker 0: games!"

782
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:44,191
Speaker 0: Right?

783
00:53:44,332 --> 00:53:53,950
Speaker 0: And I pick it up and during the night it had loaded over WiFi two more games that were part of season one, which is included in the cost of the device.

784
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,310
Speaker 0: Like if you get the device, you get season one.

785
00:53:56,951 --> 00:54:04,110
Speaker 0: And someone else who got their console earlier than me has already received games from week three.

786
00:54:04,751 --> 00:54:15,610
Speaker 0: So it's like, even if you buy a playdate next year, you'll experience like this slow rollout of all the season one games, two games per week, a week at a time.

787
00:54:15,972 --> 00:54:16,173
Speaker 0: Right?

788
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:18,430
Speaker 0: So you don't just get all the games at once.

789
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,910
Speaker 0: You could go out and sideload them, find wherever they are somewhere and load them in.

790
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:29,330
Speaker 0: But if you just stick to the default experience, it's like, yeah, you're just caught, you know, it's like, and that goes with the name of playdate, right?

791
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,356
Speaker 0: It's like every week.

792
00:54:31,757 --> 00:54:34,625
Speaker 0: it's like, you know, it's like, "Hey, I'm shining this purple light.

793
00:54:34,746 --> 00:54:35,729
Speaker 0: Come poke at me a little

794
00:54:35,749 --> 00:54:35,929
Speaker 0: bit.".

795
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:36,210
Speaker 0: Right?

796
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:42,290
Speaker 1: And that's where I see like, I didn't get it, partly because I don't feel like it'll have a lot of staying power for me.

797
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:54,990
Speaker 1: But I'm intrigued by this idea because one, I'm a big fan of relatively low tech or easy to mess with hardware as a teaching tool and a learning tool.

798
00:54:55,551 --> 00:54:58,076
Speaker 0: I mean, the back of it has four screws.

799
00:54:58,096 --> 00:55:00,260
Speaker 0: You can take the back of this off and mess with it.

800
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,270
Speaker 0: I haven't opened it yet, but it's just four normal screws to open it up and see what's inside.

801
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:06,231
Speaker 1: Yep.

802
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:10,139
Speaker 1: But it's such good hardware and it's simple enough to where.

803
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:15,170
Speaker 1: this is what I would use in like a class to teach kids how to make games, like using the developer tools.

804
00:55:17,511 --> 00:55:24,388
Speaker 1: It's also an art project, like this idea of, "Buy this hardware, here's a season of little like small games to

805
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:24,649
Speaker 1: play.".

806
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:29,647
Speaker 0: I do think it's a lot more art software than game, right?

807
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:36,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, none of these are going to replace like Super Mario Land 2 on the original Game Boy or anything like that.

808
00:55:37,046 --> 00:55:38,830
Speaker 1: This is not that kind of game.

809
00:55:40,091 --> 00:55:44,196
Speaker 0: So the second week, the two games I got are Boogie Loops.

810
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:46,659
Speaker 0: So Boogie Loops is not a game.

811
00:55:46,779 --> 00:55:55,450
Speaker 0: It is basically Mario Paint Music Maker, but you can also, there's these dancing characters and you can control their dance to match your music in synchronization.

812
00:55:57,391 --> 00:55:58,696
Speaker 0: It's not very advanced.

813
00:55:58,796 --> 00:56:01,164
Speaker 0: Mario Paint Music might be more advanced.

814
00:56:01,927 --> 00:56:02,890
Speaker 0: It's hard to say.

815
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:06,584
Speaker 1: Well, remember, Mario Paint Music didn't have any animated characters.

816
00:56:06,965 --> 00:56:08,190
Speaker 1: You had to make a separate animation.

817
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:18,550
Speaker 0: This is literally just like, you know, like this five characters, Panda, Cactus, Pizza, Bunny, and maybe another one.

818
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,570
Speaker 1: It doesn't have sharps and flats?

819
00:56:21,815 --> 00:56:22,810
Speaker 0: It's really not complicated.

820
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,070
Speaker 1: Okay, because Mario Paint originally did not have sharps or flats.

821
00:56:25,411 --> 00:56:28,240
Speaker 0: So you have a line up at the top of all these characters.

822
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,150
Speaker 0: So let's say you set all the characters to be the pizza character, right?

823
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,171
Speaker 0: And then it's like.

824
00:56:32,252 --> 00:56:34,999
Speaker 0: you choose like, you know, there's a sequencer, right?

825
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:39,230
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the bar is moving from left to right and then looping back to the start again.

826
00:56:39,811 --> 00:56:40,993
Speaker 0: And you insert dances.

827
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:44,901
Speaker 0: You're like, do this, do the wave, then do this dance, then do that, right?

828
00:56:44,981 --> 00:56:49,210
Speaker 0: It's very, you know, it's not that exciting.

829
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:54,242
Speaker 0: I poked it for a minute and I was like, oh, it just makes loops really simply the end.

830
00:56:54,302 --> 00:56:54,823
Speaker 0: I'm good.

831
00:56:54,864 --> 00:56:56,889
Speaker 0: I see what you did there, you know.

832
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,132
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's a thing.

833
00:56:59,152 --> 00:57:06,510
Speaker 0: The most real game so far is Kranken's Time Travel Adventure, right?

834
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:10,179
Speaker 0: Which is basically, at first, I didn't understand this game.

835
00:57:11,322 --> 00:57:14,430
Speaker 0: There's this guy and he's got a date at three o'clock.

836
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,674
Speaker 0: He goes to his house.

837
00:57:17,616 --> 00:57:18,898
Speaker 0: All you do is crank.

838
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:20,621
Speaker 0: You don't do anything else.

839
00:57:20,901 --> 00:57:25,770
Speaker 0: You crank it and you see him in his house sleeping at three o'clock.

840
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:26,972
Speaker 0: The clock is in, right?

841
00:57:27,413 --> 00:57:30,400
Speaker 0: It's like you start cranking and time starts moving forward.

842
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,810
Speaker 0: He wakes up, he goes out of the house, he starts running to meet his date, right?

843
00:57:36,011 --> 00:57:43,130
Speaker 0: And at level one, you basically just crank forward and you get to the date and then she gets mad and like hits him or kicks him in the junk or whatever.

844
00:57:43,771 --> 00:57:52,363
Speaker 0: You can crank backwards to wind back the clock, but that doesn't wind back the time.

845
00:57:53,084 --> 00:57:57,110
Speaker 0: Even when you wind back the clock or even later for your date, right?

846
00:57:57,731 --> 00:57:59,133
Speaker 0: The time is moving forward.

847
00:57:59,514 --> 00:58:03,301
Speaker 0: You're just moving, you know, the dude on his walk, right?

848
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:04,343
Speaker 0: From left to right.

849
00:58:04,364 --> 00:58:07,730
Speaker 0: You're moving him forwards and backwards on this predetermined course.

850
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:15,062
Speaker 0: So I thought that I like failed, but it went to level two and I cranked forward and I succeeded at level two.

851
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:19,750
Speaker 0: and then level three, I cranked forward and I, you know, I didn't know that.

852
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,376
Speaker 0: I didn't think I succeeded because I got kicked in the nuts.

853
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:22,677
Speaker 0: Yeah.

854
00:58:22,717 --> 00:58:22,937
Speaker 0: Right.

855
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:28,050
Speaker 1: Um, well, it turns out it sounds like it's a Nidhogg situation, right?

856
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:32,998
Speaker 0: And level three, I cranked forward and, and you know, I got a different ending, right?

857
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:39,810
Speaker 0: It's like I, there was this butterfly and there was a little circle and it showed the girlfriend's face being upset.

858
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:42,677
Speaker 0: And I was like, I guess I didn't make it there in time.

859
00:58:43,098 --> 00:58:46,165
Speaker 0: You know, the, the butterfly was just indicating that she had left.

860
00:58:46,205 --> 00:58:47,368
Speaker 0: She had to wait for me, right?

861
00:58:47,448 --> 00:58:48,330
Speaker 0: Cause I was so slow.

862
00:58:48,931 --> 00:58:53,738
Speaker 0: So I'm like, do I need to improve my times at the other levels to get it, you know, to be fast enough?

863
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:54,840
Speaker 0: Like what do I need to do here?

864
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,085
Speaker 0: I thought I had failed right at levels one, two and three.

865
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:01,250
Speaker 0: Um, but apparently that's not the case.

866
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,414
Speaker 0: Getting kicked in the junk is actually success.

867
00:59:04,216 --> 00:59:11,190
Speaker 0: Um, and that's once I realized, yeah, once I realized that I realized, oh, I know how to play this game now.

868
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:16,356
Speaker 0: It's that I was failing the third level because I touched the butterfly.

869
00:59:16,717 --> 00:59:17,838
Speaker 0: That's why I failed.

870
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:28,070
Speaker 0: What you had to do was actually when you, you had to go right enough to the butterfly would appear and then go left, crank backwards.

871
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:31,116
Speaker 0: There were these flowers that he was stopping to sniff.

872
00:59:31,637 --> 00:59:37,308
Speaker 0: You have to stay sniffing the flower until the butterfly passes overhead, then crank forward again.

873
00:59:37,328 --> 00:59:38,330
Speaker 0: Right?

874
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:46,679
Speaker 0: So it's sort of a platformy obstacle game, but your only controls are move forward and backward.

875
00:59:47,059 --> 00:59:56,150
Speaker 0: And you have to use the environment to avoid these various attacking animals like herds of wild pigs and butterflies and birds.

876
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,211
Speaker 0: And right.

877
00:59:57,271 --> 01:00:02,999
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there's a desk that like he stops when there's, he gets to a cafe, it's actually like a chair and a table.

878
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:10,850
Speaker 0: When it gets to that, he'll sit in the chair, drink, take a sip, and then he'll jump over the table to go forward.

879
01:00:11,251 --> 01:00:18,343
Speaker 0: It's like when there's pigs running on the ground, you have to like get yourself up on the table and stop until the pigs go past.

880
01:00:19,005 --> 01:00:19,205
Speaker 0: Right?

881
01:00:19,646 --> 01:00:21,890
Speaker 0: So it's actually pretty clever.

882
01:00:22,631 --> 01:00:24,474
Speaker 0: I've only done like 10 or so levels.

883
01:00:25,596 --> 01:00:27,478
Speaker 0: Other people have done tens of levels.

884
01:00:27,518 --> 01:00:35,070
Speaker 0: I don't know how many total levels there are, but it's actually kind of a kind of a game, you know, kind of interesting.

885
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:36,251
Speaker 0: You know, good idea.

886
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:37,253
Speaker 0: Good execution.

887
01:00:37,894 --> 01:00:43,323
Speaker 0: I think the one thing all these games have in common is just, you know, artistically, right?

888
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:47,510
Speaker 0: The visuals and the sounds are really, really well crafted.

889
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:59,804
Speaker 0: And I think this is the thing that stood out to me when I was like trying to just make like a hello world software for this is that the screen is literally one bit color.

890
01:00:59,964 --> 01:01:01,186
Speaker 0: It's black or white.

891
01:01:01,526 --> 01:01:03,509
Speaker 0: You can't make a gray pixel, right?

892
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:04,170
Speaker 0: That's it.

893
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:07,395
Speaker 0: But the resolution is actually significant.

894
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:16,210
Speaker 0: It's like 440 by 220 or something, and the pixels are small, so you can make a pretty high resolution thing on there.

895
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:21,398
Speaker 0: It's not easy to draw something compelling, right?

896
01:01:21,638 --> 01:01:27,228
Speaker 0: It actually, you know, takes a lot of artistic skills to, you know, do these smooth animations.

897
01:01:27,288 --> 01:01:28,430
Speaker 0: The frame rates are really good.

898
01:01:28,971 --> 01:01:32,275
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of ghosting on the animation, right?

899
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:44,610
Speaker 0: So to make, you know, animated characters and scenes, right, with only black and white and with that high refresh rate is kind of a challenge.

900
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:50,526
Speaker 0: And a lot of, you know, the demo, like when you turn the device on for the first time is actually pretty impressive looking.

901
01:01:50,566 --> 01:01:51,408
Speaker 0: Like someone made that.

902
01:01:51,429 --> 01:01:51,890
Speaker 0: It's like, wow.

903
01:01:52,531 --> 01:02:02,070
Speaker 0: That's that, you know, you think, you know, in 2022, you're supposed to be impressed by like highest resolution 3D CG shit that looks like real life.

904
01:02:02,591 --> 01:02:08,802
Speaker 0: But I was more impressed by these one bit high resolution things going on here.

905
01:02:08,882 --> 01:02:12,749
Speaker 0: So, yeah, that's, you know, that's a thing.

906
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:17,639
Speaker 0: So would I buy this play date again?

907
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:23,350
Speaker 0: I mean, I would because I'm a person who can mess with it and make software for it and whatever.

908
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:32,550
Speaker 0: If you're not, you know, it costs one hundred and eighty bucks and that's without any accessories or anything.

909
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:44,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the reason I avoided it was partly just that even though it's tiny, I'm trying to avoid collecting any more physical stuff unless I am going to use that stuff for a very long time or have something.

910
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:45,990
Speaker 1: I've been using it for it.

911
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:47,554
Speaker 0: So I think it's cool.

912
01:02:47,794 --> 01:02:53,429
Speaker 1: I'll probably acquire one to poke at at some point, probably when someone else is done with theirs.

913
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:53,870
Speaker 1: But we'll see.

914
01:02:54,751 --> 01:03:00,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, one hundred eighty bucks is a lot for what this is, even considering you get the season of games.

915
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:03,710
Speaker 0: I do really like, though, the season of games concept.

916
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:04,031
Speaker 0: Right.

917
01:03:04,091 --> 01:03:04,472
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

918
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:10,325
Speaker 0: How many times do you go buy a bundle of games and you don't even play all of them?

919
01:03:10,566 --> 01:03:10,906
Speaker 0: Right.

920
01:03:11,147 --> 01:03:12,530
Speaker 0: You know, like whatever.

921
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:21,464
Speaker 0: And it's like having a system that automatically is like, imagine if you didn't have any.

922
01:03:22,005 --> 01:03:24,990
Speaker 0: you just like you took your steam library and it's hidden from you.

923
01:03:25,831 --> 01:03:31,522
Speaker 0: And then on Monday it comes out and is like, hey, here's one game.

924
01:03:31,702 --> 01:03:32,764
Speaker 0: This is your game for the week.

925
01:03:32,824 --> 01:03:34,467
Speaker 0: This is your new fresh game.

926
01:03:34,507 --> 01:03:35,850
Speaker 0: It would seem fresh, new and exciting.

927
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:36,611
Speaker 0: Right.

928
01:03:37,012 --> 01:03:47,248
Speaker 0: And if that game was not some big giant game, like, you know, Skyrim or something, but was like a small amusement of just like a few minutes or an hour or two.

929
01:03:48,951 --> 01:03:49,211
Speaker 0: Right.

930
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:53,439
Speaker 0: It would be like, oh, it's sort of like the Sunday crossword puzzle almost.

931
01:03:53,499 --> 01:03:53,720
Speaker 0: Right.

932
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:58,268
Speaker 0: It's like this thing you do for a small period of time every week.

933
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:59,070
Speaker 0: Right.

934
01:03:59,230 --> 01:03:59,851
Speaker 0: There it is.

935
01:03:59,972 --> 01:04:01,093
Speaker 0: It's compartmentalized.

936
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:05,761
Speaker 0: It's a fresh thing that happens and then it's gone and out of mind.

937
01:04:05,781 --> 01:04:06,583
Speaker 0: Right.

938
01:04:06,923 --> 01:04:10,570
Speaker 0: It's not some thing you have to dedicate to or invest in.

939
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:11,331
Speaker 0: Right.

940
01:04:11,692 --> 01:04:13,254
Speaker 0: But then you forget about it.

941
01:04:13,855 --> 01:04:15,118
Speaker 0: But then it comes back again.

942
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:15,639
Speaker 0: Right.

943
01:04:15,739 --> 01:04:21,910
Speaker 0: A week later, like, hey, here's another little video game that's, you know, for you to enjoy for an hour or whatever.

944
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:22,371
Speaker 0: Right.

945
01:04:22,451 --> 01:04:24,215
Speaker 0: I'm blinking my purple light again at you.

946
01:04:24,275 --> 01:04:25,759
Speaker 0: Hey, hey, listen.

947
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,240
Speaker 0: Right.

948
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:30,350
Speaker 0: It's like, that's a pretty good model for the times we live in.

949
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:40,550
Speaker 1: And also it's just the kind of device, like the whole thing as a package, like you said, it's almost more an art project or an art piece than it is a gaming console.

950
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:46,500
Speaker 1: And I'm glad it exists, even though I don't necessarily want to get one or at least not pay full price for one.

951
01:04:47,402 --> 01:04:50,730
Speaker 1: And I really want to see if anyone does some fun, cool stuff with this.

952
01:04:51,631 --> 01:04:53,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do think there is potential.

953
01:04:53,498 --> 01:04:56,830
Speaker 1: I think you can see a lot of these like coding summer camps down the road.

954
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:05,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do think there's a lot of potential here, but at least the four games I've played, you know, the potential has not yet been fulfilled.

955
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,535
Speaker 0: There might be other games coming down the line.

956
01:05:07,716 --> 01:05:08,638
Speaker 0: We'll see what's what.

957
01:05:11,064 --> 01:05:13,129
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's, you know.

958
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:20,390
Speaker 0: If you're the right kind of person that this is for, then you probably have already pre-ordered one.

959
01:05:22,611 --> 01:05:32,690
Speaker 0: And if it's not, it's like, all right, you know, it's a cool thing that if you got, I don't know, a bunch of extra money, you could probably do it for the hundred eighty bucks.

960
01:05:32,871 --> 01:05:33,071
Speaker 0: Right.

961
01:05:33,091 --> 01:05:38,530
Speaker 0: You could buy like three sixty dollar AAA video games.

962
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:44,869
Speaker 1: I mean, for that much money, you could buy a used GBA probably and a pile of like old cartridges for it.

963
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could buy like a used GBA and a flash cart.

964
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:49,430
Speaker 1: Yeah.

965
01:05:50,692 --> 01:06:04,090
Speaker 1: But I wonder, I mean, I don't know anything about the business side of it, but I would not be shocked if the long play is to sell these to schools and camps and like educational institutions more so than the consumer market.

966
01:06:05,473 --> 01:06:06,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

967
01:06:10,281 --> 01:06:12,527
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

Speaker 1: I'm really hungry, I gotta pick up some food right before I play Blades in the Dark right after recording this episode.

981
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,180
Speaker 1: So I simply leave you with an old classic that's gonna get stuck in your head.

982
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:16,170
Speaker 0: Grab that block of ice, lift it over your head, turn around then throw it in the ocean.

983
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:18,855
Speaker 0: Snap back, eyes straight, convey, convey.

984
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:21,380
Speaker 0: Ready your paws, here comes another cold one.

985
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:26,530
Speaker 0: Grab that block of ice, lift it over your head, turn around then throw it in the ocean.

986
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:29,195
Speaker 0: Snap back, eyes straight, convey, convey.

987
01:07:29,255 --> 01:07:31,740
Speaker 0: Ready your paws, here comes another cold one.

988
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:36,890
Speaker 0: Grab that block of ice, lift it over your head, turn around then throw it in the ocean.

989
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:39,515
Speaker 0: Snap back, eyes straight, convey, convey.

990
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,020
Speaker 0: Ready your paws, here comes another cold one.

991
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:47,230
Speaker 0: Grab that block of ice, lift it over your head, turn around then throw it in the ocean.

992
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:49,875
Speaker 0: Snap back, eyes straight, convey, convey.

993
01:07:49,915 --> 01:07:52,360
