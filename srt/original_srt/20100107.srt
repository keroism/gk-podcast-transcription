1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,109
Speaker 0: It's Thursday January 7th 2010.

2
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:20,720
Speaker 0: I'm Scott I'm rim, and this is geek night tonight our triumphant return of questioning and answering.

3
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:32,289
Speaker 1: Holy crap we're back.

5
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:32,610
Speaker 0: No.

6
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,952
Speaker 0: We're not.

7
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:34,939
Speaker 1: no never mind, okay?

8
00:00:36,642 --> 00:00:37,364
Speaker 1: It's been a while it.

9
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:37,866
Speaker 1: you know.

10
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:42,003
Speaker 1: we did geek nights for so freaking long that it got to the point almost to where I Felt.

11
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:45,533
Speaker 1: I wasn't tired of doing the show But it was like a time to do the show.

12
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:49,159
Speaker 1: it was kind of this job I was doing especially back when it was still four nights a week every week.

13
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:57,009
Speaker 0: Well, I think another part of the thing is that you know we're not like a news show like say twit where they can just Look at the news every week and do a show.

14
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:04,580
Speaker 0: or you know we're not a show on one particular Topic where we can just you know look at the internet and get a feed of things come in.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,404
Speaker 0: I guess the thing of the day.

16
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:25,880
Speaker 1: we can do that, but basically for our show we need to Build things up within ourselves in order to create shows and after you know since 2005 of doing this some 700 episodes including the the famous I feel like I'd run out of mana.

17
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:29,980
Speaker 1: So I don't we had to back up and let the mana recharge slowly like in those shitty old games.

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,176
Speaker 0: You know I'm playing one of those shitty games that torchlight game.

19
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:35,793
Speaker 0: right now It's basically Diablo click click click.

20
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:38,951
Speaker 1: You know I'll say this I almost bought it because it was so cheap.

21
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:43,488
Speaker 1: I was like I'd pay five bucks Like it is a stupid clicky game.

22
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:53,380
Speaker 0: right, but the price of five bucks the production value of this game Is obviously at least a $20 game, so it's pretty right, but the thing is it's you know to make the Diablo torchlight joke.

23
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:57,460
Speaker 0: Basically we did not bring enough mana potions, so we had to use the town portal.

24
00:01:57,936 --> 00:01:58,462
Speaker 1: Yeah Well more.

25
00:01:58,482 --> 00:02:01,820
Speaker 1: it was like Final Fantasy 1 when I was trying to save up money for a silver sword.

26
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:06,958
Speaker 1: So I wouldn't go to that in until I had like one guy left, and he was almost dead.

27
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:15,919
Speaker 0: yeah So long to walk back and out again And you'd waste money on the inn and it was so much more efficient to stay out in the field as long as possible.

28
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,460
Speaker 1: of Course one time I remember wasn't me was my little brother.

29
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:21,034
Speaker 1: He was doing something like that, and he stayed out too long.

30
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:22,240
Speaker 1: He got hit by some ghouls.

31
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:23,954
Speaker 1: They paralyzed his last guy, and he died.

32
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,277
Speaker 0: that's the one thing I hate is like you stay out there, but you're like.

33
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:30,000
Speaker 0: okay I could go back now But maybe I could stay out for one more.

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,740
Speaker 0: But on the way back after I fight one more will there be a random encounter before I actually get in the town?

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,363
Speaker 0: So you know what you do.

36
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:39,499
Speaker 0: you just walk around the town in a circle, so you're always one away from it.

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,256
Speaker 1: Yep, y'all back and forth the two squares in front of canaria.

38
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:42,839
Speaker 0: That's right.

39
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:45,397
Speaker 0: Welcome to canaria.

40
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:47,628
Speaker 1: Wow, I've read that in a while.

41
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,217
Speaker 0: I've been reading it all the time.

42
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:54,960
Speaker 0: Snow cones, okay, I'm like a year behind on that, but I actually added some new web comics.

43
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,747
Speaker 1: We had the commute and we had all that stuff.

44
00:02:56,788 --> 00:03:01,004
Speaker 1: so basically we're getting to the point to where we needed time off to set Our lives straight.

45
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:02,629
Speaker 1: and the lives are straight.

46
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:06,159
Speaker 1: the geek night studio is now in Long Island City right next to Manhattan.

47
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:08,066
Speaker 0: in fact We can see nothing else in this.

48
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:09,632
Speaker 0: behind this apartment is straight.

49
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:10,033
Speaker 0: No.

50
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:10,816
Speaker 1: I don't have any.

51
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:18,055
Speaker 1: you realize our apartment we have a bed and Boxes everywhere and the only room that is put together is the studio.

52
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:19,540
Speaker 0: my apartment is on that.

53
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:20,907
Speaker 1: You've been living in yours longer.

54
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:23,039
Speaker 0: It didn't take me that long to get it all set up.

55
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, well we got more stuff.

56
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:25,038
Speaker 0: That's right.

57
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,620
Speaker 1: plus I had to build the stupid studio, and now I got to build a new computer.

58
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:29,179
Speaker 0: I got rid of my stuff.

59
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,253
Speaker 1: But you know we always talk about the late show.

60
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:35,915
Speaker 1: you get like the background And it's always like some fake cityscape, or you get like a green screen.

61
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:36,799
Speaker 1: you show Manhattan.

62
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,223
Speaker 0: well Well, we're David Letterman who like records the show like 9 in the morning You know.

63
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:46,380
Speaker 0: so it's like and he's not even like high up, so he just puts like a fake cityscape behind.

64
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:52,334
Speaker 0: We are actually capable of Producing a nighttime show with a real cityscape out the window.

65
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:56,774
Speaker 1: in fact the only reason I can't see Manhattan right now is because I have the shades down.

66
00:03:56,795 --> 00:04:01,600
Speaker 0: yep Well actually from your sitting position you wouldn't not be able to see Manhattan.

67
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:03,509
Speaker 1: I could were I to put a mirror up.

68
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,720
Speaker 0: you could see like Queens and maybe some Brooklyn.

69
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,677
Speaker 0: Yes, a mirror perhaps would allow you to see Manhattan's.

70
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:13,520
Speaker 1: well Yes, however one thing I'm gonna do get a new boom and I'm gonna face the other way the boom.

71
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:15,087
Speaker 1: I'm getting a boom.

72
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:21,140
Speaker 1: get the big bottle boom But I own a multi pass now in a New Yorker.

73
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:23,829
Speaker 0: No, it's more like a single pass you had.

74
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:29,185
Speaker 0: I had the multi pass before when it was Metro north and Metro still a multi pass.

75
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,931
Speaker 1: Metro north train not metronome.

76
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,055
Speaker 0: It doesn't let you get on train.

77
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:34,743
Speaker 1: Let's begin on subway trains and Buses.

78
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:35,651
Speaker 0: that's pretty much it.

79
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:36,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's two things.

80
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:43,419
Speaker 0: Okay, multi sure You get on the path train or the air train.

81
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:51,114
Speaker 1: It's weird how much I was looking forward to you in the show to be honest like it When we first I was always like really excited about geek night because I had a lot to say.

82
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:53,465
Speaker 1: and as time went on It was I don't know.

83
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:55,979
Speaker 1: I wasn't as excited about the show as I am right now.

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,260
Speaker 0: Well, that's because basically you didn't have you know, it's like it's like a glass half empty half full situation, right?

85
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,220
Speaker 0: So basically our glass of stuff to do shows with our material was running low.

86
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:10,860
Speaker 0: So doing a show meant you had to like scrape the bottom of the barrel.

87
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,820
Speaker 0: But then we just didn't do shows and it rained and it poured.

88
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:16,790
Speaker 0: So now I like the cup overflow with.

89
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,580
Speaker 0: so you're like, yeah, we'll do a show.

90
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:21,172
Speaker 0: Look, I can just sort of hit this water fucking everywhere.

91
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:21,775
Speaker 0: It's easy.

92
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:23,262
Speaker 1: What really did it I think was.

93
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:26,920
Speaker 1: there were the pre geek nights days when Scott and I had that house and beacon.

94
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,315
Speaker 1: We both had jobs and nothing else to do at all.

95
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:39,859
Speaker 1: We would come home from work and like watch two movies play video games for like three hours Play a board game and then be bored for an hour.

96
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:48,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, we also filled up the cups mightily with the you know, five years of colleges Yep, so it was like six years of cup filling.

97
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:55,588
Speaker 0: So, you know, and then we were able to empty six years of Material in like four years of geek nights.

98
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:59,740
Speaker 0: So now we've had like a month or and change of filling.

99
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:00,719
Speaker 0: I think we'll be alright.

100
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:04,920
Speaker 1: But as Emily pointed out there were the pre geek nights days where we still had the big commutes.

101
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,366
Speaker 1: We didn't have anything else to do.

102
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,938
Speaker 1: then we had geek nights and the big commutes.

103
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,026
Speaker 1: now We have geek nights and no big commute.

104
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:17,748
Speaker 0: So we basically get those cup days and geek nights Sort of, you know We definitely are going to be able to this.

105
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:22,485
Speaker 1: last week the one day I came home and didn't like go shopping or like go To Home Depot or do house stuff.

106
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:27,060
Speaker 1: I came home and it's like I like seven hours before I have to go to bed.

107
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:29,867
Speaker 0: I watched all of master Keaton.

108
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:31,512
Speaker 0: I've watched all of.

109
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:34,240
Speaker 0: I've watched a lot more various anime series.

110
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:38,909
Speaker 1: I watched most of season 2 of Dexter and I read a lot of comic books.

111
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:39,932
Speaker 0: Oh, I need the photons.

112
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,658
Speaker 1: Give me I'm gonna watch it first.

113
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:42,300
Speaker 0: I need something.

114
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,130
Speaker 0: Just I might have to go back to Hokuto.

115
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,134
Speaker 0: no can if I don't get something.

116
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:48,482
Speaker 1: we got to review these shows that we're watching Before we forget.

117
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:55,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, I've been able to get a lot, you know, and because it can be saving so much time No commuting I'll be able to.

118
00:06:55,787 --> 00:07:03,480
Speaker 0: the cup will not run out as quickly because I'll be able to Continuously fill it with things because I have basically two hours a day that I did not have before.

119
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:08,500
Speaker 1: Sadly, what am I watching primarily right now goes to Michelle standalone complex again?

149
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:23,079
Speaker 0: so much.

150
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:29,875
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

151
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:31,123
Speaker 1: I haven't heard that music in a while.

152
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:32,330
Speaker 0: You didn't hear that music?

153
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,350
Speaker 1: No, I didn't thanks to the magic of automatic editing and the Scott completely destroying the illusion.

154
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:42,970
Speaker 0: No one hears that music but you geek nights is all about destroying illusions.

155
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,336
Speaker 0: All right, that's that's.

156
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:51,467
Speaker 1: maybe that should be the theme of our TED talk our TEDx talk The theme of TEDx destroying illusions and ruining your childhood.

157
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:55,235
Speaker 1: Yeah But things of the day.

158
00:08:55,436 --> 00:09:07,975
Speaker 1: and what could be more fitting because it is actually this weekend and I know you know Usually geek nights like maybe half of you guys listen the night it comes out and I see like this trail for two weeks The people downloading the episodes later.

159
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:14,900
Speaker 1: I know most of you are listening to this episode on Thursday night considering how much crap We've been getting about, you know, when are you gonna do a show?

160
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:17,070
Speaker 1: When's geek nights coming out games?

161
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:19,818
Speaker 1: I don't know.

162
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:30,762
Speaker 1: They didn't say so much about guns But it is this Sunday so you have time to prepare.

163
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:33,030
Speaker 1: it is my second favorite holiday in the world.

164
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:37,470
Speaker 1: It is that improv everything group and they're doing no pants day.

165
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:43,009
Speaker 0: Do they realize like the NFL playoff starts and ride the subway with no pants?

166
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,639
Speaker 1: now There are some very important rules about this thing.

167
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,123
Speaker 0: one is you have to wear underwear But this is I don't know if your underwear accounts for him.

168
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:52,149
Speaker 0: It's basically a string.

169
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:55,290
Speaker 1: Well, see I have experience with this in my past.

170
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,778
Speaker 1: You know how you get away with wearing underwear in public.

171
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:09,250
Speaker 1: you wear whitey tighties or tighty whiteies Depending on where you're from on the bottom and then you are boxers over that thus preventing any chance of peekage or leakage.

172
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:27,477
Speaker 0: Leakage Because it rhymed Yeah, sure rim has no leakage, uh-huh Okay, but the the other rules are.

173
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:35,098
Speaker 1: you must be willing to take your pants off on public transit in public and to you Must be able to do this while maintaining a straight face.

174
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,659
Speaker 0: I can do that if it wasn't zero degrees out So fucking Oh God, it's so cold.

175
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:41,984
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

176
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:51,744
Speaker 0: woman woman woman I mean, it's not that woman today But there are so many days that have passed or we didn't do shows when we came where it was So woman we came back from freaking Albany.

177
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:52,870
Speaker 0: I thought I was in space.

178
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:55,543
Speaker 0: I thought I was in double space Emily and I came back.

179
00:10:55,664 --> 00:10:56,870
Speaker 1: I know Judith and Natalie's car.

180
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:58,210
Speaker 1: So they drove us for our tower place.

181
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:04,270
Speaker 1: We had to park like three blocks up and you probably parked on that street that goes to the the bridge the Queensborough Bridge.

182
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,309
Speaker 1: There's like a wind tunnel there.

183
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:06,912
Speaker 1: It was.

184
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:14,383
Speaker 1: not only was it like one degree but there was the solar anti woman wind coming at us the whole Woman, I was pro woman when it was anti man.

185
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:20,909
Speaker 0: as I boys wind If it froze the boys first the boys women off as space does.

186
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:24,648
Speaker 1: My love for you is deathless.

187
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:29,488
Speaker 0: Too bad for this omnipotent wind.

188
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,494
Speaker 1: But I am.

189
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:37,310
Speaker 1: if I go out on Sunday I will participate in this.

190
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:39,690
Speaker 1: I will take at least one picture of myself if you go out.

191
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:45,083
Speaker 0: No, I think the idea is that you're supposed to go get on the subway at two o'clock on purpose Depends on how cold it is.

192
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:50,870
Speaker 0: But the thing is what you can do is you can just get on the subway right and ride it like into Manhattan.

193
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:56,330
Speaker 0: Well, I might man time it such that like you're you're in Manhattan like downtown around two o'clock.

194
00:11:56,711 --> 00:12:01,070
Speaker 1: Well one thing I might have to go up to Beacon to deal with my car in which case that's road north.

195
00:12:01,912 --> 00:12:03,765
Speaker 0: I don't think you want to take your pants off on Metro north.

196
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:04,268
Speaker 1: Why not?

197
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:06,714
Speaker 0: It's a lot more strict.

198
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:08,521
Speaker 1: It's there's no law against it.

199
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,227
Speaker 0: No, I guess not.

200
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:11,632
Speaker 1: There's no rule against either The rule.

201
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:14,890
Speaker 0: there is a rule about going to jail for seven years if you fuck with the conductor.

202
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,588
Speaker 0: No, if you hit the conductor, yes, if you hit him with well, I guess that's true.

203
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:23,263
Speaker 1: I mean Do I do I hit him with my junk?

204
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:31,090
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, that's the thing It's like, you know I just remembered that your penis is so small that you wouldn't have a problem accidentally hitting the conductor if you took your pants off.

205
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,189
Speaker 1: Well, see the problem with Metro north is that it really wouldn't fit in those seats.

206
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:37,790
Speaker 1: I mean, I'd have to at least get the three across but the trains so crowded.

207
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:42,449
Speaker 0: Well, I would just you know, basically stay in the four-seater, you know both directions at once.

208
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:46,230
Speaker 0: Maybe you have to open up the vestibule door the whole time, but it'd be alright.

209
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:50,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is the trains that go up to Beacon on the weekends don't have enough cars.

210
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,289
Speaker 1: I Just remember the one time I was on the train.

211
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:03,094
Speaker 1: I think I was going to the Bronx for some reason because I'm gonna back when I worked there and this old man is Complaining the conductor.

212
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:04,220
Speaker 1: He's like, I'm an old man.

213
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,567
Speaker 1: I don't have to pay the peak fare.

214
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:06,190
Speaker 1: blah blah blah blah.

215
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:07,920
Speaker 1: The connectors like peak train.

216
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:09,490
Speaker 1: Everyone's got to pay the peak fare.

217
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:10,622
Speaker 1: There's no way around either.

218
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:12,480
Speaker 1: get off the train I'm gonna throw you off.

219
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:19,749
Speaker 1: and the guy was like You try and throw me off this train and he raises his cane Like he's gonna hit the conductor and the conductor just looks at him says go for it.

220
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:26,007
Speaker 0: I Man, I wish there was some law that was like if you hit Scott you go to jail for seven years.

221
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:27,393
Speaker 0: cuz I would just Be like, come on hit me.

222
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:27,834
Speaker 0: Yes.

223
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,984
Speaker 1: There is a trap if you become a conductor.

224
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,990
Speaker 0: I know maybe I think is conductor.

225
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:33,455
Speaker 0: I don't know.

226
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:34,969
Speaker 0: conductor make as much money as I do know.

227
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:38,168
Speaker 0: God no, and it doesn't look like that fun.

228
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:42,723
Speaker 1: But some of the people I found that one Jamaican guy has fun.

229
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:46,538
Speaker 1: that's true that's true Yeah But some of the people obviously do not enjoy their jobs.

230
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:51,656
Speaker 1: probably the guy taking the train like from Poughkeepsie to Manhattan at 11 at night on a Sunday.

231
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:52,940
Speaker 0: that somehow a thing of the day.

232
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:54,183
Speaker 1: I don't know.

233
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:55,628
Speaker 1: Yeah pants.

234
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:05,570
Speaker 0: All right No pants, so I'm just gonna start off, you know, I'm gonna ease back into the things that I've got So many great ones piled up, but I did not prepare any of them for the show.

235
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:08,710
Speaker 0: So I'd have to go, you know, look at my my backlog.

236
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:20,504
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna ease into the quality things of the day So as not to overload your senses with something too amazing after you know You being you know cold turkey on hilariousness for so long the secret.

237
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:23,072
Speaker 1: just go to College Humor 90%.

238
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:26,950
Speaker 0: I'm going to give you a College Humor video of the never-ending rooster.

239
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,664
Speaker 0: It is a rooster that crows for a very long time and that is it I could.

240
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:36,690
Speaker 1: I can imagine that the other roosters They're sitting there and they're like he starts to crow and they're like, who's this guy?

241
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,670
Speaker 0: I don't think there are any other roosters that he's pretty well.

242
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:44,509
Speaker 0: Obviously this rooster has eaten the rest of them You know and all the hands were just sort of like.

243
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,009
Speaker 1: Well, they're probably like shut up We know.

244
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:59,210
Speaker 1: So we figured we start this all off with questions because you guys love these question episodes and we wanted to try out Google moderator.

245
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:01,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I got a few things to say here, right?

246
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:08,844
Speaker 0: So first of all, right people love the question show Even though I sort of don't think the question show is that great because it gets very meta.

247
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:11,113
Speaker 0: not so good for the new listener Alright.

248
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:19,730
Speaker 0: second of all, you know in the question shows of the past We have selected the questions on our own and the thing when we select the questions.

249
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:26,444
Speaker 0: It's a good thing because a if we don't have a lot of things to say For a question like we don't have a good answer we can just skip it.

250
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:30,630
Speaker 0: if the questions stupid We can just skip it without having to make fun of the person who asked it.

251
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:36,190
Speaker 0: If there's like one person asking a hundred questions, we can just answer one per person.

252
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:47,290
Speaker 1: So it's spread out evenly across many different questioners But at the same time it causes the kind of echo chamber where I pick all the questions that are like Why do you like Horatio Nelson so much rim, right?

253
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:50,570
Speaker 0: So the thing is this time we try to use Google moderator.

254
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,950
Speaker 0: Google moderator is a tool that allows basically it moms a tool, right?

255
00:15:55,271 --> 00:16:11,530
Speaker 0: it's designed for like if you're going to have a conference or a speech or a lecture and People can ask questions beforehand or during the lecture if they have computers and internet connections or mobile phones or whatever and then Not only can they ask questions, but they can vote questions up or down.

256
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:25,630
Speaker 0: You know that other people have asked instead of being redundant right and thus the questions that most of the people want asked will be the ones that get answered as opposed to like You know the old lineup system where like whoever gets in line first is the person who asked their question.

257
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,830
Speaker 0: Even if they're a stupid question, everyone goes boo sit down sit down, right?

258
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:29,863
Speaker 1: I kind of like the idea.

259
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:33,210
Speaker 1: maybe at Connecticut I was thinking about this because we're gonna run like the one big panel room.

260
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:42,590
Speaker 1: we should set this up and have someone with a laptop who takes all the questions from people during the course of the lecture and Just types the good ones then just so we have a nice way to display them on the screen while we answer.

261
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,306
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you still need the voting of the.

262
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:47,050
Speaker 0: you know It only works if the people in the audience are in you know.

263
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,267
Speaker 1: Well, we could use it just as an easy way for the person in the audience to answer the questions regardless.

264
00:16:51,387 --> 00:17:13,826
Speaker 0: as an experiment We use this tool as you know to control the questioning for this episode and we got a hundred people Asking a hundred and twenty four questions with six thousand one hundred and fifty six votes Which if you think about the math is actually there should be 12,400 votes if everyone of all hundred people voted on every question.

265
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:29,851
Speaker 0: So basically About either half the people voted on all the questions or all the people voted on half the questions or somewhere in between And we're just gonna answer them in order if they all happen to be from the same person or if they're stupid or Whatever.

266
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:35,710
Speaker 0: We're just going to have to deal with that as we go until we're done and that will be this episode.

267
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:43,082
Speaker 1: I do want to give some thanks to the form I formerly known as your Lord Yupa who doesn't want to use that name But I feel like I should use it anyway, because that's the way we roll.

268
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:44,429
Speaker 0: Isn't that the guy from?

269
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,899
Speaker 0: Nasca is Lord Yupa.

270
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,074
Speaker 1: I Don't remember.

271
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:49,700
Speaker 1: Yes.

272
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:58,550
Speaker 1: Yes Anyway, but he actually went and grabbed all the questions people had typed into other places in the past and got them in here.

273
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,535
Speaker 1: It's kind of a set of seed.

274
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:06,130
Speaker 0: So if there is a question from him and it's stupid It might not actually be his question, but he did a lot of help here.

275
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,930
Speaker 0: So I gotta give props to him and so I yeah, I have to warn you in advance.

276
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,027
Speaker 0: We haven't done this in question episodes of the past, but we may make fun of your question.

277
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:18,810
Speaker 1: Yes So start out right away because a lot we're gonna do it in order skipping nothing.

278
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,130
Speaker 0: Yeah that and cuz everyone can see this page.

279
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:23,904
Speaker 0: So if we skip something or do anything everyone will know.

280
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:28,944
Speaker 1: so we cannot avoid Unless they continue to vote on them after we do the episode, I guess.

281
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:30,670
Speaker 0: but basically let's just go in order.

282
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,583
Speaker 1: All right, you want to start or shall I all right?

283
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:33,247
Speaker 0: We just have to read it.

284
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:36,040
Speaker 0: It says It's from Naito or at least that's.

285
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:43,410
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna read the name that's there Even though that's not necessarily the person who actually asked and he says do you think that your life would have been?

286
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,839
Speaker 0: Significantly different if you hadn't met each other.

287
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,690
Speaker 0: I assume he means me meeting you and vice versa.

288
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,150
Speaker 1: Well, if I hadn't met Naito, I mean I wouldn't have decided.

289
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:55,230
Speaker 1: You know, it's weird because there's two aspects to that.

290
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,750
Speaker 1: There's the rim and Scott meeting and then there's the like the whole front row crew coming together.

291
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:04,743
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that it's actually sort of a self-answering question.

292
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:07,110
Speaker 0: It's like would your life be different if your life was different?

293
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,511
Speaker 0: Why?

294
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:08,373
Speaker 0: yes, yes it would.

295
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:08,634
Speaker 0: but

296
00:19:08,674 --> 00:19:28,570
Speaker 1: then again some things are subtly different like had I on the morning of January 8th 2001 had pineapple juice instead of mango juice Probably not gonna matter so much in any scope of my life no matter how far out into the future Mmm, or like going to RIT versus going to Arizona State would have been a huge difference.

297
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:35,302
Speaker 1: Going to RIT and joining the anime club and our wag Versus going to RIT and joining the anime club our wag and CS house.

298
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,508
Speaker 1: Maybe not as big of a difference.

299
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:48,445
Speaker 0: Yep So, I mean, yeah, I mean, you know, there were other big decisions and I think that you know who you meet and such is Largely more a consequence than a than a cause.

300
00:19:48,807 --> 00:20:02,670
Speaker 1: but at the same time Even if myself and Scott had not met but the front row crew had formed either without me or without Scott I could see the crew being very similar because it seems like The thing that changed all of our lives was really just the formation of the front row crew.

301
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,301
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean mean pretty much no matter what.

302
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:07,230
Speaker 0: if I had gone to any college, right?

303
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:07,692
Speaker 0: I mean it was.

304
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:19,067
Speaker 0: I was already gonna go to a nerdy place, you know I was gonna meet a bunch of nerds, you know worst-case scenario None of those nerds are like really strong enough friends to still be friends after college.

305
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:19,910
Speaker 0: So what would have happened?

306
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:28,050
Speaker 0: I would have moved somewhere like New York City Anyway to get a tech job or San Francisco or something and it would add some nerd friends there, you know.

307
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:29,337
Speaker 1: Yes, it's really.

308
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:30,343
Speaker 1: it's not a matter of friends.

309
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:31,530
Speaker 1: It's a matter of the front row crew.

310
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:40,790
Speaker 1: it was I think the moment when like all of us as a group our lives really changed and became like kind of the I Was about to say like the force of righteousness and justice.

311
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,574
Speaker 1: but that doesn't really.

312
00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:56,490
Speaker 0: but I'm saying if you pick the point at which we met as sort of like a branching point in a in a you know, you know a Probability matrix tree, you know decision-making branching whatever if you pick that point is the point of diversion.

313
00:20:57,391 --> 00:21:04,610
Speaker 0: The the resulting, you know, like pad life paths that were in front of me were not too dissimilar.

314
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:11,170
Speaker 0: You know short of you know me deciding to go and do something crazy Which is within me and has nothing to do with our meetings.

315
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:20,410
Speaker 1: Yeah I would disagree on one front that the crew like the front row crew really There was that moment like after the first year of college when everyone was like gonna go back home for the summer and do that stuff.

316
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:29,745
Speaker 1: We all kind of stood around together and it kind of clicked that the front row crew wasn't just like all the other people at RIT who had like their group of friends that was gonna break up after they all left college.

317
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:41,550
Speaker 1: the front row crew kind of became Family And I think that is influenced If not myself and Scott specifically then the crew as a whole has influenced the crew as a whole in a kind of self replicating manner.

318
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:47,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean but that you know that happens if you have any people that you you know Stay close to for a long time.

319
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,123
Speaker 0: That's just.

320
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:49,150
Speaker 1: that's what it seems like.

321
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,551
Speaker 1: It's not.

322
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:54,890
Speaker 1: the rule out of college is that most people I've known don't seem to maintain a large group of their college friends.

323
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:57,866
Speaker 0: I think those are the people who have maintained their high school friends.

324
00:21:58,088 --> 00:22:02,105
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, like in community the guy with the the letter jacket.

325
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:12,050
Speaker 1: hmm anyway, so Where do you see the show and crew in the next five years taking into account the last five years from the head blood?

326
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,093
Speaker 0: That's a well.

327
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:14,680
Speaker 0: I think it's vampire hunter deep blood.

328
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,487
Speaker 1: I know but it's spelled for head blood.

329
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,050
Speaker 0: That's true.

330
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:24,889
Speaker 0: I think he's making a false assumption that the last five years Have an effect on the forward future five years in some.

331
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:28,023
Speaker 1: well They do in the sense that they're predictive.

332
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:29,630
Speaker 1: you can see you know what trends happen.

333
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,077
Speaker 1: I mean what happened the last five years.

334
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:42,795
Speaker 1: the crew that had formed that got really really close left our IT and went out into the real world and we spread out all over the place and then bit by bit we all Reconverged back on each other.

335
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:47,350
Speaker 1: everyone kind of moved far away and kind of said this sucks, and we all move back together.

336
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:49,099
Speaker 0: Let's see so five years.

337
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,210
Speaker 0: Let me 2015.

338
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,950
Speaker 0: I'll probably not moving for a while because I've got a. you know I paid a big fee to get the apartment.

339
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,890
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna keep the lease for a bunch of years to get the most out.

340
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,809
Speaker 0: You know because the longer I stay the more I get my money's worth for that fee.

341
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,465
Speaker 1: Yep, unless they build another building directly in front of this building.

342
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:09,550
Speaker 1: I don't see myself moving.

343
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,971
Speaker 0: Yeah, my job seems to be you know pretty good It's.

344
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:15,622
Speaker 0: it's probably not gonna fall apart like previous job.

345
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:19,209
Speaker 1: job wise it is not out of the realm But I'll be a millionaire by the end of five years.

346
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:22,659
Speaker 1: It's not that out of the far out of the realm.

347
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:23,724
Speaker 1: I'm pretty much confident.

348
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:26,331
Speaker 1: They'll be able to retire by the time I'm 45.

349
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:26,733
Speaker 0: That's that.

350
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:28,201
Speaker 0: well 45 isn't unreasonable.

351
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:34,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's some decent Millionaire in five years, then you could retire when you're like 30 something.

352
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:35,630
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

353
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,357
Speaker 0: It's about any.

354
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:38,955
Speaker 0: if I had any number of millions I would retire immediately.

355
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:42,470
Speaker 1: it is not out of the realm and it is surprisingly possible.

356
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:46,248
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it's that likely, but it is more possible than I would have expected five years ago.

357
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,635
Speaker 0: And I don't know what.

358
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:52,245
Speaker 1: well I mean let's we got to break it up the show and the crew.

359
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,570
Speaker 1: that's like asking about what?

360
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,306
Speaker 1: Your family gonna be like in five years, and what's your job gonna be like?

361
00:23:56,346 --> 00:23:56,749
Speaker 0: it's like.

362
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:01,540
Speaker 0: well You could all decide to send us a bunch of money So we can do this full-time if you really want to.

363
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,583
Speaker 0: you know it's up to you.

364
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:05,153
Speaker 1: well our maintenance costs increase Dramatically.

365
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:09,427
Speaker 1: this studio space per square foot is a lot more money than the studio space and beacon.

366
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:12,277
Speaker 0: that is true You know.

367
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:14,830
Speaker 0: I Don't know what else is gonna change.

368
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,975
Speaker 0: I mean I sort of you know.

369
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:19,770
Speaker 0: I really want to like you know start doing some more traveling action.

370
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,184
Speaker 0: So that will definitely occur.

371
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:27,881
Speaker 1: yep Well actually within five years I plan to take Three to six months off of work on sabbatical and go on a crazy journey.

372
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:34,645
Speaker 0: the convention schedule will probably sort of go into a summer Holding pattern you know doing less more powerful.

373
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:35,910
Speaker 1: We pretty much solidified.

374
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:41,010
Speaker 1: We're not adding any conventions except for possibly tech and gaming conventions that are really easy to do.

375
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,359
Speaker 0: I think the big the.

376
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:46,040
Speaker 0: I think the most difference That's gonna be in the next five years.

377
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:52,184
Speaker 0: is that because I'm not commuting There's gonna be a lot less shit talking and I'm gonna make a lot of things.

378
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:59,190
Speaker 0: and maybe there is a small Probability very small that one of those things could you know lead down an unexpected path?

379
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:00,205
Speaker 0: You know.

380
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:02,056
Speaker 0: But that's really.

381
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:02,760
Speaker 0: you know what else.

382
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,906
Speaker 0: what else is gonna happen?

383
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:07,409
Speaker 0: short of like I don't know a lottery win because I don't buy tickets.

384
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,315
Speaker 0: That could happen.

385
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:12,610
Speaker 1: well, I mean in terms of the crew you can find a lottery ticket on the ground.

386
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,981
Speaker 0: It's already a winner.

387
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:17,307
Speaker 1: in the last five years you know the crew kind of ballooned out and then came back together.

388
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:22,430
Speaker 1: and Just recently especially more and more the front row crew has been centering around, New York City.

389
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,400
Speaker 1: We've had a bunch of people like.

390
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,230
Speaker 1: we had friends in DC who moved up to Brooklyn.

391
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:30,630
Speaker 1: We had friends in the south who moved out to a lot white planes.

392
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:32,217
Speaker 1: Everyone's kind of converging.

393
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,589
Speaker 1: New York City is pretty much the center of the crew right now And then we have a couple people in Albany help people in Philly.

394
00:25:38,192 --> 00:25:43,830
Speaker 1: But it's all like the radius is New York City and I foresee it getting closer and closer as opposed to further and further.

395
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:47,295
Speaker 0: hmm Okay, the next question.

396
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,962
Speaker 0: Is it weird not living together anymore?

397
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:51,145
Speaker 0: miss anything.

398
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:54,637
Speaker 1: I don't miss having a bathroom Entirely covered in pubic hair.

399
00:25:54,978 --> 00:25:59,437
Speaker 0: I don't miss you know having all hair Absolutely everywhere.

400
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:00,502
Speaker 1: I don't miss pee on the floor.

401
00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:02,030
Speaker 0: You're the one who peed on the floor.

402
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:04,219
Speaker 1: Whose apartment has pee on the floor I have?

403
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:06,790
Speaker 0: first of all my apartment does not have pee on the floor.

404
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,593
Speaker 1: I was like it does.

405
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:14,981
Speaker 0: and second of all I would like to point out right that my apartment had no pee on the floor And then you stayed over like two times.

406
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:16,510
Speaker 0: then there was pee on the floor and I cleaned it.

407
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:18,430
Speaker 1: I thought you just said there was no pee on the floor.

408
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:22,290
Speaker 0: I cleaned it and there has not been pee on the floor since you have been there.

409
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,330
Speaker 0: You came and peed on my floor.

410
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,476
Speaker 1: So you say that but how come?

411
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:29,657
Speaker 0: there's no pee on my house and there is no pee on my floor since I cleaned it And I've been the only one there.

412
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:31,850
Speaker 0: It is only when you were there that pee was deposited.

413
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,613
Speaker 0: I don't believe you.

414
00:26:32,814 --> 00:26:35,082
Speaker 1: We'll have to go to your apartment and look at the pee.

415
00:26:35,263 --> 00:26:37,050
Speaker 0: I cleaned it and there is no pee anywhere.

416
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,693
Speaker 1: It's wait a week.

417
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:38,156
Speaker 1: I cleaned.

418
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:38,678
Speaker 0: it comes back.

419
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,066
Speaker 0: I cleaned it like a week ago.

420
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:40,930
Speaker 0: It's been a week already.

421
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,358
Speaker 0: Cleaned it two weeks ago.

422
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:43,962
Speaker 0: Honestly.

423
00:26:43,982 --> 00:26:45,090
Speaker 1: I don't think you guys understand.

424
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:47,950
Speaker 1: We live a couple of subway stops away from each other.

425
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,216
Speaker 1: We're basically next-door neighbors.

426
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:59,936
Speaker 0: the major difference is that when I see something awesome on the internet I have no one to tell immediately Yep, and I can't just walk into the other room be like hey check out this funny video You never walked into the other room.

427
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:05,053
Speaker 1: I'd be working on my computer and I hear hey rim rim Rim blah blah.

428
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:08,224
Speaker 0: see yes, blah blah brim or or even better.

429
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:19,509
Speaker 1: I'd be sitting there and I hear Until I finally yell, what's so funny?

430
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,510
Speaker 0: This funny thing that you must see immediately and stop doing whatever you are doing.

431
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:31,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's part of the reason why I took so long to edit the show back in the day Like as soon as we stopped the show, I'd like start to edit.

432
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,846
Speaker 1: I'm listening to the show and then next to me I have Scott basically doing another show.

433
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:39,373
Speaker 1: Yep Really it's not that different It's just.

434
00:27:39,414 --> 00:27:43,760
Speaker 1: it's kind of like we live in this gigantic Apartment building where we're like in the like.

435
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:46,290
Speaker 1: it takes almost no time for me to go to Scott's place.

436
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,246
Speaker 1: It's got to go to our place.

437
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,011
Speaker 0: That's it.

438
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:52,041
Speaker 1: It's not yeah, it's really I don't know what city live in.

439
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:53,827
Speaker 1: It's kind of just this modular lifestyle.

440
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:59,645
Speaker 1: Yeah What do you think are your greatest personal weaknesses and how have they manifested?

441
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:02,701
Speaker 1: by the way that previous question was Vega and this Question is from Nery.

442
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:06,157
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Well, I'm really just too awesome.

443
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:09,628
Speaker 1: And that is really prevented me from being not as awesome as I should be.

444
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:12,223
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm just too smart for my own good.

445
00:28:12,244 --> 00:28:26,490
Speaker 1: So You know, it's just actually I was thinking about this question and it actually gave me quite a bit of insight into all my successes By looking at them in the light of weaknesses like a personal weakness because I do have two very very important weaknesses.

446
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:32,243
Speaker 1: Scott has one peeing on the floor But weakness the first.

447
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:36,195
Speaker 0: weakness number one Rims peak is my.

448
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:37,580
Speaker 0: my floor is very.

449
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,881
Speaker 0: you know.

450
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:40,870
Speaker 0: rims pee is super effective against my bathroom floor.

451
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,290
Speaker 1: It's plus one against Scott floor.

452
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:59,563
Speaker 1: Yeah But my one weakness I have and this is the only one that's detrimental to me is that I'm incredibly Dangerously absent-minded like I will be sitting there and I'll be like, oh I have to pay this bill And then I will immediately forget like why I'm looking at my credit

453
00:28:59,583 --> 00:28:59,964
Speaker 0: card rim.

454
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:11,690
Speaker 0: Here is a check mail this Oh, yeah I'll just hide it under the stairs under a pile of crap and then the landlord will come and ask for the rent is and Rim will say he mailed it when he clearly did not.

455
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,800
Speaker 1: Or I'll be like, yeah, I'll build that e-commerce by next week.

456
00:29:16,302 --> 00:29:17,085
Speaker 0: Yeah by never.

457
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:18,730
Speaker 1: yeah, I just forget.

458
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:19,574
Speaker 1: I forget everything.

459
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:21,786
Speaker 1: I just I leave stuff everywhere and I forget everything.

460
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:24,556
Speaker 0: you also Don't do simple things like.

461
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:27,707
Speaker 0: there'll be something that will take two seconds and rim just I'll say do it now.

462
00:29:27,848 --> 00:29:30,619
Speaker 1: No No, no, it takes two seconds.

463
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:34,730
Speaker 1: Do it every time Scott tells me to do something that he says is simple It's always something really annoying.

464
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:37,500
Speaker 1: Good always be like our Google search or something.

465
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,110
Speaker 1: I don't care about and I have no intention of doing do it.

466
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,877
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's gotta be like rim.

467
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:43,826
Speaker 1: You got a Google this article and read it.

468
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:44,449
Speaker 1: I'm like now.

469
00:29:45,591 --> 00:29:46,316
Speaker 1: Do it right now.

470
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:48,410
Speaker 1: I don't care or I got to point out half the time.

471
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:48,753
Speaker 1: What do you do?

472
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:50,909
Speaker 1: that is because I'm like, I'm editing the show.

473
00:29:51,151 --> 00:30:02,777
Speaker 1: I am listening in my headphones to the show I'll find the part where I cough and in my and my other ear I hear rim blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Blah blah blah blah.

474
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,369
Speaker 1: It'll take two seconds blah.

475
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:06,513
Speaker 1: And then I keep.

476
00:30:06,694 --> 00:30:07,256
Speaker 1: don't you notice?

477
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:09,985
Speaker 1: I keep rewinding what I'm doing because I can't hear it.

478
00:30:10,486 --> 00:30:15,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, just pause pause button Open up the tab window.

479
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:26,340
Speaker 1: But I this made me realize something interesting because my other biggest weakness is that I procrastinate on Everything until the last possible second.

480
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:29,029
Speaker 1: I don't do shit until someone has a gun to my head.

481
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:32,987
Speaker 1: But I realized when I really thought about it that you know procrastinate at work.

482
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:39,549
Speaker 1: Yeah I Procrastinate like crazy at work and I'm always working on stuff.

483
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:48,370
Speaker 1: But like I don't work on any particular thing until like five minutes before it's due or before it's becoming a problem Oh, good job, but it's more than in life.

484
00:30:48,591 --> 00:31:04,009
Speaker 1: I always defer decisions to the last possible minute and I realized that this is very much given me the ability to capitalize on Circumstance in a huge degree because I never play my hand My hand is always kind of in my pocket and I forget about it and then suddenly someone's like rim.

485
00:31:04,491 --> 00:31:05,869
Speaker 1: You got to play a card like oh shit.

486
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:10,768
Speaker 1: But by then everyone else has played their cards and I just play the person are.

487
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:14,525
Speaker 0: so meanwhile You know the oh shit on the e-commerce was like six months ago.

488
00:31:14,565 --> 00:31:15,088
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

489
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:15,510
Speaker 0: Where is it?

490
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,949
Speaker 1: Oh that didn't benefit me in any way.

491
00:31:17,338 --> 00:31:27,047
Speaker 1: Oh, yes but I'm saying that all of my great successes have come out of the fact that I deferred decisions to a dangerous degree and As a result was able to capitalize on.

492
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:32,310
Speaker 1: crazy Circumstance that came up that I could not have capitalized on had I been more proactive.

493
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:34,117
Speaker 0: So not doing the?

494
00:31:34,257 --> 00:31:34,940
Speaker 0: what did you know?

495
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,767
Speaker 0: not doing the e-commerce what benefit?

496
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:37,710
Speaker 1: oh that didn't benefit me.

497
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,213
Speaker 1: I'm not saying.

498
00:31:38,454 --> 00:31:41,410
Speaker 1: I'm saying it's a weakness because it does not often benefit me.

499
00:31:41,752 --> 00:31:49,170
Speaker 1: However, the few times it has benefited me It has benefited me into in ways that have significantly altered my life for the better.

500
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:59,307
Speaker 1: It's this weird situation where our weakness kind of made me who I am today made everything awesome But makes a lot of non important things somewhat more problematic.

501
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:04,643
Speaker 0: Hmm I think my weakness is that is silver silver.

502
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:06,047
Speaker 1: I don't know.

503
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:06,830
Speaker 0: dragons vain.

504
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,650
Speaker 0: Is that if someone tells me to do something?

505
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:13,910
Speaker 0: I don't want to do it like even if I would have done it.

506
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:21,925
Speaker 0: Anyway, like if I'm gonna get in the grocery store and I'm gonna buy honey nut Cheerio and someone says Scott You should totally get honey nut Cheerios because of blah now.

507
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:24,234
Speaker 0: I don't want to get him I just won't get him.

508
00:32:24,616 --> 00:32:27,408
Speaker 0: just cuz someone told me to I don't see me not want to do it.

509
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:38,226
Speaker 0: and then Right, like if I come back to get honey Like I actually did want the honey nut Cheerios if I come back and get the next day to get the honey nut Cheerios I have to hide the honey nut Cheers, so they don't see that.

510
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:38,589
Speaker 0: I got it.

511
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:42,738
Speaker 0: I can't do anything that someone tells me to do it.

512
00:32:42,858 --> 00:32:45,466
Speaker 1: Actually, you know Scott don't give me five bucks.

513
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:49,410
Speaker 0: It's not gonna happen Because now there's nobody in my apartment.

514
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:54,328
Speaker 0: I can do things that people told me to do that I could not do when they were always watching, huh?

515
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,169
Speaker 1: You know, I kind of feel that a little bit.

516
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:57,552
Speaker 1: There's this.

517
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,790
Speaker 1: I guess I can see that weakness like I can understand it.

518
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:06,734
Speaker 1: It's kind of this whenever someone gives me advisor tells me to do something even if it's good advice I think for a second.

519
00:33:07,095 --> 00:33:11,530
Speaker 1: how stupid am I that I didn't think to do this and I think they're not better than me?

520
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:13,198
Speaker 0: No, it has nothing to do with that.

521
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,489
Speaker 0: It's just I don't want to do what anyone tells me to do at all.

522
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:18,082
Speaker 0: No, even if it's really good advice, I don't give a shit.

523
00:33:18,223 --> 00:33:19,590
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter if it's good or bad advice.

524
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,174
Speaker 0: So what do you?

525
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:21,101
Speaker 0: someone tells me to do it?

526
00:33:21,122 --> 00:33:21,525
Speaker 0: I don't want to.

527
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:22,190
Speaker 1: what are you gonna do?

528
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,755
Speaker 1: If you ever want to go to like a financial advisor That's a weird thing.

529
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:30,374
Speaker 0: it's like if I'm at work I have no problem doing what I'm telling to do Because they're paying you.

530
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:31,899
Speaker 0: I think it's just.

531
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,243
Speaker 0: you know, I don't know what it is.

532
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:35,953
Speaker 0: But if someone tells me what to do It's weird.

533
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,944
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's someone asked me to do something.

534
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:43,629
Speaker 0: I might say yes, I might say no It's you know, but if someone tells me what to do, I just don't want to do it.

535
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:50,269
Speaker 1: Oh, I also have all the obvious weaknesses, you know bullets knives Poison boobs.

536
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,275
Speaker 1: Yeah Not so much.

537
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:56,467
Speaker 1: I would say that that weakness boils down to cute art girls.

538
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,642
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I have a desperate weakness for cute art girls.

539
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:01,070
Speaker 1: Did I get her or Arthur?

540
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:01,591
Speaker 1: They are.

541
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,559
Speaker 0: did I do the last one or did you I did?

542
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:03,980
Speaker 0: All right.

543
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:06,410
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Scott not take the next question.

544
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:09,266
Speaker 0: There is always of talk.

545
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,302
Speaker 0: Okay, Zandro is the asker of this question.

546
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:16,132
Speaker 0: Zandro your grammar is fail Grammar.

547
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:20,389
Speaker 0: your fail is there is always of talk of smart people on the show.

548
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,435
Speaker 0: What is your definition of smart?

549
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:26,706
Speaker 0: someone who is intelligent and thinks for themselves or someone who agrees with you?

550
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:27,889
Speaker 0: Um, neither.

551
00:34:28,493 --> 00:34:31,330
Speaker 1: Well, I would say you want to go first.

552
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:43,643
Speaker 0: Yes, there are many things which make a smart person but I think the number one thing that makes a smart person is a a display of critical thinking ability.

553
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:56,670
Speaker 0: if someone can display You know and improve and demonstrate that they are capable of critical thinking Then they are well on the road to being a smart person and if they do not have that odds are very high.

554
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,142
Speaker 0: They are not what I would consider a smart person.

555
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:02,416
Speaker 1: I'll back it up to a slightly more Universal statement.

556
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:19,873
Speaker 1: I'd say I believe very strongly that The definition of intelligent people is that if you have a group of people a large group of people and they all have access to The same information on a given problem and they all agree on the same high-level goals Related to whatever.

557
00:35:19,894 --> 00:35:31,909
Speaker 1: the problem is that the intelligent people will all agree with each other on the path forward or they will disagree Not on the best way to achieve the goal But they will disagree on whether or not the goal should be achieved in the first place.

558
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:46,109
Speaker 1: I guess to boil it down all if everyone is equally informed and equally willing to critically think and examine data and Willing to be unbiased then all intelligent people will generally agree on most things.

559
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:50,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean you could put a bunch of stupid people in a room, and they might all agree on something.

560
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,636
Speaker 0: That's totally wrong.

561
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:54,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm saying that that's not a very good measurement at all.

562
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,058
Speaker 1: I didn't say it was a measurement.

563
00:35:55,078 --> 00:35:56,126
Speaker 1: I said it's just.

564
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:56,630
Speaker 1: it's a state.

565
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,598
Speaker 1: I feel that intelligent people will agree.

566
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,230
Speaker 0: so the definition of a smart person is someone who agrees.

567
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:02,573
Speaker 0: That's not really.

568
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:02,954
Speaker 0: you know.

569
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:05,561
Speaker 0: my definition of a smart person is some you know.

570
00:36:05,942 --> 00:36:08,550
Speaker 0: at the very least a smart person displays.

571
00:36:09,072 --> 00:36:11,826
Speaker 0: You know you know very strong critical thinking.

572
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:12,770
Speaker 1: what is critical thinking?

573
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,262
Speaker 1: I mean really just comes down to the ability to think critically.

574
00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:17,406
Speaker 1: is there a goal?

575
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:18,530
Speaker 1: if there is a goal.

576
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:25,910
Speaker 1: Are you able to understand the information that exists and able to make an intelligent decision regarding the achievement of said goal?

577
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,154
Speaker 0: Hmm yeah, but it's not all.

578
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:32,910
Speaker 0: but you know not everything in the world is is you know like achieving a goal?

579
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:38,637
Speaker 0: You know or or looking at information and coming up with an answer to something You know a lot of times.

580
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,542
Speaker 0: It's isn't it though.

581
00:36:39,803 --> 00:36:41,130
Speaker 0: No a lot of time a situation.

582
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,750
Speaker 0: Well that isn't well because you know you don't have information.

583
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:47,747
Speaker 0: It's sometimes it's the ability to observe and acquire information.

584
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:50,339
Speaker 0: a lot of people you know we'll look at something like.

585
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:56,024
Speaker 0: you know how many people sit in front of a computer right and You know I also look at that computer, and they don't know what.

586
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:57,130
Speaker 0: they can't figure out the problem.

587
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,772
Speaker 0: But I can.

588
00:36:57,812 --> 00:36:58,294
Speaker 0: and why?

589
00:36:58,314 --> 00:37:00,842
Speaker 0: because I read the screen and they don't.

590
00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:03,190
Speaker 0: we have the same information available to us.

591
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:06,690
Speaker 0: They just don't read it right so they lack.

592
00:37:06,972 --> 00:37:09,751
Speaker 0: It's not about making a decision based upon information It's.

593
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,057
Speaker 0: they don't even have the.

594
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:13,167
Speaker 1: you know the the but they have made a decision.

595
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:13,971
Speaker 1: in that case They've.

596
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:16,641
Speaker 1: the decision they've made is that information has been presented to them.

597
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:30,628
Speaker 1: that is pretty verifiable and objective Or at least it is information that everyone else who is solving the problem or everyone else who was in the same situation Also receives and they choose to ignore this extent information thereby belying their own intelligence.

598
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,250
Speaker 0: Whatever you're getting?

599
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,235
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, I'm getting.

600
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:36,781
Speaker 0: what about critical thinking ability?

601
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,556
Speaker 0: if they can if someone can figure something out Then you know.

602
00:37:40,576 --> 00:37:43,890
Speaker 0: if they have figuring out abilities, then they are probably smart.

603
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:54,749
Speaker 0: But I just as an aside I do feel that in there's nothing to do with like the amount of knowledge You know you have in your brain, or you know what particular area that knowledge might may or may not be in.

604
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,602
Speaker 0: You know or anything like that.

605
00:37:56,682 --> 00:38:02,547
Speaker 0: It's your your ability You know your potential to figure things out when you know they are in front of you.

606
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:06,550
Speaker 1: yep So what is one habit you wish to break from Kate monster?

607
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,097
Speaker 1: Uh-huh I stopped looking at the internet all the time.

608
00:38:09,138 --> 00:38:09,901
Speaker 1: that was my only one.

609
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:17,067
Speaker 0: really I also don't look at the internet all the time a Habit, I don't have that many habits.

610
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:23,687
Speaker 1: I mean I've tried to have more habits like wearing blazers every day instead of almost every day a

611
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:38,568
Speaker 0: habit I would like to When I do my laundry I don't put the clothes away soon enough and then When I it's like when right out if I do put the clothes away, and the floor is clean I'll start putting all the clothes in the basket, but then I'll put them on the floor.

612
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:43,181
Speaker 0: And you know right now basically my room is just it always.

613
00:38:43,402 --> 00:38:47,478
Speaker 0: it happens every time and every time I try not to do it And I end up doing it anyway like right now.

614
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,030
Speaker 0: My room is basically clothes all over the floor.

615
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:50,760
Speaker 0: I don't know what's dirty.

616
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:51,449
Speaker 0: I don't know what's clean.

617
00:38:52,311 --> 00:39:12,576
Speaker 1: Actually the one thing I'll do is whenever I'm like dealing with a bunch of papers to file or something I've got like like a now and I was building all the cables into this desk I will often find a problem that could be solved right now But will require a lot of annoying and tedious work, or it can be solved 80% of the way Shittily in like two seconds.

618
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:20,879
Speaker 1: I will always go with the 82 sec at the 80% two-second solution Always and I'll always say to myself someday.

619
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,967
Speaker 1: I'll go with the long and tedious solution, and it never happens.

620
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:30,188
Speaker 1: hmm right now I basically have a Nest of cables behind this desk.

621
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:34,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got it to redo some wires behind my TV a little bit.

622
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:43,968
Speaker 1: I'm gonna fix that once everything is situated wire channels wire channels and wire bag and getting a speedway I'm gonna put the two speakers behind and get the whole thing going on all right.

623
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,798
Speaker 0: What is the most offensive thing?

624
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:47,521
Speaker 1: you don't wake up.

625
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:49,710
Speaker 0: I didn't see two girls one cup.

626
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:53,401
Speaker 0: But I guess tub girl is the most offensive thing I've seen.

627
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:56,855
Speaker 0: but it's like it's not offensive and that like oh I am offended.

628
00:39:56,915 --> 00:40:00,149
Speaker 0: It's offensive as like it offends my senses like it makes me nauseous.

629
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:03,868
Speaker 1: Well, we really you know what is the most offensive thing you've ever seen in any media.

630
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:09,850
Speaker 0: that was from You know by the way that was in the you know tub girls in the medium of photography, right?

631
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:12,589
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it's that you have to separate between.

632
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:17,890
Speaker 1: I mean There's like tub girl goat see offensive, and then there's like guy murdering babies offensive.

633
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:19,398
Speaker 0: I never said I've never seen.

634
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:20,544
Speaker 0: it says what have you ever seen?

635
00:40:20,564 --> 00:40:21,087
Speaker 0: I've never seen.

636
00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:21,690
Speaker 0: I'm sure it exists.

637
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,252
Speaker 0: I've never seen it.

638
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:23,418
Speaker 1: I've seen things like that.

639
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,708
Speaker 0: answer the question which I've seen have you ever seen?

640
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:31,030
Speaker 1: I well I I still bry have two completely separate scales in my head for offensive.

641
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:38,090
Speaker 1: There's actually offensive on the grounds that someone is doing great harm and offensive on the grounds that that is totally disgusting.

642
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:54,710
Speaker 1: Yeah Totally disgusting is two girls one cup which you know, I'd seen all the gross stuff on the internet forever Yeah, I'd seen rotten calm even yeah, but I went into two girls one cup thinking Why is everyone making a big deal about this tub girl?

643
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,079
Speaker 1: What could be grosser than that without actually hurting someone?

644
00:40:58,861 --> 00:41:02,565
Speaker 1: and I I don't even I. to this day nothing has.

645
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:10,733
Speaker 1: Two girls one cup was an order of magnitude More vile than I could have possibly expected even knowing what it was a shampoo Wasn't there?

646
00:41:10,773 --> 00:41:14,830
Speaker 0: that other video that came out shortly after the people were saying was even worse that I didn't watch.

647
00:41:15,614 --> 00:41:17,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, that's pretty much it.

648
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:24,765
Speaker 1: I mean If you could take over a local high school, what would be the first policy change you would implement?

649
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:26,790
Speaker 1: and why from Kate monster?

650
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:27,911
Speaker 0: All right.

651
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:29,722
Speaker 0: I'm sure this is one of those things.

652
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:35,687
Speaker 1: we could do a whole show If possible, I'll get Bill Gates now say Bill Gates take over the school.

653
00:41:35,847 --> 00:41:37,312
Speaker 0: That's a good move I think.

654
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:40,342
Speaker 0: basically, you know regardless of any other policies.

655
00:41:40,683 --> 00:41:45,477
Speaker 0: The number one priorities would be to Make failing a possibility.

656
00:41:45,798 --> 00:41:58,785
Speaker 0: right, you know forget that, you know everyone left behind, you know If you suck you should fail and if you're awesome You should get an A. so we need to have you know, the grading needs to be on You know and school should be fucking hard really hard.

657
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:06,170
Speaker 0: and the philosophy Segregate the school based on you know, I'd put the smart kids into smart class and the dumb kids in a dumb class.

658
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,970
Speaker 1: I'll say this my high school did that my high school was heavily heavily segregated based on ability.

659
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:28,810
Speaker 1: they're even separate wings depending on how good at very, you know academics you were and What they did is the people who did very poorly were pushed more and more toward vocational things or they had interventions and everything and Like the really really smart kids had classes of like four people taking really advanced stuff.

660
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:32,410
Speaker 1: Like I took more math and science at in high school.

661
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:37,650
Speaker 1: Then RIT even offered outside of like the master's programs in those things.

662
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:42,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd have to like take if you wanted to learn more chemistry, you know You'd have to take be a chemistry major.

663
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:47,717
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the segregation like that I mean really my philosophy is that you need to.

664
00:42:48,118 --> 00:43:13,427
Speaker 1: you need to set the bar such that No one ever gets a perfect score in anything because if anyone in any class ever gets a perfect score on any assignment That means that there was not enough granularity There was no room for improvement and like all my AP classes the average score I got an AP bio was about 30 31 percent on a test Mm-hmm, and the goal was always try to get better.

665
00:43:13,568 --> 00:43:15,529
Speaker 1: and you know When I finally went we took the AP test.

666
00:43:16,032 --> 00:43:20,249
Speaker 1: Everyone in that class got a five because the AP test was laughable compared to what we were doing in class.

667
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:25,490
Speaker 0: Yep, the other thing is that I would make you know, I would sort of you know, it's a high school, right?

668
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,133
Speaker 0: So these are.

669
00:43:26,454 --> 00:43:33,620
Speaker 0: the thing is in high school that college is basically sort of like assumed to be like 13th-grade at this point in the United States, right?

670
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:36,228
Speaker 0: But really I think that's kind of BS.

671
00:43:36,669 --> 00:43:45,125
Speaker 0: and You know, you only really need to go to college if you know You want to be a doctor a lawyer something that needs a college, you know of.

672
00:43:45,225 --> 00:43:46,890
Speaker 0: you know many years of extra learning.

673
00:43:46,951 --> 00:43:52,302
Speaker 1: I would push the trade schools a lot more and at least It doesn't suck to be a plumber, right?

674
00:43:52,342 --> 00:44:00,186
Speaker 0: I would basically point out to everyone, you know There's all sorts of jobs possibilities out there in the world that no one ever tells you.

675
00:44:00,206 --> 00:44:01,750
Speaker 1: I would fire every guidance counselor.

676
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:02,750
Speaker 0: Oh for sure.

677
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:09,675
Speaker 1: No guidance counselor in my entire life ever told me that being a race car driver or a welder or any of that stuff was Even a possibility.

678
00:44:09,755 --> 00:44:14,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's all these jobs out in the world that no one even you know Like you I could have.

679
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:23,410
Speaker 0: you know, if someone would have told me in high school You could be like a sailor on you know Rich people's yachts or a juggler on a cruise ship or any print major.

680
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:28,830
Speaker 1: Remember our friend who went into the printing program at RIT and like had crazy money from his co-ops moved to Florida.

681
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know there's all sorts of jobs out in the world.

682
00:44:32,576 --> 00:44:44,643
Speaker 0: Right and the career centers at high schools are Terrible at you know Like teaching kids about all the creative possibilities of things that you can do with the rest of your life that are totally awesome.

683
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:51,290
Speaker 0: or just think that is a large reason That people are very dissatisfied with their jobs because everyone ends up in the office job.

684
00:44:52,033 --> 00:44:55,347
Speaker 0: You know sit in a desk all day and there are plenty of big money.

685
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:59,390
Speaker 0: or you know Good money jobs out there that are not sit at a desk all day.

686
00:44:59,872 --> 00:45:04,734
Speaker 0: And if I had known better when I was in high school, even though I'm a you know I'd like computers a whole lot.

687
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:07,583
Speaker 0: I might have been doing something else computer II.

688
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:10,072
Speaker 1: you would have at least tried to be a race car Drive.

689
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:10,795
Speaker 0: Oh, I could have.

690
00:45:11,057 --> 00:45:13,710
Speaker 0: I could have been doing computers for a race car.

691
00:45:14,773 --> 00:45:16,028
Speaker 1: Imagine being the IT guy.

692
00:45:16,274 --> 00:45:22,170
Speaker 0: Like At CES today, they made big announcements for like the computer like the Ford Sync stuff.

693
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,821
Speaker 0: That's in the for in all you know, the Ford vehicles you can get.

694
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:28,430
Speaker 0: I could have been making that instead of making You know websites, right?

695
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,300
Speaker 1: Come on, but the real key was segregation.

696
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:39,663
Speaker 1: if you're gonna segregate students based on ability You've really got to set it up to where you Challenge the kids who do well and you give help to the kids who don't do well.

697
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:41,450
Speaker 1: like failing should be it sucks.

698
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:42,115
Speaker 1: You failed.

699
00:45:42,437 --> 00:45:49,697
Speaker 1: we got to figure out either what to do Let you pass on your own without just giving everyone a B or Alright, you can't pass.

700
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:51,586
Speaker 1: Let's figure out what kind of jobs you can do.

701
00:45:51,687 --> 00:45:54,590
Speaker 0: gas station Yeah, and if that's the best, you know That's.

702
00:45:54,610 --> 00:46:01,570
Speaker 0: the other thing is that success is doing the best of your ability and it's just the reality that people have different abilities.

703
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:02,949
Speaker 0: That's just the way the world is.

704
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:10,030
Speaker 0: So if the best that you can do is gas station and you get to gas station like, you know attendant hells.

705
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,081
Speaker 0: Yes, awesome for you.

706
00:46:11,122 --> 00:46:11,790
Speaker 0: That is succeeding.

707
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,096
Speaker 0: So what I would not be like?

708
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:21,510
Speaker 0: look down upon now if you could do a lot better than gas station But you work in one because you're a sad lazy sack who's all drugged up and drinking 40s or whatever.

709
00:46:21,952 --> 00:46:26,309
Speaker 0: Then that should be looked down upon, you know, and that's that's what we need to teach people.

710
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:36,194
Speaker 1: Specifically, I think I don't you know, we can't get into all the details I think a good way to go about the segregation because you know They're all the way no matter what you do Someone will fall through the cracks.

711
00:46:36,515 --> 00:46:41,430
Speaker 1: the reality of society is that it is impossible to do anything that doesn't have some edge.

712
00:46:41,771 --> 00:46:45,530
Speaker 1: Situation where someone's gonna fall through the cracks on some end of the spectrum, of course.

713
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:47,690
Speaker 1: So what you do is you do standardized testing.

714
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,063
Speaker 0: It's like if you try to arrest all the robbers you're gonna accidentally.

715
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:59,949
Speaker 0: you can either arrest all the robbers But you'll accidentally arrest some non robbers or you can guarantee that you won't arrest any non robbers But then some robbers are gonna go free.

716
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:04,750
Speaker 0: You can't perfectly get all the robbers and not get any of the non robbers and it cannot happen.

717
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:12,241
Speaker 1: so you need is no way standardized tests across all curriculum and Standardized requirements for each grade like 11th grade.

718
00:47:12,503 --> 00:47:17,809
Speaker 1: to pass it to graduate You need to meet all of these requirements and there's just a standardized test.

719
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:25,541
Speaker 1: However, if you fail that test you have one recourse Which is to go to an interview at the school instead.

720
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:28,070
Speaker 1: or maybe you know get experts that do these interviews.

721
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:50,890
Speaker 1: now It's like a magnet school and if you want to challenge the fact that you failed other than just taking the year again or retesting or whatever you have to go to the center and Intelligent smart people psychologists educators people who are trained Interview you and determine if either you are smart, but you screwed up the test you are smart But you have a problem that prevented you from doing the test or you aren't capable of that grade.

722
00:47:51,617 --> 00:47:55,149
Speaker 0: I think just in general though It's like we you know schools in the u.s.

723
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:59,970
Speaker 0: You know sort of been following this formula and this curriculum and there hasn't been a lot of differentiation.

724
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:07,370
Speaker 0: Well grades are determined by age not by ability But it's like I can come up with a lot of different systems that I think would be better than what we have now.

725
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,157
Speaker 0: But really all we need to do is experiment.

726
00:48:09,197 --> 00:48:12,310
Speaker 0: just try different shit all the time and see what works.

727
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:17,810
Speaker 0: You know and you might say oh you experimented on my kid and now he's stupid because you put him in a experimental thing.

728
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:18,934
Speaker 0: That was you know bad.

729
00:48:19,014 --> 00:48:19,536
Speaker 0: Well, it's like.

730
00:48:19,556 --> 00:48:23,430
Speaker 0: well, you know, it's the greater good, you know because your kid screwed up.

731
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:29,110
Speaker 0: We know not to ever try that method of education again, and we're trying some other things other people and you know.

732
00:48:30,332 --> 00:48:38,030
Speaker 1: But I guess my point was just if you're gonna do any sort of segregation a smart way to go about it is two-factor two-factor authentication two-factor segregation.

733
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:42,050
Speaker 1: There's the broad brush broad brush factor the standardized test.

734
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:46,450
Speaker 1: But then you have to have a more fine-grained instrument that you only use on the people who?

735
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,259
Speaker 1: Appear to have been caught by the edge conditions in the standardized.

736
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,285
Speaker 0: that can help alleviate some of that.

737
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:56,018
Speaker 1: and there's and maybe even a third Factor, you know, but you can't do that forever.

738
00:48:56,078 --> 00:48:57,464
Speaker 1: Someone's always gonna fall through the cracks.

739
00:48:57,484 --> 00:48:58,026
Speaker 1: That's just life.

740
00:48:58,709 --> 00:49:00,834
Speaker 0: All right On the show.

741
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:04,730
Speaker 0: one of you mentioned that there are things worth fighting for in the context of an army.

742
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,678
Speaker 0: What are some of those things that you believe should be fought for.

743
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:11,610
Speaker 0: I would join the army if it was like World War two.

744
00:49:12,511 --> 00:49:15,910
Speaker 1: Well per I would fighting against genocide fighting against war.

745
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:25,816
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean if it was if I you know That's my the only reason that I did not join any sort of military Establishment because like if I was in the Air Force or something I mean I have really good eyesight.

746
00:49:26,238 --> 00:49:28,650
Speaker 0: I would have been probably pretty good at like flying a plane.

747
00:49:29,995 --> 00:49:31,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, that the thing is.

748
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:36,589
Speaker 0: if I join the army They would have made me do a push-up and I would have I believed that if I had done it at the time though

749
00:49:36,771 --> 00:49:37,690
Speaker 1: There is this problem

750
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:41,857
Speaker 0: I would have been you know If I had done it then I'll be push upping that the

751
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:46,552
Speaker 1: military in the United States just because of the environment is very hostile To.

752
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:49,190
Speaker 1: basically what is the modern culture of tech people?

753
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:55,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I mean the other long-haired hippie dudes doing code are never gonna join the military no matter how strongly they believe in.

754
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,810
Speaker 0: Yes, the other thing is that in the military, right?

755
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:00,904
Speaker 0: There's always a risk of going back to my weakness.

756
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:02,109
Speaker 0: They tell you what to do.

757
00:50:03,273 --> 00:50:04,329
Speaker 0: That's pretty much how it works.

758
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:10,225
Speaker 0: Right if I could join the military but choose What I you know in which manner I would serve.

759
00:50:10,526 --> 00:50:14,650
Speaker 0: and there was you know There was no risk of me serving in a manner that I did not wish to serve.

760
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:19,269
Speaker 0: I would totally do it because I could just be like oh the genocide in Rwanda you want me to go help.

761
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:21,336
Speaker 0: Yes Oh, there's a war in Iraq.

762
00:50:21,376 --> 00:50:22,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just not going.

763
00:50:22,339 --> 00:50:24,225
Speaker 1: or Scott's super future cyber.

764
00:50:24,486 --> 00:50:26,830
Speaker 1: Would you be a member of section 9?

765
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:30,435
Speaker 0: Depends, you know and I would be If I was.

766
00:50:30,455 --> 00:50:36,935
Speaker 0: I would decide you know what I would do on a mission by mission basis based on my personal Feelings, you know.

767
00:50:37,257 --> 00:50:40,255
Speaker 0: and if I decided yes, I will do this I would do it to the best of my.

768
00:50:40,275 --> 00:50:41,721
Speaker 0: you know, of course that doesn't work.

769
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:43,690
Speaker 0: a military needs mindless drones.

770
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,801
Speaker 0: Who will follow orders to?

771
00:50:44,881 --> 00:50:45,750
Speaker 0: exactly with no?

772
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,112
Speaker 1: Back talk.

773
00:50:48,514 --> 00:50:53,190
Speaker 1: special forces needs people who will use initiative and ingenuity to solve problems at their own discretion.

774
00:50:53,412 --> 00:50:59,125
Speaker 0: Yes, see I'm willing to use Ingenuity to solve problems at my own discretion if I want to.

775
00:50:59,145 --> 00:51:05,761
Speaker 0: if I don't You know if I don't want to do what you want me to do You might say, you know, there's a bad guy in that building.

776
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:06,163
Speaker 0: go get him.

777
00:51:06,183 --> 00:51:08,015
Speaker 0: I like no I agree with that bad guy Fuck you.

778
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:11,810
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna leave him alone And then they're not gonna be very happy with me.

779
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,716
Speaker 0: But if there was a bad guy in the building, I would say absolutely Yes, and I would get that guy.

780
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:18,490
Speaker 0: so I would be the master I would get him so fast not the professional.

781
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:20,876
Speaker 1: No, one at one at one area.

782
00:51:21,056 --> 00:51:31,070
Speaker 1: one way to get me to like pretty much add my services and add my abilities to some Sort of large military force in some capacity and I hate to use an anime reference.

783
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:35,010
Speaker 1: But if the United Nations or somebody like it went Gundam double-o

784
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:36,199
Speaker 0: Mmm,

785
00:51:36,422 --> 00:51:57,270
Speaker 1: the whole you know the idea that peacekeeping forces where there's a multinational body that no matter what it was if ever there was a militarized armed conflict the peacekeepers basically Invaded and instilled martial law and were hostile toward any belligerence in the theater until and basically just Prevented any actual war from happening until the situation could be resolved.

786
00:51:57,451 --> 00:51:57,611
Speaker 1: Yeah,

787
00:51:57,691 --> 00:52:15,404
Speaker 0: I mean basically what it comes down to is if there is something that is blatant and obvious You know evil to combat like, you know, like right now, you know Basically, all the evils in the world are sort of ambiguous and depend on your point of view, you know And you know one person's done wrong one person's done right at least most of the.

788
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:19,718
Speaker 0: you know, terrorism type evils You know, but there are.

789
00:52:19,898 --> 00:52:23,327
Speaker 0: you know, if there was something that was just blatant and obvious like bad guys, right?

790
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:32,073
Speaker 0: Like, you know one country invades another country and just starts killing everyone and drops nukes and spreads poison gas or something It's like.

791
00:52:32,113 --> 00:52:33,942
Speaker 0: well, those are obviously bad guys.

792
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:35,469
Speaker 0: I will gladly go and shoot them.

793
00:52:36,172 --> 00:52:44,610
Speaker 1: You know, of course part of the problem is that we have the situation where the wars that have been like that like between Iraq And Iran we kind of made that happen.

794
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,098
Speaker 0: Yeah, just because we live in the u.s.

795
00:52:47,158 --> 00:52:50,950
Speaker 0: The whole the whole situation with anything involving military is completely different.

796
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,842
Speaker 0: We basically live at any other point in time in history.

797
00:52:53,902 --> 00:52:54,304
Speaker 0: in any other.

798
00:52:54,425 --> 00:52:57,837
Speaker 1: we basically live in the nation That is the evil team from the Mighty Ducks.

799
00:52:58,198 --> 00:52:58,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

800
00:52:59,141 --> 00:53:01,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a problem from zarlak.

801
00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:07,330
Speaker 1: Can religion and rituals still be meaningful and worthwhile even while embracing an atheist theology?

802
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:08,815
Speaker 1: There's no such thing as atheist theology.

803
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:13,630
Speaker 1: Anyway, do you have your own rituals either from established religion or do you or of your own creation?

804
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,889
Speaker 0: Well, I think the problem is is that ritual has many definitions, right?

805
00:53:16,909 --> 00:53:22,367
Speaker 1: I mean I have the ritual of wine, but the ritual of wine is practical.

806
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,903
Speaker 1: I pull the cork out I examine it to see if the right wine is rotten.

807
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:27,230
Speaker 1: I pour it in a little glass.

808
00:53:27,431 --> 00:53:28,840
Speaker 1: I look at it to see if it's rotten.

809
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:30,510
Speaker 1: I sniff it to see if it's poison.

810
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:32,216
Speaker 1: I take a sip to see if it's poison.

811
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:33,199
Speaker 1: It's practical.

812
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:34,484
Speaker 0: It's the same thing with not.

813
00:53:34,524 --> 00:53:42,130
Speaker 0: yes rituals are not necessarily A supernatural right like you could have a secret handshake with someone.

814
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,850
Speaker 0: It's just a ritual it but it's not it, you know.

815
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:50,270
Speaker 0: But it's not supernatural or magical or religious in any way and there's absolutely nothing wrong.

816
00:53:50,330 --> 00:54:02,127
Speaker 1: But that sort of ritual except for the fact that I I dislike being automatic in my life That's whatever anything is happening and I'm doing it automatically I always want to be aware of it so that I can stop it and at least do whatever I'm doing.

817
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:02,770
Speaker 0: consciously, you know.

818
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:09,847
Speaker 0: But there can be like intentional Traditional rituals like we can intentionally have a Festivus pole as a ritual.

819
00:54:09,887 --> 00:54:15,150
Speaker 0: that or a tradition Right has nothing to do with any religion or supernatural, you know mysticism or anything.

820
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:20,170
Speaker 1: Well, we have yell at the sky day that really only the front row crew and only a small portion of that celebrates.

821
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:24,309
Speaker 0: Yes, but you know, but he says can religion still be meaningful.

822
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:39,238
Speaker 1: Nope No Religion is not meaningful period because everything that religion has to offer anything that a theological You know non evidence-based belief has you can have the exact same ritual the exact same meaning the exact same everything Without the supernatural belief.

823
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:40,785
Speaker 1: Yes, that's it.

824
00:54:40,805 --> 00:54:41,870
Speaker 0: That's easy, right?

825
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:43,770
Speaker 0: What?

826
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:49,710
Speaker 0: okay, what methods do you use to deal with ignorant people when the situation calls for such action?

827
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:57,209
Speaker 1: There are only three ways to react to ignorant people and that they scale from left to right on the far left is The I guess they could go.

828
00:54:58,031 --> 00:55:00,062
Speaker 1: Complete avoidance, which is what most people do.

829
00:55:00,123 --> 00:55:13,024
Speaker 1: the polite avoidance, you know You're out at a cocktail party and one of your co-workers says blah blah blah blah my chiropractor and you smile and nod because you're totally lame and you're totally avoiding confrontation and Sacrificing all your ideals because you're a pussy.

830
00:55:13,406 --> 00:55:19,290
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm The next level of escalation is the the the the fake that you you pretend to agree.

831
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:30,330
Speaker 1: you are very nice very accommodating but you're only doing this in order to Work a long-term goal of tricking them or forcing them to change their beliefs like yeah chiropractor blah blah blah.

832
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:38,880
Speaker 0: Then usually usually the end result of doing this is that they might say yeah chiropractor might be BS But then they don't change their behaviors in any way whatsoever.

833
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:39,382
Speaker 0: Keep going.

834
00:55:39,623 --> 00:55:41,550
Speaker 1: The only other answer at this point is buzz-altering.

835
00:55:42,032 --> 00:55:52,888
Speaker 1: yes, and I honestly I used to be the kind of person who would like go out of my way to Manipulate people like this to try to set them right and it took a lot of effort and it worked.

836
00:55:52,928 --> 00:55:58,045
Speaker 1: occasionally And maybe I'm just tired like it takes too much effort to manipulate people to that degree.

837
00:55:58,066 --> 00:55:59,390
Speaker 1: I just buzz-altering.

838
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:01,984
Speaker 1: I just I can't deal with people like that anymore.

839
00:56:02,004 --> 00:56:03,010
Speaker 1: Yeah at all.

840
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:08,490
Speaker 0: Basically, I sort of realized, you know, James Randi has you know, he says that basically it's hopeless.

841
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,826
Speaker 0: You cannot once someone is you know, completely ignorant and stupid.

842
00:56:11,846 --> 00:56:12,630
Speaker 0: That's it.

843
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:14,769
Speaker 0: You're never going to you know, bring them back.

844
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,701
Speaker 0: They you know, like I said before what is smart people?

845
00:56:18,122 --> 00:56:20,190
Speaker 0: smart people as people have critical thinking abilities.

846
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:25,516
Speaker 0: Well, if someone's ignorant and they don't have critical thinking abilities There are no words that you can say.

847
00:56:25,536 --> 00:56:31,450
Speaker 1: the worst problem are there are people who are not ignorant who are very well informed And yet who lack critical thinking?

848
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:38,733
Speaker 1: Yes Those are the most dangerous people because they can very dangerous very bad and very evil things and if they can do it in a very Efficient manner.

849
00:56:38,894 --> 00:56:44,650
Speaker 0: Yes, but you know if somebody you know doesn't have critical thinking abilities You basically are in pot.

850
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,385
Speaker 0: It's impossible to change their mind by.

851
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:51,427
Speaker 0: there is no Combination of words in any language that you could say to them to change their mind.

852
00:56:51,487 --> 00:56:57,090
Speaker 1: Well pummel empathy I mean left fist and right fist can work to a degree, but that doesn't yeah, but that's not gonna change their mind.

853
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:04,010
Speaker 0: That's just going to you know, make them suffer the consequence truth the full life consequence consequences.

854
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:08,749
Speaker 0: But so, you know, it's basically like I just you know, it's like.

855
00:57:08,769 --> 00:57:16,890
Speaker 0: well I just basically label the person as remember this is one of those people who is completely still my god Nothing to do with them anymore.

856
00:57:17,332 --> 00:57:28,089
Speaker 1: You realize in our lifetime the Google goggles are gonna get to the point to where I in my glasses I can just have tags on people and I'll be able to see when other people have tagged people as a woo-woo.

857
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:29,854
Speaker 1: No, awesome.

858
00:57:29,874 --> 00:57:30,315
Speaker 1: Yeah.

859
00:57:31,478 --> 00:57:31,919
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

860
00:57:31,939 --> 00:57:33,523
Speaker 1: We'll have Google moderator for people.

861
00:57:33,544 --> 00:57:34,386
Speaker 1: That's so great.

862
00:57:34,486 --> 00:57:35,027
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

863
00:57:35,048 --> 00:57:35,850
Speaker 1: I want this now.

864
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:37,835
Speaker 1: Yes, especially if you.

865
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:40,388
Speaker 0: only then you can go down the street and say there's an awesome person.

866
00:57:40,408 --> 00:57:40,810
Speaker 0: Hey, what's up?

867
00:57:41,011 --> 00:57:42,858
Speaker 1: We had to do a whole show on augmented reality.

868
00:57:43,602 --> 00:57:46,052
Speaker 1: Oh my god, don't let us forget kids cuz you know I'll forget.

869
00:57:46,072 --> 00:57:46,975
Speaker 1: we already talked about that.

870
00:57:46,995 --> 00:57:51,070
Speaker 1: Right, but I just buzz aldrin people left and right and there's nothing.

871
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:58,670
Speaker 1: Have you ever gone back into the deepest depths of the geek nights archives and listen to episodes to see how your opinions on various?

872
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:05,990
Speaker 1: topics and issues Have changed ever since starting the show from Erin in Alberta, which doesn't suck but Calgary does.

873
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,704
Speaker 1: No I plan to.

874
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:11,916
Speaker 1: Actually, we have a whole plan.

875
00:58:12,378 --> 00:58:18,742
Speaker 1: a crab people episodes we can do is pick an old episode We did a long time ago both listen to it and then redo that.

876
00:58:19,023 --> 00:58:20,106
Speaker 0: Oh, that is double meta.

877
00:58:20,146 --> 00:58:21,210
Speaker 0: Let's not do this or better?

878
00:58:21,338 --> 00:58:30,840
Speaker 1: No Think about how interesting if we do the same show again without listening to that show and then just tell the listeners We did this show again See if our opinions have changed.

879
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:32,209
Speaker 1: We didn't listen to the previous one.

880
00:58:32,693 --> 00:58:38,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, I basically I've only The amount of geek nights episodes that I've listened to in full is a very small number.

881
00:58:38,645 --> 00:58:39,830
Speaker 0: for a very short period of time.

882
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:48,643
Speaker 0: I basically never listened because When I did listen for the short period of time Basically, all it did was make me remember everything that I already said and heard.

883
00:58:49,085 --> 00:58:50,650
Speaker 0: so there was really no point.

884
00:58:51,218 --> 00:58:53,376
Speaker 1: I don't listen at all even when I edit there's no reason to.

885
00:58:53,456 --> 00:59:04,950
Speaker 1: but I would like to take old episodes and revisit them without Listening and then maybe later I might listen to the two for my own edification like wow I really changed my opinion back there and I can't figure out when that opinion change.

886
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,541
Speaker 0: Yes, but the question was have you ever?

887
00:59:06,742 --> 00:59:07,447
Speaker 0: and the answer is no.

888
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:21,316
Speaker 1: Nope nope, however, I have listened to in recent memory at least one of the Those episodes Unlistenable good fucking God.

889
00:59:21,336 --> 00:59:22,900
Speaker 0: the next question.

890
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,310
Speaker 0: Do you have any friends who aren't geeks now?

891
00:59:27,451 --> 00:59:33,679
Speaker 1: Mmm because I would say that those people are acquaintances and there's levels of acquaintance But they have not crossed the line into friend.

892
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,809
Speaker 1: Never mind family like the crew has.

893
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:38,874
Speaker 0: yeah I mean I guess they're you know The closest are.

894
00:59:38,894 --> 00:59:48,142
Speaker 0: I think the people that I would count as friends who aren't geeks are people who are like friends of my family Right, so it's like, you know, my mom.

895
00:59:48,222 --> 00:59:50,390
Speaker 0: there's someone I call like aunt Debbie, right?

896
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:55,663
Speaker 0: But she's not actually my aunt by any My mom's best friend since my mom was in.

897
00:59:55,723 --> 00:59:57,130
Speaker 1: well, you know what that is cool, right?

898
00:59:57,330 --> 01:00:04,280
Speaker 0: There's so hurt that so hurt, you know Debbie's family, you know Her husband and her children are friends with my family.

899
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,148
Speaker 0: So they're my friends and they're not all nerds.

900
01:00:07,408 --> 01:00:08,050
Speaker 1: Here's how that works.

901
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,880
Speaker 1: You know is there are friends by choice.

902
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:22,470
Speaker 1: by definition friends are by choice unless you you know Can't deal with leaving high school and you join frats and things just to be forced into friendships as opposed to you know Friends on your own, but they're in with family.

903
01:00:22,771 --> 01:00:23,876
Speaker 1: There is family by choice.

904
01:00:23,937 --> 01:00:26,790
Speaker 1: front row crew is a self-selected sample of family by choice.

905
01:00:27,272 --> 01:00:29,038
Speaker 1: There is also family by birth.

906
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:40,346
Speaker 1: and while family by birth is a very strong bond as a result There are friends through family by birth Yes, but the thing is friends through family by birth are you know, if they're you know, they're not.

907
01:00:40,466 --> 01:00:42,294
Speaker 0: if they're not blood relatives Right.

908
01:00:42,335 --> 01:00:44,370
Speaker 0: These are people who are friends by choice.

909
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:46,260
Speaker 0: But basically what it is is our hope.

910
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:55,710
Speaker 0: my whole family by birth Chooses another whole family by birth as friends, you know It just so happens that it happens to be like a group of people and another group of people.

911
01:00:56,051 --> 01:01:01,710
Speaker 0: So imagine if like the front row crew saw another front row crew and decided that we should be friends with that front row crew.

912
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:10,870
Speaker 0: You know that back row crew, you know, we as a group decide so, you know The family that I was born into decided as a group that we would befriend this family in this family

913
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:14,770
Speaker 1: Periodically of a family convention and vote on whether or not you're still friends with these people.

914
01:01:15,091 --> 01:01:24,010
Speaker 0: No, but you know there there are other families that my you know Family that I grew up with was friends with and those people are my friends and not all of them are geeks.

915
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:32,880
Speaker 0: However, it's actually surprising how many of those people are at least partially geeky, you know There's model railroad people in these families.

916
01:01:33,221 --> 01:01:42,548
Speaker 0: There's a lot of sports geeks in these families Like cartoon watching geeks in these families People doing all sorts of Etsy kind of stuff in these families.

917
01:01:42,688 --> 01:01:48,090
Speaker 1: I do not Regularly associate in any way with anyone who was not a geek on purpose.

918
01:01:49,757 --> 01:01:52,910
Speaker 1: What was your favorite moment at a convention?

919
01:01:54,751 --> 01:02:04,196
Speaker 1: I might have to go all the way back to 2002 only because while I've had probably more fun Actual moments than this moment.

920
01:02:04,737 --> 01:02:08,628
Speaker 1: This is one of those moments that kind of solidified the legend of Krauser.

921
01:02:08,749 --> 01:02:11,117
Speaker 1: for me This is back when I went to.

922
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:14,410
Speaker 1: basically I think I've told the story on the show, but we have a lot of new listeners.

923
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:27,890
Speaker 1: No, I'll tell these shortened version dubbed this old webcomic friend of ours Scott Johnson did along with Luke Morgan and They were invited to stay in a room with a bunch of their like readers at Anime Central, which was in Chicago.

924
01:02:28,852 --> 01:02:29,838
Speaker 1: I happen to own a car.

925
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,268
Speaker 0: This is the moment you're gonna pick.

926
01:02:31,308 --> 01:02:32,112
Speaker 1: That's the moment I'm gonna pick.

927
01:02:32,352 --> 01:02:39,321
Speaker 1: so those two guys are like hey rim you want to go to Chicago and I was like For the whoring and the drinking.

928
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:40,147

929
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:52,290
Speaker 1: We had this, you know, there's this whole crazy adventure like all the things that happen on the car breaking down Yep, driving into Indiana and then up into Michigan and then paying with a bad check to get back on the road.

930
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:52,997
Speaker 1: Cuz we're out of money.

931
01:02:53,017 --> 01:02:58,603
Speaker 1: Oh my god, so We get there and this scary looking nerdy guy kind of comes down.

932
01:02:58,643 --> 01:03:00,610
Speaker 1: He's like, oh my god, it's rim Scott and Luke.

933

942
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:28,743
Speaker 1: and rim was single at the time I was single at the time and Luke and Scott Johnson.

943
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:29,470
Speaker 1: we all look at each other.

01:03:31,731 --> 01:03:33,962
Speaker 1: he's like the only guy staying in the room other than us.

946
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:40,349
Speaker 1: and we look at all these girls and One thing leads to another and we're like and we see there's a bar like a wet bar in the room.

947
01:03:40,972 --> 01:03:44,425
Speaker 1: So we look at each other and Luke says to what the girl who's like run in the room.

Speaker 1: every time we go to conventions This is like one of the first conventions I ever went to.

952
01:03:51,781 --> 01:03:53,690
Speaker 1: by the way, we run these parties.

953
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:56,199
Speaker 1: We have all the stuff in the car not alcoholic bar.

01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:20,187
Speaker 1: We found a grocery store and an epicness ensued.

963
01:04:20,207 --> 01:04:20,750
Speaker 1: I'll leave it at that.

964
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:24,803
Speaker 1: That was probably the greatest moment at a con ever just because it was my first.

965
01:04:25,124 --> 01:04:26,950
Speaker 1: it was the first moment in the Legend of Rims

966
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:41,530
Speaker 0: The greatest moment at a convention, you know, it's weird because like there are things that happen at conventions and it's like You know what scale of greatness I mean you have playing settlers with hooker midgets that you can't get a better story than that.

967
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:47,149
Speaker 1: No, you also have the first time you walk into the Otacon dealers room You just don't know what to do about right, you know, you've got that.

968
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:51,864
Speaker 0: You know like amazing concert be it Larkin Seattle or TMR or whoever you want, right?

969
01:04:52,185 --> 01:04:53,750
Speaker 0: or Jonathan Colton or something, right?

970
01:04:54,171 --> 01:04:57,662
Speaker 0: You know, what can what can you put above that greatest event at a convention?

971
01:04:57,902 --> 01:05:00,470
Speaker 1: you've got excite bike to at packs, right?

972
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:03,541
Speaker 0: you've got like excite bike verse being revealed right.

973
01:05:04,064 --> 01:05:12,769
Speaker 0: and then you've got stuff like you know just playing a really awesome game of Via poletti or something or play, you know.

974
01:05:13,712 --> 01:05:19,127
Speaker 0: You know playing inheritance with Luke Craig, you know discovering the burning wheel or something like that.

975
01:05:19,168 --> 01:05:20,010
Speaker 0: That was at a convention.

976
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:23,638
Speaker 1: We have so many crazy Convention like conventions.

977
01:05:23,698 --> 01:05:24,864
Speaker 0: not there is not.

978
01:05:24,884 --> 01:05:34,581
Speaker 0: I don't think there is one That stands out like above all the others like oh, they're just like, you know many many many many many many many.

979
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:47,690
Speaker 1: the thing I can say about that is just that we'll never get sick of conventions, especially now that we don't go to just anime conventions, but Conventions are like geek cities that just form Periodically and if we had a geek city then we wouldn't need convention.

980
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,370
Speaker 1: And New York City is the close.

981
01:05:50,434 --> 01:05:52,262
Speaker 0: Talk about this because I think that's a question coming.

982
01:05:52,322 --> 01:05:53,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, then we got to stop soon.

983
01:05:53,467 --> 01:05:54,593
Speaker 1: I don't forget to it All right.

984
01:05:54,613 --> 01:05:56,169
Speaker 0: Well, it's only three away anyway.

985
01:05:57,751 --> 01:06:01,548
Speaker 0: Will you ever have a roundtable discussion on anything with the FRC?

986
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:06,029
Speaker 0: Parentheses this is overdue in the age of Skype one.

987
01:06:06,591 --> 01:06:13,450
Speaker 1: Oh right after we have e-commerce one almost no one we know in the front row crew has decent microphones or anything at home.

988
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:19,166
Speaker 1: So they'll sound more ass than even Scott did over Skype for one and two.

989
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:20,510
Speaker 1: it's like herding cats.

990
01:06:21,076 --> 01:06:22,832
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also Editing.

991
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:24,637
Speaker 0: it is like hurting double cats

992
01:06:25,018 --> 01:06:26,081
Speaker 1: pretty much the way we're gonna see

993
01:06:26,101 --> 01:06:28,909
Speaker 0: people talking over each other interrupting and skipping in and

994
01:06:29,672 --> 01:06:41,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, the way we're gonna handle that is whenever we have multiple people on the show We're either going to Skype in people who we know have like radio show skills already Or we're going to have people physically in the studio with us.

995
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:46,795
Speaker 1: So unless people come to the studio and sit down on the futon They're not gonna be on the show.

996
01:06:46,815 --> 01:06:48,441
Speaker 0: and even then there is there's still.

997
01:06:48,461 --> 01:06:54,789
Speaker 0: there's a limit to the number of people who can be On the show at once and it isn't a very small limit like four or maybe five.

998
01:06:55,433 --> 01:06:57,242
Speaker 0: You know you once you get more people than that.

999
01:06:57,323 --> 01:06:58,610
Speaker 0: It just becomes a disaster.

1000
01:06:58,811 --> 01:07:01,307
Speaker 1: We basically have to train people up to.

1001
01:07:01,368 --> 01:07:03,063
Speaker 1: yeah You can do a talk like if you listen.

1002
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:10,592
Speaker 0: there are some Podcasts out there that have very large numbers of hosts like calm geek speak as like can have five or six hosts and then they'll Guests.

1003
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:16,818
Speaker 0: but the only reason it works is because they make like four shows a week and all the hosts are always on the podcast All the time.

1004
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:17,729
Speaker 0: so they're all good at it.

1005
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,112
Speaker 0: We had.

1006
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:21,310
Speaker 0: we can have ten rims and Scott's on the podcast you know.

1007
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:29,062
Speaker 0: But if it's a rim a Scott and then five people who aren't on podcasts all the time of course The way around that is to set it up.

1008
01:07:29,162 --> 01:07:30,390
Speaker 1: I mean I have the giant mixer here.

1009
01:07:30,711 --> 01:07:34,469
Speaker 1: I basically mute everyone and I unmute people as I want to let them speak.

1010
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:38,450
Speaker 0: yes But even then it takes a large amount of preparation and setting up.

1011
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:39,514
Speaker 0: You know it's not like.

1012
01:07:39,775 --> 01:07:39,956
Speaker 0: you know.

1013
01:07:39,976 --> 01:07:42,224
Speaker 0: they say oh, it's overdue in the age of Skype.

1014
01:07:42,265 --> 01:07:42,867
Speaker 0: Hahaha.

1015
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:43,570
Speaker 0: It's not that easy.

1016
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:50,723
Speaker 1: If you had the time and patience to enter a long-term period in which you would either learn or improve upon a skill What would it be?

1017
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:54,242
Speaker 0: Learn or improve upon a skill.

1018
01:07:54,282 --> 01:08:00,489
Speaker 1: I would become a musician again I would get my trumpet skills back and probably just become a professional trumpet player again.

1019
01:08:01,752 --> 01:08:03,257
Speaker 1: I mean that was you know.

1020
01:08:03,318 --> 01:08:04,643
Speaker 1: I don't know how many listeners remember this.

1021
01:08:05,024 --> 01:08:13,631
Speaker 1: I flipped a coin between Becoming a professional trumpet player or going to RIT and going into IT like I. just I didn't care is 50/50 I Would.

1022
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:20,029
Speaker 0: I don't know what skill I would pick but would definitely be a skill of making something that is physical, right?

1023
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:24,550
Speaker 0: It's like I make software's all the time, but it's like I really like making crafts.

1024
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:31,644
Speaker 0: It could be you know and that's a wide for it could be like anything from like making cars To making little electronic things to making.

1025
01:08:31,663 --> 01:08:33,714
Speaker 0: you know shirts To.

1026
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:34,599
Speaker 0: you know just making.

1027
01:08:34,618 --> 01:08:36,229
Speaker 0: some blacksmithing.

1028
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:40,323
Speaker 0: You know just something that is making stuff boat boat making.

1029
01:08:40,424 --> 01:08:42,270
Speaker 1: what are some white gold-wielding white?

1030
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:42,831
Speaker 0: You know it's not.

1031
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:43,593
Speaker 0: that's not making.

1032
01:08:44,335 --> 01:08:47,604
Speaker 0: it would be some skill and you know carpeting cabinet making.

1033
01:08:47,624 --> 01:09:02,209
Speaker 0: it'd be some sort of skill in constructing Something physical with my hands, and I would you know basically I would become the master of whatever It was like making desks or chairs or something you know and then You know I'd make a whole bunch of them.

1034
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:11,229
Speaker 1: That's the one thing I am going to do now with all this extra free time is I don't know I'm either going to pick my trumpet back up, or I'm going to practice my harmonica a lot more serious.

1035
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,990
Speaker 0: Hey, you're not in my apartment.

1036
01:09:13,751 --> 01:09:17,185
Speaker 1: Well, you don't want to hear old Susanna a thousand times in a row.

1037
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:18,832
Speaker 0: no Well, that's that is.

1038
01:09:18,874 --> 01:09:32,990
Speaker 0: another thing is that I do you know like I don't have that much interest in music But like I played the guitar when I was in fourth grade and fifth grade, but then when I went to middle school I had I wanted you know I joined the middle school band and guitar was not an option.

1039
01:09:33,511 --> 01:09:36,162
Speaker 0: so I chose clarinet and I could not do two instruments at once.

1040
01:09:36,203 --> 01:09:41,979
Speaker 0: so I you know put guitar down and Basically, I quit stupid band in ninth grade.

1041
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:48,037
Speaker 0: I basically played the clarinet for four years, and then I quit that and So basically since 10th grade.

1042
01:09:48,138 --> 01:09:54,743
Speaker 0: I regretted giving up the guitar in the first place But I have never picked it up again, and you know sort of.

1043
01:09:54,884 --> 01:09:59,269
Speaker 0: you know I didn't regret it that much But when playing guitar hero, I regretted it much more.

1044
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,465
Speaker 0: So it's like I don't know you know.

1045
01:10:02,505 --> 01:10:13,850
Speaker 0: and then I said oh I'll get the harmonica, and if I have the you know the the wherewithal to actually practice this then Spending money on a guitar won't be a waste, but I didn't practice the harmonica, so I didn't buy a guitar.

1046
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,796
Speaker 0: But maybe I don't know.

1047
01:10:16,137 --> 01:10:16,298
Speaker 1: yep.

1048
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:17,201
Speaker 1: I got some free time.

1049
01:10:17,702 --> 01:10:17,883
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1050
01:10:18,204 --> 01:10:18,545
Speaker 1: Oh well.

1051
01:10:18,565 --> 01:10:19,950
Speaker 1: You're right that question was coming right up.

1052
01:10:20,231 --> 01:10:23,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, do you foresee outgrowing conventions?

1053
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:24,590
Speaker 0: had we?

1054
01:10:25,172 --> 01:10:31,879
Speaker 1: Continued with our old convention policy, which was go to every freaking anime convention I would have probably just given up on convention.

1055
01:10:31,919 --> 01:10:38,139
Speaker 0: I think the thing is is I already have outgrown Attending non gaming conventions.

1056
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:41,710
Speaker 0: You know I mean comic conventions are just places to shop.

1057
01:10:42,194 --> 01:10:43,344
Speaker 0: It's a big comic book store.

1058
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:43,990
Speaker 0: That's temporary.

1059
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:46,367
Speaker 0: I have no interest in that because I buy online at a discount.

1060
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:48,876
Speaker 0: well the Well the mocha is different.

1061
01:10:49,197 --> 01:10:50,502
Speaker 0: the anime conventions.

1062
01:10:50,522 --> 01:10:56,543
Speaker 1: I have outgrown going to them entirely right I would argue we haven't imagine if we didn't go to any cons at all.

1063
01:10:56,563 --> 01:10:58,270
Speaker 1: all right Otacon once a year.

1064
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:59,475
Speaker 1: We could have a lot of fun at.

1065
01:10:59,515 --> 01:11:02,145
Speaker 0: I think yeah, but it's not that much fun.

1066
01:11:02,185 --> 01:11:03,470
Speaker 0: I just go to anime, Boston.

1067
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:06,890
Speaker 1: It's closer, but hey anime convention right anime, Boston.

1068
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:07,332
Speaker 1: You're right.

1069
01:11:07,653 --> 01:11:08,738
Speaker 0: even so it's like you know.

1070
01:11:08,778 --> 01:11:11,837
Speaker 0: I you know and most of the only reason I would go is this people I know there.

1071
01:11:11,877 --> 01:11:13,172
Speaker 0: if I didn't know anyone there I wouldn't go.

1072
01:11:13,192 --> 01:11:17,810
Speaker 1: I probably would I used to go to conventions like just me and Scott Johnson all the time back in the day.

1073
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:20,223
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the girls were much closer to your age at that point.

1074
01:11:20,746 --> 01:11:24,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's funny How the girls got younger as I got older.

1075
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,570
Speaker 1: it's not like they stayed the same age, and I got older.

1076
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:27,956
Speaker 1: It's that we diverged.

1077
01:11:28,218 --> 01:11:30,790
Speaker 0: yep, but they don't say we're 20. you were 20, but now you're.

1078
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:41,237
Speaker 1: It's possible to outgrow anime cons just because the demographics were so squirrely, but all other conventions look at sci-fi cons or Gaming con.

1079
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:43,694
Speaker 0: I have no interest in a sci-fi con but a gaming con.

1080
01:11:43,714 --> 01:11:51,374
Speaker 0: I can never outgrow as long as I like games because the gaming con is just a place to go and Play games with people you don't know and games You've never played before.

1081
01:11:51,495 --> 01:11:58,144
Speaker 0: and as long as I'm a game fan that will always be good and you cannot get old unless gaming itself also get any calm.

1082
01:11:58,184 --> 01:12:03,683
Speaker 1: that either involves doing or That involves geeks who are my age intellectually.

1083
01:12:03,784 --> 01:12:09,623
Speaker 1: I mean imagine if Otakon were 26,000 20 to 30 something year old techie punk kids.

1084
01:12:10,024 --> 01:12:12,070
Speaker 1: yep that Otakon would be the best thing ever.

1085
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:16,090
Speaker 1: That's why pegs pretty good is the best thing ever because it's that and it's a gaming con.

1086
01:12:16,251 --> 01:12:20,030
Speaker 0: And there are other sorts of conventions like you know I guess like New York International Auto Show.

1087
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,730
Speaker 0: You know it's like it's cool to go and look at shiny cars.

1088
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:25,139
Speaker 0: But you know do I really need to go?

1089
01:12:25,159 --> 01:12:28,010
Speaker 0: not really the CES is going on right now.

1090
01:12:28,171 --> 01:12:28,899
Speaker 0: I'd like to go to that.

1091
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,490
Speaker 0: maybe once in my life I was so cool to see all new gadgets.

1092
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:38,250
Speaker 0: But it's just a room full of fancy new gadgets, but look at the question you reading gadget comm you do you foresee outgrowing?

1093
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:39,132
Speaker 1: conventions?

1094
01:12:39,212 --> 01:12:46,949
Speaker 1: and the answer is never because at its core all a convention is is Geography unless you live in a major city.

1095
01:12:47,412 --> 01:12:49,910
Speaker 1: Geography limits your social life in a big way.

1096
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:54,403
Speaker 1: I mean you can do stuff online But you go to conventions because it's a self-selected sample.

1097
01:12:54,423 --> 01:12:59,199
Speaker 1: the people who live in a particular area Live there for all these concerns that might not be related to.

1098
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:03,110
Speaker 1: you know shared interest jobs economy all that stuff family.

1099
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:13,530
Speaker 1: But a convention is a self-selected sample of people who say I am into X I'm going to go stay with all the other people or into X and have a tiny geeky city for a weekend.

1100
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:22,099
Speaker 1: Yep by definition all conventions are geeky because there's people who have a deep interest in something or People are being paid to go there by the company.

1101
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,550
Speaker 1: Yep hanging out all right.

1102
01:13:24,671 --> 01:13:30,361
Speaker 1: I think we should just do one more because this is a good question to end it on all right if you had to give One piece of advice to punk kids.

1103
01:13:30,803 --> 01:13:31,769
Speaker 0: What would you tell them?

1104
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:41,991
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say punk kids are 14 to 19 year old kids who are otherwise a lot like we were when we were 14 to 19.

1105
01:13:41,991 --> 01:13:47,130
Speaker 1: My biggest piece of advice to you is that almost nothing you were doing right now matters for the rest of your life.

1106
01:13:47,212 --> 01:13:47,744
Speaker 0: I was the same.

1107
01:13:47,785 --> 01:14:00,593
Speaker 0: advice I was gonna give is that right now there are people telling you all sorts of lies like your your grades in high school or whatever school you're in or the Most important thing in the world if you get an F in like math or you get suspended once your life is gonna be ruined Forever.

1108
01:14:00,633 --> 01:14:03,150
Speaker 1: you're not gonna get to go right, but that's all the old hat advice.

1109
01:14:03,752 --> 01:14:04,414
Speaker 1: Right.

1110
01:14:04,474 --> 01:14:10,885
Speaker 0: and the thing and the thing is right is that in if you want to be a doctor or a lawyer and you want A big fancy one at that.

1111
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:16,530
Speaker 0: Yes You probably do need to get all A's and go to Harvard or something to be the big fancy doctor lawyer.

1112
01:14:17,212 --> 01:14:23,270
Speaker 0: But doing poorly in school, you know is not going to ruin the rest of your life.

1113
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:24,134
Speaker 0: You are going to.

1114
01:14:24,195 --> 01:14:27,090
Speaker 0: you know, your school is like this huge huge thing.

1115
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:37,530
Speaker 0: It just dominates your life at least in the United States, you know for in the Western world I guess as a whole, you know for like 18 years of your life and maybe even through college and then it's gone.

1116
01:14:37,631 --> 01:14:38,940
Speaker 0: You never had to think about it again.

1117
01:14:39,001 --> 01:14:40,270
Speaker 0: It's just this it's just gone.

1118
01:14:40,631 --> 01:14:52,250
Speaker 0: So as long as you gain the skills to live life It doesn't actually matter the well in school unless the results in school themselves are necessary towards your goal of being a lawyer.

1119
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:53,174
Speaker 1: Now what I would say?

1120
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:54,500
Speaker 1: that that's that's the rub.

1121
01:14:54,882 --> 01:14:59,659
Speaker 1: the real measure of school is Knowing when things matter and when things don't.

1122
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:02,430
