1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,260
Speaker 1: It's Monday, May 11th, 2020.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,681
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,530
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:21,587
Speaker 1: We are in fact in our late 30s, and you can tell because we are talking about kitchen appliances.

5
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:24,467
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:27,888
Speaker 1: You know when I was a kid like I just didn't like.

7
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:36,108
Speaker 1: Appliances were just in the house Like they were just there like the fridge just existed by the will of the gods And I never thought about it.

8
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:41,690
Speaker 1: And I remember always wondering why all the adults around me always had all these opinions about the fridge.

9
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:53,606
Speaker 1: whenever we visited like some other kids family's house all the adults would be standing in the kitchen and they'd have the same conversation like Oh kind of fridge that oh, it's a fridge dare extra Express with an ice maker.

10
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:54,910
Speaker 1: Oh, I wish I had nice maker.

11
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:57,588
Speaker 1: I just remember thinking that was the stupidest thing ever here.

12
00:00:57,648 --> 00:00:59,826
Speaker 0: I am Okay, sure.

13
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:03,582
Speaker 1: So Has anything happened to you?

14
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:09,057
Speaker 0: we do anything Inside not going anywhere.

15
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:10,141
Speaker 1: I did go outside.

16
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,265
Speaker 1: Sunday was warm.

17
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:12,389
Speaker 1: I actually went out for a long run.

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,019
Speaker 0: So I've been having You know for many months now, right?

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,222
Speaker 0: It's like I've been having like, you know Not obviously not symptoms of.

20
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:32,682
Speaker 0: you know the virus like phlegm in the morning and you know some Like I'll sneeze a bunch when I'm cleaning a dusty area under the bed.

21
00:01:32,803 --> 00:01:35,370
Speaker 1: that just sounds like allergies, right exactly.

22
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:38,350
Speaker 0: But I've never had allergies my whole life except develop them at any time.

23
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:39,969
Speaker 0: I know that's what they said.

24
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,060
Speaker 0: so I still don't know if I have allergies or not.

25
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:54,155
Speaker 0: it is right and I clearly don't have like Like this, you know because I don't have any frame of reference other than like the stereotypical allergy Symptom that you see.

26
00:01:54,195 --> 00:02:01,350
Speaker 1: we're like people read eyes like watery eyes runny nose sneezing You right people only get that with like seasonal pollen type allergies, right?

27
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,064
Speaker 0: So I don't have that animal allergies because I'm not suffering extensively.

28
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,068
Speaker 0: You sound like allergies.

29
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:09,589
Speaker 1: This sounds like dust mites or mold or something like that.

30
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:10,416
Speaker 0: I don't know.

31
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,850
Speaker 0: but like, you know, I was thinking huh?

32
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,856
Speaker 0: Maybe I have allergy.

33
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:19,582
Speaker 0: and the last time I was at the doctor some months ago I was like, hey Is it safe to take allergy medicine if I don't have allergy?

34
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:22,472
Speaker 0: because I'm not gonna waste my time going to an allergy doctor Right now?

35
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:25,763
Speaker 1: my answer to that is definitely yes antihistamines.

36
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,690
Speaker 1: Don't do much else to your body.

37
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:30,692
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I took What is it?

38
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:38,518
Speaker 0: I basically went to the drugstore and I bought ten pills of the store brand of Loratadine, Claritin, Zyrtec.

39
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:39,785
Speaker 1: Oh Zyrtec.

40
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:43,887
Speaker 0: I don't like Zyrtec Cetirizine, yeah, I don't know.

41
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:49,406
Speaker 0: Anyway, it totally and actually I can't prove that it did something right.

42
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:53,749
Speaker 0: I need to more data But I think it did something.

43
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:56,300
Speaker 1: Probably just have allergies.

44
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:58,950
Speaker 0: Maybe I have some kind of allergy to something.

45
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,193
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to figure out what Zyrtec is because I don't think it's Loratadine But I forget.

46
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,730
Speaker 0: if it's no it's it's Cetirizine or something.

47
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,450
Speaker 1: But I don't remember if that is just a metabolite in the same like pathway as Loratadine or not.

48
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:15,557
Speaker 0: It seemed like the Loratadine Was had more.

49
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:20,653
Speaker 0: it was more side effect II especially like with more drowsiness and more liver Pretty sure.

50
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:28,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure Zyrtec is newer and the Cetirizine Seemed less side effect II, you know.

51
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you're come a long way.

52
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,529
Speaker 0: if you got allergy you shouldn't drink alcohol, but I don't do that.

53
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:39,498
Speaker 1: I mean if you got allergies like that when I was a kid You'd have to take like a Rhinocin or something.

54
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:40,542
Speaker 1: that shit had way more.

55
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:42,068
Speaker 0: what happened to your nose thingy?

56
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:43,518
Speaker 1: That is not.

57
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:44,587
Speaker 0: that is a diesel crumb.

58
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:52,100
Speaker 1: Nasal crumb is a chromelain sodium that is a different Non-systemic kind of any histamine in quotes.

59
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:54,205
Speaker 1: It does not have any body effects.

60
00:03:54,787 --> 00:04:04,641
Speaker 1: All it does is Actually prevent the cells in your nose that would react from reacting like it off at the source because it's a pain in the ass.

61
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:14,148
Speaker 1: you I still use it only in the spring because To make for it to be effective You have to put it up your nose like three or four times a day every day and not stop and it smells and tastes like shit.

62
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:15,807
Speaker 0: I've heard that.

63
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:20,870
Speaker 1: But it's super effective and it has zero side effects because it doesn't do anything in your body.

64
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,774
Speaker 1: It's not systemic like.

65
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:24,088
Speaker 1: it only stabilizes those mast cells up in your nose.

66
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:31,075
Speaker 0: Once long ago, I had a the doctor prescribed What's it called flonase or whatever?

67
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:33,101
Speaker 1: Oh, no, you don't want it.

68
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,204
Speaker 1: That's like Afrin, right?

69
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:35,327
Speaker 0: I don't know.

70
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:35,708
Speaker 0: Hold on.

71
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:39,343
Speaker 0: It's like the Yeah flonase.

72
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:47,681
Speaker 0: it's like You know you spray it up the nose, yeah, I don't know what's in flonase Anyway, so I had to add when it was.

73
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:49,670
Speaker 0: but now it's like not prescription anymore.

74
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,569
Speaker 0: I don't know if the not prescription one that they sell is.

75
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:55,620
Speaker 0: I'm sure it comes in since they're all different varieties.

76
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,725
Speaker 0: now that it's over-the-counter.

77
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:57,890
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you don't want it.

78
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,875
Speaker 1: That's a steroid one.

79
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:00,020
Speaker 1: You don't want to fuck with flonase.

80
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:12,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't know if the If the over-the-counter one is as strong as the Prescription one was or if they just said okay everyone can have this now, whatever or so jet the general rule.

81
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,590
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna name specific drugs, but there are no sprays that will basically stop congestion.

82
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:27,230
Speaker 1: But those have this rebound thing where if you use them You'll have to use more and more of them and get dependent on them to prevent like stuff from coming out of your nose.

83
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:32,648
Speaker 1: And if you stop using them, you'll have a rebound and your nose will run like crazy for weeks.

84
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:33,290
Speaker 1: Maybe longer.

85
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:35,378
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like using.

86
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,563
Speaker 1: but that's like after an

87
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:38,130
Speaker 0: aluminum deodorant, yeah

88
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,772
Speaker 1: Presprint

89
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:52,783
Speaker 0: where it's like yeah clog up your your armpits with a bunch of aluminum shards and then you know If you it'll prevent you from sweating in the armpit, but if you ever stop using it Well, now your pores are all opened up because they've been cut with aluminum shards.

90
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,369
Speaker 1: It's not quite that it's.

91
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:55,857
Speaker 1: it Doesn't cut them.

92
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,709
Speaker 1: It's not aluminum shards like you're thinking of.

93
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,867
Speaker 1: There's actually evidence of rebound perspiration, that's just anecdotal.

94
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:06,242
Speaker 1: granted I experienced that when I stopped using antiperspirant, but I don't think there's.

95
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:17,278
Speaker 0: I have not experienced it because I didn't use any first print but I see that in a lot of people where it's like, you know, it's sort of like you can't tell because the people who you It's like oh those people who sweat a whole bunch.

96
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:18,804
Speaker 0: They're the ones who use antiperspirant.

97
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:20,170
Speaker 0: these people who don't sweat a whole bunch.

98
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,824
Speaker 0: They're not using it, but it's like.

99
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,341
Speaker 0: And then you tell someone stop using it.

100
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,990
Speaker 0: It's no good and they sweat all over the place.

101
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:26,553
Speaker 0: It's like.

102
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,644
Speaker 1: but do they ever stop sweating all over the place?

103
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:29,529
Speaker 1: Maybe they just sweat a lot.

104
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:38,719
Speaker 1: That's what I don't know because I don't think I've ever seen this study that actually definitively said that ceasing any perspirant use will cause rebound perspiration.

105
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:44,009
Speaker 0: I Guess not but the point is you should avoid the antiperspirant if you can.

106
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:47,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, but only deodorant only is the way to go.

107
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:59,285
Speaker 1: I would just say my question to you is why if there's no evidence of any particular harms Mmm You're going on a gut feeling about a chemical that you seem to think is a shard of metal?

108
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:04,118
Speaker 0: no because It's actually aluminum combined.

109
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,350
Speaker 0: it's like aluminum something I hate or whatever.

110
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the point is it does work by physically clogging your pores.

111
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:10,953
Speaker 0: It's not like.

112
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:13,990
Speaker 1: it's a kind of put it this way be like the zirtex and the radidines.

113
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,776
Speaker 1: Those are later generation antihistamines.

114
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:25,530
Speaker 0: They don't really have a lot of side effects compared to like Benadryl Benadryl I just oh yeah Benadryl is for like if you're having a severe thing right now like you're breaking out in hives or some shit.

115
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,661
Speaker 1: Yep, Benadryl also has a lot of random side effects.

116
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:29,805
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you use?

117
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:30,648
Speaker 0: Benadryl every day?

118
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:31,170
Speaker 0: That's crazy.

119
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:33,890
Speaker 1: I mean there used to not be a lot of options for allergies.

120
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:35,602
Speaker 1: There used to not be a lot of allergy drugs.

121
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:36,730
Speaker 1: antihistamines were invented.

122
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:41,312
Speaker 0: I'm sure whoever invented the zyrtec is making mad money, but you know It's like.

123
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,426
Speaker 0: I bought ten of them, and I've already used two right.

124
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:46,208
Speaker 0: so

125
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:53,698
Speaker 1: yeah I don't know about that one because with most like one pill a day ones you got to take them for a while to kind of Build up the effect, and then you got to just know

126
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:59,126
Speaker 0: this you this and if this is truly working It works almost immediately in the last 24 hours, and it's tiny

127
00:07:59,307 --> 00:07:59,689
Speaker 1: not bad.

128
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:02,376
Speaker 0: But the thing is it's like okay.

129
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:04,142
Speaker 0: How often am I gonna use this?

130
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:06,289
Speaker 0: once every few days once right?

131
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,971
Speaker 0: It's like.

132
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:08,599
Speaker 0: so go online to buy some.

133
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,710
Speaker 0: I don't want to buy the name-brand one because it costs a fortune.

134
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:14,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, but online you might get some dodgy like doctor.

135
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,314
Speaker 0: exactly Exactly right.

136
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:20,410
Speaker 0: so even the store brand one was overpriced compared to some of the online ones.

137
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,895
Speaker 0: But the online ones I couldn't get.

138
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:25,787
Speaker 0: a nice quantity like a nice quantity would be like fitty right.

139
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:26,870
Speaker 0: That's a good number.

140
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:28,709
Speaker 1: That's not even a month because you take it every day.

141
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:32,162
Speaker 0: I wouldn't take it every day, but you're supposed to or like a hundred.

142
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:36,922
Speaker 0: You know, but like they're selling like 500 I'm like no that's what I buy.

143
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:39,813
Speaker 1: cuz just take one every day just 500.

144
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:42,232
Speaker 0: I also don't think I'm gonna take it every day I'll just take it.

145
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:47,878
Speaker 0: if I haven't taken it in 24 hours, and it's really bothering me I will say how that goes.

146
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:49,310
Speaker 1: welcome to the wide world of it.

147
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,420
Speaker 1: You can always get yourself tested.

148
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,894
Speaker 1: all it requires is 60.

149
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:53,049
Speaker 0: now is not the time.

150
00:08:53,049 --> 00:09:01,641
Speaker 1: 60 to 80 jabs in your back with a needle and then based on the results of that 12 to 24 Bigger jabs on both of your forearms with bigger needles.

151
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,327
Speaker 0: Do they still do it that way?

152
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:03,387
Speaker 0: Oh?

153
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,515
Speaker 1: At last I saw.

154
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:08,130
Speaker 0: yes, they haven't invented a new better way of doing.

155
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:10,122
Speaker 1: I don't think there's a better way to do allergy testing.

156
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:11,290
Speaker 0: That's not good.

157
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,817
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll try to look it up while we do a news.

158
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:13,862
Speaker 1: so it is Monday.

159
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:14,666
Speaker 1: talking about tech.

160
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:15,470
Speaker 1: got some news.

161
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:17,016
Speaker 0: I do have some news.

162
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:18,222
Speaker 0: I got a couple newses right.

163
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:24,850
Speaker 0: so the first news is that Tomorrow is Windows Tuesday right the second Tuesday of the month of May.

164
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:34,130
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and the the windows update that comes out on the second Tuesday of every month Is actually a surprisingly big windows update?

165
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,599
Speaker 0: It's gonna do all sorts of stuff right.

166
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,308
Speaker 0: there's gonna be some Cortana bullshit for you to turn off.

167
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:45,920
Speaker 0: yeah They have a new cloud download option.

168
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:57,749
Speaker 0: so this is important for anyone who might need to Reinstall windows right rather than having rather than having to like download windows make a USB stick Right and all that bullshit.

169
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:07,424
Speaker 0: You're gonna be able to do this cloud download reinstall where it will download Windows and then reinstall it with one Breton press.

170
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:08,530
Speaker 0: so you're in a windows.

171
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:10,213
Speaker 0: It's already set up But you want to reset.

172
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,702
Speaker 0: you want to reset it back to nothing and I do.

173
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:16,254
Speaker 1: maybe I don't have that USB stick that I got From Microsoft a long time ago.

174
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:18,039
Speaker 0: right exactly you push one button.

175
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:21,850
Speaker 0: It'll download windows and then reset the whole thing.

176
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:31,046
Speaker 0: You know to nut to original, but it'll have all the updates because it's downloading a brand new windows So you won't have to go through like Windows update bullshit when it's done.

177
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:41,599
Speaker 1: or as much Because when I fix my old laptop I just did a clean windows install using that USB stick and the USB stick was mighty old and it had a lot of Windows updates to get.

178
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:49,083
Speaker 0: yep, they're also They're fixing Some bullshit regarding the search.

179
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:50,889
Speaker 0: you know the search in windows basically never works.

180
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:54,221
Speaker 1: It works 90% of the time for me.

181
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:55,545
Speaker 0: It's kind of mad.

182
00:10:55,565 --> 00:11:02,070
Speaker 1: It's only had issues, but well Not not the taskbar like type an application if you're talking like search in a folder the index sir.

183
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,814
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the index search has been garbage for as long as we have this exist exactly hopefully making it Know what.

184
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,250
Speaker 1: to imply that I endorse the way that fucking search works?

185
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:23,449
Speaker 0: No, no, no, but you can read all about the other changes, but the big change for Scott is WSL 2 is now in a stable Released version of Windows and not in it because you know you don't know this.

186
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:32,996
Speaker 0: If you really want to get like a newer ahead of the curve windows you can join like their beta program and get like You know newer windows versions.

187
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:37,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is that kind of thing is generally not useful to most people.

188
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:40,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you don't have to use the.

189
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:41,589
Speaker 0: you know the old ass.

190
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:45,480
Speaker 0: You know windows whatever that everyone else is using.

191
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:48,493
Speaker 0: What happened?

192
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:49,537
Speaker 1: you have in trouble.

193
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:52,929
Speaker 1: I know I still hear you.

194
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,081
Speaker 1: I don't know what you what problem you think you're having.

195
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:55,684
Speaker 0: you still hear me.

196
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:56,670
Speaker 0: Am I the same loudness?

197
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:57,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're the same loudness.

198
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:02,156
Speaker 0: Okay, the wave on the thing got way smaller All right.

199
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:04,738
Speaker 0: Well, yeah Something's up with the thing.

200
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:05,120
Speaker 0: I don't know.

201
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,529
Speaker 0: All right, I figure that out.

202
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,415
Speaker 1: Okay, why do you keep your knob?

203
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:13,260
Speaker 0: I'm not messing with the knob.

204
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:16,630
Speaker 1: you don't have windows like auto ducking set up or any stupid crap.

205
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,413
Speaker 1: That's in your audio.

206
00:12:17,474 --> 00:12:18,458
Speaker 0: Windows even have that.

207
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

208
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're using like an ASIO driver, right?

209
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,579
Speaker 1: Let me check what drive what device driver.

210
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:28,510
Speaker 1: you're not using MME to take this audio input into audition.

211
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,819
Speaker 0: Are you know we said it when we started right?

212
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't change it.

213
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:33,047
Speaker 1: Did you know?

214
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:36,521
Speaker 1: I haven't changed anything You sure because you keep changing your knobbly for some reason.

215
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,465
Speaker 0: I don't know.

216
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:38,108
Speaker 0: something's bumping it.

217
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:39,463
Speaker 1: Don't bump it.

218
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:42,453
Speaker 0: Anyway What is it saying?

219
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:47,770
Speaker 1: All right, I see this update about making your device passwordless because Windows has supported that for a long time.

220
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,199
Speaker 1: It looks like the difference here.

221
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,249
Speaker 1: They added some options around it.

222
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:54,313
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

223
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:58,268
Speaker 1: Yeah to make people sign in with a pin instead of a pet.

224
00:12:58,288 --> 00:12:58,669
Speaker 1: I don't know.

225
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,498
Speaker 0: All right, you can already sign in with a pin.

226
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:01,061
Speaker 0: That's not new.

227
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:02,950
Speaker 1: I'm trying to figure out what's actually new here.

228
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,920
Speaker 0: Hmm, whatever WSL 2 is the big change.

229
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,382
Speaker 0: Basically, it's way way way better than WSL 1 and the only part of it That's meh.

230
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:18,637
Speaker 0: is that because it's actually a virtual machine now and not like a fake kind of deal?

231
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:25,360
Speaker 0: you You have to like set up the networking for it doesn't just share the windows network.

232
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:31,064
Speaker 0: So you can't just like run a service and then like go to localhost Because it won't be there.

233
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:31,726
Speaker 1: Huh?

234
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:32,769
Speaker 1: One of the updates.

235
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:33,050
Speaker 1: Actually.

236
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:40,747
Speaker 1: I'm looking at they're adding built-in support for network cameras Mmm, IP cameras though.

237
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:41,128
Speaker 1: They are good.

238
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:45,100
Speaker 1: That's not actually telling me if it'll support like RTMP here like exactly what they're gonna use.

239
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:49,240
Speaker 0: Lava, you know, it's a big big Windows update for everybody.

240
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,727
Speaker 0: you should definitely get on top of it.

241
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:56,979
Speaker 1: for now Windows 10 only sports network cameras that are compliant with the ONVIF profile s. I don't even know what that is.

242
00:13:57,522 --> 00:14:01,160
Speaker 1: I suspect I can't just point RTMP at Windows and then watch it.

243
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:04,593
Speaker 1: I suspect this is going to be utterly useless to the vast majority of people.

244
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,548
Speaker 0: I Mean, it's useful to someone.

245
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:09,681
Speaker 0: I just don't think it'll be useful to You.

246
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:11,990
Speaker 0: know you for the purposes you have.

247
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:16,851
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm just curious what the use is Generally for that kind of thing.

248
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:18,341
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

249
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:24,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll have to read through that having to install shady ass software If you want to see what your IP camera is looking at right now.

250
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,591
Speaker 1: Yep, if your IP camera doesn't just speak a normal protocol like RTMP.

251
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:29,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

252
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:30,460
Speaker 1: All right interesting.

253
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:35,919
Speaker 1: so in some other news There is a general problem right now.

254
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:44,580
Speaker 1: Obviously with a pandemic like this is not news that there is just fake Nonsense and like fake bullshit and ever all over the place on the internet.

255
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:59,709
Speaker 1: so Twitter is Saying they're going to at least try to detect and flag any tweets that have Disputed or misleading information about the pandemic.

256
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:03,580
Speaker 0: Why not just immediately ban any account that makes such a tweet?

257
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:04,643
Speaker 1: Exactly.

258
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:09,139
Speaker 1: What I don't understand about all these technological solutions to this is that I mean I want.

259
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,920
Speaker 1: the one part I understand is that these tech companies are stupidly trying to avoid being editorial.

260
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:18,520
Speaker 1: So they seem to be extremely hesitant to ever just say This kind of content is bad.

261
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:26,260
Speaker 1: No Nazis like they really want to keep the Nazis on their platform and just minimize the most abhorrent behavior of the Nazis.

262
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:28,668
Speaker 1: Same thing with bots and stuff like this.

263
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:31,940
Speaker 1: They don't actually want all these accounts to go away.

264
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,319
Speaker 1: They don't want all that traffic to go away.

265
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:39,620
Speaker 1: They just want to put a veneer over it to be able to say they did something and they always take these ridiculous half measures.

266
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:48,234
Speaker 1: So supposedly what they're gonna do is detect a tweet that has disputed or misleading information about it and flag it in some way.

267
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:59,095
Speaker 1: I Don't know how we can do better until we take over the government make it reasonable and then just start breaking up these tech companies like nationalized Twitter.

268
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:09,440
Speaker 1: The tricky part is I'm also curious how they actually expect to detect this stuff because as far as I can tell like they look At Twitter in Germany Nazi shit just never shows up like ever.

269
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:16,779
Speaker 1: why can't they just use the Nazi filter on the coronavirus stuff and just apply that globally?

270
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:28,327
Speaker 1: because every other realm of technology Especially email but also other things we have this idea that if there's a lot of bad content out there We're willing to accept collateral damage.

271
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:32,320
Speaker 1: We're willing for real emails to get lost as long as we never see spam.

272
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:35,454
Speaker 1: Why can't every platform just be like that?

273
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:36,800
Speaker 1: I feel like it won't happen.

274
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:43,198
Speaker 0: I'm willing to have good tweets get lost and as long, you know, I'm willing to let good accounts just get banned.

275
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:43,880
Speaker 1: like that sucks.

276
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:44,518
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

277
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:52,374
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people today didn't grow up in the era where like you might just lose your email address because it happened To be routed through the wrong IP address one day.

278
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:53,380
Speaker 1: that just sucks.

279
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,942
Speaker 1: But you know what?

280
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:56,933
Speaker 1: That's a small price to pay to never say it's a lot.

281
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:57,435
Speaker 0: Also.

282
00:16:57,495 --> 00:17:05,839
Speaker 0: It's a lot easier to Have someone go around looking at accounts that were falsely banned to reinstate them.

283
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,922
Speaker 1: Yep To very trivially identify these bad accounts like The.

284
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:17,682
Speaker 1: the problem is clearly not that they can't detect them and don't know how if the problem is that they don't want to deal With it.

285
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:18,507
Speaker 1: case in point.

286
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:20,780
Speaker 1: There's that plug-in blah blah not blocked together.

287
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:28,440
Speaker 1: the other one the blockchain one where you can basically look at an account and Tell Twitter to auto block every single person who follows that account.

288
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:45,399
Speaker 1: so all you have to do if you see one shitty bot is click on that bot and tell Twitter to block every account that Follows that bot because anyone that follows that bot is either an idiot in which case you shouldn't be following them Anyway, or is also a bot or possibly a person who believes the bot?

289
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:48,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are a handful Follow back like any account.

290
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:50,814
Speaker 1: that does the thing where if you follow me, I'll follow you.

291
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,320
Speaker 1: those accounts should all be banned, too.

292
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,003
Speaker 1: So screw them.

293
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:55,256
Speaker 0: There are a handful of people who?

294
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:06,966
Speaker 0: You know are like good people But they have this belief that like yeah, I should follow some disgusting people just to see what the other Argument and my mind is.

295
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,334
Speaker 0: they want to keep themselves out of the bubble right.

296
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,481
Speaker 0: so the problem is you would end up blocking those People.

297
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:13,810
Speaker 1: I already blocked those people, and I don't even know.

298
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,480
Speaker 0: those people can often be quite good right yeah.

299
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,105
Speaker 1: But I feel like if someone's

300
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,392
Speaker 0: be wrong in that belief if someone's

301
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:28,740
Speaker 1: truly a researcher or something like have an account that you use To follow the bots just like you have the throwaway email you use to sign up for dodgy websites like

302
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:34,806
Speaker 0: Like for example, I know a lot of like high-quality Journalists who will follow.

303
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:39,360
Speaker 0: you know Fox News type journalists or quote journalists, right?

304
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have to see what those people are saying to comment on it and whatnot.

305
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,257
Speaker 1: yeah But I'm saying like the level the threshold you apply this to like as much as I would want to.

306
00:18:49,297 --> 00:19:01,822
Speaker 1: I don't add to that My massive block list like everyone following some random Fox News piece of shit, but if it's like an obvious troll bot No following it and there are so many obvious troll bots like right We're talking about.

307
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:08,775
Speaker 0: but the thing is is like I'm saying is like you know someone might be following a you know Someone who's a disgusting right-wing person.

308
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:11,796
Speaker 0: collateral damage right, but it's like now you're.

309
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:15,329
Speaker 0: But you're blocking someone who's like you know and it's not like.

310
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:22,920
Speaker 0: if we had what we were talking about before where Twitter would unban Right the legit person right yeah, this wouldn't be a problem.

311
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:27,092
Speaker 0: But if you're just blocking all followers then yeah, you're.

312
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:28,576
Speaker 0: you are gonna block that.

313
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:35,091
Speaker 0: you know super awesome journalist who is You know constantly retorting right-wing people.

314
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:37,660
Speaker 1: ah but that retorting probably doesn't actually do anything.

315
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:42,275
Speaker 0: And I'm just saying is that you know that person is gonna also say other awesome things.

316
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:45,900
Speaker 1: They're a good person right yeah But then they should be smart enough to have a separate Twitter.

317
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,053
Speaker 0: Maybe your friend will retweet an awesome tweet that they make and you won't see it.

318
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm willing to.

319
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:54,380
Speaker 1: I mean I just looked a minute ago in the spam filter at my gmail.

320
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:56,243
Speaker 1: We've.

321
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:58,757
Speaker 1: collateral damage is acceptable in this case good.

322
00:19:58,897 --> 00:19:59,340
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

323
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:16,920
Speaker 1: But I guess what bothers me is that I could right now with that plug-in And I don't know 20 minutes of poking around I could probably identify with a high degree of accuracy the majority of English speaking Twitter accounts that are posting misinformation about the pandemic.

324
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:18,949
Speaker 0: That's just too many.

325
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,605
Speaker 0: you'd be sitting there all day I don't know because you click on one.

326
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:22,870
Speaker 1: you do you these net.

327
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:32,090
Speaker 1: these shitty bot accounts almost always have a nexus And there's always like one account that follows all of them And that's usually how they do their tracking and everything.

328
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:35,443
Speaker 1: once you find one of those mega accounts That's the ticket.

329
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:37,227
Speaker 1: those accounts don't actually tweet anything.

330
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:42,200
Speaker 1: usually they just follow and are followed by all the different bots in their little shitty network.

331
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:44,500
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

332
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:46,666
Speaker 1: So we'll see what comes of this.

333
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:53,150
Speaker 1: I suspect Twitter's policy will have zero in fact too little too late And we need laws around this any other anyway.

334
00:20:53,712 --> 00:21:14,758
Speaker 0: Yeah way back in the day of geek nights We talked about how Apple was changing OS X So that if you installed an app that wasn't from the OS X app store that wasn't signed and approved by Apple That it would warn you and say hey Are you sure you want to install this app that Apple hasn't reviewed to go into the App Store and such right?

335
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,546
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Right.

336
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:27,995
Speaker 0: and we thought that they would make OS X a closed platform like iOS where every app on OS X had to be signed By Apple and you couldn't run open source software, and you couldn't.

337
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:29,039
Speaker 0: you know that'll be it.

338
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,884
Speaker 0: They didn't do that.

339
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:34,554
Speaker 0: they stuck so far for all these years with the.

340
00:21:34,955 --> 00:21:36,599
Speaker 0: you know only the warning message.

341
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:45,331
Speaker 0: Windows actually sort of has the warning message sometimes when you install stuff Stuff, but there's other handful of just exes that I install still.

342
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:48,178
Speaker 0: yeah, sometimes it warns you and sometimes it doesn't.

343
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,686
Speaker 0: it's interesting It's not OS X.

344
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,577
Speaker 1: I think always I mean I did when I installed Windows disable all that stuff anyway.

345
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:24,577
Speaker 0: Yeah but anyway Another thing that happened in OS X way back in the day Apple is they switched from power PC To Intel as their CPU and there was this whole time period where they were like you know power PC binaries Didn't work if you bought a new Mac with the new with an Intel CPU And they had some a little bit of crossover capability and they had universal Packages that would work on both that you had to produce right, but those days are so far behind us.

346
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:28,342
Speaker 0: now every OS X Machine is just running Intel.

347
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,000
Speaker 1: yeah like that the writing was on the wall as soon as they started that migration.

348
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:44,724
Speaker 1: While a lot of people seem to weirdly like and erroneously believe that power PC would be supported indefinitely like Definitely the writing on the wall was that they will be fully x86 by some dates And it.

349
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:49,369
Speaker 0: they managed to get through that transition without a problem And it seems to only have benefited them.

350
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:51,179
Speaker 0: and no one is saying go back to power PC.

351
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,927
Speaker 0: No one's complaining about it anymore.

352
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:55,760
Speaker 1: There was a brief time when there were a couple of games that ran on max.

353
00:22:56,503 --> 00:22:58,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, they said they would get rid of flash.

354
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,279
Speaker 0: You know they did and it worked and flash that killed flash Everywhere as a consequence of not including an iOS.

355
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:20,238
Speaker 0: But yeah, so the report is that next year Apple is gonna ship not just their iPads and iPhones with their their own Processors that they make the a. you know the Apple CPUs there which are ARM architecture and not x86.

356
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:26,881
Speaker 0: but they're gonna ship MacBooks with ARM CPUs and We're gonna see what the straight You know.

357
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:31,360
Speaker 0: who knows if this is true or what this the strategy will be the same as the strategy last time.

358
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:39,768
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I can tell you is that a if they do this right if this happens people are gonna complain Just like they did when they switch to x86.

359
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:40,089
Speaker 0: yup.

360
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,973
Speaker 1: There'll be a few.

361
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:48,680
Speaker 1: I think there'll be more Creative applications that are used by professionals that will never support ARM or at least not I don't know.

362
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,790
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna be whatever happened last time.

363
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,700
Speaker 0: I think it's just gonna happen again.

364
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:56,780
Speaker 0: It's just gonna be a rerun of the exact same thing that happened before.

365
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:02,859
Speaker 1: It's just interesting that they went from being the non-standard option to standard with everyone else to the non-standard option again.

366
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:08,896
Speaker 0: Yep, also, I think because processors are a lot faster now than they were especially the.

367
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:16,279
Speaker 0: if Apple's putting one in a MacBook That's probably considering how much better the iPhone iPad chips are compared to the competition, right?

368
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:18,105
Speaker 0: It's interesting to see.

369
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:27,567
Speaker 0: if it says they make a 12 core 5 nanometer ARM processor To go into a MacBook like pro How powerful is that thing gonna be?

370
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,390
Speaker 0: and do they start?

371
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:33,468
Speaker 0: maybe that maybe they get around this right by not starting With like the pro right?

372
00:24:33,508 --> 00:24:35,615
Speaker 0: what if like the pro line still has x86?

373
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:36,960
Speaker 0: because those are the complaining people.

374
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:42,220
Speaker 1: So they say put out our Mac will continue to run Mac OS rather than switching to iOS.

375
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:43,124
Speaker 0: Sure.

376
00:24:43,164 --> 00:24:44,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, but I've got a run.

377
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:45,547
Speaker 0: It's needs.

378
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:46,500
Speaker 0: all you know.

379
00:24:46,882 --> 00:24:48,048
Speaker 0: Software has to be compiled.

380
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:59,849
Speaker 1: this article specifically points out that Bloomberg Speculates that Apple's first ARM based machines will be significantly lower powered MacBooks because its own chips won't be able to match Intel's performance In the higher end MacBook pros.

381
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,740
Speaker 0: I max and I don't know about that.

382
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,600
Speaker 0: But I do think I was just saying going for the lower end MacBooks to start is a good idea.

383
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,280
Speaker 0: Yeah Because someone using a lower end MacBook is not someone who's running like their own is not someone who ever gets that dialog box.

384
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,280
Speaker 0: Exactly, right, so they're just gonna be installing from the app the Mac App Store everything.

385
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:22,900
Speaker 1: Yeah The kind of person using a lower end MacBook is probably the same kind of person on the Windows side.

386
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,417
Speaker 1: I just like a lower end Windows PC.

387
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,005
Speaker 1: They're not bad in.

388
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:36,799
Speaker 0: Apple will have some way where they could go into the App Store Right and like recompile every single or cross compile every almost every application in there.

389
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:41,173
Speaker 0: Right to get them to run on, you know arm instead of x86.

390
00:25:41,294 --> 00:25:42,397
Speaker 1: It'll be really interesting.

391
00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:58,284
Speaker 1: What happens with the third-party software that's relying on heavily like the Adobe type stuff like the 3d rendering software all the things that are third-party and performance intensive and big that don't really care that much about Apple because There are.

392
00:25:58,304 --> 00:26:02,718
Speaker 1: there were like ARM Windows PCs and most software does not work on them.

393
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:05,905
Speaker 1: Like.

394
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:07,733
Speaker 1: I don't even know if Adobe stuff would work on that.

395
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:09,260
Speaker 1: I don't think there was ever ARM Adobe.

396
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:16,109
Speaker 0: You know Adobe would have to read it to recompile everything for ARM, yeah, and I don't know if they would Why wouldn't they?

397
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:16,615
Speaker 1: I don't know?

398
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,559
Speaker 1: No one's done it for those Windows ARM PCs.

399
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:23,271
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you know, this would be like a transition period right?

400
00:26:23,311 --> 00:26:25,500
Speaker 0: It's like put it out on non Pro.

401
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,972
Speaker 0: So it's like okay who's running Photoshop on a non Pro MacBook, right?

402
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:36,916
Speaker 0: But it's sort of like alright now Adobe It's like you guess what you better Right get ready to release photo if you want to get these custom, you know,

403
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:54,598
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, I found an article talking about the the Surface Pro X because that's Microsoft's new newish ARM based Laptop like it's a tablet laptop very similar Goals and the reviews are not glowing about its performance and compatibility,

404
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,120
Speaker 0: right?

405
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,488
Speaker 0: But that has an off-the-shelf ARM processor.

406
00:26:57,508 --> 00:27:00,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, they won't do the like integrated design that Apple likes to do.

407
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:02,967
Speaker 0: It doesn't have the best ARM processor.

408
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:07,000
Speaker 0: Probably the best consumer ARM processor that you could get which is when Apple made.

409
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'll be the line.

410
00:27:07,984 --> 00:27:10,814
Speaker 1: because the line from this like to see where this is going.

411
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:19,809
Speaker 1: because the line from this article other article Which isn't that old quote more intense tense apps like Photoshop do technically run on this computer But they're so slow.

412
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:20,415
Speaker 1: They'd might as well.

413
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:22,184
Speaker 1: not Microsoft says anyone.

414
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:31,258
Speaker 0: anyone who come yeah, but anyone who complains about this transition if and when it happens I'm just gonna say you went through this before and it wasn't a really big deal.

415
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:31,700
Speaker 0: at the end.

416
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:33,048
Speaker 0: Did you complain then?

417
00:27:33,108 --> 00:27:34,295
Speaker 0: but it ended up just fine.

418
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:35,662
Speaker 0: You're not complaining now Are you still?

419
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:35,943
Speaker 0: are you?

420
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:36,104
Speaker 0: listen?

421
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,539
Speaker 0: if someone has been complaining for that many years to go back to power PC?

422
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,080
Speaker 0: That person is allowed to complain about arm.

423
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,224
Speaker 1: I feel like a lot of the thing.

424
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:47,603
Speaker 1: no one else is that we're supported on powers of power PC and we're not Supported.

425
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:50,380
Speaker 1: when they went to Intel were things that were old and dying anyway.

426
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:52,104
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were.

427
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:52,626
Speaker 0: you know, they were.

428
00:27:52,646 --> 00:28:01,540
Speaker 0: a thing is if an app is maintained, you know Actively maintained app that means that there's a developer with the source code to recompile it and cross compile.

429
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:09,605
Speaker 0: Other article which is from like November like a software that's lost is the old software that yeah I only have a binary of.

430
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:13,160
Speaker 1: but the article does not say that Adobe has committed to supporting arm.

431
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:22,159
Speaker 1: The article says that Microsoft says that Adobe is committed to creating 64-bit arm versions of Creative Cloud apps But there is no timeline.

432
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:27,415
Speaker 1: And it also says gaming is quite literally a non-starter.

433
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:31,160
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Mings a non-starter on a Mac book.

434
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,613
Speaker 1: So I'd say this is a nail in the coffin, but the sarcophagus is already in the pyramid.

435
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:36,155
Speaker 1: like there's.

436
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,700
Speaker 1: no more nails are necessary.

437
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:39,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, GG.

438
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:45,118
Speaker 1: So one last little bit of news that uh, I guess is another writing on the wall article.

439
00:28:47,002 --> 00:28:48,940
Speaker 1: People are of course cutting their cords.

440
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,596
Speaker 1: They're killing their cable television faster than cool.

441
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,900
Speaker 0: Thank you that you think that would have slowed down a little bit because people are stuck at home.

442
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:59,829
Speaker 1: You know why it's probably have more time to get it done.

443
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:00,190
Speaker 0: they got.

444
00:29:00,712 --> 00:29:03,078
Speaker 1: no no, no, it's real simple ain't?

445
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:03,740
Speaker 1: no sports?

446
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:05,065
Speaker 0: Oh, that's true.

447
00:29:05,105 --> 00:29:07,535
Speaker 1: And that's all anyone actually cares about anymore.

448
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:11,100
Speaker 1: The only thing is actually People are sports and Fox News.

449
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:13,120
Speaker 0: Where was the lawsuit?

450
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,273
Speaker 0: Sports TV like no live sports lawsuit.

451
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,577
Speaker 0: I think there was a lawsuit was it?

452
00:29:19,597 --> 00:29:20,078
Speaker 0: in New York?

453
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:26,719
Speaker 1: the last quarter There were 1.7 million lost subscribers the largest decline in a first quarter ever.

454
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:32,049
Speaker 1: They're projecting a total to 2020 decline of 8 million.

455
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,200
Speaker 1: and what's crazy is these big numbers have been happening for a long time.

456
00:29:36,761 --> 00:29:43,290
Speaker 1: I think people just like forget how many people have cable and just haven't stopped paying for it yet.

457
00:29:44,805 --> 00:29:53,780
Speaker 0: yeah, I forget if there's a Lawsuit in this or not, but I read a lot of articles recently talking about how people are paying cable for live sports.

458
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,988
Speaker 0: Yep, right and there's like extra.

459
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:56,911
Speaker 0: it's not just like you're.

460
00:29:57,052 --> 00:29:59,380
Speaker 0: it's not like I'm buying cable because I want live sports.

461
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,800
Speaker 0: It's like there's specific line items on your cable bill because you're buying like, you know, a Major League Baseball package.

462
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get the package without ESPN and without like MSG or whatever.

463
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:09,860
Speaker 1: It's just way cheaper, right?

464
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,521
Speaker 0: You can't?

465
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:14,676
Speaker 0: I don't think you can get without ESPN, but you're not paying for specifically extra sports.

466
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:15,519
Speaker 0: shit, right?

467
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:23,340
Speaker 1: Yep But if you if you're one extra then shouldn't they have to pay you back if there's no sports, right?

468
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:35,000
Speaker 0: So it's like you're paying extra Specifically for live sports like it's an add-on feature Like if you got a car and it said, okay We're gonna add $100 to your car for special paint and the car didn't have the special paint because they ran out.

469
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,428
Speaker 0: Yep, we ran out of sports, right?

470
00:30:37,488 --> 00:30:40,859
Speaker 0: You're paying $100 extra on your cable bill, but we ran out of sports.

471
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:42,170
Speaker 0: But we ran out of sports.

472
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,320
Speaker 0: There ain't no sports to watch.

473
00:30:43,902 --> 00:30:48,397
Speaker 0: So they're still charging people for it because it's like well you still have the channel, right?

474
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:49,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's on?

475
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,759
Speaker 1: What's on ESPN?

476
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:52,202
Speaker 0: It's.

477
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:53,848
Speaker 0: it's not that it's not ESPN though.

478
00:30:53,928 --> 00:31:00,439
Speaker 0: Everyone has ESPN even with the most basic of cable, but like any What's actually on a sports network right now?

479
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:02,579
Speaker 0: all kinds of crazy stuff.

480
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:05,768
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point is that I don't.

481
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:08,477
Speaker 0: I think there might have been lawsuits or at least lots of complaining.

482
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:10,580
Speaker 0: people want their fucking Money back, right?

483
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,223
Speaker 0: Canceling cable.

484
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:13,448
Speaker 0: They want their fucking money.

485
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,416
Speaker 0: They're like, hey, you can't be charging me for that.

486
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:17,864
Speaker 0: You didn't give it to me There isn't any.

487
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:18,908
Speaker 1: yeah, you didn't bundle it.

488
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:19,571
Speaker 1: I paid for that.

489
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:20,756
Speaker 1: There's a line item for it.

490
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:23,466
Speaker 0: Yeah So I think there might have.

491
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:23,808
Speaker 0: there was.

492
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:26,200
Speaker 0: I can't find a story about it right now while I'm doing the show.

493
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:36,680
Speaker 1: Yeah the sport the tea the court-cutting thing is interesting though because it seems like the trend was Accelerating coming into 2020 already for a lot of reasons mostly because the streaming services are all pretty good.

494
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:42,260
Speaker 1: The ecosystem has gotten to the point to where everyone's willing to pay for like between two and four different streaming services.

495
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:44,709
Speaker 0: Well, and it is less cheaper than cable.

496
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:52,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's just less and less things That you would be like, ah, you know, if I don't have cable, I can't watch this.

497
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:56,440
Speaker 0: It's like what it's almost no this is left except for the sports.

498
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,659
Speaker 1: yeah, even if you're not pirating like it's pretty easy to have access to most media.

499
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:06,304
Speaker 1: and but it seems like the kovat 19 pandemic is actually Accelerating this.

500
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:08,635
Speaker 1: because on one hand there's no sports.

501
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:14,034
Speaker 1: So One of the main reasons people even turn on a TV is not there.

502
00:32:14,054 --> 00:32:15,037
Speaker 1: so they might question.

503
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:15,960
Speaker 1: Why am I paying for cable?

504
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,507
Speaker 1: I don't even turn on my TV anymore.

505
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:20,220
Speaker 1: And the other half of it is with massive unemployment.

506
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:23,900
Speaker 1: Cable is one of the things people can just cut if they have to.

507
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:33,720
Speaker 1: It's true if you have no money And if you have no money And there's nothing to watch because there's no new content because there's no sports like killing cable is the obvious choice.

508
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,655
Speaker 0: That'll save you also, I think you know, you have time at home, right?

509
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:39,060
Speaker 0: You think y'all got all this time.

510
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,606
Speaker 0: I need to spend it watching TV.

511
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,434
Speaker 0: But also I got all this time.

512
00:32:42,454 --> 00:32:47,139
Speaker 0: I got time to Spend, you know as I spend money to get content without effort.

513
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:48,303
Speaker 0: Well now I got time.

514
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:55,880
Speaker 0: I can put effort into plugging shit into my TV and figuring out how to get content You know without having to pay for cable.

515
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many desperate families are turning to their 12 year old kid who's teaching them how to pirate bay on the HDPC?

516
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:04,720
Speaker 0: All right, just getting an Apple TV and plugging a network cable into it.

517
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:14,050
Speaker 1: Yeah Either way, you even just plug in the network cable into whatever like stupid smart TV They got and making that menu that they've never clicked into work.

518
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:16,056
Speaker 0: Yeah Wi-Fi with the smart TV.

519
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:17,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, whatever.

520
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:24,397
Speaker 1: alright, I think we can just jump right into things of the day.

521
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:44,329
Speaker 1: so as you know me and Emily are continuing our Review and discussion of every Disney theatrical animation and one of the things we I learned When we watched Dumbo was that Dumbo was one of the first films ever to use in early voice synthesizer vocoder type thing Like a like a like an early version of a talk box.

522
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:52,390
Speaker 1: So okay that technology son of ox was pioneered the year earlier and what I have here is a YouTube video.

523
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:54,077
Speaker 1: That is a film a 1940 film.

524
00:33:54,097 --> 00:34:05,633
Speaker 1: It's short It's like three minutes long and it's basically a tech demo of the son of ox voice synthesizer talk box program Mm-hmm.

525
00:34:06,014 --> 00:34:07,080
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

526
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,868
Speaker 0: So it's a. so it's a machine that synthesizes human speech.

527
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:15,261
Speaker 0: So it's more like it's not a digital computer because it's 1940.

528
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,404
Speaker 1: It's more like a talk about.

529
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:19,996
Speaker 1: it's like the thing that Peter Frampton Used to make his guitar talk.

530
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,824
Speaker 1: It's the first iteration of that.

531
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:23,168
Speaker 1: Do you know how that actually worked?

532
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:25,536
Speaker 1: That's all analog.

533
00:34:25,556 --> 00:34:27,909
Speaker 1: there's no digital technology required for that at all.

534
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:32,509
Speaker 0: I thought it was just like, you know, like just a guitar pedal that just like bends.

535
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:41,103
Speaker 1: the How talk boxes work is Basically, they will pipe the sound like your guitar or whatever it is.

536
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:43,270
Speaker 1: You can put any audio into them into your mouth.

537
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:57,450
Speaker 1: It's audio vibrating in that tube that you see him sucking on when he's doing it into his mouth and Then he just moves his mouth like he's talking and The sound will come out of his mouth modulated by his own mouth.

538
00:34:57,751 --> 00:35:01,528
Speaker 1: But instead of his vocal cords making the sound it's the instrument making the sound.

539
00:35:02,372 --> 00:35:05,003
Speaker 0: So but you still have to have a person involved here.

540
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:11,806
Speaker 0: Yes, you use the person's physical To be not really synthesizing speech if a human mouth is doing it.

541
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:14,457
Speaker 1: This is a different kind of audio stuff.

542
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:19,569
Speaker 1: this is more like Though like the way they used to do reverb, you know reverb worked in the old days.

543
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:25,490
Speaker 1: You'd have a big box and you plug a microphone into one end and a speaker into the other end.

544
00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:31,230
Speaker 1: So this is basically a synthesizer where you plug and a pure signal in one end.

545
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:37,270
Speaker 1: You plug it into someone's throat and then you use the shape of their mouth to shape and modulate that noise.

546
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:40,308
Speaker 1: So they don't actually say anything and the instrument comes out.

547
00:35:40,911 --> 00:35:42,256
Speaker 0: Why not just fucking talk then?

548
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:44,483
Speaker 1: because they want it to not be a human voice.

549
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:46,330
Speaker 1: they want it to sound like something else.

550
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:50,741
Speaker 1: You've seen Peter Frampton perform right?

551
00:35:51,384 --> 00:35:52,388
Speaker 1: Yeah his guitar talks.

552
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:52,670
Speaker 1: That's it.

553
00:35:52,790 --> 00:36:01,519
Speaker 1: that's the technology and this video is the precursor to that technology being debuted to the world and The wall.

554
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:04,718
Speaker 1: this seems kind of shit like it sounds pretty shitty by any modern standard.

555
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:09,969
Speaker 1: like you can't imagine why someone would use this technology, but Nothing like that existed before.

556
00:36:11,331 --> 00:36:16,947
Speaker 1: Sure, like this is actually groundbreaking kind of amazing technology and it actually works pretty seamlessly.

557
00:36:16,987 --> 00:36:20,916
Speaker 1: all things considered Okay, all right, what do you got?

558
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:35,897
Speaker 0: All right, so since there's no sports, let's go back in time to the year I was born 1982. but right it's like if we go back far enough, it's like well, you know, I've all the sports since 1980 something I've seen Not all of them, but enough of them.

559
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:38,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like I want to see some new sports.

560
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:49,586
Speaker 0: Let's go back to what I can't remember so that the year I was born I definitely don't remember this because it wasn't even on American TV as far as I can tell you Wasn't until like 1988 that I even recognized sports exist and paid attention to them.

561
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:52,050
Speaker 0: I Recognized sports exist earlier than that.

562
00:36:52,070 --> 00:37:00,090
Speaker 1: Yeah the problem was I was watching the Simpsons and Occasionally a Simpsons premiere would be delayed a little bit and you'd miss the beginning of the episode because football took too long.

563
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:00,973
Speaker 1: So I actually hated.

564
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:04,986
Speaker 0: tell it watch football and then during the football they'd be like yo.

565
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:15,817
Speaker 1: as soon as football's over Simpsons you'd be like, oh, yeah If the football went into OT you'd miss the first five minutes of Simpsons anyway Until I watch TV sports.

566
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:18,545
Speaker 0: I don't know which country this is.

567
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:20,772
Speaker 0: Sorry to the country that it is from I can't.

568
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:22,643
Speaker 0: it seems like based on the language.

569
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:23,568
Speaker 0: It's a Dutch country.

570
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,236
Speaker 0: could be You know, well, that's good.

571
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:27,099
Speaker 0: It could be the Netherlands.

572
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,042
Speaker 0: It could be Sweden.

573
00:37:28,444 --> 00:37:29,608
Speaker 0: I'm not sure exactly.

574
00:37:29,628 --> 00:37:30,210
Speaker 0: it could be Denmark.

575
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:32,445
Speaker 0: I don't know which country this is from.

576
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:35,655
Speaker 0: I'm sorry It's one of those countries.

577
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:51,409
Speaker 0: they had a televised event that was a big deal called World Sports Masters and this tweet is actually from 2015 But the entirety of the program in five parts is on YouTube as long as no one takes it down.

578
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:55,223
Speaker 0: And what this was is something that needs to be replicated.

579
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:55,945
Speaker 0: ASAP.

580
00:37:56,286 --> 00:37:57,270
Speaker 1: looks like it kept going.

581
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:04,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, but it should exist today right in 2020.

582
00:38:04,094 --> 00:38:21,118
Speaker 0: But what they did is they took many many legendary athletes of the day right Wayne Gretzky sugar Ray Leonard Palay Bjorn Borg Michael Keegan all these, you know, like so the most famous soccer tennis Skiing guy.

583
00:38:21,178 --> 00:38:22,429
Speaker 0: I forget his name, right?

584
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:30,950
Speaker 0: You know athletes of the day and they had them compete against each other directly in other sports.

585
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,233
Speaker 1: Just the omega-thon for sports professionals Exactly.

586
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:45,451
Speaker 1: So here you have in this short in this tweet if you are LeBron Let's see you catch a touchdown pass and we're gonna do a thing and then run a 5k then we're gonna do some biathlon Right.

587
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:48,218
Speaker 0: So here the tweet just has a short clip.

588
00:38:48,258 --> 00:38:56,165
Speaker 0: That's the most exciting part, which is a very short sprint race between Bjorn Borg sugar Ray Leonard Palay and Wayne Gretzky.

589
00:38:56,245 --> 00:39:03,250
Speaker 0: It's a little unfair Because Palay at this time is at least like 20 years older than the other people involved.

590
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:12,459
Speaker 0: So just keep that in mind when looking at the results here, but if you want to watch the whole thing It's in five parts on YouTube.

591
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:14,970
Speaker 0: I didn't watch the whole thing because that's long.

592
00:39:15,151 --> 00:39:22,505
Speaker 0: This is pretty good, but maybe I will if I get bored, but it's still Fascinating and amazing and they should do this again, right?

593
00:39:22,545 --> 00:39:28,490
Speaker 0: Let's see, you know The current world's best athletes up against each other, right?

594
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:29,839
Speaker 0: Why shouldn't we?

595
00:39:30,308 --> 00:39:34,908
Speaker 1: Oh Apparently Peter Frampton is was about to go on tour and then the pandemic stopped him.

596
00:39:35,912 --> 00:39:36,192
Speaker 0: Okay.

597
00:39:36,413 --> 00:39:37,857
Speaker 1: I didn't know he was gonna go see him.

598
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:38,659
Speaker 1: I don't know.

599
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,870
Speaker 1: maybe I've never seen Peter Frampton in person.

600
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:44,642
Speaker 0: All right good reason for that met a moment.

601
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:47,901
Speaker 1: Uh Guess well at some point we'll read again.

602
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:53,200
Speaker 1: I don't actually have any free time So I actually haven't been reading like life's been forgot how to read.

603
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,205
Speaker 1: life's been weirdly busy.

604
00:39:55,446 --> 00:40:00,424
Speaker 1: still like every night I don't finish all the things I need to do in the day and then it's like midnight and I go to bed.

605
00:40:00,444 --> 00:40:02,798
Speaker 1: I Still need my weekends.

606
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,908
Speaker 1: So we haven't read much.

607
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:16,727
Speaker 1: hopefully when it gets a little warmer I'll go out to the park and hide and just read and then we'll catch up on the tale of Genji and then perhaps that Nine-fox gambit will be the next book because multiple people keep bothering us to do it and I suspect we'll like it.

608
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,576
Speaker 1: So we'll see Mm-hmm.

609
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:22,050
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I'd say look for us at your next convention.

610
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:37,559
Speaker 1: but well so if there are any online conventions that you think we should be a part of you want to see us there or you want us to go to one of These online conventions and present on a topic that for one some reason we've never presented on that Maybe you think we should.

611
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:39,450
Speaker 1: you want to see our weird stuff?

612
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,629
Speaker 1: You want to see the panels that no one's ever?

613
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,677
Speaker 1: Accepted like now's the time.

614
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:52,664
Speaker 1: if you convince some events to invite us to perform We will bring something to perform even if it's something that say even packs and mag fast.

615
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:54,449
Speaker 1: We're like, yeah, we'll pass on that.

616
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:59,639
Speaker 0: Also, uh, I updated you might.

617
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:00,461
Speaker 0: you won't notice.

618
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:01,785
Speaker 0: you shouldn't notice any difference.

619
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:03,310
Speaker 1: if you notice the difference there's a problem.

620
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:08,042
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the the server that the forum is hosted on I updated.

621
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:10,549
Speaker 0: it's the parts that you can't see.

622
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:17,392
Speaker 0: so There was a small amount of downtime and also That's it.

623
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:19,940
Speaker 0: So it should be working perfectly now.

624
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:22,349
Speaker 0: And so let me know if you see any problems with it.

625
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:28,290
Speaker 0: But otherwise, yeah, it should be a really solid and good to go for five years or so.

626
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:34,792
Speaker 1: All right kitchen appliances great We're.

627
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:40,070
Speaker 1: uh, Mondays are tough because like not gonna talk about work stuff really like if you have Monday show.

628
00:41:40,552 --> 00:41:44,630
Speaker 0: I didn't realize he rim told me the show idea and I was like I didn't protest.

629
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:51,336
Speaker 0: I was like, oh good idea, but my brain for some reason like put it in as a Thursday Even though I know it's Monday.

630
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:56,260
Speaker 0: So as soon as I put it two and two together, I was like, wait a minute That's not a Monday idea.

631
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,634
Speaker 1: Here's my stretch number one What's the main purpose of geek nights?

632
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:05,810
Speaker 1: to get the person who's only into silver age silver surfer comics to at least take a look?

633
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,334
Speaker 1: At a comp.

634
00:42:07,374 --> 00:42:10,910
Speaker 0: I don't think someone who cares about computers needs to know about kitchen appliances.

635
00:42:11,313 --> 00:42:18,762
Speaker 1: I think they do though because the Minor point I would make but again, this is a stretch Is that a lot of you listen to our Monday episodes your nerds.

636
00:42:18,782 --> 00:42:20,530
Speaker 1: a lot of you work in IT or your code?

637
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:27,350
Speaker 1: How do you know how you feel when someone asks you for help with their computer or is even paying you to help them with?

638
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:32,790
Speaker 1: Their computer and the problem is obvious and you feel like they're stupid like just plug your mouse in dude.

639
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,013
Speaker 1: Like that feeling.

640
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:41,060
Speaker 1: that is exactly how the dishwasher repair person feels when they come in and they look at your dishwasher And you're like, please help me.

641
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,989
Speaker 1: I flooded my house.

642
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:55,190
Speaker 0: Yep, I'm sure that I imagine that most people out there who can build a computer from parts and fix their computer And do every computer thing Wouldn't know the first fucking thing to do with their dishwasher.

643
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,340
Speaker 1: Yep Same thing with cars and I guess the the my the meta point.

644
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:13,110
Speaker 1: the stretch to make this fit into a Monday night episode of Geek nights is that if you truly are a geek if you want to know things about things You should understand at least the basics of the technology that you use on a regular basis.

645
00:43:13,472 --> 00:43:15,602
Speaker 1: Make it one step less wizard-like.

646
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:17,872
Speaker 1: you might not be able to fix it Like.

647
00:43:18,233 --> 00:43:25,759
Speaker 1: I might be able to identify the problem with a car, but I might not be able to fix that problem But you should at least have some idea of like.

648
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,210
Speaker 1: why is that refrigerator better than that refrigerator?

649
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,810
Speaker 1: Why do some people have a second refrigerator in their garage with a door on the top?

650
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:39,710
Speaker 1: Like why do people like rim and scott get so weird about gas stoves versus electric stoves?

651
00:43:39,971 --> 00:43:43,630
Speaker 1: You should at least know enough to understand the context of those questions.

652
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:50,010
Speaker 1: Also someday you too will be in your late 30s and you will actually care about which refrigerator you own.

653
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:51,969
Speaker 1: You'll care a lot more than you think you will.

654
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:53,555
Speaker 0: Well, that's all true.

655
00:43:53,615 --> 00:43:57,630
Speaker 0: It's still not a Monday episode, but I guess we have no choice because we have no other idea.

656
00:43:57,751 --> 00:44:06,350
Speaker 0: So send your Monday show ideas At front row crew.com or via any other internet communication mechanism.

657
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:12,309
Speaker 0: Hopefully, you know how to use some means of contacting us and know how to use Google to find a way to contact us.

658
00:44:12,781 --> 00:44:12,885
Speaker 0: so

659
00:44:13,632 --> 00:44:23,602
Speaker 1: fridges the cool thing about fridges is that with the exception of a few weird ones like a propane fridge or a Peltier which are not like they're not really normal or a

660
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:25,169
Speaker 0: super old-fashioned icebox

661
00:44:26,115 --> 00:44:28,170
Speaker 1: True one that takes like literal blocks of ice

662
00:44:28,572 --> 00:44:29,777
Speaker 0: But yes that kind of like

663
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:34,861
Speaker 1: since the what 50s fridges have pretty much just worked Mostly the same like.

664
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:36,690
Speaker 1: not much has changed in that technology.

665
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:39,639
Speaker 0: well, I think that's something that I think is universal.

666
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:53,686
Speaker 0: amongst the major kitchen appliances is that Generally speaking compared to a lot of other Expensive large items you might buy they are extremely reliable.

667
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:55,775
Speaker 1: Yep, right I mean my grandparents.

668
00:44:55,815 --> 00:45:10,426
Speaker 1: so they had a this old GE fridge from like 1951 and Until they sold their house when I was an adult That fridge was still working had not only been unplugged like three times in its life was totally fine.

669
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:11,669
Speaker 1: Literally nothing wrong with it.

670
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:14,337
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know.

671
00:45:14,397 --> 00:45:17,310
Speaker 0: cars like, you know, they wear down a lot.

672
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:21,770
Speaker 0: But I guess that's because they have more moving parts and they interact with like road bumping them and stuff like that.

673
00:45:22,752 --> 00:45:26,230
Speaker 0: And out they got in the elements that deal with hot and cold temperature changes.

674
00:45:26,531 --> 00:45:28,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, that can affect them in many ways.

675
00:45:28,077 --> 00:45:31,310
Speaker 1: very rarely do two fridges collide with each other at 45 miles an hour.

676
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,024
Speaker 0: Right, exactly, right.

677
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:34,981
Speaker 0: So the Appliances in your house.

678
00:45:35,021 --> 00:45:49,034
Speaker 0: Not only are they not Facing such conditions that cause them to wear down as quickly But I think the people making them right are not trying to make ones that are like intentionally shitty that break Right, but also you

679
00:45:49,054 --> 00:45:49,335
Speaker 1: don't want

680
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:49,696
Speaker 0: to deal

681
00:45:49,797 --> 00:46:03,029
Speaker 1: they have to kind of just work because the user experience design You know Like if you're designing a interface or a computer or something The user experience design has to sort of assume that the people using them understand nothing like nothing at all.

682
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:04,283
Speaker 1: little kid I'll just start using it.

683
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:06,217
Speaker 0: It's like with a car.

684
00:46:06,237 --> 00:46:07,809
Speaker 0: you at least have to learn something.

685
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,662
Speaker 0: You'd learn how to drive how to use all these buttons and things.

686
00:46:10,722 --> 00:46:11,586
Speaker 0: right, you know.

687
00:46:11,627 --> 00:46:13,697
Speaker 0: with a refrigerator You don't you don't know anything.

688
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:14,421
Speaker 0: It's just a door.

689
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:15,104
Speaker 1: It's just magic.

690
00:46:15,124 --> 00:46:18,329
Speaker 1: No, you there's a In there.

691
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:21,923
Speaker 0: Right, even a dishwasher these days is like you push.

692
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:26,290
Speaker 0: basically they have a bunch of buttons on them But you basically push clean my fucking dishes start, right?

693
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:26,932
Speaker 0: And that's it.

694
00:46:27,273 --> 00:46:32,030
Speaker 1: I do use different cycles on the dishwasher, but I have realized we did a show on laundry a long time ago.

695
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:33,969
Speaker 1: So I'm probably iterating and I'll link to that one.

696
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:50,670
Speaker 1: but I find that a lot of people who even if they've had a dishwasher or a washer or a dryer or a Stove for their entire lives like decade-plus there will be buttons and options on those things that they have never pressed Do not know what they do and are in curious.

697
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:55,426
Speaker 0: I know what all the ones on my dishwasher do because I read the manual I also did.

698
00:46:55,507 --> 00:46:58,721
Speaker 1: I don't have use them all But I know what they all I use, you know what you want.

699
00:46:58,741 --> 00:46:59,465
Speaker 0: I use auto.

700
00:46:59,505 --> 00:47:00,470
Speaker 0: That's the one I use.

701
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:05,029
Speaker 1: Oh, I use a normal load, but sometimes I use heavy load.

702
00:47:06,111 --> 00:47:10,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only thing I don't use is the one that's like the heat drive.

703
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,809
Speaker 1: I do use that in one specific rare use case.

704
00:47:15,591 --> 00:47:22,897
Speaker 1: Okay, that use case is if we're having a party at our apartment with a lot of people and a lot of food and but Then I make sure there's no plastic.

705
00:47:22,938 --> 00:47:32,689
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, because the thing is in a party like that 99% of the dishes are glasses and plates and I want them to be dry Quickly so they can be used again or so I can refill the dishwasher.

706
00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:35,190
Speaker 1: But that's like an edge case.

707
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:46,909
Speaker 1: but my point is if you own something and you're gonna own it for a long time and You are a geek or a technologist or a person at least know what every button on that thing does I'm not saying push all those buttons.

708
00:47:47,251 --> 00:47:53,623
Speaker 1: There are bad buttons on things that you should never push but you should at least know what that bad button will do like if?

709
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:59,730
Speaker 1: Imagine if someone just turns on the clean function on an oven but doesn't quite know what that actually does.

710
00:48:00,052 --> 00:48:00,434
Speaker 0: They might.

711
00:48:00,474 --> 00:48:02,668
Speaker 0: I saw a video just the other day.

712
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:15,233
Speaker 0: somebody Wanted to make pizza in at home All right, and they're their oven would not get hot enough because most home ovens go to up 400 maybe 500 go to 550.

713
00:48:15,233 --> 00:48:17,303
Speaker 0: I think that's still not hot enough for pizza.

714
00:48:17,725 --> 00:48:18,870
Speaker 1: Not another for that kind of piece.

715
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,160
Speaker 1: You're not making a pizza oven like 650.

716
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:28,370
Speaker 0: whatever pizza ovens are way are like try like 700 C. Yep, right pizza ovens are crazy hot.

717
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:31,559
Speaker 0: So you could buy like they do.

718
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,410
Speaker 0: make some home pizza ovens that get crazy hot that you can buy.

719
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:37,078
Speaker 0: Or you can set up a brick oven with a fire situation.

720
00:48:37,118 --> 00:48:38,562
Speaker 1: internet says pizza recipes.

721
00:48:38,663 --> 00:48:40,970
Speaker 1: Generally 450 is the most anyone needs.

722
00:48:42,113 --> 00:48:44,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, the point is is that this dude?

723
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,060
Speaker 0: What he did is he said hey, I know how my oven works.

724
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:54,650
Speaker 0: There's a clean setting and the auto clean setting will make my oven hot enough.

725
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,315
Speaker 0: So the oven can get that hot.

726
00:48:56,335 --> 00:49:00,688
Speaker 0: but if you activate that setting the oven will lock itself shut.

727
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:03,229
Speaker 1: Yep I was waiting for that.

728
00:49:04,154 --> 00:49:07,770
Speaker 0: He sawed off a little bit the safety mechanism.

729
00:49:08,332 --> 00:49:09,034
Speaker 0: Oh the oven.

730
00:49:09,536 --> 00:49:15,258
Speaker 0: the oven believed that it was sealed shut and locked But yet he could open it.

731
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:21,405
Speaker 0: It was very dangerous to do this But he made amazing pizza in his oven with this way.

732
00:49:21,485 --> 00:49:24,577
Speaker 1: now on one hand This this is illustrative of this point.

733
00:49:24,718 --> 00:49:29,394
Speaker 1: on one hand if you understand what the bad button does Fully understand it.

734
00:49:29,435 --> 00:49:33,629
Speaker 1: if you grok it then you can do things that you didn't think you'd be able to do.

735
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:41,710
Speaker 1: But at the same time if you kind of understand how that button works, but do not grok it You're about to be in a lot of trouble.

736
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:48,030
Speaker 0: Yeah Also, like for example, I read the manual to the oven when we moved into the apartment.

737
00:49:48,271 --> 00:49:49,376
Speaker 1: That's just what I found out.

738
00:49:49,516 --> 00:49:52,610
Speaker 1: I read the manual to every appliance I ever encounter in my life.

739
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,796
Speaker 1: Basically, it's just a thing I did.

740
00:49:53,836 --> 00:49:56,430
Speaker 0: I found out it has a feature where I can tell it.

741
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:04,830
Speaker 0: Hey, by the way oven like tomorrow morning at 7 a.m Turn on the oven and heat up to this temperature.

742
00:50:05,406 --> 00:50:06,786
Speaker 1: Oh I don't think I could wake up.

743
00:50:06,806 --> 00:50:12,010
Speaker 0: I Can wake up and the oven will be preheated already and I can just put a bread in immediately.

744
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:15,270
Speaker 0: I don't have to like wake up to turn the oven on him to have it preheat.

745
00:50:15,591 --> 00:50:19,788
Speaker 0: So I get 45 extra minutes of sleep because I learned about a feature on my oven.

746
00:50:20,209 --> 00:50:25,850
Speaker 1: Yep I learned the only thing I learned about on my oven that I didn't know because it wasn't in the user guide It was only in the service manual.

747
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:36,492
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm a nerd but I actually do find and read the service manuals to every appliance I have if I can Because they tell you a lot more info and it explained some features I didn't know.

748
00:50:36,853 --> 00:50:49,929
Speaker 1: there's a. there's multiple ways to regulate the air intake for the four different burners and for the oven in the broiler So that depending on the quality of the flame you can increase or decrease the air Depending on the quality of the fuel that's coming in.

749
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:55,249
Speaker 1: Oh, so like if it burns a little yellow like you could fix that by changing the air intake slightly.

750
00:50:56,232 --> 00:51:03,329
Speaker 0: One thing I did do is I have a. you know Cuz ovens have their own thermometer that they use for preheating so they know when they've preheated it up.

751
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:05,597
Speaker 0: But you can't ever really trust those.

752
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:09,730
Speaker 0: right, you know a lot of times like, you know people they preheat the oven.

753
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,329
Speaker 0: The oven says I'm ready and each and it's not actually as hot as it says it is.

754
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:17,786
Speaker 0: So I have a separate oven thermometer, which everyone should have.

755
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:18,368
Speaker 0: they're so cheap.

756
00:51:19,533 --> 00:51:24,496
Speaker 0: You put it in the oven and then you can look through the window and see what the actual Temperature is in the oven.

757
00:51:24,837 --> 00:51:25,521
Speaker 0: right for real.

758
00:51:25,661 --> 00:51:27,350
Speaker 0: Not the one it's lying to you about.

759
00:51:28,373 --> 00:51:35,148
Speaker 0: And I noticed that like hey every time it says it's preheated It's actually like 15 degrees short of you know, where it's supposed where I want it to be.

760
00:51:36,073 --> 00:51:49,747
Speaker 0: so I've checked the manual for the oven and I was able to Calibrate the thermometer on the oven and tell it hey heat up 15 degrees hotter than you normally do and now The thermometer in the oven matches the thermometer on them.

761
00:51:49,808 --> 00:51:49,989
Speaker 0: Yeah

762
00:51:51,790 --> 00:52:04,690
Speaker 1: so in terms of ovens like we know I mean we've already gone on for a while on the show, but Know how your oven works I guess they're usually pretty simple like the user manuals are only like six or seven pages tops usually with a bunch of diagrams.

763
00:52:06,952 --> 00:52:09,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, and don't fuck with your oven if it's a gas oven.

764
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:15,058
Speaker 0: Yeah Don't fuck with gas.

765
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:15,401
Speaker 0: Yep.

766
00:52:15,421 --> 00:52:16,428
Speaker 0: I don't really.

767
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:18,076
Speaker 0: I mean Don't fuck with electric oven either.

768
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,140
Speaker 0: you could hurt yourself there too.

769
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:24,240
Speaker 1: Yep, but uh at least electric ovens Or at least for me like not everybody the same.

770
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:28,399
Speaker 1: I do know a lot about household electronics Like I could deal with ovened installation.

771
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:28,921
Speaker 0: Yes.

772
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:33,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might electrocute yourself or burn yourself But with a gas oven you could blow up your whole place.

773
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:34,250
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

774
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:39,710
Speaker 1: Also, I am very confident that I can stop all the electricity coming into my apartment very easily.

775
00:52:40,051 --> 00:52:43,584
Speaker 1: I'm not actually clear on where or how I could stop the gas coming in.

776
00:52:43,905 --> 00:52:45,129
Speaker 1: None of that is accessible to me.

777
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:54,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, if the if the oven is leaking gas and I've turned the oven off completely then I'm at a loss and after run Yep, pretty much you open all the windows get the fuck out.

778
00:52:55,417 --> 00:52:55,586
Speaker 0: Yep.

779
00:52:57,231 --> 00:52:59,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, somehow I'm actually surprised.

780
00:52:59,498 --> 00:53:00,360
Speaker 1: It's just kind of an aside.

781
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:08,850
Speaker 1: I'm really surprised how relatively rare It is that people blow themselves up with gas ovens because I've seen the way people think a lot of people just don't have gas.

782
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,135
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, they're pretty they're.

783
00:53:10,276 --> 00:53:11,461
Speaker 0: they're more rare each day.

784
00:53:11,501 --> 00:53:14,297
Speaker 1: Like I've seen the way people live their lives I'm shocked.

785
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:15,369
Speaker 1: They don't blow up more often.

786
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:16,992
Speaker 1: Like.

787
00:53:17,032 --> 00:53:20,910
Speaker 1: I want to see the stats like how many are out there versus how many blow up at any given day.

788
00:53:21,613 --> 00:53:24,525
Speaker 0: It's surprisingly difficult to actually like blow up right?

789
00:53:24,565 --> 00:53:25,730
Speaker 0: It's easy to start a fire.

790
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's hard to explode.

791
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:33,196
Speaker 0: You have to really leak that gas and the gas smell is A very good thing.

792
00:53:33,216 --> 00:53:36,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure before the gas smell there were a lot of blow-ups.

793
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:41,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, but imagine in a big house like you Uh, I don't know you just leave one of the burners on like you just gas is slowly coming out.

794
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:50,530
Speaker 0: Whoever had the idea to put a include a bad smell in gas that was sent to houses Saved some large number of lives.

795
00:53:50,811 --> 00:54:01,590
Speaker 1: I can give you a guy got a good thing of the day for next time that talks about the Edwardian era and the old Gas lamps and like how safety had to be added to gas because of all the problems that happen with gas.

796
00:54:03,271 --> 00:54:06,890
Speaker 1: Yep, little subtle things like at night the gas pressure would lower.

797
00:54:07,392 --> 00:54:14,969
Speaker 1: So what would happen is if someone had their gas light set too low It would go out and then gas would just start coming out not burning and that would kill everybody.

798
00:54:16,071 --> 00:54:20,025
Speaker 1: Yeah, also people tended to gas themselves in their bathrooms because of heated baths.

799
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,381
Speaker 1: Oh That was like I shouldn't exist.

800
00:54:23,421 --> 00:54:26,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was shouldn't exist Shouldn't be?

801
00:54:26,415 --> 00:54:28,510
Speaker 1: I mean we still have heated baths.

802
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:30,488
Speaker 1: We just put the dangerous part far away from us.

803
00:54:31,031 --> 00:54:36,930
Speaker 1: But it's still like if you have a house it's still in your basement or maybe your garage and it's still moderately dangerous.

804
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:37,594
Speaker 1: But that's not.

805
00:54:37,614 --> 00:54:38,801
Speaker 1: we're talking about kitchen appliances.

806
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:39,746
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about how.

807
00:54:39,787 --> 00:54:49,887
Speaker 0: water heaters Yeah, so I mean if you couldn't tell we don't know that much about how appliances work because we haven't talked that much about it You know because it's not like we.

808
00:54:49,928 --> 00:54:50,692
Speaker 0: you know Like we said.

809
00:54:51,074 --> 00:54:54,710
Speaker 0: people who know how to fix a computer probably don't know how to fix a dishwasher, which is true.

810
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:57,382
Speaker 0: I could not fix most things wrong with a dish.

811
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I have a good anecdote.

812
00:54:59,151 --> 00:55:03,107
Speaker 1: The reason I thought of doing this show was our dishwasher actually broke yesterday.

813
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,930
Speaker 1: It just stopped working.

814
00:55:04,872 --> 00:55:06,279
Speaker 0: So for real broke real broke.

815
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:06,982
Speaker 0: now, how did it?

816
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:07,646
Speaker 0: how did it break?

817
00:55:07,686 --> 00:55:07,887
Speaker 0: so

818
00:55:08,148 --> 00:55:20,055
Speaker 1: one day I did my wash stuff like a few days ago And I was taking the dry the dry stuff out to put it away and I noticed there was like a centimeter of water Just hanging out at the bottom of the dishwasher And I was like, hmm

819
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:21,479
Speaker 0: that aren't you?

820
00:55:21,499 --> 00:55:23,525
Speaker 0: did you clean out the little little?

821
00:55:23,746 --> 00:55:26,557
Speaker 1: I looked at it completely clean Like there's no debris down there at all.

822
00:55:26,578 --> 00:55:28,025
Speaker 1: There's a big cage, but it wasn't.

823
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:29,050
Speaker 0: it wasn't draining.

824
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:30,618
Speaker 1: It mostly drained because there was.

825
00:55:30,899 --> 00:55:32,970
Speaker 1: there was only like a centimeter of water on the bottom.

826
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:37,623
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's a lot more than a centimeter of water in it when it's actually running.

827
00:55:37,904 --> 00:55:41,469
Speaker 1: so it clearly had really to some Amount and it washed the stuff fine.

828
00:55:42,112 --> 00:55:49,450
Speaker 1: So I was like, huh and I know based on just knowledge how the out like how the draining in a dishwasher works.

829
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,640
Speaker 1: It's actually not just a drain like gravity drain.

830
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:53,910
Speaker 1: It's a more complicated mechanism for reasons.

831
00:55:54,538 --> 00:56:08,130
Speaker 1: so I started a new cycle with a dishwasher empty and I immediately interrupted the cycle because I knew from the user manual and from Experience that if you interrupt a draw of dishwasher, it will immediately enter a purge cycle.

832
00:56:09,211 --> 00:56:11,399
Speaker 1: That's the kind of stuff like as a nerd you should know.

833
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,149
Speaker 1: so I did that and it does its thing.

834
00:56:14,189 --> 00:56:18,170
Speaker 1: it goes Oh shit purging time and then I hear it and it starts pumping the water out.

835
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,996
Speaker 1: I can hear the water going down my sink.

836
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:22,466
Speaker 1: So then I it finishes the purge.

837
00:56:22,506 --> 00:56:24,979
Speaker 1: I open it waters gone Problem solved.

838
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,530
Speaker 1: this will clearly never happen again.

839
00:56:28,112 --> 00:56:33,070
Speaker 1: So then we do dishes again and now there's like two inches of water down there.

840
00:56:34,772 --> 00:56:37,424
Speaker 1: Yep, so now I got to learn things.

841
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:43,435
Speaker 1: I didn't know about dishwashers So I start taking it apart to look if there's like a deeper clog no clogs of any kind.

842
00:56:43,816 --> 00:56:54,365
Speaker 1: pretty sure the impeller that actually pumps the water out is dead or that the valves that Control the backflow have rotted and are preventing the impeller from pushing water out.

843
00:56:54,726 --> 00:57:00,263
Speaker 1: because that's to push the water out Up over a u-bend and then into the drain for reasons.

844
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,409
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into read your manual if you care about why.

845
00:57:04,311 --> 00:57:09,094
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm pretty sure what happened because based on my Investigation.

846
00:57:09,114 --> 00:57:12,430
Speaker 1: I also went found a million videos of like how to fix dishwashers.

847
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:14,150
Speaker 1: I learned a lot more about dishwashers.

848
00:57:14,612 --> 00:57:20,730
Speaker 1: But the problem is deep enough to where I would have to take this thing apart to a degree that I am NOT comfortable taking apart.

849
00:57:21,214 --> 00:57:32,148
Speaker 1: So now I gotta wait for the building to Decide they get it safe enough to just replace our dishwasher probably because it's probably cheaper to just replace it than to try to Replace the impeller that's buried in there somewhere.

850
00:57:33,592 --> 00:57:39,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually that's what happens a lot especially in a big building Like if I go down in the basement of my like ten more dishwashers down there.

851
00:57:40,046 --> 00:57:41,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've got dishwashers.

852
00:57:41,271 --> 00:57:42,018
Speaker 0: They got fridges.

853
00:57:42,098 --> 00:57:44,835
Speaker 0: They got each, you know P-tach units.

854
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:47,606
Speaker 0: they get all every unit every appliance in an apartment.

855
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:48,770
Speaker 0: They have several extras.

856
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:52,810
Speaker 0: So if one breaks, they're just gonna do a swap and then fix them elsewhere.

857
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:57,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they're gonna fix them at all as opposed to just buy more one, you know.

858
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:09,496
Speaker 1: but the cool thing about dishwashers at least like as a kitchen appliance is I Think like I think the fridge is the most important one because the idea of storing food for long periods of time is made Civilization happen to it.

859
00:58:09,537 --> 00:58:11,224
Speaker 0: You can go without the stove right.

860
00:58:11,244 --> 00:58:13,492
Speaker 0: you can go without the dishwasher Right.

861
00:58:13,773 --> 00:58:14,636
Speaker 0: you go and get out.

862
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,520
Speaker 0: the fridge is hard.

863
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,527
Speaker 1: Yep, like that's a different life.

864
00:58:17,988 --> 00:58:19,355
Speaker 0: It's like, okay I don't have a stove.

865
00:58:19,435 --> 00:58:20,521
Speaker 0: I could buy a hot plate.

866
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,130
Speaker 0: I could not cook food.

867
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,058
Speaker 0: I could just eat not cooked food.

868
00:58:24,078 --> 00:58:24,922
Speaker 0: I could make salads.

869
00:58:24,962 --> 00:58:26,690
Speaker 0: You can still have food without fire.

870
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:29,843
Speaker 1: Also, I have a toaster and all these other things like a microwave.

871
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:32,752
Speaker 1: There's a lot of ways around that problem Right.

872
00:58:32,973 --> 00:58:34,078
Speaker 0: There is dishwasher.

873
00:58:34,138 --> 00:58:34,278
Speaker 0: Okay.

874
00:58:34,298 --> 00:58:35,504
Speaker 0: I'll wash all my dishes by hand.

875
00:58:35,544 --> 00:58:36,066
Speaker 0: people do it.

876
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:36,910
Speaker 0: I did it.

877
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,096
Speaker 1: I never want to do it again.

878
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:40,490
Speaker 0: This is severely disruptive to my life right now.

879
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:45,910
Speaker 0: No fridge means you could only eat food that doesn't need to be chilled or frozen.

880
00:58:46,071 --> 00:58:49,365
Speaker 0: Yep, and that's not a lot of food eating cereal.

881
00:58:49,546 --> 00:58:52,057
Speaker 0: Yeah Fresh fruit bread.

882
00:58:52,077 --> 00:58:55,594
Speaker 0: you can't bake a bread, but you can buy a root vegetables It doesn't need.

883
00:58:55,775 --> 00:58:58,070
Speaker 0: giving a lot of like potatoes needs to go in the fridge.

884
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:01,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can buy a carrot and eat it immediately keep it for a while.

885
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:02,950
Speaker 1: Actually, I learned recently that you're better.

886
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:05,969
Speaker 1: There's a lot of those vegetables unless you're gonna store them for a long time.

887
00:59:06,451 --> 00:59:12,450
Speaker 1: If you're starting for a moderate amount of time refrigerating them is just going to make them worse and may even decrease their longevity.

888
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,386
Speaker 0: Yeah, no I mean my rule is basically if they keep it in the fridge at the grocery goes in the fridge.

889
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:21,266
Speaker 0: if they it's like a Tomato right a tomato in the groceries.

890
00:59:21,326 --> 00:59:21,670
Speaker 0: It's in a pile.

891
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,062
Speaker 1: You don't put tomatoes in the fridge unless you're gonna turn like you or something.

892
00:59:25,624 --> 00:59:27,149
Speaker 0: I do after I cut into.

893
00:59:27,169 --> 00:59:28,376
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Yeah, but that is not.

894
00:59:28,397 --> 00:59:30,370
Speaker 1: I'll say maybe it is just tomato.

895
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:31,953
Speaker 1: It's not a.

896
00:59:32,074 --> 00:59:40,004
Speaker 0: if I got half a tomato half a tomato goes in the fridge But a whole tomato that just sits out just like it does put in the fridge It'll taste worse for reasons.

897
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:55,710
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into Right, but The dishwasher because fridges I just assume work like if I have no fridge, I have no civilization like radical response to not having a fridge but Dishwasher, you know, we talked about this when we first moved to the city.

898
00:59:55,770 --> 01:00:06,490
Speaker 1: So back in 2009, we both assumed that having a dishwasher would make our lives better But we didn't quite grok how much of a difference having a dishwasher makes it.

899
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:13,830
Speaker 1: I did once I started doing dishes in the dishwasher when we moved here because it'd been a long time since I had had a dishwasher.

900
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:16,897
Speaker 1: We didn't have one in colony.

901
01:00:18,203 --> 01:00:19,630
Speaker 1: no, those are dark days.

902
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:27,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think one thing about dishwashers in particular Is that a lot of people like to rinse their dishes before they go.

903
01:00:27,282 --> 01:00:30,701
Speaker 1: my manual specifically says don't rinse your dishes Like it has a line.

904
01:00:30,721 --> 01:00:36,140
Speaker 0: It's not rinse them Obviously if you've got like some fucking bones on there, right?

905
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,090
Speaker 0: It's a big big stuff like an entire chicken wing.

906
01:00:39,191 --> 01:00:40,518
Speaker 1: Like yeah rinse that off, right?

907
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,650
Speaker 0: You got to put that in the trash, right?

908
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,703
Speaker 0: So you can scrape the plate right to get the big stuff.

909
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:47,470
Speaker 0: Don't put a napkin in the dish, right?

910
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:54,185
Speaker 0: Stuff that's big enough to go in the trash should go in the trash But then you don't need to rinse the dish before it goes in the dishwasher.

911
01:00:54,206 --> 01:00:55,230
Speaker 0: What do you think a dishwasher does?

912
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:56,376
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's washing.

913
01:00:56,397 --> 01:00:58,049
Speaker 1: the crazy thing is kept telling me.

914
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:05,356
Speaker 1: Old dishwashers would handle that stuff but newer dishwashers like are there for reasons artists like they're not as capable That?

915
01:01:05,437 --> 01:01:06,910
Speaker 1: I've heard the opposite story.

916
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:10,006
Speaker 0: The opposite story is what I heard which I still don't know.

917
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:10,690
Speaker 0: if this is true.

918
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:19,797
Speaker 0: the story I heard is that dishwashers used to suck and you used to have to rinse things off a little bit because Otherwise the dishwasher wouldn't clean it all the way.

919
01:01:20,279 --> 01:01:23,168
Speaker 0: and modern dishwashers don't suck and can clean.

920
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:28,565
Speaker 1: a very dirty Grandma dishwasher held a ton of dishes was oldest crap.

921
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:32,198
Speaker 0: people are used to Right having to rinse therefore.

922
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,190
Speaker 0: They still do it even though you don't have an alternative hypothesis.

923
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,090
Speaker 1: I think I have an explanation for all this annotated not matching up.

924
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:48,256
Speaker 1: I think the problem is most people load their dishwashers incorrectly and then wonder why the two bowls that are stuck together The inside of the bowl that was stuck didn't get washed.

925
01:01:48,597 --> 01:01:49,860
Speaker 1: I think that's what happens.

926
01:01:51,043 --> 01:01:56,633
Speaker 0: I Correct That's also true.

927
01:01:56,714 --> 01:01:59,504
Speaker 0: I'm aware that there is a correct and incorrect way to load the dishwasher.

928
01:01:59,544 --> 01:02:06,467
Speaker 0: However, I will often Lazily load it look at it and say yeah, that's overloaded or loaded incorrectly.

929
01:02:06,568 --> 01:02:13,576
Speaker 0: not care Yeah, I mean run it anyway, and then when the bowl comes out and it's still half dirty I'm like, yep, that's what I expected.

930
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:16,586
Speaker 0: and then I and then and then I wash the other half of the least.

931
01:02:16,606 --> 01:02:17,570
Speaker 1: you weren't surprised?

932
01:02:18,792 --> 01:02:20,161
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I'm never surprised.

933
01:02:20,261 --> 01:02:23,596
Speaker 0: when something comes out It's like put too much.

934
01:02:23,676 --> 01:02:25,988
Speaker 1: It's like if my computer like crashes and I'm like, huh?

935
01:02:27,351 --> 01:02:39,530
Speaker 1: Well, I'll just power it back on first like I don't investigate further and then if it doesn't post I'll just look at it for a minute and I'll usually just power it off and power back on at least one more time to see if anything is more like.

936
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:48,061
Speaker 0: It's more like there was that time where I tried to downgrade the BIOS And it's like if it didn't reboot I'd be like, all right.

937
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:48,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

938
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:48,863
Speaker 0: Yeah.

939
01:02:48,883 --> 01:02:59,925
Speaker 1: Yeah been there All right a dodgy hard drive for my old computer and I was like What if it'll work in the new computer it turn the computer on didn't post like that.

940
01:02:59,965 --> 01:03:02,012
Speaker 1: if I just unplug that one drive It'll boot again.

941
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:03,376
Speaker 1: plug the unplug that drive.

942
01:03:03,437 --> 01:03:07,549
Speaker 1: it posted and I just I just I kind of expected that and I went with it.

943
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:13,790
Speaker 1: Yep But I've seen people people we know like visiting people's houses.

944
01:03:13,951 --> 01:03:28,010
Speaker 1: I've seen them do things like put a plate or a bowl Over that part of the middle where the arms gonna come up to wash and not understand the number one thing I never do no matter how poorly Intentionally poorly I overload the dishwasher with too many dishes.

945
01:03:28,411 --> 01:03:32,483
Speaker 0: I make sure that both spin ease are free to spin without.

946
01:03:32,764 --> 01:03:34,590
Speaker 1: I spin every time before I run it.

947
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:40,949
Speaker 1: I spin the top one to make sure it's not gonna bump anything and then the bottom I just make sure there's that column of free space.

948
01:03:42,231 --> 01:03:43,777
Speaker 1: Yep, so the arm can get off.

949
01:03:43,797 --> 01:03:47,350
Speaker 0: that arm is the two spin ease can't spin then you're nothing's getting.

950
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:52,130
Speaker 1: I think the other thing I can say why did you even write looked up some pictures of old dishwashers versus new dishwashers?

951
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:59,710
Speaker 1: and one thing I noticed Older dishwashers have a lot more density of how many plates and things you can put in them for a same amount of space.

952
01:04:00,452 --> 01:04:07,190
Speaker 0: The density is is not really a problem as long as there's enough space around each dish so that its surfaces are open to come.

953
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:12,410
Speaker 1: But I think that density means that you have to load it a particular way or you'll cause problems.

954
01:04:12,752 --> 01:04:15,890
Speaker 1: But with modern dishwashers, there's a lot more space between things.

955
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:19,330
Speaker 1: So even if you kind of just throw stuff in it'll probably just work fine.

956
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:21,234
Speaker 1: I feel like that's also a factor.

957
01:04:21,535 --> 01:04:23,219
Speaker 1: another user experience problem.

958
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:23,740
Speaker 1: Shall we say?

959
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:29,275
Speaker 0: Yeah Much longer do.

960
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:31,869

969
01:05:19,051 --> 01:05:24,050
