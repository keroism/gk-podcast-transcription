1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,798
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, February 26th.

2
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,082
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:13,904
Speaker 1: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:15,549
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:21,030
Speaker 0: Tonight we bring you the lost episode of Geek Nights as we review tickets to ride.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,217
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,668
Speaker 0: Well, tonight's episode is a little special.

8
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:38,118
Speaker 0: You might have remembered that right before Katsucon we did a show that was actually just hypnotoed for 20 minutes.

9
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:44,860
Speaker 0: So we pulled it down and I put it back up, but Libsyn decided to cache it for like a week straight.

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:52,080
Speaker 0: So there was no point at which I could upload and allow everyone to actually download the real episode.

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,514
Speaker 0: Now luckily it wasn't a full episode anyway.

12
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:55,300
Speaker 0: It was just a special.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,760
Speaker 0: You know, we talked about ticket to ride a board game, but most of you didn't hear that episode because I eventually just pulled it down entirely and flushed out the Libsyn.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically we made an episode of Geek Nights.

15
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,773
Speaker 1: We tried to upload it.

16
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:08,676
Speaker 1: Rem screwed up.

17
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:09,920
Speaker 1: It failed epically.

18
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,840
Speaker 1: He just deleted the episode and took it off the internet.

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,848
Speaker 1: It's like it never happened.

20
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:15,440
Speaker 0: Because there was no other way to fix it.

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,428
Speaker 0: So some of you have listened to this, most of you have not.

22
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,295
Speaker 1: So now we're gonna put it back up.

23
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:24,440
Speaker 0: By the power of magic and gray skull, I bring to you our episode on ticket to ride.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:32,539
Speaker 0: But because that episode, you know, getting ready for Katsucon was just a special anyway, we're gonna record some news and thing of the day right now.

25
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:34,428
Speaker 0: To kind of make up for that a little bit.

26
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:36,680
Speaker 1: And then I'll go back to playing Professor Layton.

27
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:37,824
Speaker 0: I don't know.

28
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:39,340
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go back to playing with my new laptop.

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.

30
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:41,828
Speaker 1: Probably what I would be doing if I was you.

31
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but in the news Scott can't make chili worth a goddamn.

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,064
Speaker 1: Hey, alright, first of all.

33
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:47,330
Speaker 0: That was some of the worst chili.

34
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:49,660
Speaker 1: That chili wasn't that, first of all wasn't that bad.

35
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:52,215
Speaker 1: It wasn't good, but it wasn't that bad.

36
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:52,899
Speaker 0: I gotta say this.

37
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,340
Speaker 0: I really like I try to be polite and I don't I don't want to lie to you though and say like oh it was okay.

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:07,155
Speaker 0: That was the most unsatisf- you basically just made tomato paste with large chunks of chicken interspersed throughout.

39
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:08,600
Speaker 1: Okay, first of all, right?

40
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:10,548
Speaker 1: I tried to cut up the chicken.

41
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:12,920
Speaker 0: I knew I had to cut the chicken up into like two pieces.

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,078
Speaker 0: I knew I had two giant pieces of chicken sitting in a pot of hot tomato paste.

43
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:20,120
Speaker 1: First of all, I knew I had to cut it small, right?

44
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:23,340
Speaker 1: But I thought it would shrink so I cut it slightly too large, right?

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,415
Speaker 0: Then on the direction- there were like eight pieces of chicken in there.

46
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:28,058
Speaker 1: No, there were.

47
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:28,580
Speaker 1: there were a lot.

48
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:31,071
Speaker 1: But there weren't enough.

49
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:33,765
Speaker 1: I should, for a second of all, I should have put in more chicken.

50
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:38,085
Speaker 1: Like I cut up the chicken and I looked at it and I said that's enough but I should have cut up one more.

51
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:44,106
Speaker 0: I think more importantly you should have put something other than tomato paste and beans.

52
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:45,330
Speaker 1: Alright, hold on, hold on.

53
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:50,224
Speaker 1: So then I'm reading the directions right on the package and That's your first mistake.

54
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:53,437
Speaker 1: It said for more tomato-y chili, and I said that's what I like.

55
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:54,099
Speaker 1: It said do this.

56
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:55,705
Speaker 1: I shouldn't have done that.

57
00:02:56,006 --> 00:03:00,180
Speaker 0: Well one, what you did is you took nice diced tomatoes, right?

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,572
Speaker 0: But because of the way you cooked them, you just turned them into tomato paste.

59
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:05,560
Speaker 0: You could have just used a can of tomato paste.

60
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,385
Speaker 1: Well, okay, here's the other thing, right?

61
00:03:07,827 --> 00:03:09,452
Speaker 1: So I'm cooking it, right?

62
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,580
Speaker 1: And you know, it was it was going alright.

63
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,903
Speaker 1: And then it said hey, if you want thicker chili add this flour and then add some water and I'm like, okay I will do that.

64
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:24,908
Speaker 1: So all you did was take the already too thick tomato paste because it wasn't thick when I added that but it was too thick after it.

65
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,159
Speaker 0: That's because you reduced it too much.

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,966
Speaker 1: There was definitely too much reduction.

67
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:30,920
Speaker 0: And also because you're supposed to have, I don't know, peppers.

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,945
Speaker 1: Okay, first of all, right?

69
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,417
Speaker 1: First of all, I gotta tell you the directions didn't say to add that.

70
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:38,624
Speaker 0: But second of all, Don't follow the directions.

71
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:44,080
Speaker 1: Second of all, I realized after I already had the stuff going on that I should have done that.

72
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,439
Speaker 1: But then it was too late.

73
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,173
Speaker 1: You got to do that first when you're like, you know, browning the or cooking the meats.

74
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:50,940
Speaker 0: Actually, you can just toss it in at any time.

75
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,608
Speaker 0: It'll be fine.

76
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,520
Speaker 1: No, it's no good.

77
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:57,014
Speaker 0: Having made many successful chilies, it is not hard to make chili.

78
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:58,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not hard.

79
00:03:58,098 --> 00:04:00,486
Speaker 1: But anyway, Well, it doesn't make you the chili.

80
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:03,716
Speaker 0: First of all, you presented evidence to the contrary of it not being hard.

81
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:04,740
Speaker 1: I made good chili before.

82
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:09,297
Speaker 0: This was like, the chili in the can is better.

83
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:09,760
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

84
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:12,540
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say this is a great chili.

85
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,482
Speaker 1: I can't lie to you.

86
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,849
Speaker 1: It wasn't as bad as you're saying it is.

87
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,954
Speaker 1: And next time it'll be awesome because I have learned.

88
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,940
Speaker 0: Do you want me as a man to lie to you and say yes, Scott?

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,988
Speaker 0: That was an okay chili.

90
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:22,700
Speaker 0: I don't feel bad for having eaten it.

91
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:27,840
Speaker 0: It did not entirely unsatisfied me to the point that I feel like I should eat a different dinner.

92
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:29,600
Speaker 1: It wasn't that bad.

93
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:32,428
Speaker 1: It was just a little bad.

94
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:35,778
Speaker 1: Anyway, speaking next time, I'm gonna make the awesomest chili.

95
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:36,360
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

96
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,982
Speaker 1: We'll see.

97
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:40,980
Speaker 1: Plus, I think that the the shotgun really is superior to that the other bag.

98
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:43,914
Speaker 0: You just you just spice chili.

99
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:44,839
Speaker 0: You don't need a bag.

100
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:45,903
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

101
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:46,987
Speaker 0: You just just make it.

102
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,520
Speaker 0: The bag of chili powder is just chili powder.

103
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,525
Speaker 1: No, there's more to it.

104
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:54,052
Speaker 0: Yeah, not much more.

105
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:54,413
Speaker 0: It's not.

106
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,900
Speaker 1: It's all about the number of alarms.

107
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,849
Speaker 0: And you can just kind of wing that.

108
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:58,854
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it.

109
00:04:58,874 --> 00:04:59,698
Speaker 1: Next time, it's gonna be...

110
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,502
Speaker 0: Ah, judge it.

111
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,820
Speaker 0: After what happened today, I think I feel I think I feel justified in fact worrying about it.

112
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:05,586
Speaker 1: What the hell?

113
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,338
Speaker 1: You think because?

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,217
Speaker 1: Zomom, I made I made a great chili last time.

115
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:12,679
Speaker 0: When was that?

116
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:14,044
Speaker 1: Weeks ago.

117
00:05:14,345 --> 00:05:15,107
Speaker 0: Weeks ago.

118
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:16,090
Speaker 0: Oh, was it?

119
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:17,675
Speaker 0: Was it really weeks ago?

120
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,040
Speaker 1: It was some number of weeks ago.

121
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,278
Speaker 0: Yes, a number of weeks ago.

122
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,087
Speaker 0: Probably a number greater than 50.

123
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:25,110
Speaker 1: No, not that many.

124
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:29,623
Speaker 0: Anyway, in other sad news, Gen Con.

125
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:31,390
Speaker 0: Now, there are two parts to this story.

126
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,724
Speaker 0: I'm sure a lot of you have heard rumors or seen some articles, but point the first.

127
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:36,828
Speaker 0: Gen Con.

128
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,093
Speaker 0: That venerable old...

129
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:40,562
Speaker 1: I feel like we talked about this already, but I'm not sure.

130
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:50,705
Speaker 0: That venerable old convention of people who like to play a role playing games and such at filed for bankruptcy for various reasons.

131
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:51,908
Speaker 0: Now, point the second.

132
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:54,113
Speaker 0: Actually, only one reason.

133
00:05:54,474 --> 00:05:56,459
Speaker 0: The fact that Lucasfilm is suing them.

134
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,645
Speaker 0: Now, the details...

135
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:02,390
Speaker 1: It's hard to get sued by Lucasfilm.

136
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,820
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, as all the bad things you can say about them, right?

137
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:07,467
Speaker 1: The only good thing.

138
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:09,200
Speaker 1: Well, there's some good things you can say about them, too.

139
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,240
Speaker 1: But for all the bad things you can say about Lucas and his empire is that he kind of lets people make Star Wars shit.

140
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,060
Speaker 1: So, you know, like he lets people make fan films and he lets people make fan arts and he, you know, he lets you go nuts with the Star Wars.

141
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Speaker 0: Well, a lot of people are really kind of rallying to Gen Con side at all those bastards.

142
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, he lets those people do their costumes at the conventions with their...

143
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:38,900
Speaker 0: But, I'm curious as to what actually happened because like any sort of lawsuits like this don't just suddenly spring up.

144
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you got to do something serious to get them to sue you.

145
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,860
Speaker 0: It's more that a company like this wouldn't just out of the blue file a lawsuit.

146
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:52,340
Speaker 0: There is obviously been some sort of ongoing dialogue between Gen Con and Lucasfilm.

147
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:57,520
Speaker 0: They were unable to resolve their differences and Lucasfilm having no other recourse has filed this.

148
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,580
Speaker 0: Now, the four complaints are very interesting.

149
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:08,520
Speaker 0: Number one is that Gen Con has failed to uphold his legal obligations in terms of financial reporting, accounting and payments to Lucasfilm.

150
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:18,000
Speaker 0: Now, this is mostly in regard to Celebration 4, which was a Star Wars convention run by Gen Con or something like that.

151
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,060
Speaker 1: So, they ran a Star Wars convention.

152
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,640
Speaker 1: Apparently, Gen Con is a convention running company and they were supposed to pay Lucasfilm for the right to run the Star Wars convention.

153
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,600
Speaker 0: It's more complicated than that, that you could read the full complaint if you want.

154
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,260
Speaker 0: But I didn't even care about Celebration 4.

155
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,080
Speaker 0: I barely even care about Gen Con anymore.

156
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,900
Speaker 1: You care about Gen Con even a little?

157
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,300
Speaker 0: I used to really want to go and as time went on, I cared less and less.

158
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,160
Speaker 0: I never cared.

159
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,765
Speaker 0: Why not?

160
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:44,879
Speaker 0: It's a big gaming con.

161
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,118
Speaker 1: There's better gaming cons.

162
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,999
Speaker 0: When was the last time you went to a gaming con?

163
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,694
Speaker 1: Too long ago.

164
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:50,966
Speaker 0: Point the second.

165
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,455
Speaker 0: Now, this one's extra interesting.

166
00:07:52,496 --> 00:07:53,180
Speaker 0: This is Lucasfilm.

167
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:53,890
Speaker 0: Going to PAX.

168
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:54,580
Speaker 1: PAX is all that matters.

169
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,440
Speaker 0: This is Lucasfilm twisting the dagger a little bit.

170
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,480
Speaker 0: Gen Con did not give auction proceeds to Make-A-Wish Foundation as they had agreed to.

171
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,500
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan of Make-A-Wish Foundation.

172
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:04,978
Speaker 0: Why not?

173
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:06,739
Speaker 0: Well, what do you have?

174
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,358
Speaker 0: What do you have against me?

175
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,100
Speaker 0: First, you make bad chili and now you malign the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

176
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:22,627
Speaker 1: Basically, Make-A-Wish Foundation, you know, I mean, you know, it's sort of hard and it's sort of it's very difficult to take a stand against a charitable organization that helps sick children.

177
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:24,040
Speaker 1: That's that's difficult.

178
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,300
Speaker 0: But Scott, I guess, is up to the challenge of harming sick children's dreams.

179
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,715
Speaker 1: No, but the Make-A-Wish Foundation gets a lot of money to pay.

180
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:32,477
Speaker 1: very like.

181
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:33,962
Speaker 1: most of what they do is like they.

182
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:38,059
Speaker 1: they'll very often, for example, get a famous person to visit a kid in the hospital.

183
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,820
Speaker 0: Now, do you know this just from the few news reports you see?

184
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,497
Speaker 0: Do you actually know about the Make-A-Wish organization and what they do on a day to day basis?

185
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,220
Speaker 1: No, I don't know what they do on a day to day basis.

186
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:55,058
Speaker 1: But I just think that, you know, if you're going to help sick children, you could spend the money on, you know, medicine instead of.

187
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,580
Speaker 0: Well, I guess we should get rid of Penny Arcade's charity because obviously it's just entertainment because that's because that actually helps.

188
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,840
Speaker 1: You're distracted from your pain when you play video games, this studies.

189
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:08,740
Speaker 0: And so getting to meet Michael Jackson doesn't distract you from your pain.

190
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,059
Speaker 1: No, it adds more pain.

191
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:11,359
Speaker 1: You just don't know it yet.

192
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:20,780
Speaker 0: OK, well, I guess Scott is entitled to his somewhat uninformed opinion on the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

193
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:22,140
Speaker 1: I'm not I'm not against them.

194
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,800
Speaker 1: It's not like Make-A-Wish Foundation is evil.

195
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,319
Speaker 1: I just think there are better charities.

196
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:26,559
Speaker 0: I don't know.

197
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,820
Speaker 0: Just you kind of went out of your way there to go after that.

198
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:34,140
Speaker 0: But the fact that that is an issue in this lawsuit, I find very interesting.

199
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:35,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, come on.

200
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,300
Speaker 1: Even if it's the Make-A-Wish Foundation, you know, it doesn't matter what charity is.

201
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,180
Speaker 1: It could be the Joe Bob charity.

202
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:46,819
Speaker 1: If you say you're going to have a charity auction and then you don't give the charity auction money to the charity, that is low.

203
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:48,880
Speaker 1: That is so low.

204
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,860
Speaker 0: Gen Con did not give Lucasfilm their share of the auction proceeds because apparently something must have happened.

205
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:01,500
Speaker 1: They probably were auctioning off goods donated by Lucasfilm, like sells or, you know, movie film or something.

206
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,134
Speaker 0: I like Adam IV.

207
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,400
Speaker 0: This is this is very much the lawyer part.

208
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,636
Speaker 0: Gen Con did all of this unjustly.

209
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:11,880
Speaker 1: OK, I don't know what that's supposed to mean.

210
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:26,580
Speaker 0: My guess, my take on this, because I've seen this happen with other conventions before, especially fan conventions are very often run by people who are not necessarily full of business acumen and may or may not actually just be banned.

211
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,060
Speaker 1: They're very unprofessional.

212
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:45,040
Speaker 0: I have this sneaking suspicion that what actually happened is that Jen, that the organization Gen Con that attempted to run Celebration for did not read fully the contract that they may have signed with Lucasfilm regarding whatever.

213
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:49,700
Speaker 0: And when confronted, were unable to cover their end of the bargain.

214
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,939
Speaker 1: That's a good guess as any.

215
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,399
Speaker 0: That is my guess.

216
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:53,318
Speaker 1: Makes sense to me.

217
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,080
Speaker 0: But regardless of all that, they claim that this is not like everyone who declares bankruptcy.

218
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,600
Speaker 0: This is not the end of Gen Con.

219
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:10,500
Speaker 0: This is simply a temporary measure to gain protection while they resort their finances, go with their more profitable venues and hopefully get out of bankruptcy.

220
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:18,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, actually, all their events are continuing to be scheduled and are planned to proceed.

221
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even so, I mean, that is the way bankruptcy is supposed to work.

222
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,859
Speaker 0: You're supposed to be able to get out of bankruptcy.

223
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:36,518
Speaker 1: I would like to see statistics just like overall, like, you know, companies and people like separately, like the percentage of people in companies going into bankruptcy and then how many of them get out.

224
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:45,199
Speaker 1: That would be very interesting to see, like, because I mean, technically, shouldn't you try to like raise the percentage of people getting out of bankruptcy, like as high as possible?

225
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:51,279
Speaker 1: I mean, if everyone who goes into bankruptcy stays bankrupt, then is bankruptcy really working as a law?

226
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:52,078
Speaker 1: Not so much.

227
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:53,517
Speaker 0: All right.

228
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,079
Speaker 0: So anyway, what do you got the news?

229
00:11:55,421 --> 00:12:00,176
Speaker 0: Because as much as I'd like to talk more in depth about this, I really don't care that much.

230
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,079
Speaker 1: No, I really don't care.

231
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,713
Speaker 1: OK, so by the commando, which we can talk about a whole lot, it's pretty much like the only non we.

232
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,818
Speaker 1: Well, actually, it's coming to the PC.

233
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:14,640
Speaker 1: So, you know, I guess it doesn't count, but it's one of the video games we can talk about.

234
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,017
Speaker 1: that's on the systems we don't have.

235
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:23,964
Speaker 1: Anyway, by the commando, rearmed, not the 3D by the commando remake, but the remake of the original.

236
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:31,760
Speaker 0: by the commando with newer graphics and more modern control, which I am much more looking forward to than the actual bionic commando that is coming out.

237
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:32,116
Speaker 1: Right.

238
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,014
Speaker 1: By the commando, rearmed is coming out to the PS3, the 360 and the PC.

239
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:37,659
Speaker 1: Right.

240
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,660
Speaker 1: However, it is going to use the PS3's remote play feature.

241
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:52,859
Speaker 1: If you are not familiar with this remote play feature, basically what this means is let's say you go and you buy bionic commando rearmed for the PS3.

242
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,160
Speaker 1: You sit down at your PS3 in front of your HDTV and you play bionic commando rearmed.

243
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,100
Speaker 1: But now you want to go lay in bed and play bionic commando rearmed.

244
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,039
Speaker 1: You get your PSP, you go lay in bed and you're playing bionic commando rearmed because your PS3 sends the game to the PSP.

245
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:13,279
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

246
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:24,800
Speaker 1: Now, this is significant because number one, this is one of the first games and probably the first non Sony game to do this, to take take advantage of this feature.

247
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:31,920
Speaker 1: Two, this feature is actually being used and it works and it's useful and cool.

248
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:39,462
Speaker 1: And three, the DS, which is probably like a billion times more potential for a feature like this.

249
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:44,560
Speaker 1: that is definitely possible that it's technologically definitely possible.

250
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,483
Speaker 1: One hundred percent.

251
00:13:45,503 --> 00:13:50,744
Speaker 1: Nintendo hasn't done shit, of course, again, because Nintendo doesn't have to like.

252
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:54,060
Speaker 0: Nintendo has always been able to do throughout almost the entirety of their existence.

253
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:57,980
Speaker 0: They can just laugh all the way to the bank because they're making so much money.

254
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:02,780
Speaker 0: They could just cease operations and have already made money off of all their products out there.

255
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have the high potential that is unfulfilled.

256
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,540
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, you know, they're high potential that is unfulfilled.

257
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,251
Speaker 1: OK, you know, it's it's still.

258
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,500
Speaker 1: they got good stuff going on.

259
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,778
Speaker 1: I mean, the Smash Brothers alone.

260
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,638
Speaker 1: I mean, come on.

261
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:13,912
Speaker 1: Right.

262
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:25,795
Speaker 1: But Sony, on the other hand, you know, even though they sort of got off to a really bad start, you know, and I still probably would never buy a PS3, the PSP is starting to look OK.

263
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:40,120
Speaker 1: You know, the pad upons not looking as good as it did when it was not because Tyco, if any arcade maligned it slightly and briefly after a a short encounter with it, his word me carries a lot of weight.

264
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:40,654
Speaker 1: What can you know?

265
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:40,820
Speaker 0: what?

266
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,240
Speaker 0: As much as I like gave in Tyco and agree with most of what they say until Yahtzee weighs in, I got nothing.

267
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:56,020
Speaker 0: Man, if Yahtzee weighs in on Pat upon, that'd be awesome because I to this day, I've never found a single statement I can disagree with regarding video games that has come forth from that man's mouth.

268
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,720
Speaker 1: I'm not saying I'm not saying that I will agree 100 percent that Yahtzee, his word carries like 10 times the weight of Tyco's word.

269
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,319
Speaker 1: Yet Tyco's word, it is not an empty word.

270
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:13,080
Speaker 1: You know, that's you know, anyway, point is PS3, PSP is a little bit going on there.

271
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:13,586
Speaker 0: Yeah.

272
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:15,400
Speaker 0: Well, it is amazing.

273
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,620
Speaker 1: It's a little bit of command.

274
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,580
Speaker 0: It's the first time there's ever been a second place.

275
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:19,259
Speaker 0: Yeah.

276
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:25,045
Speaker 0: And the fact that it's continuing to be a strong second place hopefully will light a fire under Nintendo someday.

277
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:29,430
Speaker 1: to they actually seem to be fulfilling the potential that they have.

278
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,558
Speaker 1: Their potential is less.

279
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,519
Speaker 1: But the fact that they fulfill it, it's like Nintendo has a big like a gallon jug and Sony has a half gallon jug.

280
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,040
Speaker 1: But Nintendo's gallon jug only has a quart of liquid in it.

281
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,460
Speaker 1: But Sony's half gallon jug is overflowing.

282
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:48,540
Speaker 0: Man, I'd rather have a gallon of Sony's liquid than that chili.

283
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:50,080
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

284
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,519
Speaker 1: Leave my chili.

285
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,820
Speaker 0: Your chili wasn't that good.

286
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,217
Speaker 0: I got it.

287
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:52,885
Speaker 0: I can't.

288
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:54,159
Speaker 0: I can't let it slide.

289
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,980
Speaker 1: It definitely wasn't that good, but it wasn't like horrible poison.

290
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:01,519
Speaker 0: We'll get a neutral opinion later.

291
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,765
Speaker 1: It was a. it was an.

292
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:06,460
Speaker 1: actually next time it'll be a chili.

293
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:07,576
Speaker 1: I promise.

294
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,680
Speaker 0: A bunch of my coworkers are buying PS3 is a lot of people are buying them now just because it's the cheapest Blu-ray player on the market.

295
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:13,951
Speaker 1: Yeah.

296
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,280
Speaker 0: I mean, the the PS2 run that won that slap fight.

297
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:25,149
Speaker 1: Well, the PS2 was incredibly popular and it exploded mostly because, you know, at the time DVD had already won.

298
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:30,100
Speaker 1: DVD was something people already were buying into and everyone wanted a player, but players are still expensive.

299
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:33,420
Speaker 1: And the PS2 came out and was the cheapest DVD player.

300
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,760
Speaker 1: So people said, hey, it's a DVD player and a PS2 can't beat that.

301
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:39,180
Speaker 1: And then the PS2 exploded.

302
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:41,200
Speaker 1: But now everyone has a DVD player.

303
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:41,938
Speaker 1: They're 40 bucks.

304
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,120
Speaker 1: So Sony said, hey, we can do the same thing with Blu-ray.

305
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:57,180
Speaker 1: And, you know, the problem was is it was a little different situation because first of all, there was a competitor to the Blu-ray and Blu-ray and HD DVD together are not commanding nearly the market share the DVD.

306
00:16:57,401 --> 00:17:01,060
Speaker 1: And when the PS2 came out, DVD had already been a success.

307
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,500
Speaker 1: It was already poised to take over the market.

308
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,499
Speaker 1: You were already in a situation where people wanted DVDs.

309
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,763
Speaker 1: They were stuck with.

310
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:11,219
Speaker 1: there was still VHS is in the stores because people still had VCRs.

311
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:18,259
Speaker 1: But the stores were, you know, it was at like the perfect moment when DVDs were exploding onto the scene.

312
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:26,880
Speaker 1: This was like they tried to force the explosion instead of waiting, you know, for the bomb to go off and then sort of riding the explosion to get a double jump.

313
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:30,780
Speaker 1: They sort of like put the bomb down and hope that it would explode.

314
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,479
Speaker 1: And it still hasn't exploded yet.

315
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:44,049
Speaker 0: But anyway, we'll get some things the day out and then we'll air that last episode of Geek Nights.

316
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:55,470
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day, this is real short, real sweet video of the guy who wrote the portal song is still alive, performing it in rock band with some other people who are moderately famous.

317
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:58,090
Speaker 0: And the performance is pretty ass.

318
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,290
Speaker 0: I got to say the video is not that great.

319
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:16,790
Speaker 0: All I want to point out is that it's amazing the kind of currency that the still alive song and portal pull, because you can have like you could go to a convention, a gaming con and just go up on stage and just start reciting random lyrics from that song.

320
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,109
Speaker 0: And the crowd would be cheering and screaming.

321
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:18,907
Speaker 1: Yeah.

322
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,610
Speaker 1: I mean, this is such an example of that.

323
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:27,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good song, you know, but people are going way crazier over it that I don't feel it that strongly.

324
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,410
Speaker 0: That's because portal was that way.

325
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:30,849
Speaker 0: People are still making cake jokes.

326
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,470
Speaker 1: It's a I know people just like at Kasukan.

327
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,849
Speaker 1: I was sick most of the time.

328
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,950
Speaker 1: Yet people were yelling, you know, cake is a lie.

329
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,650
Speaker 1: Cake is a lie.

330
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,190
Speaker 1: And I'm like, it's not funny.

331
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,033
Speaker 1: It doesn't.

332
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:43,010
Speaker 1: it's not a social currency.

333
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,990
Speaker 0: People are buying it and saying, look, I am a fan of that thing.

334
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:47,870
Speaker 0: Check it out.

335
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:51,450
Speaker 1: I wore a portal shirt one day because I am a fan of that thing.

336
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,850
Speaker 0: But I used to be that way.

337
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:55,310
Speaker 0: Don't pretend you're beyond that.

338
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,670
Speaker 0: There was a time when we would walk around.

339
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,286
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I'm not.

340
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,709
Speaker 1: I'm not beyond that.

341
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,430
Speaker 1: It's just this particular one.

342
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,490
Speaker 1: The yelling of how is this different than yelling Leroy?

343
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,090
Speaker 1: It's not any different.

344
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,349
Speaker 1: It's just this particular one doesn't do it for me.

345
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:08,229
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

346
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,447
Speaker 0: But Leroy still does.

347
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,590
Speaker 1: Oh, Leroy Jenkins.

348
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,549
Speaker 1: Even though I hate World of Warcraft portal, which I love, but the meme no good.

349
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:16,048
Speaker 1: World of Warcraft.

350
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,026
Speaker 1: I hate the meme.

351
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:18,106
Speaker 1: Two thumbs up.

352
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:18,869
Speaker 0: All right.

353
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,046
Speaker 0: So anyway, what do you got for me?

354
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:23,910
Speaker 1: So these guys, they're crazy Japanese people, of course.

355
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:38,510
Speaker 1: They took Final Fantasy 7 and they made pretty much the whole game, not on the SNES, not on, you know, I guess it was originally on the PlayStation, but on the Atari 7800.

356
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,789
Speaker 1: I wish.

357
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:48,190
Speaker 1: No, on the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Famicom, the original Famicom Final Fantasy 7, it basically make the whole game pretty much the whole game.

358
00:19:48,310 --> 00:20:16,030
Speaker 1: I mean, there's some characters missing and some side stuff missing, but they've pretty much made all of the major plot, all of the major characters, you know, all the, you know, major scenes, all the major places, you know, the whole game, the bad guys from beginning to end, the most of the music, you know, it's as good as it could be done on the NES, you know, and it's, it's Final Fantasy 7 and it's on the final.

359
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:22,290
Speaker 0: I'll warn you, as cool as this is, the video is not very entertaining to watch because it's very slow and full of a lot of combat.

360
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,430
Speaker 1: Well, there's a lot of other videos and, you know, screenshots and all sorts of things.

361
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,130
Speaker 1: I'll use a ROM.

362
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,569
Speaker 1: You can download the ROM and play it yourself if you really want to.

363
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,830
Speaker 1: But, you know, this is on every gaming website.

364
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:45,350
Speaker 1: You know, I just had to talk about it just because it's so, you know, they took a game, you know, like a 3D game from, you know, one time period and they ported the game to an older engine.

365
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:54,590
Speaker 1: It's kind of a, it's quite a feat and it's definitely, even if it's not worth playing, you know, cause it isn't Japanese, I'm sure there'll be an English translation eventually.

366
00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:00,449
Speaker 0: But hey, I played a good chunk of Final Fantasies 2 and 3, not in Japanese because I didn't have the right character.

367
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:01,989
Speaker 1: But with bad, bad translations.

368
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:13,990
Speaker 0: No, but, well, it was translated up until I walked into the first town and talked to some ninja and the ninja said gobbledy googity gobbledy sword sword gobbledy orb sword.

369
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:15,029
Speaker 1: Awesome.

370
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:16,289
Speaker 0: And I said, fuck.

371
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:18,070
Speaker 0: And I kept playing for a while.

372
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:22,328
Speaker 0: I kept playing that game for a while before I gave up because not knowing what people say makes Final Fantasy hard.

373
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:23,349
Speaker 1: Real hard.

374
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,141
Speaker 1: Yeah.

375
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:25,189
Speaker 1: What do I do?

376
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,108
Speaker 1: Where do I go next?

377
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,907
Speaker 0: Especially since that game had a talk to people to get the keywords to ask other people to learn other things.

378
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:32,758
Speaker 1: Yeah.

379
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:34,830
Speaker 1: But anyway, you should check this out.

380
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:35,709
Speaker 1: It's pretty amazing.

381
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,590
Speaker 1: It's everywhere on the internet, whatever.

382
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:43,470
Speaker 0: So thus, without further ado, I present to you the lost episode of Geek Nights, where we review Ticket to Ride.

383
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,850
Speaker 0: I don't remember what else we say.

384
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,050
Speaker 0: I don't remember anything from this episode.

385
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:47,929
Speaker 0: I hope you like it.

386
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:51,910
Speaker 0: For the uninitiated, you might wonder, how come there is no music right now?

387
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,150
Speaker 0: How come Rim's just talking?

388
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,230
Speaker 0: That means it's time.

389
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,170
Speaker 0: It's another Geek Nights special.

390
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,650
Speaker 1: I love how we use the word special and special is supposed to be a good thing.

391
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,310
Speaker 1: It's a positive word, special.

392
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,370
Speaker 1: But really, a special episode is where we're lazy and the episode sucks and doesn't have a news or thing of the day or anything.

393
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,650
Speaker 0: Special means for whatever reason, we're tired or busy or preparing for Katsu-kan.

394
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,810
Speaker 0: So as a result, we don't put together a whole show.

395
00:22:15,952 --> 00:22:16,890
Speaker 0: We kind of just do something.

396
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:24,650
Speaker 0: If this is your first experience with Geek Nights, I highly recommend you listen to any other episode that does not include the word special in the title.

397
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,050
Speaker 1: Well, this isn't a bad episode.

398
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:29,910
Speaker 1: It's just that it's not going to familiarize you with the format.

399
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,349
Speaker 0: It is not representative of what Geek Nights is.

400
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:38,265
Speaker 0: Much like when I listened to another podcast a long time ago and I remember telling Scott who would recommend it to me, "Man, that thing

401
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:38,730
Speaker 0: sucked.".

402
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:44,950
Speaker 0: And we eventually discovered that I listened to the one random episode that happened to have had two guest hosts.

403
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:45,074
Speaker 0: Yeah.

404
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:53,850
Speaker 1: Is it sort of like, imagine if you meet someone for the first time, they make their first impression on you when they're completely plastered.

405
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:54,807
Speaker 1: That's what this is.

406
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:59,089
Speaker 0: That's kind of like when I met Daryl Surratt the first time.

407
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,369
Speaker 1: Something like that.

408
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:01,829
Speaker 1: All right.

409
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:07,170
Speaker 1: So Katsu-kan that we're preparing for is this weekend as in February what?

410
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:10,228
Speaker 0: In the Omnishorm Hotel in Washington, D.C.

411
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:14,822
Speaker 0: on the weekend of Friday, February 15th through Sunday, February 17th.

412
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:19,424
Speaker 0: Yes.

413
00:23:20,236 --> 00:23:20,889
Speaker 1: Not any other year.

414
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,310
Speaker 1: I don't know what you could be listening to this in like 2010.

415
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,250
Speaker 1: How far do I know, right?

416
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,850
Speaker 0: But yeah, we are going to be there doing crazy amounts of stuff.

417
00:23:28,612 --> 00:23:31,290
Speaker 0: If you don't like anime, cause this isn't anime-con nominally, but one.

418
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,930
Speaker 0: Now, if you're a geek, Katsu-kan is absolutely awesome.

419
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:38,970
Speaker 1: Because, first of all, other anime-cons, the gaming room, not so good.

420
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,350
Speaker 1: Katsu-kan, go just for the video game room.

421
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,924
Speaker 1: It's worth it.

422
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,129
Speaker 0: Especially, remember, the video game room at Katsu-kan is actually two rooms.

423
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,630
Speaker 0: One room is like any other con's video game room, except that it's run awesomely.

424
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,029
Speaker 0: And the other room is our room.

425
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,871
Speaker 0: By our room, I mean at the front of the room is us playing music and chilling with our Atari 7800.

426
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:03,210
Speaker 1: Oh, no, he's busting out the kaboom.

427
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:03,909
Speaker 0: The rest.

428
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,089
Speaker 1: I'm gonna bust out the pitfall.

429
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,260
Speaker 0: The rest of the room is, let's see, these are arcade cabinets for games like, I don't know.

430
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:12,067
Speaker 1: Rampart.

431
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:13,486
Speaker 0: Rampart.

432
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,990
Speaker 0: Street Fighter 1.

433
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,730
Speaker 1: Root Beer Tapper.

434
00:24:17,193 --> 00:24:17,890
Speaker 0: Oh, Root Beer Tapper.

435
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,323
Speaker 0: Dig Dug.

436
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,770
Speaker 0: Root Beer Tapper is the best fucking- Circus Tamer.

437
00:24:21,153 --> 00:24:21,467
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

438
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,110
Speaker 1: Rampart.

439
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:23,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

440
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:26,070
Speaker 1: Rampart again.

441
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:32,208
Speaker 0: Seriously, Katsu-kan is like the esteemed convention for esteemed gentlemen who happen to be geeks.

442
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:35,069
Speaker 0: And if you like video games, Katsu-kan is going to be up your alley.

443
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:35,946
Speaker 1: Rampart.

444
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:37,530
Speaker 0: But anyway.

445
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,530
Speaker 1: How many times do we have to say Rampart do you think before it's funny again?

446
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,530
Speaker 0: We've done a show on Rampart.

447
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:42,188
Speaker 1: Oh, did we?

448
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:43,208
Speaker 0: We did, didn't we?

449
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:43,967
Speaker 0: We better have.

450
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,409
Speaker 0: Surround castle to stay alive, Jinx.

451
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:48,283
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

452
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,749
Speaker 1: Good job, Blue Commander.

453
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,550
Speaker 0: Red Commander needs food badly.

454
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,485
Speaker 0: Wrong game.

455
00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,910
Speaker 1: They might have the gauntlet working this year.

456
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,950
Speaker 0: Run, run, Red Commander, run.

457
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:03,170
Speaker 1: They had a gauntlet last year.

458
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,088
Speaker 1: Wasn't working too well.

459
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,350
Speaker 0: As in it wasn't working.

460
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,250
Speaker 0: You know what they should have?

461
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,409
Speaker 0: I want the old D&D game.

462
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,990
Speaker 1: Oh, the walk sideways one.

463
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:15,849
Speaker 1: And if that was on free play, oh my God, I'd be clericking it up using my- Sticks to snakes.

464
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:16,590
Speaker 1: Sticks to snakes.

465
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:17,209
Speaker 0: Nothing but.

466
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:20,810
Speaker 1: Oh, and also, of course, my aww, turn on dead.

467
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:24,649
Speaker 0: You know that aww I think is the same aww from Saab.

468
00:25:25,512 --> 00:25:28,290
Speaker 1: Oh, they brought that or the Ninja Turtles or the Simpsons.

469
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:37,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I- All four of those games, the D&D one, the Simpsons, the X-Men, and the Ninja Turtles lined up with free play.

470
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,950
Speaker 1: I would not move from that spot.

471
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,710
Speaker 1: Like Scott, it's time to do this panel and beat the Ninja Turtles.

472
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,850
Speaker 0: Main event's the late show.

473
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,509
Speaker 0: You're interviewing- Eh, fuck it, whatever.

474
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,389
Speaker 1: Someone else- Ninja Turtles, man.

475
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:47,968
Speaker 1: Ninja Turtles.

476
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,609
Speaker 0: All right.

477
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,730
Speaker 0: Right, so Katsu-Kan.

478
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,590
Speaker 0: As a result, we totally copped out tonight.

479
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,550
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about a board game real quick.

480
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,768
Speaker 0: There's not a lot to say about it.

481
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,069
Speaker 0: Ticket to ride.

482
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,668
Speaker 1: All right.

483
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,107
Speaker 0: It's fun.

484
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:07,110
Speaker 1: Ticket to ride is this game that sort of busted out and became really popular a year or so ago, maybe two years ago, and I can't even keep track anymore.

485
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:21,410
Speaker 1: The reason it busted out and so popular is because it has many game mechanics that basically they make the game really fun, and they could be used to make the game really good, and in some ways they are, but in some ways they aren't.

486
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, think of it this way.

487
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:38,870
Speaker 0: The real secret behind this game's success is that it's so incredibly simple to learn, incredibly accessible, and it's a train game, but before you go, "Ah," and stop listening and shoot yourself, there are, in fact, three different kinds of train game in the world.

488
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,149
Speaker 1: Whoa, three now.

489
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:53,310
Speaker 0: Now, Ticket to Ride is the special last kind I'm going to talk about, but when most people think of train games, they think of games that involve wax paper, crease pencils, crayons, and crying.

490
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,750
Speaker 0: Those games require a special kind of person to play.

491
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,730
Speaker 1: They do, indeed.

492
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,850
Speaker 0: Then there's games like Railroad Tycoon or Age of Steam.

493
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,110
Speaker 0: I was about to say if you're a little-- The masochistic Railroad Tycoon.

494
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:13,970
Speaker 0: Probably the only game I've ever played in my life that has not a single catch-up mechanism whatsoever, and in fact, kicks you out if you're not doing well enough.

495
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:15,829
Speaker 1: We should learn how to play it.

496
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:17,388
Speaker 0: I did learn how to play it.

497
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,189
Speaker 1: I'm lost.

498
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,550
Speaker 1: Learn how to play it well.

499
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,420
Speaker 1: All right.

500
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:26,968
Speaker 0: So this is a special third kind of game, and we're starting to see more of these every now and then.

501
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,067
Speaker 0: They're starting to creep in.

502
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,249
Speaker 1: Third in Texas is very similar, mechanic-wise.

503
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,090
Speaker 0: Yes, but basically, it's not really a train game.

504
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:35,790
Speaker 0: It looks like a train game.

505
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,090
Speaker 0: It's themed like a train game.

506
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,030
Speaker 1: It smells like a train game.

507
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,410
Speaker 0: The board is trains.

508
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,370
Speaker 0: You take little plastic trains, and you make routes, and you think, "Hey, it's a train

509
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:42,523
Speaker 0: game.".

510
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:48,150
Speaker 0: No, this is actually a card game with a complex score-keeping mechanism built into the board.

511
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:50,102
Speaker 1: That is mostly true.

512
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,390
Speaker 0: It is a set-building card game, and there is not a lot else to it.

513
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,450
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of tactical stuff.

514
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,569
Speaker 1: That's quite similar to what was it?

515
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,682
Speaker 1: Was the Mario Nostrum?

516
00:27:58,703 --> 00:27:59,229
Speaker 1: was the game?

517
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,010
Speaker 0: I think so.

518
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:02,889
Speaker 1: That was also the card game where the boats didn't really mean that much.

519
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:09,510
Speaker 0: But then there's, like, Moitre and Verator that just straight up only have cards.

520
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, these aren't too similar to those.

521
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,910
Speaker 0: I know, but I point out that those games didn't sell so well.

522
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,530
Speaker 1: Well, Moitre and Verator were never put out in English.

523
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:16,928
Speaker 1: Yeah.

524
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:18,450
Speaker 1: They sold well in Germany.

525
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,190
Speaker 0: Everything sells well in Germany.

526
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:20,870
Speaker 1: Right, anyway.

527
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:26,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the way Ticket to Ride works, basically, is -- and this is also the reason the game is so fun.

528
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,769
Speaker 1: I'll get to after -- you'll see, maybe, when I explain the rules, right?

529
00:28:30,152 --> 00:28:32,750
Speaker 1: There's a board, and the board is a bunch of cities, right?

530
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:38,109
Speaker 1: And the cities are connected with tracks of different colors, some of them gray, some of, you know, colors, right?

531
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:39,509
Speaker 1: And there's some cards.

532
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,990
Speaker 1: And at the beginning of the game, everyone gets these routes, right?

533
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,989
Speaker 1: These route cards.

534
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:45,250
Speaker 1: And the route cards are special.

535
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:51,881
Speaker 1: The route card will say something like New York, Chicago, 10 points, or New York, LA, 25 points, right?

536
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,569
Speaker 1: Because that's a lot harder, right?

537
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:56,570
Speaker 1: And you're trying to fulfill those routes.

538
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,530
Speaker 1: You want to have your trains of your color going from one of the city to the other.

539
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:13,150
Speaker 1: And what I usually do to win the game is I'll have, like, a big route and then some small routes, and I will try to, you know, in getting the big route, also get the small route.

540
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:22,629
Speaker 1: So, for example, let's say I have two routes and one of them is New York, LA, and one of them is, I don't know, Oklahoma City to Chicago.

541
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,728
Speaker 0: Sault Ste.

542
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,390
Speaker 0: Marie.

543
00:29:25,572 --> 00:29:26,127
Speaker 1: To Sault Ste.

544
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:26,764
Speaker 1: Marie, right?

545
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,569
Speaker 1: So I would go from New York to Sault Ste.

546
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,289
Speaker 1: Marie to Oklahoma City to LA.

547
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:34,630
Speaker 1: That way I can accomplish both with the minimal number of trains.

548
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,410
Speaker 1: It's the basic strategy of the game, right?

549
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:37,649
Speaker 0: Well, strategy.

550
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,670
Speaker 0: I mean, it's one of those games, right?

551
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,810
Speaker 0: Pretty much the strategy.

552
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,870
Speaker 1: It's kind of obvious.

553
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:47,330
Speaker 0: You look at your routes and you think, what is the most optimal way to get these?

554
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:54,928
Speaker 0: And then you think, all right, now, in addition to that, who is going to be trying to get in my way and whose way should I get in?

555
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:55,850
Speaker 1: Yeah.

556
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,968
Speaker 1: And you basically try to accomplish your routes in the least amount of time possible, the least number of resources.

557
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:04,270
Speaker 1: Right now, on your turn, you have four options.

558
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,889
Speaker 1: You can either draw train cards.

559
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,550
Speaker 1: You can put trains on the board by spending train cards.

560
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:11,570
Speaker 1: You can draw new routes.

561
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:15,965
Speaker 1: If you finish all your routes, you can draw new ones, which means you're probably going to win.

562
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:22,870
Speaker 1: Or you can, I guess that's a special option in the Europe one, because I'm looking at the Europe rules, the train stations.

563
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,490
Speaker 1: Is that an option in the other one?

564
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:25,530
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

565
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,530
Speaker 1: I don't remember either.

566
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,250
Speaker 1: Well, we'll talk about the train stations later.

567
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,109
Speaker 0: We'll see how much of an impression this game made on us.

568
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,790
Speaker 1: The train stations are not that important.

569
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,009
Speaker 0: Yes, they are.

570
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:33,929
Speaker 0: But anyway.

571
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:34,889
Speaker 1: Well, they are, I guess.

572
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,710
Speaker 1: But anyway, when you draw train cards, this is the good mechanic number ones.

573
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,410
Speaker 1: He's a game of good mechanics that don't come together to create the greatest game.

574
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:43,826
Speaker 1: It's a good game.

575
00:30:44,194 --> 00:30:44,750
Speaker 0: It's a fun game.

576
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,908
Speaker 0: It's a good like gateway game.

577
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:46,488
Speaker 1: All right.

578
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,109
Speaker 1: Anyway, drawing cards.

579
00:30:48,552 --> 00:30:50,810
Speaker 1: There are a bunch of different colors of train card, right?

580
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:57,389
Speaker 1: And let's say this green train is a green track connecting New York and Rochester.

581
00:30:57,993 --> 00:30:59,650
Speaker 1: I don't even know if Rochester is on the map, right?

582
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:06,849
Speaker 1: If there's green trains making that connection, then you need green cards to be able to build there or wild cards.

583
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:07,230
Speaker 1: Right.

584
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,750
Speaker 1: So you look in his five face up cards and one face down deck.

585
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:18,610
Speaker 1: So you can either draw two face up ones or two face down or a face up and a face down.

586
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,030
Speaker 1: Right.

587
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:27,824
Speaker 1: And the thing is, if there's a wild card face up, if you take that, you can't take anything else.

588
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:28,869
Speaker 1: So you can only take one.

589
00:31:29,058 --> 00:31:29,206
Speaker 0: Yep.

590
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,390
Speaker 0: Now, also, when you build a route with your little trains, you put the trains down pretty much like you see a route.

591
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:35,949
Speaker 0: It's blue and it's got three spaces.

592
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:39,130
Speaker 0: You got to play three blue cards or two blue in a wild.

593
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:39,646
Speaker 1: Yeah.

594
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,444
Speaker 1: Or three wilds.

595
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:40,900
Speaker 0: Yeah.

596
00:31:42,177 --> 00:31:43,509
Speaker 0: Or a wild into blue.

597
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:52,270
Speaker 1: So you just you really try to get the, you know, the color that you need to make the connection you need to or the most urgent connection you need on your route.

598
00:31:52,350 --> 00:32:01,525
Speaker 1: So, you know, if I have this big long route planned out and most of it, nobody's anywhere near, but there's a lot of action going on in Chicago and I need a specific route that's going to take four reds.

599
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,089
Speaker 1: I'm going to be drawn lots of reds whenever I can.

600
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:04,503
Speaker 1: Yeah.

601
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:09,410
Speaker 0: Now, you also get kind of increasing returns that the more trains you use, the more segments in each route.

602
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,748
Speaker 0: When you make a segment, you also get points for it.

603
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:12,366
Speaker 1: Yep.

604
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:18,509
Speaker 0: And like you get one point for a one segment, two for a two, six for a three.

605
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:21,830
Speaker 0: Or I may I don't know if that it's a scribble.

606
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,670
Speaker 0: I'm looking at an image.

607
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,890
Speaker 0: It's like depending, you know, there's ten for a five and fifteen for a six.

608
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,086
Speaker 0: Yeah.

609
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:34,729
Speaker 1: Since the map is such a big web of all these different routes, you can get from point A to point B like going three or four different ways.

610
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:44,110
Speaker 1: So you you the game sort of encourages you to go the ways where there are longer stretches of track between dots and you'll get more points that way.

611
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:51,130
Speaker 1: But then again, it'll be slower and you'll have a better chance of failing because in the places where there are shorter tracks, there's a lot more dots.

612
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,989
Speaker 1: There's a lot more alternate routes if someone comes in and screws you.

613
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:02,710
Speaker 0: Now, we we could talk about strategy or like how to be good at this game or whatever, but I mean, we did that with settlers.

614
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,169
Speaker 0: It was pretty easy with this game.

615
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,256
Speaker 0: It's kind of much.

616
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,390
Speaker 0: just do the most logical thing.

617
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,690
Speaker 0: There's very little strategy to think about, really.

618
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:17,989
Speaker 1: But the thing about this game that makes it great, especially for getting new people into more quality games, is this right on your turn.

619
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:19,870
Speaker 1: You only you can't like draw.

620
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,390
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, you look at other games, right?

621
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,809
Speaker 1: And they say, what do you do on your turn?

622
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:26,090
Speaker 1: Well, in the first phase of your turn, you do this.

623
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,348
Speaker 1: And on the second phase, you do that.

624
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:28,470
Speaker 1: This game doesn't have that.

625
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,830
Speaker 1: This game has on your turn, you either draw cards or claim a route.

626
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,029
Speaker 1: That's most of what you're going to be doing most of the time.

627
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:35,368
Speaker 0: Yep.

628
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,250
Speaker 0: And the options you have when doing that are also very limited.

629
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,568
Speaker 0: I mean, there's not that much on the board.

630
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,548
Speaker 0: There aren't that many colors.

631
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:47,472
Speaker 0: Not like, say, El Grande, where I can get any number between one and like 16.

632
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:50,390
Speaker 0: And each number has different values and different things.

633
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:56,549
Speaker 1: And on your turn, you're pretty much either drawing cards or spending cards to put trains on the board, one or the other.

634
00:33:57,174 --> 00:33:59,250
Speaker 1: And it's very quick.

635
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,010
Speaker 1: You're doing a very small action.

636
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,750
Speaker 1: So you go around and everyone on their turn does a very small action.

637
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,070
Speaker 1: Small action, right?

638
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,710
Speaker 1: So you go around and I do something quick.

639
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,290
Speaker 1: The person left of me does something quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

640
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,610
Speaker 1: Everyone does lots and lots of little things.

641
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:15,290
Speaker 1: And this keeps the game moving.

642
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:16,750
Speaker 1: You're constantly doing things.

643
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,270
Speaker 1: You're not spending a lot of time waiting for people to take their turns.

644
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,949
Speaker 1: Your turn doesn't have a whole lot to think about.

645
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:29,429
Speaker 1: You're thinking more as a collection of turns, but you're still constantly working your way towards that big thing.

646
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,230
Speaker 1: And then the thing about that is everyone's constantly playing.

647
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,310
Speaker 1: You're never out of the game.

648
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,270
Speaker 1: You're not really bored.

649
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:36,610
Speaker 1: The game keeps you engaged.

650
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:40,050
Speaker 0: And you don't need to worry about novice players needing to bevagon their ass.

651
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:50,570
Speaker 1: You don't have to think too hard at any particular juncture, you know, and it keeps the game at a good pace and it makes it a lot of fun for people who aren't super gamers.

652
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:56,668
Speaker 0: But if you're a hardcore gamer, still buy this game because it's a great game to get people into board gaming.

653
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:00,069
Speaker 0: And like other games we have that aren't the super best games, it's fun.

654
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,850
Speaker 0: I mean, Carcassonne is solved.

655
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,090
Speaker 0: Settlers is solved, but they can still be fun to play depending on the situation.

656
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:08,830
Speaker 1: And it can also handle a lot of players, like up to like five players.

657
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,330
Speaker 1: It's not bad for more than some other games.

658
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,610
Speaker 0: It's also a pretty quick play.

659
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,149
Speaker 0: It's something you can just whip out and play now.

660
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,710
Speaker 1: It's also really colorful and happy.

661
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,670
Speaker 0: We didn't own the game.

662
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,308
Speaker 0: Our friends James and Lisa had it, so they brought it and we played it with them and we never bought it.

663
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,369
Speaker 1: But we liked it the times we played it.

664
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:24,541
Speaker 1: Yeah.

665
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,130
Speaker 0: So as a result, I was in the store, a Millennium in Rochester, and I saw Europe Edition.

666
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,290
Speaker 0: I thought, all right, well, I already played the normal one.

667
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,790
Speaker 0: I might as well just buy this edition and own that one instead.

668
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,770
Speaker 0: It can't be that different.

669
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:39,450
Speaker 1: Well, the Europe version adds two things that are kind of crappy.

670
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,730
Speaker 0: Randomness and more randomness.

671
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:53,308
Speaker 0: If you, sir, were tired of playing games where skill determines the victor, if you were bad at games and were frustrated at the fact that you lost due to your own lack of ability, have no fear.

672
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,530
Speaker 0: Ticket to Ride Europe is your game.

673
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:57,250
Speaker 1: So it has these tunnels, right?

674
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,601
Speaker 1: And the way the tunnels work is.

675
00:35:58,621 --> 00:35:59,690
Speaker 1: it's just a normal route.

676
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:00,128
Speaker 1: Right.

677
00:36:00,651 --> 00:36:03,550
Speaker 1: But if you want to build on the route, you like roll a dice.

678
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,009
Speaker 1: You roll one die, I think.

679
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:05,690
Speaker 1: Right.

680
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:06,170
Speaker 1: Is that right?

681
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:15,070
Speaker 0: No, it's pretty much you play out, like say you play out whatever many cards it is of the right color, and then you draw three more colors.

682
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:15,442
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

683
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,989
Speaker 0: And if you it's like you have you gamble and you can bet on the odds of finishing the tunnel or not.

684
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,310
Speaker 0: If you finish it, great.

685
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,269
Speaker 0: If you don't, well, you just wasted a turn.

686
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:25,850
Speaker 1: Yeah.

687
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,710
Speaker 1: It's like basically let's say a tunnel is three trains long.

688
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,010
Speaker 1: Right.

689
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:32,170
Speaker 1: So I try to build it and I have the three trains.

690
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:36,070
Speaker 1: Then we do this random thing and it might turn out that I need to.

691
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,149
Speaker 0: I'll read the actual rules.

692
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:37,403
Speaker 1: OK.

693
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:42,768
Speaker 0: When attempting to claim a tunnel route, a player first lays down the number of cards required by the route's length.

694
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:43,812
Speaker 0: Then turn.

695
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:49,210
Speaker 0: the top three cards from the train deck for each card reveal that matches the color used to claim the route.

696
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,010
Speaker 0: An additional card of the same color must be played to successfully claim the route.

697
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:58,489
Speaker 0: If a player does not have enough cards, he takes all his cards back and the turn ends.

698
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:05,269
Speaker 1: Depending on luck, you might lose a turn, but you could sort of mitigate that by having extra cards in your hand.

699
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:13,328
Speaker 1: But then you might have to spend five cards to build a route that's only three long just to avoid losing a turn.

700
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:22,588
Speaker 1: So it's basically, you know, you can build this route, but you might get randomly fucked and it doesn't really add a lot to the game, but just sort of makes it annoying if you need one of those routes.

701
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:30,814
Speaker 1: The other thing the game as the ferries, which basically you need to have wild cards or some number of them to do.

702
00:37:30,854 --> 00:37:37,530
Speaker 1: some of the ferry routes like this is one ferry route that goes from Smyrna to Palermo and it's six spaces long.

703
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:42,670
Speaker 1: And you could use any four cards you want that are the same color, but even wild cards.

704
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,430
Speaker 1: But you need two wild cards through those last two spots or else you can't do it.

705
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,018
Speaker 0: Now, we haven't played any of the other.

706
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,110
Speaker 0: well, the other expansion is the Marklin.

707
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,310
Speaker 1: It's they're not expansions.

708
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,850
Speaker 1: They're alternate versions of the game.

709
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,049
Speaker 1: You could buy Europe on its own.

710
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,068
Speaker 1: Marklin on its own.

711
00:37:55,555 --> 00:37:56,450
Speaker 1: It's not an expansion.

712
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,670
Speaker 1: You don't need to own regular tickets to ride to get tickets to ride Europe.

713
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,870
Speaker 1: They're separate games entirely.

714
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:09,610
Speaker 0: But frankly, as far as I can see, the only thing you should buy is the original one is probably the best one, unless someone has played the third one and it's actually great.

715
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,649
Speaker 1: People say that people say the Marklin one has like these passengers that you have to deliver.

716
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:17,170
Speaker 1: And I don't remember what the mechanic is, but it could be good.

717
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:17,668
Speaker 1: It could be bad.

718
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:18,127
Speaker 1: I don't know.

719
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:18,969
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

720
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,604
Speaker 0: But the most important thing is that it's pronounced Sue St.

721
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:24,627
Speaker 0: Marie, not salt.

722
00:38:27,671 --> 00:38:29,169
Speaker 1: Also, green trains are the best.

723
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:30,090
Speaker 0: I don't know.

724
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:32,490
Speaker 0: Highly partial to the bright, searing blue.

725
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,425
Speaker 1: Anyway, the yeah.

726
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:41,769
Speaker 1: If you're the hardcore type of gamer person, you know, you this game, go back to playing El Grande in Puerto Rico.

727
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:43,489
Speaker 1: You're not going to play this game too much.

728
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:55,330
Speaker 1: But if you got a family, if you're trying to introduce people to maybe a world where there's, you know, cooler games in a world where games don't suck as much as Monopoly, you know, you can get someone to play tickets to ride.

729
00:38:55,551 --> 00:39:01,830
Speaker 0: You know, it won't be that hard in a world where guess who isn't ruined by the fact that you're guys wearing glasses, right?

730
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,428
Speaker 1: And then they'll probably like it.

731
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:14,130
Speaker 1: And once you get them to play tickets to ride, you know, you'll be able to get them to play other games that look sort of similar that are much more complicated, like Puerto Rico or Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne or whatever.

732
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:16,370
Speaker 1: So, yeah, take it to ride.

733
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:16,828
Speaker 1: Not bad.

734
00:39:17,511 --> 00:39:26,590
Speaker 0: And on that note, I got to finish preparing for Katsucon because we're doing a lot of stuff at this convention and we're leaving tomorrow, I guess Thursday morning tomorrow.

735
00:39:26,694 --> 00:39:26,969
Speaker 1: Yes.

736
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:34,949
Speaker 0: But I'm pretty much going to come home from work, look at my things that I'm going to be doing stuff with at the con, put them on a laptop and then go to bed.

737
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:35,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

738
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:41,168
Speaker 0: And then the next day, me and Pete going to play some advanced wars for five hours while Scout drives.

739
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,329
Speaker 1: Well, you know, what else are you going to be doing?

740
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,268
Speaker 0: What are we going to be doing?

741
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,106
Speaker 1: Buying gas.

742
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:46,129
Speaker 0: That's fine.

743
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,528
Speaker 0: Whatever.

744
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:48,309
Speaker 0: It's not that far.

745
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,530
Speaker 0: It's like an hour past Otacon.

746
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:50,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

747
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,230
Speaker 1: It's still, you can also pay for media at the Bob Evans.

748
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:54,989
Speaker 0: Oh, that Bob Evans.

749
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,310
Speaker 0: That Bob Evans saved my life and saved my life as well.

750
00:39:58,511 --> 00:39:59,590
Speaker 0: But that's the story for another time.

751
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,929
Speaker 0: Stay tuned tomorrow night.

752
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:08,670
Speaker 0: The story of Bob Evans, where not only are we going to tomorrow night, talk about Katsucon and everything that's going on there, but we're going to review something important.

753
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,770
Speaker 0: It's one of those, you know, anime world order.

754
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,970
Speaker 0: They're a big anime podcast and then other podcasts that review things.

755
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:18,710
Speaker 0: There's always those big ones, the big names that they you're almost afraid to review.

756
00:40:18,872 --> 00:40:20,530
Speaker 0: Like, I don't think I could do it justice.

757
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,505
Speaker 0: I got to wait.

758
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,805
Speaker 0: You never actually do it.

759
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:32,789
Speaker 0: Well, we're doing it, so we're not going to say what, but it should be pretty obvious that tomorrow night we're going to be reviewing the greatest animated television series ever created.
