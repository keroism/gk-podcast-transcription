1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,466
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, October 4th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:13,007
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:13,668
Speaker 0: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:19,419
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights tonight in the Geek Nights Book Club, The Man Who Was Thursday by G.K.

5
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:20,060
Speaker 1: Chesterton.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,782
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:27,309
Speaker 0: Do you remember?

8
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:28,291
Speaker 0: Mr.

9
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:28,672
Speaker 0: Bubble.

10
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:30,094
Speaker 1: Mr.

11
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:30,475
Speaker 1: Bubble?

12
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:31,797
Speaker 1: I remember Mr.

13
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:32,077
Speaker 1: Bubble.

14
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:32,258
Speaker 1: Mr.

15
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:32,919
Speaker 0: Bubble's the shit.

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,620
Speaker 0: That's all I'm saying.

17
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,746
Speaker 1: So you want to have a bubble bath?

18
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:37,470
Speaker 0: That's what you're saying.

19
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:41,160
Speaker 1: I have not had a bubble bath since my age was single digits.

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,041
Speaker 0: Check it out.

21
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,043
Speaker 0: They still make this shit.

22
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:43,925
Speaker 0: Of course they do.

23
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:47,414
Speaker 0: But the thing is I think now it's all non-toxic, ultra safe.

24
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:50,100
Speaker 0: I don't know what it was in our day if it was a different formulation.

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,242
Speaker 1: It's just soap.

26
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:53,206
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't clean you.

27
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:55,692
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to clean you to be soap.

28
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:58,800
Speaker 1: There's no definition of soap that says cleans you.

29
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:01,626
Speaker 0: But they actually do make Mr.

30
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:05,394
Speaker 0: Bubble shampoo and body wash, brand stuff.

31
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:06,556
Speaker 1: You only want the bubble bath.

32
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,931
Speaker 1: I, as a kid, never understood the appeal of bubble baths.

33
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,878
Speaker 0: When I was extremely small it was like, "Oh fuck yeah,

34
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:16,239
Speaker 0: bubbles.".

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,300
Speaker 1: See, I didn't care about the bubbles because I had this little thing that hung over the tub on the side and it was like this play school boathouse.

36
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:25,162
Speaker 0: I had boats.

37
00:01:25,463 --> 00:01:31,279
Speaker 1: No, it was a boathouse that hung over the side of the tub and had a little landing for the boats to go into and little people could live in it.

38
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,244
Speaker 1: So basically I'd hang out with that.

39
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:36,750
Speaker 1: If it was bubble bath, then that ruins my fun.

40
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,820
Speaker 1: Because now it's not like happy boat town, it's horrible foam town.

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,857
Speaker 0: My trains and boats, they were the kind that stuck to the wall of the tub.

42
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:46,800
Speaker 0: Oh, mine floated.

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,188
Speaker 0: Oh, so I could play on the wall of the tub.

44
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,879
Speaker 0: And then I also had a floaty boat and some other things.

45
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,288
Speaker 1: I also had the Lego cargo ship.

46
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,997
Speaker 0: I had this book that you could read in the tub.

47
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:57,860
Speaker 0: I had one of those.

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,260
Speaker 0: And it was about this penguin and you would take the penguin out of the book and insert him into the waterproof pages.

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:13,118
Speaker 1: The two things related to Lego in my life, three things that I wanted that actually were those kind of unattainable dreams of childhood were one, the monorail.

50
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:13,900
Speaker 1: Of course.

51
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,742
Speaker 0: No one has it.

52
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:16,490
Speaker 1: I knew a kid who had it.

53
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:17,775
Speaker 0: Kid's spoiled.

54
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:18,780
Speaker 1: He wouldn't let me play with it.

55
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:19,523
Speaker 0: He's rich.

56
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:20,448
Speaker 0: He's spoiled.

57
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:21,855
Speaker 0: And he probably went nowhere in life.

58
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:22,800
Speaker 0: Probably hipster.

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,172
Speaker 1: I wanted the space shuttle.

60
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:25,615
Speaker 1: And you know what?

61
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:26,339
Speaker 1: I got that one.

62
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:33,760
Speaker 1: And three, I wanted the motor that went on the back of the cargo ship boat.

63
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:34,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had the boat.

64
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,540
Speaker 0: We did not have the motor.

65
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,629
Speaker 1: I never saw that motor in person.

66
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,980
Speaker 0: I didn't even see the motor in the Lego catalog.

67
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,479
Speaker 1: I only knew it existed because the instruction book had instructions for connecting it to the boat.

68
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:49,838
Speaker 0: I looked in that Lego catalog for that boat and I didn't fucking see it, but I mostly bought Castle Lego.

69
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:50,540
Speaker 0: That's what I wanted.

70
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,200
Speaker 1: I was mostly the Space Lego.

71
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:53,610
Speaker 0: My brother got Space Lego.

72
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:54,660
Speaker 0: I was all about Castle Lego.

73
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,340
Speaker 1: In fact, when Ice Planet came out, you know what we used to do?

74
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,134
Speaker 0: I had one Ice Planet.

75
00:02:58,154 --> 00:02:58,800
Speaker 0: He had the orange chainsaw.

76
00:02:59,381 --> 00:02:59,979
Speaker 1: I had the base.

77
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,231
Speaker 0: But yeah, no, the best is friggin' Castle.

78
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,280
Speaker 0: I mean, how could you not want Kniggetts and Robin Hoods?

79
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:11,171
Speaker 0: The Robin Hood forest men were even better than the Castle ones.

80
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,180
Speaker 0: They'd be like, with their bow and arrows.

81
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:14,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bow and arrow's okay.

82
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:17,600
Speaker 1: That whip that every kid used to make a makeshift gallows.

83
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:24,280
Speaker 0: I had so many whips and those little leafy green things and drawbridges and trees.

84
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,264
Speaker 1: I didn't have any of the bridges.

85
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:27,052
Speaker 1: I only had one Castle and it wasn't Lego.

86
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:29,000
Speaker 1: It was like this knockoff Lego.

87
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only thing I couldn't get, though, is I wanted the big fucking Castle.

88
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:33,316
Speaker 0: I didn't get that.

89
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:33,597
Speaker 0: The $100 Castle.

90
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:35,854
Speaker 0: Nowadays, the $300 Castle.

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,264
Speaker 1: Not a normal show.

92
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,790
Speaker 1: Book club show.

93
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:40,397
Speaker 1: You might have forgotten about the book club.

94
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:41,060
Speaker 1: It's been a while.

95
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:42,506
Speaker 1: It's also a pretty short book.

96
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,394
Speaker 1: I have a feeling many of you didn't read it.

97
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:45,820
Speaker 1: You should've.

98
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,758
Speaker 0: So I have a funny story also.

99
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,637
Speaker 1: If this story begins with, "So I didn't read the

100
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:51,859
Speaker 1: book.".

101
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,026
Speaker 0: No, I read the fucking book.

102
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,736
Speaker 0: So on Reddit, some girl, and this is a New York City Reddit, right?

103
00:03:58,077 --> 00:04:00,539
Speaker 1: Some girl posted- Oh wait, so you're doing a thing of the day.

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,162
Speaker 0: No.

105
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,055
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

106
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:04,927
Speaker 0: She posted this story.

107
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,253
Speaker 0: She's an Asian foreign student.

108
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:09,720
Speaker 0: She's engaged to a lovely boyfriend who is white.

109
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:16,899
Speaker 0: Her loving and protective Korean mother does not know any of this and she has been lying to her for over a year.

110
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,382
Speaker 0: She basically made up this elaborate ruse to tell her family- Wait a minute.

111
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:23,460
Speaker 1: So far, this is the plot of Summer Wars.

112
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,320
Speaker 0: Right.

113
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:26,469
Speaker 0: So she lives in New York.

114
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,638
Speaker 0: She's engaged to this white dude.

115
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,120
Speaker 1: Does she need a stand-in Asian dude to be a fake boyfriend?

116
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:42,473
Speaker 0: She has been telling this elaborate ruse for a long time and she basically needs an apartment and people to keep this lie alive when people come to-.

117
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:48,900
Speaker 1: So, you know, it'd be great.

118
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:57,674
Speaker 1: If we got someone to respond to this and be all legit and set it all up and when the family arrives, don't reveal the truth.

119
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:01,140
Speaker 1: Just make everything really weird.

120
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:08,060
Speaker 0: She was offering $100 or more for help and various people replied on Reddit.

121
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:10,299
Speaker 0: Her mom found it?

122
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:17,560
Speaker 0: No, and then the Gothamist posted a story about her post, so it is spreading her ridiculous lie.

123
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,339
Speaker 1: This might be right up there with Captain Buttshugger.

124
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,089
Speaker 0: It's like, why would you even?

125
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:29,760
Speaker 1: It's like, these are the kind of people- So Scott, remember, remember what ruined the plot of 99% of books and movies anyone could ever write from this point forward in time?

126
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,200
Speaker 1: The existence of the cell phone and the internet.

127
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:40,440
Speaker 1: These sorts of plots are perfectly viable in a world where there is no way for mom to find out that Reddit exists.

128
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:47,512
Speaker 0: I doubt mom will find out, but this is still, why don't you just come clean?

129
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:48,033
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

130
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:51,600
Speaker 0: It's so much easier than maintaining this incredibly elaborate ruse.

131
00:05:51,920 --> 00:06:02,240
Speaker 1: Yes, Scott, it is so much easier if you are in fact someone like you or me, but for an average person, you would rather die than let that secret be revealed than deal with your mom dealing with that.

132
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:04,317
Speaker 1: I'm not that way.

133
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I don't want to have nothing to do with you.

134
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,139
Speaker 1: No, see, here's what we do.

135
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,760
Speaker 0: If you're a crazy person who will create drama, stay away from me.

136
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,248
Speaker 1: We respond, get one of our Asian friends and do the whole thing like super legit.

137
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:22,960
Speaker 1: And then when the mom shows up, the Asian friend is there, but he acts like he's not the actual boyfriend.

138
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:29,220
Speaker 0: And we have like, I don't know- Oh, we just tell the truth for them because they can't do it themselves?

139
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:37,210
Speaker 1: So we get like a black Russian dude to then act like he's the boyfriend and just make everything double weird.

140
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:44,700
Speaker 1: So now the girl has two options, come clean herself or deal with this doubly ridiculous double trick.

141
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:49,072
Speaker 1: That is what I would do if I were an enterprising young asshole.

142
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:53,300
Speaker 0: Luckily for this person- I would have nothing to do with dramatic people.

143
00:06:54,201 --> 00:07:00,176
Speaker 0: I just think it was really- I will laugh at them from afar across the Internet.

144
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,360
Speaker 0: That is what I'm doing right now.

145
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:07,320
Speaker 1: A younger rim would engage in elaborate hoax, but I'm old enough now to merely plan the hoax and plant the seed.

146
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,800
Speaker 0: Maybe her mom listened to Geek Nights.

147
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:13,459
Speaker 1: You know, we should try to track down the mom and interview her.

148
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:18,000
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure there will be at least one more post about this on the Internet.

149
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,421
Speaker 0: Of course.

150
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:19,664
Speaker 1: Fark has one of the-.

151
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:20,706
Speaker 1: you know, this is very important.

152
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:27,260
Speaker 1: Very few websites on the Internet do this and Fark does it and I feel like it's worth noting because it's related to this.

153
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,429
Speaker 1: Fark has many tags like S9 or boobies or whatever the story is.

154
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,340
Speaker 1: Florida, if it happens in Florida, there's one tag, follow up.

155
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:40,767
Speaker 1: Follow up is the best tag on Fark.

156
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:46,340
Speaker 1: That is when you find out what happened to crazy dude who got arrested for chugging wine up his butt.

157
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,290
Speaker 0: But aren't half of those things going to be lame?

158
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,597
Speaker 0: Like, oh, guy just went to jail.

159
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:50,280
Speaker 0: They don't want long.

160
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,700
Speaker 1: No, they only follow up if it's interesting or if people cared how it turned out.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,082
Speaker 1: But anyway, I digress.

162
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,685
Speaker 1: I think it's time for things of the day.

163
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:07,198
Speaker 1: So I'm going to cue up that little music there and Mr.

164
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:08,339
Speaker 1: Bubble or Mr.

165
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,680
Speaker 1: Bucket.

166
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,421
Speaker 0: Mr.

167
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:10,082
Speaker 0: Bucket sucks.

168
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:11,083
Speaker 0: Fark Mr.

169
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:11,924
Speaker 0: Bucket up the ass.

170
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:13,206
Speaker 0: Mr.

171
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:14,068
Speaker 0: Bubble versus Mr.

172
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:14,368
Speaker 0: Bucket.

173
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:14,969
Speaker 0: You know, Mr.

174
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,832
Speaker 0: Bubble just walk in me like, boom, Mr.

175
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:17,393
Speaker 0: Bucket's out.

176
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:17,913
Speaker 0: Mr.

177
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:22,180
Speaker 0: Bucket will be full of bubbles and then he'll choke to death on the bubbles and balls will come out of his mouth.

178
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,647
Speaker 1: I wonder if people have seen that, actually.

179
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:26,099
Speaker 0: His balls will come right out of his mouth and that's the end.

180
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:27,963
Speaker 1: I'm going to do two things today.

181
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:29,385
Speaker 1: I'm going to cheat here.

182
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:39,320
Speaker 1: So if you haven't seen it, our good pseudo internet friend, and I talk to him occasionally via email, but we've never talked in person ever.

183
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,269
Speaker 1: The angry video game nerd.

184
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,499
Speaker 0: He doesn't know who we are.

185
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,580
Speaker 1: Did a video that is a dramatic sort of ghost story.

186
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,362
Speaker 1: It's a review.

187
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,606
Speaker 1: Centered around Mr.

188
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:49,987
Speaker 1: Bucket.

189
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,019
Speaker 1: And it is actually one of the greatest pieces of cinema posted to the internet.

190
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,705
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you've mentioned this in the show before.

191
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:57,652
Speaker 1: But in case we haven't, I make it my thing of the day.

192
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:58,454
Speaker 0: But my real thing of the day.

193
00:08:58,474 --> 00:08:59,899
Speaker 0: I think I've also told the story of how I got Mr.

194
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,120
Speaker 0: Bucket.

195
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:01,663
Speaker 1: Yes, you have.

196
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:02,164
Speaker 1: I remember that.

197
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:04,589
Speaker 0: Oh, speaking of Angry Video Game Nerd, you know what month it is.

198
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:05,952
Speaker 1: Oh.

199
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:06,713
Speaker 0: Yeah.

200
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,317
Speaker 1: So I've already missed, what, four of them?

201
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:09,800
Speaker 0: No, he's doing them every other day.

202
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,944
Speaker 1: Ah, come on.

203
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:12,845
Speaker 0: Thirty one.

204
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,550
Speaker 1: It's all 80s themed.

205
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,473
Speaker 0: They're all 80s themed all month.

206
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:21,160
Speaker 1: Wait, so that means that means are we going to get Halloween three?

207
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,121
Speaker 0: No.

208
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:29,820
Speaker 0: Do you remember that movie we watched with Amber about like the ghost, the monster that came out of the TV with the satellite dish in the backyard?

209
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,835
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, I don't know what it's called, but that one was in the trailer.

210
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:37,500
Speaker 0: So he's going to do it some point during the month.

211
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,081
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

212
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:40,805
Speaker 1: That movie is right up there with the stuff.

213
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:42,968
Speaker 1: Anyway, that was an error.

214
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:43,369
Speaker 1: We'd watch.

215
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,771
Speaker 1: In fact, you were not there.

216
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,992
Speaker 0: Do your real thing.

217
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:51,060
Speaker 1: Of all the bad movies that Amber showed us, the worst is the one you were not there to see.

218
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,322
Speaker 0: Do your thing of the day.

219
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:52,983
Speaker 0: That's the real thing.

220
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:53,665
Speaker 1: It is called.

221
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:54,647
Speaker 1: I'm going to put this out here.

222
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,551
Speaker 1: This movie is called Boxing Helena.

223
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:58,355
Speaker 1: Good God.

224
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,780
Speaker 1: So anyway, my real thing of the day.

225
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:02,902
Speaker 1: Watch the movie.

226
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:06,288
Speaker 1: carbonated apple slices.

227
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:07,930
Speaker 1: This dude made a bunch of videos.

228
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:09,653
Speaker 0: Basically, he's kind of like those.

229
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:10,495
Speaker 0: How does that even work?

230
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:11,576
Speaker 1: Table of videos.

231
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,760
Speaker 1: guys who make like the awesome chemistry videos.

232
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:23,000
Speaker 1: This guy has a whole bunch of carbon dioxide in various forms and a pressure vessel and just does stuff with carbon dioxide.

233
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:36,700
Speaker 0: So I guess if you put an apple into a chamber that was sealed and the chamber was full of carbon dioxide and the pressure was high, the carbon dioxide would be forced into the apple where it would go into the apple juice and that is in the apple and fizz it up.

234
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,924
Speaker 0: So now you have a sparkling apple.

235
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:40,647
Speaker 1: So basically, this guy did a bunch of stuff.

236
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:44,816
Speaker 1: Like, for example, he makes supercritical CO2 and just shows you how fucking awesome that is.

237
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:46,580
Speaker 1: It's used in dry cleaning and stuff.

238
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,364
Speaker 1: And anyway, this video, yes, he just carbonate some apple slices and then he eats them.

239
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:50,845
Speaker 1: And you know what?

240
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:53,108
Speaker 1: Apparently they are goddamn delicious.

241
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:55,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, they probably just hurt.

242
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:56,852
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forget.

243
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:58,814
Speaker 1: You can't deal with carbonation.

244
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:00,156
Speaker 0: It's one of those.

245
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:01,177
Speaker 0: It is not a good thing.

246
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:02,198
Speaker 1: I can't imagine.

247
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:03,680
Speaker 0: It's also not good for you.

248
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,341
Speaker 1: Cite that.

249
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:06,403
Speaker 1: Cite a source on that.

250
00:11:06,443 --> 00:11:07,524
Speaker 0: I've read stuff.

251
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:12,411
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you read about how cold water hydrates you faster.

252
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:14,835
Speaker 1: No, that is what you said.

253
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:16,958
Speaker 1: I have chat logs, Captain Fuckwit.

254
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,500
Speaker 1: I need to pull this out.

255
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,083
Speaker 0: You're the one who is so insistent for many years.

256
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:22,405
Speaker 0: You didn't even have anything.

257
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:26,351
Speaker 0: But you were insistent that warm water hydrated you faster.

258
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:27,653
Speaker 0: But you didn't even have one.

259
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:28,855
Speaker 1: I had one link.

260
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:32,640
Speaker 0: What I said, you did say that it is exactly what you said.

261
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,047
Speaker 1: I said that I think warm water hydrates you better, but I don't know.

262
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,830
Speaker 0: No, you are editing history.

263
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:40,193
Speaker 0: That is a rebase.

264
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:44,420
Speaker 0: If I check the GetReRef log, we can see what really happened.

265
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,562
Speaker 1: Okay, anyway, what you think of the day, Captain?

266
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:47,143
Speaker 0: Avoiding.

267
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:52,269
Speaker 0: Okay, so this is another New York City person, right?

268
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,255
Speaker 0: This girl does a website called TenderNuggets.com and she's got cute.

269
00:11:57,315 --> 00:12:01,960
Speaker 0: She basically writes blog posts and illustrates them with really cute, awesome illustrations.

270
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:08,369
Speaker 0: So she went on this odyssey across New York, trying to get home late at night on the subway.

271
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:16,220
Speaker 0: And if you're a New Yorker, you will a hundred times appreciate this entire story with all the pictures that go with it.

272
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,125
Speaker 0: It is super, super true.

273
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,653
Speaker 1: The weird thing, though, is if I had never lived in New York City, you wouldn't get it at all.

274
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:24,654
Speaker 1: No, I would get it.

275
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:27,960
Speaker 1: You can understand the odyssey, but you would not grok it.

276
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:35,712
Speaker 1: Yeah, you and in fact, what's interesting is people who don't live in New York or have never lived in New York read this and go, Oh, my God, what a shitty place to live.

277
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:36,674
Speaker 1: I read it.

278
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:40,540
Speaker 1: And while I can relate, all I can think is I fucking love this city.

279
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like them feels.

280
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,988
Speaker 0: I have all of them.

281
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:49,360
Speaker 1: I have bonded more with this girl who made this comic than I have with the majority of human beings I've ever met.

282
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,163
Speaker 0: And we don't even know who this person is.

283
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:55,971
Speaker 1: That picture we just have a lot up against the window in the hobo car.

284
00:12:56,993 --> 00:13:00,780
Speaker 0: We just have so many shared experiences with this person that we do not know.

285
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,686
Speaker 1: It's interesting how this is like the smell is not of this earth.

286
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:08,874
Speaker 1: The city has so many more people and so many more things.

287
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:12,500
Speaker 1: Yet I feel like I have more shared experiences here than I did in like Beacon.

288
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,021
Speaker 0: Yeah.

289
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:14,102
Speaker 1: Yeah.

290
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:15,945
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I remember you're up.

291
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:17,507
Speaker 1: I pushed you on this.

292
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:19,810
Speaker 1: I was like, give me a citation on your water bullshit.

293
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:26,800
Speaker 1: And you hemmed and hawed for seven minutes and then finally came back with one link on the Camelback.

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,962
Speaker 0: How many links did you have?

295
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:29,884
Speaker 1: I didn't posit anything.

296
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:30,225
Speaker 1: You.

297
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:31,327
Speaker 1: Well, here we go.

298
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:39,960
Speaker 1: And your link said cold water, psychologically speaking, and had no other evidence other than talking about placebos and psychosomatism.

299
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,141
Speaker 0: Hold on.

300
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:42,603
Speaker 0: Let me search here.

301
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,530
Speaker 1: And at no point in this chat do I make any claim.

302
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:56,276
Speaker 1: In fact, all I do is question your claims.

303
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:59,760
Speaker 1: I have never typed in the history of the FRC.

304
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:16,760
Speaker 0: You know, OK, so you are in this case lucky and that your claims were not made in a log chat, but were instead made in a verbal and oral fashion for these cannot be cited for the last five or six years.

305
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,749
Speaker 1: I have never, ever typed the phrase type water types into type any email.

306
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:24,550
Speaker 0: That is correct.

307
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:31,900
Speaker 0: Chad, you have not typed, but you have over the course of many years since college orally stated.

308
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,766
Speaker 1: It's got the body.

309
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:39,338
Speaker 0: human body absorbs warm water faster than cold water.

310
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:39,780
Speaker 1: Prove it.

311
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:41,902
Speaker 0: I don't have to prove it.

312
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:46,789
Speaker 0: It's just known to you for now on.

313
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:54,580
Speaker 0: I'm not chatting with you online ever because apparently, you know, whatever is logged, you know, is what counts.

314
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,318
Speaker 0: But even though you said something one hundred times and everybody knows it.

315
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:00,017
Speaker 1: Room temperature, water is best.

316
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,282
Speaker 0: Metafilter.

317
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:03,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't count.

318
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:06,351
Speaker 1: posted by Campbell in Space on December 26.

319
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:10,440
Speaker 1: So are you now this dude at nine thirty at night?

320
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:17,620
Speaker 0: Are you saying Metafilter is a better source than the Camelback Web site, which you would presume the Camelback would hire water experts?

321
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,080
Speaker 1: The Camelback Web site said only psychologically placebo effect.

322
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,404
Speaker 0: It said the cold water is.

323
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,507
Speaker 0: it said which absorbs.

324
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:31,340
Speaker 0: it had a quiz and it said which temperature is absorbed faster and cold was the correct answer.

325
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,768
Speaker 0: And the other answers were not correct.

326
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:35,554
Speaker 1: So here's why you're.

327
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:37,480
Speaker 0: my link is as good as your vote.

328
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,680
Speaker 1: What you said seeing the Camelback thing again, it says and then this is a link is a copy paste from the link.

329
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:47,640
Speaker 1: At which water temperature does your body hydrate most effectively?

330
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,469
Speaker 1: Now, here's the efficiently.

331
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:50,618
Speaker 0: you didn't even read it properly.

332
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:50,880
Speaker 1: Yes.

333
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,120
Speaker 1: Here is the exact and full text of the response cold.

334
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:57,222
Speaker 1: Yes.

335
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:03,880
Speaker 1: Psychologically speaking, people perceive this to be true, making it true, making it true.

336
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,058
Speaker 1: Therefore, it is amazing how our mind works, isn't it?

337
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:08,384
Speaker 0: Yep.

338
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:12,460
Speaker 0: So it because you perceive it is true, it becomes true.

339
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,202
Speaker 0: It is true.

340
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:18,320
Speaker 1: They are saying in that sentence that it is true, that alcohol is good for me.

341
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,209
Speaker 1: Therefore, it is true.

342
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:22,139
Speaker 0: Camelback says so.

343
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,227
Speaker 0: With water absorption.

344
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:25,549
Speaker 1: Yep.

345
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:28,100
Speaker 1: So I've got my beer absorption going on here.

346
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,834
Speaker 0: Camelback, I trust more than Metafilter guy.

347
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:31,940
Speaker 1: I trust Sapper.

348
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,280
Speaker 0: And when we actually looked up scientific studies, I found out the truth.

349
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:37,143
Speaker 0: The truth is that it doesn't matter.

350
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:45,800
Speaker 0: And you have still always said orally that you have insisted that warm water is better with no sources for years and years and years.

351
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,336
Speaker 1: Now, while I disagree with that, I have said I'm pretty sure or I think.

352
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,260
Speaker 0: No, you have not.

353
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:56,220
Speaker 0: You are editing history because you have the luxury of it not being logged, which is what you do often.

354
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,263
Speaker 1: The odds are.

355
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,996
Speaker 1: So I'm just saying that how come in like six years?

356
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:02,080
Speaker 1: I've never typed that?

357
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:07,980
Speaker 1: You know, you think that I put that much effort into this ridiculous ruse, this facade?

358
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,584
Speaker 0: No, you didn't put effort into it.

359
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:10,627
Speaker 0: You just said a thing.

360
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:14,800
Speaker 0: And then when you found out you were wrong and you just got lucky that there was no evidence of it.

361
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,529
Speaker 0: So you just denied it and rewrote history.

362
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,440
Speaker 1: So, Scott, even were that true?

363
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:23,020
Speaker 0: You know, ever since I was one, I've always known calculus proved that I got.

364
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,244
Speaker 1: I know you didn't in the end.

365
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:27,099
Speaker 1: And the reason I can prove that is you failed calculus three twice.

366
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,147
Speaker 0: I knew calculus one since I was zero.

367
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,050
Speaker 1: Prove I didn't.

368
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,146
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's true.

369
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:34,711
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

370
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:35,597
Speaker 0: It's true.

371
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:35,920
Speaker 0: Right.

372
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,904
Speaker 0: You see how this goes.

373
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:40,340
Speaker 1: I'm just pointing out that you have no proof.

374
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,103
Speaker 1: I'm all.

375
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:43,560
Speaker 1: I have a counter evidence and evidence that I'm not a genius.

376
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,747
Speaker 1: Here's my evidence of character.

377
00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:48,659
Speaker 0: You know, evidence of character.

378
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,672
Speaker 0: The biggest lying does this all the time.

379
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:52,396
Speaker 0: Hundred times.

380
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:53,080
Speaker 0: Everybody knows.

381
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:59,740
Speaker 1: So what you have found in many of the times where you've accused me of lying is that upon review or upon discussion with other that you edited history.

382
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:01,826
Speaker 1: It's not that I ever lie.

383
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:05,760
Speaker 1: It's that I speak with an extreme precision.

384
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:12,160
Speaker 1: And when I am vague on points, I am vague to a very precise point to leave ambiguity.

385
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,569
Speaker 0: On this point, you were not vague.

386
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,800
Speaker 0: You are merely saying what you said.

387
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:19,219
Speaker 0: Now you are post hoc editing what you have said.

388
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:27,700
Speaker 0: If I could have a time machine, you know that the only way to prove otherwise without any doubt is to go with a time machine, which is not possible.

389
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:30,659
Speaker 0: Therefore, you are taking full advantage of that fact, as you often do.

390
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,440
Speaker 0: So I implore to make an argument that, you know, I implore all of our listeners.

391
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,310
Speaker 0: I will just prove that you did not say what I say.

392
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,740
Speaker 0: You said you can't because you don't have a time machine either.

393
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,925
Speaker 1: Listeners, I implore you.

394
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,374
Speaker 1: You know me.

395
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,079
Speaker 0: You do know him.

396
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,691
Speaker 1: You've heard me speak many times.

397
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:46,540
Speaker 0: That's why you know that I'm right.

398
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,469
Speaker 0: And I'm the person who does not lie ever.

399
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,540
Speaker 0: And Rim is the person who lies often.

400
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,081
Speaker 0: Do I not?

401
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:51,883
Speaker 0: This is well known.

402
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:59,480
Speaker 1: Do I not, by instinct, by second nature, qualify my statement such that no one can ever actually find specific fault with them?

403
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:07,700
Speaker 1: Is it not a common thing for me to say things such as, "Well, I believe, I think, I posit, I've heard...".

404
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,039
Speaker 0: In this case, you did not do that.

405
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,140
Speaker 1: But yet, I've done that for almost every assertion I've ever made in my life, except this one.

406
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:15,704
Speaker 0: Have you?

407
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:17,880
Speaker 0: Do we have a time machine to prove that as well?

408
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,255
Speaker 1: So listeners, think back upon previous Geek Nights episodes.

409
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,700
Speaker 1: Go find arguments we've had.

410
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,660
Speaker 0: And go see who is the person who is always truth-telling and who is the person who is always lying.

411
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,457
Speaker 0: Especially in the board game department, Mr.

412
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:30,880
Speaker 0: Character.

413
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:31,798
Speaker 1: Why?

414
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:40,860
Speaker 0: Readily admitting to lying in the board game department and behaving that way and using the same strategies in everyday parlance.

415
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,162
Speaker 1: Is it, in fact, not the opposite?

416
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:50,838
Speaker 1: For is it not my shtick, if you will, if I may, in both small world and mafia to never lie ever?

417
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,479
Speaker 0: It is not your shtick, no.

418
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,540
Speaker 1: Have I ever lied in a game of mafia?

419
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:57,217
Speaker 1: You have.

420
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:57,877
Speaker 1: When?

421
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:00,819
Speaker 0: Do we also need the time machine for this one?

422
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:02,444
Speaker 0: You know what?

423
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:04,756
Speaker 0: I've always lied in every game of mafia.

424
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:05,439
Speaker 0: When?

425
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:09,200
Speaker 1: You didn't play at PAX, so that was the last time we played.

426
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,462
Speaker 1: Right?

427
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:09,945
Speaker 0: When was it?

428
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:10,207
Speaker 0: Right?

429
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:10,710
Speaker 0: Okay.

430
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,120
Speaker 0: Anyway.

431
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,340
Speaker 1: So I'm glad we're clear.

432
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,300
Speaker 0: Do we have any meta moments available?

433
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,522
Speaker 1: That I'm right.

434
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:20,280
Speaker 1: The Geek Nights Book Club, the next book will be announced if Scott's picked this up.

435
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,378
Speaker 0: It'll be announced right now.

436
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:21,957
Speaker 1: Okay.

437
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:23,915
Speaker 0: So I gotta tell the story of this book club.

438
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:24,420
Speaker 0: It'll take a minute.

439
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,080
Speaker 0: So I was reading the Penny Arcade print editions, which I highly recommend because they contain additional commentaries.

440
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:31,737
Speaker 0: That they do.

441
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:32,859
Speaker 0: And many other goodies.

442
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,840
Speaker 0: You should buy them for cheap on Amazon.

443
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:42,120
Speaker 0: And the introduction to one of the later volumes was written by a man named Patrick Rothfuss.

444
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,138
Speaker 0: And I was like, who the hell is this guy?

445
00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:47,200
Speaker 0: And he basically talked all about how he was writing some fantasy novel.

446
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:48,420
Speaker 0: And I'm like, oh, whatever.

447
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,860
Speaker 0: Some guy wrote fantasy novels right in the forward for some Penny Arcade volume.

448
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:53,377
Speaker 0: All right.

449
00:20:54,201 --> 00:21:00,280
Speaker 0: And then I look into this guy and apparently he's the hot new fantasy guy on the block, relatively speaking.

450
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:01,777
Speaker 0: That means, you know, a year or two.

451
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,337
Speaker 0: Right.

452
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:04,094
Speaker 0: As opposed to 10, 20 years.

453
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:08,720
Speaker 0: And a lot of people are reading his book all over the place.

454
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,780
Speaker 0: So I bought it, but I didn't read it yet.

455
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,360
Speaker 0: It's just been sitting there on the shelf and my new policy for book club is pick the book that's on the shelf that I haven't read yet.

456
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,598
Speaker 0: So I don't have to buy new books.

457
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:21,900
Speaker 0: Therefore, the next.

458
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,820
Speaker 0: And also, I heard some people commentate on this book saying that it ends in sort of an air place.

459
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:29,580
Speaker 0: But the sequel, I believe, is now available.

460
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,239
Speaker 0: So if you were only going to do this first book.

461
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:37,860
Speaker 0: But, you know, if you feel you're hanging at the end of it, you are no longer stuck waiting for a book to be published.

462
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:40,119
Speaker 0: You can go buy another one or download another one.

463
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:42,810
Speaker 0: So the book is.

464
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,400
Speaker 0: I forget the exact title.

465
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:49,439
Speaker 0: I think is it the name of the wind or in the name of the wind?

466
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:54,440
Speaker 1: It is Children Who Chase Lost Wind Through Voices Deep Below.

467
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, something along those lines.

468
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:58,720
Speaker 0: It is the name of the wind.

469
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,300
Speaker 0: King Killer Chronicles Day one by Patrick Rothfuss.

470
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,640
Speaker 0: And it is eleven dollars and fifty six cents in paper version.

471
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:13,940
Speaker 0: And the sequel is The Wise Man's Fear, which is King Killer Chronicles Day two.

472
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:16,219
Speaker 0: I suppose it's about a guy who kills the king.

473
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,020
Speaker 0: And in fact, the paperback of the second volume is cheaper than the paperback of the first one.

474
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:24,879
Speaker 1: One, two, three syllabolism of that.

475
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:27,860
Speaker 1: Just I find it ridiculously hilarious.

476
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,180
Speaker 1: King Killer Chronicles.

477
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:30,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

478
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:36,720
Speaker 0: So, yeah, the name of the wind, a book that I do not know if is good or bad, but I have it.

479
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:38,839
Speaker 0: So I don't want to have my money wasted.

480
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:40,479
Speaker 0: So that's going to be the booklet.

481
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:40,941
Speaker 0: All right.

482
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:44,660
Speaker 1: The next one after that will probably be The Great Gatsby because I want to read it before the movie happens.

483
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm definitely in favor of the class.

484
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,560
Speaker 0: That's what I'm going to do when I run out of books on my bookshelf that are physical.

485
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,240
Speaker 0: I almost want to make because I'm probably not going to buy too many more of those.

486
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,300
Speaker 0: I'm going to move over to the classics I haven't read.

487
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:01,980
Speaker 1: The trouble is I every time I would rather do a work of nonfiction, but I know that none of you assholes will read it.

488
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,441
Speaker 1: That's right.

489
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:12,499
Speaker 1: But I almost for the sake of the fact that it's so important to gaming, I feel like I should almost make the book club book that Richard Garfield book anyway.

490
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:21,200
Speaker 0: But yeah, I figured, you know, this time I also want to concentrate more on the fact that, you know, it is the book club, but it's the geek night's book club.

491
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,819
Speaker 0: We should leans at least slightly more towards the fantasy sci fi.

492
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,808
Speaker 0: Now why is the geek night's book club?

493
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:29,380
Speaker 1: as in we are geeks, not nerds.

494
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:33,640
Speaker 1: I am just as geeky about rock climbing and mountain biking as I am about video gaming.

495
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,920
Speaker 0: I'm just saying I'm going to, you know, at least my the shelf of unread.

496
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,911
Speaker 1: Besides, you want to go geeky?

497
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:38,540
Speaker 1: All right, fine.

498
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,720
Speaker 1: That Byzantine bullshit I've been reading is going to be the next book club.

499
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,479
Speaker 1: That's eight hundred pages of the driest history you've ever read.

500
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,500
Speaker 0: If it's your pick, you can pick whatever you want.

501
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,079
Speaker 0: Why don't you pick that Peter the Great book that no one will be able to get a copy of?

502
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,474
Speaker 1: I've read almost that entire book.

503
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:56,200
Speaker 1: You know what?

504
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,692
Speaker 1: The wars between Sweden and Russia.

505
00:23:58,712 --> 00:23:59,779
Speaker 1: Hilarious.

506
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,482
Speaker 0: Not really.

507
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:06,500
Speaker 1: They're hilarious from the perspective of if you treat those wars like advanced wars.

508
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,939
Speaker 0: So we have to remember to actually update all the book club section on the website.

509
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:10,890
Speaker 1: Yeah.

510
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:11,054
Speaker 1: Yeah.

511
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,340
Speaker 1: So, so the man who was Thursday.

512
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,534
Speaker 0: So this is your selection.

513
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:17,615
Speaker 0: Yup.

514
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,840
Speaker 0: Explain why it was chosen and what you heard about it.

515
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,780
Speaker 1: So I had chosen literally I was going to choose between the Great Gatsby because the movie's coming.

516
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,924
Speaker 1: That looks actually really good.

517
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,680
Speaker 1: And I've never read the Great Gatsby and the man who was Thursday.

518
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,245
Speaker 1: And I don't recall.

519
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:35,500
Speaker 1: I might have said when I announced it why I noticed the man who was Thursday.

520
00:24:35,862 --> 00:24:37,900
Speaker 1: But it was called to my attention by something.

521
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:45,040
Speaker 1: And upon it being called my intention, I remembered in Deus Ex something that sounded similar.

522
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,639
Speaker 1: And sure enough, this book is quoted in Deus Ex.

523
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,646
Speaker 1: So there's a little bit of a nerdy tie.

524
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:57,679
Speaker 1: And one of our listeners said something to the effect of, my dad says this is a great book and he's always tried to get me to read it.

525
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:00,379
Speaker 1: And the dad, as I've met him, is pretty nerdy.

526
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:03,080
Speaker 1: So all these things together, I decided, you know what?

527
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:05,300
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll check this book out and make it the book club book.

528
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:14,110
Speaker 1: And when I looked at what it was about, obviously spoilers if you get from this point forward, if you guys haven't read the book, but at the same time, it's fucking book club.

529
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,219
Speaker 0: I mean, what the fuck, guys?

530
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:22,440
Speaker 1: If you didn't read this book, it'd probably be okay to listen to this episode because it'll spoil everything.

531
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,845
Speaker 1: But you know what?

532
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:27,660
Speaker 1: This is not about to be spoiled because the premise is the only big spoiler.

533
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:29,343
Speaker 1: And I read the premise.

534
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:35,580
Speaker 1: The premise was, as you know, that you've got a bunch of anarchists out there trying to ruin the world.

535
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:36,739
Speaker 1: And you've got a cop.

536
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,739
Speaker 0: Well, if you believe that anarchy is ruining the world.

537
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:40,700
Speaker 0: You might like an anarchist world.

538
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:40,880
Speaker 0: Yeah.

539
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,702
Speaker 1: And the book gets into that.

540
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:48,880
Speaker 1: So you've got a cop and the cop infiltrates the anarchists and gets elected to the anarchist council because he's a better proponent of anarchism than the real anarchists.

541
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,807
Speaker 0: How could anarchists have a council?

542
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:54,200
Speaker 0: Isn't the very mere existence of a council contrary to anarchy?

543
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:55,738
Speaker 1: So I realized.

544
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:58,479
Speaker 0: And in fact, they bring that up in the book.

545
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,580
Speaker 1: This book that it is, in fact, a comedy.

546
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:02,406
Speaker 1: Yeah.

547
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:03,077
Speaker 0: No kidding.

548
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:06,780
Speaker 1: And that I actually really enjoyed it from that perspective.

549
00:26:07,563 --> 00:26:08,839
Speaker 0: But there were funny parts.

550
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:12,073
Speaker 1: But yeah, now the funniest part in the entire book is Dr.

551
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:13,540
Speaker 1: Bull is my favorite character.

552
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Speaker 1: It's pretty good because he is the one whenever everything goes to shit.

553
00:26:18,163 --> 00:26:19,576
Speaker 1: He is always the one who was like, fuck it.

554
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:21,027
Speaker 1: It's over.

555
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:21,899
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit.

556
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,670
Speaker 1: You guys suck.

557
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,119
Speaker 1: It's done.

558
00:26:23,423 --> 00:26:25,040
Speaker 1: Or he'll laugh or do something funny.

559
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,879
Speaker 1: And there's one scene that really stuck out in my mind.

560
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,220
Speaker 1: Remember when they think that the anarchists are chasing them down to murder them because the entire world is broken.

561
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,439
Speaker 0: And there's like two or three.

562
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,419
Speaker 0: There's two or three chapters of chase scene.

563
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:37,119
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

564
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,319
Speaker 1: There's the longest chase ever.

565
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:38,881
Speaker 0: Right.

566
00:26:39,323 --> 00:26:44,920
Speaker 1: Well, no, I think the the the the chase after that with the hot air balloon is probably the best.

567
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:48,680
Speaker 0: It is basically the same chase, as far as I'm concerned, with a slight intermission.

568
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:52,880
Speaker 1: So the or an intermezzo, the fake anarchists are chasing them and they're trying to get away.

569
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,100
Speaker 1: And then they finally are going to fight and whatever.

570
00:26:55,621 --> 00:27:00,080
Speaker 1: And they run up and he hits the guy with that lantern and he pulls out the sword and all the bullshit.

571
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:00,423
Speaker 1: Dr.

572
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:01,599
Speaker 1: Bull's standing there with the sword.

573
00:27:01,942 --> 00:27:03,498
Speaker 1: And then the guy's like, I'm a cop.

574
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,148
Speaker 1: And as soon as he says that, Dr.

575
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:10,380
Speaker 1: Bull, there's it's just there's a part like there's a break.

576
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:12,540
Speaker 1: And the next paragraph is one sentence.

577
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,986
Speaker 1: And all it says is Dr.

578
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,819
Speaker 1: Bull threw his sword into the sea.

579
00:27:17,842 --> 00:27:21,740
Speaker 1: And I just picture him being like, oh, fuck, throwing it like everything.

580
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:27,394
Speaker 1: And that I actually laughed out loud at that scene because Dr.

581
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,079
Speaker 1: Bull reacts to everything like that.

582
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,718
Speaker 1: Just I picture him thinking is that for the love of God.

583
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,671
Speaker 0: Do you remember which day the week he was?

584
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:35,920
Speaker 1: I do not.

585
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,728
Speaker 0: Not or neither.

586
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:37,720
Speaker 0: I hardly remember.

587
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:42,397
Speaker 0: I also don't really remember much of the days of the week, guys, other than Dr.

588
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:42,498
Speaker 1: Bull.

589
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,985
Speaker 0: Well, this Dr.

590
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:45,520
Speaker 0: Bull is the first guy.

591
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,400
Speaker 1: I remember more about the colonel, the French guy, Delacroix or whatever.

592
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,023
Speaker 0: All right.

593
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,320
Speaker 0: And that's the guy he duels with, right?

594
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:55,960
Speaker 0: The French guy, because he has to go doesn't he go to France for the duel?

595
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,299
Speaker 1: But he also has his two French friends who are helping him.

596
00:27:59,481 --> 00:27:59,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

597
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,780
Speaker 1: And all that business.

598
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:03,840
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, yeah, they're all cops.

599
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,604
Speaker 1: Everyone's a cop.

600
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:07,239
Speaker 1: Everyone in this whole thing's a cop, except Sunday, who I think is God.

601
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:10,560
Speaker 1: So what do you think of this book?

602
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,100
Speaker 0: I mean, on the one hand, right.

603
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:19,800
Speaker 0: You know, the premise was actually, you know, considering how long ago this is written and considering that, you know, I was surprised.

604
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,300
Speaker 0: I'm like, huh, I can't think of anything recent that sort of stole this really clever premise.

605
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,941
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, this book is written in 1908.

606
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:31,060
Speaker 0: Right, you would think, you know, something like this would have been stolen and redone a hundred times.

607
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:40,878
Speaker 0: So the fact that it wasn't sort of made that, you know, that idea that, you know, this guy's undercover, but actually everyone else is also undercover and on his side, but they don't, no one knows it.

608
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,345
Speaker 0: It's like, that's so clever.

609
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:44,780
Speaker 0: How come nobody's reused that or stolen it?

610
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:50,360
Speaker 0: And it's like, man, that, you know, just that fact alone sort of is what really makes the book kind of cool.

611
00:28:53,082 --> 00:29:05,180
Speaker 0: But there was also, I kind of liked, you know, a lot of the, you know, symbolic things that were going on in the book, especially the sort of trippy stuff like towards the end, where they've all got the costumes on and the different days of the week.

612
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:07,156
Speaker 1: So two interesting points.

613
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:07,440
Speaker 1: One.

614
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,160
Speaker 0: Because I like trippy shit like that.

615
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:12,680
Speaker 1: I did the sort of like middle school level literary analysis through.

616
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,160
Speaker 1: I didn't really engage too deeply because I didn't care that much.

617
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:17,884
Speaker 1: But obviously this is a book.

618
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:24,460
Speaker 1: if like I could picture any like mid, like eighth grader being assigned this book and having to write papers on the symbolism within it.

619
00:29:25,381 --> 00:29:42,780
Speaker 1: But I literally completely did not in any way pick up on the seven days of creation Christian symbolism until the very end when they were like, when one of the characters, like, he's like this costume, how does this match Thursday?

620
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,603
Speaker 1: This is stupid.

621
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:48,660
Speaker 1: And the guy's like, uh, Thursday's when X and Y were created in the seven days.

622
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,612
Speaker 1: The main characters like, oh, I also.

623
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:53,420
Speaker 0: I also did not pick up on that.

624
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,860
Speaker 0: I was thinking more during the whole book up until that point.

625
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,777
Speaker 0: I was thinking along the lines of, well, it's Thor's day.

626
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:00,280
Speaker 0: Right.

627
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,257
Speaker 0: And the origins of the name, you know, the it since it didn't fit.

628
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:04,940
Speaker 0: Right.

629
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,520
Speaker 0: I was like, well, I was, you know, where the names of the days come from is the kind of thing I was trying to match.

630
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,718
Speaker 1: Do you know where all the days come from?

631
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,720
Speaker 0: I looked up some of them that I didn't know.

632
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,608
Speaker 1: You know what Tuesday is?

633
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:16,960
Speaker 1: I won a fucking quiz ball competition with that shit.

634
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,564
Speaker 0: All right.

635
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:18,940
Speaker 0: Well, what is it, quiz ball man?

636
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,008
Speaker 0: Okay, so Thursday is Thor's day.

637
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:22,194
Speaker 1: Tuesday is Tyr's day.

638
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:23,560
Speaker 1: Tyr is a different Norse god.

639
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,331
Speaker 1: So you know how I won this quiz ball?

640
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:27,679
Speaker 1: This was a...

641
00:30:28,642 --> 00:30:29,938
Speaker 0: Tyr, you kind of mumbled it.

642
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,306
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't the name.

643
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:34,052
Speaker 1: three elements that begin with H thing.

644
00:30:34,252 --> 00:30:34,693
Speaker 0: Okay.

645
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:36,660
Speaker 1: Helium, hydrogen and...

646
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:38,617
Speaker 0: Helium.

647
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,840
Speaker 1: So basically it was like, nor it was like Norse mythology.

648
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:46,604
Speaker 1: It wasn't.

649
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:49,380
Speaker 1: the topic was something like week, like days and months.

650
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:56,380
Speaker 1: And it was like the, it was me alone against this other guy, like a one-on-one, like one guy from each team went up and did like these 20 questions.

651
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:57,582
Speaker 1: Yeah.

652
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:02,780
Speaker 1: So it was all like, they would name a month or a day or something.

653
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:06,339
Speaker 1: And you have to buzz in and say what it like, what the etymological origin of that was.

654
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:08,329
Speaker 1: And it was like Thursday, I was like Thor.

655
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:08,992
Speaker 1: And that was like, yes.

656
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,460
Speaker 1: And you know, I'm going through just fine.

657
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:11,566
Speaker 1: This is Tuesday.

658
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:12,211
Speaker 1: And I didn't know.

659
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:13,299
Speaker 1: the other guy didn't know shit.

660
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:18,600
Speaker 1: So I'm just sitting there and I'm like, ah, and I just figured I'd buzzing because I didn't matter as I buzzed in.

661
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:22,500
Speaker 1: And I said, Tyr, because Tyr is Norse god.

662
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,619
Speaker 1: Also, you know why I knew Tyr?

663
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,443
Speaker 0: Begins with T?

664
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:28,860
Speaker 1: No, Tyr is in Forgotten Realms.

665
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,344
Speaker 0: I was going to say D&D.

666
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:36,940
Speaker 1: He is one of the Norse gods who fled when that pantheon, like pantheon fell apart to live in Forgotten Realms gods.

667
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:38,319
Speaker 0: That's T-Y-R-E-T.

668
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:39,110
Speaker 0: No, just T-Y-R.

669
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:40,359
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

670
00:31:41,002 --> 00:31:43,700
Speaker 1: So I just said that and it was right.

671
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:44,335
Speaker 0: Yeah.

672
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,430
Speaker 1: And I, and everyone was like, how'd you know that?

673
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,200
Speaker 1: And I was like, cause I'm a genius, of course.

674
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:48,878
Speaker 0: Nerd, anyway.

675
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
Speaker 0: I know everything about Norse mythology.

676
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,621
Speaker 0: Right.

677
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:56,400
Speaker 0: And anyway, the Norse gods did not match up in any meaningful way with the different dudes and their, their personalities or anything.

678
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,178
Speaker 0: So I was just like, oh.

679
00:31:58,006 --> 00:31:59,839
Speaker 1: But what, what's interesting is what this does.

680
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:09,280
Speaker 1: It really illustrates that the place and time that a work is written can often be very fixed, not just in terms of understanding the story, but in terms of one's interpretation.

681
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:12,939
Speaker 1: Anyone in 1908 reading this would have been very Bible-y.

682
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,040
Speaker 1: Would have just, even if they weren't religious, they at least knew the Bible and would think about the Bible.

683
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,459
Speaker 0: If you're a literate book reading person at that time.

684
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,699
Speaker 1: So works from that era, you would just assume that seven days, all right, there's probably a Bible metaphor going on.

685
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,820
Speaker 1: But note how in the book, none of the characters picked up on that.

686
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,899
Speaker 1: And they were surprised when it was pointed out to them.

687
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:38,600
Speaker 1: But it is referenced several times throughout the book that none of them know what's in the Bible.

688
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,740
Speaker 1: None of them are religious.

689
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:40,198
Speaker 0: Yep.

690
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:48,640
Speaker 1: Even though Syme beats the guy over the head with that religious lantern and talks about how important that cross is.

691
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,400
Speaker 1: But he's never actually read the Bible.

692
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,687
Speaker 0: So, uh, what you read?

693
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:54,640
Speaker 0: the free edition from the internet project Gutenberg.

694
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,004
Speaker 1: Yep.

695
00:32:55,086 --> 00:32:55,417
Speaker 1: It was okay.

696
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:55,841
Speaker 0: All right.

697
00:32:55,881 --> 00:33:01,900
Speaker 0: Did that have a, an introduction that was written by, who is the introduction written by?

698
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,600
Speaker 1: No, no introduction.

699
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,101
Speaker 0: Okay.

700
00:33:04,403 --> 00:33:06,680
Speaker 0: Did that have footnotes in the back?

701
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,660
Speaker 0: See, I bought, I purchased the Penguin Classics edition for a handful of reasons.

702
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,118
Speaker 0: Reason number one, smells so good.

703
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:17,560
Speaker 0: Reason number two, the cover is amazing.

704
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,080
Speaker 0: And there's all these police just all over the place beating up on people in this pretty good art style.

705
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:32,660
Speaker 0: And reason number three, which I didn't know until I got it is as this awesome appendix and footnotes and things like that, which were incredibly helpful because there's things that you wouldn't know.

706
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,362
Speaker 0: Have basically there's no chance.

707
00:33:34,503 --> 00:33:42,816
Speaker 0: even a super educated, well-read person, unless you were kind of like a literary person, you know, with this kind of expertise, you would not know any of this shit.

708
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,120
Speaker 0: that was, you know, only relevant at the time.

709
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:49,860
Speaker 0: Um, and it, you know, it tells you like what certain words mean and things like that.

710
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,260
Speaker 0: And it was super helpful while reading the book, but some of the things that they were trying to explain were just kind of weird.

711
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,705
Speaker 0: Like, it's like, really?

712
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:01,371
Speaker 0: It's like Strasburg pie.

713
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:02,033
Speaker 0: It's a pie.

714
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:04,120
Speaker 0: It's a pate made with fatty goose livers.

715
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:12,760
Speaker 0: For example, it was reported the young man in the diplomatic service at Pumpernickel pick crawl used to bring home dispatches consisting of Strasburg pie to the foreign minister of the day.

716
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,739
Speaker 0: And it's like, what?

717
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:21,060
Speaker 0: What the fuck does that have to do with, you know, I'm sure they mentioned like Strasburg pie in some sentence somewhere.

718
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:25,080
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, why is Strasburg pie, you know, relevant at all?

719
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Speaker 0: But the one thing that was relevant was the thing about the the the a subs fable about the pig.

720
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:35,920
Speaker 1: And here that was a good part because that tactic of debate was brought.

721
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,540
Speaker 1: I took an argumentation class at RIT was literally argumentation and debate.

722
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:42,319
Speaker 1: And we talked about that technique at length.

723
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:44,545
Speaker 0: So let me let me find this.

724
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:48,280
Speaker 0: I just want to find the relevant passage in the actual book that it was referencing.

725
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,928
Speaker 0: Page sixty five.

726
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:53,320
Speaker 0: Footnote number eight.

727
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:58,220
Speaker 0: I should have done this before the show started.

728
00:34:59,023 --> 00:35:00,799
Speaker 0: But I didn't think of it until just now.

729
00:35:01,481 --> 00:35:01,901
Speaker 1: Come on.

730
00:35:02,202 --> 00:35:02,403
Speaker 1: All right.

731
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:03,625
Speaker 1: So my other favorite Dr.

732
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:10,360
Speaker 1: Bull moment is toward the very end when the one guy keeps being like they're all like talking about Sunday.

733
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:12,474
Speaker 1: Like he's like a god like the world.

734
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:13,400
Speaker 1: He's like pan.

735
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,847
Speaker 1: And the one guy keeps being like, just like pan.

736
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:17,071
Speaker 1: And finally, Dr.

737
00:35:17,111 --> 00:35:20,000
Speaker 1: Bull is like, you seem to think pan is everything.

738
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,541
Speaker 1: Shut it.

739
00:35:20,641 --> 00:35:23,268
Speaker 0: All right.

740
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:24,110
Speaker 0: So here here comes.

741
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,065
Speaker 0: OK, so he's like, what's going on?

742
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:28,090
Speaker 0: I don't have the context.

743
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,970
Speaker 0: But basically the guy says, I see he sneered.

744
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,390
Speaker 0: You prevail like the false pig in Aesop and you fail.

745
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,930
Speaker 0: I answered, smiling like the hedgehog in Montaigne.

746
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,769
Speaker 0: Need I say there is no hedgehog in Montaigne.

747
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,782
Speaker 0: Or a claptrap comes off, he said.

748
00:35:42,803 --> 00:35:43,849
Speaker 0: So would your beard.

749
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:49,370
Speaker 0: I had no intelligent answer to this, which is quite true and rather witty, but I laughed heartily.

750
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,310
Speaker 0: Answered like the pantheist boots.

751
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,370
Speaker 0: So in the footnotes, it says the false pig in Aesop.

752
00:35:54,990 --> 00:36:07,530
Speaker 0: Probably a nonsense formulation, though in his edition, Stephen Medcalf, I guess he made an edition of Aesop's Fables, identifies the phrase with the fable of the buffoon and the countryman, actually by Phaedrus.

753
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:23,770
Speaker 0: But ascribed to him, ascribed by him to Aesop, a buffoon at a theater imitated a pig squeak so perfectly that the audience insisted he must have a pig hidden about his person, but applauded him definitely when he convinced them he had not.

754
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,790
Speaker 0: A countryman claimed he could do better and made a pig, which he had beneath his smock squeak.

755
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:35,230
Speaker 0: The audience unanimously declared that the buffoons imitation was much more true to life.

756
00:36:37,871 --> 00:36:42,489
Speaker 0: The countryman producing the pig says that shows what sort of judges you are.

757
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,219
Speaker 0: In 1912, Chesterton provided the introduction to V.S.

758
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:49,830
Speaker 0: Vernon Jones' translation of Aesop's Fables, illustrated by Arthur Rackham.

759
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,031
Speaker 0: There, he insisted.

760
00:36:51,052 --> 00:37:01,030
Speaker 0: in contrast to fairy tales, fables like those through which Aesop was famously was famous are premised on the idea that everything is itself and will in any case speak for itself.

761
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,880
Speaker 0: The wolf will always be wolfish.

762
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,309
Speaker 0: The fox will always be foxy.

763
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:09,730
Speaker 0: According to this theory, the idea of a false pig is completely incompatible with Aesop, right?

764
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:17,446
Speaker 0: So in Aesop's Fables, a fox would always be foxy, but in this fable, right, you know, things were not as they seem.

765
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,150
Speaker 0: Therefore, it was not an Aesop's Fable.

766
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:39,376
Speaker 0: I just thought, you know, that's the kind of crazy and interesting stuff that was going on here, and I don't remember the context of that weird passage, but when I- That's right!

767
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,430
Speaker 0: Oh, that was actually one of my favorite parts.

768
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:46,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the scholar's quoting, like, he's making real witticisms, and the guy's just like, "Well,

769
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:46,790
Speaker 1: la-di-da!"

770
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,411
Speaker 1: Exactly.

771
00:37:47,611 --> 00:38:02,810
Speaker 0: One of the cops is, you know, impersonates this anarchist scholar, and he impersonates him so well that then what happens is the actual scholar is- gets sort of cast out because they think he's the imposter.

772
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:13,050
Speaker 0: So he is like the pig in this fable by Phaedrus, right, to where he's the real scholar, but everyone believes the imposter is the real deal because he's better than the- right?

773
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:27,730
Speaker 0: So, and the fact that Chesterton wrote an introduction to a collection of Aesop's Fables, I think he knew also that it was the false pig of Phaedrus and not of Aesop, and wrote that on purpose, and shows you what's going on there.

774
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:31,410
Speaker 1: Add some Hamlet level, uh, I'm crazy, check it out.

775
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

776
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:45,870
Speaker 1: This book, if nothing, when I read it, I think the reason a lot of people think back to it is, one, the premise is great, even though the book itself, not that entertaining, really, except as a comedy, but it is eminently quotable.

777
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:59,670
Speaker 1: Like, if you want something somewhat witty and a little bit lengthy with some references to quote that is relevant to a lot of modern society, the characters are just rife with them, and I think that's why it's quoted in a bunch of stuff.

778
00:39:01,434 --> 00:39:01,715
Speaker 0: Yeah.

779
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:03,843
Speaker 0: Can you guys- do you see a page of quotes there?

780
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,670
Speaker 0: Do you want to rattle them off of hilarity?

781
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,855
Speaker 1: Well, this isn't really- this is just something a character said.

782
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:11,042
Speaker 1: He said, "Your offer is far too idiotic to be

783
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:11,644
Speaker 1: declined.".

784
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:14,150
Speaker 1: I actually really like that one.

785
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:19,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the kind of thing that you can use in everyday speaking, if you could be that witty, you know?

786
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:27,050
Speaker 0: But yeah, my biggest problem with this book is that just the pacing was so crazy, and- The action scenes are unparsable.

787
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:35,703
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was- everything was moving so rapidly, and yet sometimes so slowly, it's like they would pretty much, like, teleport almost.

788
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:39,990
Speaker 0: It's like, "Okay, they're talking in London, and they're in France having a

789
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,250
Speaker 0: duel.".

790
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:49,050
Speaker 0: And it's like, they didn't really just, you know, it's like, they didn't sort of ease into a train trip or anything like that, or the boat, it's just like, BAM!

791
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,990
Speaker 0: And suddenly they're dueling in France, and you didn't even realize they're in France unless you're reading really, really carefully.

792
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:04,010
Speaker 0: And then, especially those two chase scenes toward the end, it's pretty much like, whoosh, they're in a car, whoosh, they're somewhere, whoosh, there's a million people chasing them, where do they come from so quickly?

793
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:11,144
Speaker 1: Yeah, like when the anarchists are chasing them, it's like, there's an army now, and again, those guys are stupid too, they're like, "Hey, there's a bunch of guys over there.

794
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:13,668
Speaker 1: I guess the entire world has risen up in

795
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:14,210
Speaker 1: anarchy.".

796
00:40:14,754 --> 00:40:15,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, what?

797
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,569
Speaker 1: Let's go to the police station, they'll help us.

798
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:27,310
Speaker 0: And it's like, by the time they're at the police station, the town's being overrun, and it's like, two paragraphs ago, you were just chilling at some dude's house, asking him for his car.

799
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:33,908
Speaker 1: And the weird things that happened, like, when the one guy produces a lantern in the car, and they're like, "Where'd you get that

800
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:34,329
Speaker 1: lantern?".

801
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,125
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Oh, the guy just ripped it out of the ceiling for me, smashed two of his vases on the

802
00:40:39,165 --> 00:40:39,425
Speaker 1: way.".

803
00:40:39,446 --> 00:40:40,128
Speaker 1: And they're like,

804
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:40,429
Speaker 1: "What?".

805
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:51,930
Speaker 0: It's like, why didn't you show that when it happened, instead of, it feels like someone is writing this with ink and didn't have word processor, so they didn't want to go back and write in the smashing scene, so he put it in later.

806
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:56,690
Speaker 1: They were a little cartoony, like the chase scene in Kung Fu Hustle.

807
00:40:57,813 --> 00:40:59,389
Speaker 0: I think even crazier and harder to follow.

808
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:07,970
Speaker 1: Well, especially, there's a scene where the guy, early on, that's chasing him, the old man, but always appears right behind him, very Pinkie Pie style.

809
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:14,510
Speaker 1: But there's also the scene when they're chasing Sunday, and he's like, throwing notes at them, and just sticking around with it.

810
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:20,027
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, that's the kind of stuff that you see in a Babar cartoon, or Babar, right?

811
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:21,110
Speaker 0: That just shit makes no sense.

812
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,860
Speaker 1: But here's what I really want to say about this book.

813
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,730
Speaker 1: I think it was enjoyable to read, but not super enjoyable.

814
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:29,374
Speaker 1: But, I'm glad I read it.

815
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:36,270
Speaker 1: More importantly, this is a story that really, really needs a loose interpretation.

816
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:43,970
Speaker 1: Like, a movie or a comic that is not very, kind of like how Robocop the movie, was not very true to the original idea.

817
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,750
Speaker 1: And yet it was better because of it.

818
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,090
Speaker 0: There was something before Robocop the movie?

819
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,390
Speaker 1: Well, the original conception for Robocop was very different from what Robocop became.

820
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,469
Speaker 0: But it wasn't a book.

821
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,972
Speaker 1: Fine, Total Recall.

822
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:56,540
Speaker 1: Total Recall, the story is one thing.

823
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,110
Speaker 1: The movie, the Arnold one, was actually way different.

824
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,054
Speaker 1: But it, on its own, was really good.

825
00:42:04,114 --> 00:42:15,530
Speaker 1: This is that kind of story where, if you just take the events, and the core idea, and interpret it loosely, and do something cool with it, it would make a fantastic and hilarious comedy.

826
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:26,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the number one thing you have to do, right, is the whole first few chapters where, other than the first one, where he discovers that every single other person is a cop, slowly but surely, one at a time.

827
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:33,349
Speaker 0: It's like, after the second or third one, when you go up to the fourth guy, you gotta be like, "Alright, we know you're a cop,

828
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:33,670
Speaker 0: right?".

829
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:38,730
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, you wouldn't even be, you'd just assume everyone else is one at that point, because it's too crazy.

830
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,830
Speaker 0: The three are, the first three you came across were all cops, and you still assume the rest aren't.

831
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:44,310
Speaker 1: But the characters!

832
00:42:44,491 --> 00:42:44,913
Speaker 0: All of them.

833
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:48,290
Speaker 0: but the last one are cops, and you still assume the last one isn't.

834
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:54,950
Speaker 1: Well, this is my trouble, Syme was brilliant most of the time, but he was stupid in this one regard.

835
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,207
Speaker 1: He would just, he'd find, he's like, "Oh, I guess there were five cops out of

836
00:42:59,308 --> 00:42:59,629
Speaker 1: seven.".

837
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:06,750
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, no, no, no, after number three or four, it's like, I'm assuming the rest are cops, right, before I assume they're anarchists.

838
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:13,470
Speaker 0: Because, if it's, even if it was three out of seven, what are the odds that you picked the first three out of seven?

839
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:15,490
Speaker 1: Also, it's the game of Mafia.

840
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:16,710
Speaker 0: Exactly.

841
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:18,172
Speaker 0: Kind of.

842
00:43:18,212 --> 00:43:22,850
Speaker 0: You wanna make a Mafia game that is themed on Man Who Was Thursday?

843
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,910
Speaker 1: It would be a Mafia-like, it would not be a Mafia game, it wouldn't be Mafia.

844
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,260
Speaker 0: You draw a card, it says Sunday.

845
00:43:27,281 --> 00:43:27,946
Speaker 0: on it, you're like, "Fuck

846
00:43:27,966 --> 00:43:28,188
Speaker 0: yeah!".

847
00:43:29,554 --> 00:43:30,308
Speaker 1: I don't know how it would work.

848
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:31,848
Speaker 0: Well, come up with it.

849
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,709
Speaker 1: Well, no, I gotta come up with my 25 shitty games first.

850
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:38,010
Speaker 1: The one I'm working on right now, it's Bumway Cars.

851
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,790
Speaker 1: It's placing bums on platforms, and then into trains, and then you have your guys trying to avoid the bums.

852
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:43,231
Speaker 0: Right.

853
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:53,270
Speaker 0: But anyway, if you did this, if you interpreted this into a movie or something like that, you would have to somehow make it believable that they really, really believe that everyone else was an anarchist.

854
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,730
Speaker 1: Or, you'd have to make it, you'd have to really play it up as a sort of farcical comedy.

855
00:43:57,999 --> 00:43:58,168
Speaker 1: Yeah.

856
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,686
Speaker 1: Which could still be done, I mean, like I said, I laughed out loud several times at Dr.

857
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:03,910
Speaker 1: Bull reacting to things.

858
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:15,230
Speaker 1: Yes, there's also the whole bomb plot at the beginning, which is like- Yeah, the bomb plot was fine until they had the duel, and as readers, we knew the other guy was a cop.

859
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:20,589
Speaker 1: And yet he, and like, I don't understand what his plan was.

860
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:28,030
Speaker 1: If he was a cop and didn't want to set off the bomb, why was he trying desperately to win the duel to go set off the bomb?

861
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:28,511
Speaker 0: Yep.

862
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:33,630
Speaker 0: And meanwhile, while there's a whole bunch of the people coming out to chase them, why were they running away?

863
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,990
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, that's the point where they got caught up with and the chases began right after the duel.

864
00:44:39,974 --> 00:44:41,710
Speaker 0: So, it's like, you could just let them catch.

865
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:52,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta say though, I like Gregory, because he is- I think he's definitely the most- When Greg, that scene in the beginning when he loses the debate, he is the angriest a Gregory has ever been.

866
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:53,248
Speaker 0: Ever been.

867
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:55,150
Speaker 1: He is so angry.

868
00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:02,770
Speaker 0: That, I think that was actually probably, you know, that very beginning was like, you know, more well paced and well written than the rest of the book.

869
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:09,490
Speaker 0: I think it's like, he had this huge idea, he had the perfect set up, and then the rest of it was much looser, but that- I don't think he knew where to go with it either.

870
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, but those opening one or two chapters with the whole, the set up, were pretty great.

871
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,690
Speaker 0: If the whole rest of it had been as good as that set up, it would have been awesome.

872
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:25,088
Speaker 1: So, random aside, but I, every time Sunday was described, I could not help but picture the leader from 1Q84.

873
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,390
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a good- Because they were both described the same way.

874
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:30,250
Speaker 0: Sort of similar.

875
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:38,530
Speaker 1: I imagine the leader from- Their bulk and their movement, specifically when they describe the way the leader moves, is the same as the way this guy moves.

876
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:44,067
Speaker 0: But I imagined, the thing is, I imagined them also very similarly, and I actually did think about the leader from 1Q84, right?

877
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:54,610
Speaker 0: But I imagine the leader in 1Q84 as being taller and thinner, whereas I imagined Sunday, because he was so, being more square, like the kingpin from Marvel comics.

878
00:45:54,972 --> 00:45:56,489
Speaker 0: True, but- Like a big square guy.

879
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:03,590
Speaker 0: But in QT84- Which was kind of crazy for the chase scene, because he was running away, but he was immensely fat.

880
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,494
Speaker 1: Oh, that happened all the time.

881
00:46:04,535 --> 00:46:07,130
Speaker 1: Look at the action scenes, made no sense.

882
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:12,090
Speaker 1: There is no way a thrown piece of paper from a speeding cab lands in the other cab.

883
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:12,771
Speaker 0: Right.

884
00:46:13,715 --> 00:46:17,630
Speaker 0: Well, maybe they were like horse cabs, but no, they specifically had gas-powered cars.

885
00:46:18,011 --> 00:46:19,709
Speaker 1: Well, later, they both at different times.

886
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,085
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.

887
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:28,010
Speaker 1: But in 1Q84, the way the leader is described as moving, the way he shakes out his shoulders, there is an identical scene in this book.

888
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:31,910
Speaker 1: Where Sunday shakes out his shoulders and quivers like in this mask.

889
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:38,290
Speaker 0: I actually, for a time, because you know, every single one, almost half those guys were like guys in disguise in costume and shit like that, right?

890
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,290
Speaker 1: You thought he was in disguise too?

891
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,870
Speaker 0: I was pretty sure Sunday was like Gregory in an inflatable suit or something.

892
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:43,186
Speaker 0: Yeah.

893
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:44,909
Speaker 0: You know, for a few pages there.

894
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:49,390
Speaker 1: That would have been great, but I like the fact that Gregory was the only actual anarchist.

895
00:46:49,856 --> 00:46:50,067
Speaker 0: Yeah.

896
00:46:50,732 --> 00:46:51,309
Speaker 1: In the whole book.

897
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,570
Speaker 0: Nobody, no one was anarchist.

898
00:46:54,794 --> 00:46:55,890
Speaker 1: So what was the book trying to say?

899
00:46:56,572 --> 00:46:58,030
Speaker 0: What was the book trying to say?

900
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:04,950
Speaker 1: It made, much like other books we've read like this, it made many small points along the way, but doesn't have an overarching point.

901
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:21,010
Speaker 0: Well, I think, you know, the one point, I think there are many points to take away, but the biggest one I took away was the thing they say, you know, of course, whatever you say near the end of the book, right, is most likely to be, you know, something that is really very important, or towards the beginning also.

902
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:28,109
Speaker 0: So the one thing that I really took away was this one part here where it says, uh, pretty sure this is it.

903
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,636
Speaker 0: Yes.

904
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,190
Speaker 0: So I'm spraying to his feet, shaking from head to foot.

905
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,269
Speaker 0: I see everything, everything that there is.

906
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,950
Speaker 0: Why does each thing on earth war against each other thing?

907
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:40,570
Speaker 0: Why does each small thing in the world have to fight against the world itself?

908
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,150
Speaker 0: Why does a fly have to fight for the whole universe?

909
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,990
Speaker 0: You know, why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe?

910
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,410
Speaker 1: That could be a metaphor for the ridiculously of the anarchist position.

911
00:47:49,430 --> 00:48:08,990
Speaker 0: Yes, but, you know, for the same reason that I had to be alone in the dreadful council of the days, alone on the councils, he councils a group, but he was alone, so that each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of the anarchist, glory and isolation of the anarchist, so that each man fighting for order may be as brave and good as a man, a man as the dynamiter.

912
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:09,810
Speaker 0: There is something to be said.

913
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:17,290
Speaker 0: So that the real lie of Satan may be flung back in the face of the blasphemer, so that by tears and torture, we may earn the right to say to this man, you lie.

914
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:23,030
Speaker 0: No agonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser, we also have suffered.

915
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:31,310
Speaker 1: That buys into this idea that the anarchist feels put upon and feels alone and has only one noble way to fight back.

916
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:33,990
Speaker 1: But if they actually talk to each other.

917
00:48:34,851 --> 00:48:39,750
Speaker 0: Well, I think a whole lot of this is more about, you know, that's why I emphasized isolation, right?

918
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:49,670
Speaker 0: As you look at this book and it's about, you know, the difference, it shows you, you know, the hypocrisy of your anarchist, but you have a council or, you know, he's a cop.

919
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,147
Speaker 0: He goes, he sneaks into this thing alone, right?

920
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,830
Speaker 0: He thinks he's the only one who's undercover amongst the sea of anarchists.

921
00:48:55,971 --> 00:49:00,510
Speaker 0: He feels as the anarchist feels put upon by, you know, the whole world.

922
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:02,690
Speaker 0: It's him against this whole council of anarchists.

923
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:07,270
Speaker 0: But then, you know, because he's not an anarchist, you know, he teams up.

924
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:07,530
Speaker 0: Right.

925
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,819
Speaker 0: And that is the difference between the anarchist and the not anarchist.

926
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:17,650
Speaker 0: is that, you know, in a in a place with no rules, you know, and there's no governance and no law.

927
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:24,310
Speaker 0: There can be no teaming up because you all you can't fully trust anyone with no sort of structure or anything.

928
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,810
Speaker 0: But, you know, the good guys, the non anarchist.

929
00:49:27,052 --> 00:49:27,313
Speaker 0: Right.

930
00:49:27,555 --> 00:49:29,589
Speaker 0: They have the power to team.

931
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,372
Speaker 0: Right.

932
00:49:30,653 --> 00:49:32,138
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, it doesn't.

933
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,550
Speaker 0: it makes sense for them to have a council, to have a group to all to join up.

934
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,698
Speaker 0: And as they, you know, it's the whole half the book, more than half the book.

935
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:43,290
Speaker 0: is him going along, teaming up with these guys, getting the band together.

936
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:44,072
Speaker 0: Right.

937
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:49,750
Speaker 0: And then all chasing together in this team to get, you know, why was he fighting against, you know, to isolate himself.

938
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:53,648
Speaker 1: And yet the very nature of his struggle drives him to team up.

939
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:58,290
Speaker 0: Well, but but at the same time, he's the anarchist fights alone.

940
00:49:58,672 --> 00:49:58,954
Speaker 0: Right.

941
00:49:58,974 --> 00:49:59,618
Speaker 1: So here's the thing.

942
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,470
Speaker 1: Look at all the other anarchists from Gregory.

943
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,215
Speaker 1: They form this little council and everything.

944
00:50:03,637 --> 00:50:07,129
Speaker 1: And they were doing the same thing, but legit, at least trying to.

945
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:14,010
Speaker 0: But but when they went to do their bombing, it was one guy would actually do the bombing, whereas police, they went.

946
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,670
Speaker 0: You know, when it was time to do their thing, they all grouped up together in the chase.

947
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:22,410
Speaker 0: It wasn't like one guy carrying the weight of everybody, the fatal flaw of anarchism.

948
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:28,999
Speaker 1: Whenever you see like punk kids today talking about it, which is very common to libertarians or anything, they always sort of go down this road of.

949
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,950
Speaker 1: we don't need these authorities to tell us what to do.

950
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,474
Speaker 1: We can figure it out ourselves.

951
00:50:34,016 --> 00:50:38,350
Speaker 1: We can band together ourselves to provide these services consensually.

952
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,360
Speaker 0: Which is which is all right.

953
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:47,470
Speaker 0: So it's it's this, you know, conflict between the cooperation and individualism.

954
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:56,929
Speaker 1: The true anarchist, the Gregory, who actually would go and put the bomb is the one person that debate who, once the government's gone, would actually prevent new government from coming up.

955
00:50:57,231 --> 00:50:57,432
Speaker 1: Yeah.

956
00:50:57,553 --> 00:51:00,430
Speaker 1: And would bomb any government, even an anarchist government.

957
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,054
Speaker 0: But even Gregory.

958
00:51:02,074 --> 00:51:02,756
Speaker 0: Right.

959
00:51:03,017 --> 00:51:12,850
Speaker 0: Even the Gregory, who would bomb and would prevent government from forming and doesn't want to cooperate, still wants to have friends to walk in the woods with and have witty debates with.

960
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:22,030
Speaker 0: No, but that is and he's still and he still has the honor of not, you know, of sticking to the word that he said.

961
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,078
Speaker 0: He is he is putting law upon himself.

962
00:51:24,098 --> 00:51:26,809
Speaker 1: Now, there are two ways to interpret that.

963
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:27,531
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

964
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:33,170
Speaker 1: The police were all notably either a religious or straight up atheist.

965
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,415
Speaker 1: None of them knew the Bible.

966
00:51:34,496 --> 00:51:37,070
Speaker 1: It was really outside of what they talk about, archangels and things.

967
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,295
Speaker 1: But they it was made they were.

968
00:51:38,335 --> 00:51:41,390
Speaker 0: they were educated, you know, in true to atheist form.

969
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,538
Speaker 0: They were very well educated in religion.

970
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:47,050
Speaker 1: But it was made very clear that they did not know the Bible.

971
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:47,391
Speaker 1: Yep.

972
00:51:47,893 --> 00:51:51,007
Speaker 1: Yet they had this code of honor anyway.

973
00:51:51,428 --> 00:51:51,710
Speaker 1: He was.

974
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,562
Speaker 1: Simon was not afraid of damnation keeping his word.

975
00:51:54,582 --> 00:51:56,010
Speaker 1: He kept his word because he keeps his word.

976
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:56,731
Speaker 0: Exactly.

977
00:51:56,812 --> 00:52:03,749
Speaker 1: Gregory may, you could argue, kept his word out of a fear of submission to this higher authority that he cannot strike at.

978
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:05,193
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

979
00:52:05,213 --> 00:52:11,370
Speaker 0: So that is you're saying he could believe in anarchy being OK because he also believed in God.

980
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:18,630
Speaker 0: And so you don't need government because God keeps everything in line or because it was keeping him in line because he was religious or he was also an atheist.

981
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:26,490
Speaker 1: But in his isolationism, believe that he looked like he still, for whatever reason, had to keep up this honor, had to be an honorable person.

982
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:35,690
Speaker 1: Yet in the very end, in that scene, in the very end of the book, I point out he tells he basically calls them all cops, effectively breaking his word by revealing that to other cops.

983
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:36,314
Speaker 0: Yep.

984
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,290
Speaker 1: Sime never broke his word.

985
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:38,810
Speaker 0: Nope.

986
00:52:39,772 --> 00:52:48,310
Speaker 0: There's also the whole thing where the end, you can't even tell how much of that is real and how much that might be Sime tripping on who knows what.

987
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:53,941
Speaker 0: It's like really quick sentences that are like things went black and then he doesn't remember.

988
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:58,410
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's like, well, it kind of gets to the point that look at Gregory.

989
00:52:59,231 --> 00:53:10,250
Speaker 1: If the end is to be believed, despite all of his feelings and being a true anarchist can engage in intelligent conversation and debate and in fact seems more fulfilled by that than by bombing.

990
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:19,510
Speaker 1: So perhaps the true answer is to have all different kinds of people debate all different kinds of things in an intellectual place rather than a physical place.

991
00:53:22,193 --> 00:53:24,929
Speaker 1: Or it was just a thriller book with a bunch of allegory written 100 years ago.

992
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also definitely what it was.

993
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:31,509
Speaker 1: I'm glad I read it, but I could understand why other people wouldn't enjoy it.

994
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:40,350
Speaker 1: But if I was ever an English teacher, I bet your butt that if you were in eighth grade, you'd be reading this and writing me a five paragraph paper on the symbolism within.

995
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,140
Speaker 0: I will say that, you know, the book had many good parts.

996
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:46,989
Speaker 0: It had many flaws.

997
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:52,370
Speaker 0: And if it was any longer, the flaws might have outweighed.

998
00:53:53,212 --> 00:53:56,750
Speaker 0: But it is the correct length for the contents that it is containing.

999
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:01,790
Speaker 0: It is a box and all the contents of the box are fitting inside of it perfectly with no empty space.

1000
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:03,799
Speaker 0: And also it is not overflowing.

1001
00:54:03,819 --> 00:54:05,810
Speaker 0: so you can close the box very neatly.

1002
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,891
Speaker 1: All right.

1003
00:54:07,213 --> 00:54:11,570
Speaker 1: And I guess to wrap up the box metaphor, let's put a bow on it and stop because I'm kind of hungry.

1004
00:54:12,153 --> 00:54:12,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's go.

1005
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,680
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
