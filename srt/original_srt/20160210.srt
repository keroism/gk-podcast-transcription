00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:25,913
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:35,880
Speaker 0: So, uh, if any of you listen to the Monday episode this week my knob came today and Polish his knob all night.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,639
Speaker 0: I'm gonna use that knob to crank out a whole bunch of editing on the utensil thing.

9
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:47,587
Speaker 1: That is part of you know patreon and all that gonna spend all night Calibrating the knob and I guess you get anything done.

10
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:51,040
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be knobbing a lot tonight after I get the show up.

11
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:52,705
Speaker 0: We'll see.

12
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:53,451
Speaker 0: maybe the knob sucks.

13
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:54,440
Speaker 0: Maybe the knobs a bad deal.

14
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,393
Speaker 1: Hey, you're gonna get a whole bunch of knobbing it.

15
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:57,360
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get any work done.

16
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:00,183
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll send the knob back if it isn't Optimal.

17
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:03,558
Speaker 0: but a bunch of people I trust told me that the knobs a good deal and then I had.

18
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:04,556
Speaker 0: it's good thing I bought the knob.

19
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,339
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

20
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,099
Speaker 0: anime manga comics episode of geek nights, I do have a news.

21
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:26,060
Speaker 1: so The New York Children's Film Festival is coming up and even though we're not children That is always a great opportunity To see some animated films which tend to be thought of as children's films, even when they're not.

22
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:37,287
Speaker 1: It is in fact one of the best ways yeah, and in the past we have used this opportunity to see such movies as I think we saw when Marnie was there.

23
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:43,313
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we saw we pretty much summer wars like Every single movie like this that comes out.

24
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:54,530
Speaker 1: We just immediately go watch, you know It's basically we tend to go see those anime movies that aren't that like the number one top tier anime movies Like the the big-time jubilee movies.

25
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:03,040
Speaker 1: they get put out everywhere and you know, right but also Aren't the lowball ones like, you know one piece 15 or whatever course.

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,319
Speaker 0: A lot of these are the ones that get a wider release later, but we get to see him pretty early.

27
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:12,960
Speaker 1: So for example, we saw you know We saw some rewards that didn't really get a wider release in the u.s.

28
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,398
Speaker 0: Which is a shame because that's one of those movies that like you can get mom to watch and be really into sure.

29
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:21,979
Speaker 1: and then we saw When Marnie was there and that got a little release.

30
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:36,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though that was a very like artistic big-boy movie in a lot of ways Yeah, but so now you know Mamoru Hosoda who seems to make anime movies right in that zone and who has also been getting increasingly furry as time goes on.

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,400
Speaker 1: Sure, his new movie is I think we've mentioned on the show before is Boy and the Beast.

32
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:43,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess they replaced the beauty with a boy.

33
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:47,616
Speaker 0: I think we haven't talked about it a lot on the show partly because we haven't stopped.

34
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:50,211
Speaker 0: we're gonna go see it right But it's getting can?

35
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:51,480
Speaker 1: it's getting a wider release.

36
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:59,391
Speaker 1: So on March 4th, if you live anywhere near like a major, you know place and not you know The middle of nowhere where there's nothing but a multiplex.

37
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should probably be able to see this movie.

38
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:04,371
Speaker 0: It's an anime movie that I will predict is going to be good.

39
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:14,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, even in like secondary cities, you know Like say I don't know some place like Omaha, Nebraska, you should be able to see this movie.

40
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:15,560
Speaker 1: I didn't actually look at the list.

41
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,386
Speaker 1: You might not be able to.

42
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:18,763
Speaker 1: I didn't actually look at the list of theaters is playing it I don't know.

43
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,760
Speaker 0: I give it a 50/50 shot if it's in Omaha.

44
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:23,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's better than this, you know, it's way better than like the.

45
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:25,059
Speaker 1: you know zero right?

46
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:30,073
Speaker 1: See a March 4th, you can see this movie and you know.

47
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:31,980
Speaker 1: also there's like, you know Oscar nominee.

Speaker 0: Yes G kids is always just hitting it out of the park.

53
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,603
Speaker 1: well they're pretty much just like.

54
00:03:56,623 --> 00:04:04,717
Speaker 1: huh, no one else wants these amazing animations from other countries that aren't America and We will just license all of them and put them in America.

55
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,760
Speaker 0: We win Yeah, but Emily and I were looking at like a lot of the other movies in the festival.

56
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,111
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna go see like three or four movies like.

57
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,465
Speaker 0: there's a lot of movies to go Yeah, but there's good stuff.

58
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:15,188
Speaker 0: Good shit.

59
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,935
Speaker 0: Good shit bunch of good shit.

60
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can go see it You know, it won't be hard to see.

61
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:25,400
Speaker 0: So I realized how you know We.

62
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:32,180
Speaker 0: we used to attend a lot of anime conventions and a lot and we did a lot of panels and shows and staff and whatever.

63
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:38,160
Speaker 0: But you can tell how far out of that loop we are that I this is our friends.

64
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:44,937
Speaker 0: They were like, oh let's hang out because this weekend we're gonna be at a con and I assume they're gonna be at some like dumpy con upstate somewhere.

65
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:54,110
Speaker 0: cuz you know There's a con every weekend somewhere in the eastern seaboard and I was like, oh what kind of you guys go to and they're like Katsu khan.

66
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,010
Speaker 0: and I was like, whoa Moderately big.

67
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:57,477
Speaker 1: yeah

68
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:11,550
Speaker 0: It was a con that we not only used to go to But once hosted a late show with live music and Steve Bennett as a guest and we learned a lot about the Civil War Reenacting God the hobby and about why he has that hat on a

69
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:17,548
Speaker 1: comedy went to with our friend katsu and didn't make one joke the whole time about how his name was the same name as the convention.

70
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,052
Speaker 0: cuz yeah a con.

71
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:33,600
Speaker 0: where we were on the staff and Technically is yes We were brought into the staff and all we did was there's a video game room that had like an arcade Like an arcade that's better than what Pax has today, but not like what magfest is now.

72
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:41,786
Speaker 0: But it's like the size of the pack is about the size of the Pax one but better game selection yep, and We just DJ that room like.

73
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:53,380
Speaker 0: that was our job to play music and DJ the room and just kind of be there Weird times back in those old days, but yeah, it's coming up and I learned something interesting about Katsu con.

74
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:56,007
Speaker 0: They moved to the Gaylord where magfest is.

75
00:05:56,388 --> 00:06:04,080
Speaker 0: apparently the Gaylord has a ridiculous and draconian like Anti-photography rule across the entire facility.

76
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:07,030
Speaker 1: There's crazy rules about the mag.

77
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,060
Speaker 1: magfest is like photo central.

78
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:17,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, so from what I can gather there was running discussions between Multiple conventions fan convention.

79
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:22,460
Speaker 1: the magfest photo policy is pretty much the same as every other conventions photo policy.

80
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:28,918
Speaker 1: But I think it says something like you know Like you have to license your photo and assert like Creative Commons or whatever like you can't be.

81
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:35,439
Speaker 0: you know I don't know if magfest did anything with the Convention Center, but the Convention Center's technical rules were apparently pretty bad.

82
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:50,449
Speaker 0: and from what I found out from Katsu khan that they have this official statement pointing out that the Katsu khan is a special photo policy from the Gaylord for Katsu khan that is Considerably more relaxed than their standard policy.

83
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:58,795
Speaker 0: So you're allowed so you are allowed to at Katsu khan Take photos in public areas Which apparently you weren't allowed to do.

84
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:07,020
Speaker 0: I mean I'm sure the whatever policy the hotel yes on its own can so long as you use handheld equipment only You may not set up lighting of any kind.

85
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:15,684
Speaker 0: Photographers near subjects must respect the hotel environment by not being disruptive, which I guess The problem was.

86
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:21,306
Speaker 0: people were like getting in fountains and things okay, and everyone's got to have a badge Which I guess makes sense.

87
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:26,306
Speaker 1: you can't be in the convention without a badge regardless of photography except Which is interesting because they're a lot.

88
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,457
Speaker 0: that space is weird because a lot of it is not part of a convention.

89
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:29,979
Speaker 0: that's in there.

90
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,393
Speaker 1: I mean if you're outside on the street, it's a public street.

91
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:40,167
Speaker 0: Yeah, but well like of the Shrek area I guess you can take your cosplay photos in there, but that's not part of the con as far as I can Yeah, but it's still in a hotel lobby.

92
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:41,713
Speaker 1: So it's still a privately owned area.

93
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,319
Speaker 1: Yeah kick you out, right?

94
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,200
Speaker 1: So like you don't have a right to be in a hotel lobby like a homeless bum Can't just go in the hotel lobby and fall asleep.

95
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:48,413
Speaker 1: Yep.

96
00:07:48,881 --> 00:08:05,680
Speaker 0: So I was digging around to try to figure out like all the deal and we'll just there's an interesting story back there That I stumbled upon because I was reminded that katsu khan existed However, the only anime con we perform at is still anime Boston because katsu khan as far as I can tell does not comp its panelists.

97
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:09,135
Speaker 1: so Yeah, we'd have to buy a badge.

98
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:13,392
Speaker 1: Yeah Not buying a badge to provide not buying a badge to any.

99
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,600
Speaker 1: I don't buy a badge to pack cuz I'm not buying one to God.

100
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:15,703
Speaker 1: Yeah.

101
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:28,680
Speaker 0: But anyway all that aside a little geek bite But I watched with Emily all of over the garden wall like all the way through And I seen not in or I haven't seen like it wasn't like I saw the first half.

102
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,200
Speaker 1: It's like I saw episode one and I like episode four and like the last episode.

103
00:08:32,682 --> 00:08:39,304
Speaker 0: so I we watched all of it and I've almost watched all of it again because it is Crazy good.

104
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:42,815
Speaker 0: So once Scott watches it all then we'll probably do a show on it.

105
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,400
Speaker 0: But just go sit just go watch it.

106
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:45,584
Speaker 0: It's on Netflix.

107
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:46,870
Speaker 0: It's like ten episodes long.

108
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,753
Speaker 1: I don't have Netflix.

109
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:49,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, or no, I think it was on Hulu.

110
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:53,114
Speaker 0: I'd never know what anything's on anymore cuz I just have them both.

111
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,280
Speaker 0: But yeah, I think it's Hulu.

112
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:55,949
Speaker 1: I only pay for what I want at a time.

113
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:57,135
Speaker 1: Why should I waste a bunch of money?

114
00:08:57,256 --> 00:09:00,183
Speaker 0: It's ten short episodes The best way.

115
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:05,520
Speaker 0: I can really describe it as cross adventure time with waiting for Godot.

116
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,985
Speaker 0: hmm and Just just watch your show.

117
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:11,109
Speaker 0: Like you're gonna wonder what the.

118
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,093
Speaker 0: just watch your show.

119
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:14,060
Speaker 0: It's really well put together.

120
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:15,934
Speaker 1: That's some song of the sea in there also.

121
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:19,700
Speaker 1: Yeah The other way around you could say song of the sea has some garden wall.

122
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:20,282
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

123
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:24,138
Speaker 0: It's waiting for Godot, but then Godot shows up that that's what's going on in this thing.

124
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:28,420
Speaker 0: Also the bird Beatrice might be my favorite character.

125
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,818
Speaker 1: Yeah I saw one bird episode where they're like a bird could take you back to your nest.

126
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,679
Speaker 1: the bird was like Oh and the bird went somewhere else.

127
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,863
Speaker 0: Yeah The bird bird is.

128
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:40,920
Speaker 0: bird is Scott and like if you're gonna cosplay a character because you're gonna act like them you're Beatrice.

129
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:43,034
Speaker 0: Beatrice is just like yeah, you guys are dumb.

130
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:43,659
Speaker 0: Let's go this way.

131
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:53,720
Speaker 0: Anyway things of the day.

132
00:09:54,321 --> 00:10:07,080
Speaker 0: so I remembered this one when I was a kid like little kid and I never was really a hundred percent sure what its deal was until I stumbled upon it randomly on YouTube.

133
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:10,885
Speaker 0: This is a made-for-tv movie Written by dr.

134
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:19,959
Speaker 0: Seuss released in 1980 before I was born And it's called Pontiful Pock, where are you?

135
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:31,963
Speaker 0: the story of this movie is that there's a sad kid who's kind of dumb whose parents died and left him a rundown house that he's too Dumb to maintain.

136
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:36,238
Speaker 0: so a local business owner gives him a job at a pickle factory.

137
00:10:36,318 --> 00:10:40,880
Speaker 0: out of charity He proceeds to fuck up the job by pushing on the pull him and pulling on the push him.

138
00:10:41,443 --> 00:10:47,499
Speaker 0: So they arrest him and then fairies give him a magic piano That'll take him to a faraway land where he can get a new start.

139
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:52,480
Speaker 0: He does this and then angers the locals so badly that their military attacks him.

140
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:55,733
Speaker 0: He goes to a series of other places and continues to fuck up.

141
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:00,771
Speaker 0: and the moral of the whole movie Go back home work in the pickle factory.

142
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:02,800
Speaker 0: That's the best you'll ever do in your life at the end.

143
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,827
Speaker 1: Well, if you're a ponniful puck, that's true.

144
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:08,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he he never makes it out of that pickle factory.

145
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:11,060
Speaker 0: I'm surprised they even hired him back at the pickle factory.

146
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:20,153
Speaker 0: I don't know what this movie's trying to say because as far as I can tell it says Be grateful for your miserable lot in life and don't try to better yourself.

147
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:21,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why my number one.

148
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:25,652
Speaker 1: Dr Seuss is the Lorax the real one not states for the trees.

149
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,720
Speaker 1: Not that CG bullshit, right?

150
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,261
Speaker 1: You know?

151
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:36,040
Speaker 1: and then if you really want to get fancy, right if you really want to fuck your brain up a little You know, you want to double your ponniful pock power?

152
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,376
Speaker 1: Go and watch the five thousand fingers of dr.

153
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:39,416
Speaker 1: T.

154
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,397
Speaker 0: You're talking about that the other day, right?

155
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:49,418
Speaker 1: See if you can see if you can find it and then watch it and tell me what you think about some real dr.

156
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:49,699
Speaker 1: Seuss.

157
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:52,247
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

158
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:53,780
Speaker 1: Oh thing of the day, alright.

159
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,539
Speaker 1: so there's a guy that you know, but you don't know if you're a nerd and that man is named Bo Shek.

160
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:05,780
Speaker 1: and Before today, I didn't know who I mean, I knew who Bo Shek was that is didn't know his name was Bo Shek.

161
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:13,704
Speaker 0: it is telling that I read an article about Scott's thing and then Scott asked me if I knew who Bo Shek was and I was Didn't actually read the article.

162
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:16,071
Speaker 0: That's why I read an article by.

163
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:18,920
Speaker 1: so this is guy named Bo Shek.

164
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:33,240
Speaker 1: He is in Star Wars episode 4 for like less than a second when obi-wan goes into the cantina And he's got these like bounty hunters like well not bounty hunters like smugglers lined up and he's talking to them and he's like Hey, who should I you know?

165
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:43,420
Speaker 1: you want to take us for a ride is a and there's a guy standing in front of Chewbacca and The guy's like nah, but you can you know, he points and he's like, hey you should talk to the Wookie, right?

166
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,768
Speaker 1: That guy is Bo Shek.

167
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:47,375
Speaker 1: Well, at least that's the character's name.

168
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:48,620
Speaker 1: How do we know that's the character's name?

169
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,498
Speaker 1: Because if you buy the toy, there's an action figure for Bo Shek and it says Bo Shek on it.

170
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:56,464
Speaker 1: How you know?

171
00:12:56,685 --> 00:13:00,300
Speaker 0: wait wait, so let me get this straight because this is this is why this is an amazing thing.

172
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:08,035
Speaker 0: There was a character in one of the most well-known movies in human history Who had a speaking line.

173
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:08,739
Speaker 1: you didn't say anything.

174
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:09,585
Speaker 0: Oh, he didn't know that.

175
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:11,539
Speaker 0: I asked him but he didn't just points, right?

176
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,183
Speaker 0: But he got.

177
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:13,210
Speaker 0: so he talks.

178
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,479
Speaker 1: if you don't hear him time, you know what he had.

179
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:18,660
Speaker 1: He had some direction other than face was on these faces on the screen.

180
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,680
Speaker 0: He was addressed by a major character in a pivotal scene and he had an action figure.

181
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,619
Speaker 0: Yep, and yet no one knew who he was.

182
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:32,960
Speaker 1: Well, I mean Star Wars nerds knew that that character is named Bo Shek and they probably know more like alternate universe stuff about him.

183
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,239
Speaker 1: That's no longer canon, but nobody knew at least nobody knew who the actor was.

184
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,689
Speaker 1: They didn't know who that person was like.

185
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:43,420
Speaker 1: there's his face on the screen clear as day.

186
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,980
Speaker 1: But like you search and no one knew who it was.

187
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,144
Speaker 1: They wasn't in the credits.

188
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:52,617
Speaker 1: so and it's like they even called up like Lucasfilm and you know, whatever No one knew who this guy was.

189
00:13:52,637 --> 00:14:00,798
Speaker 0: now Imagine that you work at a job and someone calls you and they're like, hey Who the hell is that person in this photo of your company the person's in a movie in the 70s, right?

190
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:17,114
Speaker 1: You know, they could look up other movies around that time find a similar-looking actor and they there were some you know possibilities people saw You know play that got clips of like this one TV show in the UK where there was like a Russian thug who looked pretty similar To the guy and like I was that him?

191
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:17,900
Speaker 1: maybe I don't know.

192
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:20,910
Speaker 1: So this guy was investigating is like it's my mission.

193
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:22,616
Speaker 1: I'm gonna find Bo Shek.

194
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:25,951
Speaker 1: That's how I'm gonna do Right, so he goes out and he's looking.

195
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:26,353
Speaker 1: he's looking.

196
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:27,659
Speaker 1: he can't really find starting to give up.

197
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,280
Speaker 1: There's a whole article written by the guy Billy Jensen.

198
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:42,100
Speaker 1: Well, it's Billy Jensen calm and eventually one day he gets a. he gets contacted by someone Barry Gregory and Barry Gregory Was the grandson of Bo Shek Oh snap.

199
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,967
Speaker 1: and then he immediately emails Barry back and he got ever.

200
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:51,289
Speaker 1: he got the email address of Barry's mom who I guess was Bo Shek's daughter Sylvia Holt.

201
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:54,498
Speaker 1: and Sylvia Holt said my dad mr.

202
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:58,874
Speaker 1: Francis Alfred Basil Tomlin played the part of Bo Shek.

203
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:00,279
Speaker 1: everyone knew my dad is Tom.

204
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,679
Speaker 1: Fortunately, my dad passed away over 11 years ago.

205
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:12,439
Speaker 1: It'd be nice if we could get his name Recognized as his claim to fame was as part as Bo Shek and a stormtrooper in the first Star Wars film.

206
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,499
Speaker 0: now My question to the archive the archivist now is which stormtrooper?

207
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,277
Speaker 1: You have no way to know that but as proof she sent him a photo and there is no question.

208
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,163
Speaker 1: unless Bo Shek Mr.

209
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:26,610
Speaker 1: Tomlin had an identical twin.

210
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:32,170
Speaker 0: Wait, it might be taller Bo Shek Unless you know, you know the taller Luke thing, right?

211
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:32,571
Speaker 0: Yeah.

212
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:37,970
Speaker 1: Okay, unless he had an identical twin There is no doubt that this is the right person.

213
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,080
Speaker 1: and how could you pot the odds of being able to get a photograph of?

214
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,829
Speaker 1: this person Without being related to them are so small.

215
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:55,745
Speaker 0: So now we know who Bo Shek was so, you know every year There's like the news events that spawn Halloween costumes and cosplay like someone's gonna dress up in a tarp and that Crap like next year.

216
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:56,829
Speaker 0: Like what are the hot costumes?

217
00:15:57,451 --> 00:15:59,800
Speaker 0: The pro move is to dress up as Bo Shek.

218
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,390
Speaker 0: You're gonna see a lot of big checks.

219
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:03,080
Speaker 1: That's already been the pro move.

220
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,984
Speaker 1: You're not gonna see any Bo Shek see unless you go to Star Wars celebration Which I don't know they still have.

221
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:08,670
Speaker 0: I'll bet you five dollars.

222
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,638
Speaker 0: We see a Bo Shek at Kinetic on.

223
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,488
Speaker 0: no You want to shake on it?

224
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:13,313
Speaker 1: We won't see one.

225
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:15,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, boo you bet five bucks Are you gonna do?

226
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,933
Speaker 1: well, you might convince someone to do one, right?

227
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:18,355
Speaker 1: You can't.

228
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:19,479
Speaker 1: how can I know you didn't?

229
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,526
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

230
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:22,863
Speaker 0: I might convince someone simply The bet.

231
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:23,706
Speaker 1: let's bet.

232
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:26,696
Speaker 1: uh, you know, I told you so yeah, that's all right.

233
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:27,398
Speaker 0: I will bet.

234
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:31,457
Speaker 0: I told you so Okay, that way there's no incentive for me to pay someone to dress up as Bo Shek.

235
00:16:31,517 --> 00:16:32,039
Speaker 1: That's right.

236
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:38,660
Speaker 0: You know what actually the pro move would be to dress up as the guy in the photo that proved he was Bo Shek.

237
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,997
Speaker 1: Can't just find a guy who looks kind of like Bo Shek either and be like, oh he's dressing his.

238
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,347
Speaker 0: yeah Cuz the problem is I can imagine a lot of people who kind of look like that Just wear some like vaguely 70s clothes.

239
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:51,926
Speaker 1: And yeah, he's got to look like the action figure with the same You know flight suit and shit.

240
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:55,300
Speaker 0: and you if you if you ask him he has to be like I'm dressed up as Bo Shek.

241
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:56,404
Speaker 0: That's right You know.

242
00:16:56,505 --> 00:17:00,933
Speaker 0: if they're dressed up as the guy That counts too as long as they know.

243
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,099
Speaker 1: if you ask them who are you?

244
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,143
Speaker 1: What is your costume?

245
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:07,260
Speaker 1: and they say I'm Francis Alfred Basil Tomlin, then that will count as well.

246
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,809
Speaker 0: Yeah that if that happens then you can.

247
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,267
Speaker 0: then you can say I told you so that happens and it's not one of you listening Right now whoever it is.

248
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:15,453
Speaker 0: I'm gonna interview for the show.

249
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:17,432
Speaker 0: Just be like, all right, dude Right.

250
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:22,153
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, we're gonna be at magfest next weekend.

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,170
Speaker 0: What did we do in Boston between PAX and anime Boston?

257
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,636
Speaker 0: The answer was we drove to New Hampshire.

258
00:17:43,656 --> 00:17:43,937
Speaker 0: That's right.

259
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:44,620

Speaker 0: They're gonna do a similar thing.

261
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,960

269
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:10,020
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna get it done real quick now.

270
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,998
Speaker 0: Otherwise Show.

271
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,640
Speaker 0: So recently like I'd say the last six or seven years.

272
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:26,546
Speaker 0: It's very rare that I'll watch more than like one episode of an anime and not finish it Like I'll.

273
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:28,900
Speaker 0: just I'll watch a show and like having the first episode.

274
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,739
Speaker 0: I'm like nope and I never watch it again or I watch the whole show all the way through because it's that good.

275
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:47,084
Speaker 0: but there was a time in the distant past where Scott and I would both watch like Tens of episodes of shows and then just stop for some reason and One.

276
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:52,320
Speaker 0: we realized that we've done a show on Anime, we've never seen that are really important or big.

277
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,277
Speaker 0: I guess we did a show on shows that we've seen but never reviewed.

278
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:56,960
Speaker 0: for some reason.

279
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:59,850
Speaker 0: We did a episode on shows only Scott seen.

280
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:01,435
Speaker 0: on shows only rim seen.

281
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:02,920
Speaker 0: we never did an episode.

282
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,679
Speaker 0: Oh, and we've done episodes and shows that were bad based on one.

283
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:13,679
Speaker 0: Never done a show on shows that we watched a significant amount of and then for whatever reason didn't finish them.

284
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,215
Speaker 0: Okay, it's kind of like, you know, very few like.

285
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:20,989
Speaker 0: for a long time in my life I had a sort of personal rule.

286
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:30,373
Speaker 0: I would if I started reading a book That what there was a fiction book no matter what if I got past the first chapter I would always read it to the end no matter what.

287
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:35,700
Speaker 0: and There was a book that ended that for me and that book was dragons gold serpent silver.

288
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:38,580
Speaker 0: Come here as copper by Pierce Anthony and some other chucklefuck.

289
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:43,239
Speaker 0: That might have been the worst book I ever read and I got about halfway through that monster before I quit.

290
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,587
Speaker 0: Okay, like it was just like I was.

291
00:19:46,908 --> 00:19:50,720
Speaker 0: it was bad and I just hated it and I hated it more and more and more.

292
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:52,507
Speaker 0: And then this voice appeared in my head.

293
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:53,069
Speaker 0: It said rim.

294
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:54,535
Speaker 0: Just put it down.

295
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:59,278
Speaker 0: Just throw it away Never open it again that you don't have to finish it.

296
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:04,520
Speaker 0: And Yeah, so that was the best we could come up with because I watched a bunch of shows.

297
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,729
Speaker 0: Scott hasn't watched and Scott read a bunch of comics.

298
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:07,311
Speaker 0: I haven't read.

299
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,419
Speaker 0: so we're in that situation here again.

300
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:13,174
Speaker 1: Maybe you should you know watch the same thing.

301
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:14,260
Speaker 1: I watch or read the same thing.

302
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,666
Speaker 0: I read what name and we have.

303
00:20:15,686 --> 00:20:17,213
Speaker 0: you're not watching any cartoons though.

304
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:19,982
Speaker 1: I just watched all of evangelical We've.

305
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:20,243
Speaker 0: we've.

306
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:28,040
Speaker 0: not only we already done multiple shows about evangelical But we did a show about anime that we've watched that we watched again.

307
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we so you want to do.

308
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:36,546
Speaker 1: but after watching Evangelion again, I understand all of it now I'm like a hundred percent clarity.

309
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:37,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, it isn't interesting.

310
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,696
Speaker 1: I only had like 90% clarity before.

311
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:43,745
Speaker 0: I know there's only a few shows I'm like that with like utenna Evangelion eska flown in like.

312
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:45,512
Speaker 0: those are the shows like I've just seen.

313
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:47,017
Speaker 0: so there's an episode.

314
00:20:47,057 --> 00:20:53,729
Speaker 0: Scott shows We've rewatched more than once Like the shows that get the annual watch the biennial.

315
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:59,910
Speaker 1: I haven't watched this in like since I was living in Beacon When I think about it those kinds of shows like.

316
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:02,220
Speaker 0: it's like a four year ish cycle.

317
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:04,309
Speaker 1: This was like seven eight years for me.

318
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:12,420
Speaker 0: It's all four because I watched Ava again About five years ago because I had that platinum whatever edition and I just watched it like on my laptop.

319
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:14,380
Speaker 0: Well, I was traveling just like all right Ava.

320
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:15,652
Speaker 0: hmm.

321
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:29,252
Speaker 0: So, uh, I think the show that really typifies this and it's gonna start it all off is attack on Titan because I have technically Seen all of it so far But we know there's more coming and I mean you've seen all.

322
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,780
Speaker 1: I mean if you've seen it there's like a season.

323
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:35,520
Speaker 1: I mean, it wasn't even a season right that it wasn't a tag on Titan season one.

324
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,380
Speaker 1: It was a tag on Titan and you saw every episode.

325
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:38,324
Speaker 1: So you've seen it all.

326
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:41,980
Speaker 1: but well so anime wise if you don't count the manga or anything true.

327
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:46,900
Speaker 1: But we do know there is an OAV that comes with one of the manga volumes that I have.

328
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:51,200
Speaker 1: That's about the diary or whatever of so-and-so, but it is one of those shows.

329
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:57,260
Speaker 0: It's not like I don't know a shonen fighting whatever show that's gonna have like 700 episodes that goes on forever.

330
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,023
Speaker 0: At least I hope not.

331
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:03,859
Speaker 0: Nope, but it's a show that has a story and at the end of what's come out so far That story was not done.

332
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,665
Speaker 0: No Like not even close.

333
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:09,920
Speaker 1: like the manga goes on and I'm sure the anime will pick up again at some point.

334
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:12,754
Speaker 0: So I just kind of assumed I was gonna watch it when it came out.

335
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:17,151
Speaker 0: like whenever there's new attack on Titan I just watch it, but then I didn't even read the manga.

336
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,460
Speaker 0: I just read every spoiler I could find.

337
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:20,424
Speaker 1: I'm reading all.

338
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:24,099
Speaker 1: I got mangas and I've read a bunch of them and I think I'm gonna stop reading them.

339
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want a whole bunch of attack on Titan.

340
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:35,020
Speaker 0: volumes hit me up and once I read the spoilers I realized that the only thing the action scenes I liked and I like the characters.

341
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:37,718
Speaker 0: But then that kind of got played out there wasn't much new.

342
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:42,456
Speaker 0: All I actually cared about for the second half of the show was what's going on.

343
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:43,460
Speaker 0: I wanted to know the mystery.

344
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:46,030
Speaker 1: Well in the manga it gets to a point where it's not real.

345
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:55,740
Speaker 1: you don't get that sort of you know characters stuff anymore you don't get like a potato girl and whatever anymore and They start telling you more about the terrible secret of space, which is the best part.

346
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,290
Speaker 1: The problem is it's not a terrible secret of space and is neither terrible.

347
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:00,975
Speaker 1: No, it's it's a disappointment.

348
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:04,808
Speaker 0: It's not it's not terrible It's just terrible right exactly.

349
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:10,940
Speaker 1: Usually the terrible secret of space is something amazing Like yeah, or it's something that just fucks with your brain.

350
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:16,180
Speaker 0: But this is just like well, that's so lame like there's Titans in the walls, right?

351
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,240
Speaker 0: And now I know like what they are and why it's just super dumb and the coordinate.

352
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,940
Speaker 1: It's like you could have come up with a cool reason for why things are the way they are.

353
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:29,680
Speaker 1: But even even the expected reason that like, you know everyone like the most common theory that people would have at that point.

354
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:31,979
Speaker 1: But no, it was something dumb.

355
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:38,647
Speaker 0: Yeah I think the things that really made me not give a shit was like the secret of his dad is dumb The the king.

356
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,511
Speaker 0: that stuff goes.

357
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:41,280
Speaker 1: no king is the number one thing, right?

358
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,564
Speaker 1: So the king it's like this.

359
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:53,560
Speaker 1: they talk about royalty and like the royal family and you know that in the middle of the town And in the most secret place where the terrible secret of space is kept always in the middle You know the center the big tower or whatever, right?

360
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,820
Speaker 1: I mean this doesn't actually have a big tower in attack on Titan.

361
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,700
Speaker 1: But yeah, you know the the metaphorical big tower that all animes have where all the secrets are, right?

362
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:09,228
Speaker 1: you know an evangelical is actually a big hole in the ground or the bottom of the secrets are and It's like the king.

363
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:10,253
Speaker 1: we've never seen the king.

364
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:11,660
Speaker 1: we don't know anything about the king.

365
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:16,689
Speaker 1: It must be this mysterious awesome, dude Who's got like super evil and he's knows everything.

366
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:22,547
Speaker 1: and he's you know, he's got his machinations right and a full metal Alchemist this King Bradley.

367
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:28,900
Speaker 1: and while he's not, you know, he's not like the perfect ultimate badass king It's like it's still like whoa, that's his deal.

368
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:29,983
Speaker 0: He's got.

369
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:34,898
Speaker 0: wait like when you run it gets revealed you're like, oh, it's like oh shit son King Bradley.

370
00:24:34,938 --> 00:24:35,600
Speaker 1: Oh snap, right?

371
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:41,076
Speaker 1: The king in full metal the king in attack on Titan is like the biggest disappointment.

372
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:45,100
Speaker 1: It's like really really That's what the king is really pointing in two ways.

373
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,159
Speaker 0: Cuz one you all the theories you might have are so wrong and it's so dumb.

374
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:51,183
Speaker 1: It's dumb.

375
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:54,793
Speaker 0: it being revealed sends the show in yet another direction.

376
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:56,358
Speaker 0: That is also dumb.

377
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:58,627
Speaker 1: Yep So disappointing.

378
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:00,797
Speaker 1: it's like oh, that's what the fuck.

379
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:01,460
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit.

380
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:11,509
Speaker 1: Yep, if they do they could have just done the cliche thing and made the king a badass of evil and I would have been like oh How did he become a badass of evil?

381
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:12,392
Speaker 1: Well, it's like.

382
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:14,037
Speaker 1: where's how you know, what's he knows?

383
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:16,156
Speaker 1: Nope, they didn't do any of that.

384
00:25:16,842 --> 00:25:17,223
Speaker 0: So is it?

385
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:20,880
Speaker 0: because remember way back cuz there was noir and hack side and we watched all of noir.

386
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,631
Speaker 1: Well, those shows weren't really that related except for the music.

387
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, but a time in which they came out exactly.

388
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,067
Speaker 0: but that's how anime like.

389
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:33,916
Speaker 0: that's how they're stuck together in my head because One of them tricked me and then I realized what was going on with the other one cuz noir.

390
00:25:34,477 --> 00:25:40,573
Speaker 0: not good Like real bad after the first four episodes and super bad, but it's not good.

391
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:50,479
Speaker 0: Like it's just the anime rim of 2016 would have watched the first five minutes of the fifth episode of noir and said nope and just turn it off.

392
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:59,199
Speaker 0: probably on yeah, but Hexine was the I think the first anime where I consciously wanted to watch it.

393
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,100
Speaker 0: Everyone else I knew was into it.

394
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:07,486
Speaker 0: I was like, oh this is the big show and I was really into it and I was trying to be into it and then Episode 13 came around.

395
00:26:07,506 --> 00:26:08,110
Speaker 0: I was like, you know what?

396
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:09,620
Speaker 0: I just don't care.

397
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:11,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was what you know.

398
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,143
Speaker 1: There's a lot of.

399
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:22,260
Speaker 1: most of the anime is actually that I started and did not finish even like, you know They're full run of was for this reason which is it just dragged and nothing happened, right?

400
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:28,579
Speaker 1: So hack sign is the biggest drag of them all where it's like key of the Twilight Key of the Twilight.

401
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:29,726
Speaker 1: Where is the key of the toilet?

402
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:30,892
Speaker 1: What's the key of the Twilight?

403
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:31,475
Speaker 1: Where is it?

404
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:31,978
Speaker 1: What is it?

405
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:32,340
Speaker 1: Who's good?

406
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:32,862
Speaker 1: What's going on?

407
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:33,727
Speaker 1: And then just are like.

408
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:39,437
Speaker 1: I realized at a point like after 13 episodes They made like one step of progress towards the key of the Twilight.

409
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:42,588
Speaker 1: I was like For like seven episodes nothing happened.

410
00:26:42,628 --> 00:26:42,848
Speaker 1: Did it?

411
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,096
Speaker 1: No nothing happened for like the last seven episodes.

412
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:48,920
Speaker 1: Well, I'm done watching Yep, the same thing happened in Naruto, right?

413
00:26:49,120 --> 00:27:06,919
Speaker 1: So Naruto is a situation where it's like they fought they fire fighting this big guy with a big sword who had like a partner who stood off to the side and After 13 episodes they beat the guy with the big sword and then like my brain woke up and was like They've been fighting the big guy with the big sword for like seven episodes.

414
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:14,429
Speaker 0: now I had quit before they even beat that guy because there was a moment where like Naruto did a move And I was in the fight with that.

415
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:25,514
Speaker 0: Yes, so Luke and Everyone in the anime club who was watching it faster than I was and they were like, oh my god When you find out how Naruto does the thing like it's crazy.

416
00:27:25,615 --> 00:27:29,089
Speaker 0: and then I saw it and I was like They just made up a bunch of proper nouns.

417
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:29,772
Speaker 0: That's all they did.

418
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:30,133
Speaker 0: Nothing.

419
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:34,349
Speaker 0: They didn't even animate it And I stopped watching but you kept going.

420
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,820
Speaker 1: I went for 13 episodes ish, right?

421
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,828
Speaker 1: There was another show.

422
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:40,760
Speaker 1: what the hell was the name of that at least with the Shonen?

423
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:44,132
Speaker 1: There was a Shonen one with the little pet that had a pointy nose.

424
00:27:44,754 --> 00:27:48,634
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the rave master That's the one you watch that show.

425
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:49,680
Speaker 0: I didn't watch any of it.

426
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:50,506
Speaker 1: I watched.

427
00:27:50,929 --> 00:28:00,386
Speaker 1: I watched rave master because It had this cute animal friend with a pointy nose and after some number of episodes I forget how many I realized.

428
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:00,968
Speaker 1: wait a minute.

429
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:07,637
Speaker 1: This show has been in this one throne room ish room Fighting for like at least five episodes now.

430
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:12,134
Speaker 0: I'm done Yep, but I never even started that one because it was another show.

431
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:20,933
Speaker 0: only watch it because there's a cute monster Yeah, but also like people's also kids show mostly we're all talking about it Like I saw the spiral nose guy everywhere at conventions.

432
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,446
Speaker 0: I was like, well you still see him occasionally Yeah, who who?

433
00:28:24,546 --> 00:28:26,815
Speaker 0: yeah, but who is the person who is still into that show?

434
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:27,356
Speaker 0: Nobody?

435
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:28,119
Speaker 1: No one who remembers it.

436
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:30,751
Speaker 0: All right other shows ever do you hockey show?

437
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:31,575
Speaker 0: We were really into that.

438
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:32,540
Speaker 1: I was about to bring up you.

439
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,487
Speaker 1: How do you show?

440
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:35,279
Speaker 0: I could remember the name of until a second ago?

441
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,806
Speaker 1: Oh, so you hockey shows.

442
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:40,760
Speaker 1: a similar situation where actually I think you hockey shows better than all the shows You just mentioned by a lot.

443
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:48,202
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah But it's like it actually is the best example of the show that starts drugs Naruto.

444
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:52,580
Speaker 1: the first few episodes are funny ninja school and then it drags right rave master.

445
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,379
Speaker 1: The first few episodes are like genero fantasy and then it drags, right?

446
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,360
Speaker 1: You know hack sign the beginning doesn't really do much and then it you know what episode one and then it drags.

447
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:04,609
Speaker 1: But you hug a show.

448
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:13,780
Speaker 1: the first two episodes Start so strong setting up the world and then it's like tournament time and it's like man.

449
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:26,082
Speaker 0: Come on I think you you have a show was the show where I went from Watching a bunch of episodes of a shonen show and then being disappointed to starting to see it coming ahead of time I was like, wait a minute It's like it.

450
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:38,030
Speaker 1: those if you just made instead of having a stupid fighting part if you just made all the episodes just like those First beginning episodes that set everything up, you know If you just progressed plot without fighting all the time, however,

451
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,414
Speaker 0: there is the problem having

452
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:41,420
Speaker 1: an explicit tournament of fighting.

453
00:29:42,442 --> 00:29:43,909
Speaker 0: So it's not that analogous.

454
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:53,605
Speaker 0: but Full Metal Panic had plot that was serious and interspersed with that plot was Ridiculous nonsense and comedy.

455
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:54,387
Speaker 1: Oh, that was what.

456
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:58,940
Speaker 1: that's a more typical pattern where yeah comedy starts in the early parts and then it fades.

457
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:07,460
Speaker 1: Slayers does the same thing that Full Metal Panic does where the comedy is strong in the early episodes and then it fades as the Plot takes over in the later episode.

458
00:30:07,561 --> 00:30:14,467
Speaker 1: Yeah, but so I watched about half the thing is with Full Metal Panic The comedy is okay And the plot is really weak.

459
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:18,099
Speaker 1: and then I actually watched the whole first season because I don't know.

460
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:25,792
Speaker 1: And then I watched like one Fu Mafu and I'm like, nope Inuyasha got me pretty bad because it was a.

461
00:30:25,812 --> 00:30:27,040
Speaker 0: you know, we're gonna go Takahashi.

462
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:28,850
Speaker 0: But it was actually really good.

463
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:37,733
Speaker 0: and there and I was like wow This is actually like the plot is moving as Keflon a style like shit keeps happening and there was literally a moment Where they have the MacGuffin.

464
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:42,619
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh wow Cuz you know though, you know when there's a show where like you expect the MacGuffin to be the whole show.

465
00:30:43,022 --> 00:30:45,380
Speaker 0: And then the MacGuffins like done in the fourth episode.

466
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:45,839
Speaker 1: Yep

467
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:55,612
Speaker 0: So that happened and then they dropped it and it exploded to a million shards and the one character is like now we have to go Collect all the shards and I literally hit pause and was like welp

468
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:57,640
Speaker 1: shouldn't they just be on the floor right in front of you?

469
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,794
Speaker 0: No, they flew off around the planet or something.

470
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:02,375
Speaker 0: use a vacuum [Laughter].

471
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:11,440
Speaker 0: So then there are the shows that we actually Liked and just stopped watching for some reason like Ergo Proxy Scott and I were watching in Beacon.

472
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:18,200
Speaker 0: Well, you're watching on Netflix physical DVDs Yeah, and I remember like we weren't super into it after the first couple episodes.

473
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:25,520
Speaker 0: But then like it got better and better as it started to deconstruct itself It was like oh, maybe this show isn't about what we thought it was.

474
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,525
Speaker 0: this looks interesting.

475
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:36,986
Speaker 0: and then as far as I can remember a DVD came that was scratched and wouldn't play and then eventually we got another DVD That was a different one.

476
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:40,659
Speaker 0: That was also scratched and wouldn't play and then we just kind of forgot about the show.

477
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:45,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it really it's all about friction right and like effort to watch another episode, right?

478
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:55,679
Speaker 1: So like if I have the whole show right there and I've got nothing to do I'll just be like next episode next episode next episode next until I've seen the whole thing right unless something stops me.

479
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,833
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Windows Ergo Proxy DVDs came.

480
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,780
Speaker 0: we watched all four episodes.

481
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,607
Speaker 1: So something stops me, right?

482
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,197
Speaker 1: So let's say I watch you know, six episodes of evangelical and then I got to go to bed.

483
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:06,860
Speaker 1: that stops me.

484
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,723
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

485
00:32:07,823 --> 00:32:10,273
Speaker 0: now sometimes it doesn't though with the shows good enough.

486
00:32:10,293 --> 00:32:15,820
Speaker 0: like that six episode ends It's two in the morning and you're like I gotta watch one more right and then you know.

487
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:24,160
Speaker 1: So the next day I get home from work is the show strong enough to make me after or while eating dinner Pick it up again, right?

488
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:24,481
Speaker 1: It's like.

489
00:32:24,662 --> 00:32:29,056
Speaker 1: does it have the strength to keep to occupy my brain space from the previous day?

490
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:33,180
Speaker 1: and in a case like Evangelion it sure does but not every show has that strength.

491
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,060
Speaker 1: There were a lot of shows where I could watch them a bunch and then I completely forgot about them.

492
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:42,534
Speaker 1: There are other shows say for example Like I was watching space run away e day.

493
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:47,820
Speaker 1: Oh Right, so I was watching it while biking inside, right?

494
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:57,369
Speaker 1: So I'd bike inside and watch a day on at the same time and then the Sun came out one day And I was biking outside and no longer biking inside.

495
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,516
Speaker 1: So the habit of watching e day.

496
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:02,668
Speaker 0: Oh every day Disappeared, you know what happened.

497
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:08,016
Speaker 1: the same thing old Sailor Moon when I didn't yeah I didn't have this sort of it wasn't able to pull me.

498
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,337
Speaker 1: like man.

499
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,012
Speaker 1: I really need to know what happens in the next episode.

500
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:12,300
Speaker 1: I really care about this show.

501
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:12,761
Speaker 1: It was just.

502
00:33:12,842 --> 00:33:17,619
Speaker 1: it was just this habit and if the habit was broken there wasn't anything pulling me.

503
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:19,467
Speaker 1: Yeah show didn't have any strength.

504
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:22,200
Speaker 1: now some watch another episode, you know.

505
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,780
Speaker 1: There are also times where that's happened with shows were like a weekend or a convention or you know.

506
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,080
Speaker 1: It's like I'll be watching it all week and I'll go away and come back and I'll forgot that I was watching.

507
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,350
Speaker 0: That was when we were rewatching old Sailor Moon cuz.

508
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,044
Speaker 0: they were releasing like two episodes a week and I was just keeping up I think.

509
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:42,152
Speaker 0: we went to a Scott Johnson party Yeah, and then came back and then forgot Yeah, because then it was a little bit behind and then I just let it get.

510
00:33:42,193 --> 00:33:43,720
Speaker 0: leave town come home.

511
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:48,080
Speaker 1: You know you missed the habit and they were releasing four episodes a week or two or something.

512
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,405
Speaker 1: It was more than one Right, and then it's like.

513
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:55,719
Speaker 1: well I didn't watch him last week edited and watching lists week and now there's like eight of them and I'm like, well, I'm way behind now

514
00:33:56,193 --> 00:34:04,619
Speaker 0: Yep But as opposed like ergo proxy had a lot a strong drive to the point that I we tried Two times to get the DVD to watch it before we gave up.

515
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:07,350
Speaker 1: So actually I feel I mean there were other shows.

516
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,580
Speaker 1: we got a Netflix DVD that we didn't finish.

517
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:14,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know what those best example of that is fucking cause they know you Jim.

518
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,871
Speaker 1: That's the one I was about to say.

519
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:18,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the show We did an episode on a long time ago.

520
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,350
Speaker 1: You can go listen to that episode cuz.

521
00:34:20,471 --> 00:34:25,040
Speaker 1: I don't remember it enough now But I definitely have a podcast of a time when I did remember it.

522
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,958
Speaker 0: But the show basically had a problem where it was pretty good.

523
00:34:28,481 --> 00:34:33,536
Speaker 0: But like after an episode ended there was a moment where I realized I didn't really give a shit.

524
00:34:33,556 --> 00:34:34,659
Speaker 0: if I never saw more of it.

525
00:34:34,882 --> 00:34:35,859
Speaker 1: I do not give any shits.

526
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,284
Speaker 0: It's not like cowboy bebop.

527
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:44,708
Speaker 1: or you show someone episode one you show and then half an episode and pause it and then they're like What I kill you Reaching to push the unpause.

528
00:34:44,728 --> 00:34:45,494
Speaker 0: it was it Pete.

529
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:48,284
Speaker 0: I think it would never seen Cowboy bebop Alex.

530
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:49,510
Speaker 1: maybe it was one of our friends.

531
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:56,440
Speaker 0: All right, Pete, maybe like we were at school We moved into our apartment early like school didn't start for like days and we're all hanging out.

532
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,849
Speaker 0: We're like, oh you've never seen cowboy bebop.

533
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:58,392
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

534
00:34:58,654 --> 00:34:59,560
Speaker 0: So we showed him one episode.

535
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,638
Speaker 0: We're like, this is what it's like.

536
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:05,959
Speaker 0: We'll show you an episode will lend you the DVDs and then the three of us just watch the entire show that day.

537
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,564
Speaker 0: Yeah all the way to the end.

538
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:12,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we broke for dinner and we ate dinner watching episodes like it was.

539
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:17,485
Speaker 0: So there are shows that are bad But they're not really.

540
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:19,715
Speaker 0: they don't fit on this list because usually the show is bad.

541
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:21,639
Speaker 0: We're just like well that's bad We don't watch it.

542
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:28,060
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm just plenty of things I've seen one episode of and then that's it Right, and it's like that doesn't really count as stopped watching.

543
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:34,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I wasn't watching it really to begin with I just was a glancing or inspecting or whatever, right?

544
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,708
Speaker 0: But like I remember love Hina was.

545
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:37,992
Speaker 1: I watched the whole thing.

546
00:35:38,193 --> 00:35:40,100
Speaker 0: I don't know how because it was real big.

547
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:41,870
Speaker 1: I will tell you how I watched the whole thing.

548
00:35:42,152 --> 00:35:44,746
Speaker 1: love Hina came out our Turtle.

549
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:45,630
Speaker 0: you want to get to the turtle?

550
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:47,800
Speaker 1: Well, yeah turtle there was a turtle episode, by the way.

551
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a point with the turtle like the horse in utana.

552
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,460
Speaker 0: Did I assume the turtle stole someone's bra though?

553
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,486
Speaker 0: No, really?

554
00:35:54,072 --> 00:35:54,516
Speaker 1: Maybe dip.

555
00:35:54,556 --> 00:35:54,960
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

556
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:03,600
Speaker 1: So love Hina freshman year of college We saw like one or two episodes at anime club and it was just cute and it had a turtle.

557
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,840
Speaker 1: So I downloaded the whole thing and this is towards the end of that freshman year.

558
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:10,980
Speaker 1: So I didn't watch the whole thing in college.

559
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:27,317
Speaker 1: But then it was summer and I did some camp counselor action in summer and then I was And then I was in Connecticut in my house in Connecticut with nothing to fucking do in the summer Except I guess sit outside in the summer and I had my computer and I had a 56k modem.

560
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:29,545
Speaker 0: So, you know what that?

561
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:35,645
Speaker 1: I had CD roms and on those CD roms was every episode of love Hina That's got is a different episode.

562
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:44,413
Speaker 0: that is an episode of geek knives shows we watched all of because we were trapped in the wilderness Because I did the same thing with read or die TV.

563
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:48,358
Speaker 0: that show is garbage Garbage, but I had it.

564
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:54,320
Speaker 0: I had a bunch of DVDs with with it burn like pirated and I was living in a place with no internet.

565
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:55,164
Speaker 0: I was bored.

566
00:36:55,545 --> 00:37:01,085
Speaker 0: I watched the entire show and it is Terrible.

567
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:03,660
Speaker 0: at no point does it redeem itself ever?

568
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,052
Speaker 1: Well, you know love Hina wasn't the worst thing to watch cuz.

569
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:10,551
Speaker 1: I had not at that point Watched a harem show and I guess you everybody gets one.

570
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:14,865
Speaker 1: you could find a lot worse harem shows and not saying love Hina's good Don't don't watch love Hina.

571
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:18,197
Speaker 0: No, no, you're gonna watch a harem show like full disclosure.

572
00:37:18,498 --> 00:37:19,080
Speaker 0: watch tenshi.

573
00:37:19,221 --> 00:37:29,820
Speaker 1: I don't want anyone to misinterpret and think I'm Cuz it was not good for you know for the one harem show that I've seen all the way through It's like that's you know, I could have done a lot worse.

574
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,567
Speaker 1: I could have done better but it's like it's fine.

575
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:33,997
Speaker 0: Tenchi Muyo is the best harem show.

576
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:41,847
Speaker 0: Mmm I'm gonna say it like that in that genre the best Harem of girls guy character show.

577
00:37:42,288 --> 00:37:44,957
Speaker 1: it is the best one has to be one guy and a whole bunch of girls.

578
00:37:45,078 --> 00:37:52,602
Speaker 0: Yeah I feel like there's other shows that me cuz tenchi had enough sci-fi and humor going on - it's not the worst show in the World.

579
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:54,940
Speaker 0: like I give it a solid B rating overall.

580
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:59,522
Speaker 1: There had to be other shows that are technically harem shows that but they're all There's.

581
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:00,874
Speaker 0: well, there's other tenchi.

582
00:38:00,894 --> 00:38:01,459
Speaker 0: that's real bad.

583
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,439
Speaker 0: But yeah, I guess they're.

584
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:14,783
Speaker 0: you know There's a factor where love Hina was a show where I quit watching it because I want I was creeped out by it Mostly when the young character came in and then they kind of kept like she was part of the harem That.

585
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:18,540
Speaker 0: that was when I started to notice that shit going on more and more in anime.

586
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:21,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that's it by watching the whole thing, right?

587
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,059
Speaker 1: That's I was learning about the evils of those ways and now and then after that I was well informed.

588
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:30,235
Speaker 1: back then We didn't know there was able to avoid danger in the future.

589
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:31,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, like we didn't know.

590
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,940
Speaker 1: I have not hit any danger since then.

591
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:35,744
Speaker 1: I'm protected.

592
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:41,204
Speaker 0: shows like love Hina the resistance the anime Around us.

593
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,629
Speaker 0: we're super into it.

594
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,540
Speaker 0: So, you know you get a new situation at the time.

595
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:55,494
Speaker 0: Yeah for like about a week But it's a situation where there's a show that all the people around you are watching and you watch a few episodes And you don't like it, but everyone else keeps watching it.

596
00:38:55,514 --> 00:38:56,980
Speaker 0: So you feel like well am I missing something?

597
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,991
Speaker 0: Am I dumb or no, they're dumb.

598
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:01,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're the but they're the wrong ones.

599
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:02,003
Speaker 0: Not you I know.

600
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:11,485
Speaker 1: are there any shows that were actually Because all the shows you mentioned so far were like, oh it was a show that we started watching for some reason But the show wasn't actually any good.

601
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:12,127
Speaker 1: So he stopped.

602
00:39:12,187 --> 00:39:13,732
Speaker 1: is there actually a good show?

603
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:14,494
Speaker 0: ergo proxy.

604
00:39:14,554 --> 00:39:16,440
Speaker 0: We stopped because of technical difficulties.

605
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:21,995
Speaker 0: So Rosaphone I hear is a really good show, but I got the whole thing.

606
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:23,358
Speaker 0: It's Okay.

607
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,866
Speaker 0: So I've heard reviews of it.

608
00:39:25,886 --> 00:39:29,498
Speaker 1: beginning is way better than the later part ranging from it's pretty good to it.

609
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,445
Speaker 0: Does Ava better than Ava?

610
00:39:31,465 --> 00:39:31,867
Speaker 1: I don't know.

611
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:33,494
Speaker 1: whoever said that is fucked up and I am.

612
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:43,611
Speaker 0: I'm not super Believing that that's a fucked up stupid person, but I just kind of stopped watching it because after four episodes I didn't feel like it was going where I cared about and I just stopped.

613
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,053
Speaker 0: but it wasn't.

614
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:45,700
Speaker 0: I don't think it was necessarily that bad.

615
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,660
Speaker 1: I think I just watched it all because of inertia.

616
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:53,844
Speaker 1: It's one of those shows where if I had been interrupted by say a trip out of town I might I probably wouldn't have continued watching Yeah.

617
00:39:54,380 --> 00:40:01,880
Speaker 1: But because I was in a situation where no blockers came in I just kept rolling like lazily on and saw the whole thing.

618
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,563
Speaker 0: Oh, here's one.

619
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:04,350
Speaker 0: So Fuji go mean a when it first came out.

620
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:05,796
Speaker 0: We watched a couple episodes.

621
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:09,679
Speaker 0: It was crazy good Yeah, and I watched every episode as it came out.

622
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,976
Speaker 0: But then I basically got distracted and kind of forgot it existed.

623
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,606
Speaker 1: like I was also distracted Yeah, and I didn't forget it existed.

624
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,740
Speaker 0: I was just doing other stuff, but I like forgot about it for a long time.

625
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:27,153
Speaker 0: It was only recently when all the new Lupin stuff started coming out that I was like, oh right Lupin I didn't finish that other Lupin and I haven't seen Lupin in a while.

626
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:28,560
Speaker 1: I need to refresh my Lupin.

627
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:32,171
Speaker 0: Oh, I think we're entering a golden age of Lupin.

628
00:40:32,372 --> 00:40:32,854
Speaker 0: It's Lupin.

629
00:40:32,894 --> 00:40:37,287
Speaker 1: It's definitely Lupin o'clock right about now That Bell is ringing so hard.

630
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:39,535
Speaker 0: Those clock hands are crushing so many counts.

631
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:41,060
Speaker 1: It is currently Lupin o'clock.

632
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:42,438
Speaker 1: Actually, maybe I'll watch it when I get home.

633
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,803
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you would?

634
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:48,938
Speaker 0: so when you get to the point where Lupin sees the owls - I that's like that's.

635
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:51,910
Speaker 0: that's when it Starts to get into the plot like the plot plot.

636
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:52,734
Speaker 1: It's.

637
00:40:52,794 --> 00:40:54,120
Speaker 1: I never seen a Lupin with the plot.

638
00:40:54,981 --> 00:40:56,187
Speaker 1: That wasn't just a movie that ended.

639
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:56,649
Speaker 0: Yeah.

640
00:40:56,931 --> 00:40:58,700
Speaker 0: I mean the show is just yeah.

641
00:41:00,642 --> 00:41:07,740
Speaker 0: It's like the spongebob of heist anime Shows that are really good that we never finished.

642
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:15,144
Speaker 1: Well, one of them for me is one that people like love the fuck out of which is Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, right?

643
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:21,146
Speaker 1: So I was watching the newer one the one that has the roundabout closer, which is like the one of the best Yeah, I ever seen right.

644
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:22,491
Speaker 0: I watched a bunch of episodes.

645
00:41:22,572 --> 00:41:23,174
Speaker 1: I was into it.

646
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:23,897
Speaker 1: I was into it.

647
00:41:23,937 --> 00:41:24,620
Speaker 1: I was enjoying it.

648
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,966
Speaker 1: I wanted to find out what happened.

649
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:28,800
Speaker 1: You know, I cared about do is so evil and badass.

650
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:31,120
Speaker 1: I wanted to see him get some fighting action, right?

651
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:38,129
Speaker 1: And I was also curious because I'd known a lot of stuff about Joe Joe's and I know that like they go to Egypt at Some point like I read a ton of the manga.

652
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:41,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanted I wanted to know about that shit, right?

653
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,656
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, I was I was into it and then it got to this point.

654
00:41:44,677 --> 00:41:52,406
Speaker 1: We're like, okay He's learning some you know, some like, you know fighting powers and then they meet this huge dude They have to fight and then

655
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,456
Speaker 0: I know you're describing every episode of Joe Joe's right

656
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:57,814
Speaker 1: and it was like, oh, I'm like, okay I'm you know I'm with this.

657
00:41:58,241 --> 00:42:07,737
Speaker 1: There's some fight in a castle or something and then I just didn't watch the next Episode when it came out and then I fell behind and then I forgot about it and then that was that.

658
00:42:07,978 --> 00:42:12,616
Speaker 0: the problem I have With Joe Joe's is that I love everything about it except actually watching it.

659
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,662
Speaker 1: I think that's what it is Like.

660
00:42:13,722 --> 00:42:14,570
Speaker 0: I love the aesthetic.

661
00:42:14,651 --> 00:42:15,600
Speaker 0: I love the characters.

662
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:28,837
Speaker 1: The story is so just fucking crazy that I love it But I actually watch it and then I just kind of when I actually watch it It's like I might enjoy myself while watching it, but there there's no pull for the next episode.

663
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:31,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It's like it doesn't make me want anymore.

664
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,170
Speaker 0: I'm not like really worried about what's gonna happen.

665
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:38,909
Speaker 0: because what's gonna happen is gonna be Joe Joe being like, haha I did X because of Y and Z right.

666
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:45,800
Speaker 1: for some reason fist of the North Star is Quite similar, but when you watch fist of the North Star is like I just want to watch another one.

667
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:46,623
Speaker 1: It's like I'm.

668
00:42:46,643 --> 00:42:49,857
Speaker 1: you know, when I watch it Joe Joe's like I'm seated like I'm like, oh, all right.

669
00:42:50,118 --> 00:42:50,680
Speaker 1: That was amazing.

670
00:42:50,743 --> 00:42:53,588
Speaker 1: I'm good I think delicious star and then you're full.

671
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:58,204
Speaker 1: but if you eat fist of the North Star is delicious steak or you eat it And you're just hungrier.

672
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:00,513
Speaker 0: fist of the North Star does a better job.

673
00:43:00,533 --> 00:43:02,480
Speaker 0: They're both like trains going somewhere.

674
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:09,800
Speaker 0: but Joe Joe's you can't tell where the trains going at all unless you know a lot about the Joe Joe verse.

675
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:16,127
Speaker 0: But this is the North Star does a good job of pointing out like trains kind of going in this direction Like you can see where this trains going.

676
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:17,815
Speaker 0: you want to go where this trains going.

677
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:21,580
Speaker 1: I will go I will ride that kentro train wherever it goes.

678
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,883
Speaker 0: But like you get on the Joe Joe train and then just like cars start falling off into pits and they're like They're like station.

679
00:43:28,903 --> 00:43:31,131
Speaker 1: stop New York and I'm like, oh, it's my stop.

680
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:33,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you're like, what's the next stop?

681
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:34,909
Speaker 0: Poughkeepsie.

682
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:35,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, fuck that.

683
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,815
Speaker 0: So there's a bunch of shows that I watched a bunch of just because I was stupid and I was.

684
00:43:43,296 --> 00:43:44,340
Speaker 1: I haven't had that problem.

685
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:50,224
Speaker 0: Well, like when anime was not super easy to come by or when I first got to RIT anime There's probably the worst.

686
00:43:50,406 --> 00:43:53,866
Speaker 0: there's two times in my life where I watch a lot of three times There's a lot of bad anime.

687
00:43:53,886 --> 00:44:12,424
Speaker 0: the one times when I watch reader died TV because I was a little into the woods the time before that was when I got to RIT and got access to the RIT anime library because All the great classics of anime as far as the previous generation to us of anime fans was concerned Was there.

688
00:44:12,907 --> 00:44:20,194
Speaker 0: so I had all these senpais coming to me and being like oh Marmalade boy is a super important anime and you should watch it.

689
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:21,720
Speaker 1: I actually didn't watch any of it.

690
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, Marmalade boy, not a good show.

691
00:44:25,277 --> 00:44:27,211
Speaker 1: Oh I hope they're listening.

692
00:44:27,393 --> 00:44:32,297
Speaker 1: Yeah How about that Kimogori orange road that they love so much?

693
00:44:32,357 --> 00:44:32,880
Speaker 0: oh my god.

694
00:44:33,381 --> 00:44:39,760
Speaker 0: So I liked Kimogori orange road a lot, but I also stopped watching it because it's not good.

695
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,285
Speaker 1: How about that?

696
00:44:40,507 --> 00:44:41,173
Speaker 1: Please save my earth.

697
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:42,723
Speaker 1: They love so much I was.

698
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,309
Speaker 0: so I was really into.

699
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:51,830
Speaker 0: please save my earth because it was the first show I've seen that had like the really really deep secretive space with a lot of like.

700
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:53,756
Speaker 0: it looked real deep and like.

701
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:55,828
Speaker 0: there was a lot to chew on and analyze.

702
00:44:55,848 --> 00:45:07,620
Speaker 0: and Then I got to the end of the show and I was like, oh Not only did they not get to explaining all of it But what little they explained is really dumb kind of like attack on Titan.

703
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:09,386
Speaker 1: So you bring up the anime club library.

704
00:45:09,426 --> 00:45:17,440
Speaker 1: that makes me remember there were shows that I was getting tapes of weekly and then stopped And the number one of those was card capture Sakura.

705
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:17,560
Speaker 1: I was.

706
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:22,179
Speaker 1: it was just such a famous show at the time and I just started watching and I didn't disenjoy it.

707
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:33,260
Speaker 1: I just you know I only could get two tapes a week and I stopped choosing that one because there were other choices and one of the choices I Picked it was on the best shows ever, which is pat laboire, right?

708
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,519
Speaker 1: that time I Didn't finish the show.

709
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,140
Speaker 1: I actually went back and finished it later in life.

710
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,931
Speaker 1: And the reason I didn't finish it was because those VHS tapes they had.

711
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:44,733
Speaker 1: I don't

712
00:45:44,774 --> 00:45:45,335
Speaker 0: know why

713
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:59,347
Speaker 1: I think I heard from somewhere that They were just direct rips of the laserdisc and that they were structured in such a way that you would get one OAV episode and then like two or three TV episodes and then the second OAV Episode and then two or three.

714
00:45:59,368 --> 00:46:01,740
Speaker 1: so like the order was all fucked up.

715
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,471
Speaker 1: But I couldn't really a hundred percent follow everything that was happening.

716
00:46:05,491 --> 00:46:18,359
Speaker 1: and when I was able to rewatch it years later And see that is the best thing ever I was watched the first OAV first TV the second, you know I watched it in the correct viewing order and was able to get everything out of it.

717
00:46:19,942 --> 00:46:24,200
Speaker 1: So that's actually a show that I stopped watching and did go back and finish later.

718
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:31,560
Speaker 1: but I think that might be one of the only ones where the shows that you stopped watching and Then actually did go back to and watch the whole thing at another point

719
00:46:32,482 --> 00:46:40,165
Speaker 0: You know, there's a whole separate class of shows of the shows that are really good or funny and really long But are so episodic that they're.

720
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:45,500
Speaker 0: they're like a Seinfeld where you're not gonna marathon a season of Seinfeld or Lupin.

721
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:55,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna watch an episode like Nichijou like I probably have seen every episode of Nichijou I haven't but in a completely random order because I'll just be like.

722
00:46:56,121 --> 00:47:00,140
Speaker 1: I just saw goat gifts and I watched a couple episodes and I didn't see any goats and I'm like, alright, I'm done.

723
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:01,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think.

724
00:47:01,393 --> 00:47:03,743
Speaker 0: well, I Like the show a lot.

725
00:47:03,763 --> 00:47:04,767
Speaker 0: There's some good stuff in there.

726
00:47:04,848 --> 00:47:07,056
Speaker 0: But like Ranma, Urisei and Sura.

727
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:07,940
Speaker 0: I love both their shows.

728
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,653
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've only seen like a handful of Ranma's.

729
00:47:09,774 --> 00:47:12,478
Speaker 1: I've seen like two Urisei and Sura's.

730
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:19,030
Speaker 0: I've seen a ton of Urisei and Sura and I've read most of the manga that was released in English at least in the old Days or like Gintama is like that too.

731
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,160
Speaker 1: Like I really thought Meizani Koku was the manga.

732
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,626
Speaker 0: Meizani Koku has a serial plot.

733
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:26,516
Speaker 0: Urisei and Sura is just nonsense.

734
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:27,740
Speaker 1: Oh, it's so much better.

735
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:28,282
Speaker 1: Yeah,

736
00:47:28,704 --> 00:47:34,399
Speaker 0: actually it is because you can pick a random episode and watch it and I guess they count because I have not seen every episode of these shows

737
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,003
Speaker 1: but

738
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:42,579
Speaker 0: I really like them and I feel like actually I should just start picking up random episodes and watching them again.

739
00:47:42,781 --> 00:47:44,311
Speaker 1: I feel like I should watch Urisei and Sura in order.

740
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:47,436
Speaker 0: Uh We could just start cranking them out in a week.

741
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,246
Speaker 0: Sure, I did when it went.

742
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:53,260
Speaker 0: yeah, I watched the first five or so in a row a few years ago.

743
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,606
Speaker 0: Then I just stopped for some reason.

744
00:47:54,627 --> 00:47:55,310
Speaker 0: I think I got busy.

745
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:55,873
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

746
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:58,646
Speaker 0: Uh Then there was Sailor Moon Crystal.

747
00:47:58,666 --> 00:47:59,410
Speaker 0: That was just bad.

748
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:00,456
Speaker 1: It's a different story.

749
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:06,227
Speaker 0: Uh I've never actually seen The you know, the Landsman movie like the anime.

750
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:07,611
Speaker 1: I thought you owned it on VHS.

751
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never seen the entire thing in one go.

752
00:48:12,301 --> 00:48:16,620
Speaker 0: I've seen every part of it, but I've shown it to people so many times.

753
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,587
Speaker 0: But then I'd like leave the room or fall asleep.

754
00:48:18,988 --> 00:48:22,139
Speaker 0: that I've never watched it awake from beginning to end in my entire life.

755
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:25,019
Speaker 1: That's really strange Yeah.

756
00:48:25,341 --> 00:48:30,900
Speaker 0: But I've seen every minute of footage in the movie or at least in the dub that I taped off of the sci-fi channel.

757
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,835
Speaker 1: That's really weird.

758
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:37,800
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, it is really weird, but I did stands out in my mind.

759
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,059
Speaker 0: I almost feel like I should never watch it because I'd always fall asleep.

760
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:47,465
Speaker 0: Especially there's that part at the end where he's on that like he's with the green guys flying Kind of like near the last battle.

761
00:48:47,826 --> 00:48:51,960
Speaker 0: I always wake up with the green guy flying really fast through that scene near the end.

762
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:55,832
Speaker 0: So whatever I'd miss in that middle, I'm just gonna wake up at the green guy flying.

763
00:48:55,852 --> 00:48:57,919
Speaker 0: I'd be like, well that happened again.

764
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:04,556
Speaker 1: Okay I've started reading the lens of in novels and I read a bunch of them, but I didn't finish all of them.

765
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:06,258
Speaker 1: No Does that count?

766
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:09,692
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm just because I wrote down a bunch of shows.

767
00:49:09,712 --> 00:49:14,967
Speaker 0: so great teacher Onizuka I was oh, yeah That's a classic show that I was like.

768
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:18,680
Speaker 1: I started reading watching the show and reading the manga and didn't finish either one.

769
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was super into it cuz it was really funny and then Nothing new happened.

770
00:49:24,012 --> 00:49:25,080
Speaker 1: It didn't have staying power.

771
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:29,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, like they ran out of jokes and they just got more and more perverted and I didn't care anymore.

772
00:49:29,776 --> 00:49:29,977
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

773
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,653
Speaker 0: Well, there was another show that I was really into her.

774
00:49:34,256 --> 00:49:37,488
Speaker 0: Uh, the one Boy the boys over flowers.

775
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:40,840
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah originally anime anime.

776
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:46,500
Speaker 1: I think if I'm gonna watch that I'm gonna watch the live-action drama version from country of choice.

777
00:49:47,124 --> 00:49:49,360
Speaker 1: I want the Korean one of the Japanese one is better.

778
00:49:49,482 --> 00:49:58,794
Speaker 0: I watched the anime pretty much all the way up until people started dating and Then the show kind of ran out of steam because I didn't care anymore about any of the people.

779
00:49:59,015 --> 00:50:00,340
Speaker 1: anime was way strong in the beginning.

780
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,360
Speaker 1: And yeah with the f4 that's what it's about no matter which version you watch.

781
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:07,936
Speaker 0: Actually, you know what that show and Nana both had that same problem like Nana.

782
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:15,911
Speaker 0: I didn't finish either Yeah, because Nana was great and then it got to a point like wow Every character is an amazing person except Nana who's actually really boring.

783
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:23,232
Speaker 0: and now this is just becoming like baby mama drama This like basic girl ruining her life and making poor decisions.

784
00:50:23,573 --> 00:50:25,619
Speaker 0: This is like some made-for-tv nonsense.

785
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:28,611
Speaker 1: now All right, you have any more.

786
00:50:28,631 --> 00:50:32,891
Speaker 1: I think I'm running out I'm running low here And I'm sure there's more I can't think of.

787
00:50:33,192 --> 00:50:34,780
Speaker 0: I used to go to anime club marathons.

788
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:39,305
Speaker 0: You know we drive her like every at least once a month on over a weekend And I went to them

789
00:50:39,325 --> 00:50:42,800
Speaker 1: a lot less often is than you, but when I did go I usually saw the whole thing

790
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:49,400
Speaker 0: Yep, but the first one where I left as opposed to watching the whole show was actually a magic Knights rare.

791
00:50:50,242 --> 00:50:51,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't go to that at all.

792
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:51,974
Speaker 0: so I went.

793
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:52,820
Speaker 1: I have the manga.

794
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,885
Speaker 1: I only read the first volume.

795
00:50:53,905 --> 00:50:56,557
Speaker 0: it was another one of those famous shows that a lot of people are super into.

796
00:50:56,597 --> 00:50:58,632
Speaker 0: hard to follow Yeah, so I watched.

797
00:50:58,673 --> 00:50:59,480
Speaker 0: like the first nine.

798
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:06,880
Speaker 0: I was the manga is hard to follow and then I went outside to like at a snack And it was real warm and nice outside because it was during the summer just didn't go back.

799
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,925
Speaker 0: So I just I was like.

800
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:08,407
Speaker 0: you know what.

801
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:11,704
Speaker 0: there are things more important than anime Mm-hmm?

802
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:14,280
Speaker 0: well no there's things more important than Magic Knight rare.

803
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:17,556
Speaker 0: If that had been Evangelion I would've been right back in that room.

804
00:51:17,697 --> 00:51:18,079
Speaker 0: That's right.

805

Speaker 0: Daniel Redman Chris a dad Doug Schneider Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

820
00:52:55,933 --> 00:52:58,530
Speaker 0: We're actually getting pretty much back into the swing of things.

821
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:03,109
Speaker 0: We've got magfest four days, which might prevent us from doing a Thursday show next week.

822
00:53:03,671 --> 00:53:10,710
Speaker 0: But after that we pretty much got nothing until like PAX East and Connecticut and anime Boston and all that nonsense.

823
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:14,245
Speaker 0: So pretty much a hundred percent back on geek night schedule.

824
00:53:14,285 --> 00:53:19,290
Speaker 0: for the foreseeable future I'll have the two packs videos up as soon as I get at least one utenna up.

825
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:26,418
Speaker 0: Then I'll get the second utenna up since we actually recorded episodes 14 and 15 the other weekend when we had our film shoot This coming weekend.

826
00:53:26,438 --> 00:53:36,550
Speaker 0: We might record episodes 15 16. if we can't even 17 because the more video I get recorded Then it's just a matter of me having the time to actually edit it all together.

827
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:41,004
Speaker 0: And as I've said repeatedly I have the new knob so I might be able to do it pretty quickly.

828
00:53:41,546 --> 00:53:51,670
Speaker 0: and now I leave for you something that's kind of amazing and It's particularly amazing if you watch the movie, but only watch this one part entirely out of context.

829
00:53:52,252 --> 00:53:54,282
Speaker 1: I'm a lucky young man.

830
00:53:54,543 --> 00:53:59,629
Speaker 1: Oh, I have a piano That'll take us away from it all.
