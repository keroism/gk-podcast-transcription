Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,706
Speaker 0: It's time for a tech news roundup.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,790
Speaker 0: I Get so excited when I can do a tech news roundup.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,534
Speaker 0: It means I got some.

7
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:25,948
Speaker 0: I don't have to worry about coming up with a Monday show.

8
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:27,475
Speaker 1: You hit for a one year.

9
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:28,198
Speaker 1: you can tell.

10
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:37,030
Speaker 0: all I got to do is go to slash dot which I don't recommend you going To because the people who use slash shot or troglodyte thought there are terrifying people in the slash shot comments.

11
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:40,330
Speaker 0: But it is a good list of the stories to talk about that.

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,269
Speaker 0: I can go find real links to them when I actually post the show.

13
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:47,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, so actually I got a tech opening bit.

14
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:51,790
Speaker 1: So as you know pretty much everyone's trapped at home, right?

15
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:55,782
Speaker 1: So of all people my brother messages me like this morning.

16
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:59,305
Speaker 1: I see a text message, and he's it says literally Here's the text message.

17
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:01,382
Speaker 1: Where is it?

18
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,574
Speaker 1: Build me a PC.

19
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:05,838
Speaker 1: That's all it says.

20
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:12,331
Speaker 0: I mean sure send me a check for $5,000.

21
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:17,090
Speaker 1: It's like this is a person who hasn't had a PC in I don't know how many years.

22
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,417
Speaker 1: He just gets by with his iPad, and I think he had a MacBook at one point, but it's so old It's not worth.

23
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:23,710
Speaker 1: You know doesn't do anything anymore.

24
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:24,294
Speaker 0: I would like that.

25
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:25,846
Speaker 0: is he gonna game on it or like?

26
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:29,193
Speaker 1: yeah He wants to play games and I guess Whatever.

27
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:32,150
Speaker 0: I don't know Falcon Northwest or something or alien.

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,002
Speaker 1: I was like maybe goodbye a Microsoft Surface or something.

29
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,408
Speaker 1: right you'll be fine with that.

30
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:36,950
Speaker 1: I don't know.

31
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,868
Speaker 1: He's like building a PC.

32
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:42,760
Speaker 1: It's like cuz I remember when we were kids.

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,330
Speaker 1: You know I was the PC person.

34
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:45,962
Speaker 1: He was there with his like n64 in the late 90s.

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,434
Speaker 1: He didn't.

36
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:55,210
Speaker 1: he PC'd later And most of his PCing was like he played Warcraft 3 with like the actual original dota mod, right?

37
00:01:55,635 --> 00:02:04,107
Speaker 0: We were actually both like my brother And I were both primarily PC gaming and NES SNES like that generation And we both kind of ditched consoles after that.

38
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:11,679
Speaker 1: for a while He played a lot of counter-strike, but then after that after you know he went to college, and then he pretty much You know stopped PCing.

39
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,990
Speaker 1: I don't think he had a piece other than that one MacBook.

40
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:16,149
Speaker 1: I don't think he's had a PC, but now he's trapped at home.

41
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:18,550
Speaker 1: Now suddenly he wants a real computer.

42
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:28,226
Speaker 1: He wants me to like put it together for all it is if you design it and put it together Then if there's any problem with it No, but I was like you know hey, you know how much money.

43
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:29,010
Speaker 1: This is gonna cost you.

44
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,129
Speaker 1: You don't have any computer parts.

45
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:30,892
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to buy.

46
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:34,966
Speaker 1: you know monitors mice keyboards Microsoft Windows.

47
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,334
Speaker 1: you gotta buy all kinds of stuff That you don't have.

48
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:43,717
Speaker 0: funnily enough one of my co-workers wants to build a gaming PC for his kid And yeah, he's actually pretty savvy.

49
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:46,608
Speaker 0: He just hasn't built a gaming PC in like 10 15 years.

50
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,525
Speaker 1: If you've built a PC ever you can build one now.

51
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:50,606
Speaker 1: yep.

52
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:52,776
Speaker 0: So mostly he was just trying to figure out.

53
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:54,262
Speaker 0: and the funny thing is he asked me.

54
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:59,540
Speaker 0: all he asked me is he's like so Are those AMD chips any good?

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,910
Speaker 0: because the last time I tried you said everyone's buying these days.

56
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,270
Speaker 0: I guess they seem like they work these days like I don't trust them enough.

57
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,878
Speaker 1: I already still don't trust them, but people keep buying them.

58
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:20,095
Speaker 0: so I see there are credible stories of people making AMD like Ryzen gaming PCs that post on the first attempt which sure I guess that's true I guess AMD.

59
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:25,720
Speaker 1: You know is because they're behind right there where they were behind Since they fell out of favor.

60
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,028
Speaker 1: They've been trying hard.

61
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:29,457
Speaker 0: meanwhile Intel is not pushed forward very right.

62
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:40,756
Speaker 1: Intel has been I think hindered in a lot of ways You know and I think Intel tried to foray into a lot of other Segments and markets and failed.

63
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:41,218
Speaker 1: you know.

64
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,566
Speaker 1: if you look at like you know all mobile chips.

65
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:44,769
Speaker 1: Intel did not win.

66
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,779
Speaker 0: Also apartment we hit another plateau of like.

67
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,749
Speaker 0: there are physical realities that prevent us from building stuff.

68
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:52,098
Speaker 1: Graphics chips.

69
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,790
Speaker 1: Intel did not win that department.

70
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,268
Speaker 1: They're trying to go up against GeForce with their video and video with their video cards not really going great.

71
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,448
Speaker 1: Yeah You know who knows?

72
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,680
Speaker 1: So yeah, maybe you know I mean nothing's invincible right.

73
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,646
Speaker 0: I mean that's why he mentioning that.

74
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:14,455
Speaker 0: that's why when people ask me I don't say oh Intel definitely I say my experiences are with Intel, but I do point people like hey You can look at this AMD area.

75
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:15,117
Speaker 0: just be warned.

76
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,505
Speaker 0: I'm not building another PC for nine years.

77
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:20,196
Speaker 0: so in nine years I'll see if AMD's are any good.

78
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:22,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, my brother might end up getting the AMD.

79
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,150
Speaker 1: who knows it's not my computer We're not my problem.

80
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:34,028
Speaker 0: You know I might actually try it out because the one I will have to build a new HTPC sometime this year the one in the living room from 2009 is Starting to have some problems.

81
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:37,950
Speaker 1: I just wonder how he wants to do like is he what gonna ship all these parts to my apartment?

82
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:39,623
Speaker 1: I put it together then he comes and gets it.

83
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:44,300
Speaker 1: or Gonna like You expect me to come there.

84
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,406
Speaker 1: I told him to do it himself.

85
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:48,112
Speaker 0: He's like no It's it's lit It is.

86
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:50,202
Speaker 0: this is like the Golden Age of it's.

87
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:51,528
Speaker 0: easy to put these things together.

88
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:51,830
Speaker 0: the heart.

89
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:54,910
Speaker 1: You got a lot of time to figure it out too from YouTube.

90
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:55,290
Speaker 1: Yeah

91
00:04:55,692 --> 00:05:12,370
Speaker 0: plus nowadays if there would have been a video that would have showed me how to put the heatsink on my Thunderbird without breaking the motherboard and I know right if a video had said listen You're just gonna sound like you're breaking it Just keep trucking on and I could see a video of someone making that horrible noise without breaking it.

92
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,165
Speaker 0: I would have felt a lot better about that thing on.

93
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,777
Speaker 0: I was Terrified of putting that heatsink on that AMD.

94
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:23,408
Speaker 0: what a Thunderbird gigahertz that I got an RIT to replace the 800 that died.

95
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:27,737
Speaker 0: yep, but Let's get right into it.

96
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:32,269
Speaker 0: It's time for a tech news roundup, so we're not gonna talk about news We're just gonna go right into.

97
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:33,817
Speaker 1: Well, I got some.

98
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:35,670
Speaker 0: oh you got some more opening bits.

99
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,253
Speaker 1: Well, I got.

100
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:43,160
Speaker 1: I have a you know, since we're putting all the news in the main bit Yeah, I got some sort of semi geek bite that is technology related.

101
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:43,842
Speaker 1: Ooh, right.

102
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:48,394
Speaker 1: So there's this thing called a Jupiter notebook.

103
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:48,977
Speaker 1: Have you heard of this?

104
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,364
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I use the hell out of that at work.

105
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:51,208
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

106
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:58,370
Speaker 1: Yeah Okay, you don't know about you know looks it's a big deal with like, you know Python especially right where our data analysis.

107
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:09,330
Speaker 0: Like if you got a business analyst who there's a data set and you want them to fuck with the data set Okay, you're probably using those features where you know, you're putting graphs mixed in with the code and also the text, right?

108
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:17,829
Speaker 0: Yep, or just like maybe they're gonna do some data analysis to then structure the data for import in some other system And they're gonna write all the code to do that.

109
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:20,327
Speaker 0: This is what they use to kind of fuck around with the data.

110
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:24,890
Speaker 0: I was like it's like two or three steps above using Excel or any of those tools.

111
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:27,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wanted to use it to communicate with my co-workers, right?

112
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,450
Speaker 1: Like I could make a little notebook and send it to them to demonstrate what I was trying to tell them.

113
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,762
Speaker 1: You know code wise, right?

114
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:39,129
Speaker 1: Yeah But so, you know setting that up wasn't so wasn't very tricky at all.

115
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:40,986
Speaker 1: Just install it and run it.

116
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:42,393
Speaker 1: The thing is.

117
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:43,457
Speaker 1: the way it works is it's.

118
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:47,550
Speaker 1: it's one of those things where nobody these days wants to make a desktop app.

119
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:49,733
Speaker 1: Everyone wants to make a web app Yeah, but it's all.

120
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:54,409
Speaker 1: you run it locally which means it runs its own web server and then opens your browser and there it is.

121
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,492
Speaker 0: Yep, it's.

122
00:06:55,673 --> 00:07:00,767
Speaker 0: uh, the only reason I'm okay with it is that other people do that part for me.

123
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:08,567
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so the thing is not really about the Jupiter notebook It's about that want to talk about because that's just use it if you want.

124
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:13,383
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool Yeah, is that I'm using for all my development work home end at work.

125
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:15,610
Speaker 1: I use Windows subsystem for Linux, right?

126
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:22,910
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, all my code and this notebook included would be running in this sort of semi not Windows Linux land, right?

127
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:30,730
Speaker 1: But then what happens is when I run it It starts a web server in the Linux land and it's fine because that's still localhost the port that it's on.

128
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then I it's.

129
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:36,610
Speaker 1: it tries to open my browser and visit the web server automatically.

130
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I could just open up my browser.

131
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,184
Speaker 1: in the real I want to.

132
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:43,797
Speaker 1: I don't want to use some Firefox That's installed in the fake Linux.

133
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:50,430
Speaker 1: Hell no, right in in the fake in the X server on Windows I want to go to my real Windows web browser and visit.

134
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:56,415
Speaker 1: So I could do that by typing in the link which in the Windows Browser, but that sucks.

135
00:07:56,435 --> 00:08:00,650
Speaker 1: who wants to copy and paste a link every frickin time from the terminal over to the browser, right?

136
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:03,109
Speaker 1: So I found it a handy trick.

137
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:09,178
Speaker 1: There's apparently a package called WUSL or I think is what it was called.

138
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:19,290
Speaker 1: But anyway, it had like a Little program that was like WSL open or something, right?

139
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,018
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's the exact acronym.

140
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:23,761
Speaker 1: It's something like that.

141
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,187
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm googling for it.

142
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:25,568
Speaker 0: I give up.

143
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:37,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically it was really crazy that I'm in this fake Linux and I type this thing and I press enter And it opens up the browser in the windows.

144
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:40,380
Speaker 0: You know go back to a younger.

145
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,727
Speaker 0: I'm working at IBM circa 2003.

146
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:45,035
Speaker 0: That would have been witchcraft Right.

147
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:52,990
Speaker 0: It's like I was running it Wine like wine to try to put like hacked DLLs to make Windows shit run on Linux.

148
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,570
Speaker 1: Right the Linux that I'm using is basically is literally actually bash dot exe.

149
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,134
Speaker 1: So it's bash dot exe.

150
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:10,262
Speaker 1: it runs and I'm using the bash dot exe and I type a command and that runs Firefox dot exe Outside of the bash dot exe.

151
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:17,028
Speaker 0: Well, if you just went back to me circa 2003 and just said bash dot exe will be a real thing I wouldn't have believed you.

152
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:32,310
Speaker 1: yeah, so I set some environment variables and I changed some settings in the Jupiter config and now when I run the Jupiter notebook it Run, it starts a web server in the fake Linux and then my real web browser in Windows opens a new tab aimed at it.

153
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,055
Speaker 1: Not too shabby.

154
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:35,421
Speaker 1: That's what I did today, but it was.

155
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,846
Speaker 1: you know, you know, it's funny at work.

156
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:51,775
Speaker 0: I actually wish I had more time to fuck around with these Jupiter notebooks because you know I'm I'm not supposed to be fucking with the technology I'm supposed to be like strategizing but like I see the things people are doing in there with these data sets And I just really want to play around.

157
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:59,899
Speaker 1: all it really is is a is an editor to make documents But you can put code in the documents but the code is attached to.

158
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,967
Speaker 1: you have a basically a server running that will Execute the code and you could rerun the code or move the code around.

159
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,185
Speaker 0: So if you have a giant you can just put that database there and write some code.

160
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:22,508
Speaker 1: interface with the database Right, and then you can take the outputs from the code you ran and pass them to other objects in the document like graphs and charts Visualizations or whatever, but other than that is just you know.

161
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:24,194
Speaker 1: Documents, right.

162
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:25,519
Speaker 1: so you and you make the documents.

163
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:30,910
Speaker 1: you can send them to someone else and then when they open it on their end Right, they open up this document.

164
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:36,990
Speaker 1: They can now interact with the code and the things in the document because it's running live code interpreter.

165
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:42,170
Speaker 0: Anyone listening to this who is like trying to learn Python just play with this thing.

166
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,370
Speaker 0: This thing actually is also a pretty cool place just to like fuck around with basic Python and learn like basic techniques.

167
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:50,041
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it makes it easy.

168
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:55,370
Speaker 0: You're not trying to write a whole application You're just you've written some Python code to interact with a structure that already exists.

169
00:10:55,874 --> 00:11:01,545
Speaker 1: It also helps you make pretty nice you know documentation for certain things because you can eat when you're in the editor.

170
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:06,722
Speaker 1: you can easily save as La tech or PDF or all kinds of formats.

171
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:17,750
Speaker 1: and you know, like if you put a Jupyter notebook document for example in a git repository and push it to github and you go to github and you click on that document.

172
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:21,621
Speaker 1: GitHub runs it in the jupyter viewer and there it is.

173
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:27,060
Speaker 1: Yeah in all its fancy enos ways Instead of just seeing the source of the document.

174
00:11:27,342 --> 00:11:27,644
Speaker 1: Yep.

175
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:31,440
Speaker 0: So man I don't even have a single Linux box running in my house right now.

176
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,267
Speaker 1: Just use Windows subsystem for Linux.

177
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:37,423
Speaker 1: I could yeah I guess I guess what technically runs Linux in this house.

178
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:39,110
Speaker 1: Maybe the Nintendo switch run Linux?

179
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,834
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

180
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:42,246
Speaker 0: Maybe my nasus thing might be based on Linux.

181
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:42,769
Speaker 0: I forget what that.

182
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:44,518
Speaker 1: oh, yes My Synology runs Linux.

183
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:46,127
Speaker 1: that router probably does.

184
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:46,569
Speaker 1: maybe.

185
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:51,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a weird Verizon gave me a weird router now, so I don't know.

186
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:53,414
Speaker 1: Okay.

187
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:55,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not my old WRT.

188
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:55,490
Speaker 0: whatever.

189
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:08,267
Speaker 0: No, but whatever all right, but anyway now I guess it is time for Things of the day.

190
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:09,771
Speaker 0: What do you got?

191
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:19,920
Speaker 1: So we were at magfest and I saw panel on the schedule I think I've talked about on the show before previously classic Japanese PC games digital history behind barriers.

192
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:37,827
Speaker 1: right because the story is you know, I think all computer nerds and we sort of know this intuitively if but not Explicitly is that in the 80s 90s, right, you know the computers that were around the world, you know The the UK and Europe had a lot of.

193
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:42,620
Speaker 1: you know things like, you know, ZX spectrums and Commodores and not amigas, right?

194
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,911
Speaker 0: Yeah, not everyone in like Windows on x86.

195
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:47,055
Speaker 1: right in the u.s.

196
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:53,860
Speaker 1: We had Macs apples You know Windows IBM PCs, right and in Japan they had PCs.

197
00:12:54,041 --> 00:13:03,760
Speaker 1: But they were things like, you know with the thing that Metal Gear I did the MSX and you know The the tiger the the turbo graphics 16 with it was like the PC engine, right?

198
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd always heard all the MSX but I didn't know that it was a computer like a computer computer.

199
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:09,688
Speaker 0: I was a computer.

200
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,840
Speaker 1: it was a computer standard.

201
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know there were lots of different computers that were all basically MSX compatible and they all ran the same.

202
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,380
Speaker 0: Mostly they were upgraded one, but my brain sex to my kid brain thought it was a gaming console because of Metal Gear.

203
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:24,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, right exactly.

204
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:30,060
Speaker 1: But basically, yeah, and there was what they call it is the Galapagos syndrome.

205
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:33,000
Speaker 1: Is this what this guy calls it which is like a perfect description, right?

206
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,319
Speaker 1: You think the island of Galapagos where Darwin went and saw the weird animals?

207
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:44,790
Speaker 1: Animals had been there somewhat separated from the rest of the world because they were near an island and they evolved Separately from the rest of the world.

208
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:53,320
Speaker 1: So in the 80s and 90s Japan's PC ecosystem was evolving on its own separate from the rest of the world, right?

209
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:57,099
Speaker 1: You know be mostly because for a wide variety of reasons, right?

210
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:13,193
Speaker 1: You know culture language all sorts of things and as a result all of the games Which is what we nerds are interested in that were made for Japanese PCs Were never ported never brought over, you know before emulators.

211
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:21,500
Speaker 0: You couldn't write good thing before emulation Like some of the stuff you'd worry about like Indian problems and nonsense like that all kinds of crazy stuff.

212
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,965
Speaker 1: Basically, there was a in.

213
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:34,540
Speaker 1: there were years and years and years where there were piles and piles and piles of amazing pieces of Software made in Japan for a variety of Japanese only computer PC platforms.

214
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,324
Speaker 1: Right, and I always knew that they were there but I didn't know much about it and couldn't learn much about it Didn't speak Japanese?

215
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:41,826
Speaker 1: still don't.

216
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:52,380
Speaker 1: and this guy did a panel where he's gonna you know Share that info and I was like damn I am going to that panel and I caught the tail end of it And even that last bit was fantastic, right?

217
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,200
Speaker 1: So the video of the panel is now online and I thought the quality was gonna be low.

218
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,045
Speaker 1: The lighting quality is low.

219
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:01,934
Speaker 1: you it's kind of a dark room, but you can still.

220
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:03,860
Speaker 1: the audio is actually really great.

221
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,756
Speaker 1: You can hear everything he's saying pretty clearly.

222
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:12,501
Speaker 0: I mean props to a cold guy and the magfest staff for like every year the video they do on their own has gotten better and Better.

223
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:15,417
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a but you can sort of see what's on the projector mostly.

224
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:19,900
Speaker 1: Yeah You know, but yeah, it's like this is literally just a cheapo camcorder.

225
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:23,580
Speaker 1: They set up in the corner and push a button and don't really try to you know.

226
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:28,539
Speaker 1: But yeah, great great panel here for you to watch but the panel's not the thing of the day.

227
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,760
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is that at the very beginning of the panel?

228
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,366
Speaker 1: He says who was brought here by PC 98 bot.

229
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:37,614
Speaker 1: ha any any lesser people to raise their hands.

230
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:50,530
Speaker 1: So PC 98 bot is a Twitter bot that every four hours posts an image or gif of Some sort of game usually a weeb game.

231
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:52,285
Speaker 0: This is attention.

232
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:53,068
Speaker 0: Oh, you're right here.

233
00:15:53,089 --> 00:16:01,204
Speaker 1: Yeah from the NEC PC 98 gaming, you know computer platform Which apparently had shit.

234
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:24,245
Speaker 1: tons of games made for it that you've never seen and probably never will see and probably never will play Ever almost any of these games, but there are some really amazing games here, you know The likes of which you know lots of visual novels lots of stretch term Dave strategy games RPGs all kinds of games some some revolutionary That you've never seen or heard of.

235
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:30,736
Speaker 1: most of them almost all of them and this Twitter account tweets images from them on the daily.

236
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:41,640
Speaker 1: so if you want to get a taste of what was going on in Japan in You know the mid-late 90s on the PCs that they had follow this Twitter account.

237
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:51,820
Speaker 0: alright, so I Saw this video talking about a virus that does something so crazy that I felt like I really need more virus talk right now.

238
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,372
Speaker 0: Well, this is a virus that does not in any way harm humans.

239
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:55,880
Speaker 0: In fact, it is a bacteriophage.

240
00:16:56,101 --> 00:17:00,238
Speaker 0: So it kills and eat and effectively eats from the inside out bacteria.

241
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:00,700
Speaker 0: It's not a threat.

242
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:06,976
Speaker 1: Could we make a bacteriophage that kills say, I don't know all the bacterial illnesses in the world.

243
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:13,440
Speaker 0: There are actually Phage therapies, I think they were mostly pioneered in the Soviet Union, but they exist.

244
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:15,069
Speaker 0: They're still under research.

245
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,538
Speaker 0: like that is a promising field.

246
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:24,679
Speaker 0: Okay, bacteriophages because you know, if you if you don't remember your high school biology You know the little virus that looks like a little man with like little legs and a little head.

247
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,686
Speaker 1: It's those like a space lander.

248
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,575
Speaker 1: Yeah gonna land on some planet somewhere.

249
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:28,736
Speaker 0: Yep.

250
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:35,164
Speaker 1: It's got a little diamond It's got a d20 for a head and then some alien body and then some walking legs Like it's gonna come at you.

251
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:37,010
Speaker 0: Yep, like a little spider insect guy.

252
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,449
Speaker 0: So this virus dubbed the 5kz jumbo phage.

253
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:44,160
Speaker 0: it's one of those weird big boy.

254
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:44,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

255
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:48,077
Speaker 0: It's one of those weird big boy viruses like but it's still a really small boy.

256
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:50,086
Speaker 1: because the virus Yeah, it's bigger than the other virus.

257
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:56,280
Speaker 0: but like there are some viruses that are like so tiny It's not clear how they manage to survive in the wild on their own at all.

258
00:17:56,822 --> 00:18:02,460
Speaker 0: Then there's big viruses that are so big they're like ridiculous compared to what you think of as the normal virus.

259
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:04,124
Speaker 0: These are weird biggens.

260
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:10,020
Speaker 0: But the thing that's crazy about them is that bacteria basically have no way to fight them off.

261
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,046
Speaker 0: They're like invincible Mm-hmm and what they do.

262
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,512
Speaker 0: and this videos three like.

263
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:20,300
Speaker 1: so even even if you break it up Even if the bacteria somehow like, you know breaks it into the enemy into pieces.

264
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:29,159
Speaker 0: it's still well more like all the ways like bacteria have all these different ways to fight viruses because Viruses are attacking them constantly and they're really good at killing viruses.

265
00:18:29,762 --> 00:18:34,920
Speaker 0: But this virus does something that as far as I can tell and this video is these are experts who know way more about this.

266
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,059
Speaker 1: Then why don't we make a bacteria that can fight the corona?

267
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:44,429
Speaker 1: Well, it's like we're basically getting in and it's like a bacteria virus war going on around the whole world all the time that we Can't see.

268
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:52,860
Speaker 1: like a toner We're sort of and we're joining in on it trying to help one side or the other So that any of the combatants in the war that are harmful to humans always lose.

269
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:00,153
Speaker 0: If I've learned anything from any of the the political games we've ever played if other people are in a war do not fucking get involved in that war.

270
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:06,177
Speaker 0: No particular sieve game is coming to mind where I tried to help somebody out and I saw where it got me.

271
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:12,140
Speaker 0: Yep But anyway, what this virus does is it gets into the bacteria?

272
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,554
Speaker 0: Note that just in case you don't remember your high school biology bacteria do not have nuclei.

273
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:19,079
Speaker 0: There's no nucleus in a bacterium.

274
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:28,117
Speaker 0: No, the virus makes its own nuclei and hides inside of the nuclei and Controls the bacteria from in there.

275
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:31,232
Speaker 0: Okay, so none of the things the bacteria has.

276
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:33,080
Speaker 0: because the bacteria they don't have nuclei.

277
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:39,240
Speaker 0: They don't need an ability to like get inside of a nucleus to detect DNA damage or like fight with something.

278
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:48,975
Speaker 0: so the virus makes a nuclei and turns the bacteria into like Basically a mech suit that it wears like it's.

279
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,083
Speaker 0: it's just really amazing This video does.

280
00:19:51,444 --> 00:20:03,940
Speaker 0: the reason I'm making this my thing of the day is that this is actually a really really complicated thing That my high school like AP biology knowledge Barely gets me to the point of being able to describe and I'm probably already wrong about ten things.

281
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:12,660
Speaker 0: but the way the Elegance with which this less than four minute video explains this and explains why it's so awesome is why I'm making it the thing of.

282
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,089
Speaker 0: This is like a plus internet content.

283
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:25,539
Speaker 1: as long as viruses don't come into human cells And I mean basically viruses that attack humans just break ourselves Right and just make them into like, you know, make a bunch of virus babies come out of them.

284
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,197
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like I use them the way the alien uses humans.

285
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:37,680
Speaker 1: basically Yeah But I you know at least that's actually preferable to say a virus going into human cells and replacing the nucleus with a virus.

286
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:45,549
Speaker 1: Turn I would turn into a giant mech suit for this virus My whole body I'll be much more terrifying.

287
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:53,489
Speaker 0: all I can think of also there are movies about that that old the Adventure Time short the muffin man where Bacteria in the end turned into a giant golem.

288
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,760
Speaker 0: and they're like we have a message from the tiny world.

289
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:58,820
Speaker 0: We can see you do number two.

290
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:06,499
Speaker 0: You are the number two All right in the better moment.

291
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:12,142
Speaker 0: As we've said many times geek nights is gonna sound weird for at least another two a month or so Probably.

292
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,406
Speaker 1: who knows how long?

293
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:18,240
Speaker 0: yep, cuz we are recording gig nights remotely via a discord and a bunch.

294
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,220
Speaker 1: Yes, when it's warm and biking season we could bike into the woods and record a geek night.

295
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,392
Speaker 0: Yep, or we could do a six feet of separation geek nights.

296
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:27,620
Speaker 1: We just stick with long-ass cables.

297
00:21:28,802 --> 00:21:29,526
Speaker 0: We'll figure stuff out.

298
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:30,692
Speaker 0: We'll improve this pipeline.

299
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:32,040
Speaker 1: Neither of us are sick.

300
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:44,050
Speaker 0: So I think if we both safely escape here and wash our hands and go to a place Record a thing together the key is one of us has someone in their household who's still exposed to the outside world and one of us does not.

301
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:50,578
Speaker 0: Mmm, that's that's the only limiting factor right now, but for the foreseeable future We're doing geek nights remotely Which means one?

302
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,520
Speaker 0: We might talk over each other a little more than usual or there might be occasional awkward pause.

303
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,349
Speaker 1: I could have worn them with that when the episode started.

304
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,791
Speaker 1: Also.

305
00:21:57,811 --> 00:21:59,539
Speaker 1: Do you notice how I just talked over you just now?

306
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:09,808
Speaker 0: - you might hear odd audio artifacts sometimes because I'm relying on a audio pipeline Scott put together on his own with Cheaper equipment than what I'm using here.

307
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:14,873
Speaker 0: It sounds pretty fine on our side, but I had one person complain But it was the person I expected to complain.

308
00:22:14,914 --> 00:22:15,800
Speaker 0: No one else has complained.

309
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:18,231
Speaker 0: It was Luke.

310
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:30,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course but this also means we're not doing the YouTube live streams yet because The pipeline we've got is already a little bit delicate And if I try to live stream is on YouTube.

311
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,715
Speaker 0: that introduces another variable.

312
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:44,360
Speaker 0: by next week I think we'll start streaming these on YouTube again, but Hold your horses one step at a time Mmm, otherwise the book club book is supposed to be the tale of Genji, but have you read any tale again?

313
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,094
Speaker 0: Uh, I'm currently reading the tale of Kaiji.

314
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:51,903
Speaker 1: Oh very close same country Same country.

315
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:56,980
Speaker 0: It's uh, I'm not reading a lot right now because you think oh, we're locked inside all day.

316
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,111
Speaker 1: We'll read but the video game season.

317
00:22:59,272 --> 00:22:59,513
Speaker 0: Yep.

318
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:00,840
Speaker 0: It is video game season.

319
00:23:01,101 --> 00:23:05,500
Speaker 1: It is can't play video can't look at that good screen when you're you know on the subway, right?

320
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:12,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, I am now in like six online Multiplayer civilization games like I actually surrendered in one.

321
00:23:12,355 --> 00:23:13,380
Speaker 1: So now I'm in one.

322
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:15,448
Speaker 0: You should join the one that does.

323
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:16,191
Speaker 0: culture just started.

324
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:17,114
Speaker 0: I guess it's too late.

325
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:17,656
Speaker 0: You missed it.

326
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:22,514
Speaker 0: good It's only four players on a tiny map and we're trying to only people who will take the turn.

327
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:29,428
Speaker 0: certain people were banned from this Game based on their performance in past games And also no one has been kicked out.

328
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:39,024
Speaker 0: So I think cloud play is now working fine in Civ 6 Which is a big step up from player damn turn for a lot of reasons Hmm.

329
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:40,780
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's pretty much video game season.

330
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:53,299
Speaker 0: The one thing I'll point out is that in lieu of maybe the book club and some other things for the short term Both Scott and myself are streaming a lot of games and playing a lot of the kind of stuff that we are not normally playing.

331
00:23:55,022 --> 00:23:56,916
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm getting around to stuff.

332
00:23:56,996 --> 00:24:02,220
Speaker 1: The thing is Every time I'm gonna go create something right which is like my plan.

333
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,320
Speaker 1: My plan is always make something which is of course a shit talk, right?

334
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,065
Speaker 1: I end up playing.

335
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:08,179
Speaker 0: I did do one of the things I said I do.

336
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:14,328
Speaker 0: You know My rule is if I say anything about it on this show during the moment Then I'm gonna force myself to do it no matter what.

337
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:26,479
Speaker 0: so despite the fact that there are no speakers in the computer room And there's almost no way to synchronize audio in a live stream for this purpose I live stream myself playing DDR for an hour and it totally worked.

338
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,806
Speaker 1: Okay, and fun with that.

339
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:30,132
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was actually really fun.

340
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:36,193
Speaker 0: It was weird because I've actually never seen video of myself playing DDR before like ever.

341
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,828
Speaker 0: Oh, I've seen you play a lot of yeah I've seen you play a lot of DDR.

342
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:41,979
Speaker 0: never seen myself play a lot of DDR.

343
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,928
Speaker 0: That was an interesting thing to watch especially with.

344
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:48,598
Speaker 0: like a crazy song like so deeper max 300 doesn't look great.

345
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:49,080
Speaker 1: Let me tell you

346
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:51,988
Speaker 0: Well, you can tell cuz I'm usually smart

347
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:53,514
Speaker 1: if it's not exactly I can't

348
00:24:53,615 --> 00:25:00,818
Speaker 0: like I'm smiling the whole time I'm just kind of dancing and kind of light on my feet But then in max 300 I am doing the opposite of smiling the whole time.

349
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:05,654
Speaker 0: I look Extremely concerned like I have this worried look on my face the whole time.

350
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:06,878
Speaker 1: That is correct.

351
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:09,207
Speaker 1: Yes That is an accurate description.

352
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:15,711
Speaker 0: Like if I have to be our face if I have to translate I basically I'm making a face that translates to oh shit.

353
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:16,012
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

354
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,293
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

355
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:16,575
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

356
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,338
Speaker 0: Oh shit the whole time.

357
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,030
Speaker 0: Pretty sure I look like that when I'm doing double black glade skiing as well.

358
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:25,449
Speaker 0: I'm also streaming the original xcom one.

359
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,633
Speaker 0: I'm just playing it through.

360
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:28,037
Speaker 0: no saves like.

361
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:28,860
Speaker 0: no safety saves.

362
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:29,662
Speaker 0: Just fucking good.

363
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:32,932
Speaker 0: if grenade comes into the sky Ranger into one mission.

364
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:33,714
Speaker 0: My whole team dies.

365
00:25:33,774 --> 00:25:34,597
Speaker 0: Well, that sucks.

366
00:25:34,657 --> 00:25:37,050
Speaker 0: Let's go Doing okay so far.

367
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,775
Speaker 0: I got two bases.

368
00:25:37,795 --> 00:25:41,607
Speaker 0: I I Got a bunch of alien technology.

369
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,495
Speaker 0: I've actually captured an alien like.

370
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:44,339
Speaker 0: I'm doing well so far.

371
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:57,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not uh, you know doing some big-time streaming, but if people are out there Discord has a super super super easy feature that lets you stream it within the discord voice channel.

372
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:01,020
Speaker 1: It lets you stream one window of your computer.

373
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:06,480
Speaker 1: So it's so low effort compared to using OBS and doing a twitch or YouTube stream.

374
00:26:06,943 --> 00:26:09,240
Speaker 1: That like every time I play a video game on my computer.

375
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:15,183
Speaker 1: I'm like I can click one button and stream this and I click it and like three listeners come because they're on the Geek night.

376
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:19,080
Speaker 1: semi-official somewhat blessed geek nights discord server.

377
00:26:19,302 --> 00:26:26,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you should come to the discord server And if you see the little TV icon on the bottom right of the server, that means someone in there is streaming.

378
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:28,196
Speaker 1: I see other listeners streaming in there, too.

379
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:39,062
Speaker 1: So just hop on in and click on the appropriate voice channel and you can watch You know and and even talk to me unlike and if I was on Twitch you would have to chat and I would talk at You.

380
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,516
Speaker 1: yeah be weird, right?

381
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,900
Speaker 0: I feel like I should start streaming in there more because generally it's just OBS cuz I'm doing like a stream for everybody.

382
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,801
Speaker 0: But if it's like a low-effort stream where I'm not putting it like I'm just like in a stream, whatever I should go in there Right.

383
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:50,962
Speaker 1: It's.

384
00:26:51,082 --> 00:26:51,745
Speaker 1: it's so low ever.

385
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:53,372
Speaker 1: It's not like to do the other OBS stream.

386
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,080
Speaker 1: I have to plan and set up right.

387
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:59,613
Speaker 1: Good Lord this it's like if I'm playing a game on my computer, I click the button.

388
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:00,957
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't I click the button?

389
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:01,880
Speaker 1: just grieving?

390
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,620
Speaker 0: DOSBox games that run full screen is via OBS is uh, I mean I did it like I didn't any problem doing it.

391
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,013
Speaker 0: But what a fucking nightmare it was to set that up, right?

392
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,740
Speaker 1: I'm telling you the discord is so easy.

393
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:16,522
Speaker 1: It's just like.

394
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:29,580
Speaker 0: it's also fun watching what my computer does cuz I can set my main 4k monitor to be 320 by 200 Resolution and my video card will totally do that and then it fucking does not know what to do with my other monitor.

395
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:39,670
Speaker 0: Yep, like my video card cannot reconcile having a 4k screen and a 320 by 240 Or whatever screen on at the same time.

396
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,076
Speaker 0: It's kind of funny to watch it struggle.

397
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,773
Speaker 0: Yep So yeah, we'll get right into it.

398
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:44,500
Speaker 0: It's tech news roundup.

399
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,880
Speaker 0: We won't linger too deep on any of these but this is just stuff that was in the news.

400
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:50,766
Speaker 0: We may have a lot to say we may not.

401
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:53,275
Speaker 0: it's just a pure list of nonsense.

402
00:27:53,335 --> 00:27:57,268
Speaker 0: and we'll start with the least Interesting news because it was the first one on the list.

403
00:27:57,729 --> 00:27:59,455
Speaker 1: At least you already preempted my.

404
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:00,559
Speaker 1: this is stupid news.

405
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:00,920
Speaker 1: who cares?

406
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:03,220
Speaker 0: This is why we don't think it's very uninteresting.

407
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:07,916
Speaker 0: This is why we often don't talk about raw tech news because very rarely do you care when like what.

408
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:13,479
Speaker 0: remember how excited I was When DRBD was added to the Linux kernel and how literally none of you gave a fuck about it.

409
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:18,820
Speaker 0: Well, yeah chromium edge is getting vertical tabs and a bunch of other features.

410
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:23,780
Speaker 0: I don't know who wants or likes vertical tabs.

411
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:26,715
Speaker 1: I also don't know who uses chromium edge.

412
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:27,680
Speaker 1: just use chrome.

413
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:29,680
Speaker 0: What's funny is in the enterprise world?

414
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,915
Speaker 0: People are still using Internet Explorer because their enterprises have not authorized the use of use of eggs.

415
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:36,460
Speaker 1: They're not even using regular edge.

416
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:40,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're using like the last Internet Explorer.

417
00:28:40,688 --> 00:28:40,748
Speaker 1: Yes.

418
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:54,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's amazing And I see bug tickets of people wanting that to be supported because in this day and age there are still banks that will not let anyone in their entire organization use a bread browser other than like IE9 or some shit.

419
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:54,990
Speaker 0: It's amazing.

420
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:58,860
Speaker 1: I don't even know what I use the last one But yeah, there hasn't been an IE in a long time.

421
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, I even then edge and I think edge is now dead to chromium edge, which is basically just Microsoft's version of Chrome.

422
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's literally Chrome at this point.

423
00:29:06,325 --> 00:29:09,695
Speaker 0: I use Chrome and Firefox kind of even Microsoft.

424
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:11,219
Speaker 1: stop using Internet Explorer, right?

425
00:29:13,805 --> 00:29:17,733
Speaker 0: In some other news Whatever I mean you can hear enough about the virus like.

426
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:18,940
Speaker 0: we're not gonna talk about coronavirus.

427
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:33,420
Speaker 0: But there is there are people who are not just me and Scott and like Lawrence Lessig and nerds who care about this stuff Talking about a really important topic now the idea that we should treat broadband and the internet like a public utility.

428
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:35,857
Speaker 1: Like yeah, I mean that is a mainstream idea.

429
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:38,087
Speaker 1: now Yeah, I mean this is all these things.

430
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:41,900
Speaker 1: are you know obvious ideas that we've said for a long time, right?

431
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:52,513
Speaker 1: It's like when they made electricity and telephone into a utility in the US They said right you have to provide it to every single person in the country Even if they live in the sticks, you have to provide a certain level of service.

432
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:54,903
Speaker 1: Every phone call must get through Right.

433
00:29:55,265 --> 00:29:56,349
Speaker 1: They said all these things.

434
00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:01,693
Speaker 1: but meanwhile at the internet you've got people in the middle of nowhere You know who have no internet or have internet.

435
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:03,020
Speaker 1: that's too slow to do anything.

436
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:08,260
Speaker 1: And now they're stuck at home and they can't internet and it's that's a big problem.

437
00:30:09,804 --> 00:30:14,719
Speaker 0: If they had no electricity schools are shut down so schools are supposed to try and do online remote learning.

438
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:15,724
Speaker 0: fine That's great.

439
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:18,120
Speaker 1: But I went at the school system has internet at home.

440
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,011
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people don't have internet.

441
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,680
Speaker 1: school itself barely has internet.

442
00:30:22,246 --> 00:30:23,359
Speaker 0: So none of that works.

443
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:25,388
Speaker 0: But everyone has electricity.

444
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:28,480
Speaker 0: most people have electricity at home and the people who don't have electricity?

445
00:30:28,581 --> 00:30:30,179
Speaker 0: There are government programs to help them out.

446
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:35,740
Speaker 0: There are not a lot of good government programs to get everybody access to actual modern internet.

447
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:36,525
Speaker 0: It has to be fast.

448
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:44,894
Speaker 1: the FCC's efforts to convince Telecos to spread their internet to rural areas have been weak and subpar,

449
00:30:45,135 --> 00:31:01,527
Speaker 0: but I think the virus now shows unequivocally that broadband high-speed internet access is as necessary as electricity and water and sewer systems in the modern era in a place like America and we really need to Treat it like a utility.

450
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,922
Speaker 0: I'm fine with there being private companies offering these services But there are.

451
00:31:04,942 --> 00:31:08,700
Speaker 0: there has to be a like the post office if they're offering upgraded services, right?

452
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,407
Speaker 1: The thing is, you know telephone.

453
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:12,155
Speaker 1: there were only so many upgraded services.

454
00:31:12,195 --> 00:31:13,260
Speaker 1: You could really get yep.

455
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,525
Speaker 1: It's like you make you make calls.

456
00:31:14,565 --> 00:31:14,987
Speaker 1: What can you do?

457
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:16,473
Speaker 1: better audio quality electricity?

458
00:31:16,513 --> 00:31:16,915
Speaker 1: What can you do?

459
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:17,959
Speaker 1: more electricity, right?

460
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,310
Speaker 0: I feel like there's two ways to go either with internet.

461
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,400
Speaker 1: You can definitely have upgraded services.

462
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,311
Speaker 1: They can give you static IP addresses.

463
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:27,322
Speaker 1: They can give you more Redundancies.

464
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:29,652
Speaker 1: they can give you more bandwidth.

465
00:31:29,692 --> 00:31:31,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, you lower latency.

466
00:31:31,117 --> 00:31:31,760
Speaker 0: I feel like the way.

467
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:35,532
Speaker 0: Well, the ideal future would be other.

468
00:31:35,572 --> 00:31:47,589
Speaker 0: we first we regulate the telcos much more heavily But beyond that we take the post office and we make them the government ISP and their mandate is they have to offer broadband Everywhere in the country and maybe you designate any.

469
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:58,280
Speaker 0: any place that has that can receive mail should be able to receive internet Yep, and maybe there are like special exceptions for extremely remote and isolated places with alternative service or whatever.

470
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:00,380
Speaker 0: But I don't care they've got to figure it out.

471
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,520
Speaker 0: That should be a public utility.

472
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:07,915
Speaker 0: That feels like something the post office should be in charge of yeah, but also just in general.

473
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:16,468
Speaker 1: I think the corona virus proves I mean it didn't need proving to us, but it gets needed proving to some other people that a lot of things Should be public utilities.

474
00:32:16,528 --> 00:32:16,749
Speaker 1: Yep.

475
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:23,255
Speaker 0: I or I mean that aren't and you know What shouldn't be a public utility the cruise companies because they're not even registered in the u.s.

476
00:32:23,295 --> 00:32:25,082
Speaker 0: We just let them all go bankrupt Fuck them.

477
00:32:25,162 --> 00:32:30,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically, you know, it's like all the things, you know, even things you wouldn't think about right?

478
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:39,310
Speaker 1: That are things that we complain about that are problematic or bad or wrong or whatever As soon as there's any pressure on society in general.

479
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,875
Speaker 1: those things are like exposed.

480
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:42,078
Speaker 0: Yeah exposed.

481
00:32:42,118 --> 00:32:45,800
Speaker 1: It's like hard It's like you ever see like this is kind of gross.

482
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,568
Speaker 1: But I learned this somewhat recently maybe months ago.

483
00:32:48,588 --> 00:32:54,806
Speaker 1: that like if you have scar tissue and then like you sort of you know Fall into poor health like your body.

484
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:55,187
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

485
00:32:55,228 --> 00:32:55,448
Speaker 0: See me.

486
00:32:55,468 --> 00:32:55,729
Speaker 0: That's it.

487
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:59,080
Speaker 0: That's one of the primary symptoms of advanced scurvy, right?

488
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:08,420
Speaker 1: It's like your body is maintaining the scar tissue to keep your skin closed And if you somehow don't have enough nutrients or whatever the scars will just open up again.

489
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:18,554
Speaker 0: If you're very yeah If you read the prince of nothing in that second book of the first trilogy where there's like the dark magic and in the evil Plane like old wounds were reopening that wasn't magic.

490
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:21,502
Speaker 0: That was just scurvy Right.

491
00:33:21,923 --> 00:33:24,611
Speaker 1: So it's the same kind of thing as for societies.

492
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:34,820
Speaker 1: when society has scurvy all these wounds It's like oh, you've got these shitty inefficiencies here We've got this corruption there and we're papering over it right with you know, our bullshit.

493
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:38,576
Speaker 1: Well like case in point sure injustice and then it's now this pressure.

494
00:33:38,656 --> 00:33:40,296
Speaker 1: So all the bullshits gone It's like ah fuck

495
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:55,957
Speaker 0: Well, like look in a world where we don't need as many brick-and-mortar stores because we can order stuff online Which is what most people want like sure but we built that system in such a broken manner that the delivery workers Can't actually do their job during a crisis like this and are being exploited miserably.

496
00:33:55,977 --> 00:34:08,360
Speaker 0: So Amazon and instacart which leaves my next news the workers are striking this week because they're not being protected They're being paid garbage and all of society relies on them now because he can't go to a brick-and-mortar store.

497
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:13,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I had never used instacart because that was always seemed like an evil uber ish business to me.

498
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, and even Amazon is also an evil business and I use him because I have to right.

499
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,060
Speaker 1: It's that comic with the peasant where he's like you also participate.

500
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:24,293
Speaker 1: Society you participate.

501
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:24,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's me.

502
00:34:26,141 --> 00:34:27,043
Speaker 1: But you know, I've been.

503
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:31,760
Speaker 1: I haven't been buying as you know much stuff and I'm definitely not buying anything now while there's a strike Go.

504
00:34:31,781 --> 00:34:43,940
Speaker 0: but in a healthier more functioning society the people working in these places one would be making a living wage And two in a crisis like this could basically be given hazard pay and protection to continue to do that job.

505
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:49,099
Speaker 1: You know, I want to make a comment about hazard pay right because way back in the day.

506
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:52,018
Speaker 1: Right hazard people don't remember this because it was so long ago.

507
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:57,620
Speaker 1: Hazard pay was a thing and the deal with hazard pay was you got a job underwater welder.

508
00:34:57,781 --> 00:35:00,820
Speaker 1: It's so dangerous oil rig worker oil rig workers.

509
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,272
Speaker 0: We're it like factory manager that we were gonna.

510
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:11,780
Speaker 1: we're gonna pay you extra money in order to Recompensate you for putting your life in danger, right and we eliminated hazard pay.

511
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:13,548
Speaker 1: Why did we eliminate hazard pay?

512
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:16,160
Speaker 1: because we eliminated hazard pay with OSHA?

513
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,120
Speaker 1: Which is the idea that no you shouldn't pay someone to put their life in danger.

514
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:23,339
Speaker 1: There should be a guarantee that your job must be safe.

515
00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:24,364
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are all.

516
00:35:24,384 --> 00:35:25,389
Speaker 0: there are exceptions for that.

517
00:35:25,409 --> 00:35:41,700
Speaker 1: for like for example, obviously in the military There are obvious exceptions, but the point is we labor fought for a long time Right to get to replace a lot of hazard pay with the idea that no, we'll just guarantee job safety.

518
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:56,740
Speaker 1: Yep, right and now that you know, we had this coronavirus thing going on There's a crisis or simply cannot be guaranteed even in reasonable circumstances Right, but there's been this reversion to like, you know fighting for hazard pay.

519
00:35:57,742 --> 00:36:01,440
Speaker 1: Well, I feel like you should be fighting for guaranteed workplace safe.

520
00:36:01,547 --> 00:36:09,920
Speaker 0: well I feel like there should be two things going on because there is a Fundamental issue of if these jobs paid a living wage and society wasn't stretched to its absolute limits.

521
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:18,487
Speaker 0: We can have a more reasonable conversation about maybe there is a temporary hazard pay during a crisis like that kind of thing Just saying, you know the don't don't think.

522
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:23,888
Speaker 1: I just want people to recognize because hazard pay hasn't been a topic of discussion in a long Time right?

523
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:33,260
Speaker 1: I don't want people to just want to be able to realize that hazard pay is not as good as Guaranteed workplace safety, which is what you really want.

524
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:41,429
Speaker 0: The hazard pay is supposed like the concept of it is supposed to be for jobs that cannot be made safer Like what the first one Scott mentioned underwater welding.

525
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,299
Speaker 0: all the OSHA requirements in the world can't make that job safe.

526
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:49,204
Speaker 1: They make it as to make it simple, right you make it as safe as possible But you still pay the first.

527
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:51,491
Speaker 1: don't want a situation where someone just accepts.

528
00:36:52,194 --> 00:36:54,060
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll play football with no helmet.

529
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:54,848
Speaker 1: How much paying me?

530
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:58,980
Speaker 0: All right, that's not except Look how hard it was to get hockey players to be forced to wear helmets.

531
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:01,190
Speaker 1: Right exactly and they didn't want to.

532
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,160
Speaker 0: they did not want to wear the helmets.

533
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,539
Speaker 0: Nobody forced them to and that one hazard pay.

534
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:08,807
Speaker 1: Hazard pay is a stopgap thing.

535
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,392
Speaker 1: It is not the goal, right?

536
00:37:10,632 --> 00:37:12,477
Speaker 0: It should be a safe workplace.

537
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:16,268
Speaker 0: hazard pay is for Exceptional crazy jobs like underwater are a lot of.

538
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:21,980
Speaker 1: I'm seeing a lot of stories though out there where people are not taking measures That could be taken to make workplaces safer.

539
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,855
Speaker 0: Yeah But also and like in an emergency where you can't make it safer like these delivery workers in the short term that hazard pay Can't just be like here's an extra ten dollars an hour.

540
00:37:30,936 --> 00:37:33,706
Speaker 0: It has to be like Life-changing money.

541
00:37:33,907 --> 00:37:34,892
Speaker 0: don't risk your life.

542
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:36,660
Speaker 1: It has to be adequate compensation.

543
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:42,297
Speaker 1: Right the amount of hazard you're going into you need to be you know, correctly and justifiably compensated.

544
00:37:42,438 --> 00:37:45,672
Speaker 1: if you know You just you're willing to do a dangerous job.

545
00:37:45,712 --> 00:37:46,817
Speaker 1: That can't be made safer.

546
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:49,628
Speaker 1: if you're willing I have to go into the reactor and clean it.

547
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:53,280
Speaker 1: Well, I've been given all protection available.

548
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:58,000
Speaker 1: I'm only going in for two minutes because we figured out that's how long it's safe to go in there, right?

549
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,344
Speaker 1: It's as safe as it can be.

550
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:02,052
Speaker 1: I'm still probably gonna get cancer or some shit.

551
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:05,786
Speaker 0: No life endangering work without life-altering pay that's the slogan.

552
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:21,220
Speaker 0: a little too hard to say that in the picket line, but Mm-hmm, so not sure if this will be tech news or not yet, but Sony and companies like it have a long history of Conglomerating and D conglomerating and having business lines and all these sorts of nonsense.

553
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:33,663
Speaker 1: I mean Sony the same company makes cameras right makes televisions Makes Walkman, I guess somewhere makes intellectual property and then complains that the Walkmans and televisions Used a pirate.

554
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:35,810
Speaker 0: that I've been like record companies.

555
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,900
Speaker 1: they have Playstations they video game they make so much crazy shit.

556
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,604
Speaker 1: That's unrelated or related.

557
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:46,299
Speaker 0: Yep, but Sony in particular has always had this dual duality of on one hand.

558
00:38:46,339 --> 00:39:16,097
Speaker 0: They made amazing technology for consumers in the space of media production and media consumption, but simultaneously they Make money from intellectual property that is directly threatened by that technology and they have never walked that line successfully ever no, so Currently it's all one big company with different divisions, but it looks like they're actually Splitting Sony electronics back into Sony electronics as a holding company.

559
00:39:16,498 --> 00:39:23,535
Speaker 1: So they're It's still all in the same big umbrella like Google alphabet or whatever, right?

560
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:25,120
Speaker 1: It's not actually a separate company.

561
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,840
Speaker 1: You can't buy stock in Sony electronics own but and it has its own CEO and its own board.

562
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:39,040
Speaker 1: well, but internally now it should have its own management structure and Reorg on the inside with you know, some tech shenanigans or something.

563
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:44,438
Speaker 0: But also theoretically it would be more independent of the other parallel holding companies.

564
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:47,955
Speaker 0: the question for Technologists will be we don't have a lot to say because we don't know.

565
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:48,920
Speaker 0: this is pretty early news.

566
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:58,200
Speaker 0: Will this in the future lead to Sony electronics not worrying about intellectual property problems?

567
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,083
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

568
00:39:59,123 --> 00:39:59,905
Speaker 1: That's not gonna happen.

569
00:39:59,945 --> 00:40:05,080
Speaker 0: or a potential split to not have this direct competition among itself.

570
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:10,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the question you could ask really is just is the management of it gonna be different?

571
00:40:10,386 --> 00:40:13,289
Speaker 1: Yeah That it's being under a different or in like.

572
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:14,292
Speaker 0: I want to know who.

573
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:21,580
Speaker 1: the president of Sony electronics is Probably the same person it was before but is it gonna change because they're in a different position on the org chart?

574
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:25,899
Speaker 1: Right, but the answer to that is probably not because a Japanese company they do how they do.

575
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:28,267
Speaker 0: Yep, I guess the interest is never the good.

576
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:34,597
Speaker 0: to see if there's a technological impact of this would simply be because Sony makes great Hardware if the rest of the company doesn't interfere with it.

577
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:40,560
Speaker 0: So anyway, will they bring someone interesting it from the outside in to head this thing up?

578
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,386
Speaker 0: It doesn't look like we have any details yet.

579
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:45,356
Speaker 1: I don't think this is really a significant news.

580
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:46,380
Speaker 1: It's just a business news.

581
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:47,249
Speaker 0: So here's a fun one.

582
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:48,139
Speaker 0: Here's a real tech news.

583
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:50,890
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of SSDs.

584
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,443
Speaker 0: you Hewlett-Packard enterprise SSDs as far as I can.

585
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:56,751
Speaker 1: so are these the SSDs that are s ATA?

586
00:40:56,891 --> 00:41:08,590
Speaker 1: or these the SSDs that are and you know M - these are says SSDs serially attached SCSI Solid so nothing anyone owns in their house.

587
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,031
Speaker 1: These are.

588
00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:10,356
Speaker 1: no one listening to this has.

589
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:11,640
Speaker 0: one of these are things you're putting in.

590
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,467
Speaker 0: You're like saying or whatever.

591
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:16,760
Speaker 1: someone might have one of these at their job if they're at a tech worker.

592
00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:24,728
Speaker 0: But the tech news is kind of amazing because I could foresee something like this happening on Consumer hardware as well because the possible.

593
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:28,960
Speaker 0: the problem is there's a firmware bug in these hard drives.

594
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:31,998
Speaker 0: Which for those of you who have hard drives at home?

595
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,537
Speaker 0: When was the last time you updated the firmware on your hard drives?

596
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:35,960
Speaker 0: It's there.

597
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:43,586
Speaker 1: You can go download updates like even for good CPU firmware updates and some of them come automatically with like Windows update But yeah, some of them don't.

598
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:52,546
Speaker 1: there's a lot of updates for things in your computer That you would only get if you went out and looked for them specifically and otherwise stuck with what your computer came with.

599
00:41:52,586 --> 00:41:52,666
Speaker 1: the

600
00:41:52,787 --> 00:42:18,180
Speaker 0: only people who care about firmware updates for like hard drives and shit are Nerds like us who want to make that last device in the Windows system manager show up with a real icon instead of just saying mystery device or because there's some specific thing we want to do with that technology or enterprise users who understand the danger of this crap, so Basically all these hard drives sometime in October will just brick themselves permanently

601
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,627
Speaker 1: Okay, and there's no way to unbrick them,

602
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:21,670
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

603
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:24,320
Speaker 0: unless and the data like the data cannot be recovered.

604
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,247
Speaker 0: It's just fucking dead to the world really.

605
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:29,940
Speaker 1: so even the chips the flash chips couldn't be like no taken off.

606
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,157
Speaker 0: You have got to update the firmware before this happens to you.

607
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:48,040
Speaker 0: you have 40,000 hours of runtime before it happens, okay, uh I. Well, I'm gonna bookmark this to remember in October to check and see if there are any major outages that are tied to this.

608
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:49,967
Speaker 1: Uh-huh how many how many.

609
00:42:50,007 --> 00:42:54,724
Speaker 1: these hard drives could really be out there, and they're probably all in Nasus or so.

610
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:58,053
Speaker 0: yeah, but it's probably Nasus or sans probably sans.

611
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:00,420
Speaker 0: that might be driving virtualized infrastructure.

612
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:15,660
Speaker 0: I feel like a lot of the system administrators of application servers are Not actually working with the hardware itself and based on other things I've seen in the industry people who are managing the hardware itself are increasingly less capable because there's not as many jobs in that space.

613
00:43:16,122 --> 00:43:18,131
Speaker 1: Well the major cloud providers aren't less capable.

614
00:43:18,151 --> 00:43:21,518
Speaker 1: they're more capable because all the smart people are there yep But other places not so much.

615
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:28,919
Speaker 1: But I think that a lot of those places from what I've heard the storage at those large cloud providers is like constantly cycled.

616
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:35,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's very unlikely that a drive would maybe even last that long to get to this point and in one of those places.

617
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:49,620
Speaker 1: Also, I think a lot of those the places that are super smart right are Mixing up their hard drive brands and models leaving me like this the net the giant NAS with five drives in it.

618
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,232
Speaker 0: I got up there.

619
00:43:51,302 --> 00:43:53,548
Speaker 0: Three of the drives are the same serial number at the same time.

620
00:43:53,588 --> 00:44:05,420
Speaker 1: the other two are same capacity drives same manufacturer different line Yep, and it's like that's just a general sort of good idea if you're serious business with storage is mix up the drives.

621
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:06,126
Speaker 1: Right you can't.

622
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,682
Speaker 1: you can't mix up your CPUs You've only got one.

623
00:44:08,702 --> 00:44:14,184
Speaker 1: you can't mix up your RAM sticks because they need to match to get you know High speed?

624
00:44:14,445 --> 00:44:15,932
Speaker 1: yeah, you can't really mix up.

625
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:17,018
Speaker 1: you would give you could.

626
00:44:17,078 --> 00:44:22,100
Speaker 1: it's like yeah I would love to have a computer with two CPUs and one AMD and one Intel and if one fails the other one keeps.

627
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,332
Speaker 1: Amazing you can't do that right, but if you're in the cloud You know at a big place you can mix up the hard drives with different brands.

628
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:31,520
Speaker 1: you could get more multiple computers.

629
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:32,223
Speaker 1: So it's like okay.

630
00:44:32,243 --> 00:44:34,373
Speaker 1: Let's not all buy the same CPU in every computer.

631
00:44:34,413 --> 00:44:36,744
Speaker 1: this one has this can CPU this one Is that CPU?

632
00:44:36,764 --> 00:44:38,331
Speaker 1: we'll put these RAM sticks in this one.

633
00:44:38,432 --> 00:44:39,939
Speaker 1: these are different RAM sticks in the other one.

634
00:44:40,442 --> 00:44:43,080
Speaker 1: So if some computers fail and some don't then you're alright.

635
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, your storage has multiple different drives.

636
00:44:45,608 --> 00:44:46,972
Speaker 1: as some crash you replace them.

637
00:44:47,213 --> 00:44:49,400
Speaker 1: you see oh all and then you can notice patterns.

638
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:52,760
Speaker 1: If you have such scale it's like huh all the all these hard drive.

639
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,328
Speaker 1: You look at your crashed hard drive pile.

640
00:44:54,368 --> 00:44:59,400
Speaker 1: at the end of the day that you probably have every single day You keep tabs on which ones have higher rates of failure.

641
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:02,720
Speaker 1: You know which ones to order next time you go out to buy more drives.

642
00:45:03,682 --> 00:45:07,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, so so we'll lightning round through the rest of these because I think we've gone on long enough.

643
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,656
Speaker 0: But you know lighting down to the rest quick comments or whatever one.

644
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:16,275
Speaker 0: Apple is now going to by default block all third-party cookies in Safari.

645
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:18,080
Speaker 1: I've been doing this for years.

646
00:45:18,504 --> 00:45:24,417
Speaker 0: I've been doing it as a different except I've had to make exceptions for a lot of specific websites that just fail without a third.

647
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:25,100
Speaker 1: go to those websites.

648
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:26,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of the websites.

649
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:26,774
Speaker 0: I have to go to.

650
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:30,228
Speaker 1: Well, but I don't make third-party cookies on your website.

651
00:45:30,388 --> 00:45:47,899
Speaker 0: the fun thing is whenever Apple does something like this whenever Apple makes something That was previously optional like this a default in Safari Usually almost every website other than like old fuddy-duddy government websites that no one knows how to update Tend to have to just bite the bullet and accommodate that.

652
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:52,876
Speaker 0: Because once that's the default on Apple a lot of people don't even know how to turn that off.

653
00:45:53,157 --> 00:46:05,579
Speaker 1: and I mean forget People forget, you know I talked about in a recent thing of the day flash died because Apple killed it by saying no no flash an iPhone deal with it Yep up until then and then flash time then flash died.

654
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:09,319
Speaker 1: So this is one area where apps and now they do this third-party cookies will just die.

655
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:09,479
Speaker 1: now.

656
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:16,100
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz any website that won't work without a third-party cookie won't work for anyone on an Apple computer and there's no way in hell.

657
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,111
Speaker 1: They don't care if it won't work for anyone with an Apple computer.

658
00:46:19,412 --> 00:46:23,907
Speaker 1: It won't work for almost anyone using an iPhone iPhone iPad Right.

659
00:46:23,968 --> 00:46:25,580
Speaker 1: That is what's gonna make it work.

660
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:28,532
Speaker 1: If they just did it on OS X that people would be like whatever.

661
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:29,777
Speaker 1: my website doesn't work in Safari.

662
00:46:29,798 --> 00:46:30,300
Speaker 1: who gives a shit?

663
00:46:30,461 --> 00:46:32,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one on OS X even using Safari.

664
00:46:32,936 --> 00:46:37,925
Speaker 1: Yeah So people on iPhone and iOS They're definitely using Safari.

665
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,372
Speaker 0: This is a technology adjacent news.

666
00:46:40,432 --> 00:46:51,020
Speaker 0: It's a very recent Supreme Court ruling but It has a weird implication Even though this is something that I guess we all should have known based on our knowledge of like constitutional law.

667
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:54,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I still though I have to rim just told me about this before the show.

668
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,860
Speaker 1: I didn't hear about it before so I don't know all these details.

669
00:46:58,424 --> 00:47:00,785
Speaker 1: So maybe some lawyer should chime in which we are not Yep.

670
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:08,500
Speaker 0: But basically there's a concept in American law that says you can't sue the federal government unless the federal government consents to being sued.

671
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:09,370
Speaker 1: Right.

672
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,240
Speaker 1: It's pretty straightforward.

673
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:18,319
Speaker 1: It's like if I want to sue rim Right, I go to the government and I file the right paperwork and whatever at the courthouse and then somebody will serve rim.

674
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,947
Speaker 1: He'll get served right and he'll have to.

675
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:26,345
Speaker 1: he'll be get notified that I'm suing his ass, right rim can't say no I don't want you to sue me.

676
00:47:26,989 --> 00:47:32,471
Speaker 1: But if you want to sue the government, I'll be like, hey government You fucked me over federal government, right?

677
00:47:32,712 --> 00:47:33,595
Speaker 1: I want to sue you.

678
00:47:34,057 --> 00:47:34,840
Speaker 1: the United States.

679
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,650
Speaker 1: You ever see those cases in the Supreme Court?

680
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,400
Speaker 1: was a United States verse so-and-so?

681
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,584
Speaker 1: yeah, all of those cases are.

682
00:47:40,664 --> 00:47:47,790
Speaker 1: most of them are because somebody committed a federal crime and Federal government is prosecuting them with criminal case.

683
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:55,699
Speaker 1: but they're also times where it's United States versus so-and-so because so-and-so Sued the federal government and said that's wrong.

684
00:47:55,779 --> 00:47:56,782
Speaker 1: You have to not do that.

685
00:47:56,882 --> 00:48:01,915
Speaker 1: Whatever you're doing is bad and hurting me, right and The federal government said okay.

686
00:48:02,517 --> 00:48:03,581
Speaker 1: We'll let you sue us.

687
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:04,423
Speaker 1: Let's go to court.

688
00:48:04,745 --> 00:48:06,410
Speaker 1: They could have just said, you know what?

689
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:09,141
Speaker 1: Okay, it doesn't matter if we're doing wrong to you.

690
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:12,634
Speaker 1: We don't want you to sue us too bad We're not going to court.

691
00:48:12,754 --> 00:48:13,978
Speaker 1: doesn't matter what face you file.

692
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,330
Speaker 0: this applies to the individual states as well.

693
00:48:17,391 --> 00:48:19,292
Speaker 0: I'm not super clear on all the detail I didn't.

694
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:25,836
Speaker 0: that is new information to Scott if that is true There are a lot of things that sort of trickle down to the states But this is one.

695
00:48:25,956 --> 00:48:29,136
Speaker 1: as far as I was aware if you sued the state of New York They could.

696
00:48:29,216 --> 00:48:30,629
Speaker 1: I didn't know if they could say no or not.

697
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:35,588
Speaker 1: so they but I I previously would figure that that would depend on the New York State Constitution as best I can tell.

698
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:39,019
Speaker 0: they can say no and Basically where this is going.

699
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:51,170
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna try to summarize this whole thing But the Supreme Court case is about a photographer and videographer who spent like a decade Getting all this footage and photographs of the wreck of the Queen Anne's Revenge in North Carolina.

700
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:53,974
Speaker 1: Okay Duncan ship pretty cool.

701
00:48:54,114 --> 00:48:58,850
Speaker 0: the state of North Carolina just took all a bunch of his stuff and started publishing it on their own.

702
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:01,122
Speaker 1: Were they using it for like their tourism promotion stuff?

703
00:49:01,223 --> 00:49:02,450
Speaker 0: I don't even know what they were using it for.

704
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,920
Speaker 1: They did it for something they use it for.

705
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:05,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know but they published it.

706
00:49:05,731 --> 00:49:07,500
Speaker 0: So we sued them saying hey, this is my footage.

707
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:08,325
Speaker 0: You can't just use it.

708
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:09,370
Speaker 1: That's right.

709
00:49:09,451 --> 00:49:11,609
Speaker 1: If you're a photographer you take photos, that's your work.

710
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:14,590
Speaker 1: I asked you a ton of money to in time to make those photos.

711
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:23,652
Speaker 0: so when you sue the state without the state's Permission and there's a whole court case that went all the way up to Supreme Court about that and the Supreme Court came down Hard.

712
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:25,260
Speaker 1: the actual Supreme Court.

713
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:34,457
Speaker 0: Yep, Supreme Court of the United States Allen at all v. Cooper governor of North Carolina at all Alright, so what were the what?

714
00:49:34,477 --> 00:49:35,220
Speaker 1: it was all just.

715
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,003
Speaker 1: it was a unanimous.

716
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:37,188
Speaker 0: It was decided on March 23rd.

717
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,102
Speaker 0: I don't know the unanimity or any of that yet.

718
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:41,810
Speaker 1: Well, I just said they came down hard.

719
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:47,985
Speaker 0: They didn't come down hard if it was five four I'm just reading the syllabus right now, but they came down hard in terms of the language.

720
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:57,470
Speaker 0: They basically like In general a federal court may not cure a suit brought by any person against a non-consenting state period.

721
00:49:58,212 --> 00:50:07,058
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, okay, but there's this whole thing where states can be sued directly if there's unequivocal Statutory language from Congress.

722
00:50:07,118 --> 00:50:16,023
Speaker 0: basically like if there's a law that regulates something in a particular way like copyright law then like There's an exception to that rule.

723
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:17,050
Speaker 0: that I don't really understand.

724
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:21,723
Speaker 0: But basically the decision in this case seems to say that that does not apply.

725
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:28,376
Speaker 0: all the ways that have been argued To allow states to be sued for copyright don't fly at all.

726
00:50:28,497 --> 00:50:32,142
Speaker 0: and This is not apparently new.

727
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:32,705
Speaker 0: new like.

728
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:35,516
Speaker 0: it's not a new President it's just a no.

729
00:50:35,556 --> 00:50:44,930
Speaker 0: this president has never been applied in this manner in the realm of copyright in the sense that very few Copyright decisions or questions have actually been addressed by the Supreme Court.

730
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:47,266
Speaker 0: A lot of copyright law is never is still untested.

731
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:47,770
Speaker 0: like you

732
00:50:48,271 --> 00:51:04,898
Speaker 1: This is as you say it is and there isn't some sort of thing that means that any state or the federal government Could commit blatant copyright infringement and that nobody could sue them for it Which means you couldn't stop them because copyright is a civil matter It's not a criminal matter

733
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:05,179
Speaker 0: yup,

734
00:51:05,702 --> 00:51:16,184
Speaker 1: which means that for example If this is true as we understand it probably wrongly very wrongly The New York State as it is could create a Netflix.

735
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:28,350
Speaker 1: that is the New York State Netflix Provide it to all New York State residents, and it has every movie ever in it for free Including ones that are in the theater right now that were pirated with like a cam a shaky cam.

736
00:51:28,731 --> 00:51:30,458
Speaker 0: Yep, that seems to be the case.

737
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:34,614
Speaker 0: I found a better summary cool even things from other countries And just every.

738
00:51:34,935 --> 00:51:39,050
Speaker 1: you know the whole Library of Congress could just put every single thing in their entire archive up online for free.

739
00:51:39,351 --> 00:51:39,934
Speaker 1: So the whole world.

740
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:50,270
Speaker 0: in essence the Supreme Court agreed with the Fourth Circuit Striking down the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990 this 30 year old amendment god that was 30 years ago.

741
00:51:50,693 --> 00:51:52,969
Speaker 0: I've heard of the CRCA, but I didn't know what it did.

742
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:58,890
Speaker 0: I never heard of it because it read CRCA like CBD tPA and all those other things that I'd be vaguely pissed about.

743
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,161
Speaker 1: I heard I heard a CBD tPA, but that didn't go.

744
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:15,050
Speaker 0: so the 30 year old amendment to the Copyright Act of 1976 so in the night covered over 1976 was admitted in 1990 and It stripped states of their sovereign immunity where copyright was concerned.

745
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:27,410
Speaker 0: Aha, so that was settled until just now when the court the Supreme Court basically said yeah The CRCA fuck that states can do whatever the fuck they want fuck you.

746
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:35,965
Speaker 1: So there was also Congress passed a law that said states are not immune To copyright infringement suits, and then the Supreme Court said yes, they are.

747
00:52:36,106 --> 00:52:37,050
Speaker 0: that seems to be the case.

748
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:43,210
Speaker 0: I'm sure a lawyer will correct some fiddly details there, but this opens up the door to what I like to call a Scott plan.

749
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:49,025
Speaker 0: We the one I just said yeah, New York State Netflix during the coronavirus crisis.

750
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:50,510
Speaker 0: Let's go all right.

751
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,533
Speaker 1: well Here's what you need to do.

752
00:52:51,553 --> 00:53:00,122
Speaker 1: is you need to contact your state representatives your estate when you in New York We have assemblypersons, and we have senators right.

753
00:53:00,403 --> 00:53:00,684
Speaker 1: I don't know.

754
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:02,913
Speaker 1: you have in your state whatever state You're in.

755
00:53:02,954 --> 00:53:04,949
Speaker 1: yeah, you know you're a common legislator.

756
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:15,416
Speaker 1: Right contact your state legislators you have them I just don't know what they are and then tell them about this and say hey Because this is the thing you should do.

757
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:16,940
Speaker 1: this and you need to present.

758
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:24,143
Speaker 1: frame your argument in terms of this will be Good for the state and a good usage of the state's money.

759
00:53:24,685 --> 00:53:25,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how you need to frame it.

760
00:53:27,073 --> 00:53:29,050
Speaker 1: So well not just I want free movies.

761
00:53:29,612 --> 00:53:36,919
Speaker 0: I'm really curious to see what comes of this because this was news to me And I got to go back and actually read more about the CRC.

762
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:47,690
Speaker 1: does this mean that when Disney goes to the public school That's putting on The Lion King Play by the states that they cannot be sued?

763
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:52,890
Speaker 0: I see I have no idea like I barely understand how the federal stuff falls down to the states.

764
00:53:53,272 --> 00:54:06,783
Speaker 1: I have no idea how this that's a real thing that happens all the fucking time Because I guess mean that a school can put on a showing of a movie that just came out in there in their Auditorium and charged for tickets.

765
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:10,439
Speaker 0: not a private school But what about a public school public score?

766
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:12,566
Speaker 0: what about a public library?

767
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:13,690
Speaker 0: That's run by the state.

768
00:54:14,432 --> 00:54:15,415
Speaker 1: Well library is already do?

769
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:19,810
Speaker 0: they who libraries can't are having a lot of trouble with digital works these days.

770
00:54:20,392 --> 00:54:21,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is interesting.

771
00:54:21,697 --> 00:54:22,701
Speaker 0: Yeah, also.

772
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:23,404
Speaker 0: This isn't digital.

773
00:54:23,444 --> 00:54:26,033
Speaker 0: This is anything the library Does this mean?

774
00:54:26,053 --> 00:54:27,096
Speaker 1: now he hold on.

775
00:54:27,718 --> 00:54:31,730
Speaker 1: does this mean that New York State could right?

776
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:34,259
Speaker 1: So we're just talking about like screening movies here right?

777
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:35,424
Speaker 1: no no no let's go.

778
00:54:35,464 --> 00:54:36,207
Speaker 1: Let's go harder.

779
00:54:36,447 --> 00:54:37,090
Speaker 1: Let's go harder.

780
00:54:38,514 --> 00:54:42,348
Speaker 1: the state hands out free copies of Microsoft Windows.

781
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,942
Speaker 0: Whoo that's just copyright right right?

782
00:54:46,043 --> 00:54:47,710
Speaker 1: the state just hands out copies.

783
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:52,126
Speaker 1: I guess it's a cloud thing now, but they just hand out Adobe Creative Cloud licenses.

784
00:54:52,146 --> 00:54:53,050
Speaker 1: I don't know now licenses.

785
00:54:53,612 --> 00:54:54,195
Speaker 0: That's where they get you.

786
00:54:54,235 --> 00:55:00,982
Speaker 1: I just say I'm just saying like you know could you just hand out Copyrighted things like hey the state is just printing DVD.

787
00:55:01,022 --> 00:55:04,533
Speaker 1: I just need a copy of cool edit 2000.

788
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:06,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, just like you know Whatever.

789
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:12,070
Speaker 0: yeah, so I'm gonna read and learn more about this, and I'm sure the listener will tell us where we were wrong there.

790
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:21,064
Speaker 0: But who knows all right, and then briefly just going through the last little bit There's a story about how 5g uses more energy than 40 common sense.

791
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:26,082
Speaker 1: currently it uses a lot more though like It's a lot faster, and it's a lot more reliable.

792
00:55:26,202 --> 00:55:27,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, how do you think you're getting that for free?

793
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:34,585
Speaker 0: No, so I think the last thing we're going to talk about is everyone has to video conference and work from home now in the US and around the world.

794
00:55:34,606 --> 00:55:55,348
Speaker 0: yep, and There's definitely a divide between People who have a company that knows what they're doing that has some enterprise solution people who are at least tech savvy enough to know like The ways to share Presentations and video in a safe manner and then everybody else who's using zoom for some fucking reason don't use zoom.

795
00:55:55,609 --> 00:55:57,898
Speaker 0: good guy Why is everyone using zoom?

796
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:59,124
Speaker 0: I never heard of zoom.

797
00:55:59,144 --> 00:56:01,874
Speaker 1: I never heard of zoom But apparently it's just.

798
00:56:01,934 --> 00:56:09,977
Speaker 1: you know people don't have access or don't have easy ways to video conference except FaceTime Which is people don't remember this.

799
00:56:10,017 --> 00:56:16,722
Speaker 1: when FaceTime came out Apple said we're gonna make iMessage and FaceTime Open so that anyone can build on that platform.

800
00:56:16,762 --> 00:56:18,590
Speaker 1: that never fucking happened right?

801
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:24,894
Speaker 1: I want to go find in the keynote where they announced FaceTime and cut that part out and be like hey if you did that That would have been pretty good.

802
00:56:24,934 --> 00:56:28,229
Speaker 1: right now right because FaceTime is actually the best technologically speaking.

803
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:31,142
Speaker 1: Just only people with iPhones can use it.

804
00:56:31,182 --> 00:56:31,524
Speaker 1: I guess.

805
00:56:31,685 --> 00:56:32,810
Speaker 1: or Apple devices.

806
00:56:34,073 --> 00:56:37,838
Speaker 1: So everyone else is like okay What are we gonna use right to do a video conference?

807
00:56:37,919 --> 00:56:41,090
Speaker 1: the choices that are available are actually?

808
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:46,145
Speaker 1: Surprisingly few that meet the use cases of normal people.

809
00:56:46,205 --> 00:56:46,987
Speaker 1: right Google Hangout?

810
00:56:47,047 --> 00:56:49,533
Speaker 1: who has a Google Hangout setup?

811
00:56:49,594 --> 00:56:51,339
Speaker 1: you'd have to have like an actual.

812
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,722
Speaker 1: you know Google meet.

813
00:56:52,983 --> 00:56:55,290
Speaker 1: your company has to be using g-suite for that to work.

814
00:56:55,511 --> 00:57:00,082
Speaker 0: Discord works really well But you have to set it up and then get everyone else to like make a discord.

815
00:57:00,122 --> 00:57:03,033
Speaker 1: discord doesn't do a video chat between Everybody.

816
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,359
Speaker 1: it's just an audio chat.

817
00:57:04,479 --> 00:57:06,990
Speaker 0: It's an audio chat and or a screen share, right?

818
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:10,050
Speaker 1: So if you want to do a screen share from one person in the chat

819
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:10,311
Speaker 0: Yeah,

820
00:57:10,773 --> 00:57:19,965
Speaker 1: if you want to do a video chat where you can see everyone in the chat with a lot of people Right you can do an easy one-to-one with a lot of different solutions right?

821
00:57:20,707 --> 00:57:25,162
Speaker 1: most of the video Conferencing solutions are made for like you're in an office room.

822
00:57:25,202 --> 00:57:31,121
Speaker 1: the office room has a special thing set up And then someone else is the special thing or I have an app.

823
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:36,681
Speaker 1: the app connects to a system a proprietary system Doctor is using so I can chat with the doctor, right?

824
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:37,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, there aren't.

825
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:38,890
Speaker 1: what else is there?

826
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:50,406
Speaker 1: That's like a whole bunch of people video chat together all at once almost nothing except for a stupid garbage zoom Which is being used because nothing else does what it does easily.

827
00:57:50,446 --> 00:57:57,967
Speaker 0: that's available to everyone Yeah But also a lot of people are doing video chat where everyone's sharing video when that's not actually what they need.

828
00:57:58,027 --> 00:57:59,050
Speaker 0: the use case you described.

829
00:57:59,371 --> 00:58:05,373
Speaker 0: Yes, that's hard to do for most people and there is a need for that like trying to have your stand-up meetings with all your Engineers.

830
00:58:05,413 --> 00:58:08,230
Speaker 0: you got a team of 10 like yep 10. video chat is great.

831
00:58:08,391 --> 00:58:10,639
Speaker 0: I luckily where I work we have something that just works.

832
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:12,506
Speaker 0: global like it literally just works.

833
00:58:12,587 --> 00:58:27,030
Speaker 0: It's so good Yes, but like not everyone has that but a lot of people are doing that when what they actually need is just sharing one screen And one person talking while everyone else listens and then possibly answers questions or passing the baton to someone else, right?

834
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:32,910
Speaker 1: So if you are doing the one video screen thing and not the I need to see everyone's face.

835
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:33,775
Speaker 1: We're all together.

836
00:58:34,217 --> 00:58:38,019
Speaker 1: you can use discord like we just said because we're a nerd But you can also just use any.

837
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:39,930
Speaker 1: there's a variety of just search for webinar.

838
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:46,810
Speaker 1: There are several webinar systems out there any of which are pretty good easy to use and better than zoom.

839
00:58:47,272 --> 00:58:49,001
Speaker 1: I just used a webinar the other day.

840
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:54,283
Speaker 1: my company had like at the global Company meeting right and so the way it worked is.

841
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:59,062
Speaker 1: there were five company executives You could see and you could see some slides they were showing.

842
00:58:59,545 --> 00:59:00,650
Speaker 1: you couldn't see anyone else.

843
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:04,959
Speaker 1: Everyone else is just in the chat Yep and you could send global chat messages because they allowed it.

844
00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:09,181
Speaker 1: they didn't have to and you could also send messages direct to them that Only they would see.

845
00:59:09,242 --> 00:59:13,789
Speaker 1: to ask questions Yeah, and you could also ask questions in the company slack because company slack, right?

846
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:15,515
Speaker 0: But what's happening if it was?

847
00:59:15,596 --> 00:59:19,269
Speaker 1: imagine a zoom with all the almost 500 employees in the company?

848
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:22,009
Speaker 1: That wouldn't have been too great.

849
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:29,089
Speaker 0: So the things that are happening out there that are sad and hilarious and all over the place are one.

850
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:38,850
Speaker 0: a lot of people are trying to use all the software right now, but Don't read the documentation and lack a basic understanding of anything related to computers.

851
00:59:39,272 --> 00:59:48,024
Speaker 0: so shit's happening like the LA City Council was doing their meetings on zoom and People kept joining and playing porn and they didn't know how to stop that.

852
00:59:48,065 --> 00:59:49,129
Speaker 0: so they had to shut the whole thing down.

853
00:59:49,796 --> 00:59:52,493
Speaker 1: Yeah, they should use the webinar Yeah or on a zoom.

854
00:59:52,754 --> 00:59:54,960
Speaker 0: a school was doing meetings and people are.

855
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:56,605
Speaker 0: people are just searching around.

856
00:59:56,645 --> 01:00:01,642
Speaker 0: like a lot of these services will just Have URLs that you can access with no protection at all.

857
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:11,214
Speaker 1: Like only share the URL people keep I mean even you know, like the one little webinars I went to they were just URLs, but people and it's like reusing URLs they've already used.

858
01:00:11,495 --> 01:00:17,310
Speaker 0: and now hackers and trolls are just finding URLs that have been published anywhere and just streaming porn to them.

859
01:00:18,092 --> 01:00:24,369
Speaker 1: Right, it's you know, if you see your zoom URL gets, you know You send it say you're doing a webinar and you send the URL to all the viewers.

860
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:29,488
Speaker 1: Like I actually paid $20 for a webinar last week to learn some education.

861
01:00:29,508 --> 01:00:32,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It was pretty it was pretty good cheap worth it, right?

862
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:40,609
Speaker 1: from a highly skilled individual and then Friggin I could have sent that link that I paid $20 for to like a hundred people.

863
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:42,014
Speaker 1: Yeah we didn't I wouldn't have had to pay.

864
01:00:42,475 --> 01:01:01,182
Speaker 0: and also if you have a real use case like you're a city council or Like you run a company They're not pay for a real like enterprise to like buy something like they're not all great but like webex or go to meeting like there's services that just do this kind of stuff and Maybe you should have thought of this at some point in the past.

865
01:01:01,202 --> 01:01:02,669
Speaker 0: Like what were you doing up to this point?

866
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:03,933
Speaker 1: They don't have.

867
01:01:03,973 --> 01:01:05,666
Speaker 1: there's not enough IT people to go around.

868
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:12,675
Speaker 0: Yeah But even worse most of the people using zoom seem to be using it for one-on-one conversations But you're the like.

869
01:01:12,776 --> 01:01:15,006
Speaker 0: there are a lot of ways to do that without zoom.

870
01:01:15,026 --> 01:01:17,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, right It's like I'm saying zoom is garbage.

871
01:01:18,396 --> 01:01:19,570
Speaker 1: Use it as little as possible.

872
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:26,953
Speaker 1: In fact zoom one of the only things that's available to anyone that does what I just said of having several people all talk Video at the same.

873
01:01:26,993 --> 01:01:35,570
Speaker 0: but I have noticed the people who seem to keep sending me zoom invites are the same people who always try To get me to use what's app with them instead of anything more modern or good, right?

874
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:39,418
Speaker 1: If you need to do one-on-one Then you can just use like Skype or something.

875
01:01:39,438 --> 01:01:40,863
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was actually not bad.

876
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:45,889
Speaker 1: or just on the Microsoft phone call You don't always need the video yeah, and if you both have.

877
01:01:46,532 --> 01:01:52,170
Speaker 1: Seriously, if everyone you're talking to before you do this check to make sure is there anyone you're talking to you as an Android device?

878
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:53,636
Speaker 1: If not, you just use FaceTime.

879
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:54,401
Speaker 1: It's the best.

880
01:01:54,442 --> 01:01:55,690
Speaker 0: the other thing people are like speaking.

881
01:01:55,871 --> 01:01:58,009
Speaker 0: I've had to explain this to a few people lately.

882
01:01:58,351 --> 01:02:10,146
Speaker 0: but most of these things that lets you video conference technically aren't allowed to be used by people under the age of 13 because of GDPR and or Child protect like child online copa stuff that is also technically creating.

883
01:02:10,407 --> 01:02:19,565
Speaker 0: if you're a school You can't use any of this shit and that's why a lot of schools started doing remote learning and then suddenly shut down Because they can't actually have kids under 13 use these things.

884
01:02:19,685 --> 01:02:20,830
Speaker 1: Yes, they need to make their own.

885
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,845
Speaker 1: They needs their separate school type systems the same way.

886
01:02:23,885 --> 01:02:24,569
Speaker 1: I just said talk.

887
01:02:24,609 --> 01:02:28,230
Speaker 0: Yes They're not willing to pay for that software.

888
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:33,990
Speaker 1: So the companies that make the soft schools won't have to pay for the software because they can't be sued for copyright.

889
01:02:34,192 --> 01:02:38,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, bring it full circle And I think we can stop there.

890
01:02:39,591 --> 01:02:42,361
Speaker 0: We'll continue to do the show remotely as long as we need to.
