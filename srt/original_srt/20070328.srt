1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,798
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday March 28th.

2
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:12,620
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,828
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek night.

4
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:19,050
Speaker 0: tonight We review the first volume of Keiko Takemiya's to Tara.

5
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:21,727
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:31,136
Speaker 0: So a while ago we decided to have a couple of contests here at geek night since we had a bunch of various free stuff to lay around and We thought it'd be fun.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,930
Speaker 0: and one of those contests Which is over is relevant to tonight.

8
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:40,190
Speaker 0: And I must say you guys really disappointed in terms of telling us about the worst anime ever.

9
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:41,053
Speaker 1: I don't know.

10
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:42,900
Speaker 1: are people just not paying attention to?

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,306
Speaker 1: people want contests.

12
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:45,450
Speaker 1: Do you not want contests?

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:53,970
Speaker 0: Well, we got a lot of entries But I'll be honest the entries were all pretty crap or didn't really follow the rules so much or didn't actually do what we asked.

14
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:55,675
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're you know.

15
00:00:55,695 --> 00:01:06,790
Speaker 1: while there were you know some entries there weren't a lot compared to how many people I know We're out there listening to this also compared to the Thursday night contest which got more quality entries than I know how to deal with.

16
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:09,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what the hell guys?

17
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:11,690
Speaker 1: maybe we just won't give out a prize because everyone lost.

18
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:18,329
Speaker 0: I just don't think anyone's actually seen that much bad anime Or if they have they don't obviously have the ability to write effectively about it.

19
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:25,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, when we say hey, we want you to write something and you just say yeah, this anime was pretty bad That does that's that?

20
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:28,335
Speaker 0: no I suppose I didn't want to have to say that.

21
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:29,719
Speaker 0: I guess grammar counts.

22
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:32,729
Speaker 0: some of them are just not readable and some of them it.

23
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:35,239
Speaker 1: It's like you didn't even write a paragraph.

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,488
Speaker 1: most of these things are less than two sentences.

25
00:01:37,628 --> 00:01:42,706
Speaker 1: now compare I was and if I was gonna enter this contest I would have written a multi paragraph essay.

26
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:53,710
Speaker 0: now compare They expected to Thursday night where not only we get a ton of entries for the worst podcast in the world contest But a few of the entries pushed the one or two page mark.

27
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:57,383
Speaker 0: They wrote diatribes about how bad these things were with examples.

28
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what you got to do people.

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,970
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get free stuff without doing some work here.

30
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we're gonna go through them, but if no one gave us a good entry We're not gonna give you the MD guy soundtrack.

31
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,870
Speaker 0: No well mail you something maybe but it's not gonna be MD guys.

32
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:13,426
Speaker 0: No, it's too good for you.

33
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,848
Speaker 1: Well, it's pretty bad.

34
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,293
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll be.

35
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:17,916
Speaker 1: I don't know.

36
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:21,630
Speaker 1: I didn't actually look at all the entries and with a lot of time and care.

37
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:26,005
Speaker 1: So maybe there is one in there, that's good enough, and we can give them the empty guys.

38
00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:28,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I don't know I gotta go look.

39
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:31,250
Speaker 0: so in the news you can't have ten years of Pokemon.

40
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,457
Speaker 1: Actually you have a lot more than ten years of Pokemon.

41
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:46,155
Speaker 0: well in April the TV show Pokemon that indoctrinated millions of young children around the world into the wonderful fantastic world of marketing is Gonna be ten years old.

42
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:47,360
Speaker 1: now think about that.

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,830
Speaker 1: the Pokemon TV show is ten years old.

44
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,231
Speaker 1: You know what.

45
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:56,090
Speaker 1: the Gameboy game is older, and the manga is older, so Pokemon is real old.

46
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:57,112
Speaker 0: Thing is though.

47
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:58,496
Speaker 0: They're not that much older.

48
00:02:58,557 --> 00:03:02,490
Speaker 0: It surprises me in one that Wow Pokemon came out a long time ago.

49
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:08,381
Speaker 0: I feel old, but then at the same time Wow Pokemon wasn't around nearly as long as I feel like it was.

50
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:18,290
Speaker 1: well see the thing is Pokemon came out in the mid to late 90s and it's the mid to late 2000. so all that stuff that came out around then is becoming a decade old and it's kind of scary.

51
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:30,310
Speaker 0: But when I was in when I first got to RIT I remember you know you think back when I was a freshman in college to When Pokemon was around or whatever and I couldn't imagine a time in my life where there was no Pokemon.

52
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,369
Speaker 0: I couldn't fathom the idea that there was once a time when I never heard of Pikachu.

53
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:40,066
Speaker 1: I Can because there was such a time when I was no one who is born from here on out.

54
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:43,880
Speaker 1: in Western society We'll be able to do so let alone Eastern society.

55
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:45,526
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe North Korea.

56
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:46,750
Speaker 0: They might not know about Pokemon.

57
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:53,010
Speaker 1: I mean, I just saw a picture yesterday of an airplane with Pokemon like paint job on it or a giant Pokemon decal.

58
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,833
Speaker 1: I couldn't tell which.

59
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:57,006
Speaker 1: well just the other day right on the plane you get Pokemon stuff.

60
00:03:57,307 --> 00:04:05,998
Speaker 0: just the other day We were playing Smash Brothers since it's the best game on the Wii right now And I used Pikachu like three times.

61
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:09,690
Speaker 1: yeah, cuz you like to use Pikachu because yes, he's super cheap.

62
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,586
Speaker 1: He is that lightning that comes down from the sky so no one can attack you from above.

63
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:16,677
Speaker 1: they can only attack you from the Against mediocre players.

64
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:19,927
Speaker 0: Pikachu is cheap and amazing against anyone knows what they're doing.

65
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:20,829
Speaker 0: Pikachu is kind of useless.

66
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:27,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, just the thing is if someone else is Pikachu you can't come at them from above because he'll drop the lightning on you.

67
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,182
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I'm playing against people who actually know what they're doing.

68
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,568
Speaker 0: I almost always use Falco.

69
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:33,376
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, you're not.

70
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:34,541
Speaker 1: we're not that good at that game.

71
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:36,149
Speaker 0: Anyway, most I'm better than you.

72
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,973
Speaker 1: No, you're not.

73
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:41,170
Speaker 1: most people who know what they're doing at the game kick both our asses though real hard.

74
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,617
Speaker 1: We don't even have a chance to do damage.

75
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:51,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, luckily whenever the new one comes out I imagine I'm gonna sit down and put actual effort into being the best there ever was or at least in the top million.

76
00:04:51,251 --> 00:05:02,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, and since I'm hoping that it uses more Wii type controls and less old-school fighting type controls I'll actually have a chance of because my old-school fighting type control skills are not so high.

77
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:09,610
Speaker 1: so if it's all about Wii controls I can definitely get ahead and Maybe be the best there is at Smash Brothers brawl.

78
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:12,784
Speaker 0: So there's really nothing else I can say about Pokemon.

79
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:15,602
Speaker 0: being 10 years old I could make it you can't something.

80
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:24,818
Speaker 1: 10 Pokemon joke but I already did and it's kind of lost his position as Pokemon came out when I was like in high school and High school 10 years ago.

81
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:27,830
Speaker 0: God damn don't think about it because then you're gonna remember.

82
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,997
Speaker 0: I mean remember that stupid sci-fi thing.

83
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,302
Speaker 0: I was watching wild palms.

84
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:34,172
Speaker 0: I saw that when I was like 11.

85
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:42,138
Speaker 1: So, you know Makoto Shinkai the guy who did plays promised and voices of a distant star and Some other stuff that we never saw.

86
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,467
Speaker 1: but now I realize it exists and I kind of want to see it.

87
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:47,418
Speaker 0: of things He is done that I have seen he's batting a thousand.

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's made basically two things that I've seen.

89
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:53,708
Speaker 1: They've both been basically the same only different.

90
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:57,763
Speaker 0: Yep We both disagree a little bit as to which one is better, but I agree.

91
00:05:57,884 --> 00:05:59,510
Speaker 0: I would agree that they're both very good.

92
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,461
Speaker 0: I really liked place promised and I really like toshino car.

93
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:06,792
Speaker 1: Well, his new thing is called Biyoko's.

94
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:08,202
Speaker 1: no be also crew.

95
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:10,973
Speaker 0: five centimeter Five centimeter.

96
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,619
Speaker 1: that's called five centimeters per second.

97
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,850
Speaker 1: people aren't quite sure but it might be called five centimeters per second.

98
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:18,573
Speaker 1: Okay show.

99
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:32,890
Speaker 0: All right now considering that I've seen two different works by this guy I'm gonna hazard a guess that this somehow involves a boy and a girl who like each other in some way and then are Separated and are either trying to come back together or cannot come back together.

100
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically that's what it is he's.

101
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,530
Speaker 1: it's a three-part movie.

102
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:45,799
Speaker 1: I guess I don't know if you'd call it an OAV, but it's like three separate 30-minute things that go together and You can get part one on the bit.

103
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,093
Speaker 1: Torrance right now with the fansubs Uh-huh.

104
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,650
Speaker 0: It seems like this guy might be a one-trick pony, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

105
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:54,534
Speaker 1: No, it's it's not.

106
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:56,242
Speaker 1: it's sort of like the guy who does snatch.

107
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:57,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's Madonna's husband.

108
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:04,399
Speaker 1: I think I Richie, you know, he only has a one trick but his trick is real good And I don't mind him doing that trick again.

109
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,847
Speaker 0: He dodges bullets.

110
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:10,863
Speaker 1: Avi It's like who else is a one-trick pony that does real good at that.

111
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:12,950
Speaker 1: one trick Nintendo Nintendo's real.

112
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, make a Mario game make another Mario game.

113
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:22,510
Speaker 0: See, I can't say Satoshi khan because wall you see something that he did and you think wow Satoshi khan did that?

114
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,708
Speaker 0: No, they're all still really unique and amazing and different.

115
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:32,396
Speaker 1: Yep It is sometimes hard to tell between someone who has a distinctive style Or artistic.

116
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:39,804
Speaker 1: I don't know theme Versus someone who is doing the same thing every time, you know, like Tezuka.

117
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,494
Speaker 1: if you see a Tezuka work, you know immediately It's a Tezuka.

118
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:44,828
Speaker 1: It's like, you know a Van Gogh painting when you see it.

119
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,650
Speaker 1: But Van Gogh is not a one-trick pony and neither is Tezuka.

120
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,473
Speaker 0: Well, the problem with.

121
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:50,622
Speaker 0: that is we'll get into in the rest of the show.

122
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:55,750
Speaker 0: to most people who read manga If you look at any manga from the 70s, you'll think wow, that's a Tezuka.

123
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:03,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, possibly Maybe so, but yeah, I guess you'd have to know who Tezuka was though.

124
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:04,410
Speaker 1: Some people don't even know.

125
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:09,334
Speaker 0: Well, if you knew if you showed him Phoenix and all those things look at this Look at this look at this.

126
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:12,250
Speaker 0: and then you handed him something else from the 70s and said look at this.

127
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:13,827
Speaker 0: They'd say by the same guy, right?

128
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,065
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

129
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:25,715
Speaker 0: now, there's a show in Japan called challenger on fire.

130
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:26,939
Speaker 0: I don't know very much about it.

131
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,027
Speaker 1: It involves setting people on fire.

132
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,897
Speaker 0: it might rabbit it might damn.

133
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:32,600
Speaker 1: that's awesome.

134
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,054
Speaker 0: I want to see this see the way this particular episode works.

135
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:46,560
Speaker 0: my thing of the day That is is that they've got a hundred people in Japan many of whom are cosplay And the goal is they've asked all of them to name a hundred anime characters.

136
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,992
Speaker 0: So they all sit there with a little whiteboard and a shield between all the people around him on this big thing And they'll show an anime character like cutie honey or tuxedo.

137
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:59,047
Speaker 0: come in or Asuka and then Everyone left to write down the character's name.

138
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,311
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

139
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,335
Speaker 1: I thought it was name on.

140
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:02,820
Speaker 1: I can name 100 anime characters.

141
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,030
Speaker 1: It was just naming them.

142
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,100
Speaker 1: I could come up with a hunch.

143
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:10,175
Speaker 0: I guess it's recognize and know how to spell the name of a hundred anime characters.

144
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:19,047
Speaker 1: see not that would be okay in English But it's actually harder in Japanese because a lot of the characters like a complicated kanji in their name and while you might go Oh, that's so-and-so.

145
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:25,840
Speaker 0: if you don't know the kanji your SOL I'm not sure the rules of how exact they had to be and you could always just write things out in Kana.

146
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,219
Speaker 0: So it wouldn't have been that big a deal.

147
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,404
Speaker 1: Yeah I could tell.

148
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:30,493
Speaker 1: I can always tell someone got it right because they would.

149
00:09:30,713 --> 00:09:31,015
Speaker 1: I couldn't.

150
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:33,428
Speaker 1: well I couldn't understand what they were saying 100%.

151
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:35,139
Speaker 1: you would see when they showed the answer.

152
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:40,231
Speaker 1: You know there'd be some symbols under the picture of the character And then you look at what the people wrote on their whiteboard.

153
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,820
Speaker 1: if the symbols match they got it right.

154
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:43,445
Speaker 0: I was very happy.

155
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:47,257
Speaker 0: I've learned enough hiragana that I actually recognized a few characters written names.

156
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:48,120
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

157
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:54,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I could only learn katakana and more than one kanji, and then maybe any amount of Japanese grammar.

158
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:55,409
Speaker 0: But anyway, I digress.

159
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:56,639
Speaker 0: now it starts out.

160
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:02,760
Speaker 0: Okay And very quickly the number of contestants dwindles because ever if you get one wrong you're out done forever.

161
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:04,265
Speaker 1: What single elimination?

162
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:05,289
Speaker 0: single elimination?

163
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:08,400
Speaker 1: that's tough especially if they throw like an obscure character right away?

164
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,993
Speaker 1: But what if everyone gets it wrong?

165
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:10,679
Speaker 1: does everyone out?

166
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,244
Speaker 0: I'm not sure how they did it.

167
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:24,938
Speaker 0: see the things entirely in Japanese and while I picked out a few phrases like at one point He says the anime loving fan in green has lost or something to that effect that I have no idea What was actually going on?

168
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,204
Speaker 0: But it's easy to see.

169
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:34,400
Speaker 0: you can watch and figure it out, and they always say the name of the character Even though they don't write it in English so you can play along with the game and see if you knew him.

170
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:39,060
Speaker 0: I'll admit that after the first few I didn't know any of them for a while.

171
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:43,218
Speaker 1: I barely knew any of them like I knew Asuka, and I knew Kenshiro.

172
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:43,560
Speaker 0: Kenshiro.

173
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:55,059
Speaker 1: I knew some other ones Yeah, but a lot of these are just obscure like I knew that one of the guys is from like the super plastic wrestling Whatever it is, but I didn't know the character's name.

174
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,451
Speaker 0: Well the funny thing was some of them that were.

175
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,440
Speaker 0: I had no idea never seen him before.

176
00:10:59,782 --> 00:11:03,420
Speaker 0: But you see all the contestants like oh duh, and they write it down like nothing.

177
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:07,493
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like that must be some show some old show that we've never seen.

178
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:09,560
Speaker 0: that must be like a goofy or a Donald Duck.

179
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:12,873
Speaker 1: You know this would be a fun thing to do at a convention.

180
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:16,546
Speaker 0: so actually I've already added that To our con repertoire.

181
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:27,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just need to get a hundred pictures of anime characters on a laptop, and then yeah That's like you're making a PowerPoint And you just push space to reveal the name and you push space to go to the next picture.

182
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:29,080
Speaker 0: I've already sketched out exactly how we'll do it.

183
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:36,740
Speaker 0: I'm gonna append to our Otakon I guess resume And we'll see if we do this at any cons with or instead of the anime match game.

184
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:38,340
Speaker 1: Let's prepare it and do it in the future.

185
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,680
Speaker 0: Maybe we could do it at katsu-kan or something we could do to some of the small cons this year.

186
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:57,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely like a test out, but anyway the other cool thing is that they've got some guests like special guests competing one of whom is Akira Kamiya who I've met at an amazement, and he is a super awesome voice actor who has been in pretty much everything.

187
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a big-time guy.

188
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,254
Speaker 1: voice acted a whole shit ton of care.

189
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:05,903
Speaker 0: He's right up there with my man Takahashi Rioske.

190
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:07,091
Speaker 1: you forget his real name.

191
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:11,218
Speaker 0: I do forget his me too But yeah, he's as good as that guy.

192
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:13,726
Speaker 0: yeah He's also super awesome and super funny.

193
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:18,520
Speaker 0: the field of competition narrows very quickly to these two dudes.

194
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:24,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of weird because the field of competition has some super nerdy people in it and some cosplayers And it's kind of scary.

195
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:32,929
Speaker 1: But the two dudes left at the end seemed kind of like normal geeky cool dudes and eventually the guy gets to like 75 if it comes down to one man.

196
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,105
Speaker 1: He makes it to like 75 or yeah cuz even though he's the winner He's beating everyone else.

197
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:37,930
Speaker 1: everyone else is out.

198
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,553
Speaker 1: remember.

199
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:40,080
Speaker 1: It's a hundred anime characters.

200
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,867
Speaker 1: He you know he has to make it to a hundred.

201
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:44,456
Speaker 0: now in the end you can't name 100 anime characters.

202
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:52,120
Speaker 0: in the end The saddest thing is the character that comes up is Zenigata from Lupin and now everyone knows that Agata.

203
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,983
Speaker 1: He knows an Agata obviously.

204
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,265
Speaker 1: I mean it's obvious.

205
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:56,887
Speaker 1: It's freaking said Agata.

206
00:12:57,048 --> 00:13:04,974
Speaker 0: It looked like he didn't know Zen Agata's full name or he had trouble figuring out what kanji to write and he Puts around a little.

207
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,083
Speaker 0: he failed and they knocked him out of the competition.

208
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:08,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he couldn't write the name correctly.

209
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,291
Speaker 1: That's.

210
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:15,489
Speaker 0: I need someone who understands Japanese to watch this and tell me what he actually wrote so I figure out why he lost.

211
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,590
Speaker 1: if He didn't know Zen Agata, then this completely changes everything.

212
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:23,390
Speaker 0: How could you know all those characters and not know Zen Agata?

213
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:26,766
Speaker 1: I don't know if an American knows Zen Agata, and you don't that's.

214
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:27,570
Speaker 1: that's for shame.

215
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:28,533
Speaker 1: All right.

216
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:31,363
Speaker 1: my thing of the day is a new blog.

256
00:16:09,665 --> 00:16:14,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway tonight We're going to review something that has come out very recently so recently in fact.

257
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:21,781
Speaker 1: if you Google around You're not gonna find too much about it unless you know how to type it in Japanese where I'm sure you could find a whole Bunch of stuff in Japanese.

258
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:37,458
Speaker 0: probably yes But Keiko Takemiya's to Terra or Terra a or towards the Terra or however you want to translate it it's a manga that was written in the early 70s by obviously Keiko Takemiya and Before we get any further.

259
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:39,974
Speaker 0: I just like to say that I really like it But maybe it's cuz.

260
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:42,570
Speaker 0: I've been on a kick for this old 70s kind of manga lately.

261
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:43,654
Speaker 1: I don't know.

262
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:51,950
Speaker 1: I think it's just this is the kind of thing that if my My likes were a bowling alley this sort of things is strike right down the middle.

263
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:55,018
Speaker 0: Oh, so you're into the shonen eyes space drama.

264
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:59,190
Speaker 1: No not really, but it's the it's see it's not really shown an eye.

265
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:00,449
Speaker 1: I mean well not yet.

266
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:02,115
Speaker 1: No Yeah as far as I can tell.

267
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:09,809
Speaker 1: see this is published by in the United States by By vertical ink and vertical ink are the people who published you know?

268
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:15,356
Speaker 1: ode to kirohito And all that other good stuff like now.

269
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:16,299
Speaker 0: it's very uh.

270
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,728
Speaker 0: vertical ink as in vertical incorporated not as in vertical ink.

271
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:21,950
Speaker 1: oh yes Yes, that's right vertical incorporated.

272
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:33,340
Speaker 1: And they published this and when they were marketing it right they were like check out the new sci-fi Epic from the master of shoujo Keiko Takemiya.

273
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,764
Speaker 1: well shoujo in space.

274
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,008
Speaker 1: It's Star Trek shoujo.

275
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:36,670
Speaker 1: check it out.

276
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,390
Speaker 0: They're really pushing it as though it's shoujo, and I've also seen a lot of people call it an emo manga.

277
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:46,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was on the bookmark that I took from the vertical ink booth at the New York.

278
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:47,855
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it is on this bookmark.

279
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:48,477
Speaker 1: It said.

280
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:49,200
Speaker 1: What does it say?

281
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,410
Speaker 0: read it the bookmark says in space?

282
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:59,889
Speaker 0: No one can hear you cry to Tara the hit sci-fi emo manga by shoujo master Keiko Takemiya.

283
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:08,250
Speaker 1: now I don't know if they're just lying with this marketing or Pretending that it's a shoujo in order to get sales because shoujo is popular in the US.

284
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,889
Speaker 1: I don't know, but first of all Keiko Takemiya is definitely a shoujo manga artist.

285
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:25,930
Speaker 0: well I think that is primarily because here they kind of say that oh from the master of shoujo See Takemiya is considered by a lot of people to be one of the founding mothers of shoujo as a genre or an idea.

286
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,048
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's pretty much invented like be shown and in shown and I type stuff in the 70s.

287
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:30,851
Speaker 1: Well, she was

288
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:44,228
Speaker 0: a part of this group of people called the fabulous 49ers who I don't know much about But according to Publishers Weekly they were a group of woman artists and writers who quote Established and solidified the girls comics industry in Japan in the mid and late 70s.

289
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:54,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently the other most significant person in that group was her former roommate, so It it's one of those tight-knit groups of people that you know busts out.

290
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:57,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I had heard the term fabulous 49ers before now.

291
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:58,428
Speaker 0: I know what that is.

292
00:18:58,448 --> 00:18:59,861
Speaker 1: yeah I think I heard a new world order.

293
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:09,375
Speaker 0: now There's also a claim that Takemiya gave rise or was the founder of the idea of the genre of Bishounen manga?

294
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:14,339
Speaker 0: because she wrote something called kaze toki no uta Song of wind and trees.

295
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,090
Speaker 1: I think I've heard of that before.

296
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:32,957
Speaker 1: Anyway, all that is true But if you read to Tara volume 1 without anyone telling you anything The only answer that I think you can come up with is that to Tara at least volume 1 is a shounen siren Sci-fi manga, it's not shoujo.

297
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:34,602
Speaker 1: It's not be shounen.

298
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:35,986
Speaker 1: It's not shounen.

299
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,110
Speaker 1: I it's a man.

300
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:37,332
Speaker 1: It's.

301
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:39,165
Speaker 1: it's like a Tezuka sci-fi.

302
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:39,930
Speaker 1: It's like Phoenix.

303
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:44,449
Speaker 1: It's the same exact genre as Phoenix volume 2 or Phoenix volume 6.

304
00:19:44,449 --> 00:20:03,390
Speaker 0: granted I can see how people might want to call it shoujo or have shoujo leanings because it does focus a lot on characters personal thoughts and emotions and Interactions and possible love triangles and all that sort of thing a lot more than what you might expect from a typical OMG people in space blowing things up Yep,

305
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:09,245
Speaker 1: and while there isn't any be shown and shown and I action in volume 1 there is definitely.

306
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:13,643
Speaker 1: I can definitely see the series Going there in volume 2 or 3.

307
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:23,140
Speaker 0: Well an ishi verticals director of marketing and publicity says straight out that the Homosexuality comes in later volumes and there are only three volumes.

308
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,465
Speaker 0: So it's got to be coming pretty quick.

309
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:33,830
Speaker 1: as long as it's not yaoi No, it is manga is good enough that I can tolerate some shown and I action if the story around it is good.

310
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:41,490
Speaker 1: It's sort of like how in ghost in the shell you tolerate the three pages of you know Random lesbians and big boobs because the story is still good enough.

311
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:51,079
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is those specific pages and that ghost in the shell while obviously no one can argue that they weren't just Gratuitous gratuitous horrible pornography.

312
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:56,438
Speaker 0: Yep at the same time the point that was being made There was actually fairly interesting.

313
00:20:56,498 --> 00:21:01,789
Speaker 0: It just probably could have been made in a less sheer otastic way.

314
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,594
Speaker 1: Perhaps perhaps it could.

315
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:10,957
Speaker 0: I mean I can think of a couple ways I could make that point perhaps with stick figures that would convey the same meaning.

316
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:14,682
Speaker 1: I Could convey the same meaning without any pictures at all.

317
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:19,670
Speaker 1: I Could just use some words and in many different languages.

318
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:25,349
Speaker 0: But anyway to Tara is a fairly complex story and it is written in the 70s.

319
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,693
Speaker 0: so the art looks.

320
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:34,479
Speaker 0: if you didn't know anything about this artist and you pick this up and you would read any of Tezuka's works you might just think wow.

321
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,829
Speaker 0: This looks a lot like Phoenix or a lot like Tezuka.

322
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:42,230
Speaker 1: Yes I mean I looked at it and I said wow, this looks a lot like Tezuka except there are two key differences.

323
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:47,105
Speaker 1: Number one the number one obvious difference between the art in this and the art in Tezuka's works.

324
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:48,710
Speaker 1: Is that the characters?

325
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:53,964
Speaker 1: Faces and head shapes are a lot more shoujo-y than Tezuka-y.

326
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:56,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have larger eyes larger pupils.

327
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're a lot more expressive and a lot more realistic with small noses.

328
00:21:59,892 --> 00:22:06,910
Speaker 1: Yep The bodies their bodies and like their poses and the clothing and all that sort of stuff is a lot like Tezuka.

329
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,297
Speaker 1: But the faces are definitely.

330
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:13,370
Speaker 1: they have a little bit of Tezuka in them, but they're mostly modern shoujo type faces.

331
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:22,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, though all the normal faces very often will cut away to almost Tezuka style humor or Little weird sketchy drawings or that sort of thing.

332
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:33,121
Speaker 1: Yeah, depending on the level of zooming and you know, if it's a little panel on the side It might be more like Tezuka, but if it's a big panel, you know Where someone's standing up and it's all close in on one character.

333
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:35,490
Speaker 1: You'll get the full drawn-out shoujo face.

334
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:52,950
Speaker 1: secondly when she draws spaceships or Mechanics or things she puts a lot more detail and draws it a lot more in a modern style than Tezuka Like Tezuka would draw like a cartoony spaceship like, you know a little pointy rocket bit with some holes in it.

335
00:22:53,010 --> 00:23:00,990
Speaker 1: You know like a little circular window She draws a highly detailed rocket ship that it looks a lot more like it would be fit into a Kira or something like that.

336
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:11,622
Speaker 0: then Anything Tezuka would ever draw though I remember if you read Phoenix you see that it uses a lot of very interesting Composition some of which works very well and some of which is just confusing.

337
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:17,229
Speaker 0: and there's a lot of that into Tara, too But it's a lot more subdued and generally makes a lot more sense.

338
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:27,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't seem too highly Experimental with like layouts or anything like that, but it doesn't just stick to normal boring layouts.

339
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:28,800
Speaker 1: There's definitely some exciting stuff.

340
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,008
Speaker 1: She just doesn't go crazy with it.

341
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:40,390
Speaker 0: Yep There's a lot of profile zoomed in shot on the side while people talk next to it or Various almost a montage of different things while speech is happening.

342
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:50,750
Speaker 0: now the story of two Tara is both simple and complex at the same time and Actually reminds me of a great many other words some of which came before and some of which came after this.

343
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you can't help.

344
00:23:52,395 --> 00:24:04,687
Speaker 1: but when you read this unless you are so uncultured and unwell read You can't help but feeling like you've read this story before like you've heard it before in a million other places Even if you can't quite put your finger on it.

345
00:24:05,231 --> 00:24:07,405
Speaker 1: And I wonder this was made in the early 70s.

346
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:14,569
Speaker 1: now was this the first time this story was told and we missed it until now because language barrier.

347
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:20,063
Speaker 1: or Is this just another telling of the story that we've heard a thousand times?

348
00:24:20,444 --> 00:24:22,510
Speaker 0: Well consider that it does remind me a lot.

349
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,829
Speaker 0: It's just of one thing in particular a brave new world.

350
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:29,121
Speaker 1: It's a little bit of brave new world going on there only in brave new world.

351
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:34,665
Speaker 1: The children were sort of engineered before Conception I guess, you know in test tubes.

352
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:38,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in this one They seem to engineer the children after they get out.

353
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:48,272
Speaker 0: see the story is that the earth at that we live on they call it Tara over time eventually becomes overpopulated depleted and generally Untenable.

354
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:51,080
Speaker 0: it's on the verge of collapse and humans can't live there anymore.

355
00:24:51,621 --> 00:25:05,344
Speaker 0: So with our vast technology we spread out into space and humans decide that the only way to save their planet and they also I guess they assumedly decide that saving the planet is the highest priority above all else for whatever reason

356
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:05,966
Speaker 1: that

357
00:25:06,387 --> 00:25:21,252
Speaker 0: they must strictly control the way the planet is used and not let everyone come back to the planet in order to Perfectly use all the resources and ingenuity that humans have available to make the earth the paradise home It once was.

358
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:26,690
Speaker 1: and to do this, of course, obviously you put a computer in charge because people suck.

359
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:29,300
Speaker 0: Yes, I believe they call it superior dominion.

360
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,010
Speaker 0: It's a system where children are born.

361
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:36,626
Speaker 0: This is this isn't really a spoiler so much because this is generally brought about early on.

362
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:40,890
Speaker 0: but we're not gonna go into very much Detail because there are a lot of things you really don't want ruin for you in there.

363
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,472
Speaker 0: There's

364
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:42,637
Speaker 1: a lot of things you don't want ruined

365
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:59,007
Speaker 0: but basically children are raised in space by the computer and by the system and then brainwash along with technology to Have the chance of actually going to earth and then it on earth putting all of their effort toward making earth a better place Or a habitable place.

366
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:16,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, it basically like they raise you in a certain way and then they fuck you and then they raise you in a certain way And then they fuck you and then eventually if you don't if you stick it within the system and you know Do that what the system wants you to do to the best, you know awesomeness and you're the super elite kind of guy.

367
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:20,768
Speaker 1: You'll end up on earth and now get to go to Tara where all humans want to go.

368
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,440
Speaker 0: now This is one nominally like a lot of stories.

369
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,670
Speaker 0: We've read before there was one volume of Phoenix That was very specifically about all of the migrants and emigres from earth long ago.

370
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:35,070
Speaker 0: Always want to return to earth and earth doesn't let him come back because it's too small and can't hold them.

371
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:41,150
Speaker 1: It's also similar to Phoenix volume 2 future where computers run the world because humans fucked it up.

372
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:52,268
Speaker 0: now that is the nominal background of what's going on, but the actual plot has more to do with the fact that a Byproduct of this system is that certain people bit by bit?

373
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,143
Speaker 0: Have started to manifest various things that you can almost call psychic powers.

374
00:26:57,203 --> 00:26:58,949
Speaker 0: In fact, it's frayed up ESP.

375
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:09,374
Speaker 1: Yep It's sort of this part of the plot with these separate people who are cast out, you know for having psychic powers feels a lot like x-men or Like the matrix.

376
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:13,008
Speaker 1: maybe you know where certain people get out of the matrix because they're different.

377
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:15,522
Speaker 0: now these people who have the ESP.

378
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:20,459
Speaker 0: they're called the moo are Killed or cast out as soon as they are discovered.

379
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,225
Speaker 1: Well, it's mu so it might be mu.

380
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:23,489
Speaker 0: It's probably moo.

381
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:24,508
Speaker 1: Yeah stuff to tell.

382
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:27,859
Speaker 0: Anyway, the they're cast out or killed.

383
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,810
Speaker 0: they they don't want people to even know that this sort of thing exists.

384
00:27:32,472 --> 00:27:38,970
Speaker 0: So the society adapts by coming up with ways to detect these people and dispatch of them early on so they can't cause any trouble.

385
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:47,205
Speaker 1: And of course, they're a group of them that were Unsuccessfully dispatched that are up to some sort of business.

386
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:48,830
Speaker 1: Yes that I won't spoil.

387
00:27:49,082 --> 00:28:04,558
Speaker 0: Yes You do learn this right away that some of the two of the early main characters who are obviously both moo and living among these exiled people are soldier blue the quote visionary first leader of the moo and Pfizer's the quote blind fortune teller.

388
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,708
Speaker 1: soldier blue is the best character in the whole manga.

389
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:09,479
Speaker 0: I don't know I really like Keith onion.

390
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:10,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's alright.

391
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,692
Speaker 1: If you haven't had any soldier blue you see the story

392
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:33,813
Speaker 0: starts with Jomi Marcus Shen who lives in a normal life is a normal kid kind of bright in this whole system and one thing leads to another and there are implications that he may or may not be a moo and His parents worry about this and his friends yell at him and I really don't want to go any further without ruining What happens.

393
00:28:33,873 --> 00:28:37,970
Speaker 0: because it goes the plot moves at a rather quick clip to put it lightly.

394
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:39,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it.

395
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:42,170
Speaker 1: even though the plot moves really quickly.

396
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:56,545
Speaker 1: I think it sort of has to move pretty quickly early on because the first at least half of this volume They're just sort of setting up the universe and the characters still I mean they introduced like really important characters Around the halfway point.

397
00:28:56,686 --> 00:29:05,090
Speaker 1: it's like whoa You know and it doesn't really feel like the actual Main story starts until like the last third or quarter of this volume.

398
00:29:05,231 --> 00:29:06,598
Speaker 0: Well, this volume has three parts.

399
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:15,450
Speaker 0: part one follows Jomi Marcus Shin the nominal main character through everything that happens to him his interactions with soldier blue and Pfizer's and it's good.

400
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:22,930
Speaker 0: Part two kind of starts the story over in that it gives the history and everything just like the first part did.

401
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:23,773
Speaker 1: Well, you got it.

402
00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:27,930
Speaker 1: I think the reason that's there is because it was originally published serially in some anthology.

403
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,205
Speaker 1: Yes, so you had to retell that bit.

404
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:37,790
Speaker 0: but also It doesn't even talk about Jomi or any of these people and it focuses on Keith onion and all the people around him.

405
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:48,636
Speaker 0: These are people who are a part of this system Very much the system that you didn't know much about but was hinted at in the first part and you see this whole thing again From an entirely different perspective.

406
00:29:48,997 --> 00:30:04,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of like here's something going on in this part of the universe you know in this period of time and here's something going on in a different part of the universe around the same period of time and Then of course as in everything that does this the two things collide.

407
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:05,130
Speaker 1: OMG

408
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:22,110
Speaker 0: Yes now I very much enjoyed the second part a lot more than the first part partly because now it's a much more clinical look at how the society actually works and Kind of the veil is pulled off from your eyes and now you see everything at least everything as far as the main character can.

409
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:33,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I did like the second bit more than the first bit But I felt like there was this potential of greater liking for this through the plot that was going on in the first bit.

410
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,848
Speaker 1: It just stopped advancing when it was gonna get to where I wanted it to be.

411
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:50,229
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure and maybe volume 2 it's gonna get there and that's the part I'm really gonna like the second bit which really lets you see kind of the inside of how the society works Reminds me so much that it's almost painful of the paranoia role-playing game.

412
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:59,390
Speaker 0: I would say that the the society that has been created here without ruining much is almost exactly in the spirit of paranoia.

413
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:05,830
Speaker 0: It doesn't have the same silliness that paranoia doesn't have the silliness depending on how you play.

414
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,596
Speaker 0: There are different ways to game.

415
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:08,238
Speaker 0: that that's true.

416
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:14,061
Speaker 1: And while the system is not as complex as the system in paranoia It is definitely reminiscent.

417
00:31:14,202 --> 00:31:15,891
Speaker 0: I think it is as complex inter I mean.

418
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:26,090
Speaker 0: they talk a lot about not fraternizing with people in different levels and there's the elites and Then there's the elite elites and there's the members and society is stratified and it's exactly like I mean paranoia.

419
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:35,969
Speaker 0: The game breaks up into three levels of I guess Cerebral ness when you play and this reads exactly like a game of the highest most serious level of paranoia would be.

420
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:47,583
Speaker 1: Perhaps perhaps it's definitely very similar And I wonder if the tell the guy who wrote paranoia ever read this as opposed to the first part Which in a few ways almost reminds me of Battlestar Galactica.

421
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:49,410
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

422
00:31:49,872 --> 00:31:52,442
Speaker 1: I definitely feel like it's more of an x-men kind of thing.

423
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,430
Speaker 0: What's the plot of Battlestar Galactica?

424
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:56,838
Speaker 1: You're in space.

425
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:58,450
Speaker 1: Some people are evil.

426
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:01,467
Speaker 1: You have to teleport every so minutes.

427
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,961
Speaker 0: All right Never mind that that's not the the relevant.

428
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,766
Speaker 1: No, but think you see how it goes with x-men.

429
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:08,548
Speaker 1: is that x-men?

430
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:09,110
Speaker 1: there are mutants?

431
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:11,872
Speaker 1: who are cast out of society and You know.

432
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:15,662
Speaker 1: next men like what most of times people tell the story of the x-men.

433
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:18,610
Speaker 1: they concentrated one character like kitty pride or something.

434
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,264
Speaker 1: they show someone who's a normal person and they're you know living with their parents.

435
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:29,230
Speaker 1: and then all of a sudden they find out they're A mutant and their parents cast them out and then they run away and then they find refuge with the x-men.

436
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:32,129
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm not disagreeing that x-men is also very much like this.

437
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:34,136
Speaker 0: But look at there's two things going on.

438
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:38,530
Speaker 0: on one hand this first bit with Jomi is very much the x-men thing of people who?

439
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,766
Speaker 0: Are different or cast out because they're different and normal people are afraid of them.

440
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:42,168
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

441
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:57,606
Speaker 0: but at the same time there's this whole idea that I think is going to be a lot more important later the Journey home trying to find your origin trying to get a group of displaced people Through the desert for 40 days and find home or paradise or whatever.

442
00:32:57,646 --> 00:33:00,877
Speaker 0: while this first part That is the true plot of Battlestar Galactica.

443
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:09,449
Speaker 1: while this first part of the first volume is a lot like x-men I definitely feel like it drops the x-men as soon as that first part is over and it goes into.

444
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:11,776
Speaker 1: you know The rest of the story which is completely different.

445
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:25,015
Speaker 0: now an ishi that that woman who is the public the PR person for this Says that to Tara was largely influenced by quote Japan student movements of the 1960s when college campuses became hotbeds of political unrest.

446
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:36,138
Speaker 1: huh, I wonder what sort of Political thing like ties this has because they don't know enough details about Japanese Politics to find any correlations between this and that.

447
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,943
Speaker 0: and also apparently the.

448
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:43,746
Speaker 0: the writer was very much a fan of Osamu Tezuka and she was influenced greatly by him.

449
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:47,130
Speaker 1: that was Painfully obvious just by looking at it.

450
00:33:47,210 --> 00:34:04,814
Speaker 1: yeah, it's actually really cool to look at this manga because I like Tezuka manga, and I like modern manga and You don't really ever get to see how manga got like it's like you know that modern manga that you read today like Death Note or one piece or Naruto is influenced by Osamu Tezuka.

451
00:34:05,034 --> 00:34:10,474
Speaker 1: all manga and anime is influenced by Osamu Tezuka the same way that all like Animation in the u.s.

452
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:13,304
Speaker 1: Is influenced by Disney because Tezuka was influenced by Disney.

453
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:14,389
Speaker 1: so I mean come on.

454
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:18,326
Speaker 1: But we see the modern manga, and we see the Tezuka manga.

455
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:23,150
Speaker 1: just because he's Tezuka We get to see his stuff, but you don't really get to see how it goes in between.

456
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:31,112
Speaker 1: It's sort of like if someone told you that you know there are monkeys And there are people and they never showed you the any of the in-between monkeys Which we have seen.

457
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:39,469
Speaker 1: and evolution is real, but with manga like I knew there was an evolution of manga But I never got to see the missing links, and this is one of those missing links.

458
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,270
Speaker 1: It's so half shoujo II style art and half Tezuka art.

459
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:50,330
Speaker 1: And it has elements a lot of elements of Tezuka storytelling and elements of modern manga storytelling, and it's together.

460
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:57,069
Speaker 1: yeah, and it's really cool because Manga from this era that I assume must be similar is not published in English.

461
00:34:57,169 --> 00:34:58,437
Speaker 1: often This might be the first time

462
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:16,030
Speaker 0: and even if you haven't read a lot of manga Don't worry about picking up something like this because while it's old it Reads a lot like modern manga and you won't have trouble following it for the most part other than there's a few times where it's Hard to tell who's speaking, but that's more just a function of how the art is done, and how the speech bubbles are drawn.

463
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:30,662
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know actually now that I think about it This could be not you know because it's a great work on its own But it might be a very useful work of all the people who like Modern manga, and they refuse to read anything that looks old or might be old.

464
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:42,070
Speaker 1: you could give them this and they could enjoy it You know because of the way it is a modern manga But you could use it as a bridge to pull them over to the other side and get them to read the older good stuff.

465
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:44,500
Speaker 1: You know that they are now that if they looked at now.

466
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,630
Speaker 1: They would be unwilling to read now.

467
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:59,902
Speaker 0: I believe it's worth mentioning that there was a movie adaptation of this made in I believe uh-huh, I don't know anything about it and I don't even know who the director is Hideo onchi.

468
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:01,850
Speaker 0: There's nothing on the anime news network encyclopedia.

469
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,439
Speaker 0: I didn't feel like doing any further research.

470
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,410
Speaker 1: I highly doubt this movie is available in English anywhere.

471
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:12,103
Speaker 0: It looks like it was released in the u.s.. On VHS in the 90s really.

472
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:13,207
Speaker 1: That's a VHS.

473
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:13,828
Speaker 1: I gotta get.

474
00:36:13,848 --> 00:36:17,358
Speaker 1: yeah I'm not looking at for that at the anime cons and the dollar bins.

475
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:20,086
Speaker 0: more importantly toward the Terra.

476
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:24,116
Speaker 0: a TV show is Debuting very soon.

477
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:26,063
Speaker 1: Yes in like in a few months.

478
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:41,590
Speaker 1: You're gonna see a few months now According to this April 7th so on April 7th like I guess the week after that because depending on how fast they fans of it You're probably gonna see to Tara episode 1 on the bit Torrance with subtitles in English.

479
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:47,310
Speaker 1: That's pretty freaking awesome a brand new anime series with modern animation, and it's gonna be way cool.

480
00:36:47,692 --> 00:36:49,647
Speaker 1: We should link to the Japanese website for that.

481
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:54,203
Speaker 0: well There's a picture here on the anime news network about it and the character designs.

482
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:56,570
Speaker 0: It's hard to say without seeing the move.

483
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:03,624
Speaker 0: I'm not sure it looks like they're gonna take a somewhat interesting take on Translating these character designs into animation.

484
00:37:04,126 --> 00:37:12,030
Speaker 0: I do think they're pretty though They remind me a tiny bit of duo say uh a tiny bit, but not they definitely have the old leaning still there.

485
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't seen enough of them But I they.

486
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:19,350
Speaker 1: I think they remind me a little bit from what I remember of like all the of the stars.

487
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,590
Speaker 1: Is you know like the crests of the stars and the banners of the stars?

488
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,101
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know how much of those have you seen?

489
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:27,165
Speaker 1: barely any cuz.

490
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:31,848
Speaker 1: I saw about half of Christ But I seen barely of that and I've seen barely of screenshots from this.

491
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:34,018
Speaker 1: so That's what I'm going on.

492
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:36,429
Speaker 0: and now what else can we say?

493
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:38,634
Speaker 1: It's an awesome manga.

494
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:39,938
Speaker 1: You should buy it.

495
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:45,111
Speaker 1: you can get this manga on Amazon for 12 less than $12.

496
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:49,529
Speaker 1: all right, it's like twice the size of a regular manga.

497
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:54,426
Speaker 0: yes It is quite hefty and there are only going to be three volumes, so you're not.

498
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:57,619
Speaker 0: even if you don't like it It's not like you're committed to something huge.

499
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you buy it, and you don't like it You don't have to buy two and three.

500
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:06,870
Speaker 1: no one's making you and if you do like it You can get the ending of this thing in two more volumes.

501
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:13,936
Speaker 1: You can have a whole manga series without having to buy a hundred volumes of something you know even like Death Note is like 12 Or 13 volumes.

502
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:17,989
Speaker 1: This is just three and on Amazon They're eleven dollars and sixteen cents.

503
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:22,545
Speaker 1: So you if you like it you have no excuse not to buy the whole thing and read the whole thing.

504
00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:30,888
Speaker 1: the next volume The current volume the first volume came out in February the next volume will be out in April and the final volume It'll be out in June.

505
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:39,043
Speaker 1: so if you're the kind of person doesn't like to wait in June just go out and buy all three at once and You probably won't have a problem if you buy them on Amazon.

506
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:46,809
Speaker 1: if you try to find them in the store You might have a little bit of trouble But I've actually seen these around so it might not be as hard as you think to find them.
