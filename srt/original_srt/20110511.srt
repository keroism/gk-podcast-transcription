1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,507
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, May 11th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:10,749
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:13,455
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,208
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,140
Speaker 0: Tonight, how we got into all this stuff.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,558
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,129
Speaker 1: So a couple days ago, biking over the bridge.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,448
Speaker 0: Biking over the bridge like you do.

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,010
Speaker 1: Coming over here, and I see this guy on a bike.

10
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:37,270
Speaker 1: And it's a normal bike with two wheels, pedals, seat, handlebars.

11
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,870
Speaker 0: And clearly some other factor.

12
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:47,030
Speaker 1: The seats and handlebars were like at least six or seven feet off the ground.

13
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,589
Speaker 1: And I'm like, look at this fucking hipster.

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,790
Speaker 0: So it wasn't a bike with one really big wheel and one really tiny wheel.

15
00:00:57,052 --> 00:00:57,294
Speaker 1: Nope.

16
00:00:57,718 --> 00:00:58,849
Speaker 1: It was a perfectly normal bike.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,230
Speaker 1: It just happened to be that the seat and handlebars and I guess pedals were elevated.

18
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,448
Speaker 1: You know, it was basically a very tall frame, you know.

19
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:10,630
Speaker 0: I'd be worried I'd hit my head on that bridge.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,179
Speaker 1: I also would, but I guess he didn't.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,549
Speaker 1: I don't know how he got on the bike to begin with.

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,268
Speaker 1: But I was like, look at this fucking hipster.

23
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,610
Speaker 1: And I wanted to take a picture and put him on that website.

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,750
Speaker 1: Look at this fucking hipster.

25
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:24,548
Speaker 1: But I was biking, so now...

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,070
Speaker 0: Now why is it that someone like that is now a hipster?

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,049
Speaker 0: When at RIT, someone like that was just a guy.

28
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,330
Speaker 0: Because there were people who did crap like that.

29
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,950
Speaker 1: No, they had unicycles, which were normal.

30
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:39,830
Speaker 0: Ah, they also, apparently now, there's that picture of that weird ass cow bike.

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,094
Speaker 1: Cow bike?

32
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:42,510
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, that's art.

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,910
Speaker 0: Is it art or is it a hipster?

34
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,366
Speaker 0: It's art.

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,468
Speaker 0: Hipster or art?

36
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:54,670
Speaker 1: The point is, now I'm thinking, right, I gotta get one of those, you know, sporty, wearing your helmet camera things.

37
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,490
Speaker 1: Whatever.

38
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:56,629
Speaker 0: They're not that expensive.

39
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,490
Speaker 1: No, but what's the one that the guy was wearing when he accidentally fell off the mountain and survived?

40
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,250
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't remember offhand.

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,450
Speaker 1: Because all the videos you see with that one are like ultra HD awesome.

42
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,750
Speaker 0: I saw a lot of people when I was skiing, right?

43
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,510
Speaker 0: They had flip cameras and they had things designed to hold a flip camera on their helmets.

44
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,269
Speaker 1: I don't want to do that.

45
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,230
Speaker 1: I want one of the ones that's designed to do that.

46
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,309
Speaker 1: And I don't want it to look dorky.

47
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,830
Speaker 1: It's gotta be, you know, it can't be like sticking out like an antenna.

48
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,290
Speaker 1: It's gotta be, you know, normal.

49
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,070
Speaker 0: See, I don't know.

50
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,310
Speaker 0: I thought it'd be cool in one way, but at the same time, I don't mountain bike anymore.

51
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,130
Speaker 0: So what are you gonna see?

52
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,690
Speaker 0: You're gonna see the same thing a car sees when it goes around New York.

53
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,688
Speaker 1: Well, no, but the point is, you actually see a lot more than what a car sees because you don't have a roof, right?

54
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,090
Speaker 1: So you have a much wider angle of view in general, even though a camera has a less angle of view than my eyeballs.

55
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,050
Speaker 0: But I'm saying in terms of me biking to work, you're gonna see what a car sees.

56
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,450
Speaker 1: Right, but basically what you'll do is, you know, I'll just leave it on whenever I'm biking around.

57
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:51,650
Speaker 0: Oh, and then if something happens, you go back.

58
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,310
Speaker 1: And if something happens, like look at this fucking hipster, then when I get home, I'll just edit that out and put it on YouTube and delete everything else on the camera.

59
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,344
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna, you know, make a video of going to work.

60
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:01,130
Speaker 1: That's boring as hell.

61
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:03,669
Speaker 0: Not a bad idea.

62
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus I can make videos like, "Look, this is how to get on the secret

63
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:09,069
Speaker 1: stairs.".

64
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,430
Speaker 0: I heard you finally found the secret stairs.

65
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,410
Speaker 1: I found the secret stairs.

66
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,090
Speaker 0: You see how they're kind of not obvious.

67
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,634
Speaker 1: Incredibly not obvious.

68
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:19,250
Speaker 1: There's no one even anywhere near them, which I don't think anyone uses them, which is why they're...

69
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,610
Speaker 0: I've never seen someone going in, but I've seen many people coming out as I was coming out.

70
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:24,849
Speaker 1: No, I'm going in.

71
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:27,277
Speaker 0: When am I gonna be able to go in?

72
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:30,070
Speaker 0: This weekend we're playing diplomacy and then I'm going to Spotcastle.

73
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:31,670
Speaker 1: I might go this weekend.

74
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,075
Speaker 1: Oh.

75
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,930
Speaker 1: 'Cause I'm definitely not going next weekend.

76
00:03:35,152 --> 00:03:35,777
Speaker 1: No chance.

77
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:37,289
Speaker 1: Maybe the weekend after that I could go again.

78
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,050
Speaker 0: What is next weekend?

79
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:38,843
Speaker 1: What?

80
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:39,550
Speaker 0: Alright, bar camp.

81
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,050
Speaker 1: Bar camp and also library overnight.

82
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,572
Speaker 1: Yeah.

83
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:46,530
Speaker 0: Come on, you can fit it in between the library and the bar camp.

84
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:47,710
Speaker 1: All two hours in between.

85
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,249
Speaker 0: Two hours, you could make it over the RFK and back down.

86
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,090
Speaker 1: Uh, from the library?

87
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:56,161
Speaker 0: Go from the library.

88
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:56,769
Speaker 0: Where's bar camp?

89
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,010
Speaker 1: Uh, on 50-something on 6th Avenue?

90
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,869
Speaker 0: I think in two hours you could go from the library, up...

91
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,670
Speaker 1: After being up all night?

92
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, over the RFK, back around, back to bar camp.

93
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.

94
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:17,649
Speaker 0: One time when I was in high school, I had more than 48 hours of not sleeping because I had an all-night party after school.

95
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,390
Speaker 0: Like a rollerblading all-night thing.

96
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:22,890
Speaker 0: And then the next day at a Quiz Bowl tournament, like in the morning, that was all day.

97
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,429
Speaker 0: And then that night, I went back to the school and we broke into the band director's office and painted it.

98
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:29,469
Speaker 0: All night.

99
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:36,930
Speaker 0: And then the next morning, as I was driving home, I ran a bunch of stop lights and then I fell asleep in my car, just parked on the street.

100
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:37,541
Speaker 0: Yeah.

101
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,041
Speaker 0: Yeah.

102
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,110
Speaker 1: Well, the library thing does have a sleeping room, but it's only for power naps, apparently.

103
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:44,669
Speaker 1: And, uh, yeah.

104
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,170
Speaker 0: You're not gonna wanna sleep through that.

105
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,610
Speaker 1: I might take the Friday off and sleep and wake up and go to the library.

106
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:49,873
Speaker 0: Ahhh.

107
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:50,662
Speaker 1: Anyway.

108
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:51,696
Speaker 0: Anyway.

109
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,189
Speaker 0: So, it's Wednesday.

110
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,990
Speaker 0: Tons of anime news.

111
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,590
Speaker 0: The industry is just abuzz with activity currently.

112
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,249
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sure.

113
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:10,930
Speaker 0: So, I wanna talk a little bit about, you know, I think the only reason it's becoming popular in our forum, in that people are talking about it, is 'cause there's no ponies anymore.

114
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:20,250
Speaker 0: I feel like ponies were drawing a lot of our forum's energy, and now that ponies are somewhat subsided temporarily, people are looking at other things.

115
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,110
Speaker 0: They're trying to get their fix.

116
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,409
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I tried- Any way they can.

117
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,390
Speaker 1: I mean, this pony energy, right?

118
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,070
Speaker 1: It was so forceful and it had direction, right?

119
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:34,790
Speaker 1: But now that the ponies have faded and it's going into another season, I tried to manually steer and funnel that energy in a different direction.

120
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,310
Speaker 1: And the direction I attempted to steer it was the best direction, Hajime no Ippo.

121
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:40,279
Speaker 0: Ahhh.

122
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:43,110
Speaker 1: I have transferred my pony energies in that direction.

123
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:50,070
Speaker 0: I have transferred mine into not consuming, like some people do, not simply watching what others have done, but making things myself.

124
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,068
Speaker 1: I'm also making things.

125
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,250
Speaker 0: While I'm behind on that pony video I've been working on for a while, it's almost done.

126
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:57,910
Speaker 0: And that other pony thing is almost done.

127
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, your pony energy has faded, huh?

128
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:01,749
Speaker 0: Now, they actually are almost done.

129
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:02,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have.

130
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,361
Speaker 1: The first 90% takes 90% of the time, and the last 10% takes the other 90% of the time.

131
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,730
Speaker 0: I have a third pony thing that interrupted them momentarily, and Kineticon.

132
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:18,710
Speaker 0: But the third pony thing is actually really easy to make, and much like Kanie a Pony does not have to be good because the concept is it.

133
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,249
Speaker 1: The Kanie a Pony was real good though.

134
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,222
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that was minimum effort.

135
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,390
Speaker 0: That was like BS effort.

136
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,048
Speaker 1: That was pretty good.

137
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:24,978
Speaker 0: Huh?

138
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:25,310
Speaker 0: Well.

139
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,410
Speaker 1: It was more well done than a lot of the videos out there.

140
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not saying that much though.

141
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,450
Speaker 0: But I'm gonna mash up Fluttershy and the dragon.

142
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:33,330
Speaker 1: Alright.

143
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,630
Speaker 0: With my year with the dragon.

144
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:37,250
Speaker 0: Good move.

145
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:37,637
Speaker 0: Yeah.

146
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,470
Speaker 1: You could also do Pete's Dragon.

147
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:43,150
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I wanna watch Pete's Dragon and do a show on it now.

148
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,370
Speaker 1: Or Puff the Magic Dragon.

149
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:44,750
Speaker 1: Eh.

150
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:46,870
Speaker 1: Or I am the last one.

151
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:51,510
Speaker 0: You know, as much as I hated that movie, I loved that movie.

152
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,709
Speaker 1: I know you loved that movie.

153
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,185
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the movie was bad in every possible way.

154
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:57,390
Speaker 0: The plot was bullshit.

155
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,290
Speaker 0: But it had Sean Connery playing a dragon.

156
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,390
Speaker 1: Usually the video, except instead of using either one of the two big dragons, do Spike or he's the last one.

157
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:13,963
Speaker 0: So anyway, Wakfu is basically, I saw this forever.

158
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:16,350
Speaker 0: There were ads and stuff about it.

159
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,350
Speaker 0: It was one of those things where you'd see it and say wow, that's a thing that someone is trying to promote.

160
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,625
Speaker 1: I thought it was a word that meant something like weeaboo or you know.

161
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:25,781
Speaker 1: Really?

162
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't know.

163
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:30,630
Speaker 0: I remember just at PAX there'd be gigantic things about this.

164
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,210
Speaker 0: It was like a turn-based tactical RPG MMO something.

165
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,909
Speaker 0: And I'd see this crazy art and I remember always thinking wow, that reeks of effort and ignoring it.

166
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,880
Speaker 0: Like just completely ignoring it.

167
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,050
Speaker 0: I mean, I ignore most things.

168
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:50,730
Speaker 0: It's not really a, I don't know, a complaint about a thing that I have ignored it because I have ignored the majority of things ever.

169
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:56,206
Speaker 0: And apparently among all the media blitz there is a cartoon in France.

170
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,130
Speaker 0: In French.

171
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,724
Speaker 0: And I watched an episode of it.

172
00:07:58,764 --> 00:07:59,230
Speaker 0: It was okay.

173
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,400
Speaker 1: But isn't this like a Square Enix thing?

174
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,230
Speaker 1: So why is the cartoon French?

175
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:04,835
Speaker 0: I don't know.

176
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:05,962
Speaker 0: I don't know much about it.

177
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:07,110
Speaker 0: But the cartoon is French.

178
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,567
Speaker 0: I guess they outsourced it to France because France is where most of the good animation that isn't coming from.

179
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:13,449
Speaker 0: Japan comes from.

180
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,240
Speaker 0: And America obviously.

181
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,670
Speaker 0: France is like big on the animation.

182
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:19,958
Speaker 0: And the cartoon is actually kind of funny.

183
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,343
Speaker 0: I don't know what I mean.

184
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:23,270
Speaker 0: I'm not even going to geek bite it yet.

185
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,054
Speaker 0: This is like a pre-geek bite.

186
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:31,610
Speaker 0: It might fill my need to watch something on this level until ponies come back.

187
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,770
Speaker 0: But it's not nearly as good as ponies.

188
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:33,643
Speaker 1: Hajime no Ippo.

189
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:34,110
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

190
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:35,328
Speaker 0: I'm also watching that.

191
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,251
Speaker 1: Alright.

192
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,688
Speaker 1: You haven't even finished watching Okotoro Cat, have you?

193
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,815
Speaker 0: I'm also watching that.

194
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:40,318
Speaker 0: But you know what?

195
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,470
Speaker 0: Unlike some people, I'm creating.

196
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,570
Speaker 1: I'm also making things slowly.

197
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:46,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, also slowly.

198
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,770
Speaker 1: It's harder for me to make a program than it is for you to make a Kanye video.

199
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I've been making programs too.

200
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're not making the difficult programs I'm making.

201
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,207
Speaker 0: Not yet, no.

202
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,276
Speaker 1: Anyway, so.

203
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,382
Speaker 1: Blackjack.

204
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:03,967
Speaker 1: Everyone knows Blackjack.

205
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,110
Speaker 1: If you don't, what the fuck?

206
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,670
Speaker 0: You should watch some Blackjack.

207
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,724
Speaker 1: And read some Blackjack.

208
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:08,009
Speaker 1: But anyway.

209
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,950
Speaker 0: If you like house, you'll like Blackjack.

210
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,090
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's a Blackjack OAV, and it's ten episodes.

211
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:19,230
Speaker 1: So ten separate VHS tapes or DVDs were released over the course of the years from 1993 to 2000.

212
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,558
Speaker 1: So yeah, they're probably VHS tapes.

213
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,650
Speaker 1: And it was one episode per tape, right?

214
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,389
Speaker 1: But for now, they're going to release an eleventh and final OAV.

215
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,030
Speaker 1: Ten years after volume ten, we're gonna get volume eleven.

216
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,353
Speaker 1: Wow.

217
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,276
Speaker 1: How about that?

218
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:34,010
Speaker 1: That's crazy.

219
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,998
Speaker 0: Was it done recently?

220
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,466
Speaker 0: Was it like in a hopper?

221
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:38,169
Speaker 0: Is it new?

222
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:45,470
Speaker 1: No, it says the Blackjack original video anime series by the late Osamu Dezaki will get an eleventh and final volume more than a decade after the previous volume.

223
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:58,100
Speaker 1: And the original voice actors for Blackjack and Pinocchio will reprise their roles, and they will record their lines during a live stream on Niko Nikodoga on Saturday, May 14th.

224
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,969
Speaker 0: That's actually pretty cool.

225
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,694
Speaker 1: Japan time, 1 a.m.

226
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:02,195
Speaker 1: Eastern.

227
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:03,497
Speaker 1: So if you're up at 1 a.m.

228
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:09,550
Speaker 1: and you go to Niko Niko, you can watch the voice actors record the lines for this eleventh...

229
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,559
Speaker 0: So I heard what happens in this episode, actually.

230
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,770
Speaker 0: It resolves Princess Knight.

231
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,949
Speaker 0: We gotta finish Astro Boy 80s, too, while we're at it.

232
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:21,769
Speaker 1: It's a good one.

233
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,230
Speaker 0: 'Cause we got most of the way through.

234
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,610
Speaker 1: I forget what episode we were on then.

235
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:25,528
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

236
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:30,410
Speaker 1: We watched the one where there was a train in the wilderness with all the whole class of kids.

237
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,330
Speaker 0: It went to the moon, all that stuff.

238
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,710
Speaker 1: Was that the same one with the bees, or was the bees a different one?

239
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,210
Speaker 0: The bees was before that, I think.

240
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:40,169
Speaker 1: I can't, I don't know.

241
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,550
Speaker 0: Let's pick a random, we should watch the end and go backwards.

242
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:44,770
Speaker 0: That's the easiest way.

243
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,109
Speaker 1: I think that's a bad idea, but yeah.

244
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:50,107
Speaker 0: Or Hokodona can, I kinda just guess, 'cause I always think, "Oh, I just watched episode

245
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,274
Speaker 0: 24.".

246
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:52,967
Speaker 0: "I will remember this, and then the next day I

247
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:53,410
Speaker 0: forget.".

248
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,896
Speaker 1: Here's a secret of space.

249
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:58,190
Speaker 1: Wikipedia has a list of episodes for pretty much every show.

250
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,049
Speaker 0: You just go and find the synopsis and be like, "Oh, I remember

251
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,150
Speaker 0: that.".

252
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:06,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anytime there's a long show, I just go wiki, space, list of My Little Pony episodes, for example.

253
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,649
Speaker 1: And then I look down the list and I find the episode that I'm on, and then I watch it.

254
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:14,847
Speaker 1: It works really well for Hokodona can episodes, 'cause there's 150 of them.

255
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:15,510
Speaker 1: Good luck remembering.

256
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,679
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

257
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,320
Speaker 0: This is not the greatest thing in and of itself.

258
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:35,600
Speaker 0: The product, the thing, that is my thing of the day, is a cool concept, executed, I would say, the bare minimum required.

259
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,300
Speaker 0: Like, this is the bottom of this kind of thing.

260
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:47,300
Speaker 0: But I think there's going to be a huge wave of this, like in the next five, six years or so, in terms of active prosthetics.

261
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,419
Speaker 0: Mostly for costumers, cosplayers, and furries.

262
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,240
Speaker 0: Basically, they're, you know, Nekomimi, the cat ears that people wear on their head.

263
00:11:57,722 --> 00:11:59,050
Speaker 0: But they're a little different.

264
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,277
Speaker 0: They're robotic.

265
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:00,780
Speaker 0: They move.

266
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,304
Speaker 0: They move around.

267
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:05,940
Speaker 0: They'll twitch, they'll go flat, they'll perk up, they'll turn at things.

268
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:09,500
Speaker 0: But the way they do this isn't just random or with switches.

269
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,680
Speaker 0: It actually has one of those kind of toy-level, shit-tier brainwave readers.

270
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:20,860
Speaker 1: Does it really read your brainwaves, or does it just say it does and it just sort of does things randomly?

271
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,619
Speaker 0: It's actually really easy to do that.

272
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:27,640
Speaker 0: Like, remember that toy that I think Dorkly did, or not Dorkly, before Bleepboop?

273
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,320
Speaker 0: They actually reviewed the Star Wars Force Trainer.

274
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,306
Speaker 1: The Star Wars Force thing, yeah.

275
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,240
Speaker 1: Isn't that just random and bullshit also?

276
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:33,561
Speaker 1: No.

277
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:34,745
Speaker 0: It's really easy.

278
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:39,360
Speaker 0: I mean, basically you look for certain basic patterns in the overall brainwaves.

279
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,138
Speaker 0: That sort of stuff is actually kind of easy to do.

280
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,779
Speaker 1: Cos I remember, you remember back in the day there was a thing you could put on your finger that you were supposed to control the computer mouse with it?

281
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,509
Speaker 1: That they was like, this was in the mid-90s.

282
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:55,400
Speaker 0: The things that we use now that do that and actually work are based on the same principles.

283
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,760
Speaker 1: I still have a hard time believing this principle isn't complete bullshit.

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,867
Speaker 0: You're completely wrong.

285
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:02,660
Speaker 0: Just absolutely.

286
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,120
Speaker 1: There's no way that it can actually be precise enough to where you're actually consciously controlling something.

287
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,675
Speaker 0: You're not consciously controlling them.

288
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:09,180
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

289
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:10,771
Speaker 0: I said shit-tier.

290
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:11,740
Speaker 0: This is the bottom type.

291
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,660
Speaker 0: The Star Wars Force Trainer and things like that, they basically read the most overall frequencies.

292
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,427
Speaker 0: Because it's pretty trivial.

293
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:23,080
Speaker 0: We could very easily build equipment that could scan that level of brainwave.

294
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,455
Speaker 0: You can tell if someone is excited, relaxed.

295
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:27,439
Speaker 0: That's about it.

296
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:28,289
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

297
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:28,718
Speaker 1: Yeah.

298
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,780
Speaker 0: So basically what these things do is if your activity goes up at all, they perk up.

299
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,569
Speaker 0: And if it goes down, they go flat.

300
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:39,460
Speaker 0: And I don't know what causes them to twitch.

301
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,550
Speaker 0: But it's kind of cute.

302
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:48,880
Speaker 0: And while this is not the best product, I really think that there's going to be a big wave of active prosthetics within the next decade.

303
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:53,760
Speaker 1: All I'm saying is I could make one that does things randomly and no one would be able to tell the difference.

304
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,360
Speaker 0: At the same time, while that is possibly true for now, it'd be pretty easy to engage in tests to prove how it's reacting.

305
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,038
Speaker 1: When we get to the point where someone can wear them and I could say, "Put them

306
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:04,279
Speaker 1: down."

307
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,963
Speaker 1: And they put them down.

308
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:05,668
Speaker 1: And I can put them up.

309
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,191
Speaker 1: And they put them up.

310
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:06,633
Speaker 1: Then that is...

311
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,949
Speaker 0: That's an entirely different kind of thing.

312
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:16,740
Speaker 0: And two, there are games, a whole class of games, they don't work that well, but they work okay, where you can learn to do things like that.

313
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you have like an fMRI and not a pair of cat ears.

314
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,319
Speaker 0: Actually, no, you don't need an fMRI to do things like that.

315
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,320
Speaker 0: Anyway, your ignorance aside, what do you have?

316
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,809
Speaker 1: So, I didn't have a good thing of the day.

317
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:35,460
Speaker 1: So I didn't want to use CollegeHumor as is our fallback.

318
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,259
Speaker 1: So I went to fallback number two, cinematicmassacre.com.

319
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:40,420
Speaker 0: Ah, shit.

320
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:44,639
Speaker 1: I haven't talked about them in a while, but I just want to remind everyone, there's a guy named James Rolfe.

321
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,544
Speaker 1: He is the awesome.

322
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:46,409
Speaker 1: He is like us.

323
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,280
Speaker 1: He is our kindred type person.

324
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,095
Speaker 1: Even though we didn't meet him, even at MAGFest, we wanted to meet him.

325
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:51,859
Speaker 1: And he was there.

326
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,740
Speaker 1: And he is the Angry Video Game Nerd, if you did not know.

327
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,500
Speaker 1: If you don't know the Angry Video Game Nerd, well, guess what?

328
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,644
Speaker 0: You know what?

329
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:04,100
Speaker 0: He's going to take you back to the past to play the shitty games that sucked ass.

330
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,807
Speaker 1: That's right.

331
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:05,679
Speaker 1: Well, they still suck ass.

332
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,080
Speaker 0: That song will get stuck in your head and you'll catch yourself humming.

333
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:15,000
Speaker 0: He'd rather let a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in his ear.

334
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,580
Speaker 1: He's been coming out pretty, you know, he used to come out with videos pretty irregularly, right?

335
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,759
Speaker 1: Except for the month of October, we had a video every day.

336
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:25,894
Speaker 1: He's been coming out with videos much more regularly as of late.

337
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,260
Speaker 1: At least one video every day.

338
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,920
Speaker 1: He'll even put out like a crap video or something that he just threw together just to put something out almost every weekday.

339
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,160
Speaker 1: And what he's been doing a lot lately is Ninja Turtles, animated Ninja Turtles.

340
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,060
Speaker 1: I think it's because he's rewatching animated Ninja Turtles, all of it.

341
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,440
Speaker 1: So it's on his brain, so he's making a lot of videos.

342
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,840
Speaker 0: I have this weird feeling that that show will not be as good as I remember it being.

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,920
Speaker 1: No, I don't think you should actually rewatch the show like he is.

344
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,560
Speaker 1: I think you should just watch his reviews of the show, where he's cut out clips and put them in an entertaining context.

345
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:03,480
Speaker 1: However, there's one particular Ninja Turtle video that is my thing of the day that he has put up, his most recent video as of this podcast.

346
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:06,779
Speaker 1: And it is Michelangelo's Pizza Taste Test.

347
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:14,919
Speaker 1: If you remember, during the Ninja Turtle show, Michelangelo would, you know, the animation at least, Michelangelo would- Was a party dude.

348
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,399
Speaker 1: He was a party dude, and he would always order pizzas.

349
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,500
Speaker 1: He was, he cared about, all the turtles loved pizza, but Michelangelo loved it ten times as much.

350
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,540
Speaker 0: Kind of like how in the Mario cartoon, they all cared about lasagna and pasta.

351
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:26,122
Speaker 1: Yep.

352
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:32,340
Speaker 1: Well, Michelangelo, if you don't remember, he always got crazy fucked up pizzas.

353
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,420
Speaker 1: Like pepperoni and marshmallow, or avocado, chili pepper- That sounds really good.

354
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:40,679
Speaker 1: Clam sauce pizza.

355
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:41,979
Speaker 0: That still sounds really good.

356
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:57,879
Speaker 1: So, James Rolfe and a bunch of his friends had a party, where they ordered a whole bunch of plain cheese pizzas, and they made every single one of Michelangelo's crazy pizzas by applying the toppings to the plain cheese delivery pizza, and I guess heating it up a bit.

357
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,440
Speaker 1: And then they took a pizza slicer and cut, you know, one slice of pizza into a bunch of little bits.

358
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,359
Speaker 1: So they each had pretty much a few bites of each nasty pizza.

359
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:09,179
Speaker 1: That way they had enough room in the stomach to try all of them.

360
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:18,560
Speaker 1: And he shows you pretty much a clip of Michelangelo saying what the pizza is, and then them eating it, and judging the different flavors.

361
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,898
Speaker 1: And it gets, uh, some of them are pretty nasty, some of them are not as nasty.

362
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:26,300
Speaker 1: Apparently anything with hot fudge was the worst.

363
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sounds about right.

364
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:29,952
Speaker 1: Yeah.

365
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:30,700
Speaker 1: This video's awesome.

366
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,019
Speaker 0: So, I'm hungry now.

367
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,700
Speaker 0: And it goes- I want that avocado chili pepper pizza.

368
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:42,059
Speaker 1: It goes very much in line with our Hacking the Boardwalk episode of, you know- Oh my god, I got a link to that now.

369
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,425
Speaker 0: Yeah.

370
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,209
Speaker 0: So, get to the meta moment.

371
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:45,779
Speaker 0: This is meta because it involves us.

372
00:17:46,280 --> 00:18:00,098
Speaker 0: But many years ago, and the fact that it was many years ago makes me feel really old, we were in Wildwood, our kind of perennial summer writer's retreat hangout where we dick around and don't do anything except sleep on the beach and eat Russo's Subs, 99 cent pizza.

373
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:07,060
Speaker 0: And one day, we just, you know, there's a place that has like deep fried Oreos, deep fried, you know, whatever.

374
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,260
Speaker 1: They're retelling a story that was already in a podcast that people can just listen to.

375
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,279
Speaker 0: Because that wasn't a podcast for many, many, many years ago?

376
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:13,398
Speaker 1: It's still there.

377
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,265
Speaker 0: Anyway, briefly.

378
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:18,500
Speaker 0: So, the guy was like, you know, he has all this stuff and he'll fry whatever.

379
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,339
Speaker 0: So, we go up to him, we're like, "If we bring you a slice of pepperoni pizza, will you deep fry

380
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:22,420
Speaker 0: it?".

381
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:28,640
Speaker 0: And we photoblogged us going through all of this and eventually eating the deep fried pepperoni pizza.

382
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:29,069
Speaker 1: Yeah.

383
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,700
Speaker 0: It was pretty epic and it tasted like a Hot Pocket.

384
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

385
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:39,600
Speaker 0: But this weekend, on Friday, is the Nerd NYC board game night where you're always at, at Think Coffee downtown.

386
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:40,279
Speaker 0: Yep.

387
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:46,177
Speaker 0: If you wanna hang out with us and actually hang out, as many listeners have been doing recently, come down, play some games.

388
00:18:46,197 --> 00:18:46,639
Speaker 0: We'll be there.

389
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:47,100
Speaker 0: We're friendly.

390
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:47,720
Speaker 1: Yep.

391
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:52,312
Speaker 1: Already mentioned, BarCamp NYC is May 21st and 22nd.

392
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:55,320
Speaker 1: You gotta go to the BarCamp NYC 6 website to register.

393
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,418
Speaker 1: It's free and then you just gotta show up.

394
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,216
Speaker 0: Tomorrow, Thursday, May 12th, from 7pm until whenever.

395
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:04,080
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly when.

396
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,912
Speaker 1: I thought that was Friday the 13th at 7pm.

397
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:07,296
Speaker 0: No.

398
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:07,777
Speaker 1: No?

399
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:08,879
Speaker 0: No, it's May 12th.

400
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:09,840
Speaker 1: Okay.

401
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,285
Speaker 0: 7pm, no quarter exhibition of games.

402
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,473
Speaker 0: This is in New York City on Broadway, 721 Broadway.

403
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:17,598
Speaker 0: It is an exhibition of games.

404
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,558
Speaker 1: Alright.

405
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:21,007
Speaker 0: It looks really cool.

406
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,640
Speaker 0: It's NYU's Game Center.

407
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:24,083
Speaker 1: Nice.

408
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:28,860
Speaker 1: Recess, Nerd NYC Recess is June 18th and that's all the events we'll talk about for now.

409
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

410
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:31,134
Speaker 0: PAX, PAX Dev, all that.

411
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:31,860
Speaker 0: We'll probably be at 'em.

412
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,979
Speaker 1: That's a long time from now.

413
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,253
Speaker 1: Yep.

414
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:39,800
Speaker 0: And you can't come, but this weekend we're playing an epic game of diplomacy for the worldwide championship belt.

415
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:40,962
Speaker 1: Yeah.

416
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,220
Speaker 0: We'll have some pictures of the winner, maybe some video.

417
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,785
Speaker 1: Maybe.

418
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:46,859
Speaker 1: And you should join our forum.

419
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,913
Speaker 0: Forum's rockin'.

420
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:56,120
Speaker 1: If you, you know, a lot of people out there, you're lurkers or maybe you don't do internet forums or you think you don't do internet forums.

421
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,507
Speaker 0: Don't do internet forums.

422
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:58,051
Speaker 0: They all suck.

423
00:19:58,253 --> 00:19:59,120
Speaker 0: Accept ours.

424
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:06,139
Speaker 1: Change your ways and go to forum.frontrowcrew.com, sign up, make sure you just, you can type something in the box that says "Why are you

425
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:06,480
Speaker 1: joining?".

426
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,249
Speaker 1: Just type, it doesn't matter what you type, you just have to type something.

427
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:12,380
Speaker 1: that makes me believe that you are not a robot, that you are an actual human being.

428
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,052
Speaker 1: And then you will be approved and then you can talk to everybody.

429
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,160
Speaker 1: and people are talking all the time about ponies.

430
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,080
Speaker 0: The real reason our forum is better than all the others, and you should know this going in, we have very few rules.

431
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,100
Speaker 0: You can do whatever you want as long as you do it with correct grammar and spelling.

432
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:27,710
Speaker 1: Yep.

433
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:28,654
Speaker 1: That's really it.

434
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,472
Speaker 1: Yep.

435
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:36,120
Speaker 0: So we did a slightly similar show a long time ago about how to get into all these things.

436
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,800
Speaker 1: How to get into, you know, it was a how to get into, I think, a week, right?

437
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,876
Speaker 1: It was how to get into, right?

438
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:46,260
Speaker 1: And it was basically, if you haven't done XGeekery, here is how to start doing XGeekery.

439
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,760
Speaker 1: And the thing is, the answer almost always is...

440
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,159
Speaker 0: Start doing it.

441
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,986
Speaker 1: Do whatever it is.

442
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:52,538
Speaker 1: I want to get into playing flute.

443
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:53,283
Speaker 1: Flute!

444
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:53,947
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

445
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:56,300
Speaker 1: Go get yourself a flute and start playing it.

446
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,480
Speaker 1: And go and get some flute instructional videos and search for how to play flute on Google and read the instructions and do it.

447
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,660
Speaker 1: And replace flute with anything, you know?

448
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:06,080
Speaker 1: I want to do electronics.

449
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,260
Speaker 1: Go buy an Arduino and just go to the websites, read what it says, and follow the instructions.

450
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,559
Speaker 1: That's how you do things.

451
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:20,800
Speaker 1: But we don't actually do a whole lot of, you know, personal reflection kind of podcasts on Geek Nights.

452
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:21,824
Speaker 0: Even though people want it.

453
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:25,420
Speaker 0: And I think what happened was we used to a lot more in the old days.

454
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:27,660
Speaker 0: Because we had a gigantic store...

455
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,280
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, we had Geek Fables were very...

456
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,960
Speaker 0: We had a store of anecdotes reaching back decades.

457
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:36,500
Speaker 1: And we... We used most of the notable and memorable ones.

458
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,140
Speaker 0: In well over 700 episodes of Geek Nights, we have talked about the bamboo.

459
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,990
Speaker 0: We've talked about the vision.

460
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:44,139
Speaker 0: We've talked about...

461
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,560
Speaker 1: The vision and the bamboo go together.

462
00:21:45,702 --> 00:21:47,100
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the vision happened.

463
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,300
Speaker 0: Well, the vision precursor was before the bamboo.

464
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,940
Speaker 0: But the vision culminated...

465
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,519
Speaker 1: Without the vision, there would have been no bamboo.

466
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,100
Speaker 0: That bamboo was one of the darker visions.

467
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,080
Speaker 0: That was perhaps the worst thing that has ever happened.

468
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,994
Speaker 0: What do you see?

469
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:00,238
Speaker 0: Bamboo!

470
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:03,580
Speaker 0: What do you smell?

471
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,023
Speaker 1: No.

472
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:06,260
Speaker 1: Anyway.

473
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,980
Speaker 1: You know, but the other thing is, you know, I've said this before.

474
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:17,800
Speaker 1: But I want to try to make it so that, you know, if there's a Geek Nights episode, that anyone who... Even if it's your... Any episode should be able to be someone's first episode.

475
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,459
Speaker 1: So we shouldn't talk about anything that's like community based or so personal that it excludes...

476
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,676
Speaker 0: Like, "Oh, Amnushu was doing something on the

477
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:26,059
Speaker 0: farm.".

478
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:26,500
Speaker 0: Right.

479
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,920
Speaker 1: So anyone who isn't already a Geek Nights listener doesn't give two shits about that.

480
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,258
Speaker 1: But this, you know, if we talk about our own personal stories, how did you start... How did you discover X?

481
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,139
Speaker 0: No, Scott, I'm worried here.

482
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:43,680
Speaker 0: We're starting this show by rationalizing why we're doing this show.

483
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,444
Speaker 0: We're like, "Don't worry.

484
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:45,008
Speaker 0: Don't worry.

485
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,075
Speaker 0: Here's why we're doing it.

486
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:46,257
Speaker 1: It's

487
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:46,559
Speaker 1: okay.".

488
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,879
Speaker 1: Well, because if any time you do something contrary to your philosophy on the internet, you risk being called out.

489
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:53,600
Speaker 0: How is this in any way contrary?

490
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
Speaker 0: No, in fact, people like the anecdotes.

491
00:22:57,321 --> 00:23:02,380
Speaker 0: The only time people get mad and call us out is when you talk about politics.

492
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:04,859
Speaker 1: Which I don't want to talk about.

493
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:05,768
Speaker 0: I always do.

494
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:06,839
Speaker 0: I can hit Scogeal on here.

495
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:07,819
Speaker 1: Anyway.

496
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:10,520
Speaker 0: So, let's start with comics.

497
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,940
Speaker 0: Regular superhero comics.

498
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,269
Speaker 1: Well, it doesn't have to be superhero.

499
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:15,660
Speaker 1: I mean, comics are comics, right?

500
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,060
Speaker 0: Ah, but I got into... Well, I had three levels of comics.

501
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,800
Speaker 0: The first comics I got into were actually just, you know, Foxtrot kind of comics.

502
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,380
Speaker 0: Bloom County.

503
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:23,840
Speaker 1: I think everyone was that way.

504
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,020
Speaker 1: Reading comics in the newspaper before reading any other sorts of comics.

505
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:41,560
Speaker 0: If I think way back, the first newspaper comics that I was aware of... Like, I, as a sentient human, recognized that what I was reading was a comic in a newspaper, and that I was enjoying, was Calvin and Hobbes, probably.

506
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

507
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,520
Speaker 0: Maybe a lot of that crap like High and Lowest and Cathy, because it was just there, and I'd read it.

508
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, like, in those early days, reading comics in the newspaper, it was like a lot...

509
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,378
Speaker 0: I'd just read them all.

510
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:55,640
Speaker 1: I hated... I just, like, ignored the vast majority of them.

511
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:56,794
Speaker 0: I hated them all.

512
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:57,320
Speaker 0: Almost.

513
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,794
Speaker 0: But I read them all anyway.

514
00:23:58,835 --> 00:23:59,299
Speaker 0: You know why?

515
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,420
Speaker 0: Because I was sitting at the table, eating a bowl of cereal.

516
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,045
Speaker 0: And you know what?

517
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:04,055
Speaker 0: When you're eight...

518
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:05,440
Speaker 1: What are you gonna read?

519
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:09,480
Speaker 0: When you're eight, eating a bowl of cereal might as well take four years.

520
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,207
Speaker 1: You're gonna read it?

521
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:11,280
Speaker 1: Is he gonna read the cereal box?

522
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,286
Speaker 0: That is infinite time.

523
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:13,440
Speaker 0: You've already read the cereal box.

524
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,579
Speaker 1: And you've already done the mini page.

525
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,331
Speaker 0: There's this great cyanide and happiness recently.

526
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:19,260
Speaker 0: A guy goes into the shitter to take a shit, right?

527
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,766
Speaker 0: He sits down and he's like, "Oh, no.

528
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:22,173
Speaker 0: I forgot my smartphone.

529
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:23,017
Speaker 0: What'll I

530
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:23,238
Speaker 0: do?".

531
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,730
Speaker 0: And then it has this series of frames of, like, zooming in on his eye, and then his eye becomes stars, and endless cosmos has come and go.

532
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:32,460
Speaker 0: The infinite passing of epochs.

533
00:24:35,222 --> 00:24:37,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you think we're impatient now?

534
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:37,699
Speaker 0: When I was eight?

535
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,940
Speaker 0: So I'd read the entirety of the funnies, and I don't know why.

536
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,000
Speaker 1: I skipped over the Rex Morgan MDs and the funky winker beans.

537
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,100
Speaker 0: The thing is, Rex Morgan, there were two words in the whole comic.

538
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,793
Speaker 1: Or apartment 3Gs.

539
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,285
Speaker 0: So you say you don't read.

540
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:52,667
Speaker 0: You know what?

541
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:54,639
Speaker 0: I read them because there was nothing in them.

542
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:56,427
Speaker 0: I did not process.

543
00:24:56,688 --> 00:24:58,599
Speaker 0: I saw, but did not see.

544
00:24:59,443 --> 00:25:03,240
Speaker 1: What always did bother me, though, was some newspapers that have some comics and others wouldn't.

545
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,860
Speaker 0: Oh, that was the worst, because we got the Detroit News.

546
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,200
Speaker 1: Sometimes you'd get a comic on Sunday, but you wouldn't get it during the week.

547
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,000
Speaker 0: Ah, we got the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press, so we got all the good comics.

548
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:17,000
Speaker 0: But if I went to anyone else's house and they got some shit newspaper, I'd stay over at a friend's house and they'd have USA Today.

549
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:19,425
Speaker 1: It was weird, though, right?

550
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:27,920
Speaker 1: Because even though I read comics in the newspaper, I had absolutely no interest in actual comic books.

551
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:35,000
Speaker 1: I knew they existed, and I knew who these characters were because I watched 60s Batman reruns on TV.

552
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:37,009
Speaker 1: So I knew when I saw Batman '89.

553
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,160
Speaker 1: I knew who all these superheroes were.

554
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,664
Speaker 1: Superman.

555
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:41,379
Speaker 1: Of course I knew who Superman and Spider-Man were.

556
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,708
Speaker 1: But I had absolutely no interest in reading comics.

557
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:44,813
Speaker 1: I looked down on comics.

558
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:46,440
Speaker 1: I didn't want to read comic books.

559
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,398
Speaker 0: Well, see, I had this weird thing.

560
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:48,809
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

561
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:49,540
Speaker 1: I just didn't want to read them.

562
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:58,260
Speaker 0: The moment where I went from reading the newspaper comics because, literally, I had infinite amounts of time and I had to do something or I would have gone crazy.

563
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:05,680
Speaker 0: I was when my parents would buy the Bloom County compilation, the big book of Calvin and Hobbes.

564
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, we never bought any of those.

565
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,065
Speaker 0: We bought all of those.

566
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:16,980
Speaker 0: So basically, as soon as those appeared in my life, I read them and comics went from this kind of nothing activity to something I actively seeked out.

567
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:20,240
Speaker 0: And as a result, I only sought these specific comics that were good.

568
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:25,120
Speaker 0: From then on, I really only read Calvin and Hobbes, Foxtrot, Overboard.

569
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,600
Speaker 0: For some reason, I have this weird fondness for Overboard.

570
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,600
Speaker 1: I don't even know what Overboard is.

571
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,845
Speaker 1: Really?

572
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:29,480
Speaker 1: It was about pirates.

573
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:32,360
Speaker 1: We don't have that one, but now I wish we had that one because it's about pirates.

574
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,283
Speaker 0: It's about pirates.

575
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:36,600
Speaker 0: Imagine if Dilbert were about pirates.

576
00:26:37,482 --> 00:26:39,019
Speaker 0: That's really the best way I can describe it.

577
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,420
Speaker 1: I even had one of my friends gave me an X-Men coloring book that was early '80s X-Men.

578
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,751
Speaker 1: I was like, "Who the hell are the

579
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:47,872
Speaker 1: X-Men?".

580
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:54,500
Speaker 0: I also had, maybe it was just my family, we had every Mad Magazine going back to almost the beginning.

581
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,246
Speaker 1: My mom still has them.

582
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:56,336
Speaker 0: Every goddamn Mad Magazine.

583
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,360
Speaker 1: Did not have any Mad Magazines.

584
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,460
Speaker 1: But I knew that it existed and I had no interest.

585
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,920
Speaker 0: In fact, a lot of them are pretty valuable today because they're all in me condition.

586
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,780
Speaker 0: So as a kid, shortly after that, after reading all these other comics, I found this Mad collection.

587
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,718
Speaker 0: I read every one of them.

588
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,160
Speaker 0: We also had these old, they smelled like old people books of peanuts.

589
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,440
Speaker 0: I've read almost every Peanuts comic ever.

590
00:27:18,662 --> 00:27:20,640
Speaker 1: I read those in my elementary school library.

591
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,457
Speaker 1: They're like little paperback ones.

592
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, the little paperback ones that smelled bad and fell apart.

593
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,652
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

594
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:26,140
Speaker 1: Same ones.

595
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,840
Speaker 0: So that is how I got into comics.

596
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,560
Speaker 0: In fact, my mom had all these old Fantastic Fours that I didn't like, but they were there.

597
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:38,460
Speaker 0: I really only liked Peanuts and Overboard and Bloom County and all that.

598
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:40,560
Speaker 0: That's actually kind of an aside.

599
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,840
Speaker 0: That's how I got into politics.

600
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,499
Speaker 0: Because as a kid, you don't really know.

601
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:48,779
Speaker 0: When I was young, I didn't know right wing, left wing, Republican, anything at all.

602
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:49,759
Speaker 1: I didn't either.

603
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,260
Speaker 0: I knew the Soviets want Anukas and the basic things that kids know.

604
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,839
Speaker 1: I didn't even know that until at that time.

605
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,040
Speaker 0: And I was really interested in the Gulf War because I was convinced that I knew how to fix it.

606
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,380
Speaker 0: And that it was my duty to tell President Bush.

607
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,860
Speaker 0: And I got kind of frustrated and disturbed as a kid.

608
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,400
Speaker 0: I was worried that if I didn't tell an adult, that the war would keep going.

609
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,179
Speaker 0: And I started to feel responsible for the war.

610
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:11,791
Speaker 1: Okay.

611
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,119
Speaker 0: I was a weird kid.

612
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:20,560
Speaker 0: But I got into politics because I read Bloom County so much that I knew all the proper nouns of 80s politics in the US.

613
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,240
Speaker 1: See, because I read a lot of those comics and I didn't even understand that they were political.

614
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,159
Speaker 1: Because a lot of them all basically have other jokes at the same time.

615
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I got interested in both.

616
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,160
Speaker 0: Or at least I'd recognize names of people.

617
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,320
Speaker 1: This is elementary school we're talking about.

618
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:38,760
Speaker 0: So that's how I got into politics.

619
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,740
Speaker 0: But that's also how I got into comics, reading these big compilation books.

620
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:44,300
Speaker 1: See, what happened to me, right?

621
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,080
Speaker 0: Didn't read superheroes because I thought they were stupid.

622
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,900
Speaker 0: Even as a little kid, I thought Superman was stupid.

623
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:48,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did too.

624
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,575
Speaker 1: But it's like, I didn't actively think he was stupid.

625
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:54,960
Speaker 1: I just kind of didn't care at all.

626
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:57,420
Speaker 0: I thought superheroes were stupid as a kid.

627
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,960
Speaker 0: I just thought they were a dumb thing and I wasn't interested in them.

628
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,092
Speaker 1: I mean, I liked 60s Batman when I was in elementary school.

629
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,000
Speaker 0: With Adam West, I watched that movie endlessly.

630
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:08,440
Speaker 1: I never actually saw that until much later.

631
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,039
Speaker 1: But the '89 Batman I liked.

632
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,419
Speaker 0: We had a VHS tape of it that I'd watch every now and then.

633
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:14,532
Speaker 1: But it wasn't until like in the early 90s, like '91, right?

634
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,120
Speaker 1: I guess it was '09 or '10, '08, '09, '10, something like that, right?

635
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,460
Speaker 1: My friend down the street who I'd go over to his house, he suddenly was reading comic books.

636
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,177
Speaker 1: And I was like, what?

637
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,559
Speaker 1: Because no one I knew had ever read comic books.

638
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:28,680
Speaker 1: And I didn't care.

639
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:34,200
Speaker 0: There were like one or two nerdy kids in my school who, you know, I was nerdy but in different ways, who read comics.

640
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,639
Speaker 0: And everyone else, just no one cared about comics.

641
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,554
Speaker 1: It's like I saw Dennis the Menace reading comics in cartoons.

642
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:41,340
Speaker 1: Or I saw Calvin reading comics.

643
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,419
Speaker 0: I had this weird impression of superhero comics.

644
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,360
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just because the only comics in my house were really, really old comics.

645
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,520
Speaker 0: And I'd only ever see comics in old comics, referring to people reading comics.

646
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,660
Speaker 0: Comics were a thing that kids in the 20s read that nobody cares about today.

647
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,420
Speaker 0: I thought they were like this archaic, lost art form.

648
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd never actually seen people with comic books.

649
00:30:03,023 --> 00:30:06,440
Speaker 1: Even though I sort of knew they existed, I didn't want or care to read them.

650
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,280
Speaker 1: But then a kid down the street got them and he was reading like Iron Man and Moon Knight.

651
00:30:12,005 --> 00:30:12,620
Speaker 0: Moon Knight?

652
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:13,519
Speaker 1: You know Moon Knight?

653
00:30:13,662 --> 00:30:14,420
Speaker 0: I know about Moon Knight.

654
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,560
Speaker 1: And like Infinity Gauntlet and Morbius and all this stuff.

655
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,660
Speaker 1: And I was like, okay, whatever.

656
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:22,138
Speaker 1: And I didn't really read them, but you know what I did do?

657
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:25,072
Speaker 1: I started collecting, obviously this was the early 90s.

658
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,139
Speaker 0: The cards?

659
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:27,775
Speaker 1: Yeah.

660
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,340
Speaker 0: I collected the cards before I learned who the X-Men were from collecting the X-Men cards because those cards had stats on the back.

661
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:36,257
Speaker 0: Yup, yup.

662
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:40,320
Speaker 0: And for some reason I was like, whoa, Wolverine has the strength of that?

663
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:41,840
Speaker 0: But this Jean Grey character?

664
00:30:42,451 --> 00:30:42,758
Speaker 0: Yup, yup.

665
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,720
Speaker 0: And I got really interested based on that and that alone.

666
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,420
Speaker 1: So in the early 90s, right, there was sort of this explosion.

667
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,380
Speaker 1: Like friend down the street is reading comics.

668
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,960
Speaker 1: I didn't really read any of his comics, but I saw that he was reading them.

669
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,880
Speaker 1: And then comic book shock opens in the mall, right near my house.

670
00:30:57,541 --> 00:31:01,413
Speaker 1: And then I went to the comic shop in the mall and I was collecting baseball cards.

671
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:03,460
Speaker 1: at the time, you know, because I had been doing that.

672
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,499
Speaker 0: I never collected those.

673
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:08,859
Speaker 1: Well, my dad basically would like buy a pack every week and so it just built up.

674
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:11,760
Speaker 1: I also would do like those sticker books.

675
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,260
Speaker 1: Like I have an Alf sticker book that has 3D glasses.

676
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,140
Speaker 0: I had a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles one.

677
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:16,798
Speaker 1: I had that one.

678
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,188
Speaker 0: Yeah.

679
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,680
Speaker 1: And those were basically cards, but every, you know, the cards had two stickers.

680
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,860
Speaker 0: I collected a lot of weird things along those lines.

681
00:31:23,221 --> 00:31:26,040
Speaker 0: Like Beavis and Butthead, there was a trading card series that I just had.

682
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,280
Speaker 1: I had an Alf trading card series.

683
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:30,279
Speaker 0: I had all the Nintendo ones.

684
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,518
Speaker 1: I didn't have Nintendo ones.

685
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,660
Speaker 0: But it's weird that we collected those cards for the comic books, but didn't read the comic books.

686
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,298
Speaker 1: Well, I did.

687
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:39,720
Speaker 1: See, it was basically shortly after, right?

688
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,639
Speaker 1: So it's like the X-Men cartoon came onto TV.

689
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,240
Speaker 1: You know, my friend down the street was reading comics.

690
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,491
Speaker 0: X-Men cartoon is.

691
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:47,119
Speaker 0: what did it for me.

692
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,320
Speaker 1: I was going to the comic book store to buy these cards, right?

693
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,320
Speaker 1: And then, you know, I bought, I started buying comics.

694
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,720
Speaker 1: And basically the thing was I didn't have a lot of money as a punk kid, right?

695
00:31:57,841 --> 00:32:00,620
Speaker 1: And I spent most of the money on the cards, which are actually really expensive.

696
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:06,060
Speaker 1: So the only two comics I read as a kid were Spider-Man 2099 and Adjectiveless X-Men.

697
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,900
Speaker 1: And barely anything else at all.

698
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,980
Speaker 0: Ah, for me it was the Uncanny X-Men and X-Men, and X-Factor and X-Force.

699
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:18,020
Speaker 0: Because basically I knew, by then I knew about the X-Men and I was collecting the cards, but I didn't read the comics at all.

700
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,440
Speaker 0: And independently, you know, when the cartoon came out, I got really into the cartoon, but not anything else.

701
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,320
Speaker 0: Like just the cartoon was all I liked.

702
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,499
Speaker 0: I didn't care about the comics related to it.

703
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:34,000
Speaker 0: But, around all those times, comic books got suddenly popular.

704
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,380
Speaker 0: Like suddenly I started seeing everyone around reading them.

705
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:41,560
Speaker 1: Well, it was because people, you know, there was a huge speculation boom going on.

706
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,698
Speaker 1: Which was pretty much the story of comics in the 90s.

707
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,938
Speaker 0: So I was into board games.

708
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,060
Speaker 1: Of course, being young impressionable 10 year olds, we got caught up in that real easily.

709
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,629
Speaker 0: But I was into board games, right?

710
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,320
Speaker 0: So I got this X-Men board game.

711
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:54,060
Speaker 0: And it was pretty shit.

712
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:57,320
Speaker 0: But it came with all these figures that I painted poorly.

713
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:01,400
Speaker 0: And it came with one copy of X-Men.

714
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,840
Speaker 0: And it was right after the end of the Executioner's Song was where that comic was.

715
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:06,280
Speaker 0: Yup.

716
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,404
Speaker 1: You know what?

717
00:33:07,504 --> 00:33:10,358
Speaker 1: Executioner's Song trade paperback is coming out real soon.

718
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:10,820
Speaker 1: I'm ordering it.

719
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,980
Speaker 0: Oh shit, I should read that.

720
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,580
Speaker 0: That's the only, that is the only story in all of X-Men I've read all the way through.

721
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:18,760
Speaker 1: Ever.

722
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:23,960
Speaker 0: So basically, this comic that came with the game was like the denouement to that.

723
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,539
Speaker 0: It was like Beast and Cyclops just talking about all the shit that went down.

724
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,773
Speaker 0: And I was like, this isn't what I expected.

725
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:31,719
Speaker 0: It's mostly words.

726
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:39,120
Speaker 1: Well, that was, you know, it was probably Claremont who was the wordiest, you know, Claremont and Burn are the wordiest motherfuckers in the universe.

727
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,650
Speaker 0: And as a result, I got this mistaken impression.

728
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,060
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, comics are actually kind of erudite.

729
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,029
Speaker 0: Look at all that metaphor.

730
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:45,554
Speaker 0: Mmm.

731
00:33:46,664 --> 00:33:47,318
Speaker 1: They were trying to be.

732
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:48,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't know better.

733
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,740
Speaker 0: So then I went and I bought the comic that came before that one.

734
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,140
Speaker 0: And then I realized there was this story and I had to buy a bunch of X-Factors and X-Forces and all this bullshit.

735
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,830
Speaker 0: And I got it all.

736
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:01,020
Speaker 0: And I read it all.

737
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:06,320
Speaker 0: And I kept reading X-Men from that point until about Phalanx, all that stuff.

738
00:34:07,022 --> 00:34:08,049
Speaker 0: And then I just stopped.

739
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:09,520
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell you why.

740
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:10,266
Speaker 1: I stopped.

741
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:11,560
Speaker 1: I can tell you exactly why I stopped.

742
00:34:11,621 --> 00:34:13,320
Speaker 1: Because the comic book store in the mall went out of business.

743
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:16,580
Speaker 1: So I couldn't get, I couldn't get the next comic.

744
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,634
Speaker 1: So then basically I just, you know, it's weird.

745
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:20,840
Speaker 1: It's like the comic store disappeared.

746
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:30,880
Speaker 1: And I was just like, uh, I mean, X, something happened in X-Men, uh, like around issue 30, 31, where it's like one issue, like skipped a bunch of plot.

747
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,831
Speaker 1: And I was like, what the fuck?

748
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:32,620
Speaker 1: or whatever.

749
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:36,759
Speaker 1: And I really only cared about Spider-Man 2099 because X-Men dicked me over like that.

750
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,639
Speaker 1: But then the comic store closed and I couldn't get the next issue.

751
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:48,043
Speaker 1: And I tried like a little bit and then I gave up until the year like 2001.

752
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:48,284
Speaker 1: Right.

753
00:34:48,364 --> 00:34:51,280
Speaker 1: In the year 2001, I can tell you exactly what happened because it's much more recent.

754
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,880
Speaker 1: Uh, I was already back into the animes, right?

755
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:00,060
Speaker 1: We were at RIT and, uh, we went to Borders a lot to look at the mangas there.

756
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,580
Speaker 1: And because of the anime, we were looking at mangas.

757
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:12,840
Speaker 1: And what I saw on the comic shelf, they had, you know, over by the magazine racks, not by the manga shelf, but by the magazine racks, it was Ghost in the Shell 2 number one.

758
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:18,660
Speaker 1: So I picked that up and I was actually going to Borders to buy that comic book and that comic book only.

759
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:24,680
Speaker 1: And then, uh, in our second year at RIT, my friend Ian shows up, right?

760
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:26,500
Speaker 1: Uh, cause he went to RIT also.

761
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,500
Speaker 0: Oh right, that's when you guys would go to the secret mall.

762
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,611
Speaker 0: And he said, hey, you want to go to the comic shop?

763
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,940
Speaker 1: And I'm like, yeah, I'd need the next issue of Ghost in the Shell.

764
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,600
Speaker 1: If they have it there, then, you know, I won't have to go to Borders and maybe it'll be better there.

765
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,280
Speaker 0: That was when I learned of the comic shop culture because that was the shop where, like, Luke and everybody had their account.

766
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,379
Speaker 1: Well, no, they went to a different shop than us.

767
00:35:46,982 --> 00:35:50,460
Speaker 1: They went to, uh, they went to Comic Book Heaven, which is run by an old guy.

768
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there was drama between that guy and the anime club I had to deal with.

769
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, that was a different one.

770
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:59,076
Speaker 1: That was, uh, Empire Comics.

771
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,120
Speaker 1: That was the third shop.

772
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,419
Speaker 0: I didn't know there was a third shop.

773
00:36:02,123 --> 00:36:04,940
Speaker 0: The only one I actually ever went to to buy comics was the one in Hippie Mall.

774
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,803
Speaker 1: Comics was the drama.

775
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,369
Speaker 1: Comic Book Heaven was the old guy.

776
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,500
Speaker 1: The one that I went to in the Hippie Mall was comic books, et cetera.

777
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,340
Speaker 1: Rochester had a lot of nerdy stuff because it was in Millennium Games.

778
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:14,860
Speaker 0: That Hippie Mall was pretty great.

779
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,004
Speaker 1: The Hippie Mall was pretty great.

780
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:17,710
Speaker 1: Comic, et cetera, was a pretty great shop.

781
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,560
Speaker 1: I liked the way they were organized by sort of feel, you know.

782
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:32,359
Speaker 1: And the thing is that when I went to comics, et cetera, right, I tried, I basically wanted to ignore the Marvel and the DC stuff because I didn't, you know, I was money conscious and I didn't want to get caught up in, you know, these crossovers and all that bullshit that I knew was going on.

783
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:40,840
Speaker 1: So I was, I would only buy like mini series if it was a Marvel or DC thing, you know, like I bought, uh, and I basically just looked at the shelf and picked stuff out.

784
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,780
Speaker 1: Like I read this, uh, it was a series mostly for kids, Sentinel.

785
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,852
Speaker 1: It was a self-contained series about a Sentinel.

786
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,700
Speaker 1: This kid finds a Sentinel in his backyard.

787
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:49,551
Speaker 1: It's, I still have it.

788
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:50,199
Speaker 1: It's pretty awesome.

789
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:51,096
Speaker 1: I liked it.

790
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,451
Speaker 1: There was a Voltron comic.

791
00:36:52,492 --> 00:36:53,179
Speaker 1: That was pretty good.

792
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:56,660
Speaker 1: Uh, and I was also starting to, you know, see what mangas were coming out.

793
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,234
Speaker 1: Like, you know, I bought all of Akira for the first time.

794
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:00,460
Speaker 1: I just finished buying it for the second time.

795
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,442
Speaker 0: I have a much, it's weird.

796
00:37:01,462 --> 00:37:09,940
Speaker 0: I have such an like older and spotty history of manga because anime I get into, you know, when I was eight, fourth grade, my mom made me watch vampire hunter D against my will.

797
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:14,340
Speaker 0: But around, I watched all the anime I could get forever.

798
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,908
Speaker 0: And then it wasn't until high school.

799
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:20,880
Speaker 0: Cause I knew vaguely around like my freshman year of high school that manga existed.

800
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:21,922
Speaker 0: I heard of it.

801
00:37:21,942 --> 00:37:29,280
Speaker 0: I was like, I heard that anime was all based on Japanese comics and I got really interested in that and you couldn't get it.

802
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,340
Speaker 0: It just wasn't anywhere.

803
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:38,354
Speaker 1: Well, actually the thing was is in the comic shop that I went to as a kid that didn't close yet, there was one small area that I always completely ignored.

804
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:41,340
Speaker 1: that had a whole bunch of Ranma half tapes.

805
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:51,000
Speaker 1: And probably, you know, they probably had all those like Viz manga that were in individual issues, you know, uh, and they probably had, you know, the, the, all that stuff.

806
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,600
Speaker 0: Ah, see the comic shops near me didn't have anything like that.

807
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,919
Speaker 1: And I just completely ignored it and didn't give a shit.

808
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:57,459
Speaker 0: The first manga I ever saw.

809
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,446
Speaker 1: Just like I ignored all those image comics.

810
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:03,980
Speaker 1: I basically, I was, I was really, I guess it was cause I didn't have enough money to buy all the comics.

811
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:13,340
Speaker 1: That there was just something in me that's like I, when I was a kid, I like completely ignored and like I was really judging before trying almost everything.

812
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,960
Speaker 1: Well, for me, the first.

813
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,120
Speaker 1: And if I hadn't done that, I probably would have ended up buying.

814
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:17,939
Speaker 0: I wanted manga.

815
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,000
Speaker 1: A bunch of cool stuff.

816
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,243
Speaker 0: And I would have bought it all.

817
00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:21,367
Speaker 0: It just wasn't available.

818
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:24,917
Speaker 0: And then one day I was in Florida with a marching band trip.

819
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:25,760
Speaker 0: I think it was 10th grade.

820
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:26,520
Speaker 1: And you found a manga.

821
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:31,000
Speaker 0: And we, the last day, like we're going to fly out like late in the afternoon.

822
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:34,860
Speaker 0: So we were all supposed to go into like Disney world or something or just like stay in the hotel.

823
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:38,680
Speaker 0: We totally just ran off and went like downtown and went all over the place.

824
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:43,720
Speaker 0: And eventually we ended up in the Virgin Megastore and they had a gigantic manga section.

825
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:43,981
Speaker 1: Yeah.

826
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:45,329
Speaker 1: Virgin Megastore was always weird.

827
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:47,080
Speaker 1: We went to the one in New York before it closed.

828
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:48,857
Speaker 1: Uh, at least the time square one.

829
00:38:48,877 --> 00:38:49,100
Speaker 1: Remember?

830
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:50,632
Speaker 0: And I remember I'm looking at her.

831
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:51,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do remember that.

832
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:57,860
Speaker 1: And the thing was is they had, you know, it's, they only sell, it's basically a giant FYE, but they have absolutely everything.

833
00:38:57,981 --> 00:38:59,620
Speaker 1: So they even have the manga.

834
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,600
Speaker 0: So I see the manga and I'm like, holy shit.

835
00:39:01,941 --> 00:39:05,100
Speaker 0: And my couple of friends who were in anime are like, holy shit, manga.

836
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:08,980
Speaker 0: And we're looking at it and looking at it and I didn't have much money left and they didn't have much money left.

837
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:12,234
Speaker 0: And I saw in the middle of all of it, a Tenchi manga.

838
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:13,480
Speaker 0: And I was really into Tenchi Muya.

839
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:13,895
Speaker 1: Oh, good guy.

840
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,411
Speaker 0: So I was like, fuck yeah.

841
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:16,178
Speaker 0: And I bought it.

842
00:39:16,548 --> 00:39:16,760
Speaker 1: Nice.

843
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,659
Speaker 0: It was the first manga I ever bought.

844
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,320
Speaker 0: And then I just kept reading manga from that point onward.

845
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,140
Speaker 1: Yeah.

846
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:33,940
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, anime is a sort of different, you know, I mean, I got into manga because I was in the anime club at RIT and we went to Borders and I saw manga there and I was already, I was already in the anime.

847
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,599
Speaker 1: So there you go.

848
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,899
Speaker 1: It was already super into anime.

849
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,760
Speaker 1: It went right across the table.

850
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:43,520
Speaker 0: Like anime club at RIT, my thought was, all right, I'll meet more than a handful of people who are super into anime.

851
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,840
Speaker 0: Little did I know, I thought I was hardcore until I got to RIT anime.

852
00:39:47,726 --> 00:39:49,438
Speaker 1: We weren't even hardcore when we left RIT yet.

853
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:50,012
Speaker 0: I know.

854
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:57,680
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's like I got into anime sort of like gradually, like it wasn't something that it was the forefront of my mind.

855
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:09,060
Speaker 1: It was sort of just like, you know, I mean, obviously I watched the Transformers and the Voltron as a kid, which, you know, and all those sorts of things and Thundercats and, you know, things that were sort of anime sort of weren't, you know, depending on what it was.

856
00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:12,480
Speaker 1: And then I knew animes existed and I kind of wanted to watch them.

857
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,660
Speaker 1: Like, you know, in the late 80s, like Akira was in the newspaper and I knew that it existed.

858
00:40:16,963 --> 00:40:18,439
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, I kind of want to watch that.

859
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:28,840
Speaker 1: But it wasn't actually until like Toonami when I would, you know, actually, you know, like, I mean, the local station, like syndicate Sailor Moon, but I didn't watch Sailor Moon.

860
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:31,099
Speaker 1: I was like, fuck Sailor Moon.

861
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:35,080
Speaker 0: By the time of Toonami, I already had a sizable VHS anime collection.

862
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,700
Speaker 0: I had already bought hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of fansubs.

863
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, not at all.

864
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:54,120
Speaker 0: So when, you know, Toonami rolled around, I started watching, you know, and also when Sci-Fi Channel, you know, did their thing, you know, like I spent like 400 bucks to get all of Sailor Moon because I had to get SVHS tapes and mail them to a dude.

865
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't know about fansubs existing until I got to RIT.

866
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,520
Speaker 0: And that's in fact, that's where I got End of Eva.

867
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:07,680
Speaker 0: I didn't know what Evangelion was, but I got End of Eva and I was like, hey, I got this anime movie and all my friends, we sat down and watched it.

868
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:11,080
Speaker 0: And at the end they were like, Rim, what the fuck?

869
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:13,073
Speaker 0: Yeah.

870
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:13,570
Speaker 0: Yeah.

871
00:41:13,742 --> 00:41:14,380
Speaker 0: That was great.

872
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,360
Speaker 0: Especially when later I finally like learned what Eva was and I started watching it.

873
00:41:19,882 --> 00:41:22,380
Speaker 0: And then I thought after a few episodes, like, wait a minute.

874
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:24,438
Speaker 0: I know how this ends.

875
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:27,299
Speaker 0: Oh, oh.

876
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:33,720
Speaker 0: But it's like in high school and even pretty much from fourth grade on, I was super into anime.

877
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,680
Speaker 0: Anime was my second geekery.

878
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,340
Speaker 0: The only thing more important than anime was gaming.

879
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,000
Speaker 0: So I watched all the anime I could get.

880
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,880
Speaker 0: I rented every goddamn anime from Blockbuster.

881
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,240
Speaker 0: I just constantly, me and my little brother got into it.

882
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,259
Speaker 0: I got my parents into it.

883
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:49,400
Speaker 0: I'd watch Vampire Hunter D when I was a little kid over and over and over again.

884
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,038
Speaker 0: I'd wanted to dress up as him for Halloween.

885
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:51,800
Speaker 1: Yes.

886
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:57,940
Speaker 1: You know, I slowly towards late, you know, once Toonami came out, there was slowly more animes, right?

887
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,320
Speaker 1: I would watch more on sci-fi channel.

888
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:03,080
Speaker 1: There was a week of Godzilla followed by a week of anime.

889
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,260
Speaker 1: I was watching the week of Godzilla movies and the next week just happened to be week of anime movies.

890
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,020
Speaker 1: And I watched like Galaxy Express and Fatal Fury.

891
00:42:12,724 --> 00:42:13,719
Speaker 1: Fatal Fury is not so good.

892
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:14,839
Speaker 1: It's awful.

893
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,699
Speaker 1: You know, and then I was sort of like, all right.

894
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:25,280
Speaker 1: I was sort of like, like anime was the thing I wanted, but I didn't know or care enough like to try a whole bunch to get more.

895
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,200
Speaker 1: But like I saw RIT Anime Club and I was like, oh, that's where I can get more animes.

896
00:42:29,462 --> 00:42:29,777
Speaker 1: All right.

897
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,272
Speaker 0: And we were already all through high school, our D&D group would meet every Sunday and play for like 12 hours.

898
00:42:35,062 --> 00:42:37,097
Speaker 0: Like all day, every Sunday we'd just play D&D.

899
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:37,656
Speaker 1: Yeah.

900
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,639
Speaker 1: There weren't enough nerds to play D&D by me.

901
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,760
Speaker 1: So I had to be like, you know, when I got to RIT, I was like, all right, now I can play some fucking D&D.

902
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,999
Speaker 1: Which is the only reason we're here today.

903
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:47,145
Speaker 0: At like 10 a.m.

904
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:51,040
Speaker 0: we'd all meet and go to the grocery store and buy like a hundred dollars worth of shit.

905
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,060
Speaker 0: And then we'd all converge in the basement of whoever's house.

906
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,434
Speaker 0: We like rotated around and we'd dick around and I want to do them for like a couple of hours.

907
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:02,180
Speaker 0: Then we'd play D&D forever, get food.

908
00:43:02,842 --> 00:43:05,960
Speaker 0: And then we'd watch whatever anime we were watching.

909
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:08,320
Speaker 0: And we just would get a VHS tape of every show.

910
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:10,839
Speaker 0: And we'd always say, we'll watch one episode.

911
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:12,340
Speaker 1: And we watched all the episodes.

912
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,960
Speaker 0: We'd watch every episode on the VHS tape.

913
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,118
Speaker 1: I think the only anime I watched on a VHS before RIT was a dubbed Akira.

914
00:43:20,138 --> 00:43:20,800
Speaker 1: Someone Let Me.

915
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,899
Speaker 0: I watched at least 50 anime completely on VHS before I got to RIT.

916
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:27,820
Speaker 0: Probably.

917
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,980
Speaker 0: If you count all the movies and all the OAVs individually.

918
00:43:32,107 --> 00:43:32,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

919
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:34,638
Speaker 0: A lot of it was shit.

920
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,820
Speaker 0: Like some of it was great though.

921
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,820
Speaker 0: Like Project Aco has such a, like, it's dear to me watching that stuff.

922
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,299
Speaker 1: I wonder if you hadn't seen Project Aco then and you only saw it now.

923
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:53,717
Speaker 0: I've met people who've watched it recently because we told them to in those Anime You Should See panels and they loved it.

924
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,260
Speaker 0: And I watched the first one again recently.

925
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:57,980
Speaker 0: It's goddamn hilarious.

926
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:58,998
Speaker 0: It really is.

927
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,639
Speaker 0: It holds up funnily the same way that like Mahou Tsekai Tae holds up.

928
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:04,700
Speaker 0: Like that level of comedy.

929
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,156
Speaker 0: That's fun.

930
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,357
Speaker 0: Of course I didn't know back then until recently when Gerald taught us the origin of Project Aco.

931
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:11,918
Speaker 1: Yeah.

932
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:14,218
Speaker 0: But I even had lulls.

933
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,075
Speaker 0: Like I got into anime and then I'd seen everything I could get my hands on.

934
00:44:17,115 --> 00:44:22,760
Speaker 0: so I had this lull where I didn't watch a lot of anime until I learned I could get fansubs.

935
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,880
Speaker 1: I didn't learn about fansubs until RIT and by then it was just Anime Club Library and then digital fansubs came.

936
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:30,547
Speaker 1: So it was digital fansubs.

937
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:34,513
Speaker 1: and then there was like Episode of Gatekeeper and it was like, "Oh, digital

938
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:35,239
Speaker 1: fansubs!".

939
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,980
Speaker 1: And then we're still at that point.

940
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,900
Speaker 0: See that's how anime fandom and manga fandom for me leveled up.

941
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:42,940
Speaker 0: It was from casual fan to voracious fan immediately.

942
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:46,300
Speaker 0: And then the next level up was when I realized there were fansubs.

943
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,192
Speaker 1: Yeah, but think about how I was in that late high school where I was just watching whatever was on TV.

944
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:50,917
Speaker 0: Yup.

945
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,999
Speaker 1: That's how most people are.

946
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,351
Speaker 1: Period.

947
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,919
Speaker 1: They never advanced beyond that.

948
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,660
Speaker 1: I only advanced because I actively went to RIT Anime Club.

949
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,240
Speaker 0: Now this is my problem with conventions like Otakon.

950
00:45:01,601 --> 00:45:02,460
Speaker 0: To bring it back around.

951
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,620
Speaker 0: Because you know we always complain, it's not the punk kids that bother me.

952
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,600
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, the kids can have their fun.

953
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,000
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with all that convention culture.

954
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:19,620
Speaker 0: What bothers me is that the conventions, as they are run, do not in any way gently push people toward getting more into anime.

955
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, the RIT Anime Club succeeded in leveling me up, if not for it.

956
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:33,620
Speaker 1: If I had gone to some other school, I would have pretty much just been watching anime on TV, not even realizing dubs vs subs was an issue kind of guy.

957
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,860
Speaker 0: And instead, look what happened.

958
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:35,840
Speaker 0: We did Geek Nights.

959
00:45:36,182 --> 00:45:38,900
Speaker 0: We lecture in front of thousands of anime conventions.

960
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,260
Speaker 1: Now I know more about anime than most people in this country.

961
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:48,397
Speaker 0: In fact, we were complimented by a professor who studies anime and someone who worked on Minky Momo.

962
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,280
Speaker 0: In fact, was the main person behind Minky Momo on our surprising knowledge of anime.

963
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,300
Speaker 0: I wish I could have introduced that guy to Gerald Surratt, Gerald and Clarissa.

964
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,299
Speaker 0: Or Mike Tull.

965
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we know more than most in this country.

966
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:05,020
Speaker 1: It's not saying much because there are a zillion people who know more than we do.

967
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,740
Speaker 0: Anime, we're like a B6, like Black Shade 6, I'd say.

968
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,420
Speaker 0: Gerald, they're like Gray 5.

969
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:12,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, who knows.

970
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,098
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't know.

971
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,280
Speaker 0: But anyway, I guess the conventions don't do a good job of pushing people.

972
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,600
Speaker 0: And you know why we leveled up at RIT Anime?

973
00:46:21,682 --> 00:46:22,379
Speaker 0: It was very simple.

974
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:25,020
Speaker 0: They would tell us a little bit about the show.

975
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,879
Speaker 0: They'd show us a random show and they'd be like, "Yeah, this was done by so and

976
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:28,960
Speaker 0: so.".

977
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,628
Speaker 1: They didn't do enough, though.

978
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,000
Speaker 0: No, they did the bare minimum, though.

979
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:36,300
Speaker 0: They'd make in-jokes even if you didn't get them.

980
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:41,757
Speaker 0: They'd show us the touch movie and they'd be like, "This is probably one of the most depressing things you're ever going to see outside of

981
00:46:41,858 --> 00:46:42,059
Speaker 0: EVA.".

982
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, it's like Anime World Order was the second level up, right?

983
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,579
Speaker 1: As soon as you listen to their show, it's like, "Oh, I should pay attention to who the director

984
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:49,720
Speaker 1: is.".

985
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,279
Speaker 1: And then you're fully leveled up.

986
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,629
Speaker 0: But go back to RIT Anime.

987
00:46:52,931 --> 00:46:54,080
Speaker 0: when you wanted to check out tapes.

988
00:46:54,241 --> 00:47:01,980
Speaker 0: After I'd watched every show I already knew about, I'd be looking around and one of the older guys who was running the club at the time, because we were just young punk freshmen.

989
00:47:02,944 --> 00:47:08,580
Speaker 0: We were called the Front Row Crew because we were a group of assholes who sat in the front row and heckled and made noise.

990
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,120
Speaker 0: And they thought about kicking us out of the club.

991
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:12,979
Speaker 0: And then we took the club over and ran it for many years.

992
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,399
Speaker 0: But we were just punk kids and I'd be standing there looking through the anime and I didn't recognize any of it.

993
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:22,018
Speaker 0: And the older guys would be like, "Hey, you should watch

994
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:22,260
Speaker 0: this.".

995
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,754
Speaker 0: And they'd give me K.O.

996
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,380
Speaker 0: Century Beasts.

997
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,373
Speaker 0: I'd be like, "What's it

998
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:25,599
Speaker 0: about?".

999
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,370
Speaker 0: They'd be like, "Just watch

1000
00:47:26,451 --> 00:47:26,492
Speaker 0: it.".

1001
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:27,738
Speaker 0: And I did.

1002
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:33,199
Speaker 0: And that alone got me into whole swaths of anime that I never would have seen.

1003
00:47:34,422 --> 00:47:39,020
Speaker 1: I did watch a whole bunch of stuff at RIT Anime Club that I never would have seen.

1004
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,440
Speaker 1: Like, say, Kishinkou.

1005
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:41,703
Speaker 1: Kuu.

1006
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:43,711
Speaker 1: Which I still can't find.

1007
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:44,620
Speaker 1: Kuu for the life of me.

1008
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,038
Speaker 1: If I hadn't seen it there, I never would have seen it.

1009
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,700
Speaker 1: Or Horror's Prince of Sun, right?

1010
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,579
Speaker 1: But it was like, I still didn't really fully get them until later.

1011
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,017
Speaker 0: No, Anime World Order was the next level up.

1012
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,079
Speaker 1: It wasn't until much later that I appreciated what I had seen.

1013
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:05,440
Speaker 0: I mean, I think back that I had access to all of such classics as Marmalade Boy or Kimiguri Orange Road.

1014
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:06,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

1015
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,120
Speaker 0: I mean, I watched a lot of that anime and it was because people just told me to.

1016
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,113
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Okay, I trust these people.

1017
00:48:12,153 --> 00:48:12,958
Speaker 0: They know more than I

1018
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:13,119
Speaker 0: do.".

1019
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:15,620
Speaker 0: And manga, that was the same thing.

1020
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,380
Speaker 0: Like, I was into manga, but I only read manga that I already knew.

1021
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:24,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I pretty much started out buying mangas that went along with animes that I already was watching.

1022
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,200
Speaker 1: Like, I bought the Initial D manga.

1023
00:48:26,661 --> 00:48:28,300
Speaker 1: I bought the Akira manga.

1024
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,760
Speaker 0: My level up was very specific.

1025
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,478
Speaker 0: It was Luke and Scojo.

1026
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:39,327
Speaker 0: One day we were at a convention, like an Otakon, and we were walking around and one of them said something like, "You gotta look in the dollar bins.

1027
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:41,355
Speaker 0: That's where you find the crazy stuff like

1028
00:48:41,676 --> 00:48:42,359
Speaker 0: Sanctuary.".

1029
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:43,832
Speaker 0: And I was like, "What's

1030
00:48:43,872 --> 00:48:44,559
Speaker 0: Sanctuary?".

1031
00:48:45,144 --> 00:48:47,340
Speaker 0: And I read the first volume of Sanctuary.

1032
00:48:47,982 --> 00:48:49,272
Speaker 0: And that was the moment of revelation.

1033
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,856
Speaker 0: I was like, "There's manga like

1034
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:52,038
Speaker 0: this?".

1035
00:48:55,123 --> 00:49:02,197
Speaker 1: I believe it was more something along the lines of someone was like, "Yeah, there's a manga about a yakuza and a politician and something,

1036
00:49:02,377 --> 00:49:02,779
Speaker 1: something.".

1037
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:06,200
Speaker 1: And we eventually found it, and then we were in business.

1038
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:12,260
Speaker 0: It was mostly that we were told to look in discount bins because you'll find the good stuff there.

1039
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:18,439
Speaker 0: And we were given a small list of awesome titles, which led us to other awesome titles, which eventually led us to...

1040
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they definitely led us to the eagle direction as well.

1041
00:49:21,021 --> 00:49:24,320
Speaker 0: And then eventually we started to notice who wrote things.

1042
00:49:24,981 --> 00:49:25,979
Speaker 1: That wasn't until much later.

1043
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it happened.

1044
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,299
Speaker 1: But yeah, mangas, I bought them at Borders, and I was only buying a few.

1045
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:38,060
Speaker 1: And then I started going to the comic shop, so I was seeing some more mangas at the comic shop and also media play.

1046
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:42,820
Speaker 1: But there were only so many that I was actually interested in, and I was pretty picky.

1047
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:53,340
Speaker 1: But then, finally, when I got out of RIT and I had a whole pile of money, I was going to the physical comic shop in New York City every week.

1048
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:59,180
Speaker 1: And then eventually, when I couldn't go there anymore because I moved to Beacon, I was doing a mail order from the same shop.

1049
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,264
Speaker 1: And then I said, "Wait a minute.

1050
00:50:00,284 --> 00:50:03,278
Speaker 1: If I'm mail ordering, I can mail order from this other place for half

1051
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:03,580
Speaker 1: price.".

1052
00:50:04,903 --> 00:50:07,200
Speaker 1: But because I was doing that, I was seeing the order form.

1053
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,620
Speaker 1: So I knew at that point every single manga that was coming out every single month.

1054
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,307
Speaker 1: Because a lot of people, even comic fans, right?

1055
00:50:16,482 --> 00:50:19,736
Speaker 1: They're basically the equivalent of what I was to anime in high school.

1056
00:50:19,756 --> 00:50:20,620
Speaker 1: They'll watch it on TV.

1057
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,380
Speaker 1: So these people in comics, they go to the comic shop and they look at the shelf every week, right?

1058
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,338
Speaker 1: And they just buy what they see, what they like, like I was doing at Comics Etc.

1059
00:50:29,398 --> 00:50:29,800
Speaker 1: in Rochester.

1060
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:36,940
Speaker 1: And the problem with that is that the vast majority of comic shops, like 99%, don't buy everything there is.

1061
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,778
Speaker 1: They can't afford to buy everything there is.

1062
00:50:39,322 --> 00:50:42,319
Speaker 1: So if you just look at the shelf, you won't know everything there is.

1063
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,999
Speaker 1: And the only way for you to know everything there is, is to get that stupid fucking catalog for four dollars.

1064
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:51,500
Speaker 1: Or do the online ordering with the place that gives you the spreadsheet that I get.

1065
00:50:52,421 --> 00:50:52,622
Speaker 1: Right?

1066
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:55,640
Speaker 1: Or, and even then, they'll sell you the stupid catalog.

1067
00:50:55,781 --> 00:51:00,440
Speaker 1: Or send you free copies of the stupid catalog without you asking for it and filling up your trash bin.

1068
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:04,960
Speaker 1: But once you get that, you can see everything that's coming out.

1069
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,658
Speaker 1: And you can say, "Look at all these mangas that are being printed in English that I don't even know

1070
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:09,040
Speaker 1: existed.".

1071
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,416
Speaker 1: Or, "Look at all these comics coming out from indie publishers that I don't even know

1072
00:51:12,456 --> 00:51:12,818
Speaker 1: existed.".

1073
00:51:13,564 --> 00:51:14,860
Speaker 0: Ah, the indie publishers.

1074
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:22,420
Speaker 1: And that is like the highest level that you can get, is now you see with your eyeballs every comic that is available to you.

1075
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,660
Speaker 1: And also the webcomics, don't leave out the webcomics either, right?

1076
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,542
Speaker 1: Which I started reading.

1077
00:51:26,562 --> 00:51:32,380
Speaker 1: since the year 2000, I've been reading many, many webcomics every single day.

1078
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,266
Speaker 0: It was really at RIT.

1079
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:34,676
Speaker 0: You know what got us into webcomics?

1080
00:51:34,696 --> 00:51:35,280
Speaker 0: Like, for real?

1081
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,920
Speaker 0: It was back then, Mega Tokyo and Penny Arcade.

1082
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:40,699
Speaker 0: And real life comics.

1083
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,540
Speaker 1: I gotta be perfectly honest, it was pretty much just Mega Tokyo.

1084
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:47,860
Speaker 1: Somehow I ended up at it, and I was reading it every day.

1085
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,659
Speaker 0: We all read it and talked about it.

1086
00:51:50,201 --> 00:51:51,890
Speaker 0: We were like, "Oh man, did you read Mega Tokyo?

1087
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder what's gonna happen.

1088
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:53,438
Speaker 0: Oh man,

1089
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:53,820
Speaker 0: Margo.".

1090
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:59,298
Speaker 1: And even in those earliest of days, like for a couple months, I was like, "Fuck your 8-bit theater and your Penny

1091
00:51:59,358 --> 00:51:59,699
Speaker 1: Arcade.".

1092
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was reading 8-bit theater because I found that shit hilarious.

1093
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,300
Speaker 1: But not everyone else did.

1094
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,100
Speaker 1: I was not a fan of those immediately.

1095
00:52:06,641 --> 00:52:10,300
Speaker 1: I think I was against them the same way I was against all the other comics in the comic shop.

1096
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was basically, I hit Mega Tokyo and I was like, "Oh shit!

1097
00:52:13,456 --> 00:52:14,220
Speaker 0: Webcomics!".

1098
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,619
Speaker 0: And then I read a million webcomics, realized they all sucked, parroted it down, pretty much like real life, 8-bit theater.

1099
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,138
Speaker 1: I added all these webcomics because I was like, "Webcomics are a

1100
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:23,340
Speaker 1: thing!".

1101
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,360
Speaker 1: So I started getting a whole bunch of them, and then I got rid of a bunch of them.

1102
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,920
Speaker 1: And some of them ended and some of them started.

1103
00:52:28,544 --> 00:52:28,979
Speaker 1: Do you remember?

1104
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,820
Speaker 0: 8 Bad Boys of Computer Science.

1105
00:52:31,044 --> 00:52:31,640
Speaker 0: That's right!

1106
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:35,600
Speaker 0: We gave that fucker from the Bad Boys of Computer Science money.

1107
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,000
Speaker 1: The greatest, worst webcomic in all of history.

1108
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,138
Speaker 0: It wasn't that great, but one.

1109
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:41,850
Speaker 1: Actually, it was pretty great.

1110
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,820
Speaker 1: Not you too, Tribes 2.

1111
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:49,040
Speaker 0: Other than the fact that they drank heavily, the characters, it was very similar to our experiences at RIT.

1112
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:53,359
Speaker 0: And they also were as obsessed with Tribes 2 as we were.

1113
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,584
Speaker 0: That was it.

1114
00:52:55,652 --> 00:52:56,620
Speaker 0: That's the main reason.

1115
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,675
Speaker 1: Bad Boys of Computer Science was the shit.

1116
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,951
Speaker 0: It was that, real life, 8-bit theater.

1117
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:02,320
Speaker 0: I read College Roomies from Hell.

1118
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,028
Speaker 0: So did Greg.

1119
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:03,860
Speaker 0: Almost no one else did.

1120
00:53:03,942 --> 00:53:04,419
Speaker 1: I didn't read that.

1121
00:53:05,322 --> 00:53:07,659
Speaker 0: I remember reading a lot of weird stuff, like Not Gonna Take It.

1122
00:53:08,182 --> 00:53:10,180
Speaker 0: That was done by Meredith Grin back in the day.

1123
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,957
Speaker 1: Alright, so here's the webcomics I'm reading right now.

1124
00:53:12,038 --> 00:53:12,200
Speaker 1: Ready?

1125
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,240
Speaker 1: Those are all newspaper comics that happen also on the web.

1126
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:15,325
Speaker 0: Dr.

1127
00:53:15,347 --> 00:53:15,539
Speaker 0: McGinja.

1128
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,908
Speaker 1: Alright, so real life, Penny Arcade, Dr.

1129
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:28,380
Speaker 1: McGinja, XKCD, Wondermark, Johnny Wander, Order of the Stick, Freak Angels, Gun Show, Hark of Vagrant, Axe Cop, Gastrophobia, which I talked about recently.

1130
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,660
Speaker 0: I really like Gastrophobia.

1131
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,979
Speaker 0: And do you know what has returned?

1132
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:32,060
Speaker 0: What has returned?

1133
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,260
Speaker 1: The greatest webcomic of all time.

1134
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,600
Speaker 0: The Bad Boys of Computer Science?

1135
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:36,057
Speaker 1: No.

1136
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,699
Speaker 1: The Boy on a Stick.

1137
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:38,482
Speaker 1: Oh.

1138
00:53:39,623 --> 00:53:40,056
Speaker 1: And Slither.

1139
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,459
Speaker 0: I've given up on Boases.

1140
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,739
Speaker 1: He's got a new art style too.

1141
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,259
Speaker 0: We used to be really into Boases.

1142
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,132
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's got a new art style and everything.

1143
00:53:46,635 --> 00:53:47,220
Speaker 1: It's pretty awesome.

1144
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:48,036
Speaker 1: Alright.

1145
00:53:48,581 --> 00:53:49,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, you like that?

1146
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,380
Speaker 0: But all that started from Mega Tokyo.

1147
00:53:52,561 --> 00:54:00,660
Speaker 0: So, never ever actually legitimately make fun of some kid who gets into anime from Naruto, because that's how most people get into everything.

1148
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:05,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's nothing wrong, right, with the guy who gets into something through something stupid, right?

1149
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,420
Speaker 1: Who moves on to the hardcore from a casual thing, right?

1150
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,360
Speaker 1: Everyone, even the hardest core guy, started out with something lame, right?

1151
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,780
Speaker 1: No one starts out just playing Battletech out of the womb, right?

1152
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,740
Speaker 1: They played Monopoly and then Risk and then something else, right?

1153
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,060
Speaker 1: I mean, who plays Battletech first thing?

1154
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,710
Speaker 0: I was into board games for most of my life.

1155
00:54:23,811 --> 00:54:25,280
Speaker 0: I was hardcore into Monopoly.

1156
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,120
Speaker 0: I would play full Monopoly games against myself to try and solve it.

1157
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:34,956
Speaker 1: I mean, all that time that I was buying those superhero cards and those comic books, you know what I was spending even more money on?

1158
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:36,979
Speaker 1: Magic the fucking gathering.

1159
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:43,060
Speaker 1: So, I mean, while I look down on it now, it was still, it had its purpose.

1160
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,320
Speaker 1: And the only thing you gotta look down on is not starting in these things.

1161
00:54:47,422 --> 00:54:48,079
Speaker 1: They shouldn't exist.

1162
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,440
Speaker 1: It's that failing to move on from those things.

1163
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,300
Speaker 1: If I was still playing Magic now, that would be sad.

1164
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,700
Speaker 0: I can't blame people who don't move on because they're never presented with it.

1165
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,920
Speaker 0: Because look at all the things we're into.

1166
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,000
Speaker 1: If I was still reading Mega Tokyo now, that'd be sad.

1167
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,259
Speaker 0: But at the same time, look at us.

1168
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,320
Speaker 0: Most of our leveling ups were external things.

1169
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:08,140
Speaker 0: Like, we would put in the first half of the effort, like, I'll go to RIT anime.

1170
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,519
Speaker 0: But RIT anime returned with the second half.

1171
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,180
Speaker 0: Mega Tokyo still exists.

1172
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:11,907
Speaker 0: Here's some shit.

1173
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:13,180
Speaker 0: Like, here's stuff.

1174
00:55:13,901 --> 00:55:18,580
Speaker 0: There was this kind of event that would push us to the next level at every step of the way.

1175
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:23,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, I put in one half of the effort, which was, this RIT is clearly a nerdy school.

1176
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,080
Speaker 1: It has an anime club, it has computers, I wanna go there.

1177
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,560
Speaker 1: And then I actually went to those clubs, and that was the extent of my beginning efforts.

1178
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,495
Speaker 0: So look at conventions.

1179
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,100
Speaker 1: Oh, and when I went to the RWAG, I said, I wanna play D&D and raise my hand.

1180
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,140
Speaker 1: That was the extent of my efforts.

1181
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:45,180
Speaker 0: Yup, and RWAG said, here's a guy who's smoked more weed than he should've, who's going to run one and a half awesome sessions of Dungeons & Dragons.

1182
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,139
Speaker 1: And if that guy was a horrible guy, dammit that guy.

1183
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:49,031
Speaker 0: You know what?

1184
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,080
Speaker 1: If not for that guy, we would not be here today.

1185
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,680
Speaker 0: No geek nights, no front row crew, none of this would've happened.

1186
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,879
Speaker 1: If not for that lame guy.

1187
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:03,020
Speaker 1: So it is always a lame thing that is going to get you somehow started in the awesomeness.

1188
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,160
Speaker 0: So let's end on, cause we know it's Wednesday, getting into conventions.

1189
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,859
Speaker 1: Something like X-Men TV show.

1190
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:15,920
Speaker 0: Because I just complained about how I don't think anime conventions do a good job of providing the second half of the effort to get people more into it.

1191
00:56:16,282 --> 00:56:18,960
Speaker 0: And as a result, they're kind of falling in many ways.

1192
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,500
Speaker 0: But look at a con like the Penny Arcade Expo.

1193
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,760
Speaker 0: A lot of people go there and say things like, I've never played an indie RPG, but holy shit, look at those indie RPGs.

1194
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:35,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there also are a lot of people who go to those conventions and they'll sit there and they'll just do the one thing that they want to do and that's it.

1195
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,580
Speaker 0: But they don't put forth the effort.

1196
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,079
Speaker 0: They don't put forth the first half and say, I wanna try something new.

1197
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,960
Speaker 1: The first half was coming to PAX, that was the first half.

1198
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:49,080
Speaker 0: I don't know, I feel like now you've gotta settle for the first half is expressing even the tiniest of interest in anything.

1199
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:51,520
Speaker 0: And you gotta just follow up from there.

1200
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,620
Speaker 1: I mean, how many guys go to PAX and stay in the expo hall the entirety of the time and never leave it?

1201
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:03,395
Speaker 0: I think a lot of the people I see who are playing the single player games at the conventions, it's really an issue of.

1202
00:57:03,776 --> 00:57:05,940
Speaker 0: they're not super social and they came to the con alone.

1203
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,240
Speaker 0: They don't know how to strike up a conversation.

1204
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,884
Speaker 1: Well, also think about this, right?

1205
00:57:12,004 --> 00:57:13,488
Speaker 1: If I was a little kid, right?

1206
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:18,380
Speaker 1: When you would go to Toys R Us, there would be like a Super Nintendo there with Super Metroid and you'd be like, oh motherfucker.

1207
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,420
Speaker 0: I'd be there until my parents dragged me out.

1208
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:20,981
Speaker 1: That's right.

1209
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:29,900
Speaker 1: Now, imagine if you still had that mindset and you went to PAX, you could go into the console free play, ask for all these games that your parents wouldn't buy you that you don't have.

1210
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:31,920
Speaker 1: You could check them out and just play them.

1211
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,861
Speaker 0: Yeah, but these dudes are like 30.

1212
00:57:33,861 --> 00:57:44,900
Speaker 1: I'm just saying is that, you know, that would be, you know, if you still had that mindset of stay at the Super Nintendo demo machine for three hours, then console free play at PAX is freaking amazing to you.

1213
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,720
Speaker 1: Because you could just be like, give me give me a fucking fucking Soul Calibur and you just, oh my God, I got Soul Calibur.

1214
00:57:51,842 --> 00:57:54,460
Speaker 0: So, but how did we start with all this though?

1215
00:57:55,081 --> 00:57:58,393
Speaker 0: You know, we never heard as much as I was into anime.

1216
00:57:58,834 --> 00:58:00,480
Speaker 0: I didn't even know anime conventions existed.

1217
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,740
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I sort of understood, you know, from watching TV that there was like Star Trek conventions.

1218
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:06,581
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1219
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:14,855
Speaker 0: I knew that there were two, there were three kinds of conventions, professional conventions that were boring, Star Trek conventions and gaming cons.

1220
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,880
Speaker 0: because I went to gaming cons from little kids of mine.

1221
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,080
Speaker 1: I did go to a Magic the Gathering tournament event once.

1222
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,539
Speaker 0: I went to many of those.

1223
00:58:22,681 --> 00:58:23,359
Speaker 1: Right, in middle school.

1224
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:30,256
Speaker 0: But I also went to like Michicon, just straight up, this was a con where you pay per event and I played like eight hour D&D games.

1225
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:32,440
Speaker 0: Everyone there was fat and 40.

1226
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,340
Speaker 1: I didn't know that kind of thing existed until much later.

1227
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,845
Speaker 0: I knew, but I didn't know there was anime.

1228
00:58:35,905 --> 00:58:39,700
Speaker 0: Like it never even crossed my mind that there would be an anime equivalent of those gaming cons.

1229
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,006
Speaker 1: I didn't even fully understand that there was a convention.

1230
00:58:42,026 --> 00:58:47,460
Speaker 1: Like I saw on TV there would be references to Star Trek conventions, not, you know, like in other shows that were nerdy.

1231
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,212
Speaker 1: So I was like, oh, I guess there are Star Trek things.

1232
00:58:50,413 --> 00:58:51,900
Speaker 1: I didn't like Star Trek, so I didn't care.

1233
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,422
Speaker 0: I didn't know until I went to one.

1234
00:58:53,463 --> 00:59:04,200
Speaker 0: The first Michicon I went to, I brought all my D&D books and I brought all these characters because I was like, what I have to, I think I thought I had to bring my characters and I brought all my Magic cards.

1235
00:59:06,402 --> 00:59:08,531
Speaker 0: And I look, I didn't, I was like, how do I play a game?

1236
00:59:08,571 --> 00:59:10,499
Speaker 0: And this fat guy was like, you got to go sign up.

1237
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:14,900
Speaker 0: So I go and I pay my like five bucks and I signed up for this Magic tournament that I lost.

1238
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,360
Speaker 0: And then I signed up for this eight hour long D&D game that was part of a tournament.

1239
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:24,860
Speaker 0: And this Dungeon Master dude ran this tournament D&D session where we like busted into a pyramid.

1240
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:28,572
Speaker 0: And that was like this moment of realization.

1241
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:31,260
Speaker 0: I was like, this is the awesomest thing ever.

1242
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:33,809
Speaker 0: I'm here far away from home.

1243
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:36,700
Speaker 0: It's like two in the morning, no parents.

1244
00:59:37,681 --> 00:59:38,865
Speaker 0: I'm playing D&D.

1245
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:40,711
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

1246
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:43,540
Speaker 0: And I just kept going to gaming cons.

1247
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,694
Speaker 0: And then at RIT one day someone was like, hey, you want to go to an anime convention?

1248
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:54,160
Speaker 1: Well, I mean like at RIT, they always during the announcements, they would say things about conventions, right?

1249
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,940
Speaker 0: But they would say like Otacon is coming and I'd be like, I didn't know what that was.

1250
00:59:58,522 --> 01:00:00,509
Speaker 1: They weren't exactly explicit.

1251
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:10,100
Speaker 1: Like no one ever said like there is a thing called a convention, a whole bunch of nerds get together in a hotel or convention center, you pay an admission fee and all these things are there.

1252
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,006
Speaker 0: And this might sound crazy.

1253
01:00:11,026 --> 01:00:12,958
Speaker 0: They were so unexpected that I didn't know.

1254
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,950
Speaker 0: I feel like we're going to Otacon.

1255
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:16,320
Speaker 0: And I was like, I don't even know what that is.

1256
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,879
Speaker 1: I completely glossed over what they were saying, like I didn't care and I didn't get it.

1257
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,542
Speaker 1: And they weren't.

1258
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,414
Speaker 1: so, you know, they didn't say it very well.

1259
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,920
Speaker 1: So I didn't comprehend it completely.

1260
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,800
Speaker 1: And then somehow someone was like, we're going to Ohio con, you know, do you want to go to Ohio con?

1261
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,709
Speaker 1: And I was like, and I sort of finally got it.

1262
01:00:33,749 --> 01:00:37,100
Speaker 1: Like there's going to be some sort of anime event.

1263
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,248
Speaker 0: Here's what I was told.

1264
01:00:38,328 --> 01:00:39,640
Speaker 0: I remember this pretty clearly.

1265
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:47,739
Speaker 0: I don't remember which of the upperclassmen who are now part of the front row crew told us this, but I remember because, you know, back then I didn't know them.

1266
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:52,880
Speaker 0: So they're just like faceless entities that told me stuff all the time, vaguely authoritative.

1267
01:00:53,364 --> 01:00:54,353
Speaker 1: Perhaps they were a blur?

1268
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,124
Speaker 0: There was a time.

1269
01:00:56,165 --> 01:00:56,889
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

1270
01:00:56,909 --> 01:00:58,679
Speaker 0: I forgot all about him.

1271
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:06,640
Speaker 0: Ken Hashimoto, the blur, who stole mosh mosh revolution from us, which is fine.

1272
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:07,463
Speaker 0: You're allowed to.

1273
01:01:07,623 --> 01:01:10,476
Speaker 0: Ideas are worth nothing, but took credit for it himself.

1274
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:11,480
Speaker 0: Anyway.

1275
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,698
Speaker 0: So one of those people, I mean, we used to look up to Scott Johnson as an authority figure.

1276
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:26,647
Speaker 0: So I got, I was under the impression from these people that anime conventions, Ohio con would consist of the following.

1277
01:01:27,189 --> 01:01:29,500
Speaker 0: There's tons of girls there in cosplay.

1278
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:30,423
Speaker 0: What is that?

1279
01:01:30,624 --> 01:01:31,087
Speaker 0: They're cute.

1280
01:01:32,034 --> 01:01:32,900
Speaker 0: There's gaming there.

1281
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:36,859
Speaker 0: There is a place where artists just draw anime shit and you can buy it.

1282
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:38,326
Speaker 0: And it's awesome.

1283
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,160
Speaker 0: You can buy anime shit and it's awesome.

1284
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:43,325
Speaker 0: You'll get laid.

1285
01:01:43,345 --> 01:01:45,559
Speaker 0: I was told all these things.

1286
01:01:46,563 --> 01:01:48,499
Speaker 0: Oh, and you can watch anime there.

1287
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:56,112
Speaker 1: See, I had gone to youth group conventions in high school where you were also told that you would be laid, but there was no nerdiness going on there.

1288
01:01:56,795 --> 01:01:57,720
Speaker 1: It was just awesomeness.

1289
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:58,543
Speaker 0: So what do we do?

1290
01:01:58,724 --> 01:01:59,589
Speaker 0: We're so pumped.

1291
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:04,680
Speaker 0: The whole, almost like half the front row crew, we all go to this convention in Ohio.

1292
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,918
Speaker 1: And most of what we wanted to do was play DDR.

1293
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:07,621
Speaker 0: Yep.

1294
01:02:07,681 --> 01:02:09,639
Speaker 0: So because DDR, like there were no DDR machines.

1295
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,180
Speaker 1: That was when the DDR iron was the hottest.

1296
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,490
Speaker 0: There were no DDR machines.

1297
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:14,660
Speaker 0: We were like desperate.

1298
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,246
Speaker 0: We would like freak out.

1299
01:02:16,286 --> 01:02:24,500
Speaker 0: Like I'd get, someone would IM me on aim and be like, I heard there's DDR and people would like flock to a mall to find a broken pump it up machine.

1300
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:32,559
Speaker 0: So we go to this con, we drive to goddamn motherfucking Ohio to go to Ohio con and we walk in.

1301
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:38,440
Speaker 0: And it was one of the most disappointing experiences of my entire life.

1302
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:40,891
Speaker 1: I wasn't really, I don't know.

1303
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:42,740
Speaker 1: I wasn't disappointed at the time, right?

1304
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:52,300
Speaker 1: But over time of being there, I realized that it was kind of crummy, but it was also the first anime con and there was stuff there that I had not seen.

1305
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,032
Speaker 1: It was like this small sampling.

1306
01:02:54,073 --> 01:03:01,080
Speaker 1: It was like, it was like, it was like you go there expecting a chocolate bar, like a whole Hershey bar and you get just one square of a Hershey bar.

1307
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,247
Speaker 0: But it had everything.

1308
01:03:02,267 --> 01:03:03,134
Speaker 0: Like there was an artist alley.

1309
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:03,900
Speaker 0: I'd never seen that before.

1310
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,147
Speaker 0: Dealers room, never seen that before.

1311
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,059
Speaker 0: I bought fan art and it was awesome.

1312
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,700
Speaker 1: I didn't even think I bought actually a pretty good a Unicron fan art.

1313
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bought this thing.

1314
01:03:11,764 --> 01:03:14,580
Speaker 0: It was like Vasht the Stampede and knives as punk kids.

1315
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,179
Speaker 1: I bought a volume of Trigun Dojinshi that I thought was actual Trigun manga, but wasn't.

1316
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember that.

1317
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,880
Speaker 1: I bought a Apollo World that you can zip her up into a Pokeball for a dollar.

1318
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:33,139
Speaker 0: But all is not lost because while it, you know, we say it was this worst convention, really in retrospect, it was just very poorly run.

1319
01:03:33,681 --> 01:03:34,359
Speaker 1: Really poorly run?

1320
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,220
Speaker 0: The number of anecdotes that came out of that convention was legendary.

1321
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,897
Speaker 0: That's where the Duck Hunt tournament happened.

1322
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,819
Speaker 0: That we all won.

1323
01:03:40,961 --> 01:03:42,380
Speaker 1: That's where we played Settlers and Midget Whores.

1324
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,600
Speaker 1: No exaggeration, no hyperbole whatsoever.

1325
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:49,779
Speaker 0: I can't believe, to this day I look back on that and I'm like, that's the kind of bullshit story I would make up.

1326
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,040
Speaker 0: And yet, not only did it happen, but you were there.

1327
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,560
Speaker 0: And you would call me on it if we made that shit up.

1328
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:05,260
Speaker 1: We absolutely, 100%, no exaggeration or hyperbole or lying or anything, played Settlers of Catan with a midget whore and a non-midget ugly whore.

1329
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:07,659
Speaker 0: She wasn't that ugly, she was just old.

1330
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,260
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, she wasn't a hot whore.

1331
01:04:09,301 --> 01:04:09,796
Speaker 1: She was a whore.

1332
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:10,232
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1333
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:10,998
Speaker 0: Straight up.

1334
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,900
Speaker 1: A whore and a midget whore.

1335
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,599
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the whores.

1336
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,839
Speaker 0: There were so many whores.

1337
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:19,038
Speaker 1: We're not even exact, literally whores.

1338
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:29,100
Speaker 0: And independently, cosplay girls trying to "hook up" with people but really didn't have rooms and just needed somewhere to sleep.

1339
01:04:29,905 --> 01:04:32,300
Speaker 1: Oh, and there was Stevie Beast's Catgirls.

1340
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,040
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

1341
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:38,000
Speaker 1: And there was the really tall Sailor Moon crossdress and Sailor Bubba and yeah.

1342
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:38,814
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

1343
01:04:39,763 --> 01:04:41,539
Speaker 0: But then, from there we levelled up.

1344
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,260
Speaker 0: We gave AnimeCon a second chance.

1345
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,571
Speaker 0: Someone was like, "No, we gotta go to

1346
01:04:44,713 --> 01:04:45,178
Speaker 0: Otacon.".

1347
01:04:45,805 --> 01:04:48,121
Speaker 1: And we went to Otacon 02.

1348
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:49,720
Speaker 0: And it was mind-blowing.

1349
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,280
Speaker 1: That was the real deal.

1350
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,929
Speaker 0: And I remember we got so excited because eventually we were like, "They're gonna let us be panelists.

1351
01:04:55,111 --> 01:04:56,560
Speaker 0: We're gonna be on the Anime Club Summit.

1352
01:04:56,721 --> 01:04:57,007
Speaker 0: Oh my

1353
01:04:57,088 --> 01:04:57,556
Speaker 0: god!".

1354
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:04,360
Speaker 0: And now, we basically... Well, Otacon probably won't ever let us come back.

1355
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:05,539
Speaker 1: No, but other people do.

1356
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:05,893
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1357
01:05:07,482 --> 01:05:11,819
Speaker 0: But, you know, that's how we got into doing panels and how Geek Nights kind of formed as well.

1358
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:13,579
Speaker 0: I think we've talked enough.

1359
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:14,280
Speaker 1: We've talked enough.

1360
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,380
Speaker 1: The point is, you know, we all started with stupid shit.

1361
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,920
Speaker 1: But, don't make a mistake.

1362
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:26,174
Speaker 1: A lot of people, you know, they think, "Aha, I started with something stupid and I want to introduce this person to my

1363
01:05:26,215 --> 01:05:26,658
Speaker 1: geekery.".

1364
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:28,740
Speaker 1: Don't start them off with something stupid.

1365
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:30,160
Speaker 0: Unless you're an expert.

1366
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,100
Speaker 0: Experts can start people with something stupid.

1367
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I started...

1368
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,260
Speaker 0: I mean, Fist of the North Star is stupid.

1369
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,579
Speaker 0: Don't even pretend it's not.

1370
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,300
Speaker 0: I love it, but it is stupid.

1371
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:46,240
Speaker 1: It's like the first anime I ever saw was a bad dub of some piece of crap on, like, you know, Project Aco.

1372
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,291
Speaker 1: Well, what happens?

1373
01:05:47,332 --> 01:05:47,960
Speaker 0: Here's the failing.

1374
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,019
Speaker 0: One, the dub's not that bad.

1375
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but I'm saying, you know, that doesn't mean that you should start your friend off on Project Aco.

1376
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,620
Speaker 0: Well, here's why I'm saying experts.

1377
01:05:54,660 --> 01:06:01,840
Speaker 0: Only pros can get away with that, because it wasn't the crappy fan sub of Aco that was the moment.

1378
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,460
Speaker 0: Like, that wasn't good in and of itself.

1379
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,140
Speaker 0: You have to recreate the whole experience.

1380
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:17,600
Speaker 0: Like, a lot of the crappy anime that I watched early on, the reason it worked and made me more interested in anime is because I watched it late at night after playing D&D in a dark basement with a bunch of my nerd friends.

1381
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:19,335
Speaker 1: And also because it was rare.

1382
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was weird.

1383
01:06:21,122 --> 01:06:22,180
Speaker 1: It was no other way to get it.

1384
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,260
Speaker 1: Weird, different, and difficult to obtain.

1385
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:31,258
Speaker 0: So unless you can replicate all those factors, showing someone the crappy fan sub, anime that itself is crap objectively, it's not going to work.

1386
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,560
Speaker 0: So unless you're a pro, show them Cowboy Bebop.

1387
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,159
Speaker 1: That's right.

1388
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,500
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1389
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:47,600
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1390
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000

1391
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,960
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1392
01:06:56,101 --> 01:07:00,679
Speaker 0: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1395
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,660
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1396
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:32,708
Speaker 0: Or a road to Godoji.
