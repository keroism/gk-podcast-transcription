00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:17,669
Speaker 1: We talk about board games Verator Helles and Tower of Babel.

3
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,856
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,010
Speaker 0: So you ever gone to a hibachi?

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,310
Speaker 1: Well, of course, you've gotten hibachi and I'm considering that the hibachi down the street knows us.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know people who listening might not have ever gone to one.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,868
Speaker 0: But basically this guy cooks food right in front of you in a flat hot thing.

8
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:34,390
Speaker 1: really fun.

9
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:37,165
Speaker 1: He bounces an egg around he sets things on fire.

10
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:39,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's fun It's good Japanese food, too.

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:52,868
Speaker 0: But basically you look at he makes chicken if you order it of course and all he really does is put the chicken on a flat hot piece of metal and Then it tastes good real good better than any chicken I've ever made in my life.

12
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:59,183
Speaker 1: now I submit to you that the chicken you made for dinner tonight Did not taste like the chicken that that guy makes.

13
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:03,070
Speaker 0: no not so much But all I did was put chicken in a hot piece of metal.

14
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:05,656
Speaker 0: What the hell is he doing then?

15
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:09,248
Speaker 0: he's doing less than what I did and somehow it tastes better.

16
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:09,729
Speaker 0: what the hell.

17
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:15,086
Speaker 1: We love stir-fry and it looks so easy and we've never made a good stir-fry.

18
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:16,310
Speaker 0: No, we said never.

19
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:25,264
Speaker 1: No, the meats always stringy and tough and gangly and gristly Undercooked possibly cook the vegetables are burned the vegetables aren't cooked.

20
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:26,870
Speaker 0: What the hell what the hell is that guy doing?

21
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,729
Speaker 1: Hi, how you doing that?

22
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:31,689
Speaker 0: It just sucks.

23
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:34,734
Speaker 0: See, it's so.

24
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:35,377
Speaker 0: it's like any.

25
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,222
Speaker 0: I can cook something out of a cookbook and it can taste okay, especially if it's something that involves like sauces.

26
00:01:41,323 --> 00:01:45,817
Speaker 0: cuz sauces cover up anything but You know the actual that kind of stuff.

27
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:47,061
Speaker 0: I just don't understand it.

28
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:47,864
Speaker 0: What the hell do you?

29
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:48,647
Speaker 0: what the hell's he doing?

30
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:58,052
Speaker 0: Yeah Maybe it takes years of training or you know chef school maybe but if I learned it we'd be eating some good food Cuz.

31
00:01:58,092 --> 00:01:59,216
Speaker 0: I mean I wouldn't need much.

32
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:03,557
Speaker 0: all I need to do is throw meat onto a hot thing and we'd be eating like Kings,

33
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:10,511
Speaker 1: yeah All I know is that this morning or I was on the phone with someone in the morning while you were getting up for work I

34
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,776
Speaker 0: thought you were and

35
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,623
Speaker 1: I thought it was funny that you came home.

36
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:19,142
Speaker 1: you you mentioned to me that Apparently I talk in my sleep and I do so really clearly.

37
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:23,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, uh rims talking to sleep But the holy well, he said words real words.

38
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:24,399
Speaker 0: What the hell?

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,041
Speaker 1: Yeah.

40
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:25,603
Speaker 1: Yeah.

41
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:27,610
Speaker 0: I was on the phone at 630 in the morning.

42
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:40,724
Speaker 0: Yep, it's kind of weird And Usually people only talk in the phone that more early in the morning if they're like Night watchmen or is an emergency or who knows night watchmen.

43
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,490
Speaker 1: That's the example you come up with.

44
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:44,827
Speaker 0: That's the only people I could think of that work at night.

45
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:52,364
Speaker 1: What about people, you know, there are people who get up well before 630 Don't talk on the phone until like 7 or 8 depends depends.

46
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:53,830
Speaker 1: What if they're an important businessman?

47
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:58,110
Speaker 0: The other important businessmen are still sleeping now those loser businessmen.

48
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:09,856
Speaker 1: Well, they might be calling other loser businessmen, yeah so, uh Podcasts are doing real well, but apparently radio not so much duh.

49
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,579
Speaker 0: Oh, wait newsflash CDs not selling.

50
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:17,198
Speaker 1: Well, I Think every downloads doing great understatement of the day.

51
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:23,254
Speaker 1: here the quote from the article radio has to reinvent itself Mmm-hmm.

52
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:29,930
Speaker 1: I mean, I gotta say my car is not the best car and the the CD player's lens gets fogged up.

53
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:38,462
Speaker 1: so whenever it's cold or rainy, I can't listen to CDs and I'm stuck listening to the radio and Honestly more than half the time rather than listen to the radio.

54
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:40,450
Speaker 1: I just turn the damn thing off and don't listen to anything.

55
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:42,157
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna buy a new.

56
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,130
Speaker 0: I trip soon and we'll be cranking up the iPod in a car.

57
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's actually better than the previous one.

58
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,650
Speaker 0: So I don't feel so bad about losing the old one.

59
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,410
Speaker 1: I mean, there's just nothing on the radio.

60
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:54,650
Speaker 0: Nothing on the radio.

61
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,998
Speaker 0: That was a good song.

62
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,928
Speaker 1: I mean I flipped through this area.

63
00:03:59,008 --> 00:03:59,290
Speaker 1: anything.

64
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,870
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a lot of punk kids around here and pretty much it's our rap station at stations in Spanish.

65
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:07,922
Speaker 1: God people more God people country country.

66
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:09,489
Speaker 1: God people country God people country.

67
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:12,627
Speaker 0: They'd be like one rock station, but it plays the same ten songs.

68
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:19,427
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I heard the Led Zeppelin song that I like and then I hear this that song every day and then I give up Same songs every day.

69
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,514
Speaker 1: More ads than music.

70
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,262
Speaker 0: Yeah more as the music will do it to you every time.

71
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:31,300
Speaker 1: not only more ads but really piss poor ads Because the radio only gets local ads.

72
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,230
Speaker 0: it doesn't get like national big ads.

73
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:38,704
Speaker 0: So it's always like some poorly produced like hack job at a local car dealership or something.

74
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:46,350
Speaker 0: It's just annoying as hell with some Stupid jingle that you just want to kill God.

75
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,948
Speaker 0: Who makes these things?

76
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:51,357
Speaker 1: People who probably make more money than us.

77
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:54,306
Speaker 0: if you want a car dealership you sure as hell make more money than we do.

78
00:04:54,727 --> 00:05:01,225
Speaker 1: Yep Though, uh, I mean radio is free and it's doing poorly and yet serious.

79
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:02,930
Speaker 1: next M gangbusters.

80
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:06,639
Speaker 0: They're not doing that much gangbusters compared to radio.

81
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:10,110
Speaker 0: They are yeah, but don't expect that to last too long.

82
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:13,024
Speaker 1: Well, actually that's what the CEO of clear channel says.

83
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:14,150
Speaker 1: he's not worried.

84
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:14,792
Speaker 1: I mean hit.

85
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:19,189
Speaker 1: the quote here from him is why would you pay for something you can get for free?

86
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's exactly why we're gonna do podcasting and not listen to clear channel or serious or exit.

87
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,116
Speaker 1: Yeah Though I mean that analogy.

88
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:29,079
Speaker 1: I mean you can pay.

89
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,830
Speaker 1: you can get food for free if you go through enough dumpsters.

90
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:34,510
Speaker 1: There's a reason you pay the dollar to buy some ramen.

91
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:41,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's cuz the ramen tastes a little bit worse but is a little bit less disease in it.

92
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:50,509
Speaker 1: Hey, don't be knocking my kitsune ramen You know, it comes with the freeze-dried bean curd, I like bean curd, I don't like freeze-dried bean curd.

93
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:52,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are you gonna get for a dollar?

94
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:55,748
Speaker 0: Four packs of bubble gum.

95
00:05:57,552 --> 00:06:04,450
Speaker 1: so it seems that I mean radio is on the downturn but Inversely, the podcasts are on the upturn.

96
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,073
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just said that.

97
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:11,979
Speaker 0: yeah, but we're not the only one saying that now Apparently, I think people said it before we said it.

98
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,724
Speaker 1: podcast is this year's Word of the year from the new Oxford American dictionary.

99
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,290
Speaker 0: There's an Oxford American dictionary.

100
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:22,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait, but we've been looking in the Oxford English dictionary.

101
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:29,585
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we should have been looking in the Oxford American dictionary because that one is our language.

102
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:31,430
Speaker 1: you realize this only applies to Scrabble.

103
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:38,663
Speaker 1: Really Our use of dictionaries, where's the last time you used a dictionary that didn't involve Scrabble?

104
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:40,912
Speaker 0: doesn't argue about when a word is real or Not.

105
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:43,469
Speaker 1: yeah, and you go to dictionary or how a word is pronounced.

106
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:45,461
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't know how to pronounce things.

107
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:50,637
Speaker 1: You don't know how to pronounce things solder And I use a soldering iron.

108
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:53,446
Speaker 0: Let's go look in the Oxford English dictionary and see what it says.

109
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,510
Speaker 1: How do you pronounce solder?

110
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:56,957
Speaker 0: solder Titan.

111
00:06:56,998 --> 00:07:02,782
Speaker 0: you know that the Greek tall guys is a difference between the Greek tall guys.

112
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:04,267
Speaker 0: They don't exist Titan.

113
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:05,310
Speaker 0: They're not real.

114
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:06,092
Speaker 1: What do you?

115
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:06,654
Speaker 1: how do you say it?

116
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:07,677
Speaker 0: Titan?

117
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:11,930
Speaker 0: Titan like the Titanic or Titan only without the a depending on how Midwestern you are?

118
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:19,650
Speaker 1: Anyway, but they pick a word of the year every year and the the runners-up this year were bird flu.

119
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:21,120
Speaker 0: That's not a word.

120
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,108
Speaker 0: It's two words.

121
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:22,430
Speaker 0: hack.

122
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:29,442
Speaker 0: Life has one word that's not Persistent vegetative states, I guess this cuz the stupid.

123
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:30,647
Speaker 0: that's not a word though.

124
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:31,550
Speaker 0: That's a phrase.

125
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, oh, here's one squick.

126
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:38,390
Speaker 1: What the hell's quick cause immediate and thorough revulsion?

127
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:40,381
Speaker 1: I don't know never heard of it.

128
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,750
Speaker 1: not what I think of when I hear the word square.

129
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,072
Speaker 0: It's not.

130
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:42,917
Speaker 0: it shouldn't even be a word.

131
00:07:42,977 --> 00:07:44,124
Speaker 0: No one uses it at least no one.

132
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:46,033
Speaker 0: I know yeah Maybe it's a British thing.

133
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:49,945
Speaker 1: so I guess podcast has the dubious honor of beating those other words.

134
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:51,570
Speaker 0: last year the word of the year was blog.

135
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:53,777

Speaker 0: you know what.

137
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:59,444
Speaker 0: if I can figure out the word of the year for next year I'll be loaded cuz the guy who thought of blogs loaded guy.

138
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:03,365

00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:49,590
Speaker 0: no But she watches anything having to do with police detectives or lawyers all day.

154
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:53,201
Speaker 0: That's the only thing she watches on TV police detectives and lawyers.

155
00:08:53,602 --> 00:09:03,610
Speaker 1: I wonder what this is gonna do to the whole TV model Especially if they notice that people are willing to pay to get little TV shows without commercials on a tiny tiny screen.

156
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:10,618
Speaker 0: well, what's probably gonna happen is TV will die and They'll keep selling all their old TV shows.

157
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:14,950
Speaker 0: for you know a few bucks per episode to download on the internet.

158
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:22,200
Speaker 0: Probably DVD sales of TV shows will probably go away because people only get the episodes they want instead of paying out the ass for a giant box set.

159
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:26,109
Speaker 0: yeah, and We'll all be good as long as there's no DRM.

160
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,840
Speaker 0: DRM as long as you know DRM is will buy into it.

161
00:09:31,382 --> 00:09:32,907
Speaker 0: I would if there was no DRM.

162
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:33,730
Speaker 0: I would totally get it.

163
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:35,740
Speaker 1: Yeah depends on the price.

164
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:37,230
Speaker 0: definitely depends on the price.

165
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,450
Speaker 0: I mean apparently most of these people are doing the two bucks an episode.

166
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:51,271
Speaker 0: It's not too bad But I think people were talking like the Conan O'Brien stuff is like mispriced or like they set the prices on that to like be ridiculously stupid or something and I Can.

167
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:56,550
Speaker 0: I can guarantee you the sales that are gonna be less than everything else because of that and they'll learn their lesson.

168
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:59,262
Speaker 1: I guess two bucks seems fair, but I'm still a.

169
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:00,850
Speaker 1: 99 cent seems like a lot for a song.

170
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:05,181
Speaker 0: Yeah, what I'm hoping for actually is the only thing I really missed from TV.

171
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:08,449
Speaker 0: besides like you know a few shows.

172
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:11,668
Speaker 1: sports Yeah, sports pretty much just hockey and f1.

173
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:22,580
Speaker 0: Yeah if someone could tell me that like I can download like all the Rangers games for a hundred bucks a year with no Commercials and no annoying talking guys.

174
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,669
Speaker 0: or I can select the talking guys that I like.

175
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:28,550
Speaker 1: yeah I mean, I don't even need to see the game live because I can find out who won on the internet.

176
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:38,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, or I can download Say every f1 race of the year in full video with no commercials and select the guys I want to talk or you know have no guys talking.

177
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:41,509
Speaker 1: well apparently we can download that a moto across.

178
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,360
Speaker 0: well It's moto GP is is the?

179
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,150
Speaker 0: it's like the Formula One of motorcycles.

180
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:47,966
Speaker 0: They're 500 CC bikes, and they could go 200 miles an hour.

181
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:49,894
Speaker 0: They don't they don't.

182
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:54,390
Speaker 0: well they could mechanically, but the people who ride them don't push them that fast cuz they'll die.

183
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:55,637
Speaker 1: I need 500 CC.

184
00:10:55,677 --> 00:11:04,663
Speaker 0: my Mario Kart goes 150 CC right there Anyway but you know and they drive on the sum of the same courses that f1 drives on.

185
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:11,690
Speaker 0: so it's like the f1 of motorcycles and For them if you pay some I think it's like 50 bucks a year something like that.

186
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,757
Speaker 0: You can watch every race on the computer.

187
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:18,569
Speaker 0: if they don't have it on TV where you live or you know if you just want To save them and watch them later.

188
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:23,268
Speaker 0: You know rewind fast-forward no commercials, and it's really helping them out.

189
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:26,610
Speaker 0: in fact I'd never even cared about Michael motorcycle racing.

190
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,170
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna go to their website and watch a race and see if it's entertaining to watch.

191
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:31,330
Speaker 1: I got to say I'm curious.

192
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:37,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely especially if this bikes going over 100 miles an hour with a guy hold on freaking dear life.

193
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:38,746
Speaker 0: That's got to be freaking good shit.

194
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:48,770
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things like that that I'm interested in but there's really no way to enjoy them or to Watch them without paying out the ass, and I'm not willing to do that.

195
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I like rally racing and I like f1.

196
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:53,068
Speaker 1: I can't see it.

197
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:57,930
Speaker 1: nope I can get like stupid clips of idiots crashing their cars trying to do like super drifto.

198
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:04,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard the ESPN was talking with the iTunes music store And you know maybe they're gonna do some stuff like you know.

199
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:06,330
Speaker 0: maybe Sports Center or something.

200
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:13,050
Speaker 0: I would pay 50 bucks a year to have Sports Center automatically downloaded to my computer every day with no ads with no ads.

201
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,456
Speaker 1: Yes, no ads is key.

202
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:15,701
Speaker 0: No ads and no DRM.

203
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,030
Speaker 0: I would pay 50 bucks a year for Sports Center.

204
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:25,558
Speaker 0: I think they're gonna charge you two dollars an episode for Sports Center in which case there's no way, but Yeah, plus uh iTunes doesn't run in Linux.

205
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,166
Speaker 1: Yep, and I don't have Windows anymore.

206
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:29,470
Speaker 0: I mean think about this.

207
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:38,668
Speaker 0: this is gonna be big money because Most people I mean I could get ESPN as part of a cable package right for 50 bucks a month.

208
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,441
Speaker 0: Right 50 bucks a year for just one show.

209
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,710
Speaker 0: think about how many shows I get for 50 a month.

210
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:48,002
Speaker 0: I'm willing to pay 50 a year for one show.

211
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:52,015
Speaker 0: if you give me five shows That's 250 bucks.

212
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:54,442
Speaker 0: the cable companies are cut out of the loop.

213
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:57,170
Speaker 0: the guys making the actual content.

214
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:58,910
Speaker 0: Fuck their ad dollars.

215
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,149
Speaker 0: They're getting so many dollars and people like me buying the show for a year.

216
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,122
Speaker 0: They get rid of all the shows that nobody watches see.

217
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:06,266
Speaker 1: part of the problem.

218
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:07,190
Speaker 1: is that be great?

219
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:08,334
Speaker 1: I saw a statistic.

220
00:13:08,374 --> 00:13:12,007
Speaker 1: It was kind of scary, and I can't verify this at all because I don't really care.

221
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:20,290
Speaker 1: But they were saying that on many networks modern new TV shows are pushing the 17 minute mark in terms of content versus ads.

222
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:24,416
Speaker 0: awesome 17 minutes of show you know.

223
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:31,710
Speaker 0: actually that's not so bad because if they cut the ads out right I Don't want to watch a show for like a freaking hour.

224
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:35,810
Speaker 0: I want to watch like a 10-minute show if it you know especially if it's something like Sports Center.

225
00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:39,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to sit there for an hour Watching sports news.

226
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,730
Speaker 0: I don't have time for that shit.

227
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,217
Speaker 0: well I point I want to do is I want to?

228
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:46,982
Speaker 0: I want to sit on the train and go push a button and get all The sports news and maybe 10 15 minutes.

229
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:50,767
Speaker 0: see the awesome clips You know and have someone tell me what happened, and I'm done.

230
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:55,110
Speaker 1: well I point out the addictive power of our day killer tapes mmm the day.

231
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:56,329
Speaker 1: Can we have these day killers?

232
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:03,870
Speaker 1: Basically when I was young my family taped everything off a TV And we taped it in such a way that there are no openers closers or advertisements.

233
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:12,437
Speaker 1: So I have eight hour tapes of just you know Simpsons Simpsons episodes running into each other constantly until the tape runs out Seinfeld all that stuff.

234
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:18,442
Speaker 1: and in college if one of us put that tape in They were shot, and we'd pretty much just sit there until the tape ended.

235
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:20,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how that stuff goes.

236
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:26,130
Speaker 1: So I could see someone downloading episodes or something one by one and just getting hooked and just buying the whole thing.

237
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:32,794
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I'm looking more to add to my podcasting stuff because what I do now is because The podcast.

238
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:36,489
Speaker 0: that the reason I like the podcast because I can listen to them and work at the same time.

239
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:43,250
Speaker 0: Because you know if it's not on my screen I can have work on the screen and work doesn't go on my ear because I'm not an audio worker.

240
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:44,789
Speaker 0: So it's good.

241
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,030
Speaker 0: But if I had video I could watch it on the train.

242
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:54,188
Speaker 0: I try not to listen to podcast any other time because then I think oh I could listen to it at work But I can't do anything else.

243
00:14:55,291 --> 00:15:03,189
Speaker 0: So if I could get like a couple shows maybe like a half out an hour of shows worth a day Or maybe an hour and a half of shows a day.

244
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:07,205
Speaker 0: I could watch those on the train to and from work, and I'd be all set.

245
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,409
Speaker 0: you know be perfect You know.

246
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:11,237
Speaker 0: But right now.

247
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:12,504
Speaker 0: I can't get that for a price.

248
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,415
Speaker 0: I'm willing to pay in a format I like well.

249
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,252
Speaker 1: plus you don't seem to have enough time to even play all the video games We've got.

250
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:18,838
Speaker 0: I'm playing Mario and Luigi.

251
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:19,420
Speaker 0: I'll finish it.

252
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:20,444
Speaker 1: Yeah bit by bit.

253
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:21,930
Speaker 1: You're slacking off in the Mario car.

254
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,479
Speaker 0: You're slacking off big time more than me.

255
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:26,005
Speaker 1: I'm playing my Mario Kart.

256
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:30,417
Speaker 0: I beat my Mario Kart All right anyway.

257
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:35,569
Speaker 0: speaking of them video games a claim a claim who went out of business a long time ago.

258
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:39,329
Speaker 0: Someone's auctioning off the publishing rights to all their games.

259
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:45,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, now we're not sure if this is the like rights to the name or just the rights to that one specific.

260
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, it says publishing rights now.

261
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:49,704
Speaker 0: I'm sure that if you buy the publishing rights.

262
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:50,807
Speaker 0: Let's see something on the list.

263
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:51,470
Speaker 0: That's obvious.

264
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,218
Speaker 0: Here we go fantastic.

265
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:58,776
Speaker 0: for if you buy the publishing rights to Fantastic Four Somehow I don't.

266
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:01,489
Speaker 0: this is the video game from August 97 by the way.

267
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:05,669
Speaker 0: yeah I don't think this gives you the right to like go publishing Fantastic Four comic books and things.

268
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,219
Speaker 0: yeah Make no new Fantastic Four thing.

269
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:13,742
Speaker 1: I could see being feasible would be if say you got the right to make another Fantastic Four game or modify the game you just bought.

270
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:16,375
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can modify the game We just bought all right.

271
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:19,550
Speaker 1: what if I modified it to the extent that it's now 3d and runs on the Xbox?

272
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:20,494
Speaker 0: I don't know.

273
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:22,141
Speaker 1: see that's the problem.

274
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:23,789
Speaker 1: We're seriously gonna call them and find out.

275
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:30,230
Speaker 0: yeah I'm gonna call these guys tomorrow because there's some games on this list that are worth owning I mean, and they have no bids like we could just buy them for five bucks.

276
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:30,694
Speaker 0: I don't know.

277
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:32,530
Speaker 0: if we could buy them for five bucks there might be a minimum.

278
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,670
Speaker 0: They're willing to accept, but I'm surprised that Mortal Kombat's 1 & 2 don't have any bids.

279
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:38,174
Speaker 0: I mean alone.

280
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:48,110
Speaker 0: if I bought Mortal Kombat the the rights to publish Mortal Kombat 1 & 2 right let's say the only right I got was that I could publish and sell these games in their current state ROMs for a buck.

281
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:55,475
Speaker 0: I could sell ROMs of Mortal Kombat 1 & 2 for a buck and go around suing people who are distributing ROMs of it I'm suing.

282
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:59,590
Speaker 0: I could make back my $1,000 investment on those rights so fast.

283
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:03,962
Speaker 0: It would be totally worth it, but some of these other games not so much worth it.

284
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,608
Speaker 0: I mean who wants to buy the rights to?

285
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:14,094
Speaker 0: Let's see let's find a real bad one Real bad one.

286
00:17:14,273 --> 00:17:18,970
Speaker 1: I can think of super high impact from October 93. super high impact sounds cool.

287
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,317
Speaker 1: You know I got objects hitting things.

288
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:23,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you buy the rights to publish that game You're not gonna make so much money.

289
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,624
Speaker 1: kind of game is it?

290
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:25,430
Speaker 0: I have no clue.

291
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,750
Speaker 0: It doesn't say it's just a list of numbers names and dates and years.

292
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:29,153
Speaker 0: It's it.

293
00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:30,869
Speaker 1: how do you know that isn't some awesome game?

294
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,983
Speaker 0: I don't but I imagine it's it's really old and I've never heard of it.

295
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,284
Speaker 1: see they're not selling the rights to like that Pac-man world game.

296
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:45,930
Speaker 0: I Don't think it's an acclaimed game is yeah I think Namco owns the rights to all the Pac-man games because you know they invented Pac-man.

297
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:48,002
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd have still the worst game ever made.

298
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:50,949
Speaker 0: you'd have to name an acclaimed game anyway.

299
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:54,038
Speaker 0: All right, you you fuckers.

300
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:55,503
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't like our music.

301
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:56,166
Speaker 0: fine.

302
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:56,869
Speaker 0: You won't get any.

303
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,829
Speaker 0: yeah You'll get something annoying instead.

304
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.

305
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:11,154
Speaker 1: We're.

306
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:18,382
Speaker 1: I mean we're glad that you guys were very honest and didn't say like oh, it's okay If something sucks tell us it sucks, and we'll fix it like right away.

307
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:20,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we're playing it right now.

308
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,748
Speaker 0: We'll still be bastards to you.

309
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:29,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll be bastards, but actually we came up with a good idea this as soon as I get a chance I'm gonna sit down with my piano and make some short little like piano riffs.

310
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:30,609
Speaker 1: That'll go before all the bits.

311
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:33,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a chime or a jingle.

312
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:38,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, or like Yeah, yeah something like that something like that.

313
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:42,037
Speaker 0: Anyway, what's your thing?

314
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:43,281
Speaker 1: Oh my thing?

315
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:43,783
Speaker 0: Yep?

316
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:45,789
Speaker 1: It's not a new thing, but it's new to me.

317
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:48,038
Speaker 1: It's kinda and I heard about it.

318
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:51,050
Speaker 1: I forgot about it, but I wanted to talk about it, then I forgot about it again.

319
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:52,518
Speaker 0: Alright, alright get to it.

320
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:52,941
Speaker 1: Yeah.

321
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:57,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but uh Remember doom and doom - no I forgot what the hell those?

322
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,590
Speaker 1: yeah, well you can play them online now.

323
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:02,175
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could have played them online before.

324
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:05,727
Speaker 1: you can play them online easily with other people over the internet and not.

325
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:08,628
Speaker 1: you know IPX network serial modem style.

326
00:19:10,097 --> 00:19:13,820
Speaker 0: I could do that before It just you know with the Kali.

327
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:16,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kali Kali still around.

328
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,656
Speaker 0: I Don't know I had it.

329
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:21,148
Speaker 0: I bought it for 20 bucks for life, so I still own it.

330
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,256
Speaker 1: technically I don't think Kali still exists.

331
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:28,666
Speaker 0: it kind of stopped working after like a couple years of it being awesome And yeah using it.

332
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:38,267
Speaker 1: But this is basically just doom and doom - online now in a little account based thing kind of like steam only not big and bloated And you can just play doing with people.

333
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:46,800
Speaker 1: And I think I'm gonna get on board this if I can because uh as many people are aware I am the greatest doom player there ever was.

334
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:47,062
Speaker 1: well.

335
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:48,949
Speaker 0: We'll soon find that out won't we will uh?

336
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:55,189
Speaker 0: Hallo my name into the heavens until Maybe you'll just get a face full of rockets and plasma.

337
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,835
Speaker 0: You know shot a hot plasma.

338
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,841
Speaker 1: See uh I don't use rocket launchers.

339
00:20:00,322 --> 00:20:01,204
Speaker 1: I feel they're too easy.

340
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:05,919
Speaker 1: I Use solely the regular shotgun in the plasma gun.

341
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,064
Speaker 1: I'll use no other weapon.

342
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:08,790
Speaker 0: yeah, we'll see what happens.

343
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:10,045
Speaker 0: And you like you know get.

344
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:15,348
Speaker 1: yeah I will see if I actually get to play because windows only and wine doesn't always like things like this.

345
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,326
Speaker 0: anyway My thing of the day is this cool board game here.

346
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:24,470
Speaker 0: now You've played those things online where it's like there's a laser, and you have to rotate things to get the laser.

347
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:26,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know it.

348
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,575
Speaker 0: There's like they simulate a laser beam and you have to move things to reflect it to go in a certain path And then you solve the puzzle.

349
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:34,950
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah, well someone made a board game called deflection.

350
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:37,273
Speaker 1: Is there a K in there?

351
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:37,333
Speaker 1: No

352
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:58,906
Speaker 0: it's D E F L E X I O N ah D E F L E X I O N dot biz and it's a board game where you have an actual laser an Actual mirrors and a grid with like little triangle prism pieces and stuff and you move things around Trying to get the laser to reflect in the way you want.

353
00:20:59,207 --> 00:20:59,950
Speaker 1: that sounds fun.

354
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,157
Speaker 1: It's not a set of rules, but it sounds fun.

355
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:14,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is gimmicky, but it's like think it's like a competitive Turn-based puzzle game of moving things in a tile grid But they have mirrors on them and some of them don't have mirrors on.

356
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,310
Speaker 0: they just block the laser.

357
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:18,950
Speaker 0: Huh, so it looks pretty cool like it could be fun.

358
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,384
Speaker 0: I don't know what the rules are and I don't know how much it is.

359
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:24,002
Speaker 1: if I want to pay for it I will find out on board game geek.

360
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:27,546
Speaker 0: Yeah Probably if it ends up there, which it?

361
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:32,489
Speaker 1: yeah Though that segues nicely since you guys seem to want segues into our main bit.

362
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:39,946
Speaker 0: segue and whoever spelled it S-e-g-w-a-y that means the little two-wheeled thing that you ride on.

363
00:21:40,388 --> 00:21:47,750
Speaker 0: segue Yeah segue that Transitions from one topic of discussion to another.

364
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:50,956
Speaker 0: That's segue Yeah.

365
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:58,290
Speaker 1: Anyway, so it's board game day and we've got the good the bad and the mediocre.

366
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:05,240
Speaker 1: Though starting with the good that game verator better a Verator.

367
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:07,918
Speaker 0: in German it means Traitor.

368
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,883
Speaker 1: it's pretty cool.

369
00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:09,990
Speaker 0: It's very cool.

370
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:14,627
Speaker 1: We only played it once and we played it three player which I contend three player is broken.

371
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:15,965
Speaker 1: Scott disagrees We're not sure.

372
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:18,162
Speaker 0: yet I'm pretty sure the three player is not broken.

373
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:23,650
Speaker 0: because look if you're in third place Right, what you do is you team up with the second place guy, right?

374
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,196
Speaker 0: So both of you are getting.

375
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:29,367
Speaker 0: the second and third place guys will continue to get points Hopefully because they'll win.

376
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,422
Speaker 0: Theoretically if it's a team of two against one you'll win.

377
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:33,910
Speaker 0: if you're not gonna win then you lose.

378
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:38,410
Speaker 0: Anyway, the other guy beat you and the first place guy will keep not getting points.

379
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:45,390
Speaker 0: Then as soon as you're you know, the second place guy overtakes, you know and becomes the first place guy.

380
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:48,881
Speaker 0: you pick the verator and you now you're again.

381
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:52,992
Speaker 0: you're with the former first place guy and now.

382
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:59,835
Speaker 0: so basically you got points because you were with the winner and you switch and now your points with the winner again and See except the problem with that.

383
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:00,377
Speaker 1: Is that one?

384
00:23:00,658 --> 00:23:02,565
Speaker 1: every fight is always two verse one.

385
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:04,999
Speaker 1: unless it's everyone There's no one which is dumb.

386
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:11,363
Speaker 0: It could be three verse one In a three-player game no, it's always - alright could be three verse zero.

387
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:13,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, three verse zero doesn't have any effect on the game really.

388
00:23:15,112 --> 00:23:20,178
Speaker 0: The problem yeah, but what you could do is if you're ahead and you're in first place You want to make it three versus.

389
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,549
Speaker 1: that's the problem in in the three-player game.

390
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:27,773
Speaker 1: basically, whoever's losing always wants to berate and One.

391
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:29,064
Speaker 1: it's hard to get cards in the game.

392
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:29,749
Speaker 1: Not like Morterer.

393
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:35,724
Speaker 1: I think I like Morterer more even though we haven't actually played it yet Because it's actually hard to refill your hand so often.

394
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:40,770
Speaker 1: you know exactly what you should do But you don't have any means to do it, but everyone else also has to refill their hands.

395
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:41,387
Speaker 0: You're not alone.

396
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:48,543
Speaker 1: But like if I'll some way if someone else takes the raider or the raider just happens to be Hidden in the pile of cards that aren't used your bone.

397
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:53,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got nine turns You know if you just got to play it right straight from the beginning.

398
00:23:53,370 --> 00:24:02,622
Speaker 0: Yeah, meanwhile I could in the one game that we played I point out that I was you know, you complain that oh The guy in third place couldn't catch up whatever.

399
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:04,390
Speaker 0: well, how did he end up in third place?

400
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:13,663
Speaker 0: I was the one who figured out the game right a freaking way taking the operator and like the second turn, you know The idea is that one some people are gonna get points and other people aren't.

401
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:16,948
Speaker 0: you always want to be on the side That's gonna get points.

402
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:21,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you don't always get to choose your side and you don't always get to choose which side win you get to chew.

403
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:28,890
Speaker 0: Well, you get you know, you put as much into it as you can and if you don't put enough into it Or if you can't well, that's you know, that's part part of it.

404
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,370
Speaker 1: I'm disillusioned because Moira looks so much more interesting.

405
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:33,974
Speaker 0: Moira looks a little better.

406
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:35,037
Speaker 0: We're gonna have to play it and see.

407
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:42,778
Speaker 0: yeah, it is a newer, you know game on the same Engine and it's a little more refined.

408
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,379
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

409
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,564
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus it's got pirates man.

410
00:24:45,825 --> 00:24:47,830
Speaker 0: Yeah pirate theme always helps.

411
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,236
Speaker 1: now the bad.

412
00:24:50,538 --> 00:25:04,989
Speaker 1: we talked about Hellas before but now we've played it a little more and Every single time we've played we have run into multiple as in more than one Ambiguous rules that we had to look for a rat online and there was no errata to be found.

413
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:08,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, what kind of German board game doesn't have perfect rules?

414
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:17,589
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean we I both of us were guilty of avoiding certain strategies because we were afraid that they would end up in an ambiguous Situation where we wouldn't know how to resolve it by the rules.

415
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:18,456
Speaker 0: It doesn't help that.

416
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:25,929
Speaker 0: you know, this whole game is you know Playing cards that have certain magic powers on them and some cards are clearly better than others.

417
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:40,210
Speaker 0: Some cards are clearly better than others and you can pick which kind of card you get and the text on the cards is the only Information the game gives you as to how the cards work and the text on the cards is completely not descriptive enough

418
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:43,358
Speaker 1: Yep, or it's overly descriptive in a useless way.

419
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:52,230
Speaker 0: Yep, like this one that says take two attacks one after the other It's like alright, well do I get to regroup between the attack or am I forced to regroup?

420
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,130
Speaker 1: Do I lose my extra guys because I have a three limit or does that happen at the end of my turn?

421
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,051
Speaker 0: Doesn't tell?

422
00:25:57,071 --> 00:26:01,686
Speaker 0: doesn't tell you any of this stuff anywhere and people online are basically making arbitrary decisions.

423
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:04,514
Speaker 0: Yep Not a good thing.

424
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:09,310
Speaker 0: in a game where you want to be very precise, especially for people like us.

425
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:13,450
Speaker 1: I mean there's I guess there's two kinds of board gamers and there was evidence way back.

426
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:19,652
Speaker 1: We had a risk party where we had a bunch of people at someone's house and we split the room up and we've ever Went like.

427
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:21,418
Speaker 1: we had two groups on two different risk boards.

428
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,923
Speaker 1: Just playing two different games.

429
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:24,950
Speaker 1: one group just started playing immediately.

430
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,414
Speaker 1: That was the other group.

431
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:32,250
Speaker 1: our group sat there for about 40 minutes arguing about the rules before we even started to play.

432
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:34,545
Speaker 1: Yep, they were the latter.

433
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,069
Speaker 1: That's us.

434
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:41,726
Speaker 1: We won't play a game unless it's perfect and if the rules don't match up We will search the internet until we find errata or we just give up.

435
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:46,067
Speaker 0: Yep I mean, what's the point of playing a game if you you know, you're not gonna play it, right?

436
00:26:46,408 --> 00:26:55,657
Speaker 0: I mean The reason you play a game is because you want to have a competition that's fair and under certain rules And you have a nice thinking exercise.

437
00:26:55,677 --> 00:26:58,727
Speaker 0: if you're not clear about what the rules are or or what?

438
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,110
Speaker 1: What's the hell's the point because then it's hard to come up.

439
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:17,550
Speaker 1: I mean you can't even really come up with a strategy because like in Hellas I came up with a great strategy To load up a place and then play the to attack card and then attack twice and I'll have a bunch of guys for two Attacks, but it's not clear if I lose those extra guys due to the limit of how many guys you can have in a place.

440
00:27:18,212 --> 00:27:23,050
Speaker 0: I mean imagine just if you don't understand think about playing a game like soccer.

441
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:28,327
Speaker 0: Imagine if you weren't clear about the rules of soccer, but you played anyway, I say you weren't sure.

442
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:29,310
Speaker 0: it's no longer game.

443
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,650
Speaker 0: It's just some people kicking a ball around all willy-nilly.

444
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:32,675
Speaker 1: So, you know the rules.

445
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:38,522
Speaker 1: you just weren't sure if the goalie could actually touch the ball with his hands or not and say The ref didn't know either and you asked the rifle.

446
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:40,170
Speaker 1: What do you do if I touch the ball with my hands?

447
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,524
Speaker 1: And he says I'm not sure.

448
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:42,974
Speaker 1: Try it.

449
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:52,920
Speaker 0: You can't play a game like that And then when the goalie actually touches the ball with his hands the ref has to like call a timeout and you know What the hell's the point of playing?

450
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:54,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just crap.

451
00:27:55,571 --> 00:27:58,281
Speaker 0: The game I think would be a much better game.

452
00:27:58,462 --> 00:28:01,500
Speaker 0: if you know if you solve all the rules problems It would still be a very.

453
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,469
Speaker 0: it would be an okay game.

454
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:09,390
Speaker 1: yeah, I think what we're actually gonna do is sit down and Decide on every ambiguity and write our own little fact and put it online.

455
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:12,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would be like we can't find the official real deal.

456
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:18,398
Speaker 0: But this is what we have decided for all these rules and if any of the rules decide, you know Turn out they don't work.

457
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,285
Speaker 0: We'll change them.

458
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:28,194
Speaker 0: Yep But what I'd like to do even more is because the pieces of the game are so cool and it's two-player little Greeks little ships Little Arpa archipelagos.

459
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:32,106
Speaker 0: Yeah is to make up some sort of other game using the same pieces.

460
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:33,550
Speaker 0: That's two players and it's cool.

461
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:35,495
Speaker 1: Yeah, we need two-player games.

462
00:28:35,576 --> 00:28:40,209
Speaker 0: maybe we can make the game better just by me replacing all the cards, you know, huh?

463
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,219
Speaker 0: with a different set of cards where all the cards are equal.

464
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:49,530
Speaker 0: who hiccups where all the cards are equal and also fully descriptive?

465
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:54,856
Speaker 1: Yeah No, uh the mediocre.

466
00:28:55,377 --> 00:28:57,223
Speaker 1: Yeah Tower of Babel.

467
00:28:57,523 --> 00:28:58,807
Speaker 0: I'm glad I didn't buy that game.

468
00:28:58,827 --> 00:28:59,670
Speaker 0: It sounds bought it.

469
00:29:00,354 --> 00:29:00,998
Speaker 1: We feel bad.

470
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,669
Speaker 1: our friend bought it and it looked like a cool game.

471
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:05,589
Speaker 0: You always feel bad when someone buys a game that no one likes.

472
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:12,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, the game is just really really simple and everything's out in the open and really short.

473
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:16,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually was really short You're right because you just you.

474
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:21,070
Speaker 1: basically all you do is bid on these little discs and you get points based on the discs.

475
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:30,410
Speaker 0: The end yeah Any of you bid on certain discs and you bid certain amounts or offer certain amount.

476
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:40,409
Speaker 1: Yeah it has this really cool offer these acceptance dynamic where everyone offers bids and then the person who Started that action gets to choose which offers he takes and it affects everyone accordingly.

477
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:48,820
Speaker 1: so you're playing with four people and you pick your friend Steve bid because he's losing and you'd rather Give him some points that won't help him win.

478
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,643
Speaker 1: or you know, it's.

479
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:51,670
Speaker 1: it's got a lot of coolness to it.

480
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,155
Speaker 1: It just wasn't really well executed.

481
00:29:53,175 --> 00:30:02,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the other problem is that the offering is such a cool mechanic except for the fact that It always it seems to always pay to offer as much as you possibly can.

482
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:09,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I was trying I looked there was I offered my entire hand every round for most of the game and I tied for first.

483
00:30:09,422 --> 00:30:17,189
Speaker 0: Yep I mean I kept looking at the side of the board where there's extra scoring track and it looked to me like the extra scoring Track was where to get the big points.

484
00:30:17,634 --> 00:30:18,829
Speaker 0: So I went all out for that.

485
00:30:19,532 --> 00:30:27,750
Speaker 0: but the people who just offered a bunch of cards and didn't have their offers accepted because if someone Rejects your offer of three cards you get three points.

486
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:38,746
Speaker 0: so the people who just offered a whole bunch of cards and never had them accepted and Kept getting a bunch of points Ended up getting more points than I did going through all the effort of scoring big on the on the track.

487
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:39,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was fantastic.

488
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:41,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was pretty silly.

489
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:46,730
Speaker 1: So I would I'd like to play the game one more time to make sure but I think I'm done with that game.

490
00:30:47,355 --> 00:30:55,114
Speaker 0: I think I want to have a bidding game but I'm thinking that this game I get that Medici Medici that I hear about is the Supposedly the bidding game.

491
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:56,578
Speaker 1: to get Pizarro was fun.

492
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:57,160
Speaker 1: I liked it.

493
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,624
Speaker 0: Pizarro was the worst bidding game.

494
00:30:58,644 --> 00:30:59,907
Speaker 1: I love Pizarro.

495
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:03,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, you suck Pizarro is the purest bidding game ever.

496
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:05,941
Speaker 1: you bid on like six things and then that's it.

497
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:06,924
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

498
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:07,525
Speaker 1: That's it.

499
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:08,428
Speaker 1: Then you score.

500
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:12,037
Speaker 0: Yeah There's also that a Vegas game.

501
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:15,470
Speaker 0: I played with the board game guys that you talked about that multiple times already.

502
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seemed like a cool bidding game.

503
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,602
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know I might actually buy it depending how much it is.

504
00:31:19,662 --> 00:31:23,292
Speaker 0: now that I know that I'm gonna get a pile of monies Hmm.

505
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:24,175
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I will.

506
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:25,661
Speaker 0: we would have fun playing it.

507
00:31:26,043 --> 00:31:28,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, worst case it goes on the pile of games We don't play anymore.

508
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:30,470
Speaker 1: like to call and El Grande.

509
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:33,221
Speaker 0: Well, I just wish that you know, we had more.

510
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:35,270
Speaker 0: if we had three people we could play all these games.

511
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:37,589
Speaker 1: But well this weekend we're gonna have one of our friends out.

512
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,829
Speaker 1: All right We're thinking interviewing him because he knows a lot about biotech and that sort of thing.

513
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:48,030
Speaker 1: Place a moiré and he mispronounces anime words in a comical fashion can't even pronounce water.

514
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:50,716
Speaker 1: That's just because he's from Pennsylvania.

515
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:52,824
Speaker 0: What are what are what are?

516
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:54,270
Speaker 1: yeah, but we love Scott.

517
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:56,350
Speaker 1: Anyway, the other Scott there's two Scott's.

518
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,635
Speaker 1: That'll be great on the podcast.

519
00:31:58,655 --> 00:31:59,317
Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Scott.

520
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:00,180
Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Scott.

521
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:02,087
Speaker 0: Well, man, it'll be awesome and hilarious.

522
00:32:02,408 --> 00:32:05,889
Speaker 1: Yeah It works out cuz we call him sco Joe instead of Scott.

523
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:15,467
Speaker 1: It seems we've got a lot of instances in our lives where we've had multiple people with the same first name And we just kind of democratically assign one of them a new name and it becomes their name.

524
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:17,817
Speaker 0: Haha I am always this guy.

525
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:21,177
Speaker 1: there were three Alex's so we named one of them John Mm-hmm.

526
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,171
Speaker 0: Yep.

527
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:23,919
Speaker 1: Yeah.

528
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:26,074
Speaker 1: Yep All right.

529
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:28,322
Speaker 1: So you guys once again wanted segues.

530
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:31,137
Speaker 1: So, uh some meta bits here Mm-hmm.

531
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:41,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, well Yeah Oh We're glad that so many of you actually join the forums and checked out the website after we asked you to yep.

532
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:43,708
Speaker 0: The forums are a-hoppin.

533
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:52,808
Speaker 0: Well, they're not super hopping like some other forums I hang out in for other podcasts and things but they're definitely the most hopping ist forums that I have ever had.

534
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:57,692
Speaker 1: for me They're hopping more than our secret forum where we play Dungeons & Dragons with our friends Shh.

535
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:16,337
Speaker 0: But you know now that it's hopping, you know if anyone else is out there and wasn't joining the forums before or just joined us and Isn't in the forums or anything like that Come hang out in the forum.

536
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,123
Speaker 1: Yes, we're getting a lot of good discussion.

537
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:21,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't be a lurker I don't like lurkers.

538
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:29,190
Speaker 0: I lurk in a lot of places though I don't lurk but or at least if I lurk I post at least super rarely like when I can't contain myself.

539
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:32,421
Speaker 1: Now when I lurk I lurk as in I don't even have accounts.

540
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:33,384
Speaker 1: I just read forums.

541
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:34,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, so here's what I'm gonna do.

542
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,969
Speaker 0: I'll make I make a discussion in the forums for every podcast.

543
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:40,415
Speaker 0: now I'm gonna try to keep doing that.

544
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:43,930
Speaker 0: also it helps me keep track of the number of the podcast episode.

545
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:46,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we're coming up on 20.

546
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:46,961
Speaker 0: This might even be 20.

547
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:49,450
Speaker 1: Well, your numbering is one off from not my numbering.

548
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,815
Speaker 1: We should probably correct that at some point.

549
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:52,160
Speaker 0: How was your numbering off?

550
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,070
Speaker 0: I counted all the posts on the blog.

551
00:33:55,216 --> 00:34:00,890
Speaker 1: Yeah And one of the post is it doesn't have a track number because we posted it well after the fact after we'd started.

552
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:02,123
Speaker 0: I don't care about that.

553
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:05,630
Speaker 1: All right So the track number is one off from the number you put in the forums.

554
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:11,844
Speaker 0: The number I put in the forums is the number of Podcasts that we have put on the internet and that's how I consider to be the right.

555
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,132
Speaker 0: unless you want to name number the first One zero.

556
00:34:14,895 --> 00:34:16,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first one zero then that's fine.

557
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:19,370
Speaker 0: All right, so then I'll subtract one.

558
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:21,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

559
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever We're not worried about it.

560
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:24,739
Speaker 1: You guys are smart.

561
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,463
Speaker 1: You'll figure it out.

562
00:34:25,684 --> 00:34:34,922
Speaker 1: It's not a big deal, but Yeah, we also noticed that there's no Previous button on the main page of the of our site.

563
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:37,190
Speaker 1: So it's tough to get into all the old podcasts.

564
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,494
Speaker 0: I'm gonna fix that.

565
00:34:38,514 --> 00:34:39,257
Speaker 0: I don't know.

566
00:34:39,317 --> 00:34:40,661
Speaker 0: This is a broken WordPress theme.

567
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:41,885
Speaker 1: We just noticed it.

568
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:43,188
Speaker 1: So don't hate on us.

569
00:34:44,056 --> 00:34:45,649
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone's had a problem with it yet.

570
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:49,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hope no one tried to go into our archives and couldn't get there.

571
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:55,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is a search box so you can search for a podcast, you know the format of the day.

572
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,943
Speaker 0: You can just type in like.

573
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:58,237
Speaker 0: oh You know seven.

574
00:34:58,257 --> 00:35:03,984
Speaker 1: whatever the number the date is and then There is not a single one that has 007 in it.

575
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:05,089
Speaker 0: I just be quiet.

576
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:07,467
Speaker 1: Where did you come up with that?

577
00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:20,516
Speaker 0: They all start with zeros And I picked seven because it's a nice number You know, I must add James Bond in my mind or something, yeah Alright, yeah, that's all we got.

578
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:23,204
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna segue into the closing music now.

579
00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:25,330
