1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,249
Speaker 0: It's Thursday April 19th.

2
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:13,372
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:15,940
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:23,820
Speaker 0: Tonight we ramble a bit about taxes particularly income taxes in the United States of America.

5
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:29,218
Speaker 0: Because they're so awesome Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:35,060
Speaker 1: So I haven't been wearing headphones during the show for the past couple of weeks.

7
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:40,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, partly because we have a bunch of audio equipment a bunch of cables all the fancy stuff laying around.

8
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:43,019
Speaker 0: But we kind of got it all ad hoc.

9
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:51,632
Speaker 0: So the cable Scott was actually using to sit across the room and still have headphones Was probably the most dubious cable we have ever owned.

10
00:00:51,793 --> 00:01:03,000
Speaker 1: Well, actually I bought that cable a long time ago like high school days so that I could Sit in my bed while still wearing headphones attached to the stereo across the room far away.

11
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:10,040
Speaker 0: I used to have a similar cable from what I wanted to record audio from my tape player to some other device in my house.

12
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:11,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically this the cable works.

13
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:21,078
Speaker 1: run one end There's a big hole so you can put in your big headphone cable into it And on the other end is a tiny stick that you put into the stereo to get the music to come out.

14
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,029
Speaker 0: the holes Jerry the hole the holes.

15
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:32,000
Speaker 1: I'm putting this in the non-technical terms And it's like 20 feet long so you can just run around the house all willy-nilly without worrying about it so much.

16
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:34,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, the old cable not working so well yep.

17
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,985
Speaker 1: So now that I'm podcasting I use this cable to get the headphones from across the room over to the mixer Which is sitting over on the other side of the room.

18
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:58,840
Speaker 1: of course what happened is after a time the cable didn't work so well and I Couldn't hear in one ear and I would have to like twist and turn the connector on the cable in order to hear in both Ears that like unplug it plug it back in and it just got worse and worse.

19
00:01:59,241 --> 00:01:59,964
Speaker 0: You know you should.

20
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:12,370
Speaker 0: here's what it sounds like through my headphones because these are really fancy Expensive nice headphones that I got as a gift a hundred years ago fifteen years ago Yeah, and I think it was from my brother in fact, and they're.

21
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:15,520
Speaker 0: they're held together by tape and hope and that's about it.

22
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:19,860
Speaker 1: I had also good headphones that I bought for 40 bucks like in high school days.

23
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:27,440
Speaker 1: Those are the ones that I used with that cable Originally, but they were the kind that had foam not the foam that has like leather around it.

24
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,215
Speaker 1: just saw the foam like on the ear parts.

25
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:35,435
Speaker 1: ah and Over time that foam got nasty and disintegrated and bad stuff.

26
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,281
Speaker 0: Yeah, there would always know there's nothing I could do.

27
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:41,960
Speaker 0: it always kind of rub off of those things into little horrible balls that stuck to everything yep.

28
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:53,700
Speaker 1: So I threw those out and even though they were really good when they were new yeah now I have these $20 shitty radio shacks where there's separate volume controls for each ear which is actually sometimes useful.

29
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:55,252
Speaker 1: We wouldn't expect.

30
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,773
Speaker 1: yeah Surprisingly basically they're crap, but they work well enough.

31
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:00,336
Speaker 0: yep.

32
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:04,780
Speaker 0: meanwhile mine are awesome But they barely work, so I don't know which one of us is in a better situation.

33
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:05,480
Speaker 1: I don't know either.

34
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:12,173
Speaker 1: But I went to Radio Shack today because it's next to the grocery and I bought a new cable The same kind of cable only new and it works.

35
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:16,140
Speaker 1: and now I can hear again And I can tolerate wearing these headphones again.

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,320
Speaker 0: Yep, semi randomly though the Radio Shack moved everything around and they had a little flexible microphone arm.

37
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:27,414
Speaker 0: Well they've always had those yeah But I never really noticed him and it was actually cheaper than I thought it would.

38
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:28,820
Speaker 0: you just wanted to buy something.

39
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,213
Speaker 0: No, I actually had wanted something like this for a while.

40
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,540
Speaker 0: I just never noticed it at Radio Shack.

41
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:34,069
Speaker 0: I didn't really look too hard.

42
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,096
Speaker 1: I've seen him there before.

43
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:42,320
Speaker 0: well I got it and while I was walking out of the store I thought you know Radio Shack sells crappy microphones that are really light.

44
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:46,400
Speaker 0: I wonder if this thing will be able to hold up my very heavy real microphone.

45
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, I probably don't need to worry about it.

46
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:49,394
Speaker 0: I came home.

47
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:53,519
Speaker 0: I put it all together I set it up and it immediately falls over in droops.

48
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:59,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, so now I've fixed the base to my desk until I get a heavy weight to stick under it.

49
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:02,069
Speaker 0: So there's some duct tape action there.

50
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:04,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty funny.

51
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:10,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Scott got the boom and I kind of got jealous because it's really nice to have the microphone Just hovering in front of you.

52
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,603
Speaker 0: You don't have to bend over.

53
00:04:11,623 --> 00:04:22,563
Speaker 1: I mostly got the boom only because now I can have both hands on the laptop or whatever else I'm doing or you know, just hands-free without having to hold the stupid microphone Of course even better.

54
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:30,106
Speaker 0: my final important upgrade the thing that's bugged me forever was that I have as far an awesome CRT because I bought it.

55
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,811
Speaker 0: God knows how like eight years ago.

56
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:34,138
Speaker 1: That means CRT means old-style monitor.

57
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:34,680
Speaker 1: That's like a TV.

58
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, this thing is gigantic.

59
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,320
Speaker 0: It weighs an infinite number of pounds.

60
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:40,645
Speaker 1: No, because you can lift it.

61
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,892
Speaker 0: It uses quite a bit of electricity.

62
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,256
Speaker 0: It makes noises.

63
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,640
Speaker 0: Sometimes it makes smell.

64
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,744
Speaker 1: Yep, those things are all true.

65
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,880
Speaker 0: However, it works very well, and I would have kept it for a long a lot longer.

66
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,400
Speaker 1: It doesn't work as well as rim says it does but it works well.

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,422
Speaker 0: All right, leave it this way.

68
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:57,710
Speaker 0: It works a lot better than the LCD.

69
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,933
Speaker 0: I'm currently looking at.

70
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:00,657
Speaker 1: Uh, no, not really.

71
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:03,406
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, that LCD is alright.

72
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,674
Speaker 0: Have you used this LCD for any amount of time?

73
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:07,038
Speaker 0: because the colors come and go.

74
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:07,500
Speaker 1: that's me.

75
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,830
Speaker 1: That's not the LCDs problem.

76
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,817
Speaker 1: That's the the computer.

77
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,839
Speaker 0: now I don't know mother before I plug it into the Mac I get issues with it.

78
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:16,194
Speaker 1: Really I didn't have issues when it was when we were using it at.

79
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,580
Speaker 1: katsu kana had no problems with it.

80
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,324
Speaker 1: I thought it was great.

81
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:21,580
Speaker 0: I'd keep angling it cuz sometimes the contrast would just go buggy for a while.

82
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:23,050
Speaker 1: I think you got a problem.

83
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:24,420
Speaker 1: No, I didn't have that problem.

84
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,700
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, the thing is also just ugly and not the greatest thing.

85
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,320
Speaker 0: It is an ugly but anyway LCD little known fact that one of the things I learned about audio early on.

86
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:38,460
Speaker 0: So I got this these microphones and I'm sitting there and I'm doing recording and drop trying it out.

87
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:45,545
Speaker 0: And then we go to do the show and I pick up this low hum and I do a bunch of research and I try To figure out where this hum is coming from.

88
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:46,529
Speaker 0: and I can't isolate it.

89
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:47,553
Speaker 0: No ground loops.

90
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:48,317
Speaker 0: Everything's fine.

91
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:49,120
Speaker 0: Look what the hell?

92
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:50,626
Speaker 0: Well, I bought these microphones.

93
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:51,128
Speaker 0: I get a hum.

94
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:51,791
Speaker 0: What's the problem?

95
00:05:52,333 --> 00:06:12,277
Speaker 0: And then one day I my monitor I turned it off for some reason and the home was gone and I eventually figured out that because we were using dynamic microphones the moving alternating magnetic field from the CRT was Moving the actuator in the microphone at a number of Hertz equal to my refresh rate

96
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,070
Speaker 1: and it's true That's.

97
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:14,799
Speaker 1: that's what'll happen.

98
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:24,391
Speaker 1: So for anyone out there doing some podcasting action if you got microphones that are the dynamic variety Which you should which is condenser microphones are for suckers and rich people.

99
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:32,278
Speaker 0: Yep, or professional people, which you aren't Yeah, but even a lot of professionals actually use dynamic mics because they're not really worse.

100
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:47,292
Speaker 1: Yeah you Usually just get high-end expensive dynamic mics But anyway, uh Don't use them near a CRT and get an LCD if you can because there's no magnets in there The more there's no oscillating ones.

101
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:48,640
Speaker 0: Well, I'm buying a new computer soon.

102
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,424
Speaker 0: I talked about this for a while because this computer is barely alive Barely alive.

103
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:56,010
Speaker 1: It's it's like a miracle computer three more days.

104
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,920
Speaker 1: It's like the story of Hanukkah like one bit of oil last eight days.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like one shitty ass bit of computer last eight years.

106
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:11,087
Speaker 0: I remember a month ago when I turned this computer off and it didn't turn back on Magically it turned back on an hour later.

107
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:13,014
Speaker 1: Yeah, that should have been it.

108
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:15,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but real soon I'm gonna buy a new computer.

109
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:16,366
Speaker 1: Well, it would have.

110
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:23,000
Speaker 1: actually if you think about it The original plan was you were just gonna replace it with that Mac Mini, but the Mac OS didn't hold up.

111
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,311
Speaker 0: Yeah, whose idea was that?

112
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:25,320
Speaker 1: It was a good idea.

113
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,785
Speaker 1: Everyone else agreed with me.

114
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:32,760
Speaker 1: It was a good idea on paper - we know what we both learned from that lesson.

115
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:40,132
Speaker 0: I will say it was a good idea on paper because when I actually analyzed it I agreed with you and I thought you know what Mac's are awesome.

116
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:42,440
Speaker 0: screw this non Mac bullshit.

117
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:48,689
Speaker 1: Well, at least you know, I considered everything you did and I looked at the piece of paper and said hey Everything rim does the Mac does.

118
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:49,373
Speaker 1: but we didn't know.

119
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:50,640
Speaker 1: is the Mac did it shitty?

120
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:51,849
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is the.

121
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:59,580
Speaker 0: the Mac would have been fine If I was also willing to pay for the requisite audio software as opposed to using the free things that don't work.

122
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:01,202
Speaker 1: True.

123
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:04,577
Speaker 0: also the fact that the thing is you technically paid for the garage band.

124
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,613
Speaker 1: It's not free Yeah, but I life that you pay for it in the price of the machine.

125
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:10,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had words about garage.

126
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,757
Speaker 0: Hey, I think people remember that two-week stint where I did nothing but bitch about it.

127
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:20,340
Speaker 0: Yep But I realized that LCD prices haven't come down in several months.

128
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:36,797
Speaker 1: so I just I'm gonna buy a gigantic widescreen LCD tonight and it'll get here probably Monday and So long CRT, yep I bought a lot of stuff recently too and I'm buying some more stuff and I'll probably tell you all about the things I am Buying next week.

129
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:37,640
Speaker 0: God, we're vinyl.

130
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,429
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm buying this DS light in this monitor.

131
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,177
Speaker 0: You bought that awesome laptop.

132
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:42,400
Speaker 0: and now the laptop stuff.

133
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:43,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm buying stuff.

134
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:44,630
Speaker 0: We're buying speaker.

135
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:46,679
Speaker 0: We're just going on this spending spree.

136
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:47,985
Speaker 0: That's probably not going to end.

137
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:49,010
Speaker 0: Well, I'm looking at a new car.

138
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,541
Speaker 1: No, I'm not looking that far bought a car.

139
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:56,953
Speaker 0: Yeah paying for that thing Hey, whatever.

140
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:57,415
Speaker 0: Yep.

141
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:02,230
Speaker 0: So anyway in the news, I don't think this is really news to any geeks.

142
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:06,741
Speaker 0: I want to bring it up only because it makes me feel Incredibly in tune with everything.

143
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:07,364
Speaker 0: That is awesome.

144
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:09,815
Speaker 0: But at the same time Incredibly old.

145
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:22,984
Speaker 0: you see the Simpsons as of today is 20 years old and I wait 20 years since it was on TV 20 years since Matt Groening thought about it 20 years since.

146
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:29,566
Speaker 0: on April 19th 1987 on the Tracy Allman show there was a two-minute animated short.

147
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:34,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, the first appearance Yes, and I saw that on TV with my family.

148
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:36,450
Speaker 0: My family loved the Tracy Allman show.

149
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:44,825
Speaker 0: I often would stay up and watch it and I watched every episode of the Simpsons from 1987 until when I went to college and gave up TV.

150
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:45,850
Speaker 1: think about this, right?

151
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:49,241
Speaker 1: The Simpsons were on when I was in elementary school.

152
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:51,570
Speaker 1: people kids talked about that like in fifth grade.

153
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,470
Speaker 1: I remember kids talking about the episode where he jumped over the gorge on the skateboard.

154
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,121
Speaker 0: In fact, the Simpsons when we were young was controversial.

155
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:00,285
Speaker 1: It was controversial.

156
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:01,850
Speaker 1: They were like, oh kids shouldn't be watching this.

157
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,387
Speaker 0: Yeah There were parents who would talk to my parents and say things like how do you let your kids watch that trash?

158
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,969
Speaker 0: and I'd love To go back in time and show them Family Guy?

159
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,325
Speaker 1: And people think that the censors are winning.

160
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:26,392
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, but I mean like, you know it was controversial cuz it was a cartoon and up until then the closest to cartoon got to having mature themes was the Flintstones and Cartel.

161
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:28,199
Speaker 0: you mean the honeymooners animated?

162
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,444
Speaker 0: Yes with dinosaurs.

163
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:30,588
Speaker 1: I like the Flintstones though.

164
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:31,050
Speaker 0: You know what?

165
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,122
Speaker 0: I really like the Flintstones to yeah a lot more than the Jetsons.

166
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:37,914
Speaker 0: Uh, see I like the Jets Different way.

167
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:39,301
Speaker 0: remember the movie where they meet.

168
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:40,646
Speaker 1: it's not a good movie.

169
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:41,350
Speaker 0: It's not that bad.

170
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,754
Speaker 1: But anyway What was I saying?

171
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:46,037
Speaker 0: I don't know right?

172
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:48,884
Speaker 1: Simpsons old elementary school geezers.

173
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:49,445
Speaker 1: Are we?

174
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:51,310
Speaker 0: yes old we feel now.

175
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,422
Speaker 1: Imagine the people who are like middle-aged when the Simpsons were new.

176
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,290
Speaker 1: Well, it's like when I'm all today.

177
00:10:56,551 --> 00:11:07,875
Speaker 0: I was listening to it's all politics from NPR News and They were talking about the Tonight Show, but not with Johnny Carson, but with the guy before him Was a guy.

178
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:09,361
Speaker 0: I know that's what I thought I was like.

179
00:11:09,823 --> 00:11:11,550
Speaker 0: what what are you talking about?

180
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,424
Speaker 0: There's no guy before Johnny Carson, and I never even saw Johnny.

181
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:15,725
Speaker 1: I never.

182
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,030
Speaker 1: actually I don't watch it now either.

183
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,477
Speaker 1: I never really watched any of those late shows.

184
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:22,005
Speaker 0: I'll admit I'd really until the Daily Show.

185
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:26,736
Speaker 0: I hated shows like and now I'm Supposedly making one I guess Wow.

186
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:27,939
Speaker 0: I never really thought of that.

187
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:28,460
Speaker 0: We're the red.

188
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:33,898
Speaker 1: I mean if we had we're imitating something We're not a fan of and we don't watch.

189
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,169
Speaker 0: the thing is I'm really a fan of the Daily Show.

190
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:38,483
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Daily Show isn't a late show though.

191
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:39,389
Speaker 0: It's no it's not it.

192
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:46,789
Speaker 0: I figure that it's the successor to the idea of the late show because time shifting has made that idea obsolete in my mind.

193
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:53,305
Speaker 1: You know granted a lot of people don't time shift yet People who are middle-aged when the Simpsons came out.

194
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:54,210
Speaker 0: I can't imagine that.

195
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:01,345
Speaker 0: I can't imagine scheduling my life or having to worry about when some when some form of entertainment I wanted to see was available to me.

196
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:05,724
Speaker 1: Yep All right, so I got a tech news, but it can't wait until Monday.

197
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:06,607
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna give it to you.

198
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:07,230
Speaker 1: nice and easy.

199
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:08,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is some pretty good.

200
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,826
Speaker 1: This is the big news.

201
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:10,470
Speaker 1: It's all over.

202
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,709
Speaker 1: You can't possibly miss this unless you are completely detached from all internets.

203
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:23,624
Speaker 1: The new version of Ubuntu Ubuntu the feisty fawn is out.

204
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:24,927
Speaker 1: It's not a beta.

205
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:27,389
Speaker 1: It's not an alpha It's the real deal.

206
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:29,118
Speaker 1: You can go and get it right now.

207
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:40,140
Speaker 0: and I gotta say and this is coming from Captain cynic of the USS cynical about any advance in Linux technology Mister doesn't update software unless there's a reason.

208
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, or I resisted Firefox up until like 0.9 something.

209
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:47,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was using Firefox 0.6 when it was Phoenix.

210
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,589
Speaker 0: So I used what I used it when it was still.

211
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,921
Speaker 1: no I used Phoenix 0.5.

212
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:53,242
Speaker 1: I did.

213
00:12:53,283 --> 00:12:54,830
Speaker 0: I remember it might have been 0.7.

214
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,499
Speaker 0: I used it when it was Phoenix and then I bitched.

215
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,650
Speaker 0: when they changed it to fire bird and I didn't call it firebird.

216
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:07,814
Speaker 0: I kept calling it Phoenix and then they kept called it Firefox and then I started saying Firefox probably because I like Foxes and I like fire.

217
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:11,246
Speaker 1: see that was the point in time where I still believe that name changes wouldn't work.

218
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,775
Speaker 1: people would just rebel And keep the old name.

219
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:19,778
Speaker 1: and now I see the truth in that I like old names and I want to fight to keep them But it's always a losing battle.

220
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,350
Speaker 1: It was the last time you called the Wii the revolution game over.

221
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:22,869
Speaker 1: You know what?

222
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:29,302
Speaker 0: You know when the last time I called the Wii the revolution was when on an episode of this show when I said Fuck if I'm gonna call it the Wii.

223
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

224
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:40,309
Speaker 1: So for anyone out there if you've never tried Ubuntu if you're afraid of Linux if you're anti Linux if you tried Linux at one point you hate it.

225
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,345
Speaker 1: Maybe you already using it, which means you just update and I don't need to tell you anything.

226
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:45,690
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

227
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,174
Speaker 1: You should try this.

228
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:48,418
Speaker 1: there is absolutely.

229
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:59,032
Speaker 1: it costs you nothing except maybe I don't know a half hour of your Time as long as it takes to download a CD and there's absolutely no risk Whatsoever.

230
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,441
Speaker 1: you cannot possibly ruin your computer.

231
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:03,930
Speaker 1: You don't have to erase any of your data.

232
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:04,493
Speaker 1: You.

233
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:06,683
Speaker 1: this is there's no risk at all.

234
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:07,668
Speaker 1: You might well.

235
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:18,270
Speaker 0: Theoretically if you get the free CD from Ubuntu Ubuntu and the person who packages it has the Asian bird flu and it gets shipped to you.

236
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,109
Speaker 1: Okay, and then so here's what you do.

237
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:21,565
Speaker 1: Here's what you do.

238
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:21,889
Speaker 1: you ready?

239
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,497
Speaker 1: Step one make sure you have a CD burner.

240
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:26,041
Speaker 1: step two a blank CD.

241
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:27,525
Speaker 1: step three an internet connection.

242
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:29,049
Speaker 1: go to Ubuntu.

Speaker 1: calm Download dot-com.

244
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:32,302
Speaker 1: you got to stop saying that.

245
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:33,347
Speaker 0: I gotta say it's really.

246
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:34,170
Speaker 1: you know you say Ubuntu.

247
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,738

00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:38,544
Speaker 1: it's like hurts when you say that in my headphones?

249
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,053
Speaker 0: really yes doesn't hurt me Whatever.

250
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,042
Speaker 1: so you go to Ubuntu.

251
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:50,805
Speaker 1: calm you click on That you go follow the links to the download section and it'll say what release do you want?

252
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:55,220
Speaker 1: you want desktop edition 7.04 which means April.

253
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,941
Speaker 1: oh seven seven oh four uh-huh ooh Yeah, boom - what type of computer do you have?

254
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:03,470
Speaker 1: you say you have a standard personal computer?

255
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,641
Speaker 1: But you might have another kind.

256
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:05,267
Speaker 1: just choose.

257
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:06,072
Speaker 0: yeah You'll know.

258
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:07,961
Speaker 0: cuz if you know it's the simplest form.

259
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:09,066
Speaker 1: then it says where do you live?

260
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:10,010
Speaker 1: you pick a country?

261
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,938
Speaker 1: And then you click start download.

262
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:14,250
Speaker 1: it will download an ISO file.

263
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:17,381
Speaker 1: you need to burn this ISO file to a CD.

264
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:24,737
Speaker 0: the way you do that is you use something like Nero or Roxio or I forget the name of it, but I've installed it on every Windows PC I've ever used.

265
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,169
Speaker 0: I'll post in the forums a link to it.

266
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,334
Speaker 0: But there's a thing.

267
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:33,018
Speaker 0: you can download that because Windows 2000 and XP might have been just XP I don't remember can burn.

268
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:34,967
Speaker 0: ISO is natively with no software.

269
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:39,987
Speaker 0: however Microsoft hid that from you, and you have to install a program that will open it up.

270
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,106
Speaker 1: yep But anyway you burn this ISO file to a CD.

271
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:43,670
Speaker 1: congratulations.

272
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,500
Speaker 1: Now you take the CD, and you keep it in your CD-ROM.

273
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,263
Speaker 1: You don't take it out.

274
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:50,510
Speaker 1: you restart your computer.

275
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:54,656
Speaker 1: Your computer should boot not from your hard drive But from the CD.

276
00:15:55,601 --> 00:16:02,380
Speaker 1: if it does not boot from the CD And it just boots into Windows normally or boots into Mac normally Then you have to do some sort of.

277
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:11,320
Speaker 1: you have to change your BIOS or hold some key Combination or go to your boot menu to tell your computer to boot from the CD-ROM Before it boots from the hard drive.

278
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,707
Speaker 0: in fact if you are unable to make it boot Post in our forum, and we or someone will help you.

279
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,770
Speaker 1: yes I will tell you what you need to do to make it boot from the CD.

280
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,643
Speaker 1: But in most cases it should just boot from the CD.

281
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:33,449
Speaker 1: it might take a while But it'll boot from the CD and you'll say I would like to install or run Linux Ubuntu Linux, and don't worry It's not going to install yet.

282
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,922
Speaker 1: It'll just run and it'll run and it'll boot Ubuntu Linux from the CD.

283
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:41,733
Speaker 1: it won't write or read any data from your hard drive At all.

284
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,302
Speaker 1: none of your Windows data will be touched.

285
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:58,350
Speaker 1: you can try Ubuntu Linux Completely risk-free to see what it's all about and not have to worry about anything and when you don't want to use it anymore Just shut down the computer and take the CD out and you'll be back to Windows like Linux was never there.

286
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:05,810
Speaker 1: You have no excuse not to try this so that you can actually discuss it intelligently and with experience.

287
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:10,550
Speaker 1: You don't have to like it You don't have to switch to it and erase your windows and install Linux.

288
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:17,265
Speaker 1: But you have to try it because there's no reason not to at this point And this is the best Linux ever for desktops.

289
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:18,089
Speaker 1: do it now.

290
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:20,016
Speaker 1: What do you still listen to this for?

291
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,526
Speaker 1: I guess you could listen and solve the same thing.

292
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:32,939
Speaker 0: Ubuntu Things of the day now.

293
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:38,730
Speaker 0: because it was the 20th anniversary of the Simpsons I figured I should have another anniversary kind of thing for my thing of the day.

294
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:52,906
Speaker 0: well, it just so happens that this week was the one-year anniversary of Probably one of the oddest funniest Sadest and most painful to think about things that I've really ever seen on the internet.

295
00:17:52,986 --> 00:17:54,632
Speaker 1: to talk about how significant This is.

296
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:59,292
Speaker 1: it was the only place that this existed on the internet was a story on Fark basically And I don't.

297
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,075
Speaker 1: I don't read Fark.

298
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:04,150
Speaker 1: I get Fark via other people talking about it, and I remember this.

299
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,398
Speaker 1: That's how big it was.

300
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,713
Speaker 0: now basically a Someone posted.

301
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:12,484
Speaker 0: he was a total Farker and he posted the following to Fark.

302
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:13,628
Speaker 0: now the way Fark works.

303
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:23,190
Speaker 0: if you post something It's kind of like dig whatever you submit stories And it appears in total Fark where only the super super super nerds who pay for total Fark which it costs real money.

304
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:24,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like five bucks.

305
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,370
Speaker 0: It's almost nothing, but it's real money.

306
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,996
Speaker 0: Well the thing is you get it.

307
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,224
Speaker 0: basically you see everything that's submitted to Fark.

308
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:34,749
Speaker 0: if you need to kill some time on the internet Total Fark is still by far the best way.

309
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:39,749
Speaker 1: well No, you can go to dig and put the upcoming stories, which is just as crazy I don't know.

310
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:50,510
Speaker 0: I think Fark is better because you get more of the information in a much more condensed and Immediate form perhaps, but either way it's a whole bunch of crap at a whole little bit of space.

311
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:54,544
Speaker 0: Well someone posted under the advice category quote.

312
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:59,240
Speaker 0: I am stuck to my chair I'm so very scared help uh-huh.

313
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:07,430
Speaker 0: and immediately in that he made a post And the post is I'm going to read it as far exactly all right without going into too much detail.

314
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:08,610
Speaker 0: Here's the situation.

315
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:14,108
Speaker 0: I am total Farking in my boxers and sitting on a chair that has slightly spaced out planks.

316
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:21,470
Speaker 0: Suffice to say that part of me is now lodged and any attempt to move just pinches the crap out of me.

317
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:25,888
Speaker 0: Can't move need advice Soonish.

318
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:26,725
Speaker 0: oh God it hurts.

319
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:32,369
Speaker 0: Okay, it's still funny that the second post is haha pull hard take video.

320
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:35,687
Speaker 0: the third post is a picture of Nelson from the Simpsons

321
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:35,968
Speaker 1: and

322
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:52,550
Speaker 0: What follows over the course of a far too many posts is The people who were on total Fark at the time and then real Fark because this was green-lighted to the main page Trying to help this gentleman get out of the situation.

323
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:58,690
Speaker 0: The situation was basically he has this kind of chair and the chair is a picture of the chair.

324
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,929
Speaker 1: Okay, I can't imagine it.

325
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,973
Speaker 0: You can just go to the threads.

326
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:09,970
Speaker 0: in fact the the end of this saga is a picture the guy took of himself flipping off the chair Not backflipping middle finger flipping.

327
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:12,198
Speaker 0: it's this kind of chair where it's.

328
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:18,906
Speaker 0: the seat is made out of like three or four pieces of wood like slats and There there's there's tiny tiny gaps between them.

329
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:30,509
Speaker 0: now The guy is kind of heavy so he sits down and the gaps all kind of spread out a little bit And if they pinch around something or something gets pushed in there from using the chair you get up Let's let's come back together and pinch it.

330
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,630
Speaker 1: So why didn't he just sit down some more to spread them out again?

331
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,550
Speaker 0: He tried and then as soon as he tried to get back up and pinched again.

332
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:45,631
Speaker 0: But you you sit down you lift up the boys and then ride and basically the thread is people saying smart things Like.

333
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:47,398
Speaker 0: we're saying well have you tried this?

334
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:48,543
Speaker 0: why don't you just do this?

335
00:20:48,844 --> 00:20:52,561
Speaker 0: and he tries things they don't work And they're stuck in there pretty deep.

336
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:54,570
Speaker 0: This is the slats are pretty widely.

337
00:20:55,974 --> 00:21:12,390
Speaker 0: It's not a good situation And that the epic saga that unfolded with people submitting various ideas The point at which I left out loud because I'm still working at IBM at the time And I was just sitting in my office following this thread over the course of is right away.

338
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,596
Speaker 0: Someone's like well.

339
00:21:13,696 --> 00:21:16,229
Speaker 0: What's within reach of you, and the guy says what he can get to.

340
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:18,795
Speaker 0: and Someone's like should I call 9-1-1?

341
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:19,116
Speaker 0: whatever?

342
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:21,806
Speaker 0: and one guy says I see you have access to matches.

343
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:22,990
Speaker 0: the chair is made of wood.

344
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:25,330
Speaker 0: Right set it on fire problem solved.

345
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:40,302
Speaker 1: So true but yeah, this is a great moment in internet history that should be remembered for years to come and recognizing it on its anniversary is pretty good because People who didn't see it the first time can go back and see it again.

346
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:45,690
Speaker 1: and while I'm against old news And if someone would have come up to me and said hey, did you hear about this guy?

347
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:51,649
Speaker 1: I would have been like that is such old news, but saying hey There's old news to check out in case you missed it is okay.

348
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:59,029
Speaker 0: So the on FARC on the anniversary they had a thread the one-year anniversary of one of the funniest FARC threads of all time.

349
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:08,214
Speaker 0: and Early on in this thread there was someone who hadn't seen the original thread who saw a picture of the chair and basically said oh My god.

350
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:10,144
Speaker 0: I had a chair exactly like that.

351
00:22:10,426 --> 00:22:11,109
Speaker 0: fuck that chair.

352
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:13,268
Speaker 0: That happened all the time.

353
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:19,670
Speaker 0: There's a picture of a chain link fence with two tennis balls.

354
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:22,716
Speaker 1: So this is a lesson to everyone.

355
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:29,261
Speaker 1: if you buy chairs do not buy chairs made with wood slats Yes, and do not sit in them in your boxers.

356
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:31,350
Speaker 1: get a office chair with a nice cushion.

357
00:22:31,578 --> 00:22:34,399
Speaker 0: Yes You see remember the operative thing here is that one.

358
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:39,341
Speaker 0: the guy was using his computer in his boxers for long enough for the nuts To migrate into that little crack.

359
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:51,351
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, and two this is if you can't visualize the situation Anyone who's used a trackball especially an older one a lot of times the edges of the trackball would like catch your finger and pinch You.

360
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:52,655
Speaker 0: it's a lot like that.

361
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:56,026
Speaker 0: That's only worse happening to your nuts.

362
00:22:56,387 --> 00:22:57,370
Speaker 1: Oh, you're you're screwing him.

363
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,754
Speaker 1: I don't imagine the actual nuts getting stuck in there.

364
00:22:59,874 --> 00:23:09,485
Speaker 0: I will point out from because he actually did post a picture of the business and They were in there a little deeper than you might have thought.

365
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,982
Speaker 0: Uh Now it wasn't like the worst possible situation where.

366
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:20,173
Speaker 0: imagine if the nuts were somehow beneath entirely and inside was just Like.

367
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:23,684
Speaker 1: I could imagine that maybe some like the connecting tubes would have been stuck.

368
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:24,707
Speaker 1: that could have been bad.

369
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:34,433
Speaker 0: Yeah This thread was hilarious and horrible and the funniest part of all this is that Fark made this thread linking to the original thread on The anniversary.

370
00:23:34,936 --> 00:23:40,879
Speaker 0: now the original thread had been archived on Fark So it was either on a different server or handled a different way.

371
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,510
Speaker 0: the traffic from the main thing pointing to that.

372
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:50,770
Speaker 0: Fark Farked itself and brought his own archive down from the number of people clicking on this old thread.

373
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:58,923
Speaker 0: awesome super awesome My god, yeah, I just saw one of the old pictures and I'm laughing.

374
00:23:59,324 --> 00:24:10,089
Speaker 0: it's an Oregon Trail Screenshot and they're in the river and the rivers flooded and it says big z2k got his nutsack stuck in a chair *laughter*.

375
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:18,670
Speaker 1: Okay anyway Some compare- by comparison my thing of the day is chump change, but it's still funny.

376
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:21,602
Speaker 0: That's okay cuz you've punned me a couple times on things of the day.

377
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:22,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

378
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:33,050
Speaker 1: it's a. basically it's a photograph of a mobile billboard and the billboard has a picture of a cop with a Radar gun pointing straight at you and it says speeding.

379
00:24:33,692 --> 00:24:34,855
Speaker 1: What's your excuse?

380
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:35,698
Speaker 1: question mark.

381
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:49,265
Speaker 1: and I can't tell if it's actually spray-painted on the sign or if it's Photoshopped onto the sign but it doesn't matter what it says on the sign in spray paint or what looks like spray paint is Helping you bastards pay for donuts smiley face.

382
00:24:49,747 --> 00:24:51,789
Speaker 0: I Got to admit I laughed out loud.

383
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:58,746
Speaker 1: I laughed quite a bit when I saw this one and if you're not laughing now go take a look and then laugh because it's funny and true.

384
00:25:00,072 --> 00:25:06,132
Speaker 0: The fact that the smiley face is a little off-center and a little crooked for some reason that is the exact thing that did it To me.

385
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:09,251
Speaker 1: Yeah, just the way the smiley face is painted Like.

386
00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:16,670
Speaker 1: it's just perfect sort of like in that I am confident that this box contains cell phones Just the way the spider was grabbing his entire eyeball.

387
00:25:21,172 --> 00:25:24,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the example I always go to for you know.

388
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:30,970
Speaker 1: Visual like image humor like when the image itself regardless of what the joke is is funny.

389
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:32,597
Speaker 1: Just to look at it, you know.

390
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:42,964
Speaker 0: All right today, so For those of you who live in the United States, you're aware that very recently Taxes were due where they do you this week.

391
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:56,090
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the 17th New York State being bitches said hey, they're due the 16th, but they were actually due the 17th, but I won't get into that No, but yeah, I don't know really how taxes work in other countries so much.

392
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:58,890
Speaker 1: I know you pay a lot more of them and some places a lot less.

393
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,217
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot more.

394
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:02,670
Speaker 0: the thing is a lot of the places that you pay a lot more.

395
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:05,370
Speaker 0: It seems like you get more back per dollar.

396
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:06,977
Speaker 1: It's a tough call.

397
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:08,790
Speaker 1: we'd have to actually do some math to figure that out.

398
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:17,925
Speaker 0: Well, just in terms of I look at the social services that I see in various socialists and semi-socialist countries And not saying that they're all the greatest places to live but

399
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:18,729
Speaker 1: a lot

400
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:26,009
Speaker 0: of them Seems like not only do they take more of your money But they deal with the money more efficiently and you get enough back to where it's worth

401
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,110
Speaker 1: it.

402
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:33,465
Speaker 1: I think what it is that they spend most of the money on The people like the citizens as opposed to we spend the money on stuff.

403
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:37,799
Speaker 1: It's just not stuff that the citizens Oh, you mean like foreign wars of occupation.

404
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,243
Speaker 1: Well, no, not just that.

405
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:40,668
Speaker 1: yeah percentage-wise.

406
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:41,410
Speaker 1: That's not so much.

407
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:50,824
Speaker 1: I'm talking about stuff like farm subsidies where if you're a farmer you notice if you're not a farmer you don't notice or Stuff that you don't realize the government's paying for like keeping airlines in business.

408
00:26:50,844 --> 00:26:52,370
Speaker 1: Yeah stuff like that.

409
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:54,482
Speaker 1: That's where a lot of our money goes into bullshit.

410
00:26:54,602 --> 00:27:05,527
Speaker 1: instead of other countries They spend their money on things that go directly to people like medicine goes directly to people or school Which we do spend money on school, but not as much.

411
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:14,830
Speaker 0: Yep now we're not gonna get into a whole argument about Socialism and taxes and capitalism and all those things because our views are complex to put it lightly.

412
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:20,150
Speaker 1: Yes, we're gonna talk about the actual process of filing taxes in the United States and how not to be stupid about it.

413
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, now we're gonna generally.

414
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:25,330
Speaker 0: we're not gonna go into detail about how it actually works on the deep down.

415
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,150
Speaker 1: We're not gonna give tax advice either because I don't think we're allowed to do that.

416
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:33,667
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also the advice I would give would pretty much be just fill out the form and mail it.

417
00:27:33,707 --> 00:27:36,057
Speaker 1: It's not hard That's that's my advice.

418
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:38,830
Speaker 0: but more especially to those of you who aren't u.s.

419
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:51,829
Speaker 0: Ian's I don't think you understand the sheer level of Incompetence ignorance stupidity poor planning Hysteria and just mass chaos that goes with paying taxes every year.

420
00:27:52,096 --> 00:28:00,950
Speaker 0: Yep Also how absolutely in crazily complicated taxes can be in the United States can be but don't have to be unless you do weird shit.

421
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:04,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, like own a house or go to school exactly.

422
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:10,315
Speaker 1: But actually if anyone is in another country in this episode, you know Maybe you should listen.

423
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:13,610
Speaker 1: just cuz it'll be interesting to hear how our taxes work and why we're crazy about them.

424
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:19,458
Speaker 1: But I want to hear how your taxes work cuz I really have no idea about Anyone else just like you probably have no idea about us.

425
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:20,964
Speaker 0: now very briefly.

426
00:28:20,984 --> 00:28:32,378
Speaker 0: The United States is Ostensibly a federalist system and I say ostensibly with the weight of ten years of anger On my part to only ten.

427
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:38,150
Speaker 0: Well because I wasn't aware of How I felt about that issue until I learned a lot more about it.

428
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:43,043
Speaker 0: Well into that but we have states and we have.

429
00:28:43,063 --> 00:28:43,404
Speaker 0: we have.

430
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:47,367
Speaker 0: we have towns - oh, yeah I'll talk about fucking Yonkers.

431
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:56,856
Speaker 1: We have towns states and the federal government itself and you have to pay taxes to all three of these Government bodies.

432
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,283
Speaker 0: Well, usually only two.

433
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,850
Speaker 0: that is why usually all the grace.

434
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,790
Speaker 0: But you see we Scott and I are residents of the city of Beacon.

435
00:29:04,332 --> 00:29:07,102
Speaker 0: We are also residents of the County Duchess.

436
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:09,390
Speaker 0: we are also residents of the state of New York.

437
00:29:09,771 --> 00:29:17,935
Speaker 0: we are also residents of the United States of America and that's about it and every piece along the way is semi autonomous.

438
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:33,390
Speaker 0: you see this it's changed over the years, but generally in the United States each state is on most matters an Entirely separate entity like its own tiny country and it can administer itself within certain guidelines.

439
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,241
Speaker 0: However, so it wants and some states are kind of weird.

440
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:41,622
Speaker 0: Yeah, I states different in many ways Yep and not just in the way people act but in the way the laws are.

441
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:46,465
Speaker 0: there are a lot of things that are legal in One state or illegal in another state or like we were talking about in the forums.

442
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:50,666
Speaker 0: in Michigan You can just go get a handgun license by filling out a form.

443
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:54,558
Speaker 0: in New York You can't get a gun in New York City.

444
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:57,647
Speaker 0: You double can't get a gun or like in Florida.

445
00:29:57,768 --> 00:30:02,245
Speaker 1: You can get Fireworks and in New York, you can get sparklers if you're lucky.

446
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:07,263
Speaker 0: Yep in Tennessee You can get what are effectively explosives and in Connecticut.

447
00:30:07,303 --> 00:30:08,186
Speaker 1: You can't get anything.

448
00:30:08,387 --> 00:30:12,770
Speaker 0: Yep in New York You can't even get those little snakes that don't do anything except start a small fire.

449
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, in some states you can buy alcohol anywhere at any time.

450
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:17,326
Speaker 1: in some states.

451
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:18,370
Speaker 1: You can't buy it on Sunday.

452
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:25,150
Speaker 0: You know I actually was a little bit chagrin once when I moved out of Michigan where it literally you just buy alcohol at the grocery store.

453
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:26,186
Speaker 0: You don't even think about it.

454
00:30:27,016 --> 00:30:28,250
Speaker 1: Liquor liquor at the grocery.

455
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,774
Speaker 1: So I went like hodak.

456
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:36,435
Speaker 0: so I went to a grocery store outside of the state once and I was like Where's the booze section?

457
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:39,989
Speaker 0: and the guy looked at me with this look of what the fuck is wrong with you?

458
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,402
Speaker 0: Yeah So the states are all different and all that and each state collects taxes.

459
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:56,360
Speaker 0: the federal government on top of that Collects its own taxes some of which goes to the states some of which goes to federal stuff some of which goes to Paying off the national debt.

460
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:57,850
Speaker 0: not gonna get into that either.

461
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,437
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk about where the money goes.

462
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:04,895
Speaker 1: you're not about how they take the money from you not how they use it Yep And also towns and cities.

463
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:12,799
Speaker 0: some of them take taxes and this is just the income tax the tax that is taken off of any wages Anyone makes in the United States?

464
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:20,630
Speaker 1: Yes, the way this works is a Technically, they could do an income tax where every year they come along and they say how much money did you make?

465
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:22,777
Speaker 1: Well, this is how much money we're going to take from you.

466
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:33,503
Speaker 1: and the problem with that is of course if I made say a Million dollars in a year, which I don't make anywhere close to that and they came along at the end of the year And they said all right, how much money did you make this year?

467
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:34,550
Speaker 1: And I'd say a million dollars.

468
00:31:35,012 --> 00:31:36,760
Speaker 1: They would say you owes two hundred thousand dollars.

469
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:38,670
Speaker 1: I'd be like, well I spent the million.

470
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:51,570
Speaker 1: So now I can't give you and that would be a big problem because pretty much everyone would spend all their money no one would have the enough left over to pay the tax and It would ruin the whole thing because they wouldn't have enough money to run the government.

471
00:31:51,592 --> 00:32:02,062
Speaker 0: Yes The thing you have to keep in your mind is that the majority of Americans don't understand how the taxes work for one two don't understand how to do them or file them.

472
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:09,684
Speaker 0: and three have no concept of Actually paying attention to what you spend money on or budgeting or anything.

473
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:11,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should use that SNL as a thing of the day.

474
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:12,489
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

475
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:15,633
Speaker 1: So the way it works is they have withholding.

476
00:32:15,974 --> 00:32:18,988
Speaker 1: you fill out a form whenever you get a job and you could change the.

477
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:21,830
Speaker 1: you know You can refill out the form almost any time you want.

478
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:32,610
Speaker 0: Basically, the government will take the amount of money that based on a very rough metric They think you are going to owe over the course of the year and they take it out bit by bit of each of your paychecks.

479
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:33,630
Speaker 0: You have to worry about it.

480
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:43,400
Speaker 1: So you can write on this form for instance the number zero which says okay government take out a crap ton of money from my Paycheck every month every paycheck cover.

481
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,350
Speaker 1: often you get paid and the government will take money Before it even gets into your hands.

482
00:32:48,611 --> 00:33:01,179
Speaker 1: Your employer is gonna pay you right whoever hires you to do your work and instead of giving you all the money in your salary They just give you most of it and they give another bit to the government and every paycheck They keep giving more to the government.

483
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,951
Speaker 1: the government holds on to it Yep.

484
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:07,510
Speaker 0: Now the problem here is that the way you determine unless you do it the complicated way.

485
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:09,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're gonna go real briefly over this.

486
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,141
Speaker 0: I don't want to get a lot simpler than what we're.

487
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:13,910
Speaker 0: the core course run now.

488
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:18,345
Speaker 0: But basically you tell the government about how much they should take out and they take that out.

489
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:19,650
Speaker 1: All right, no big deal.

490
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:25,390
Speaker 0: But if we're already paying it automatically, how come there's this big taxes time every year?

491
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:30,105
Speaker 0: The answer is the government always either takes too much or too little.

492
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:41,910
Speaker 0: and if they take too much Then you have to fill out a whole bunch of paperwork to get them to give the extra you paid back Mostly because the government isn't taking away from you the exact right amount.

493
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:51,626
Speaker 1: That's so difficult requires so much math to figure out the exact right amount The government should take from you and then if you get a raise or then if you do anything weird It's like such a pain in the ass.

494
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:56,389
Speaker 1: So you tell the government kind of how much to take away from you automatically and they take it and they hold on to it.

495
00:33:56,571 --> 00:34:02,005
Speaker 1: They invest it I hope wisely to get interest money on it and that's the government uses that to do stuff.

496
00:34:02,446 --> 00:34:15,536
Speaker 1: and then at once a year You actually sit down and do a bunch of math to figure out how much you know of all the things you did in the previous Year, you know from January to December how much should the government really have taken from you?

497
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:24,389
Speaker 1: and then you take that number and you take the amount of money that you actually Gave to them and you figure out whether you owe the government more money or whether they got to give you some money back.

498
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:25,898
Speaker 0: Now here's the best part.

499
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:32,210
Speaker 0: if they owe you a bunch of money You have to fill out all this paperwork and then they send it to you without any interest.

500
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,150
Speaker 0: So you basically you've lost out on the opportunity to use that money for other things.

501
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,165
Speaker 1: Yes, it's you don't want to get a lot of money back.

502
00:34:39,205 --> 00:34:41,156
Speaker 1: a lot of people like hooray I got a bunch of money back.

503
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:45,337
Speaker 1: Well because they're stupid that's cuz you're stupid if you gay You're basically let the government hold.

504
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:45,859
Speaker 1: Let's say I get $1,000.

505
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:48,469
Speaker 0: It's giving someone an interest-free loan.

506
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:55,371
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like that would be the same as if I lent rim $1,000 and then later he gave me back $1,000.

507
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:58,350
Speaker 1: Usually when you loan someone money they pay interest on it.

508
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:04,638
Speaker 1: So I would loan rim $1,000 and then when he paid it back a year later, he'd give me $1,100.

509
00:35:04,638 --> 00:35:06,910
Speaker 0: why Scott are you familiar with our stage usury laws?

510
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:12,672
Speaker 1: Not really Okay No,

511
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:28,230
Speaker 0: but if you don't pay enough if they don't take enough out then not only do you have to pay it all back At the end of the year But if you're off by more than a little bit and you owe more than some small amount of money They actually penalize you and make you pay a fine on top of that.

512
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:33,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, they will come and the worst is if you do anything wrong, they'll come and get you again.

513
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:41,274
Speaker 0: Yes in fact now you have to fill out all these forms and you have to keep everything you fill out for three years and any time during Those three years.

514
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:41,836
Speaker 0: the government.

515
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:46,596
Speaker 0: Well, not the government the IRS Not gonna get into that either.

516
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:47,178
Speaker 1: No, we're not.

517
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:55,890
Speaker 1: it's basically what it comes down to is every year You have to figure out on paper or using computers or somehow how much money you actually owe the government.

518
00:35:56,271 --> 00:36:02,498
Speaker 1: Then you have to either pay the government the money you didn't pay or they give back the money that they took extra Which you don't want either.

519
00:36:02,518 --> 00:36:06,986
Speaker 1: one of those you and if you had it, perfect You wouldn't owe them anything and they wouldn't know you know anything.

520
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:13,062
Speaker 0: if you had it Perfect, you would owe them the exact amount One cent short of having to pay a penalty.

521
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:14,107
Speaker 1: No, that's true.

522
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:19,359
Speaker 1: Yes But Yeah, then I forget where I was going right.

523
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:26,270
Speaker 1: if you mess up and you do this math wrong at all There's a chance that they might notice you did the math wrong.

524
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:29,250
Speaker 1: Usually you have to do it really wrong for them to be a problem.

525
00:36:29,351 --> 00:36:35,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, also if even if you do it wrong They're not gonna do much to you except fix it and amend how much money you owe or get back.

526
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:39,350
Speaker 1: But there is a chance that if you do it really wrong you could go to jail.

527
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:44,170
Speaker 1: You could be in serious shit for doing it wrong now or lying or anything like that.

528
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:52,140
Speaker 0: Luckily the vast majority of people who get audited by these sorts of checks and get in a lot of trouble Didn't just make an honest mistake.

529
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:58,765
Speaker 1: They were actively trying to scam Yes A lot of people you see because the government is nice and that they let you do this math.

530
00:36:58,865 --> 00:37:09,165
Speaker 1: instead of them doing the math For everyone and investigating your personal business They let you fill out the paperwork To tell them how much money you owe the government according to all the rules that they set

531
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:16,890
Speaker 0: for despite the fact that The numbers you put in are filed with the government anyway, so they already have a lot of this information.

532
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:20,809
Speaker 0: They just haven't put two and two together unless they really feel like doing so Yep.

533
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:37,105
Speaker 1: but yeah If you lie a lot on purpose or try to get out of it or try to get the government to give you back a Bunch of money where you actually owe them money or anything scammy or anything sleazy or anything like that They'll come after you and put you in jail and it kind of sucks.

534
00:37:37,406 --> 00:37:42,790
Speaker 0: now even better Talk about how we had to pay federal taxes to the government and state taxes to our state government.

535
00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:51,389
Speaker 0: Well, every state has its own tax laws and its own tax forms And they're all completely different from one another and completely different from the federal one

536
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:59,189
Speaker 1: Yep, so while everyone in the country does the same federal taxes with the same rules that change every year though But it's the same set of rules for everybody.

537
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:11,090
Speaker 1: Every state has a different set of rules as well and those rules change every year and you basically have to keep Taking this test every year to figure out something and it keeps changing.

538
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:24,130
Speaker 0: yeah, basically every year you go to the post office or if you're if I guess if you're on the government radar as being some Sort of productive citizen they'll mail you a gigantic book that tells you how to fill out your taxes.

539
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:29,895
Speaker 0: it's basically a textbook full of forms and full of instructions and It's a mess.

540
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:37,589
Speaker 1: and then it says like, you know, all right start here, you know Put this information here from the form that you got in the mail a few weeks ago.

541
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:45,480
Speaker 1: you know the and all the forms have names like w2 I 1040 something something and it's really.

542
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,190
Speaker 1: it's like they purposefully make it as obtuse as possible.

543
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,850
Speaker 1: They could just say, you know the name of the form like how much money you made form how much money you owe.

544
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:54,653
Speaker 0: Think of this.

545
00:38:55,054 --> 00:38:55,837
Speaker 0: they're they're like.

546
00:38:56,078 --> 00:39:08,701
Speaker 0: the worst part is not only that but it's some forms are optional some forms you can use if you want but they're not as good at getting you more money back and What it really comes down to is that you can do.

547
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:12,335
Speaker 0: the taxes are really really simple to do in this country Unless you're very rich.

548
00:39:12,857 --> 00:39:17,098
Speaker 1: all you have to have or doing something weird with your finances But all you besting.

549
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:22,446
Speaker 0: but even if you do stuff like that The only thing it takes out of you is time and intelligence.

550
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:26,370
Speaker 0: You have to sit down Read a bunch of instructions follow the instructions.

551
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:38,110
Speaker 0: If you just go through the book read everything put every number in and follow it from start to finish in the end Your taxes will be 100% right as long as you were smart enough to read the instruction and use the calculator.

552
00:39:38,471 --> 00:39:48,330
Speaker 0: The problem is the instructions are very long and very obtuse at least to the average American and a lot of people Honestly don't understand the instructions.

553
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:52,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's just because they shouldn't have graduated high school.

554
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:53,230
Speaker 0: and here's the best part.

555
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:59,950
Speaker 0: Generally not understanding the instructions or not knowing how to do the complex thing won't get you in trouble.

556
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:03,670
Speaker 0: In fact, it'll work just fine and they encourage you to use the simpler methods.

557
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:12,166
Speaker 0: But the simpler you go The less money you're gonna get back because now you're not filling out the forms to get the extra money The government technically owes you like.

558
00:40:12,206 --> 00:40:17,650
Speaker 0: for the federal There's the form you fill out in the United States for the federal government is the 1040.

559
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:24,995
Speaker 0: That's your main federal tax form and it's gigantic and long and the thing is the vast majority of it Doesn't apply to most people.

560
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:29,850
Speaker 1: they basically says hey, did you do this weird thing with some capital gains?

561
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,217
Speaker 1: No, did you do this weird thing?

562
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:33,381
Speaker 1: Did you buy like a boat?

563
00:40:33,462 --> 00:40:35,710
Speaker 1: No, did you do this weird thing?

564
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,281
Speaker 1: Did you invest in some company or buy a company?

565
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:40,390
Speaker 1: or or did you sell stock or something?

566
00:40:40,723 --> 00:40:44,290
Speaker 1: No And then you skip like big chunks at a time every time you say no.

567
00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:49,308
Speaker 0: So people they made a much simpler form called the 1040 a which you could fill out instead.

568
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:50,412
Speaker 0: now There's rules.

569
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:51,938
Speaker 0: some people aren't allowed to use that form.

570
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:56,114
Speaker 1: Just like there's also an easy form, which is really Oh God See they made.

571
00:40:56,335 --> 00:40:57,740
Speaker 1: are the anyone's allowed to use that?

572
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:58,222
Speaker 0: actually?

573
00:40:58,282 --> 00:40:59,708
Speaker 0: no most Americans qualify for that.

574
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:00,130
Speaker 0: Really?

575
00:41:00,411 --> 00:41:01,930
Speaker 1: I used to qualify for it, but not anymore.

576
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,014
Speaker 0: The only remember.

577
00:41:03,054 --> 00:41:03,375
Speaker 0: there's two.

578
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:07,210
Speaker 0: there's qualifications where if you don't meet them, you can't use the easy form.

579
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:12,490
Speaker 0: There's also a lot of times you could use the easy form, but you shouldn't cuz you'll lose a lot of money.

580
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:17,110
Speaker 1: Yep, I could only use the easy form when I was making chump change in college and high school.

581
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:18,477
Speaker 1: Yes, I got a real job.

582
00:41:18,798 --> 00:41:19,703
Speaker 1: I made too much money.

583
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,130
Speaker 1: I wasn't allowed to use the easy form anymore.

584
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:23,983
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never actually been able to use the easy.

585
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:25,550
Speaker 1: easy form is so easy.

586
00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:28,100
Speaker 1: It's like who cares if you're not getting the money back.

587
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:28,944
Speaker 1: It's so worth it.

588
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:35,150
Speaker 1: Just to have this one page God you write down how much money you made but basically like two things you're done.

589
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:35,411
Speaker 1: but

590
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:52,655
Speaker 0: the less apt or capable you are or the less you are able to do or just You are or lazy or any of that the simpler forms you go The more money you're gonna end up paying to the US government that actually you didn't really owe them or you won't get credits You were supposed to get or all sorts of things.

591
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:57,590
Speaker 0: basically you pay for laziness by not getting the most bang for your buck.

592
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,154
Speaker 1: Yeah, now there is a way around this.

593
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:04,630
Speaker 1: there are people who as a living they will prepare your taxes for you.

594
00:42:04,811 --> 00:42:07,250
Speaker 0: This is a many many million dollar industry.

595
00:42:07,571 --> 00:42:16,406
Speaker 1: Yes, the big names are like H&R block and TurboTax which is a computer Software where H&R block is a store that sort of.

596
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:20,750
Speaker 1: it's a temporary store Like they open up these stores in like April and then they close them after April.

597
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:37,810
Speaker 1: but you go there and you bring all your paperwork with you and someone else will fill out your taxes for you and supposedly they will fill them out in a way that gets you a lot more money back than you could figure out because they're experts and they know all the way to fill out taxes and they know the shit and You know for the most part.

598
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:41,670
Speaker 1: I guess they do fill out the taxes faster than you would because they know what they're doing.

599
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:46,422
Speaker 1: they've done it a thousand times and They might do it better than you because they know things that you don't know.

600
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,230
Speaker 1: but then they charge you money.

601
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:52,626
Speaker 1: So I could go and do it myself and maybe I'd get $200 back for the government.

602
00:42:54,092 --> 00:43:01,309
Speaker 1: I can go have them do it and I'll get $400 back from the government But then I'll have to give two hundred dollars to the guy who just filled out the forms for me.

603
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:03,781
Speaker 1: So you end up not making anything.

604
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:14,129
Speaker 0: see now my entire life I've always done my taxes entirely by myself even when I was well I didn't really have a job in high school, but right after high school when I got my first job I just right away sat down.

605
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:20,050
Speaker 0: Try the 1040 easy found out I couldn't use the 1040 easy because I cashed a bunch of bonds for college to buy a computer.

606
00:43:20,252 --> 00:43:25,566
Speaker 0: I used a 1040 a. Use the 1040 a the next year and the next year and now I fill out a regular 1040.

607
00:43:25,566 --> 00:43:36,150
Speaker 1: Yep I just in high school and like the days I said I used the 1040 easy Which is really easy and I just didn't care because that's the amount of money was so small.

608
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:37,749
Speaker 0: Now here's the best part about all this.

609
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:49,330
Speaker 0: most Americans wait until pretty much the day before to suddenly decide to do their taxes and Actually, all the post offices are usually open on the tax deadline until midnight.

610
00:43:49,691 --> 00:44:01,752
Speaker 0: yeah, and you like you'll try to go to a post office on the day taxes are due and there'll be an infinite number of people there and Mailboxes will fill up like you'll go to a mailbox in the street and it'll be full Thing.

611
00:44:01,812 --> 00:44:11,359
Speaker 1: I can't blame people for mailing it at the last second because let's say you can do your taxes in January if you want Which I did him in February March I don't remember but let's say the gut.

612
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:14,250
Speaker 1: I owe the government a hundred dollars extra this year, right?

613
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,314
Speaker 1: Because I didn't pay enough.

614
00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:17,786
Speaker 1: They didn't take enough out of my paycheck.

615
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,026
Speaker 1: I If I file in January, I'm gonna owe them $100 in January.

616
00:44:23,146 --> 00:44:24,150
Speaker 1: You got to pay right away.

617
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,016
Speaker 1: I have to send a check with the forms.

618
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:30,732
Speaker 1: if I wait until the last second then the government holds on to my money for Less time.

619
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:31,275
Speaker 1: so it's better.

620
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:35,130
Speaker 1: that doesn't excuse you doing the math at the last second.

621
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:37,421
Speaker 1: You could do the math as soon as the year is over.

622
00:44:37,461 --> 00:44:38,647
Speaker 1: the math isn't gonna change.

623
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:46,010
Speaker 1: So Mailing it on the last day I can't blame people for that because you should mail it at the last possible second if you owe the government money.

624
00:44:46,131 --> 00:44:50,350
Speaker 0: Actually, what I usually do is I file my federal return real early because they always owe me a bunch of money.

625
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:56,490
Speaker 1: I guess no matter what I owe you money You want to send it as soon as possible to get that money back as soon as possible.

626
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,849
Speaker 0: Well, the feds always just screw up and take too much no matter what I do.

627
00:44:59,271 --> 00:45:03,328
Speaker 0: But the state of New York is spot-on and every year I'm within like five or ten dollars.

628
00:45:03,348 --> 00:45:03,870
Speaker 0: New York State.

629
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,483
Speaker 1: Only eight owed me 80 bucks this year, which is the most ever like last year.

630
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:09,109
Speaker 1: They owed me like 50 cents.

631
00:45:09,229 --> 00:45:09,490
Speaker 0: this year.

632
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:15,293
Speaker 0: they owed me $24, however, that was because one and Fucking Yonkers.

633
00:45:15,634 --> 00:45:27,934
Speaker 0: So when I first moved to New York, I had to fill out this crazy stupid long form for New York State taxes and it was doubly complicated because I had also had a job in Michigan that year and Michigan didn't care.

634
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:29,380
Speaker 0: So Michigan was easy to deal with.

635
00:45:29,741 --> 00:45:31,850
Speaker 0: New York was like you worked in another state.

636
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,377
Speaker 0: Well, good luck.

637
00:45:33,578 --> 00:45:35,788
Speaker 0: fill out this and this and this and this and this and this and this.

638
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:38,089
Speaker 0: you asshole How dare you work in another state?

639
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:43,270
Speaker 0: But there was this whole section where one it was like if you were a resident of New York City.

640
00:45:43,793 --> 00:45:45,059
Speaker 0: Oh my god extra paperwork.

641
00:45:45,501 --> 00:45:46,466
Speaker 0: All right, I expect that.

642
00:45:46,486 --> 00:45:50,510
Speaker 0: New York City, you know But the best city in the world with crazy number of people there.

643
00:45:51,473 --> 00:46:03,081
Speaker 0: If you live in Yonkers all this crazy stuff and I thought Yonkers and then said if you work in Yonkers But do not live in Yonkers If you work in Yonkers and live in Yonkers what?

644
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:06,170
Speaker 0: and then I know I just always laughed like a Yonkers.

645
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,083
Speaker 0: Haha, that's a funny name for a place.

646
00:46:08,123 --> 00:46:09,069
Speaker 0: and while they have weird taxes.

647
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:16,847
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't really think about it until tax time this year, but the new job I got my office is in Yonkers.

648
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:27,903
Speaker 0: Oh I just that totally didn't even think about it until I sat down to do my taxes and I was like But up it up it up it up it up working Yonkers and I'm about to put zero.

649
00:46:27,924 --> 00:46:29,469
Speaker 0: and then I think oh fuck.

650
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:34,659
Speaker 0: But so with the Yonkers tax it was dead.

651
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,026
Speaker 0: even I owed New York State nothing.

652
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:38,770
Speaker 0: It was like a five cent thing.

653
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:39,515
Speaker 0: It was perfect.

654
00:46:39,636 --> 00:46:41,710
Speaker 0: I had done it right for the first time ever.

655
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:50,115
Speaker 0: I was perfectly set and then I noticed that there's a credit if you make less than like a hundred thousand Dollars in Yonkers.

656
00:46:50,536 --> 00:47:00,827
Speaker 0: and I qualified for it because I'm a man and an adult and I have a job and all that business Mm-hmm, and the credit was just enough to get me like 20 bucks back.

657
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:08,570
Speaker 0: All right Yeah, yeah Yonkers charges like this point something percent tax on any money anyone makes in the city if they don't live there.

658
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,783
Speaker 1: Yep, unlike rim I do my taxes with software instead of doing it on paper.

659
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:18,488
Speaker 1: just because I don't do anything on paper I avoid paper at basically every possible turn.

660
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:23,064
Speaker 0: The reason I use paper is really stupid and I'm not going to use paper next year.

661
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:24,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I feel dumb.

662
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,590
Speaker 0: So I'm not even gonna bother telling you guys why I do it the long hand way.

663
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:30,939
Speaker 1: It's some reason that you won't be able to defend.

664
00:47:31,461 --> 00:47:32,806
Speaker 0: Oh, no, no, no, no, I can defend it.

665
00:47:33,047 --> 00:47:33,710
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

666
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:37,970
Speaker 0: I e-filed online with with all the online stuff for free.

667
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:45,910
Speaker 0: But I did it when I was at RIT and then the next year I thought alright I'm gonna e-file again and I went in and basically to e-file again.

668
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:52,590
Speaker 0: I had to have a few exact numbers from certain fields from my previous e-filing.

669
00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:55,492
Speaker 1: You know if you forget those there's still ways you can go I know.

670
00:47:55,753 --> 00:48:03,043
Speaker 0: but that year I waited until the last minute and by then it was too late and the paperwork I would have had to fill out to be able to e-file.

671
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:05,412
Speaker 0: I couldn't do it in time I wasn't worth it.

672
00:48:05,432 --> 00:48:10,867
Speaker 0: So I do it longhand and then I stashed the paper somewhere forgot about him lost him the next year.

673
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,892
Speaker 0: this year E-file.

674
00:48:13,193 --> 00:48:13,755
Speaker 0: ah crap.

675
00:48:14,176 --> 00:48:16,281
Speaker 0: I still don't have the numbers and I waited too long.

676
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:18,106
Speaker 0: God damn it this year.

677
00:48:18,126 --> 00:48:19,470
Speaker 0: I got the fucking papers.

678
00:48:19,712 --> 00:48:21,322
Speaker 0: They're sitting in my file folder.

679
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:22,510
Speaker 0: I'm ready for next year.

680
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:28,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, see when I e-file I always at the end when it says print out the stuff I print out the stuff and then I keep it.

681
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:33,030
Speaker 1: and then next year when it says hey Do you remember these numbers I go back to the printout from last year and there they are.

682
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:36,310
Speaker 0: I just hate keeping records and I tend to throw things away right away.

683
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,546
Speaker 1: I still need to get a file cabinet because I right now have just a pile of papers.

684
00:48:39,566 --> 00:48:40,290
Speaker 1: That's not too good.

685
00:48:40,732 --> 00:48:41,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, I need to go through that.

686
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,410
Speaker 0: my file cabinet is slowly becoming disorganized.

687
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:49,690
Speaker 1: But yeah, when you do it online, it's a lot I guess easier on the brain even though it's not the best.

688
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:52,450
Speaker 1: What you do is first you have to find a website to do it.

689
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:59,810
Speaker 1: There are a bunch of websites to do it at and I do TurboTax because I trust it more than the others even though I don't like the company and I think they're evil.

690
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:03,806
Speaker 1: But well, I know that they're not gonna fuck me and I know that it's gonna work and it's not.

691
00:49:03,826 --> 00:49:06,200
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get screwed I have a bone to pick.

692
00:49:06,563 --> 00:49:07,389
Speaker 0: Yeah about that.

693
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:17,050
Speaker 0: now I'm gonna go over this issue very briefly But here is an example for all of you foreigners out there all of you non citizens of the proud and wonderful United States of America.

694
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:27,900
Speaker 0: You see the IRS and you do taxes through this organization called the IRS the Internal Revenue Service and They set up e-file where you can file electronically.

695
00:49:28,342 --> 00:49:30,890
Speaker 0: because one they save a lot of money.

696
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:35,183
Speaker 0: so basically our tax dollars become more efficient if they do it electronically.

697
00:49:35,203 --> 00:49:41,939
Speaker 1: because now is the IRS costs money to run and The more money we spend running the IRS That basically tax money is lost.

698
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,188
Speaker 0: this saves money because now there's no way.

699
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,079
Speaker 0: I mean You don't have to hire people to sit there.

700
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,529
Speaker 0: look at some assholes handwritten form.

701
00:49:49,971 --> 00:49:52,963
Speaker 0: Figure out whether that's a four or a nine and type it all in.

702
00:49:52,984 --> 00:49:54,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't have to print as many books You don't know.

703
00:49:55,052 --> 00:49:57,401
Speaker 1: it saves a lot of money to do things electronically.

704
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:05,770
Speaker 0: So alright, the government obviously says well It has to be free to e-file because otherwise that that's not cool and all this business.

705
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,746
Speaker 0: so alright, the IRS is gonna set up a way where you can just e-file and it'll be great.

706
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:29,830
Speaker 0: the Companies that do taxes for people made a big stink and lobbied and basically forced the government Because the government can't compete with private industry Even though this private industry exists solely Because of a required thing that all American citizens have to do to interface with their governments.

707
00:50:30,151 --> 00:50:37,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, they basically got it set up that the IRS is not allowed to let you e-file with them directly for free.

708
00:50:38,312 --> 00:50:41,107
Speaker 0: Instead you have to go to one of these companies.

709
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:53,290
Speaker 0: now the agreement was that alright these companies have to offer a Free way of e-filing and these companies hide that fucker as best they can in like the bottom back corner of their website.

710
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:57,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, if some of them don't link to it at all that some of them I swear to God.

711
00:50:57,611 --> 00:50:58,475
Speaker 0: They have a website.

712
00:50:58,696 --> 00:51:01,410
Speaker 0: you can pay for them to do your taxes and do it online.

713
00:51:01,831 --> 00:51:06,705
Speaker 0: You have to find the website they have up that is not linked to by them anywhere.

714
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:08,470
Speaker 0: that lets you do it the freeway.

715
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:10,679
Speaker 1: Yes, for example, you go to TurboTax.com.

716
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,741
Speaker 1: TurboTax.com says hey you want to file your taxes TurboTax You can spend 10 bucks to get this.

717
00:51:15,761 --> 00:51:17,510
Speaker 1: you can spend 30 bucks and we'll do it even better.

718
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,619
Speaker 1: You can spend 50 bucks and we'll do it the best we can.

719
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:20,222
Speaker 1: hallelujah.

720
00:51:20,623 --> 00:51:27,445
Speaker 1: If you go to the IRS website There's a link there to TurboTax in the back door of TurboTax.

721
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:30,536
Speaker 1: that lets you use TurboTax for free Because they have to.

722
00:51:30,817 --> 00:51:30,978
Speaker 1: that's.

723
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:33,430
Speaker 1: the only way to do it is to go in the secret back door.

724
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:38,197
Speaker 1: If you end up paying money to use TurboTax You're a fool because you didn't have to.

725
00:51:38,658 --> 00:51:43,130
Speaker 0: now the other great thing is that there's no such rule for the state taxes.

726
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:49,587
Speaker 0: So every place they'll do your federal taxes, then they say you want to do your state taxes with us to only 20 bucks.

727
00:51:51,432 --> 00:52:12,371
Speaker 1: Yep, and the thing is I ended up actually having to pay to do the state taxes because some places will do the state taxes For free and but they have rules like we'll do this state tax for New York for free if you make less than X dollars Or we'll do these states, Connecticut California, Kentucky, Ohio for free if you make less than $30,000.

728
00:52:12,371 --> 00:52:19,210
Speaker 1: so depending on how much you make and where you live you might be able to do your state taxes or free online somewhere.

729
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:23,061
Speaker 1: But I Now make enough money where I can't.

730
00:52:23,161 --> 00:52:26,256
Speaker 1: so I had to pay money to do the state taxes online And I just said fuck it.

731
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:26,879
Speaker 1: I just paid.

732
00:52:26,899 --> 00:52:27,664
Speaker 1: it was 20 bucks.

733
00:52:27,704 --> 00:52:28,508
Speaker 0: big deal thing is.

734
00:52:28,568 --> 00:52:31,378
Speaker 0: next year I'm probably gonna pay because I I'm not.

735
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:39,123
Speaker 0: it's not that hard to do your taxes and all the people who panic about it I think are just lazy or Not that bright when you do ever.

736
00:52:39,546 --> 00:52:47,070
Speaker 0: however New York state taxes are so Stupidly obtuse it just it sucks to do them.

737
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:47,854
Speaker 0: It is painful.

738
00:52:47,895 --> 00:52:58,070
Speaker 1: That's the reason I do it online because when you do it online all it Does is hey it asks you a question in almost plain English, and if you're unless you're an idiot You don't know anything about your own finances, which case you have a problem?

739
00:52:59,231 --> 00:52:59,332
Speaker 1: It's.

740
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:03,660
Speaker 1: it's easy to answer all these questions Yes or no most of them and the ones that aren't yes or no.

741
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,011
Speaker 1: we're like type in your name type in how much money you Made.

742
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,550
Speaker 1: you just go down the list and it keeps asking you questions one after another.

743
00:53:10,072 --> 00:53:13,590
Speaker 1: It asks you so many questions though it takes like 90 minutes to do the whole thing.

744
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:16,058
Speaker 1: But when you're done it says okay, you're done.

745
00:53:16,078 --> 00:53:16,861
Speaker 1: It's not much money.

746
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:17,483
Speaker 1: click.

747
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:19,129
Speaker 1: Okay type in your credit card number.

748
00:53:19,149 --> 00:53:22,910
Speaker 0: now Here's the thing that got me when I first II filed way back, and I thought it was great.

749
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:23,890
Speaker 0: So I did my federal taxes.

750
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,373
Speaker 0: It was free.

751
00:53:24,775 --> 00:53:25,941
Speaker 0: and then it comes up with the state tax.

752
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:33,486
Speaker 0: it says you want to pay 20 bucks to do the state And I said you know what fuck you I'll do the state ones in paper, so I said no and then it popped up another window.

753
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:38,770
Speaker 0: that said warning Many states will not accept or will blah blah blah.

754
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:52,849
Speaker 0: And it basically said that if I II file federal and try to file state paper That it'll mess up my taxes and I'll have trouble down the road which as far as I can tell is as close to a lie as they can legally get.

755
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:55,439
Speaker 0: and That infuriated me.

756
00:53:55,459 --> 00:53:57,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty much a lie.

757
00:53:57,353 --> 00:54:07,126
Speaker 0: I saw through it but I think a lot of people wouldn't because it comes on with an air of authority and you Wouldn't think that people would lie outright about something like that.

758
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:07,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good thing.

759
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:09,482
Speaker 1: My friend's dad is a tax lawyer.

760
00:54:09,502 --> 00:54:15,048
Speaker 1: if I actually saw that message I would have called him up and been like hey hey, and he would have been like huh, huh?

761
00:54:15,831 --> 00:54:25,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, luckily for the first time in a long time I didn't have to do anything complicated for my taxes So I didn't have to worry not like when we moved and I had to deal with all those Moving things to get money back.

762
00:54:26,072 --> 00:54:31,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, what it comes down to is you know you can take your standard deduction Or you can itemize your deduction don't?

763
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:32,749
Speaker 0: we're not gonna get into I know.

764
00:54:33,251 --> 00:54:39,087
Speaker 0: Basically you can either take a default value for a lot of things or you can figure it out manually.

765
00:54:39,368 --> 00:54:46,688
Speaker 0: and figuring it out Manually can save you a lot of money But it's very hard to do and you have to keep records of every goddamn thing you do all year.

766
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:53,790
Speaker 1: the other thing is Even if I figured it out manually I know the answer to figuring it out manually is less than the default value.

767
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:59,570
Speaker 1: So I always take the default value until I do something weird where that'll make my manual answer increase.

768
00:54:59,893 --> 00:55:01,330
Speaker 0: I've actually done it manually twice.

769
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:05,404
Speaker 1: I mean I do try to do it manually but it like very quickly.

770
00:55:05,545 --> 00:55:11,826
Speaker 1: as soon as I do all the big-ticket items It's like oh, I'm there's no way I'm gonna beat the default number and I stop and I just go with the default.

771
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:14,536
Speaker 1: yeah You just check it every year to make sure.

772
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:15,098
Speaker 0: now.

773
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:18,007
Speaker 0: We're talking about the income tax now.

774
00:55:18,047 --> 00:55:23,870
Speaker 0: remember that in America We also have sales taxes property taxes gas taxes that are separate.

775
00:55:24,131 --> 00:55:25,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, well sales taxes.

776
00:55:25,376 --> 00:55:28,349
Speaker 1: basically whenever you buy something you that price goes up.

777
00:55:28,813 --> 00:55:31,592
Speaker 1: So like in New York State's like 8% tax I think we pay.

778
00:55:31,612 --> 00:55:33,721
Speaker 1: I don't even know if I buy something.

779
00:55:33,821 --> 00:55:36,190
Speaker 1: if I buy a hundred dollar video game that doesn't exist.

780
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,182
Speaker 1: There's no hundred dollar video game, but all right.

781
00:55:38,222 --> 00:55:39,630
Speaker 0: Let's say I buy OGO all right.

782
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:43,143
Speaker 1: Let's say I buy two fifty dollar video games at the video game store.

783
00:55:43,204 --> 00:55:47,597
Speaker 1: right the guy will say 108 dollars, please That's the sales tag.

784
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:50,170
Speaker 0: now the thing is the sales taxes are almost always state taxes.

785
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,380
Speaker 0: And here's the fun bit that relates to the internet.

786
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:53,465
Speaker 1: every state is different.

787
00:55:53,485 --> 00:55:54,530
Speaker 1: sales tax go, Delaware.

788
00:55:55,014 --> 00:55:59,139
Speaker 0: Not only is every state different in that regard But there is an idea called a use tax.

789
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:08,330
Speaker 0: and basically in America if I live in New York Let's say I buy a computer online, and they don't charge the sales tax online because they're not in New York.

790
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:09,630
Speaker 0: They don't want to deal with New York's boy.

791
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:12,337
Speaker 1: I bought a computer from some computer company.

792
00:56:12,417 --> 00:56:20,521
Speaker 0: if I don't on my own keep track of every single thing I buy Online where sales tax was not charged for New York.

793
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:22,848
Speaker 0: I have to report that and pay a use tax on it.

794
00:56:23,189 --> 00:56:24,493
Speaker 0: furthermore It's not just online.

795
00:56:25,035 --> 00:56:29,287
Speaker 0: say I drive or I'm on a road trip, and I pass through.

796
00:56:29,307 --> 00:56:36,926
Speaker 0: I don't know Delaware, Pennsylvania And in Pennsylvania I buy something and then I bring it back to New York and use it.

797
00:56:37,267 --> 00:56:40,984
Speaker 0: in many cases I have to report that and pay a use tax on it technically.

798
00:56:41,286 --> 00:56:51,067
Speaker 0: furthermore in Men in some cases if you go to a different county in the same state and buy like clothes there You have to report that.

799
00:56:52,892 --> 00:56:56,230
Speaker 0: It's such a bullshit thing and it's so complicated and stupid.

800
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:01,150
Speaker 0: But the government is your friend like the computer and the government wants to help you and make it easy.

801
00:57:01,572 --> 00:57:17,210
Speaker 0: so the option is either keep track of it all and based on all your receipts and everything report the exact amount you owe or There's a handy-dandy chart you can look at to guess what you should owe and it's probably more than what you do.

802
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:20,929
Speaker 0: But you're always safe picking that option as opposed to doing it.

803
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:24,150
Speaker 1: man You always pick that option because it's always less than what I do.

804
00:57:24,351 --> 00:57:26,370
Speaker 1: Oh because I buy a lot of shit online.

805
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:26,932
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

806
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:29,860
Speaker 0: if it's actually less then you can get audited and fucked.

807
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:35,036
Speaker 1: I know I know but whatever yeah It's basically a hey.

808
00:57:35,337 --> 00:57:43,110
Speaker 0: if you pay us 20 to a hundred dollars depending on how much money you make and all these other factors You're a lot less likely to get audited on all that shit you bought on the Internet.

809
00:57:43,312 --> 00:57:45,530
Speaker 1: The thing is I'm not actually sure if it's less or not.

810
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,199
Speaker 1: I've never actually bothered to figure it out.

811
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:49,090
Speaker 1: The thing is I just keep paying the estimate every year.

812
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:49,672
Speaker 0: I'll be honest.

813
00:57:49,773 --> 00:57:53,770
Speaker 0: I pay the estimate because I don't want to get in trouble and - I honestly don't keep track.

814
00:57:53,872 --> 00:57:54,769
Speaker 0: I'm not trying to scam.

815
00:57:55,275 --> 00:58:06,224
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna keep track of every single thing I buy for a year and whether or not I bought it on a site in New York and whether or Not sales tax was paid and to what state it was paid and what I'm supposed to owe.

816
00:58:06,264 --> 00:58:07,910
Speaker 0: and it's I'm not gonna do that.

817
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:10,018
Speaker 1: Yeah I think that's entirely unreasonable.

818
00:58:10,078 --> 00:58:20,064
Speaker 1: to expect anyone to keep track of everything they buy Every and where the things they buy and how much tax they paid on it That's just completely unreasonable and I refuse to do it no matter what.

819
00:58:20,104 --> 00:58:23,741
Speaker 1: if they come after me for it I'm just gonna do some Gandhi action on them.

820
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:25,730
Speaker 0: We'll have a great show if that ever happens.

821
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:29,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, Delaware is a great state because they don't charge sales tax.

822
00:58:30,172 --> 00:58:36,159
Speaker 1: So you can just go to Delaware by TV and if you ignore the use tax You can just bring it back to whatever state you live in.

823
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,616
Speaker 1: and you know two video games in Delaware cost $100.

824
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:43,540
Speaker 1: all right, we've got $0.99 in Delaware and you give them a dollar.

825
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,724
Speaker 1: they give you one penny back.

826
00:58:44,885 --> 00:58:46,170
Speaker 0: We've gone on long enough.

827
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:48,960
Speaker 0: I think yeah, that was entirely incoherent and rambling.

828
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,409
Speaker 0: We didn't really have a point a moral a lesson or anything.

829
00:58:51,912 --> 00:58:53,702
Speaker 1: We think well, I think the point is stupid.

830
00:58:53,723 --> 00:58:58,168
Speaker 0: people don't know how to use taxes But they still suck to do even if you're smart.

831
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:03,389
Speaker 1: People in other countries now understand how American taxes kind of work barely sort of.

832
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:07,502
Speaker 0: no All they understand is that it's a frustrating and complicated process that sucks.

833
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:10,170
