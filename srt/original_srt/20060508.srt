1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,240
Speaker 1: It's Monday, May 8th, one day before E3, I guess E3 already started, whatever.

2
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:23,980
Speaker 1: This is Geek Nights, and today we're gonna talk about P2P, but really we're just kind of rushed through it, so we can hurry up and talk about E3 tomorrow.

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,737
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,602
Speaker 1: Tomorrow is the first full day of the Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2006.

5
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,539
Speaker 1: It's actually started right now.

6
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:46,035
Speaker 1: That means all the video game news in the entire universe is going to come out within the next 24 to 36 hours.

7
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:56,540
Speaker 1: It's already begun, you can go to dig, but while I'm saying this, which is probably hours or perhaps even a day before you're listening...

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,000
Speaker 0: It is currently 9.37 PM in Rim and Ska time.

9
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,088
Speaker 1: Eastern, so it's 6.30 in California, where the E3 2006 is happening.

10
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:15,900
Speaker 1: Already we're seeing such reports as microphones and speakers in the Wii controller.

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,059
Speaker 0: Yup, various Final Fantasy bits.

12
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:25,459
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy XIII, two different Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles games, I think the Square Enix conference must be going on.

13
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,780
Speaker 1: But it's getting really crazy up in here.

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,800
Speaker 1: WarioWare, there's a Time Magazine article of someone who played the Wii.

15
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,970
Speaker 1: WarioWare Wii, everybody.

16
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:37,480
Speaker 1: WarioWare Wii.

17
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:40,779
Speaker 1: It's only going to get crazier.

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,980
Speaker 1: Tomorrow, the episode of Geek Nights you will listen to will have nothing but E3 stuff.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,277
Speaker 1: Even the things of the day and the news, all the E3.

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,039
Speaker 0: Yup, and while we're not going to be at E3 actually covering it...

21
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,778
Speaker 1: Because we suck.

22
00:01:54,281 --> 00:02:00,760
Speaker 0: I can say with a fair amount of certainty that at least by the next E3, there's a decent chance we'll be there.

23
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,295
Speaker 1: Maybe.

24
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,318
Speaker 0: We'll pull it off.

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing about E3 is that you don't really need to go because there's even a website now that's up.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,379
Speaker 1: It's a BitTorrent tracker that is hosting only torrents, which are videos and audios of things going on in E3.

27
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,773
Speaker 1: And all the videos are in HD.

28
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:19,339
Speaker 0: So you can really see that nerd.

29
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:31,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only thing you have to gain by going to E3 as opposed to just watching E3 on the internet or satellite feed... Is actually playing all these games a few months before they hit the shelves.

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,680
Speaker 0: Well, and the general fun of being at a con.

31
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course it's crazy crowd- it's not a con, it's more of a trade show.

32
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,658
Speaker 1: Yeah, but- That's the thing.

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,180
Speaker 0: Most people who seem to go and have a good time are the ones who go to the crazy after parties.

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,639
Speaker 0: And during parties.

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,880
Speaker 1: The thing is, it seems like every single group that goes has their own separate party.

36
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:53,080
Speaker 1: It's like I go to four or five different video game websites, and they all have their own separate party.

37
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,636
Speaker 1: It's like, "We're having the E3 get drunk

38
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:56,119
Speaker 1: party!".

39
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,435
Speaker 1: "We're having the E3 get even more drunk

40
00:02:58,516 --> 00:02:58,959
Speaker 1: party!".

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,202
Speaker 0: "Woooo!".

42
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,558
Speaker 1: You know?

43
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,676
Speaker 1: I don't know.

44
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,800
Speaker 1: So, let's refrain from talking about E3 anymore today.

45
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:07,720
Speaker 0: Yes.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,619
Speaker 0: Though in other more horrible news, the trees in the Mid-Hudson Valley have decided to lay down a bombardment upon my nose...

47
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:23,900
Speaker 1: I have been laid upon the same bombardment, yet I am immune, for I am superior genetically in all ways.

48
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,344
Speaker 1: Yeah.

49
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,860
Speaker 0: Well, I have this Maisonneau line of allergies.

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,280
Speaker 1: So they just walked around through Belgium, is what you're saying?

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically.

52
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,379
Speaker 1: Way to go, Belgium!

53
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,560
Speaker 0: I've got so much Benadryl and Sudafed and various other things that I had to sign little logbooks for to get that it's not even funny.

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,319
Speaker 0: And I've got a headache, and my nose hurts.

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a druggie.

56
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,020
Speaker 1: Some leaving his pills around the bathroom.

57
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:45,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, that, uh, loratadine.

58
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just, we don't have a phone, so I can't call for help.

59
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,640
Speaker 1: So anyone who has a phone, just call, like, the drug whatever line and tell them that Rym is a big addict and needs to go to rehab.

60
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,980
Speaker 0: Though also today, I actually had a doctor's appointment for that new job.

61
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,798
Speaker 0: 'Cause I quit IBM.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,700
Speaker 0: I'm not, I'm just kinda screwing around at work now for the last two weeks.

63
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I screwed around at work today.

64
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,160
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm doing more work now that I've told them I quit than I was doing before.

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,465
Speaker 1: Lol.

66
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,658
Speaker 0: As they start panicking and asking me things like, "How do we do all that stuff you've been doing for the last three

67
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:14,939
Speaker 0: years?".

68
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:15,820
Speaker 1: Lol.

69
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,700
Speaker 0: Though at least, I drove down to the city, 'cause I have to get tested for tuberculosis as part of the fact that I'm gonna be working in hospitals.

70
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,400
Speaker 0: And I've got a little ball on my arm now that's full of tuberculin.

71
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:30,120
Speaker 0: And as long as it doesn't turn big and red, I get the job.

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,514
Speaker 1: I'm gonna take this red marker tonight and go...

73
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:40,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then I'll go in, you know, 48 hours from now, and the doctor will say, "You've got a bad case of

74
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,100
Speaker 0: Sharpie.".

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:41,823
Speaker 1: Lol.

76
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:44,520
Speaker 1: Awesome.

77
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,340
Speaker 0: Though, interestingly enough, when I got to the city, my allergies disappeared.

78
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:48,819
Speaker 0: I felt great.

79
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,079
Speaker 1: 'Cause there's no trees there.

80
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,220
Speaker 0: Oh, there are, just not whatever bastard tree lives up here.

81
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,180
Speaker 1: Oh, there are, just aren't enough trees there.

82
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:58,139
Speaker 0: Oh, well, anyway, we got some actual news, too.

83
00:04:58,886 --> 00:04:59,157
Speaker 1: Okay.

84
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:00,798
Speaker 1: So, Vim.

85
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,495
Speaker 1: V-I-M.

86
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:05,360
Speaker 0: The only text editor that real men use.

87
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, and not talking about the underwear company or anything like that.

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,640
Speaker 1: 'Cause I think there's an underwear company named Vim, isn't there?

89
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:13,880
Speaker 0: There's also an underwear company named RIM.

90
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:14,716
Speaker 1: Yup.

91
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,119
Speaker 0: They make pretty cool designer boxers.

92
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:18,759
Speaker 1: Alright, we're gonna forget about RIM.

93
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,000
Speaker 1: Vim is the V-I-enhance, whatever, text editor.

94
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,200
Speaker 1: It's a very, very important piece of software, whether you know about it or not.

95
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:30,494
Speaker 0: Yes.

96
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,727
Speaker 0: Even, not in terms of history, but in terms of usefulness.

97
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:40,478
Speaker 0: now, you're guaranteed, no matter what Linux, Unix, whatever system you're on, V-I is in there if nothing else is.

98
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,440
Speaker 1: Yup, no matter which computer in the entire universe you are using, be it-- Well, if it's a Unix, Linux, BSD.

99
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, any Unix, Linux, whatever computer in the world has V-I or V-I-M on it.

100
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,396
Speaker 1: I guarantee it.

101
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,020
Speaker 1: Windows and, I don't know if Macs might have it pre-installed, but if they don't, you can install it.

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,140
Speaker 1: Vim will work on any computer, anywhere.

103
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:09,400
Speaker 1: It's completely free and completely available, and it works the same no matter what system you're using, guaranteed.

104
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,804
Speaker 0: We've talked about it before.

105
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:12,331
Speaker 0: It's incredibly powerful.

106
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,500
Speaker 0: It is, however, some would say, obtuse.

107
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,014
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not easy to learn, but it's easy to use.

108
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:19,300
Speaker 1: Once you've learned it, you're awesome.

109
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:20,032
Speaker 0: Escape colon WQ.

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, we definitely had this discussion before.

111
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:22,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

112
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,618
Speaker 1: There's an easy to use and easy to learn.

113
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,160
Speaker 1: Vim is the not easy to learn, but easy to use text editor.

114
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:30,200
Speaker 1: All it does is edit text files.

115
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,599
Speaker 0: But it edits them real well.

116
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,052
Speaker 1: And usually, it just edits source code for programming.

117
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,120
Speaker 1: That's its primary function.

118
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,639
Speaker 1: A secondary function is system administrating configuration files, which it does equally well.

119
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:45,348
Speaker 1: Vim 7 came out today.

120
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,684
Speaker 1: Previously, we were using Vim 6.

121
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:52,560
Speaker 1: Vim 7 is light years beyond Vim 6.

122
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,479
Speaker 1: Now, to someone who doesn't use Vim, you would open up Vim 7 and say, "This looks exactly the goddamn same

123
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:58,680
Speaker 1: thing.".

124
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,724
Speaker 0: Wait, it looks the same.

125
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:04,000
Speaker 0: It's a big black screen with a little colon in the bottom left and a blinking cursor somewhere.

126
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,965
Speaker 1: And that's how you know.

127
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:07,940
Speaker 1: they didn't fuck it up when they switched to version 7.

128
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,700
Speaker 1: Because it didn't change a goddamn thing.

129
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,940
Speaker 1: What they did add are the following.

130
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,440
Speaker 1: Number one, on-the-fly spell checking, all Microsoft Word style.

131
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:18,740
Speaker 0: Ooh, that's something I've actually kind of wanted.

132
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, because Vim didn't have a spell checker, so you would occasionally try to write things in it and screw up.

133
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:26,780
Speaker 1: And it sucked ass because there's no way to spell check.

134
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:32,160
Speaker 0: Well, you could spell check by, you know, piping things through something, but not easily.

135
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,799
Speaker 0: Not in a way that non-nerds would know how to do.

136
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,860
Speaker 1: A canal is capable of printing multibyte text, so now you can Vim in Chinese, and Japanese, and Kanji, and Russian.

137
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,000
Speaker 0: Yep, the net result of that is that they've added, I think, 50 languages.

138
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,380
Speaker 1: They actually translated the manual pages into all those languages as well.

139
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:52,159
Speaker 0: Whoa, badass.

140
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:58,100
Speaker 1: And there's an internal grep, which is faster than the previous internal grep.

141
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:01,340
Speaker 1: And it is portable, so it works on every machine.

142
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,455
Speaker 0: Now you might wonder, why do I care if grep is fast or slow?

143
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:05,200
Speaker 0: It's the text editor.

144
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,439
Speaker 0: There are some big fucking text files out there.

145
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,380
Speaker 1: And if you want to grep them, it could take you minutes to grep them.

146
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,826
Speaker 1: If you know what grepping is.

147
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,617
Speaker 1: If you don't know what grepping is, what are you listening to?

148
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,572
Speaker 0: Well, I guess, ctrl-f-ing.

149
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,098
Speaker 1: F3-ing.

150
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,043
Speaker 1: Ooh.

151
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:24,160
Speaker 1: No, it's actually forward slash regular expression forward slashing.

152
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,488
Speaker 1: Yeah.

153
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:35,840
Speaker 1: Or, if you're awesome, g slash regular expression slash s slash slash regular expression slash g.

154
00:08:38,273 --> 00:08:38,438
Speaker 0: Okay.

155
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:39,740
Speaker 1: R. Okay.

156
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, Vim is awesome and it got more awesome.

157
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:44,100
Speaker 1: Yep.

158
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,833
Speaker 1: The last thing they added, you know how Visual Studio does that thing.

159
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:54,220
Speaker 1: where, you know, you'll do like, you'll be typing some code and you'll do something like something dot whatever.

160
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,759
Speaker 1: And then this big list will appear and you can just choose something out of the list.

161
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:01,159
Speaker 1: It knows all the functions and you can just pick them instead of having to type them.

162
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,696
Speaker 1: Vim has that now.

163
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,290
Speaker 0: For what languages?

164
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:04,860
Speaker 0: All of them?

165
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:06,031
Speaker 1: A lot of them.

166
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:06,619
Speaker 1: All the big ones.

167
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,698
Speaker 0: All the ones we care about.

168
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:11,218
Speaker 1: C, Java, Ruby, Python, you know.

169
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:13,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, Python's what I really need.

170
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:13,600
Speaker 0: Yeah.

171
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,460
Speaker 0: Because I like Python and I use it, but I don't remember much about it.

172
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,920
Speaker 0: Because I only use it to replace things that are obtuse to do in Bash.

173
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:26,540
Speaker 1: This is really helpful for someone like me because I know the syntax and use of a lot of languages.

174
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,199
Speaker 1: Like, I know the basic structures of a language and what type of language it is and how to use it.

175
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,000
Speaker 1: But I don't remember, like, the actual specific names of the built-in standard functions of a language.

176
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,560
Speaker 1: Or the, you know, like in Ruby, I know how to use a block to do a certain thing.

177
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:51,960
Speaker 1: I don't remember the actual name of the function that, like, cuts off the spaces at the end of a string.

178
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,640
Speaker 0: But you know the function exists.

179
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,129
Speaker 1: Yep.

180
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,137
Speaker 1: So this can help me find it because I can, like, be like, "Was it 'chop' or was it 'chomp' or was it

181
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:00,819
Speaker 1: 'schomp'?"?

182
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,818
Speaker 1: You know, and I can try to type it in to see, you know, and I'll find it.

183
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,740
Speaker 0: Now, I guess, I mean, the news we just gave, you either cared about this and said "woot" or you have no idea what we just said.

184
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:16,860
Speaker 1: If you cared about this and said "woot," you are an awesome programming nerd of computer-ing.

185
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,360
Speaker 1: If you did not, then you're not so awesome.

186
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:26,040
Speaker 0: Nah, nah, if you didn't, because, I mean, a lot of people don't, and I'll admit that I never used VI or Vim until I got to RIT.

187
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,059
Speaker 1: I don't even know what it was before I got to RIT.

188
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,660
Speaker 0: I used to use, I had Pico that I had used occasionally on, like, this crapo Linux box.

189
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,260
Speaker 1: No, when I got to RIT, they told me about Vim, but they had, they told all the first year CS guys to use Emacs, which I used.

190
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:46,960
Speaker 1: I didn't like it, so I used NEdit, which is a lot more like Notepad, but it had better colors and stuff.

191
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,020
Speaker 1: So then I used NEdit for a long time, and NEdit's actually a lot better now than it used to be, and it's still kind of nice.

192
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,580
Speaker 1: I kind of, you know, but then once I really got into using Vim, now it's like everything else is just whatever.

193
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, when I was a freshman, they said "use Pico, VI is there, but that's for advanced people,".

194
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:06,456
Speaker 0: and I thought, "Well, I don't know what either of those is, really, so I'm just going to use

195
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:06,556
Speaker 0: VI.".

196
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,679
Speaker 0: And it was tough, but then I learned it, and I realized how awesome it was.

197
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,934
Speaker 1: Yep, once you learn, you know, important letters to press, like O, and Y, and D, and S.

198
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,020
Speaker 0: Though, if you're, if you, I mean, I highly recommend anyone out there learn to use VI, at least minimally.

199
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:44,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems to be that a lot of people who try to use VI once, and they realize it takes a lot of learning, you'll see them post comments on, like, Digg and Slashdot, like, "If you don't want to spend the two years it takes to learn VI, just use, like, my awesome editor, SubethaEdit," which is, I guess is cool, I never actually used it, but a lot of people say good things about it.

200
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,019
Speaker 1: Or they'll be like, "Yeah, if you don't want to bother learning all this crazy useless crap, then do

201
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:50,240
Speaker 1: this.".

202
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,900
Speaker 1: And then the other kind of posts are like, "Here are all the commands, oh my god, here's how to do that in one, you know, by pressing three

203
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,060
Speaker 1: buttons.".

204
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:01,040
Speaker 0: The way to learn VI, or anything complicated like that, is to learn the basics.

205
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,660
Speaker 0: Be able to make a little quick file, and then save it, and then delete it, and that sort of thing.

206
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,532
Speaker 0: Then, every time you're using VI, and you think, "Man, it'd be great if I could just do blah,".

207
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:14,940
Speaker 0: stop, look up how to do blah, and then do it.

208
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,880
Speaker 0: And you'll remember it, and you'll learn stuff real quick that way.

209
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,058
Speaker 1: Yep, and a lot of people will be like, "Oh man, it takes, like, three years to learn

210
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:22,159
Speaker 1: VI.".

211
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,735
Speaker 1: "It takes, like, a week to learn VI, unless you're a

212
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:25,279
Speaker 1: doofus.".

213
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:27,920
Speaker 1: Well, it takes years-- You just have to actually do it.

214
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,860
Speaker 0: It takes years to learn all the crazy tricks.

215
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,960
Speaker 1: I don't learn all the crazy tricks, I just learn the ones that I actually use.

216
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,860
Speaker 1: The ones that you don't use on a regular basis, just look 'em up.

217
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:44,940
Speaker 0: I mean, all I really use on a regular basis, other than the basic basic basics, are, like, I do some substitutions, and, you know, find and replace type stuff.

218
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:47,920
Speaker 0: Or copy pasting, or yank put.

219
00:12:49,282 --> 00:13:10,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, just remember that whenever you're in, like, a notepad, or the next time you're doing something with text editing or word processing, and you have to, like, copy and paste something, like, a billion times, and then edit, like, a little tiny bit on each line, just think, if you were using VI, and you bothered to learn it, you could probably do that by pushing, like, five keys on your keyboard, and pressing enter.

220
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:12,237
Speaker 1: Just so you know.

221
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:21,779
Speaker 0: Plus, if you know VI at all, you'll never be in the situation of, "Oh, I gotta fix my box, but I can't load X, and I don't have anything that edits text except that VI

222
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:22,040
Speaker 0: thing.".

223
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember how you said VI is on every computer there is, or at least every Unix computer?

224
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:44,220
Speaker 1: It's 'cause other word processes aren't, so if you're an Emacs guy, Emacs is kinda big and eh, you know, and if you don't learn how to use VI at all, you might one day be having to fix a configuration file on some Unix machine, and it doesn't have Emacs, or NEdit, or Pico, or Nano, or anything, but it'll have VI.

225
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,780
Speaker 0: Of course, I had to fix the Unix machine once, where VI, I couldn't even get to work properly, because I didn't even know what terminal to set up.

226
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:52,600
Speaker 1: Wow.

227
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,659
Speaker 0: 'Cause it was this Unix machine, and it didn't use VT- But it had VI, though.

228
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,559
Speaker 0: It had VI in it.

229
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,220
Speaker 1: Oh, there you go, same, the thing is, you know.

230
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,040
Speaker 0: I couldn't even make the arrow keys work, I had to use JK and all that.

231
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,098
Speaker 1: So even if VI is not your editor of choice, learn VI.

232
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,839
Speaker 1: I know that VIM is infinitely better than VI, but some old-ass computers only have VI.

233
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,319
Speaker 0: Now usually on a computer, if you type VI, it'll actually just run VIM.

234
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:16,100
Speaker 0: Yep.

235
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,619
Speaker 0: Very few people actually have VI.

236
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,519
Speaker 1: New modern computers that you're likely to use, that's the case, and what we're talking about here is VIM7.

237
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,800
Speaker 1: Not Vim, not VI, VI is kinda dead.

238
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:27,258
Speaker 1: No one likes it.

239
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:27,977
Speaker 0: Rightfully so.

240
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,677
Speaker 0: Rightfully so.

241
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:35,800
Speaker 0: Alright, so HP and Dell and Lenovo have decided to do something stupid yet again.

242
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,275
Speaker 0: Great.

243
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:48,560
Speaker 0: They have decided that, you know, DVI and the UDI or HDMI and VGA and that other one, all those standards of hooking monitors up to computers, they're all no good.

244
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,299
Speaker 0: They're gonna make a new one.

245
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,316
Speaker 1: What's wrong with DVI?

246
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,939
Speaker 0: DVI isn't as DRMed as they'd like it to be.

247
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,836
Speaker 1: It doesn't have any DRM.

248
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,319
Speaker 0: And they claim that DVI doesn't have enough bandwidth.

249
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,660
Speaker 1: DVI can have like a hajillion resolution with perfect.

250
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:13,300
Speaker 0: Actually, DVI does max out at 1920 by something unless you use DVI-B, which actually a lot of cards don't support.

251
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,200
Speaker 1: The best digital TV in the world doesn't go that high.

252
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:19,579
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, but if you have a crazy monitor or something.

253
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,400
Speaker 1: And people with crazy monitors get those things with the two DVI cables coming out.

254
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,540
Speaker 0: Keep in mind, I'm just playing devil's advocate here, I'm just saying what they say.

255
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:33,960
Speaker 0: Now the advantage of DisplayPort, which is what they're calling this bullshit, is that it's somewhat backward compatible with all those other standards.

256
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:35,152
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good.

257
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,215
Speaker 0: At least with DVI.

258
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:36,977
Speaker 1: That's good.

259
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,180
Speaker 0: But, you know, it has the DRM, and they say it has so much more bandwidth, it has almost not more bandwidth.

260
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,499
Speaker 0: It like barely edges DVI out.

261
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:48,980
Speaker 0: Uh, alright.

262
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,919
Speaker 0: But they're gonna make it standard on all their new PCs.

263
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,620
Speaker 1: Okay.

264
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:54,400
Speaker 0: I don't know what they're trying to accomplish.

265
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:02,719
Speaker 0: It's like, every time a format that has DRM in it fails, they make another worse format, assuming that somehow this one will succeed.

266
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,640
Speaker 1: Didn't they notice that Apple is the one winning the music?

267
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:15,420
Speaker 1: See, they were actually talking about this on some other podcast today, how Apple has DRM and so do all the other music stores online, right?

268
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:21,779
Speaker 1: But the Apple DRM is really, they're like, "Okay, how can we put DRM without the customer ever

269
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,160
Speaker 1: noticing?".

270
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:31,280
Speaker 1: And if you don't know this DRM, and you don't try to do something like copy music, you know, badly, the Apple DRM will never, you'll never see it and it'll never get in your way.

271
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,240
Speaker 1: All the other guys, the people who made that, didn't care about the customers, they cared about the record companies.

272
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:41,040
Speaker 1: So that DRM just gets all in your way all over the place.

273
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I got this little Sony recorder bit that I use to do interviews now at cons.

274
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:58,559
Speaker 0: It's great, except for the fact that it has such horrible shit DRM, that the only way to get the files off of it is to boot it, boot my computer into Windows, run this horrible application that then gets the encrypted data off of this thing.

275
00:16:59,646 --> 00:16:59,858
Speaker 1: Wow.

276
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:02,160
Speaker 0: In a crippled format, nonetheless.

277
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,740
Speaker 1: So now here's the thing, I can understand how you want to plug up the analog hole, right?

278
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:11,619
Speaker 1: That's a good thing, I guess, from a DRM, if you're an evil bastard.

279
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:16,260
Speaker 0: Except the analog hole really means, guess what, I have eyes, I can see it.

280
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,819
Speaker 0: If I can see it, I can record it, fuck you.

281
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:25,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, but here's the thing, who the hell right now is ripping movies by plugging in recorders to the DVI port?

282
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,980
Speaker 1: They're not, because they've broken the DRM before that point.

283
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:39,100
Speaker 1: You know, you're making a DRM where no one's bothering to go, assuming that your other DRM is like rock solid or will be rock solid.

284
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,500
Speaker 1: It never will be, ever.

285
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:46,940
Speaker 0: What I think their plan here is, that currently people have broken the first stage, the software-y DRM.

286
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,760
Speaker 0: But they haven't really gone after the hardware so much, because they haven't had to.

287
00:17:51,240 --> 00:18:02,320
Speaker 0: I think they want to get good hardware DRM out there and ubiquitous, and keep putting it out there so that when they finally make DRM that's harder to break, suddenly we're backed into a corner.

288
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:04,820
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's going to work, but I think that's what they're thinking.

289
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:11,777
Speaker 1: It's never going to work, DRM will never, there will never ever ever be a DRM that hackers will not break if they want to.

290
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:12,780
Speaker 1: Ever.

291
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:22,960
Speaker 0: I mean, even if there were a magical quantum thing that could make actual DRM, you still have to output it to some form of analog, because you have speakers.

292
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,345
Speaker 0: Speakers make sound.

293
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,740
Speaker 0: If anything, I put a microphone in front of that speaker.

294
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,407
Speaker 0: You can't stop that.

295
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,131
Speaker 1: Ever.

296
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:30,600
Speaker 0: Ever ever ever ever ever.

297
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,066
Speaker 0: Why don't they get it?

298
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:34,576
Speaker 0: The analog hole is just that, it's a hole.

299
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:35,700
Speaker 0: It can't ever be filled.

300
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,779
Speaker 0: They can just pump money into it, but it's still a hole.

301
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:46,139
Speaker 1: I think like the way Cory Doctorow says it, is DRM is a security where you give someone a goodie, but you put the goodie in a safe and you give them the key.

302
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,280
Speaker 1: But you kind of make it so that they can only open the safe, kinda.

303
00:18:52,161 --> 00:19:02,080
Speaker 1: It's like if you give someone a goodie in a safe and you give them the key, because you have to, or else you're not actually giving them the goodie, they're going to open it and get it out of there no matter what you want.

304
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,060
Speaker 0: I just think of that penny arcade with the ham sandwiches in the Safeway.

305
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,355
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

306
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:14,848
Speaker 0: Thing of the day.

307
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:16,930
Speaker 1: Thing of the day.

308
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:24,250
Speaker 0: Alright, so my thing of the day, I discovered this today actually, even though I had other things lined up for thing of the day over the weekend.

309
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:26,649
Speaker 1: Oh, we get a lot of things of the day.

310
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,430
Speaker 0: I already have my thing of the day for tomorrow, but this is horrifying and hideous.

311
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:40,890
Speaker 0: It's someone made a Super Soaker-like device, only instead of being shaped like a squirt gun, it's shaped like a giant alien penis-looking thing.

312
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,310
Speaker 1: Wait, what?

313
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:45,049
Speaker 0: It looks like an alien's phallus.

314
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,610
Speaker 1: Wait, so it's a Super Soaker.

315
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:53,610
Speaker 0: It looks like some sort of alien-type phallus instrument of depositing semen into unwilling human hosts.

316
00:19:53,790 --> 00:20:00,090
Speaker 1: So there's a Super Soaker that is shaped and designed like the penis of an alien.

317
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:02,750
Speaker 0: Now, that alone would not be so bad.

318
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,170
Speaker 0: I mean, alright, a cylinder is phallic.

319
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,370
Speaker 0: I mean, I can see a thousand things in my room that are in some way phallic.

320
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,610
Speaker 1: This microphone I'm holding right up to my face.

321
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:17,790
Speaker 0: When I'm up in front of this room, does it look like I'm talking into a bunch of robot penises?

322
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:23,210
Speaker 0: Alright, no Family Guy jokes.

323
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,829
Speaker 0: So, in addition...

324
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:26,990
Speaker 1: Can I conduct with my penis?

325
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,430
Speaker 0: To it being shaped like a penis.

326
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,589
Speaker 1: Can I podcast with my penis?

327
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:31,027
Speaker 0: You go right at it.

328
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:32,928
Speaker 0: You know what it shoots?

329
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,590
Speaker 0: It doesn't shoot water.

330
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,948
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up.

331
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,108
Speaker 1: How can you... It says on every Super Soaker ever, "Do not put anything in here that is not

332
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:42,410
Speaker 1: water.".

333
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:44,510
Speaker 0: Oh, this one doesn't shoot water on principle.

334
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:53,230
Speaker 0: In fact, the ad that is linked to in my Thing of the Day shows you that it in fact shoots a slimy liquid of some kind.

335
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,330
Speaker 1: Wait, how the hell does it do that without clogging up the works?

336
00:20:56,653 --> 00:20:57,268
Speaker 0: It's designed to.

337
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,448
Speaker 0: It shoots some sort of goop.

338
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:03,070
Speaker 0: It shoots a small stream of goop that flies out and covers things in goop.

339
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,809
Speaker 1: Coming out of an alien phallus.

340
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:10,088
Speaker 0: Now, the kicker is that the advertisement shows this one kid like, "Oh,

341
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:10,630
Speaker 0: right!".

342
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,829
Speaker 0: And he's holding this thing and he pumps it a bunch of times.

343
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:15,428
Speaker 0: And then he starts shooting it.

344
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:20,650
Speaker 0: And it cuts two shots of little children.

345
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:20,987
Speaker 0: Shots?

346
00:21:22,212 --> 00:21:24,205
Speaker 0: Like, holding their hands up like,

347
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:24,466
Speaker 0: "Ahh!".

348
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:27,930
Speaker 0: And then this goop hits them all over the face, bukkake style.

349
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:30,601
Speaker 1: And then he pumps it up more and shoots out more.

350
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:32,288
Speaker 1: goop up from the alien phallus.

351
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,125
Speaker 0: Oh my god!

352
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:36,549
Speaker 0: It just doesn't get worse.

353
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:37,568
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

354
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:41,730
Speaker 0: I only see one possibility.

355
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,768
Speaker 0: Normally I say, "Oh, I

356
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,850
Speaker 0: see.".

357
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:43,830
Speaker 1: I know the possibility.

358
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,790
Speaker 1: What's that company that makes the Super Soaker?

359
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,430
Speaker 1: What's it called?

360
00:21:47,174 --> 00:21:47,909
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't remember.

361
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:49,950
Speaker 1: I forget the name of the company.

362
00:21:50,011 --> 00:21:50,609
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

363
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,589
Speaker 1: The people working for that company and designing Super Soakers, you know what they are?

364
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,770
Speaker 1: Pedophiles of the bukkake fetti.

365
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:58,939
Speaker 0: As they are.

366
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,510
Speaker 0: What I could envision is a designer who is angry at his job decided, "You know what?

367
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,161
Speaker 0: Here's an idea for a toy,

368
00:22:06,182 --> 00:22:06,889
Speaker 0: bastards.".

369
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:09,888
Speaker 0: And the clueless executive said, "Alright,

370
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:10,150
Speaker 0: fine."

371
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:10,541
Speaker 0: And made it.

372
00:22:12,112 --> 00:22:13,610
Speaker 0: I can't imagine any other scenario.

373
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:21,205
Speaker 0: I can't imagine a human being on this earth over the age of nine who would not see that and think, "That's a penis shooting semen at

374
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:21,508
Speaker 0: people.".

375
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:28,290
Speaker 1: You pump it and then it shoots goop and it's an alien palace.

376
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,586
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

377
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,950
Speaker 0: It kind of reminds me of that Viking toy.

378
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,950
Speaker 0: You know how SNL used to always have those fake ads for fake toys or fake things like Super Happy Fun Ball?

379
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:37,629
Speaker 1: I guess.

380
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,769
Speaker 0: There was an ad once for this Viking thing.

381
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:41,218
Speaker 0: And they showed it like.

382
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,689
Speaker 0: they put it in the living room and they turned it on.

383
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,849
Speaker 0: And it's a Viking that basically just sprays red dye around the room.

384
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:53,449
Speaker 0: What parent would let their kid play with this?

385
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:54,424
Speaker 1: I don't know.

386
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,510
Speaker 0: Though I used to have a squirt gun that shot disappearing ink.

387
00:22:58,191 --> 00:22:58,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are cool.

388
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, until you ran out of the ink and then you couldn't buy anymore because the toy was already taken off the market.

389
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:03,606
Speaker 0: That sucks.

390
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,329
Speaker 0: That was awesome.

391
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:04,841
Speaker 1: Yeah.

392
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,690
Speaker 0: So do you have a thing of the day?

393
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:07,268
Speaker 0: I sure do.

394
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,410
Speaker 0: Does it involve pedophilia bukkake?

395
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,708
Speaker 1: No, it involves violence.

396
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,369
Speaker 1: Ultraviolence.

397
00:23:13,212 --> 00:23:21,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, so on Japanese TV, there was a video of this guy riding down a mountain on a bicycle.

398
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,810
Speaker 0: Like downhill mountain biking?

399
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:24,830
Speaker 1: No, it was a really weird mountain.

400
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,070
Speaker 1: Like I think it was a volcano.

401
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,210
Speaker 1: Except it was really smooth.

402
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,390
Speaker 1: Like if you wanted to go really, really fast, there's no better place than this.

403
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,990
Speaker 1: A perfectly smooth downhill kind of dirt.

404
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,270
Speaker 1: You get a lot of nice traction.

405
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:46,845
Speaker 1: And this guy was on a bike and he went down the hill and they recorded his speed at like 168 kilometers an hour at one point.

406
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,970
Speaker 1: I was like holy shit, right?

407
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:53,109
Speaker 1: And then I guess he slowly stopped after that.

408
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,709
Speaker 0: Well, I can see that.

409
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:02,170
Speaker 0: I mean, biking down the meager hills that existed in Michigan when I was a kid, I once got my bike up to about 50 miles an hour.

410
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:13,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the next thing they show is this guy who's wearing this red suit with a helmet and he's all fancy-like and he's got a really fancy looking bike.

411
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,955
Speaker 1: Like he's prepared to do this.

412
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,890
Speaker 1: Like he's going to break a world record in how fast his bike is going to go downhill.

413
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, like he was in this fancy kind of looking bike too.

414
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, really fancy.

415
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:25,610
Speaker 1: The kind that has like three plastic spokes in the wheels.

416
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, like an actual downhill bike as opposed to the first guy who was just on some mountain bike.

417
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,016
Speaker 1: Yeah.

418
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:33,038
Speaker 1: The guy looks pretty buff too.

419
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:34,886
Speaker 1: Like he's like grrr, I'm going to go get this.

420
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:35,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, awesome.

421
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,329
Speaker 0: Alright, Steve-O!

422
00:24:37,714 --> 00:24:38,007
Speaker 1: Steve-O!

423
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,779
Speaker 1: So he starts going.

424
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,589
Speaker 1: He's going pretty fast.

425
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,865
Speaker 1: Whoosh, whoosh.

426
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:48,950
Speaker 1: He gets to a certain point and then the frame of the bike just collapses.

427
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:56,410
Speaker 1: Like the front wheel goes up and the part where the pedals are goes down.

428
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:59,579
Speaker 0: Man, that's like a fear I've had as a child.

429
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:03,330
Speaker 0: I was always densely afraid of the fact that my front fork would suddenly break and I'd be killed by the bike.

430
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,616
Speaker 1: This wasn't the fork, it was behind the fork.

431
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:10,570
Speaker 1: It was like where the fork, you know, reaches the handlebars like right in there.

432
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:12,009
Speaker 1: It just went right in half.

433
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:13,990
Speaker 0: That's a little too close to my balls.

434
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,414
Speaker 1: It was way close to his balls.

435
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:20,470
Speaker 1: So the guy, of course, flips over forward like a bajillion times.

436
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:25,290
Speaker 1: And well, just watch the video and you'll see just how injured this guy gets.

437
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:33,250
Speaker 1: He turns from a pretty dangerous looking dude, turns into an old, beat the shit out of old man in like a second.

438
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:35,690
Speaker 0: I think the worst part is when his helmet flies off.

439
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,887
Speaker 0: And you see that, wow, he's still, oh, ooh, oh.

440
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,558
Speaker 1: And you see like parts of the bike I think hit him at the beginning.

441
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,645
Speaker 1: Oh, painful to watch.

442
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:46,450
Speaker 1: Even more painful to be that guy.

443
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,250
Speaker 1: He didn't die, but oh god, it's painful.

444
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:57,110
Speaker 1: So if you would like to watch people in pain, I don't know, I don't like to watch it, but it's just so... It's like watching a train wreck.

445
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,615
Speaker 0: You know what it's like?

446
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:01,490
Speaker 0: It's like watching those owned compilations on Google Video.

447
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,434
Speaker 1: Exactly.

448
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:03,889
Speaker 1: This is the ultimate owned.

449
00:26:06,952 --> 00:26:09,109
Speaker 1: It's more owned than any of the owns I've ever seen.

450
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,756
Speaker 0: I guess that is the difference.

451
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:12,609
Speaker 0: I mean, look, this is a Japanese TV thing, right?

452
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,410
Speaker 0: The guy got hurt and the cameras kept rolling and then they showed the horrible aftermath.

453
00:26:17,551 --> 00:26:19,989
Speaker 0: Wow, look, look at the consequences of what you decided to do.

454
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:26,150
Speaker 0: Anytime in America when they're filming some sort of stunt and it goes wrong, they don't show you the aftermath.

455
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,189
Speaker 0: They show you like a panned back shot of paramedics and that's it.

456
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:30,569
Speaker 1: If you're lucky.

457
00:26:31,654 --> 00:26:32,249
Speaker 0: If you're lucky.

458
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:38,510
Speaker 0: I don't know, I guess it speaks well that, yeah, if something bad happens, at least report on it or choke it.

459
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,350
Speaker 0: Hey, don't try this at home, you'll die.

460
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:47,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, if they make a show about someone jumping over ten school buses on a motorcycle and they mess up, that show doesn't actually ever make it to the air.

461
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,927
Speaker 1: You'll just see like a news story about it.

462
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:56,469
Speaker 1: It's when the guy, you know, so when you watch a show on some channel about some stunt, the guy always succeeds every time.

463
00:26:58,251 --> 00:27:00,729
Speaker 0: Well, unless it's a Fox show, World's Blankiest Blank.

464
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:03,268
Speaker 1: World's Blankiest Blank.

465
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:12,790
Speaker 1: We're going to do today's show on the history and whatnot of P2P file sharing thingies.

466
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:21,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, a few people have asked about it and all the other topics you've asked about, we kind of went long in the news, so we don't want to spend a short episode on something big.

467
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:29,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not going to get too technical into exactly how they work or how you can use them or copyright or anything like that.

468
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:35,183
Speaker 1: We're just going to talk about the history of P2P usage in general, the major networks, etc.

469
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:45,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, because basically the two of us, we're from the generation that lived through the dawn of the MP3 age, like directly.

470
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,910
Speaker 0: We got some of the first MP3s and we were along at every step of the way.

471
00:27:50,990 --> 00:28:03,170
Speaker 0: And it startled me one day when someone at my work was talking about Napster and they had no idea that Napster used to be the thing, because they've only known Napster as that crappy Napster what it is today.

472
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:03,855
Speaker 1: Really?

473
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,010
Speaker 1: Wow, that wasn't until recently.

474
00:28:05,492 --> 00:28:09,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, people who really weren't hip with it, or people who were young, or people who didn't care, don't really know.

475
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:10,669
Speaker 0: And it's kind of fascinating.

476
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,410
Speaker 1: But it was all over the news back in the day when it was for real.

477
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,070
Speaker 0: They didn't know what it was, or they didn't pay attention.

478
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,770
Speaker 1: Okay, well, in the beginning there was two things.

479
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,050
Speaker 0: Well, in the beginning there was MIDI.

480
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:25,395
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

481
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,540
Speaker 1: MIDI files were the beginning.

482
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,907
Speaker 1: You could get them from websites, and Usenets, and IRCs, and FTPs.

483
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,875
Speaker 1: That was the beginning of those four things.

484
00:28:37,036 --> 00:28:40,667
Speaker 1: Usenet, IRC, FTP, websites.

485
00:28:40,907 --> 00:28:41,730
Speaker 1: One, two, three, four.

486
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:49,430
Speaker 0: Now, before Napster and peer-to-peer and all that, basically the only way to get MP3s, which were this elite thing.

487
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,628
Speaker 0: I mean, they were, in that day, like Where's was in the late 80s, early 90s.

488
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,430
Speaker 0: It was the thing that people would collect and seek out, and parter over, and fight with, and it was fun.

489
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, there would be trades.

490
00:29:01,594 --> 00:29:06,564
Speaker 1: They'd be like, "Hey, I'll wait the 20 minutes it takes to send this to you.

491
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:08,869
Speaker 1: if you wait the 20 minutes it takes to send that to

492
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:09,009
Speaker 1: me.".

493
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:17,290
Speaker 0: Or there were just blatant FTP sites where you'd log in, and they had ratios where for every 10 megabytes you uploaded, you were allowed to download one megabyte.

494
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:25,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of IRC channels would have bots in them, and you could send files to the bots, and then they would send you things back.

495
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,980
Speaker 0: And of course there were the MP3 sites, which would have thousands of links.

496
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:33,970
Speaker 0: Maybe five of them would work, but you'd click on every goddamn one.

497
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,709
Speaker 0: You didn't care what the song was, you'd download it.

498
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,650
Speaker 1: That's right.

499
00:29:38,094 --> 00:29:39,989
Speaker 0: I got some shitty music because of that.

500
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:48,070
Speaker 1: I think I got one song that way, ever, because I just didn't care, and then I forgot to, what, you had to burn it or something?

501
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,082
Speaker 0: Oh, you had to uh...

502
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,014
Speaker 1: Scrape it?

503
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:50,947
Speaker 1: What was the word?

504
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,820
Speaker 0: It was MP3 cooked.

505
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,027
Speaker 0: You had to uncook MP3s.

506
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:54,819
Speaker 1: Yup.

507
00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:02,550
Speaker 0: Because back then, no one, no web server was set up to let you download MP3s, binary files.

508
00:30:03,153 --> 00:30:06,290
Speaker 0: So it wouldn't know mime types, it would just download ASCII.

509
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:13,770
Speaker 0: So you'd get an MP3, you'd go to play it, and instead of music coming out, the godawful screeches of the damned would come out of your speakers.

510
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:14,945
Speaker 1: Yup, yup.

511
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:20,610
Speaker 1: The only way to fix it was- And Winamp would use your 100% CPU usage on your 486.

512
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,191
Speaker 0: Yup, yup.

513
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:29,530
Speaker 0: Or because you had an ISA sound card and an ISA network card, you couldn't play MP3s and download websites at the same time.

514
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:29,980
Speaker 0: Yup.

515
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:32,970
Speaker 0: But one day, Napster appeared.

516
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,949
Speaker 1: Napster was god.

517
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,410
Speaker 0: Now when it first appeared, there was about a two week period where I didn't know anything about it.

518
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,718
Speaker 0: Like I heard of it, and I thought it was something stupid.

519
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:44,910
Speaker 0: I thought it was like MP3 sites, but for the masses.

520
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,370
Speaker 1: I heard the word Napster, I didn't know what it was, one day eventually I got around to using it, and holy crap.

521
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:59,209
Speaker 0: Well one day in high school, this girl was sitting there and she said, "Napster is great, but half the songs I get don't sound right and it takes forever to download

522
00:30:59,229 --> 00:30:59,350
Speaker 0: them.".

523
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:01,882
Speaker 0: And I said, "Why are you using Napster?

524
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:02,847
Speaker 0: Just go to FTP

525
00:31:02,887 --> 00:31:03,209
Speaker 0: sites.".

526
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:05,541
Speaker 0: Then I got home and I thought,

527
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:06,186
Speaker 0: "Huh.".

528
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,730
Speaker 0: So I went on Yahoo, because back then that was what you searched with.

529
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,759
Speaker 1: There was no Google then.

530
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:11,687
Speaker 1: No Google.

531
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,629
Speaker 0: I typed "Napster" and I saw this website, and I wasn't sure what to make of it.

532
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:20,890
Speaker 1: Well, there was this protocol that they invented called OpenNAP.

533
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,869
Speaker 1: Well, I don't think it was called OpenNAP.

534
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:24,301
Speaker 0: It was called Napster.

535
00:31:24,402 --> 00:31:25,210
Speaker 1: It was called Napster.

536
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:25,666
Speaker 1: Something like that.

537
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,830
Speaker 1: Basically what it was, is you would run a server, which is a Napster server.

538
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:34,570
Speaker 1: So it was still sort of a client server deal, which is how they were able to shut it down in the first place.

539
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:41,210
Speaker 1: And the server had an IRC, and it let you chat with other people, and it let you send files to other people.

540
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:46,467
Speaker 1: And you could say, "These are the files that I am sharing," or, "These are the directories I am

541
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:46,908
Speaker 1: sharing.".

542
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:56,150
Speaker 1: And people could search, and based on file names they could come up with files that other people were sharing, and directly download them from other people.

543
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:04,385
Speaker 1: And you could say, "I will allow X people to download from me at once," and, "I will allow one person to download these many things from me at a

544
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:04,987
Speaker 1: time.".

545
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:09,470
Speaker 0: Now, it was very primitive compared to the peer-to-peer you're used to today.

546
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,530
Speaker 1: Very primitive.

547
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,076
Speaker 0: You had to do everything manually.

548
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,310
Speaker 0: You'd find ten people who had the file you wanted.

549
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,710
Speaker 0: You picked the guy who was probably the fastest.

550
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,518
Speaker 1: And you couldn't just say, "Get from

551
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:19,881
Speaker 1: everyone."

552
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:20,446
Speaker 1: You picked one guy.

553
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,070
Speaker 0: Now, searching was great, because most stuff was on there, unless you listened to any good music.

554
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,371
Speaker 1: Well, no.

555
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:34,329
Speaker 1: The thing about Napster was that even though it was so primitive, so many people were using it.

556
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:36,149
Speaker 0: Because there was no fear.

557
00:32:37,112 --> 00:32:37,474
Speaker 1: Well, no.

558
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:38,620
Speaker 1: It's not that there was no fear.

559
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,330
Speaker 1: It's that you could find anything.

560
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:45,130
Speaker 1: Because it was like the library of Alexandria when it comes to music and file sharing.

561
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,590
Speaker 1: Everything you could think of was there somewhere.

562
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,390
Speaker 0: Well, anything you could think of that was modern.

563
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:50,326
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

564
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,698
Speaker 0: You couldn't find old stuff.

565
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:53,710
Speaker 0: You couldn't find a lot of foreign stuff right away.

566
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:59,630
Speaker 1: You couldn't find old and foreign stuff, but anything that was ever really on the radio in America, you could find.

567
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:00,475
Speaker 0: Yeah.

568
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:00,964
Speaker 0: And really...

569
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,637
Speaker 1: Type in Elvis, every Elvis song.

570
00:33:02,698 --> 00:33:04,970
Speaker 1: Type in Rolling Stones, every Rolling Stones song.

571
00:33:05,011 --> 00:33:05,460
Speaker 1: Just ding!

572
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:05,889
Speaker 1: There they are.

573
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,730
Speaker 0: And no one really thought about it, because no one was being sued.

574
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:12,610
Speaker 0: Most people who used it didn't even think about it being illegal.

575
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,410
Speaker 0: Especially since it was from this legit-looking company.

576
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, people just did it.

577
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:18,345
Speaker 1: Everyone was happy.

578
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:19,150
Speaker 1: Everything was awesome.

579
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,230
Speaker 1: At college campuses, it was insane, because everything was so fast.

580
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,200
Speaker 1: You'd be like, "Song!

581
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:23,464
Speaker 1: Song!

582
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:23,707
Speaker 1: Song!

583
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:23,848
Speaker 1: Song!".

584
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:28,170
Speaker 1: And within a minute, everyone on the whole campus could have every single thing everyone else had.

585
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:29,250
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

586
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,892
Speaker 0: Yep.

587
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,410
Speaker 0: And it ushered in a new era.

588
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,550
Speaker 0: My MP3 collection quintupled every day.

589
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,714
Speaker 1: It was the greatest.

590
00:33:36,577 --> 00:33:36,999
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

591
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,470
Speaker 1: But then freshman year of college is, what, 2000?

592
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,605
Speaker 0: Yeah.

593
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:41,932
Speaker 1: 2001-ish.

594
00:33:42,635 --> 00:33:47,410
Speaker 1: They started to block it and filter it, and eventually they killed it off pretty quick.

595
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, then it got sued and it went down.

596
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,608
Speaker 1: Which sucked.

597
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,793
Speaker 0: Of course.

598
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:55,150
Speaker 0: Right about that time, the peer-to-peer revolution happened.

599
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,022
Speaker 0: Because Napster itself wasn't that great.

600
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:58,069
Speaker 0: It was just the first one.

601
00:33:58,491 --> 00:34:04,950
Speaker 1: Well, there was other ones that were about what Napster was about, but none of them had the people to actually be useful.

602
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,050
Speaker 0: Well, because Napster came, it was the first one that took off, and the community was so big that that was it.

603
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,248
Speaker 0: You didn't need to go anywhere else.

604
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:14,270
Speaker 0: Of course, as time went on, other ones appeared.

605
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:19,170
Speaker 0: And once Napster died, once we knew it was dead forever, all the other ones exploded.

606
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,215
Speaker 1: WinMX came out.

607
00:34:21,597 --> 00:34:22,380
Speaker 1: Kazaa.

608
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:24,509
Speaker 1: Nutella finally got some users.

609
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,681
Speaker 1: You know, Limewire, which is I think also Nutella.

610
00:34:28,702 --> 00:34:30,690
Speaker 1: It got crazy go nuts.

611
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,110
Speaker 0: Yep.

612
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:32,228
Speaker 0: Then there was WinMX.

613
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:32,973
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, wait.

614
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:33,679
Speaker 1: Hotline.

615
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,790
Speaker 1: Hotline was classic.

616
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:36,699
Speaker 0: I totally forgot about Hotline, didn't you?

617
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:38,630
Speaker 0: You ran that Hotline server for a while.

618
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:39,408
Speaker 1: I sure did.

619
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,330
Speaker 0: It was really popular.

620
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,449
Speaker 1: We got lots of anime on that Hotline server.

621
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:48,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, we basically, Scott set up a Hotline server at RIT, and we got fansubs and shared them.

622
00:34:48,572 --> 00:34:51,949
Speaker 1: Hotline was actually this really old thing.

623
00:34:52,710 --> 00:35:09,570
Speaker 1: You would run a Hotline server, and people with Hotline clients could visit it, and Hotline servers had files that were shared and rules about sharing the files, and you could upload things to a Hotline server, and you could have a message of the day, and you could chat on the Hotline servers.

624
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:15,490
Speaker 1: They had all kinds of... It was just a server you could connect to with the Hotline client and do all sorts of things on.

625
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:22,170
Speaker 1: And mostly, people would go around looking for Hotline servers and download files from them and upload files to them.

626
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,630
Speaker 0: Yep, it was real slick, it was real fun, and it slowly got shot down over time.

627
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,619
Speaker 1: I don't know if it got shut down.

628
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,750
Speaker 1: I think something weird happened to the company.

629
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:30,190
Speaker 0: Not shut down, shot down.

630
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,201
Speaker 1: Oh, it got something weird happened to the company.

631
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:33,530
Speaker 1: It was a very strange situation.

632
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,770
Speaker 0: Yep, and then it stopped being updated, and then there were holes in it, and then other better things appeared.

633
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:43,170
Speaker 1: You know, we could probably use the Hotline model combined with the BitTorrent model in some fashion.

634
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:44,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, the main problem with Hotline...

635
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,770
Speaker 1: Also with the Waste model, somehow.

636
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:51,050
Speaker 0: Is that all these early peer-to-peers were very open, because no one really worried about lawsuits.

637
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:55,849
Speaker 0: If you were at a Hotline server, it was directly and easily traceable right to you.

638
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,340
Speaker 1: Oh, you'd be able to just visit it.

639
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,190
Speaker 1: You're running a server.

640
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,637
Speaker 0: Yeah.

641
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,843
Speaker 1: It's like, "Hello, come visit my server.

642
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:01,507
Speaker 1: It's got good

643
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:01,890
Speaker 1: stuff.".

644
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,350
Speaker 0: Some people, a lot of them were password protected or secret.

645
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,146
Speaker 0: Like, you had to know, "Oh, connect to this IP address with this

646
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:07,669
Speaker 0: password."

647
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:11,969
Speaker 0: Or, "Go to this website and prove that you're not evil cops, and then we'll let you

648
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:12,110
Speaker 0: in.".

649
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:23,209
Speaker 1: Oh, a lot of people would have things like, "If you want the password to my Hotline, go to this website, click on this thing, and then do this and that, and that way I get, like, five bucks whenever you do that stupid thing with an advertisement, and then you can get into my

650
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:23,530
Speaker 1: Hotline.".

651
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,829
Speaker 0: A lot of people made money that way.

652
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,763
Speaker 1: A lot of people made money that way.

653
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:27,570
Speaker 1: Scarily.

654
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:38,850
Speaker 0: Now, these things were all great, but none of them really... Like, one would come up and it'd be great, and then eventually, either from lawsuits or technologically or just community-wise, it would collapse.

655
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:42,790
Speaker 0: There's really no loyalty in the peer-to-peer world.

656
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,190
Speaker 1: Nope.

657
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:44,897
Speaker 1: People would go wherever the files were.

658
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:55,590
Speaker 1: If anything weird started happening, or if the user experience started to suck, or if there were no new files, or if users started being assholes, people would just leave and go find some other way to get their files.

659
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:04,610
Speaker 1: Whatever way was the easiest way to get files, people would go through any amount of hell to get that way to work, as long as the way itself was easy.

660
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:06,156
Speaker 0: Of course, it's still kind of that way.

661
00:37:06,397 --> 00:37:07,822
Speaker 0: I mean, Supernova went down.

662
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:09,850
Speaker 0: People just jumped to Pirate's Bay and never looked back.

663
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:10,411
Speaker 1: Yep.

664
00:37:10,935 --> 00:37:12,184
Speaker 1: Nobody remembers Supernova now.

665
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:12,910
Speaker 1: It's all Pirate Bay.

666
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:13,531
Speaker 0: Yeah.

667
00:37:13,994 --> 00:37:15,445
Speaker 0: And Pirate Bay can't be taken down.

668
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:16,170
Speaker 0: It's not illegal.

669
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,303
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's Torrent Reactor, and there's Mininova, and there's a whole bunch of sites now.

670
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:21,868
Speaker 1: They took out Supernova.

671
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:22,390
Speaker 1: Ooh, big deal.

672
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:28,670
Speaker 0: Now, anyway, peer-to-peer, because we just talked kind of wildly and openly about the history of it and no particular...

673
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:29,512
Speaker 1: What do you want?

674
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:32,370
Speaker 1: We're just trying to finish off this day so we can do our E3 day tomorrow.

675
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:32,830
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

676
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:33,630
Speaker 1: This day's a throwaway.

677
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:38,370
Speaker 0: We've had so much breaking news for E3 during this podcast.

678
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,451
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter.

679
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:47,330
Speaker 1: Anyone out there who knows is reading all this stuff now, and they're just waiting because tomorrow we'll have insightful commentary as opposed to just information.

680
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:54,450
Speaker 0: All I have to say, and I'm not going to say any specifics, but when I picture Sony now, all I picture is the biggest ha-ha guy in the world.

681
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,749
Speaker 1: The biggest ha-ha guy in the world?

682
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,689
Speaker 0: Because Sony's done.

683
00:37:57,931 --> 00:37:58,508
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

684
00:37:58,852 --> 00:37:59,530
Speaker 0: Sony's done.

685
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:00,528
Speaker 1: All right, anyway.

686
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:13,469
Speaker 0: So, peer-to-peer, all it means is that, in the old days, when we were talking about FTP sites or websites, if you download a file, you connect to a server, and you download the file in one go, and that's it.

687
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,763
Speaker 0: Peer-to-peer, everyone's a server and everyone's a client.

688
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:20,750
Speaker 0: Everyone downloads from everyone.

689
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:26,090
Speaker 0: No one person or client is better or more authoritative than another person or client.

690
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,957
Speaker 0: Now, you might think, "Eh, but how does that work?

691
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,119
Speaker 0: Because it could be insecure and

692
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:31,380
Speaker 0: blah.".

693
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,110
Speaker 0: Well, there's so many people that you can use algorithms to figure out who's good and who's bad.

694
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:50,879
Speaker 0: If you're downloading a file from a bunch of different people and they're all downloading it from you, you can do various MD5-type checksum things, hashes, and see, "Hey, all the data from this guy is no good compared to everyone else's.

695
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:51,960
Speaker 0: I'm just going to block

696
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,120
Speaker 0: him.".

697
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:53,105
Speaker 1: Yep.

698
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:57,779
Speaker 1: They didn't actually add that sort of functionality for a long time.

699
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:02,150
Speaker 1: In the beginning, there were a whole bunch of people, but you had to pick one guy.

700
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,070
Speaker 1: It wasn't until much later where you could download something from multiple people at once.

701
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:14,930
Speaker 1: And now, finally, we have BitTorrent, which is a whole bunch of people have different parts of the same thing, and then they all kind of pass it around until everyone's got the whole thing.

702
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,734
Speaker 0: Even though it's funny how the revolution kind of became full circle in terms of the interface.

703
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:32,210
Speaker 0: I mean, it went from going to sites, clicking on links, getting files, to loading special software, to loading crazier special software that was meta-software for all the other softwares, to going to websites and clicking on links for files.

704
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:32,658
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

705
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:34,730
Speaker 0: Only now, the links are awesome BitTorrent.

706
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,070
Speaker 1: And that actually work every time, mostly.

707
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:40,878
Speaker 0: Now, surprisingly, and I don't want to sound like the old man, "I was better back in the day,".

708
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:46,330
Speaker 0: but there really weren't assholes and griefers in the early days of peer-to-peer.

709
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,670
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't until the Kazaa days that there were assholes and griefers.

710
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:56,302
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, if you searched for an MP3 and it was called "Elvis whatever," you were guaranteed to get Elvis whatever.

711
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,630
Speaker 0: There was no chance of accidentally getting lesbian porn instead.

712
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:05,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, even on the WinMX days, people would, you know, some people would say, "Hey, I don't want to let you upload.

713
00:40:05,926 --> 00:40:07,490
Speaker 1: They'd cancel you unless you traded with

714
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:07,630
Speaker 1: them.".

715
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,317
Speaker 1: But most people, you know, you click on a file, you'd get it.

716
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:17,110
Speaker 1: Most people would keep their program open and online all the time, so you would just keep downloading until you got the whole thing.

717
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:22,910
Speaker 0: But then, assholes appeared, and two, the recording industry decided to start flooding the networks with bad data.

718
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:30,030
Speaker 1: And it seems that they're slowly shutting down all those peer-to-peer networks one at a time, except Bittorrent.

719
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, because Bittorrent really can't be shut down.

720
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,729
Speaker 1: Bittorrent is God.

721
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,550
Speaker 0: I mean, very briefly, we can explain how Bittorrent works.

722
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,312
Speaker 1: I already did.

723
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:41,082
Speaker 1: One guy sets up a tracker.

724
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:42,688
Speaker 1: I don't even think you need the trackers anymore.

725
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:43,230
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

726
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:46,005
Speaker 0: There are ways to do trackerless torrents.

727
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:51,219
Speaker 1: And you get these torrent files, and you download the torrent file.

728
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:56,289
Speaker 1: The torrent file is just a description of where the real file's at and how to get it.

729
00:40:56,932 --> 00:41:00,610
Speaker 1: So you just download this little torrent file, and you run it with Bittorrent client.

730
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,548
Speaker 1: The Bittorrent client looks at the torrent file, and it says, "Okay, that's how I'm going to get this

731
00:41:04,568 --> 00:41:04,849
Speaker 1: file.".

732
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:12,869
Speaker 1: It goes around to the tracker, and the tracker says, "Okay, these are the people who have that file and are torrenting it right

733
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:13,090
Speaker 1: now.".

734
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:20,910
Speaker 1: And then you hook up with all the other people who are torrenting the file that you want, and it starts getting pieces from all those different people at once.

735
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:30,270
Speaker 1: And as you collect pieces, if new people come around who don't have the pieces that you got, you give them the pieces that you got, and other people give you the pieces you don't got.

736
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:38,510
Speaker 1: And if there's a whole lot of people doing the same file at once, you can get the whole file pretty quickly, because there's just so many people giving you pieces.

737
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,659
Speaker 1: But if there aren't so many people, then it takes a long time.

738
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:47,070
Speaker 1: If there's just one guy and you, you just directly download it from him really slowly.

739
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,170
Speaker 0: Now think about the huge advantage of this for, say, someone like us, where we host files.

740
00:41:52,610 --> 00:42:00,310
Speaker 0: Say we wanted to make a compilation of the first five months of Geek Nights in one torrent, or one file, or one set of files.

741
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:07,410
Speaker 0: If we just had it to download, every person who downloaded it would kill our server with a giant bandwidth bill, and we'd be fucked.

742
00:42:08,551 --> 00:42:12,470
Speaker 0: If we had a torrent, if one person downloads it, it's the same as if we had a normal file.

743
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,350
Speaker 0: But if two people download it, ooh, we start saving bandwidth.

744
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:23,290
Speaker 0: And if a thousand people download it, not only does it save us a ton of bandwidth, but it's actually faster for everyone else to get the file than if we were just hosting it correctly.

745
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,357
Speaker 1: As long as everyone downloads it at the same time.

746
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:29,270
Speaker 1: If one guy downloads it today and another guy downloads it tomorrow, it doesn't make a difference.

747
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:45,530
Speaker 1: Unless the first guy, because what you can do with BitTorrent is after you finish downloading something, you keep the window open and you don't close BitTorrent, and then you'll keep giving pieces to other people who don't have pieces, but of course you already have every piece of the file so you don't need to get anymore.

748
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,990
Speaker 1: You just keep giving and giving and giving to people who don't have it.

749
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,890
Speaker 0: But it's a very good poor man's way of doing load balancing.

750
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,920
Speaker 0: Say you've got a big file you want to share with people.

751
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:56,410
Speaker 0: In the old days, you just had to buy a big pipe and big servers.

752
00:42:57,071 --> 00:43:05,650
Speaker 0: Now, say you have three servers, or three places you can seed, you have those three places seed, and then the torrent file will start getting stuff from all three of those.

753
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,773
Speaker 0: Thus balancing the load.

754
00:43:08,134 --> 00:43:13,930
Speaker 0: And then if you get crazy popular suddenly, you get a swarm, and then you're okay because now the swarm takes care of itself.

755
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:26,154
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're using BitTorrent as not like a shady one-man file sharing, but as a big corporation trying to distribute files easily, BitTorrent can work really well.

756
00:43:26,214 --> 00:43:32,827
Speaker 1: if you just set up like ten or twenty computers to all seed the torrents all the time.

757
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:34,570
Speaker 1: Freakin' that's great.

758
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a really, really good way to balance load.

759
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,924
Speaker 1: Especially if you put them in ten different places around the net.

760
00:43:40,964 --> 00:43:41,990
Speaker 1: Hey, we should start a company.

761
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:48,290
Speaker 1: We'll just buy ten really big servers around the net, and we'll torrent your files from all these ten places at once.

762
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,720
Speaker 0: You know, I was about to say the same thing.

763
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,010
Speaker 0: That's a really good idea.

764
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,354
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's like ten places around the country.

765
00:43:53,394 --> 00:44:02,070
Speaker 1: Give us a file, we'll torrent it on all the machines at once, and then whenever anyone tries to get your torrent, it's guaranteed to be fast and wicked.

766
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:08,170
Speaker 0: Plus, I see in the future, as torrent becomes more and more ubiquitous, because it has already stood up to the test of time.

767
00:44:08,673 --> 00:44:08,907
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

768
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:17,790
Speaker 0: Things that are in some ways slightly better or slightly different have come up, and then immediately collapsed and disappeared because BitTorrent is just so... it's like MP3.

769
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,926
Speaker 1: Well, most of the things that have come up to be like BitTorrent are... because BitTorrent was open source.

770
00:44:22,946 --> 00:44:24,230
Speaker 1: I think it is open source still.

771
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:37,330
Speaker 1: And people seem to take the BitTorrent client and the BitTorrent server also, and they sort of remix it, or add a feature, or add a DRM, or change the way it looks, or something evil like that.

772
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,100
Speaker 1: And they'll try to sell it, or they'll try to say, "You have to use our thing.

773
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,882
Speaker 1: You can't actually...".

774
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:44,689
Speaker 1: you know, when it's really just BitTorrent with their name on it.

775
00:44:45,191 --> 00:44:46,535
Speaker 1: And all kinds of weird stuff.

776
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:48,881
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

777
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:51,930
Speaker 1: Nothing else has really done the same thing BitTorrent has done.

778
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, or people have tried to do things better, but they didn't work as well.

779
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:56,253
Speaker 1: Mmm.

780
00:44:57,091 --> 00:45:01,530
Speaker 0: I mean, the model of BitTorrent on a high level of how it works is pretty much rock solid.

781
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:09,650
Speaker 0: They could probably do things on the low level to make it optimized better, but in terms of the concept, I think it's dead on, and I don't see anything usurping it anytime soon.

782
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:10,972
Speaker 1: Nah, I don't think so either.

783
00:45:10,992 --> 00:45:14,058
Speaker 1: I mean, it's pretty much here to stay.

784
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:20,650
Speaker 1: The music people and the movie people don't seem to be going after it, because the guy who runs it made that agreement with them.

785
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:26,650
Speaker 1: They're gonna go out to the torrent sites, but I don't think Pirate Bay's gonna give up, which means they're pretty much screwed.

786
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:29,763
Speaker 0: What Pirate Bay is doing is perfectly legal in their country.

787
00:45:29,843 --> 00:45:31,390
Speaker 0: They cannot go after Pirate's Bay.

788
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:38,229
Speaker 1: The only way you can go after the BitTorrent people is if the ISPs continue to screw up BitTorrent.

789
00:45:38,891 --> 00:45:41,517
Speaker 1: Our ISP is relatively nice when it comes to BitTorrent.

790
00:45:41,537 --> 00:45:47,730
Speaker 1: They only do one little thing that's not so annoying to kind of hinder you from being a seed tracker guy.

791
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:54,149
Speaker 0: Plus, even then, BitTorrent, it's very easy if you're a client to route around whatever they do to you.

792
00:45:55,330 --> 00:46:03,590
Speaker 0: Because, especially, I mean, BitTorrent uses different ports and there are different ways to set it up, but for people who don't know anything about networking, I do recommend Azureus as a BitTorrent client.

793
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,090
Speaker 1: Ah, I just use the regular old BitTorrent client.

794
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:10,910
Speaker 0: Well, the one difference is that Azureus, you can set one incoming port and tunnel it through your router.

795
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,829
Speaker 1: You can do that with BitTorrent normal also.

796
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, you said you couldn't before.

797
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can.

798
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:15,889
Speaker 0: Because I asked and you said now.

799
00:46:16,354 --> 00:46:17,328
Speaker 1: I said I wouldn't want to.

800
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:17,933
Speaker 0: Eh?

801
00:46:18,953 --> 00:46:21,789
Speaker 0: Why would I want to if I- Anyway, Azureus is really easy to use.

802
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,923
Speaker 1: It's Java, it's big and slow, and it's this giant freaking window full of crap.

803
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:29,470
Speaker 1: The real BitTorrent client's a nice little window, it's happy.

804
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:30,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I- It's simple.

805
00:46:31,151 --> 00:46:38,370
Speaker 0: People out there seem to like Azureus, and I've noticed people I offer BitTorrent to tend to prefer it or don't really like the normal BitTorrent client.

806
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:42,042
Speaker 1: I don't know why, maybe it's because they didn't like the older BitTorrent client.

807
00:46:42,062 --> 00:46:44,050
Speaker 1: They don't realize the new one doesn't suck as much.

808
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:44,724
Speaker 0: That might be.

809
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:56,270
Speaker 1: The other thing is I notice a lot of people who are using the Azureuses and whatnot, they seem to be wanting to cheat the system or have more control over BitTorrent than you're supposed to.

810
00:46:56,330 --> 00:47:00,963
Speaker 1: They'll be like, "Ah, I want to use this so I can not upload as

811
00:47:01,003 --> 00:47:01,224
Speaker 1: much.".

812
00:47:01,304 --> 00:47:02,929
Speaker 1: It's like, "No, you should upload as much as you

813
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:03,129
Speaker 1: can.".

814
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:06,819
Speaker 0: Well, it depends on what kind of connection you're on.

815
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:09,969
Speaker 0: If you're on a symmetrical cable connection where you're-.

816
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:16,270
Speaker 1: Well, the regular BitTorrent client has one slider, and you slide that slider to what your connection is, and that's it.

817
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:22,580
Speaker 1: These other clients, they have things like, "Don't share it all for this file," "Do this for that one,".

818
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:27,490
Speaker 1: and it's all these extra controls that make it more complicated that really don't need to be there.

819
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's nice to have them there.

820
00:47:29,456 --> 00:47:32,930
Speaker 0: People don't seem to use them that often except for a handful of assholes out there.

821
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I know it's the most- I don't know.

822
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:36,862
Speaker 1: I just don't see the point.

823
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:38,547
Speaker 1: It's like, "What are you going to use them,

824
00:47:38,587 --> 00:47:38,788
Speaker 1: never?".

825
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:40,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, you never know.

826
00:47:40,097 --> 00:47:41,470
Speaker 0: It depends on what's your situation.

827
00:47:42,253 --> 00:47:46,650
Speaker 1: What kind of situation could it be where you would need more controls than what the regular BitTorrent client gives you?

828
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:52,521
Speaker 1: If you've got a weird- Name one thing that Azureus has that the regular BitTorrent client doesn't that you need.

829
00:47:53,744 --> 00:47:54,005
Speaker 1: Nothing.

830
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:55,950
Speaker 1: Or MicroTorrent, nothing.

831
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:03,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's not much more we can really say about P2P without going into super technical whatnots.

832
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:07,770
Speaker 1: So, E3 tomorrow, woot!

833
00:48:15,412 --> 00:48:17,560
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

834
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:20,150
