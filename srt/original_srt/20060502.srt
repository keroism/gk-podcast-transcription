1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,113
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, May 2nd, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:14,924
Speaker 0: Tonight, we talk about Carcassonne.

3
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:16,238
Speaker 0: Ohohoho.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,338
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,403
Speaker 0: Like I know.

6
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:29,692
Speaker 0: I say like like and you know a lot But I'm gonna make a conscious effort to not like say like you know.

7
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:31,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see how this goes.

8
00:00:31,737 --> 00:00:33,020
Speaker 0: Like yeah, totally.

9
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:36,520
Speaker 0: I don't think I'm gonna be able to stop saying totally though.

10
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,654
Speaker 0: We're just gonna work on like and you know for now.

11
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:39,560
Speaker 0: Totally comes later.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you know the basic trick to not saying words like like or is to think about what the fuck you're saying.

13
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:53,699
Speaker 1: Either that or to pause on other words in such a way that you aren't using words like like or um.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't like doing that so much either.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,539
Speaker 0: I'd much rather think about what I'm gonna say and then say it with really good words like I'm doing right now.

16
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:06,280
Speaker 0: Even though I used one like in that sentence, but it was an appropriate like and not a delaying like.

17
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:13,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if you saying the words really good words as opposed to proper or good diction was very good.

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,509
Speaker 0: Shut up you.

19
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:14,671
Speaker 0: Yeah.

20
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:22,820
Speaker 1: I'm so used to doing this sort of thing in front of people that I'm really used to not saying the word like because it got beaten out of me a long time ago.

21
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,729
Speaker 0: I don't know when I started saying the word like.

22
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:29,390
Speaker 0: I used to not say like and then I listen to myself record and I go wow I'm saying like.

23
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:31,840
Speaker 1: You say you know more than you say like.

24
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:33,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I think that's.

25
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:41,974
Speaker 0: I only seem to say that when I'm trying to explain something to someone and I want to make sure that they understand everything I say.

26
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:42,416
Speaker 0: so I'm like.

27
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:42,658
Speaker 0: you know.

28
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:43,923
Speaker 0: You know.

29
00:01:43,943 --> 00:01:49,239
Speaker 0: It's like Confirm that you have taken in the information which I have conveyed upon you.

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,769
Speaker 1: Humans don't need to act as much as you want us to.

31
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,020
Speaker 1: You'll say you know like every single sentence.

32
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,747
Speaker 0: What can I say?

33
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:55,478
Speaker 0: I'm TCP/IP.

34
00:01:58,627 --> 00:01:59,439
Speaker 0: I should be UDP.

35
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,201
Speaker 0: Yes, you should be.

36
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,246
Speaker 0: I'm gonna downgrade some.

37
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:05,549
Speaker 1: Of course often you are UDP because you'll go you know you know you know and then you'll just keep talking.

38
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,625
Speaker 1: You don't wait for the X. You don't need the X.

39
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:15,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even then it's UDP with some sort of you know backup acknowledgments in the software that just don't care.

40
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,067
Speaker 1: A lot of times you're straight up UDP.

41
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:21,300
Speaker 0: I gotta go to pure UDP where I just dump packets on you, and I don't care.

42
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:22,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, you do that often.

43
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:26,840
Speaker 1: How many times am I like sitting here doing post-production with my headphones on and my back to you?

44
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:31,140
Speaker 1: And then I take the headphones off and you're in the middle of a sentence, and you've been talking to me for a while.

45
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,722
Speaker 0: That's fine.

46
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:37,580
Speaker 0: Who knows though during that talking which you didn't hear I might have been using the words like and you know.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,442
Speaker 1: You probably were.

48
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,972
Speaker 0: Probably, but not for long.

49
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:43,060
Speaker 0: I will stop saying them as much.

50
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,540
Speaker 1: So anyway, we've got some news bits even though today wasn't the best news day.

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,313
Speaker 1: You might be able to tell that we were kind of digging.

52
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:49,979
Speaker 0: Yeah.

53
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,284
Speaker 0: Digging on dig totally.

54
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:53,788
Speaker 0: I said totally.

55
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,151
Speaker 1: Good game.

56
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:57,597
Speaker 0: There is absolutely no news today.

57
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:58,720
Speaker 0: It was so lame.

58
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,625
Speaker 0: Nothing exciting happened.

59
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:04,080
Speaker 0: I mean there was a lot of so lame that people are still talking about the Wii.

60
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,203
Speaker 0: That's how lame the news is.

61
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:09,520
Speaker 1: There was a lot of speculation for E3, but that's all speculation and E3 is real soon.

62
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,148
Speaker 1: There's no reason to talk about it yet.

63
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:13,180
Speaker 0: That's the problem with E3 is they're like okay.

64
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,340
Speaker 0: We're gonna collect all the giant video game news and plop it into one event every year.

65
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:23,175
Speaker 0: So before this event happens there isn't any video game news.

66
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,700
Speaker 0: what so ever.

67
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:33,820
Speaker 0: Everyone is holding on to it and all they're doing is giving you a preview of the news that you might see next week or a week after or whatever.

68
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:34,724
Speaker 1: Weeeee!

69
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,186
Speaker 0: I mean what if you watch the?

70
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:41,620
Speaker 0: you know the CBS or ABC evening news on your television if you watch television?

71
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,280
Speaker 0: And they didn't give you the news about what happened today.

72
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:44,904
Speaker 0: They're like.

73
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,079
Speaker 0: these are the things that might happen tomorrow.

74
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,657
Speaker 0: The war in Iraq might end.

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,678
Speaker 0: You know someone might get impeached.

76
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,067
Speaker 0: There might be a murder.

77
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,294
Speaker 0: There might be a fire.

78
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:54,320
Speaker 0: There might be a car crash.

79
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:59,159
Speaker 1: And Airbus A320 might disappear off the coast of...

80
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:00,098
Speaker 0: But that did happen.

81
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:00,671
Speaker 0: Yeah it did.

82
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:02,880
Speaker 0: But seriously.

83
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:04,959
Speaker 1: So what news did you dig up?

84
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:07,679
Speaker 0: So do you remember the... I said so.

85
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,220
Speaker 0: Do you remember the DARPA Grand Challenge?

86
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:12,380
Speaker 1: I do indeed, but our listeners might not.

87
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:14,894
Speaker 1: We have some listeners who are really into robotics.

88
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,000
Speaker 1: I'm sure they know all about it.

89
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,360
Speaker 0: Right?

90
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,762
Speaker 0: so the DARPA Grand Challenge?

91
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:28,080
Speaker 0: basically DARPA put up a challenge saying if you can get a vehicle without any person in the vehicle or any person controlling the vehicle.

92
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,951
Speaker 0: So the vehicle is autonomous to drive across this stretch of desert all on its own.

93
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:38,420
Speaker 0: you win a prize and a bunch of people entered and no one did it.

94
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,839
Speaker 0: Everyone failed miserably.

95
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,260
Speaker 1: Which was kind of expected.

96
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,960
Speaker 1: It's not the easiest task.

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,683
Speaker 0: No it's not.

98
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:45,880
Speaker 0: So they tried again and they succeeded.

99
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,000
Speaker 0: The Volkswagen Touareg was the most successful.

100
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,400
Speaker 0: It made it all the way across this desert and whatever.

101
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,320
Speaker 0: Now they're saying all right you guys like going across the desert, huh?

102
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,400
Speaker 0: We're going across the city bitches.

103
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,240
Speaker 0: That's right.

104
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,660
Speaker 0: So soon people are going to be making autonomous vehicles that can navigate an urban environment with traffic and the whole stick.

105
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:12,880
Speaker 1: I would just make one that killed everyone in my path thus making an easy exit.

106
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,779
Speaker 0: That's what I didn't understand.

107
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,540
Speaker 0: Why did they use a Volkswagen Touareg?

108
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,903
Speaker 0: I would have used like a tank.

109
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:21,492
Speaker 0: or you know, I said, you know, I know I know a tank.

110
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,025
Speaker 0: What's better than a tank?

111
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:31,059
Speaker 1: a hovercraft tanks need a lot of fuel.

112
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:33,276
Speaker 0: They're also not that fast.

113
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:36,046
Speaker 0: You're right though.

114
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:37,736
Speaker 1: modern battle tanks can go 60 70 miles an hour.

115
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,875
Speaker 0: If not more dude, I'd get one of those six-wheeled ATV things that would make it maybe.

116
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:45,636
Speaker 1: so you got.

117
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:47,060
Speaker 1: you need a human to drive that.

118
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,580
Speaker 0: No, you can get that to be autonomous.

119
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:50,815
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's see you do it.

120
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:52,339
Speaker 0: All right.

121
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:53,326
Speaker 1: All right, you're on.

122
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:55,120
Speaker 1: I'll bet you a million dollars.

123
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:58,440
Speaker 1: You never make a six-wheeled ATV autonomous in the rest of your life.

124
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:00,560
Speaker 0: Well, they got that Mars Rover thing.

125
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:04,879
Speaker 0: I said you give me some money and I could do it.

126
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:06,818
Speaker 1: No, no, you didn't say you needed money.

127
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:10,900
Speaker 0: If you enter the DARPA Grand Challenge, they have like these tests, right?

128
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,180
Speaker 0: And they're like there are two different ways to actually get money from them to enter the challenge if you can't afford to do it yourself.

129
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:25,840
Speaker 0: Like if you're a college and you like show them you have the muster they give you a pot like a hundred thousand dollars to enter to use to do your stuff.

130
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:31,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have this feeling that if we had ever gotten that much money to make a robot, we would have spent it on various things.

131
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:41,760
Speaker 1: And then on the day of the competition, we would have brought in a small remote controlled car that would have made it about five feet at the make it at the hobby house with the last five bucks.

132
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,359
Speaker 0: You know, our little remote control car might actually make it.

133
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,580
Speaker 0: The problem is, is there's a like a time limit and a distance.

134
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:52,339
Speaker 0: And so the and you know, it has to be autonomous.

135
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:55,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can make an autonomous one, but that's the hard part.

136
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,620
Speaker 1: It's not hard to make a vehicle that will travel that far.

137
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,200
Speaker 1: It's hard to make a vehicle that can travel that far without intelligence.

138
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:03,520
Speaker 0: We just hide the remote control.

139
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,898
Speaker 1: So they don't know or get a really, really small dude.

140
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:10,677
Speaker 0: Ooh, clown car.

141
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:12,618
Speaker 0: It's a good one.

142
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,180
Speaker 0: All right, so, yeah, there's going to be an urban DARPA challenge.

143
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:24,339
Speaker 0: And my prediction is that in the first go, most of all the cars are going to mess up.

144
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:34,620
Speaker 1: And in the second go, which they'll no doubt have, I'm really curious how they're going to be on the whole traffic situation or people in the city because urban environments are highly variable.

145
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,159
Speaker 1: And you have to worry about hurting people.

146
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:38,901
Speaker 0: I don't know.

147
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:43,228
Speaker 0: That's the one question I have is are they going to have a simulated city or are they going to use a real city?

148
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:50,080
Speaker 1: or maybe they'll use a real city, but cordon off some streets and have people and vehicles who are paid and trained to be in the area?

149
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,582
Speaker 1: I don't know.

150
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,020
Speaker 0: I don't want to live in that city on that day.

151
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:53,800
Speaker 0: Big traffic.

152
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll have to watch and find out.

153
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:56,679
Speaker 0: We sure will.

154
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,999
Speaker 1: Maybe some of those people in our forums will know more about it.

155
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,440
Speaker 0: Yep, I'm sure it'll be quite awesome, especially since this will advance Xdriver technology.

156
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:08,700
Speaker 1: That show was so stupid.

157
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,078
Speaker 0: It was pretty stupid, but...

158
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:19,679
Speaker 1: All right, so there's been a lot of talk for a while now about all the record labels being pissed off at Apple for the fact that all the songs on iTunes cost 99 cents.

159
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:29,520
Speaker 1: And they've been saying off over and over again, if you don't let us have variable pricing, we're going to leave and then iTunes will fail and Apple will fall apart and everything will be over.

160
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,720
Speaker 1: And Apple was mostly ignoring them, but there was a lot of buzz that what if the record labels pull out?

161
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:47,360
Speaker 1: And today or yesterday, it was decided a hundred percent, all the record labels signed on with iTunes yet again, and they accepted and kept the 99 cents per song price.

162
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:51,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is, 99 cents is still too much.

163
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd pay 99 cents for a movie.

164
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:05,080
Speaker 0: If they brought down to, say, a dollar an album, oh, $2.50 an album, I'd be all right if it was something I couldn't get elsewhere.

165
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,060
Speaker 1: You know, the way most music goes these days, a dollar an album is the same as a dollar a song, because you only wanted one song anyway.

166
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:19,519
Speaker 0: It's true, but often what I found is like back in the day, when I would buy albums because there really wasn't MP3s yet.

167
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have about four CDs I purchased in my life.

168
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,320
Speaker 0: It's like, think about this, you buy, you go to the store and you buy Queens and Night at the Opera because you want to listen to Bohemian Rhapsody, right?

169
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,379
Speaker 0: But that's not the best song on there.

170
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,460
Speaker 0: There's like five or six other awesome songs on there.

171
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, because Queen was the exception, they had talent.

172
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:41,260
Speaker 0: Well, no, because if you don't have talent, you're not going to have the one good song.

173
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:43,860
Speaker 1: I submit to you all the one-hit wonders.

174
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,179
Speaker 0: The one-hit wonders?

175
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,480
Speaker 1: Remember Fastball?

176
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:47,144
Speaker 0: No.

177
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,118
Speaker 1: They got popular right about when MP3s were getting popular.

178
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,460
Speaker 0: See, because the thing is, other stupid people like one-hit wonders.

179
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,300
Speaker 0: The one-hits where the band doesn't actually have talent, I don't like those songs.

180
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,439
Speaker 0: I've never liked any of them.

181
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,940
Speaker 1: To me, their song, I don't even remember what it was called, but it was good, like I really liked the song, and I thought, ooh, they're a good band.

182
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:08,399
Speaker 1: That's a really cool song, I wonder what else they can do.

183
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:10,379
Speaker 1: And everything else they did was crap.

184
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,620
Speaker 0: See, for me, it's the songs that aren't hits, but they're really good, that are on those albums.

185
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,039
Speaker 0: Those are the songs I like the most.

186
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,079
Speaker 0: You know, the song that gets onto the single isn't always the best one.

187
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:24,020
Speaker 0: At least, from my perspective.

188
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:27,480
Speaker 0: Most of my favorite songs are ones that were not hits.

189
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,200
Speaker 1: I'm talking about music in general.

190
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, in general!

191
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,700
Speaker 1: No, in general, most albums have one good song, if that.

192
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:37,700
Speaker 1: Or at least one song that's popular that they use to trick people into buying the rest of the album.

193
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,920
Speaker 0: To stupid people with bad taste in music, the music that I like, they're often multiple good songs per album.

194
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,038
Speaker 1: Ah, the music snob.

195
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,240
Speaker 0: I'm not a music snob, I like a shit ton of music.

196
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but all the music you don't like, only stupid people like.

197
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:52,814
Speaker 0: Yeah.

198
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,060
Speaker 0: Anything that I don't like, only stupid people like.

199
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,359
Speaker 0: That's the law of the universe.

200
00:10:58,121 --> 00:11:07,080
Speaker 1: But anyway, this iTunes news just shows that despite all of their bluffing and posturing, the labels really realize that they need Apple and iTunes, or they're done.

201
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:08,700
Speaker 1: They can't ignore the internet.

202
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:11,915
Speaker 1: And they kept saying, "Oh, we'll just drop off of iTunes,".

203
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:12,799
Speaker 1: but none of them did.

204
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,300
Speaker 0: Gadget podcast I was listening to today pointed out something really interesting that I hadn't thought of before.

205
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:29,640
Speaker 0: Is that they were talking about how the electronics companies and all the gadget makers really don't care about DRM or anything.

206
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,680
Speaker 0: They want that stuff to go away, they don't like broadcast flags and shit.

207
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,779
Speaker 1: Well yeah, 'cause it makes them have to do more stuff that they don't need to do.

208
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,979
Speaker 0: It basically just fucks them.

209
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:38,861
Speaker 0: And how?

210
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:51,840
Speaker 0: the government is making laws to favor this one industry of content creators and owners, and hurt this other industry of, you know, technology creators and owners.

211
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:59,260
Speaker 0: But the thing is, the technology industry is a hajillion times bigger than the entertainment industry.

212
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,180
Speaker 1: So why don't they just hire more lobbyists than the former industry and make it go away?

213
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,840
Speaker 0: Because they're not good at hiring lobbyists because they're not used to doing that.

214
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,240
Speaker 0: The content industry's been at it since the last century.

215
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:14,480
Speaker 0: You know, it's like they don't have that skill.

216
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:21,540
Speaker 0: You know, I might be a level 20th wizard, but you say, "Oh, you're so powerful and bigger than that 10th level fighter.

217
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,058
Speaker 0: Why don't you go beat up that other

218
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:23,199
Speaker 0: guy?".

219
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,920
Speaker 0: Well, 'cause I'm a wizard, I can't beat up anyone.

220
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what it is.

221
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,440
Speaker 1: Well, unless you start at a distance.

222
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,319
Speaker 1: I mean, if you're far enough apart, there's no way the fighter could even reach you.

223
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,460
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, but you're telling me to beat him up specifically with hitting.

224
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:35,956
Speaker 0: It's not the perfect analogy, all right?

225
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:36,280
Speaker 0: Leave me alone.

226
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,320
Speaker 1: It's a bad analogy.

227
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:37,753
Speaker 0: Shut up.

228
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,673
Speaker 1: Lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt.

229
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:40,400
Speaker 1: It's the end of the fighter.

230
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:43,480
Speaker 0: They could lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt.

231
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,100
Speaker 0: And that's why Apple, the technology company, was able to muscle over all those stupid content companies.

232
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though, gladly, Apple didn't really have to say much.

233
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,378
Speaker 1: They just said, basically, "Fuck

234
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:53,539
Speaker 1: you.".

235
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:55,557
Speaker 1: And the label said, "God damn

236
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:55,658
Speaker 1: it.".

237
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, thanks.

238
00:12:57,081 --> 00:13:01,340
Speaker 0: I mean, they're really, the content companies are really good at muscling over the government, you see.

239
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,440
Speaker 0: But they can't muscle over other companies.

240
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:06,154
Speaker 0: So if they try to deal with Apple, Apple's like,

241
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:06,899
Speaker 0: "Yeah?".

242
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:07,756
Speaker 0: And they moon 'em.

243
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,259
Speaker 0: Their big-ass butts.

244
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:12,200
Speaker 1: That another analogy?

245
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:12,739
Speaker 0: No.

246
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:15,219
Speaker 0: Apple literally moons them.

247
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,280
Speaker 0: This dude and his two friends had a intro to 3D animation class.

248
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,120
Speaker 0: Now, they've never animated anything in 3D before, and, you know, they didn't have so many mad skills or anything.

249
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:38,680
Speaker 0: So they made this video for their project.

250
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,840
Speaker 0: Of course, they procrastinated to the last minute, so the physics are kind of bleh.

251
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:44,125
Speaker 1: Actually, it's funny.

252
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:50,338
Speaker 1: When Scott showed it to me, the first thing I said was, "Wow, gravity just is wrong in this

253
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:50,660
Speaker 1: video.".

254
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,973
Speaker 1: When Scott said, "They already said their physics are bad.

255
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:53,275
Speaker 1: Let 'em

256
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:53,556
Speaker 1: go.".

257
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is an intro to 3D animation.

258
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,180
Speaker 0: This is the kids' first time ever making a 3D animation.

259
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, so cut 'em slack on the barrels falling really weirdly.

260
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:04,199
Speaker 0: Yeah.

261
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,660
Speaker 0: But, do give them mad props for their creativity.

262
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,320
Speaker 0: What they've done is create a 3D Rube Goldberg machine.

263
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,320
Speaker 0: So they didn't actually make the Rube Goldberg machine, they made it theoretical.

264
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,000
Speaker 0: Rube Goldberg machine.

265
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,240
Speaker 0: But it has a Nintendo theme.

266
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:22,759
Speaker 1: A quite good one.

267
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, the duck hunt is definitely the best part.

268
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:34,100
Speaker 0: It's so creative, the way they had it set up, and then it... It's like, things have a Nintendo theme on them, but nothing happens, you know, things happen physically.

269
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:35,179
Speaker 0: You'll get it when you watch it.

270
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, even the Tetris one works.

271
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:37,991
Speaker 0: Yep.

272
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,420
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

273
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:41,199
Speaker 1: It's cool.

274
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:46,340
Speaker 0: If you are a fan of things Nintendo, you will be humored by this video.

275
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,580
Speaker 0: I have a better thing of the day for tomorrow, though, so... Just, uh, sit tight.

276
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,659
Speaker 1: Well, since we try to generally theme the things of the day somewhat to the topic at hand, and today is gaming day...

277
00:14:59,004 --> 00:14:59,176
Speaker 0: Yep.

278
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,680
Speaker 1: Mine is completely unrelated.

279
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,599
Speaker 1: No, no, because Best Buy sells games.

280
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,420
Speaker 0: Ooh, it's a Best Buy-related thing of the day.

281
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think...

282
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:13,160
Speaker 0: You know, $500 power cables and shit.

283
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,479
Speaker 1: Nah, nothing like that.

284
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,660
Speaker 1: Though I think everyone out there knows my feelings toward Best Buy.

285
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:20,420
Speaker 1: I generally loathe the company and everything about it.

286
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, you give them money occasionally.

287
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they still have decent products at a low price.

288
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,200
Speaker 0: And there really isn't anywhere else to go besides Circuit City, which isn't any better or worse.

289
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm a big fan of people who freak squares, and I'm a big fan of flash mobs.

290
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, freakin' some squares, alright.

291
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:42,380
Speaker 1: So, Improv Anywhere, Improv Everywhere, they're this group, and I've seen stuff they've done before.

292
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,940
Speaker 1: They've done some really cool flash mob type things, and they did one recently that I thought was, uh, hilarious.

293
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,720
Speaker 1: They got a whole bunch of people, told them to wear khakis, blue polo shirts, belts, and black shoes.

294
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,520
Speaker 1: Basically the Best Buy guy employee, uh, uniform.

295
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:00,659
Speaker 0: Without the yellow tag.

296
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, without the yellow tag and without the Best Buy guy attitude.

297
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:04,769
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

298
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:12,080
Speaker 1: They then, one by one, over the course of several, at least an hour or so, all infiltrated the same Best Buy.

299
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:12,513
Speaker 1: Yeah.

300
00:16:13,526 --> 00:16:14,640
Speaker 1: And just kind of milled around.

301
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

302
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:18,319
Speaker 0: How many people were like, "Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me"?

303
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:23,140
Speaker 1: Oh, you have to read the site, 'cause I really- How do they keep from all laughing hysterically at each other?

304
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:24,479
Speaker 1: These people are good at what they do.

305
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:37,740
Speaker 1: Now, I could go on for a whole episode about the hijinks that ensued, but I would like to say that the manager of the Best Buy probably overreacted in the most amazing- She called 911.

306
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,520
Speaker 1: She called 911.

307
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,600
Speaker 1: The police came.

308
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:49,959
Speaker 1: The police were actually really kind of abusive and threatening, but luckily these flash mob people really knew what they were doing and basically pulled the whole, "I know my rights, you can't do crap to me.

309
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:52,900
Speaker 1: It's not trespassing unless you ask me to leave.

310
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,671
Speaker 1: Are you asking me to

311
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:53,955
Speaker 1: leave?".

312
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,538
Speaker 1: And the cops were like, "Rumble, grumble, grumble, rabble,

313
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:56,840
Speaker 1: rabble.".

314
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:58,500
Speaker 1: And he said, "Are you asking me to leave?

315
00:16:58,701 --> 00:16:58,884
Speaker 1: I'll

316
00:16:58,924 --> 00:16:59,208
Speaker 1: leave.".

317
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:05,280
Speaker 0: We should do an episode about how to deal with the cops.

318
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,279
Speaker 1: I was about to say.

319
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,780
Speaker 0: 'Cause people don't know their rights when it comes to cops, they just bend over backwards.

320
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,436
Speaker 0: "Oh my god, there's a cop, I better do everything he

321
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:11,660
Speaker 0: says.".

322
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,257
Speaker 0: Well, that's not true.

323
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:20,059
Speaker 1: Yep, because I have been approached by police many times in my day for various civil infractions, and I have never once been arrested or even ticketed.

324
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,299
Speaker 0: Here's one easy rule to avoid doing a whole episode right now.

325
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:32,340
Speaker 0: If a cop comes up to you, just question everything he tells you to do, and make sure that, you know, you question everything.

326
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,818
Speaker 0: 'Cause he has to-- he can't lie to you.

327
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:34,636
Speaker 0: By law.

328
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,559
Speaker 1: Well, actually, one step further.

329
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,939
Speaker 1: If you don't want to talk to a police officer, they cannot talk to you if you ask them not to.

330
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:44,559
Speaker 1: Unless they're arresting you or detaining you.

331
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:52,458
Speaker 1: So if a police officer is ever bothering you, and you don't want to be bothered, just ask them straight up, "Are you arresting me or detaining me in any

332
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:52,720
Speaker 1: way?".

333
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:56,620
Speaker 1: If they say yes, you've got a wrongful arrest suit on your hands.

334
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,639
Speaker 0: Unless you did something bad, dumbass.

335
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:11,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not talking-- we're talking about if you're minding your own business, or if you did something that, while technically is illegal, isn't really that bad, like trespassing into an abandoned factory, maybe certain kinds of murder, I don't know.

336
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,959
Speaker 0: Standing in a Best Buy dressed as a Best Buy employee.

337
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, freaking squares.

338
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:20,520
Speaker 0: If the cop says, "No, I'm not arresting you or detaining you," then you just walk away and he can't talk to you anymore.

339
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,837
Speaker 1: Yep, and if he tries to stop you, ask him again, "Are you arresting me or detaining

340
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:23,958
Speaker 1: me?"?

341
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:24,732
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

342
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,599
Speaker 1: That's worked up several times.

343
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,220
Speaker 1: Of course, don't carry crowbars around, even if you are breaking into abandoned factories, because that'll really make him suspicious.

344
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:33,884
Speaker 0: Yeah.

345
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:41,240
Speaker 0: Pretty much almost anything in the world can be considered a burglar's tool, which can almost get probable cause.

346
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:50,659
Speaker 0: So if a cop-- if you're around somewhere and you have like a screwdriver or something, or a flashlight, flashlight is a burglar's tool, so don't let the cop see.

347
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
Speaker 1: All right, one last piece of advice.

348
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,097
Speaker 1: If you happen to be trespassing somewhere and you get caught and you don't want to get caught and go to jail or anything-- Run the fuck away.

349
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,300
Speaker 1: No, don't run from the police unless you're sure you can get away.

350
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,340
Speaker 0: Well, no, run as long-- if they've seen you, then you're pretty much done.

351
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:11,300
Speaker 1: But, you know, if they're real far away-- Well, bear in mind that once you run from the police, they now have probable cause and your ass is done.

352
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:12,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they see you run.

353
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:13,293
Speaker 1: Yeah.

354
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:20,260
Speaker 1: But the common answer, if you're-- This is usually for urban exploration type things, because I really like to do this sort of thing.

355
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,014
Speaker 1: If you're in an abandoned factory and a cop finds you, the answer to any question is, "I heard a scream.

356
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:26,456
Speaker 1: I went to

357
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:27,019
Speaker 1: investigate.".

358
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:27,610
Speaker 0: Ha ha.

359
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:31,820
Speaker 1: But anyway, this Best Buy thing is hilarious.

360
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:34,960
Speaker 1: The management of the store really didn't know what to do.

361
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:42,939
Speaker 1: I think the best part is when, apparently, this sort of thing happens as part of a scam because they have a code thing in place to deal with it.

362
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:43,639
Speaker 1: Really?

363
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:49,044
Speaker 1: The employees were running around and one of them was yelling into their walkie-talkie at one point, "Thomas Crown Affair!

364
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,170
Speaker 1: Thomas Crown Affair!

365
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:51,256
Speaker 1: All employees to the

366
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:51,558
Speaker 1: floor!".

367
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,024
Speaker 0: Eh?

368
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:54,200
Speaker 1: Yeah.

369
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:57,379
Speaker 0: Wasn't that a movie that I didn't see?

370
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,948
Speaker 1: Yes, it was a movie you didn't see.

371
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:01,020
Speaker 1: that is entirely relevant to what happened.

372
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:01,760
Speaker 0: Awesome.

373
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,639
Speaker 1: It's actually-- I'll put it in the queue.

374
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:04,519
Speaker 0: Awesome.

375
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:05,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is hilarious.

376
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:06,320
Speaker 0: Check it out.

377
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,360
Speaker 0: That's the one thing that I don't get.

378
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:15,820
Speaker 0: If you work at a Best Buy and they have all these codes for things and then you know all the codes, it's like, how often does that happen at a Best Buy that they know the code?

379
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:22,740
Speaker 1: Hey, when I did construction way, way back in that K-Mart, I saw some of the sheets they had laying out of all the different codes.

380
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,040
Speaker 1: They have a code for everything.

381
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:33,180
Speaker 1: They have a code for, like, a tornado is coming and what you do, or a kid is missing, or there's someone with a gun in the store, or someone's robbing someone.

382
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:38,520
Speaker 0: We should totally make a website with all the codes and how to set them off in all the different stores.

383
00:20:39,783 --> 00:20:41,960
Speaker 1: All you have to do to set them off is announce them over the PA.

384
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:50,460
Speaker 1: The only reason they have the codes is so that they don't panic anyone who doesn't know what's going on, but yet they can, with very low technology, tell all the employees something.

385
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,065
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

386
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,236
Speaker 1: That's all it is.

387
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:03,680
Speaker 1: So if you know the codes, you can just walk up to one of those phones at, like, a Target or a Walmart, just pick it up and say, "Yeah, we got a code Veronica Blue 6-9er," and hang it up and walk away.

388
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:03,841
Speaker 0: 6-9.

389
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,260
Speaker 1: I actually-- I wasn't actually thinking 6-9 when I said that.

390
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:08,717
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

391
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:10,459
Speaker 1: Giggity.

392
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:12,614
Speaker 1: Tommy boy, was that a 9er?

393
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:13,239
Speaker 1: I heard in there?

394
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,016
Speaker 0: Giggity.

395
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,269
Speaker 0: Okay.

396
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,759
Speaker 1: All right, so today we are going to be talking about a very fun German game called Carcassonne.

397
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:22,582
Speaker 0: What?

398
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:23,369
Speaker 0: Isn't it French?

399
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,599
Speaker 0: At least the name is French.

400
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:25,477
Speaker 0: Carcassonne.

401
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:27,552
Speaker 1: Well, it's a German-style game.

402
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:28,699
Speaker 1: It has a French theme.

403
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:29,400
Speaker 0: Yep.

404
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:37,440
Speaker 1: Now, the game-- I want to preface this right now by saying that Scott and I have various skills in certain things.

405
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,299
Speaker 1: I mean, Scott is pretty much the god of Tetris right now among our group of friends and all that.

406
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:46,059
Speaker 1: Carcassonne, no one can fucking beat me.

407
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:49,290
Speaker 1: I've won, like, the last 15 or 20 times we've played.

408
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,720
Speaker 1: Like, I can't lose no matter what.

409
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,817
Speaker 0: We'll beat you.

410
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,319
Speaker 1: It's gotten to the point where we'll play, and I'll take my turn, I'll say exactly what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.

411
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,180
Speaker 1: Then, on everyone else's turn, I'll tell them exactly what I would do if I was them to win.

412
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:08,894
Speaker 1: And they usually don't listen to me, and they lose, 'cause I'm really not lying.

413
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:10,059
Speaker 1: I tell them exactly what I'd do.

414
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:12,639
Speaker 0: You're cheating.

415
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:19,460
Speaker 1: And we've played so many times, it can't be luck, and once we describe how the game works, we realize that it can't be cheating, because you really can't cheat at this game.

416
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,397
Speaker 0: No, honey, you can't.

417
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,320
Speaker 0: So, the basic idea behind Carcassonne is a tile-laying game.

418
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,720
Speaker 0: On your turn, you'd pick up a tile, and you'd put it somewhere on the board where it fits.

419
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,979
Speaker 0: Now, there is no board, there's just other tiles.

420
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:32,578
Speaker 1: Yep.

421
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:36,880
Speaker 0: So you just kind of attach it to the existing tiles, so that it fits in.

422
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,840
Speaker 1: And by fitting in, they all have little roads and towns and rivers.

423
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,240
Speaker 0: They have roads, grass, castles, occasionally water, but not really.

424
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, and a bunch of other special things that we'll talk about.

425
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,746
Speaker 0: So, you know, you have to put it somewhere where the roads match.

426
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:56,160
Speaker 0: You can't have roads running into grass, or roads running into the side of a castle, or anything like that.

427
00:22:56,421 --> 00:23:03,880
Speaker 1: And then, the only decision you make after putting the tile down is whether or not you want to place one of your little dudes on it, and if so, where on the tile do you want to place them?

428
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,140
Speaker 0: Little dudes, are they technically workers, farmers, peasants?

429
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,120
Speaker 1: BoardGameGeep calls them meeples.

430
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,057
Speaker 0: Meeples?

431
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,217
Speaker 1: I'm not sure why.

432
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,420
Speaker 0: I think that's the generic name for wooden pieces of that shape.

433
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:15,018
Speaker 1: Yeah.

434
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,260
Speaker 0: But that's not their thematic meaning in the theme of Carcassonne.

435
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,080
Speaker 1: I've noticed that we almost never talk about the theme of a game, so it really doesn't matter.

436
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,040
Speaker 1: The theme of the game is you're building little towns in the countryside of France.

437
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:25,626
Speaker 0: Hooray!

438
00:23:26,001 --> 00:23:26,370
Speaker 1: That's it.

439
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,156
Speaker 1: Friends.

440
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,101
Speaker 1: But that's it.

441
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:29,164
Speaker 1: The game is so simple.

442
00:23:29,384 --> 00:23:30,668
Speaker 1: You draw a tile, you look at it.

443
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:35,480
Speaker 1: You show it to everyone around the table, because the rules even say specifically you must show the tile to everyone.

444
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,320
Speaker 0: So that everyone can suggest where to put it.

445
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,460
Speaker 1: Yes, I believe the exact words are so that they can advise.

446
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,669
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

447
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:45,452
Speaker 1: Usually the advice is, "Hey, put it on my

448
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:45,774
Speaker 1: city.".

449
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:46,820
Speaker 1: No, put it on my city!

450
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,745
Speaker 0: Put it somewhere.

451
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,520
Speaker 0: that helps me and screws you over.

452
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,070
Speaker 1: Yeah.

453
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:51,879
Speaker 0: Awesome.

454
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:52,803
Speaker 1: But that's it.

455
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:57,017
Speaker 1: You draw a tile, you place the tile, you put a dude on it or not put a dude on it.

456
00:23:57,398 --> 00:23:57,760
Speaker 1: That's it.

457
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:01,820
Speaker 1: And you go around until all the tiles have been placed, and then you do the final scoring.

458
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,220
Speaker 0: Now the way to score big points is when you put a dude on the board, there are four places you can put him.

459
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,780
Speaker 0: You can put him, well, in the basic game.

460
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,264
Speaker 0: You can put him on a road.

461
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:15,880
Speaker 0: If you put him on a road, you want that road to be really long, because then you get a lot of points.

462
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,502
Speaker 0: Yep.

463
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:22,600
Speaker 1: Basically, you put guys on the board, and with one exception, whenever the thing they're on finishes and scores, you get the dude back.

464
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,939
Speaker 1: Because you have a limited number of dudes.

465
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,376
Speaker 0: So let's say a road is ten tiles long, and I have a guy on that road.

466
00:24:28,537 --> 00:24:29,340
Speaker 0: I get ten points.

467
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,535
Speaker 0: Let's say the road is ten tiles long, and Rim has a guy on the road.

468
00:24:32,575 --> 00:24:33,400
Speaker 0: He gets ten points.

469
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,480
Speaker 0: You can also put guys in castles.

470
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,400
Speaker 0: And the castles, when the castle is sealed up and the castle can't possibly expand anymore, you see how many tiles the castle is.

471
00:24:43,902 --> 00:24:47,700
Speaker 0: So if I make a five tile castle, I would get ten points.

472
00:24:48,202 --> 00:24:50,999
Speaker 0: If there were little shields in the castle, I would get more points than that.

473
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:52,316
Speaker 0: You know, that's how it is.

474
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,580
Speaker 0: Putting guys in the grass is weird.

475
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,140
Speaker 0: Putting guys in the little churches, the cloisters, is also a little weird.

476
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:04,380
Speaker 0: But a cloister can get you anywhere from one to nine points if you put a guy in it.

477
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:12,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically it's just a game of placing your guys in an optimal way so as to get victory points from buildings and roads and such that finish.

478
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:21,800
Speaker 1: And you get some consolation points at the end of the game for things that didn't finish, but you're mostly screwed at that point because you had a guy who was on the board instead of being useful doing nothing.

479
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,271
Speaker 0: You have a limited number of little guys, I think.

480
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:25,276
Speaker 0: Like, nine.

481
00:25:25,497 --> 00:25:26,000
Speaker 0: Not so many.

482
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,507
Speaker 1: Not even.

483
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,059
Speaker 1: Like, seven.

484
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,912
Speaker 0: It's not a lot of guys, especially if you don't have any expansions.

485
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:31,334
Speaker 0: Oi!

486
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:32,840
Speaker 0: You know, you're screwed.

487
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:39,460
Speaker 0: So you have to really, you know, be really discerning about where you put your guys on the board.

488
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:45,600
Speaker 0: If you put them out just on every single tile you put down, you're gonna run out of guys and miss scoring opportunities.

489
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:49,320
Speaker 0: And if you don't put out enough, well you're not gonna score any points.

490
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:53,660
Speaker 0: So you have to really put them in the most optimal places you possibly can.

491
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,140
Speaker 1: Yep.

492
00:25:54,582 --> 00:25:59,760
Speaker 1: And I mean, they're all the places you can put guys that are normal and then whenever whatever it is finishes, you get the points back.

493
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,060
Speaker 1: But then you can put them on the grass, which is a farmer.

494
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:12,040
Speaker 1: And to put it really simply, any cities that are completed at the end of the game are scored based on who has the most farmers touching them.

495
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:15,219
Speaker 1: And you get a bunch of points, I think four for each one.

496
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, so one giant field of grass that all connects and isn't blocked off by roads or castles is a field of grass.

497
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,858
Speaker 0: And you look in that field of grass and you say, "How many completed castles, separate castles, are touching this field of

498
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:30,199
Speaker 0: grass?".

499
00:26:31,002 --> 00:26:33,760
Speaker 0: Let's say there's three completed castles touching the field of grass.

500
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:37,019
Speaker 0: Oh, well I have a farmer in that field of grass.

501
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,100
Speaker 0: So I get four points for three castles, twelve points at the end of the game.

502
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:49,520
Speaker 1: Of course the trade-off is, you put guys in the farm where you now don't get them back and they sit there doing nothing for the entire game until the very very end.

503
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:56,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, putting guys in the farm is kind of troublesome too because other people will throw guys in other farms or the same farm.

504
00:26:56,541 --> 00:27:04,080
Speaker 0: Or they'll sneak other farmers into your farm and beat you out, making your farmer useless, which means now you have guys on the board that aren't doing anything and you can't get them back.

505
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,920
Speaker 1: Now the only other mechanics to the game are that there are cases of ties, and basically if there's a tie, everyone wins.

506
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:17,539
Speaker 1: And the other rule is that you cannot put a guy on a thing that already has a guy in it.

507
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,948
Speaker 1: Now you might wonder, "Alright, then how could I ever tie someone?

508
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:24,519
Speaker 1: If I have a guy on a road, there's no way you could ever put your guy on the

509
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:24,700
Speaker 1: road.".

510
00:27:24,861 --> 00:27:27,500
Speaker 0: Well, I just put my guy on a different road and I connect the two roads.

511
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:36,000
Speaker 1: Yep, so say I got a long road, and then it turns to the right, and then there's a space, and then someone else puts a straight road tile down and puts their guy on it.

512
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,477
Speaker 1: And then the next round he goes, he puts another straight tile to the left of that one, and now the two roads are connected.

513
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:42,380
Speaker 1: Now we're sharing the points.

514
00:27:43,181 --> 00:27:46,080
Speaker 1: If he somehow got two guys on that road, he gets all the points and I get Dick.

515
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,705
Speaker 0: That's how the farmers work also.

516
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:54,883
Speaker 0: You have some grass and some other grass, a guy puts a farmer in the second grass, connects the two grasses to make one grass, and woah!

517
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:56,588
Speaker 0: Castles the same way, too.

518
00:27:56,969 --> 00:28:00,700
Speaker 0: Two castles, a guy in each, castles connect, now it's one castle, the end.

519
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:04,634
Speaker 1: Now, that sounds very simple, and it's true.

520
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:06,220
Speaker 1: The game is incredibly simple.

521
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,700
Speaker 0: I mean, they sell this game in Toys R Us, that's why it's so simple.

522
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,448
Speaker 1: I mean, it's very easy to learn, but don't underestimate this game.

523
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:19,320
Speaker 1: It is not a light or easy game, it is not a limited game, there are many possibilities.

524
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:23,815
Speaker 1: In terms of tactics versus strategy, I'd say it's pretty much 100% tactics.

525
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, you really can't go into the game thinking, "I'm gonna build a big castle," or "I'm gonna try to get a whole bunch of long

526
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:32,140
Speaker 0: roads.".

527
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,842
Speaker 0: That doesn't work.

528
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:35,589
Speaker 0: It's a lot of randomness in what tiles you draw.

529
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:47,396
Speaker 0: You pretty much have to draw tiles, and at the moment you draw the tile, put it in the optimum position to either get the most points for you, or take the most points away from other people.

530
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:54,340
Speaker 0: if you can't get points for you with the tile, and then optimally put your guys out on the tiles you draw to get the most points for you.

531
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:07,138
Speaker 1: Now, you also might think, "Hey, if all you ever get to do is draw a random tile and put it down, you can only put your guys on those random tiles, couldn't you get dicked by the tiles, and wouldn't the tile drawing really affect the

532
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:07,419
Speaker 1: game?".

533
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:08,939
Speaker 0: It kinda does, a little bit.

534
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,328
Speaker 1: The answer is really no, because I always win.

535
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:24,780
Speaker 1: I win every time we play, and I've played a lot of games of this, and the fact that one person can consistently do very well despite the randomness of the tiles means that the tactics mean a lot more than what you draw.

536
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,831
Speaker 0: Yeah, what you draw can mean something.

537
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,620
Speaker 0: if you play in a certain way.

538
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:41,580
Speaker 0: Like, if you play to build a giant castle, then the game might come down to whether you draw a certain tile that can finish the castle or not.

539
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,780
Speaker 0: However, that's only in like a one-game basis.

540
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:57,005
Speaker 0: Overall, from game to game, playing with a better strategy, usually a strategy that doesn't depend on getting specific tiles, will win you the game more often.

541
00:29:57,065 --> 00:30:11,840
Speaker 0: So while someone might play in a certain way and then win or lose based on the draw of the tiles, overall, the way to win the most games over the course of your life is to play better than that and not depend on the tiles you draw.

542
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,980
Speaker 1: Very enlightening, but how come you can never win since you seem to understand that so well?

543
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,460
Speaker 0: Because that's the only part of it I understand, it's not enough.

544
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:24,620
Speaker 1: I mean, the neat thing is that the game's very simple, but there are a lot of things you can do.

545
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,439
Speaker 1: Like, you can't really screw someone other than maybe taking points away from them.

546
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:36,060
Speaker 1: But because the nature of the tiles and the fact that you have to place tiles in a legal manner, you know, roads touch roads, grass touches grass.

547
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:44,680
Speaker 1: If the other person, or say you're playing with a bunch of people and one person is building this massive city and it's huge, it's gonna score them a ton of points and probably win in the game.

548
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:54,060
Speaker 1: You can just put roads and other cities around it in such a way that they'll need a really, really rare or possibly non-existent piece to finish their city.

549
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,999
Speaker 1: Now it's guaranteed the city won't finish, you don't have to worry about it.

550
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:04,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, in the regular old game of Carcassonne with no expansion packs, there are a lot of ways that you can make it so.

551
00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:10,020
Speaker 0: a city can't be finished or a road can't be finished because there is no such piece that fits in that spot.

552
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,361
Speaker 0: So

553
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:23,760
Speaker 1: in normal Carcassonne, unless a bunch of players team up to all of them finish a city together to basically push everyone else out of the game, anyone who tries to build a city that's more than a couple of tiles is gonna get dicked by everyone else just sticking roads in the way.

554
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, a four or five city is like the biggest one you can expect to build by yourself in the long run.

555
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,879
Speaker 0: And even then, you're probably better off building three or fours.

556
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, in original Settlers, or Settlers, god, Carcassonne.

557
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, Carcassonne.

558
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:42,300
Speaker 1: Now, that's it, and I love the game, but we're gonna go over all the expansions because... Well, not all the expansions.

559
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,660
Speaker 1: All the expansions that we have and/or care about.

560
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,880
Speaker 0: Right, now here's the thing, people talk a lot about Carcassonization.

561
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:55,620
Speaker 0: Basically, what they've done, the company that publishes Carcassonne, I don't know who it is, I forget, I think it's Rio Grande, don't quote me on that.

562
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:57,220
Speaker 1: Uh-huh-huh, Incorporated.

563
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:06,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, what they've done is they've taken a whole lot of other German games or European board games and they've put the Carcassonne label on them.

564
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:23,020
Speaker 0: Because Carcassonne was so successful and popular that it sold in Toys R Us even, they figured that they can take other similar tile-laying guy-placing games, slap a Carcassonne label on them, changing the original name of the game, and get a bunch of sales because there's Carcassonne on it.

565
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,011
Speaker 1: And a lot of the games are good, but they're not really what we're talking about.

566
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,240
Speaker 1: These are expansions that basically make it a different game.

567
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:40,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, they also, what they've done is make a bunch of expansion packs, which include tiles and extra wooden pieces that you can add to the game of Carcassonne to put new rules and situations into it.

568
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,300
Speaker 0: And those are the expansion packs we're going to talk about, at least some of the ones we've played.

569
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,540
Speaker 1: Yes, now two of the three are very good and I highly recommend them, but the first one we're going to talk about sucks.

570
00:32:50,201 --> 00:33:00,040
Speaker 1: Now the only other thing I'll say is that when it comes to the expansions, if you buy Carcassonne, I'd highly recommend you play it a whole bunch of times without the expansions before you add them in.

571
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,231
Speaker 0: Yeah, the expansions aren't to make the game playable.

572
00:33:03,271 --> 00:33:05,580
Speaker 0: The game is great and playable all on its own.

573
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:11,660
Speaker 0: The reason to get the expansion is because you've played the original game so much that you need to add some flavor.

574
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,451
Speaker 0: And then when you've played the game out with that expansion, get another expansion, and so on.

575
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:22,480
Speaker 0: Some of the expansions, though, are not so good, I've heard, but I'm only going to talk about the ones I've played.

576
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,348
Speaker 1: Yep, and the ones we've played are all fantastic, except for The River.

577
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:31,180
Speaker 1: Now most Carcassonne boxes now come with The River in the box already.

578
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,008
Speaker 0: Well, The River was the very first expansion, I think, and I think there's a River 2.

579
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:43,120
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if they come with The River 2 now, or, I don't know, but I don't think The River 2 can be that much better than The River 1.

580
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,523
Speaker 1: Yeah, The River's kinda crap.

581
00:33:44,663 --> 00:33:54,460
Speaker 1: All it does is, for the first bit of the game, because normally one tile starts out on the table, and it's always the same tile, and then you take turns drawing and randomly placing.

582
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:01,393
Speaker 1: In The River, before you draw the random tiles, first every round people draw a random tile from the river stack.

583
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,980
Speaker 1: So the game starts with this long river, and then people build off the sides of it.

584
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,900
Speaker 0: Yep, so game usually starts with one tile and now starts with a big long river.

585
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:18,179
Speaker 1: Now, it was cool maybe once or twice, but it really just makes the game more limited and takes away some of the tactical decisions.

586
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:29,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, when the whole board is constructed by people, you know, well, very constructed by people in a mostly random fashion, you really get all sorts of interesting things built.

587
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:35,560
Speaker 0: When you always start the game with The River, every game with The River starts to look just like the last game with The River.

588
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,347
Speaker 1: I mean, the only real use I can see for The River is to break yourselves out of a rut.

589
00:34:39,648 --> 00:34:46,199
Speaker 1: If you've been playing the same game of Carcassonne over and over again because of the way people play, The River will break you up because you can't do what you expect.

590
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,960
Speaker 0: Of course, there are some strategies at The River that make the game really poor.

591
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:56,500
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, like, when I played The River the first time, I just farmed my ass off and won the game by a bajillion.

592
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:58,508
Speaker 0: Yep, 'cause see, what happens with?

593
00:34:58,528 --> 00:35:01,520
Speaker 0: The River is adjacent to the water is a whole bunch of grass.

594
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:14,160
Speaker 0: So you just put farmers in that grass, and now you've got this big U-shaped piece of grass that's gonna have a shit ton of cities adjacent to it when you build the game, and a whole bunch of points.

595
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,480
Speaker 0: So pretty much whoever farms The River the best is probably gonna win.

596
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:20,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I would really not worry about The River.

597
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,563
Speaker 0: Play with The River once or twice.

598
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:35,400
Speaker 0: once you learn how to play Carcassonne, see how it goes, you know, if people are dumb, and they don't realize that you've farmed The River to win, then I guess it can make an interesting game because no one will just win right away with it.

599
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,500
Speaker 1: Well then you'll win right away because you listen to Geek Nights and you know.

600
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:39,760
Speaker 0: Ah, ah, ah.

601
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,306
Speaker 1: Alright, now the first real expansion we bought.

602
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:49,140
Speaker 1: that, in my opinion, makes the game awesome, like it took an awesome game and made it more awesome.

603
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:49,698
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

604
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:51,119
Speaker 1: Inns and cathedrals.

605
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:51,829
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

606
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,380
Speaker 1: Now the one thing it adds, in addition to, it adds some special rules, is it adds an extra player.

607
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,120
Speaker 1: You can now play with one more person.

608
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,440
Speaker 0: Carcassonne I think is only a maximum of six players, two to six?

609
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:03,658
Speaker 1: Uh, it's five players.

610
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,578
Speaker 0: Two to five?

611
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:07,299
Speaker 0: And the inns and cathedrals allows you to play two to six.

612
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:07,769
Speaker 1: Yep.

613
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:10,180
Speaker 1: Now it also adds a big dude.

614
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,579
Speaker 1: So you got all your little dudes, now you have a big dude.

615
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,880
Speaker 1: He counts as two dudes when it comes to breaking ties, but other than that he's just a normal dude.

616
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:22,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, so when you're gonna invade someone else's farm for like a jillion points, throw your big dude down there.

617
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:25,339
Speaker 0: Ho ho, now you're gonna get that farm right out of him.

618
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,980
Speaker 1: Yep, of course, if you put him in a crappy farm, now your big dude's out of the game and you're just kinda dicked.

619
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:30,778
Speaker 0: Yep.

620
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:33,979
Speaker 0: Well, it adds an element of strategy, just like Tikal has the big dude.

621
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,020
Speaker 1: Now it also adds a whole bunch of tiles that are shaped weirdly and weren't in the first Carcassonne.

622
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:46,700
Speaker 1: So now, you won't have those cities that never finish because there's a weird piece that has like two cities and then a road and a plane on them.

623
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:55,560
Speaker 0: But what inevitably happens is those weird tiles come out at the beginning of the game and then you never draw them when you need them to finish the crazy city.

624
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:04,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even so, just having those tiles there makes a lot more things finish and you can't expect to dick someone by sticking a road in their way because they'll find the piece they need.

625
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:23,960
Speaker 0: Well, they're really necessary in a six player game because if you don't have tiles like that, no one's gonna be able to finish anything because you get one sixth of the tiles that are out there to place and it's really not enough to actually score a significant number of points.

626
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:30,140
Speaker 1: Now I note that most of what inns and cathedrals adds to Carcassonne has nothing to do with either inns or cathedrals.

627
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:34,500
Speaker 1: The inns and cathedrals themselves are kinda lame and they're just kinda tacked on.

628
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:37,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, let's talk about the cathedrals because they're like the obvious.

629
00:37:37,974 --> 00:37:39,460
Speaker 0: I think there's three of them?

630
00:37:39,822 --> 00:37:40,176
Speaker 1: Only two.

631
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:40,762
Speaker 0: Two?

632
00:37:40,782 --> 00:37:41,999
Speaker 0: I thought there were three.

633
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:43,459
Speaker 1: There's only two.

634
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,038
Speaker 1: Okay.

635
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,220
Speaker 1: They're a big city piece, meaning it's city on all sides, just a big city.

636
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,367
Speaker 0: Yep, there was never a tile like that in the original Carcassonne.

637
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:54,535
Speaker 0: So this tile is just all city.

638
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:56,860
Speaker 0: The only place you can put it is in the middle of a city.

639
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,520
Speaker 0: That means if you put this in a city, it becomes incredibly difficult to finish that city.

640
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:07,240
Speaker 1: It makes every tile in the city worth an extra point, which is huge.

641
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you finish a city that has a cathedral in it, you're gonna get a shit ton of points.

642
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:22,438
Speaker 1: Now, the drawback of the cathedral is that normally if the game ends and you have a big city that didn't finish, you get half the number of points you would have gotten if it had finished.

643
00:38:22,478 --> 00:38:23,540
Speaker 1: Kind of a consolation prize.

644
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:26,172
Speaker 1: If there's a cathedral in there, you don't get anything.

645
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:27,360
Speaker 1: It's all or nothing.

646
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:28,943
Speaker 0: It's like a big gamble.

647
00:38:29,044 --> 00:38:36,380
Speaker 0: If you put a cathedral in your own city, then you basically spend the rest of the game trying to finish it to get a shit ton of points and win.

648
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:46,360
Speaker 0: The more common strategy is to throw the cathedral in someone else's city, because then they have this guy stuck in the city and he's never gonna finish the city because it's impossible.

649
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,899
Speaker 1: And if he gets close, everyone will just keep trying to dick him.

650
00:38:49,380 --> 00:39:07,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, if he gets close to finishing the city, then other people will either jump into the city to get a share of the points, or they'll put roads and stuff in the way to prevent the city from ever finishing, and now he's spent all his tiles making one big city instead of making another city somewhere else that actually could have finished.

651
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,688
Speaker 1: Now, the inns do the exact same thing.

652
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:13,800
Speaker 1: the cathedral does, only to a road, and there are a lot of them.

653
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of inns.

654
00:39:15,163 --> 00:39:18,550
Speaker 0: So if you put an inn, it's just a little symbol next to a road.

655
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:23,319
Speaker 0: So let's say I'm making a road, and then I add another road to it that has an inn on it.

656
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,492
Speaker 0: The inn makes the whole road double in points, but if the road doesn't ever finish, I get zero points.

657
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:32,419
Speaker 0: Usually if a road doesn't finish, you still get a bunch of points for it.

658
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:37,388
Speaker 0: So, you know, no one ever puts an inn on someone else's road.

659
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:42,460
Speaker 0: Everyone puts an inn on their own road, and then they try to finish it, and other people try to prevent that road from finishing.

660
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:44,259
Speaker 0: If it's too long.

661
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,175
Speaker 1: And that's it.

662
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,342
Speaker 0: That's all Inns and Cathedrals does.

663
00:39:48,362 --> 00:40:00,340
Speaker 0: It improves the game a great deal, but make sure you're the master of regular Carcassonne before you use it, because you'll ruin a whole bunch of normal Carcassonne games if you start playing with Inns and Cathedrals right away.

664
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:00,758
Speaker 1: Yeah.

665
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,400
Speaker 1: Now, last and not least, and newest, is the tower.

666
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:09,300
Speaker 0: The first thing you gotta know about the tower is it comes with this tower.

667
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:12,477
Speaker 1: You can put all the tiles in it stacked up real nice.

668
00:40:12,517 --> 00:40:13,020
Speaker 1: It's kinda cool.

669
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:21,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't have this tower, then you play Carcassonne usually with all the tiles in a big pile, or just stacks on the table all around.

670
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,465
Speaker 0: And it's not really clean or good looking.

671
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:28,500
Speaker 0: It's like you make a big mess, and then you build the game right off the table, and all kinds of weird stuff happens.

672
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:30,560
Speaker 0: So this tower really makes things handy.

673
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, I basically bought the expansion only because it has this tower in it.

674
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:36,420
Speaker 1: I didn't really care what the tower expansion itself did.

675
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:36,724
Speaker 0: Mhm.

676
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:42,737
Speaker 1: And it changes the game in fundamental ways, but I think it's still a good game.

677
00:40:43,118 --> 00:40:43,640
Speaker 1: I still win.

678
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,539
Speaker 0: It's a good game, but Inns and Cathedrals is still the same game, but just a little extra stuff.

679
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,660
Speaker 0: With the tower, it's a different game, I think.

680
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,600
Speaker 1: Very simply, the tower adds the ability to directly affect other players in a negative way.

681
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,160
Speaker 0: Mhm.

682
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:03,619
Speaker 0: You basically build these little towers instead of putting guys out if you want to.

683
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:16,860
Speaker 1: Instead of just place a tile and then either put a dude on it or not put a dude on it, you now have the option to, instead of putting a dude out, take a tower piece and put it on any tower-ready tile on the board.

684
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,439
Speaker 1: Not just the one you just played, but any of them.

685
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:27,720
Speaker 1: And if you put that tower down, anyone within x-spaces of that tower, you can take their dude off and keep him hostage.

686
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:28,247
Speaker 0: Mhm.

687
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,700
Speaker 1: And then if they take one of your dudes off, there's a prisoner swap and you both get your dudes back.

688
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:39,420
Speaker 0: So what this game does is it allows you to remove someone else's guy from the board.

689
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:45,720
Speaker 0: So if someone puts a guy in a castle and is going to score a hajillion points, you just put a little tower down and you take his guy right off the board.

690
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:53,180
Speaker 0: Of course, they can't put the tower just anywhere, they can only put it on the special tower tiles that come with the expansion, but there are a lot of them.

691
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,260
Speaker 0: And it's really hard to position things where they cannot possibly be towered or not easily be towered.

692
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:07,900
Speaker 1: Yup, thus you either have to finish things quickly, go in with other people, or try various strategies to keep people from screwing with your guys.

693
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,060
Speaker 1: It basically destroys the farming market.

694
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:10,772
Speaker 1: Mhm.

695
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,480
Speaker 1: Because farmers now are really, really vulnerable.

696
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:15,079
Speaker 0: And they're really hard to put out.

697
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,600
Speaker 0: Like, you can try to keep putting farmers out there, but someone will just tower them away.

698
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,580
Speaker 0: You have to really be clever to get the farmers into a good position.

699
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,700
Speaker 1: Of course, it's very balanced because any time you put a tower out, you had to not put a dude out.

700
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:30,599
Speaker 1: And putting a dude out is key.

701
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:38,620
Speaker 0: Of course, the thing is, in normal Carcassonne, you don't put a dude out, you put a dude out less than half the time you put a tile out.

702
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,140
Speaker 0: Because every turn you put a tile, but less than half the time you put a dude.

703
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,607
Speaker 1: See, that's your problem with Carcassonne.

704
00:42:43,788 --> 00:42:46,280
Speaker 1: I almost always put a dude out, even if it's something crap.

705
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:53,680
Speaker 1: I have almost all my dudes out at all times, and I just cap off whatever they're on, even if they're little, and take the points, and then I put the dude back out.

706
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:55,190
Speaker 0: Oh, see, I don't do that.

707
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:56,120
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll try next time.

708
00:42:56,301 --> 00:42:57,018
Speaker 1: That's how I win.

709
00:42:57,423 --> 00:42:59,359
Speaker 0: Watch, I'll get punned next time when I try to do that.

710
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:08,130
Speaker 0: But yeah, whenever you would normally place a tile, but you wouldn't put a dude anyway, put a tower!

711
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,690
Speaker 0: Of course, you only have a limited number of towers, and the more players, the less towers you have.

712
00:43:13,111 --> 00:43:15,490
Speaker 1: And every time you tower someone, you've got one of their guys hostage.

713
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:18,810
Speaker 1: So now, you're a target for them because they want their dude back.

714
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of a great equalizer.

715
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:26,690
Speaker 0: If I keep screwing rim, rim has a big incentive to screw me instead of someone else.

716
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:38,150
Speaker 0: But, if I'm not way ahead of rim in the scoring, he might not want to go after me, but he needs his guys back, and uhh, it's just an equalizing factor there, which is kind of good.

717
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,810
Speaker 0: Prevents people from just going after the guy in first place a whole bunch.

718
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:43,905
Speaker 1: Even though you tried to do that anyway, and it had no effect.

719
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,526
Speaker 0: I was in first place, you all went after me, and I lost.

720
00:43:46,566 --> 00:43:47,010
Speaker 0: It worked great.

721
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,969
Speaker 1: No, we didn't use the towers to go after you.

722
00:43:49,591 --> 00:43:50,390
Speaker 0: No, no, no, you didn't.

723
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,825
Speaker 1: We used the often-held strategy of "make a

724
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:53,148
Speaker 1: king.".

725
00:43:53,651 --> 00:43:54,054
Speaker 0: Yup.

726
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:56,470
Speaker 0: The king of Carcassonne in the castle.

727
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:57,227
Speaker 1: Yes.

728
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,569
Speaker 0: With two cathedrals, I think?

729
00:43:59,953 --> 00:44:00,617
Speaker 1: No, only one.

730
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,990
Speaker 1: I had a cathedral just for me, and then Pete and I shared a cathedral.

731
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,110
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought there were two cathedrals in that one city.

732
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:06,869
Speaker 1: No, no, I don't think there were.

733
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:07,336
Speaker 0: Oh.

734
00:44:07,873 --> 00:44:08,350
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

735
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:08,948
Speaker 1: Alright.

736
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:32,210
Speaker 0: Anyway, real quick, king-making, it doesn't work in many games, but it works in- And you have the ability to help other players and hurt other players, and everyone knows what everyone's score is.

737
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:37,990
Speaker 1: You pick one other dude, or maybe two other dudes in the game, and you decide they are not going to win.

738
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,520
Speaker 1: I know they're not going to win.

739
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:40,710
Speaker 1: They're not smart enough to win.

740
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:47,970
Speaker 1: So what I'm going to do is team up with them, and I'll do things that benefit me and them, and they'll do things that benefit them and me.

741
00:44:48,651 --> 00:44:52,190
Speaker 1: And we'll push ourselves up at the expense of everyone else in the game.

742
00:44:52,392 --> 00:44:54,270
Speaker 0: The people who have a chance of competing with you.

743
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:58,270
Speaker 1: So now, it's really just a game between me and the people I made kings with.

744
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,950
Speaker 1: So we're the kings, and everyone else, it doesn't matter.

745
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,010
Speaker 1: And then I screw them at the critical moment.

746
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:06,010
Speaker 1: Or I just know that they won't be able to capitalize on that.

747
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,756
Speaker 0: So let's give an example.

748
00:45:07,836 --> 00:45:10,930
Speaker 0: It's a game between me, rim, Joe, and John.

749
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:16,230
Speaker 0: We know that Joe and John are probably going to kick my ass.

750
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,669
Speaker 0: Rim, he sucks, he can't win.

751
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:23,710
Speaker 0: So what I do is I get a whole bunch of victory points by teaming up with rim.

752
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,050
Speaker 0: Because Joe and John are the only people who can possibly beat me at this game.

753
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:32,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, like anytime one of us has a big city, he'll jump onto it, or help it finish, that sort of thing.

754
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,870
Speaker 0: So me and rim now have like 100 points each.

755
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,870
Speaker 0: And Joe and John basically can't win this game because they're so far behind.

756
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,350
Speaker 0: We teamed up and gave each other points, and it was great.

757
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:45,469
Speaker 0: Now I fuck rim in the ass and I win.

758
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:49,090
Speaker 0: Because Joe and John can't possibly win, they're way down there.

759
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:50,589
Speaker 0: So all they have to do is fuck rim.

760
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:58,550
Speaker 1: This doesn't work too well in a lot of games, because if you're playing with people who are all good, it still works, but it doesn't work in the same way.

761
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:04,050
Speaker 0: Because if rim was good, I'd be like, alright, Joe and John are better than rim, but rim's still good.

762
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,990
Speaker 0: I'll team up with rim, and oh, he fucked me first, dammit.

763
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:13,810
Speaker 1: And if it's four people who are all equal in skill, it's still a valid strategy, but at this point, all you're doing is increasing the odds of victory.

764
00:46:14,192 --> 00:46:16,866
Speaker 1: Because now you have a 50% chance of winning instead of a 25% chance.

765
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,910
Speaker 1: Because two people are now eliminated from the game.

766
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:27,110
Speaker 1: The only game I've ever seen it extremely effective in is El Grande, where it was pretty much the way to win.

767
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:28,897
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

768
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,710
Speaker 0: El Grande was the game of making the king.

769
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:32,550
Speaker 0: I mean, the game had a giant king in it.

770
00:46:32,711 --> 00:46:33,036
Speaker 1: It did.

771
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:33,909
Speaker 0: We should play the game.

772
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:35,228
Speaker 1: No, you couldn't.

773
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,050
Speaker 0: Do not touch the giant golden penis.

774
00:46:37,614 --> 00:46:38,790
Speaker 0: That is the rule of El Grande.

775
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:40,365
Speaker 1: Yeah.

776
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:41,173
Speaker 0: Yep.

777
00:46:41,396 --> 00:46:42,350
Speaker 0: And we're not joking either.

778
00:46:42,772 --> 00:46:44,201
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll do a show about that game.

779
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:45,045
Speaker 1: We gotta play it again.

780
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:45,749
Speaker 1: It's been a while.

781
00:46:46,692 --> 00:46:54,070
Speaker 0: Oh, in case people out there, I don't know if you know, but if you go to BoardGameGeek.com, you can look up all the board games that we talk about.

782
00:46:54,532 --> 00:46:56,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, I always link to them whenever we talk about them.

783
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there are pictures and all kinds of stuff.

784
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:06,630
Speaker 0: So if you're not sure if you're looking at the right game, go to FrontRowCrew.com, our website, and click on the links to the games, and you'll see all kinds of cool stuff.

785
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,386
Speaker 1: And all in all, I highly recommend Carcassonne.

786
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:09,910
Speaker 1: It's a great game.

787
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:19,270
Speaker 0: If you don't have Carcassonne, like, if you're new to German gaming, and you're just finding out about it because we talk about it, you want to get Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.

788
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:21,340
Speaker 0: Those are like the first two games you have to get.

789
00:47:21,582 --> 00:47:23,210
Speaker 0: We just never talked about Carcassonne before.

790
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:23,889
Speaker 1: Yep.

791
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,557
Speaker 0: Carcassonne does have some other expansions.

792
00:47:26,818 --> 00:47:30,070
Speaker 0: One of them that I know a lot about is The Princess and the Dragon.

793
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:41,350
Speaker 0: I think The Princess and the Dragon... I haven't read all the rules, but from what I understand, the dragon goes around eating farmers, and the princess stops the dragon.

794
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:42,452
Speaker 0: I don't know.

795
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:46,009
Speaker 0: I don't know how good it is because it's never played with it, so I don't know enough about it.

796
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,710
Speaker 0: However, it comes with a wooden dragon, which is more than enough.

797
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:50,231
Speaker 1: Great.

798
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,159
Speaker 1: Why don't we just find out what the rules are?

799
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,887
Speaker 1: We'll use that ship from Entdecker and...

800
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,690
Speaker 0: Because it doesn't look like a dragon.

801
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,010
Speaker 1: Whatever, it's a pirate ship.

802
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:57,592
Speaker 0: Shut up.

803
00:47:57,754 --> 00:47:59,170
Speaker 0: I think it also comes with some good tiles.

804
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:00,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll have to see.

805
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,042
Speaker 0: Like maybe a dragon nest?

806
00:48:02,345 --> 00:48:02,648
Speaker 0: Ooh.

807
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:04,009
Speaker 1: Ooh, piratin' nest.

808
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:04,967
Speaker 0: Piratin' nest.

809
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:14,979
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

810
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,590

817
00:48:41,153 --> 00:48:44,410
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

818
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:48,290
Speaker 0: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
