1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,486
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday June 10th.

2
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:12,289
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:14,216
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:19,619
Speaker 0: Tuesday tonight We talk about Super Dodgeball and Super Dodgeball brawlers.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:37,439
Speaker 1: Let's do this So as soon as we start doing the show Twice a week because you know we're sort of running out of things to talk about losing steam.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,572
Speaker 1: No, I think the steam bucket fills up crazy.

7
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:42,440
Speaker 0: that just proves what I'd suspect it all along.

8
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,360
Speaker 0: It's not that we're running out of things to talk about far be it.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,545
Speaker 0: That's not even like.

10
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:47,710
Speaker 0: that's not even on the table.

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,080
Speaker 0: as one of the reasons why we had to slow down the show temporarily.

12
00:00:50,882 --> 00:01:02,391
Speaker 0: I think it's just that we don't have enough time to be awake enough to do the show the way we'd want if we continue to do it four nights a week, but Because we're doing it at this reduced schedule now.

13
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:08,177
Speaker 0: I still have all the stuff I want to say, but I don't have enough shows to say it in.

14
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:11,717
Speaker 1: It's definitely kind of just.

15
00:01:11,757 --> 00:01:12,040
Speaker 1: you know.

16
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:16,668
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's ironic or not, but we haven't done a show in six days Which I think is the longest.

17
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:28,680
Speaker 1: it's like rain on your wedding day yeah, as long as stretch of no shows and quite a very long time and Suddenly we've got mocha to talk about we've got iphones to talk about we've got shit all over the place.

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,919
Speaker 1: That's happening everywhere in all of geekdom.

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,371
Speaker 1: I think we've only got two shows and none of them.

20
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:36,840
Speaker 1: we really needed a Monday show, but we didn't have one.

21
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:42,499
Speaker 0: I think what it really proves Is that the only thing preventing geek nights from being four nights a week is the fact that we have day jobs.

22
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,785
Speaker 1: Yes, that could be true.

23
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,390
Speaker 0: geek nights was somehow my job.

24
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,060
Speaker 0: You can bet that there would be like ten shows a week.

25
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:56,143
Speaker 1: I don't know ten shows, but there will be four geek night shows and maybe other shows in addition Shows.

26
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:57,128
Speaker 1: one of them would be right.

27
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,093
Speaker 1: there are ten nights.

28
00:01:58,194 --> 00:01:59,340
Speaker 1: We can't do ten geek nights.

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,593
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean unless suddenly we add you know the three extra days to the week.

30
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:07,120
Speaker 1: You know Scott day Scott or day and Caturday.

31
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,607
Speaker 0: Caturday's already a day.

32
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,700
Speaker 0: it comes after Friday and before Friday.

33
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:16,789
Speaker 0: Okay Anyway, so I have another quick announcement.

34
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:20,760
Speaker 0: We'll have a lot more about this in the upcoming weeks, and I don't know months.

35
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:30,320
Speaker 0: It's not like it's exactly on the near horizon But we've said before and we're saying again geek nights is going to the penny arcade expo in Seattle this summer.

36
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,850
Speaker 1: We're going no matter what we will be there Maybe just cuz.

37
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:42,280
Speaker 0: I've been dealing with emails and stuff a lot lately But I almost said penny arcade is coming to geek nights, then I realized that that is not in any way true.

38
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:44,428
Speaker 0: I wish that was true But no we're good.

39
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:52,800
Speaker 0: not only we're going to be at PAX And I'm going to talk a lot more about this once we confirm a few of the special details that are not quite public yet.

40
00:02:53,322 --> 00:03:01,313
Speaker 0: But we're not just going to PAX as rim and Scott We're going to fax as rim and Scott VIPs because we're totally running a panel.

41
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,035
Speaker 1: awesome.

42
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:03,860
Speaker 1: one panel gets you VIP status.

43
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:04,578
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

44
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:15,558
Speaker 0: You know I got to say penny arcade the most professional professional conventions in terms of dealing with us as like guests or as Staff or as talent or panelists or anything like that?

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,919
Speaker 0: Otakons way up there like they're really good at that and katsu khan is does a pretty good job.

46
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:32,180
Speaker 0: But the penny arcade expo has farmed away with the possible exception of the for-profit New York comic-con New York anime festival been the most professional in terms of their dealings with us.

47
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:41,516
Speaker 0: From what I'm feeling is that I think they're twice as professional as the New York and in festival comic-con now because there was It's a different kind date the New York comic-con anime fest and all that are like.

48
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,385
Speaker 0: we are Professional in the.

49
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:46,600
Speaker 0: we are making money off of this way and everything has to be perfect.

50
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,088
Speaker 1: But I mean you said they replied to the email like ten minutes.

51
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:49,710
Speaker 0: Well.

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,192
Speaker 0: That's not.

53
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:52,640
Speaker 0: that's not necessarily a sign of professional.

54
00:03:52,941 --> 00:04:03,860
Speaker 0: Yes, no because I can tell you this and like at IBM if you responded to an email right away And you did this all the time It was pretty much assumed that you weren't doing your real work, and we're just kind of dicking around in your office.

55
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,255
Speaker 1: This was usually true, but what if your job is email?

56
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:08,400
Speaker 0: No one's job is email.

57
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:16,365
Speaker 0: I get is if you're like you know Mention I'll tell you a little bit about IVM's corporate culture And it's I can't.

58
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:20,819
Speaker 0: this is not a an indictment of IBM because most large tech companies are like this.

59
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,833
Speaker 0: I Gained an average of 10 to 40 unread emails a day.

60
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,560
Speaker 0: now that doesn't mean I got 40 emails a day.

61
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:29,594
Speaker 0: That means all of the emails I got every day.

62
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:33,758
Speaker 0: 10 to 40 of them I did not read and that meant that they never got read.

63
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,786
Speaker 1: Wow, yeah, but I'm saying is that if you're say the panels person for a convention that only happens You know like one weekend out of the year.

64
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:48,690
Speaker 1: your primary work is mostly reading and writing emails And then you know other than that.

65
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,280
Speaker 1: It's like figuring things out on paper.

66
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:59,680
Speaker 0: I can say this this is the second time that a panel person has Responded to me with the phrase we would be honored.

67
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:10,000
Speaker 0: I am very happy about this, but now the panel We are running will involve Dungeons and Dragons in some way and other tabletop role-playing systems.

68
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,771
Speaker 0: but I'm going to be sparse on the details until we Finalize more of them.

69
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:15,518
Speaker 0: I'll leave it at that.

70
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:20,520
Speaker 0: We're going to be at penny arcade Expo in a big way, and I highly recommend you all be there.

71
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:32,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, and since you won't have any tables or anything like that We're pretty much gonna run this panel and the rest of the time The packs is pretty much the only con in a live for a long time.

72
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,240
Speaker 0: We're not only will be able to see us do something But you'll have a chance of hanging out with us or talking to us for more than 30 seconds.

73
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:39,726
Speaker 1: Oh, and it's Labor Day weekend.

74
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:40,409
Speaker 0: Yes.

75
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,060
Speaker 1: Oh, and it will probably gonna fly out like Wednesday night.

76
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,560
Speaker 1: So if anyone like Thursday wants to chill in Seattle, that's that's what we're gonna be doing.

77
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:55,491
Speaker 0: Yes, and to all the people who try to see us at all these anime cons like katsu khan and kinetic on It won't be like that where you're like see us running by and you yell.

78
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:57,277
Speaker 0: Hey, we'll actually have time to chill.

79
00:05:57,297 --> 00:06:01,340
Speaker 1: Yep I don't know what else to say about it right now, except I'm excited.

80
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:02,284
Speaker 0: I've what I.

81
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:06,080
Speaker 1: except for now all the West Coast people can shut up cuz like hey we come to the West Coast.

82
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,215
Speaker 1: You can't say all the East Coast is too far.

83
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:16,880
Speaker 0: I can't come over Meanwhile to certain people who do a webcomic copped out of coming to Otacon and then don't really come to the East Coast.

84
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we're bringing it to.

85
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:20,740
Speaker 1: you went to the Baltimore comic-con a couple times.

86
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,129
Speaker 0: Whatever Baltimore comic-con would just be depressing.

87
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,700
Speaker 0: as much as I like comics just one room out of the whole.

88
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:31,720
Speaker 0: Being at the Baltimore Convention Center and not having the entire convention center would be frightening.

89
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:34,082
Speaker 1: It would quite be quite eerie I believe.

90
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:34,906
Speaker 0: not just that.

91
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:37,717
Speaker 0: the fact that you at Otacon and it's not just like it'd be sort of like.

92
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:43,951
Speaker 1: I imagine it's be Sort of like, you know Thursday reg at Otacon where it's sort of like activity in one area but the rest of the thing is like.

93
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,760
Speaker 0: But even Thursday reg at Otacon has like 10,000 people standing outside making a ruckus.

94
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they're outside but you know, it's like they're feeling in the convention center would be similar.

95
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:54,720
Speaker 0: see to me.

96
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,691
Speaker 0: I think being it at any convention at the BCC like that That's so small would be like when I was a kid.

97
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,680
Speaker 1: first of all, it's not worth the trip to Baltimore.

98
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,446
Speaker 0: Baltimore is not that far.

99
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:06,940
Speaker 1: It's still too far for a tiny convention.

100
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:08,467
Speaker 0: It's not really not much further.

101
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:11,120
Speaker 0: that actually is about the same distance all told is getting a Rochester.

102
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,994
Speaker 1: Hey Rochester is not worth it for a tiny convention either.

103
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:16,426
Speaker 0: No Toricon but that's that's.

104
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,499
Speaker 0: that's a very near and dear to our heart convention.

105
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,379
Speaker 0: Once I've been to almost all of them.

106
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:28,060
Speaker 0: Yeah I Founded the thing that eventually was gotten rid of and replaced by the thing that became Toricon.

107
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can say that much.

108
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:37,054
Speaker 0: but I think being it like the BCC on one of those small comms would be like when I Was a kid and I was at Cedar Point and I'd be in the fantasy land of.

109
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:58,700
Speaker 0: I am in roller coaster heaven but then I'd be at the top of the roller coaster and there's that kind of Moment of pause between when the click click click click click stops before you go over the edge When I'd look to my left and I'd see over Lake Erie all the normal people in the normal buildings working And the real world would like intrude into my happiness for that brief second.

110
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:06,972
Speaker 0: It's like it's like seeing the janitor when you're at an amusement park But the janitor is usually like in a costume or something depends on the amusement park.

111
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:13,104
Speaker 0: I guess Wildwood's janitors are usually well anyway We'll leave it at.

112
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:16,200
Speaker 0: that is we're in Canada suits, so I'm gonna get right into this.

113
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,019
Speaker 0: This is not my news, but I have to say something about this.

114
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:28,139
Speaker 0: We can now look at the cover for Soul Caliber 4 And I think Kotaku said it better than I ever could have said.

115
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:29,545
Speaker 0: rest in peace.

116
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:34,544
Speaker 0: Soul Caliber 1998 to 2008 wrong They actually the reason.

117
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:39,299
Speaker 1: now you I'm saying wrong which means you think I might disagree that Soul Caliber is dead.

118
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,159
Speaker 0: No, you're saying that it died long before.

119
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:45,048
Speaker 0: You are wise.

120
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:46,616
Speaker 0: I guess he got shy vote, I don't know.

121
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:52,996
Speaker 1: Soul Caliber 3 I mean some people say it's okay But I highly doubt that Soul Caliber 3 is anything like Soul Caliber 2.

122
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:56,689
Speaker 0: so as far as I'm concerned Soul Caliber 3 was not a bad game.

123
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,595
Speaker 0: It was just not better than 2.

124
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:00,883
Speaker 0: Yes, so I know people out there right now.

125
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:01,626
Speaker 1: We're going over image Scott.

126
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:02,770
Speaker 1: You don't know anything.

127
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,540
Speaker 0: You know what the majority people out there are going huh?

128
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:11,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you need any proof of that go to any convention right?

129
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,544
Speaker 0: Katsucon was a good example.

130
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:18,721
Speaker 0: You'll see a lot more people playing Soul Caliber 2 than Soul Caliber 3.

131
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus Soul Caliber 3 didn't wasn't on.

132
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,680
Speaker 1: you know every system like 2 was which really actually hurt it in a ways.

133
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:34,346
Speaker 1: Yeah But Soul Caliber Soul edge the business Soul Caliber the business Soul Caliber on the Dreamcast the business Soul Caliber 2 Double business.

134
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:35,048
Speaker 0: one of them.

135
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,060
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say is the best the best 3d fighting game ever.

136
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:40,370
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'd say that because it's what's better.

137
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,275
Speaker 1: I don't know.

138
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:44,166
Speaker 1: 3d fighting games See actually a three.

139
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:47,799
Speaker 1: it can't be one of those 3d fighting games like virtual fighter one that wasn't actually 3d.

140
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,824
Speaker 1: It just looked 3d.

141
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:50,413
Speaker 0: What about Bushido blade 3?

142
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:54,526
Speaker 1: Bushido blades not good And it's definitely not as good as Soul Caliber 2.

143
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,472
Speaker 0: Well one fuck you and two.

144
00:09:57,214 --> 00:10:04,469
Speaker 0: but now the cover of Soul Caliber 4. alright It's got Darth Vader on it.

145
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:05,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it's.

146
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,520
Speaker 0: it is actually Darth Vader.

147
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:09,133
Speaker 1: Usually this is the kind of it's.

148
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:10,080
Speaker 1: it's weird, right?

149
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,133
Speaker 1: It's like when someone throws a character like that in there.

150
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:17,900
Speaker 0: if I was 14, no No, if I was 13, this would be the best like alright.

151
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,604
Speaker 0: So think about it.

152
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:19,951
Speaker 1: when they put link in there.

153
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:28,320
Speaker 1: Everyone was like hell's yeah And that sort of encouraged them to do that again, and they they basically went for they went straight for the throat.

154
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:34,800
Speaker 0: Know what they did in the in the immortal words of Rama Sharma.

155
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:37,387
Speaker 0: They they tried to do too much with it.

156
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:38,731
Speaker 1: they shared it.

157
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,780
Speaker 1: they basically we said well putting link in there worked.

158
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:46,075
Speaker 1: Let's just go for the biggest what guns we can now Darth Vader.

159
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,560
Speaker 1: You can't get much bigger guns than that.

160
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:48,504
Speaker 0: It's been a while.

161
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,331
Speaker 0: So I should probably explain the Rama Sharma.

162
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:51,536
Speaker 0: You tried to do too much with it.

163
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:56,076
Speaker 0: very briefly So at IBM, there's this awesome dude named Rama Sharma and I worked with him.

164
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:56,760
Speaker 0: He was awesome.

165
00:10:57,081 --> 00:11:02,140
Speaker 0: He was Indian and he played tennis and he was all cool and I usually went to lunch with him in the eunuch Santa.

166
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:16,577
Speaker 0: but Whenever we play tennis or actually whatever anything was happening anytime someone obviously put did something that reeked of effort or Tried to do more than they probably should have tried to do.

167
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,338
Speaker 0: like, you know We're in a tennis match and I could have just hit it.

168
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:26,439
Speaker 0: I could have just hit it over the net but no I tried to slam it over the net and instead I slammed it into The net and lost the game.

169
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:32,583
Speaker 0: He would look at me and he put his finger out and he'd waggle it in my face and he'd say you know Your problem is.

170
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:34,732
Speaker 0: you see you you tried.

171
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,440
Speaker 0: you tried to do too much with it.

172
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,971
Speaker 0: If you had you done less you might have made it.

173
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:41,671
Speaker 0: but no you tried to do too much and I got the point And you lose.

174
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:50,840
Speaker 1: yep If you try to do a fancy move But it that causes you to fail in a situation where you could have pulled off the simple move that would have guaranteed non-failure.

175
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:52,808
Speaker 1: That is when you tried to do too much with it.

176
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,695
Speaker 0: So Darth Vader too much.

177
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,502
Speaker 1: That's too much basically I see.

178
00:11:56,522 --> 00:12:08,580
Speaker 1: the thing is why didn't they realize right that in this whole caliber too when they threw in the extra characters That only people only like the link people hated the spawn and the whatever his face was right?

179
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:09,744
Speaker 0: And I was.

180
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:10,526
Speaker 0: why didn't they?

181
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:19,900
Speaker 0: was that more a product of the fact that link is so independently popular Coupled with the fact that it was like the first fighting game on the Gamecube?

182
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:22,126
Speaker 1: I think that might have had.

183
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:27,880
Speaker 1: there were there many factors the reasons why link was accepted and people were overjoyed at that inclusion.

184
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:35,100
Speaker 1: However, why didn't they just like, you know put out like a little focus group about this Darth Vader Yoda thing before they did it?

185
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:37,100
Speaker 0: It's it's one of those things where link is like.

186
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:41,568
Speaker 0: All right I kind of understand and it did work But it just even.

187
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:46,469
Speaker 0: when I heard that Darth Vader and Yoda were gonna be in Soul Calibur I didn't think it was a joke.

188
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,400
Speaker 0: I assumed it was a joke.

189
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:56,067
Speaker 0: I was absolutely sure that it was fake and then when it was until it was actually officially announced I did not even consider it.

190
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:58,036
Speaker 1: Well, that was that we talked about that for quite a while.

191
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:58,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, not your news.

192
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:04,075
Speaker 0: So anyway, the cover to Soul Calibur 4 is epically fail.

193
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:07,743
Speaker 1: It is quite the epic fail All right.

194
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:09,912
Speaker 0: Also the lightsaber should be cutting through that sword.

195
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:10,353
Speaker 0: Good God.

196
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:18,039
Speaker 1: Anyway, so anyway If we did a Monday show yesterday, you probably would have talked about iPhones and such for a long time.

197
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:19,626
Speaker 0: I'm probably gonna buy one.

198
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:24,650
Speaker 1: I'm probably going to also but more on that on a Monday My blackberry and I'm gonna get rid of it.

199
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,357
Speaker 0: I've had it for one like six months.

200
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:26,920
Speaker 1: That's all right.

201
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,588
Speaker 1: You didn't pay for it.

202
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:34,758
Speaker 1: now regardless I can talk about iPhones today because they announced many games for the new iPhones.

203
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:36,601
Speaker 1: you see and Let's see.

204
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:37,645
Speaker 1: They got the monkey ball.

205
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:40,475
Speaker 1: They got this other game called Pangeas some other.

206
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:41,940
Speaker 1: the company is Pangea software.

207
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,999
Speaker 1: They have a game called enigma and there's a game called chromag rally, right?

208
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,187
Speaker 1: And basically what's going on here?

209
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:50,560
Speaker 0: It chromags like the thing that ruined sliders.

210
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:51,525
Speaker 1: I don't know.

211
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:53,396
Speaker 0: Is that a sliders game?

212
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:54,060
Speaker 1: I don't know.

213
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,689
Speaker 1: I think it's a racing game of like cavemen.

214
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:58,692
Speaker 1: You're like chromagnon.

215
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,138
Speaker 1: Ah, no, I'm not sure.

216
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:01,920
Speaker 1: I didn't look at it.

217
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,516
Speaker 1: All I see is the name here, right?

218
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:22,080
Speaker 1: but basically the iPhone is looking to be sort of a gaming platform right and How I think this is gonna go right is first of all, this is not competing with DS's and PSP's Even though the graphics look better than DS but a little less than PSP, right?

219
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,169
Speaker 1: This is not going competing in those marketplaces.

220
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:33,460
Speaker 1: What this is competing with right is not so much Games on other cell phones because people buy games for whatever cell phone they have right?

221
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,277
Speaker 1: It's competing for the developers of cell phone games.

222
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:45,189
Speaker 1: you see The people whose job it is to make cell phone games Right are going to choose to.

223
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:52,860
Speaker 1: instead of making a Java cell phone game They are going to choose instead to make an iPhone cell phone game or both.

224
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,744
Speaker 0: I choose you.

225
00:14:53,764 --> 00:15:09,934
Speaker 1: All right, but the iPhone has features such as touchscreen and accelerometers where people are going to make iPhone cell phone games that are not going to work in any other phone and Thus all these developers of cell phone games spend their time making iPhone games.

226
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,700
Speaker 1: other cell phones won't have so many games.

227
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:18,940
Speaker 0: The iPhone will look pretty hot compared to those other cell phones Never mind the fact that I was sold that I could have the Cisco VPN and an SSH client.

228
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:28,660
Speaker 1: Yeah now here is here's one thing about the the iPhone games that sort of make me a little iffy here and I'm probably not gonna buy Any iPhone games even if some of them are pretty good, huh?

229
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:38,302
Speaker 1: Basically a lot of these games are using the accelerometers and the iPhones that you can sort of tilt it Right, and you might think that makes sense, especially for monkey ball the first game They showed.

230
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:43,900
Speaker 0: my one concern is much like trying to play certain games on the DS in public places.

231
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:46,893
Speaker 0: You either feel stupid or end up waggling around like an idiot.

232
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,520
Speaker 1: No, that's that's not my concern.

233
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:55,996
Speaker 1: No, my concern is that notice how the DS uses the touchscreen only whereas the Wii has the waggling All right.

234
00:15:56,722 --> 00:16:05,539
Speaker 1: If you put the waggling in the DS this problem happens and that while you waggle You're actually waggling the screen at the same time.

235
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:16,382
Speaker 1: That's going to make for a very bad game If I have to tilt the screen forward to move the monkey ball forward and now I can't see the screen Problem.

236
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:16,983
Speaker 0: Hello.

237
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:19,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, same time you could you could.

238
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:32,540
Speaker 0: I feel like that sort of control could be used subtly to great effect But if overused well Too much require a great deal of calibration to make sure that you don't have to move the screen very far.

239
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,320
Speaker 1: But then you have these very tight controls that might be too tight, you know, it's it's gonna be really tricky there.

240
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,028
Speaker 1: But I guess touchscreen games could be fun.

241
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:42,660
Speaker 1: little touchscreen Tetris could be okay if you're bored or whatever.

242
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,799
Speaker 1: But really if I'm looking for gaming, I'll just whip up my DS.

243
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:51,226
Speaker 1: You know the iPhone won't have the sort of local wireless multiplayer The DS has.

244
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:53,619
Speaker 1: it won't have the two screens the DS has.

245
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:55,646
Speaker 0: yes Remember that the touchscreen is not.

246
00:16:55,707 --> 00:17:03,420
Speaker 1: what made the DS the amazing at least not to people have the tactile You know arrows and buttons the DS has which are essential for many many games.

247
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:04,827
Speaker 0: Yes But the thing is you don't.

248
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:14,041
Speaker 0: could be really really good on The iPhone would be adventure games like a little Phoenix right would be okay and real-time or turn-based strategy games That'd be okay.

249
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:24,900
Speaker 0: because this that sort of interface games where it's not there's there's different game control and the idioms like Mario games and platformers that sort of thing won't work at all because you really do need those buttons.

250
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:30,566
Speaker 0: But idioms like I have menus and I'm clicking on things work real Well, which is yeah all good.

251
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:36,168
Speaker 0: for rim who thought Gemfire was one of the best games ever a Phoenix Right would work and say an Advance Wars might work.

252
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,472
Speaker 1: The thing is right.

253
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:42,364
Speaker 1: even with an Advance Wars the single-player be okay Multiplayer no go.

254
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:56,294
Speaker 1: unless they set up some sort of Bluetooth gaming which is I don't think it's gonna be fast enough Some sort of ad-hoc Wi-Fi I don't know, but the DS Completely a win for at least for me personally was the local wireless.

255
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:58,120
Speaker 0: Everything else is just a okay, whatever.

256
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,320
Speaker 1: But the local wireless revolutionized gaming for me and it could theoretically do a local wireless because does have Wi-Fi in it.

257
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,226
Speaker 1: Yes, and you know, what is that?

258
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,220
Speaker 1: gonna disconnect you from the Internet's, you know?

259
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,440
Speaker 1: And then maybe they could do internet Wi-Fi, which actually be pretty cool.

260
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:19,980
Speaker 1: I doubt they're gonna let you play games live over the 3g even if it's possible You know because they don't want you using up all that crazy bandwidth or whatever because they're assholes.

261
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:24,703
Speaker 1: But yeah, iPhone gaming might be something I really do.

262
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:28,939
Speaker 1: I think I think the iPhone should really would be a hit in terms of gaming.

263
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:32,200
Speaker 1: is If someone who made like MMOs, right?

264
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:39,708
Speaker 1: Let's say Blizzard made like not a full-on World of Warcraft client for the iPhone But sort of like a mini World of Warcraft client.

265
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:43,040
Speaker 1: We're like you could do a few World of Warcraft things on your iPhone.

266
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:45,689
Speaker 1: So like the crazy addicts that would make mad moneys.

267
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:50,384
Speaker 1: not that I want that but you know that make bad moneys Right.

268
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,479
Speaker 0: So I actually have some news.

269
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,259
Speaker 0: Luckily, we don't need to talk about it for a long time.

270
00:18:55,561 --> 00:19:00,879
Speaker 0: I think you all know my opinions on this and also coming around to this Scott side of things there, huh?

271
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,374
Speaker 1: Don't just keep going.

272
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:08,600
Speaker 0: no No, cuz the thing is I don't think that this hurts the thing that is being applied to in any way.

273
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:12,973
Speaker 1: Well, it hurts it in one sense and it helps it in another side.

274
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:20,292
Speaker 0: now the thing that the reason I don't want to talk about it a lot is because while This is totally a rumor and I have not is it.

275
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:21,135
Speaker 1: I thought it was real.

276
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:22,320
Speaker 0: Where did you see that?

277
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:22,982
Speaker 1: I don't know.

278
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:24,749
Speaker 1: I just sort of saw words on the Internet's.

279
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,151
Speaker 1: Yes.

280
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:27,280
Speaker 0: I've seen words about this all over the place.

281
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:39,540
Speaker 0: However, I did not look too deeply into finding out if it is true or not because the original thing I read way back was based mostly on a couple of screenshots and some other speculation.

282
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,564
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.

283
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:42,667
Speaker 1: So so this is now real.

284
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:51,880
Speaker 0: and well this mayor this may have been verified since I looked but Going two nights a week does not mean I'm gonna put any more due diligence into my news than I have before.

285
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,523
Speaker 1: There you go.

286
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:55,999
Speaker 1: However spirit I'm gonna talk about don't try to do too much of it.

287
00:19:57,388 --> 00:19:57,819
Speaker 0: You know what?

288
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:06,470
Speaker 0: I think you're trying to use the try to do too much with it too much and thus are trying to do too much with Perhaps perhaps Indeed so quite quiet.

289
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,097
Speaker 1: You're trying to do too much with these.

290
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:12,791
Speaker 0: sure Supposing World of Warcraft were to get achievements.

291
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:15,160
Speaker 1: This is the whole game just achievements already.

292
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:19,880
Speaker 0: So this enters this delicious world of meta that I. it's so wonderful.

293
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:24,413
Speaker 0: It's so meta that there would be achievements in an achievement based game.

294
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,780
Speaker 1: I mean pretty much the game is achievements.

295
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,325
Speaker 1: It's like kill the guy.

296
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:31,053
Speaker 1: get this item kill that guy get this.

297
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,845
Speaker 0: no, no, no, that's not a while works at all Uh-huh.

298
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,957
Speaker 0: You obviously have never played.

299
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:38,559
Speaker 0: Wow Get a bunch of people together kill all these guys.

300
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,187
Speaker 0: What if you will get an item?

301
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,979
Speaker 0: do the exact same thing until everyone gets the item?

302
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,695
Speaker 1: That's even worse.

303
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,875
Speaker 0: But supposing that were you to get to level 15 without dying you would get 50 something points.

304
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:53,199
Speaker 0: or were you to?

305
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:59,120
Speaker 0: Complete 10 quests in the howling fjord you would get 50 something points.

306
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:02,430
Speaker 1: But isn't the game already give you something if you complete a quest?

307
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:06,157
Speaker 0: Yes, it gives you something but it doesn't give you something points.

308
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:08,899
Speaker 1: See, that's the thing with all these games.

309
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:12,451
Speaker 1: Really on the fundamental levels that they're not games of winning and losing.

310
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:16,986
Speaker 1: they are games of do stuff and gets and get Meaningless rewards no matter what you do.

311
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:17,769
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

312
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,120
Speaker 0: It's it's no different than SimCity in that regard.

313
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:23,286
Speaker 0: Now it's don't.

314
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:24,553
Speaker 1: you can lose it SimCity.

315
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:25,599
Speaker 0: no you can't.

316
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,387
Speaker 1: yeah You can be no matter how bad.

317
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:28,130
Speaker 1: you could run out of money.

318
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:34,660
Speaker 0: No because no matter how badly you're going No, you can just bulldoze everything down to like a couple of little zones.

319
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,770
Speaker 0: You're one little power plant and then leave the game on for like a week or two And then you'll get enough money back to start playing again.

320
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the year will advance so far into the cares.

321
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:46,509
Speaker 0: That doesn't do anything.

322
00:21:47,012 --> 00:21:48,039
Speaker 0: You're doesn't mean Jack.

323
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:57,084
Speaker 1: The thing is if SimCity wasn't a broken game It's it's theoretically at least a game of design and you have to come up with a better design That works.

324
00:21:57,144 --> 00:21:58,389
Speaker 0: the problem is it's a game of.

325
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:00,396
Speaker 0: there is a perfect design simply implemented.

326
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:01,300
Speaker 1: That is a problem.

327
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,252
Speaker 1: Yes, if it was much more complicated and difficult to come up with a good wasn't?

328
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:08,203
Speaker 0: then it would just be a sandbox with multiple paths.

329
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:12,865
Speaker 1: at least the sandbox is better than a you know a Manual labor for meaningless.

330
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:17,780
Speaker 0: I don't share your vitriol when it comes to World of Warcraft because I don't see you playing it.

331
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:18,422
Speaker 1: Well, there's

332
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:35,360
Speaker 0: the thing if you remove the grind from it and you just look at playing the game Like let's say I could just if I if I was subscribed to Wow I could anytime arbitrarily pick a level pick a class pick a race Pick all my equipment and then do whatever raids I want to do with all my friends who have picked similar levels.

333
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:39,860
Speaker 0: Then the game would probably be pretty damn fun and I could see playing it with my friends.

334
00:22:40,302 --> 00:22:42,273
Speaker 1: I don't think so because then what would be?

335
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:43,460
Speaker 1: you're doing this thing, right?

336
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:45,928
Speaker 1: You just picked the best equipment.

337
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:46,551
Speaker 1: there is you.

338
00:22:46,611 --> 00:22:50,043
Speaker 1: it's basically no different than the World of Warcraft card game Which is you?

339
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:54,580
Speaker 1: you know, if you have enough money, you can pick whatever cards you want and it's just a matter.

340
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,390
Speaker 1: It's basically rock-paper-scissors, but you see the scissors.

341
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,297
Speaker 1: I just decide to throw rock.

342
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:00,902
Speaker 0: Not really How?

343
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:06,620
Speaker 0: not really because in this case, it's kind of like playing Team Fortress where alright, we're all gonna do this thing.

344
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,838
Speaker 0: I mean basically once I'd done every raid a couple of times I would have no reason to play again.

345
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:13,430
Speaker 0: But at least I wouldn't have to level up to get to that point.

346
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,980
Speaker 0: because then it's alright, let's go on this mission.

347
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,840
Speaker 0: It's a lot like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles get all your friends together and you go on this kind of mission together.

348
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:23,094
Speaker 0: When you're done, you're done and hey, we beat it now.

349
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:24,000
Speaker 0: Let's do the next one.

350
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,370
Speaker 0: let's all meet on Saturday and do some other one.

351
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:42,900
Speaker 0: if you remove all the doing something more than once in order to get items or Doing something more than once in order to get levels or basically any sort of non arbitrary advancement I would be all about Wow until I'd done every raid a couple time.

352
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:53,390
Speaker 1: Now the thing about the diff the thing that found all these Crystal Chronicles is a good example because it's basically Wow Except there is one key difference that separates it from Wow Which is why the newer Crystal Chronicles is the suck.

353
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:55,459
Speaker 1: is that it actually the whole?

354
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:03,807
Speaker 1: mechanic of having the secret information based on which player you are and one person has the map and someone else is The only thing that made that.

355
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:06,056
Speaker 1: that was the only thing that made that game worthwhile.

356
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:07,020
Speaker 0: I don't think so at all.

357
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,780
Speaker 1: No, that is the only reason that that game was not terrible.

358
00:24:12,522 --> 00:24:24,980
Speaker 1: I the fact that it forced you to have the set up this sort of interaction between the people and in this Cooperation whereas and Wow, it's pretty much you just learn the exact job You're supposed to do and then you just do the job repeatedly.

359
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:33,654
Speaker 0: But you can do the exact same thing in Crystal Chronicles because those maps and all that in secret information Was in the end useless and all it did was make the game faster.

360
00:24:33,694 --> 00:24:34,799
Speaker 0: It didn't actually help you ever.

361
00:24:35,562 --> 00:24:37,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, it did cuz it didn't it did.

362
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,823
Speaker 0: all you had to do was always turn left and you would always solve every puzzle and Get to the end.

363
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:45,140
Speaker 0: all the maps did was give you guys people an excuse to talk to each other.

364
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:46,080
Speaker 0: What made that game?

365
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,415
Speaker 0: Great was the fact that you get four friends together and you would be in this shit together.

366
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:53,100
Speaker 0: and also it ended.

367
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:57,360
Speaker 0: No, well ending is important too, but it had a good theme and had good style.

368
00:24:57,642 --> 00:25:00,480
Speaker 0: And it was you take four people and you play together.

369
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:15,900
Speaker 0: I also feel that Crystal Chronicles was only worth playing if you played through it in like one or two goes like a group of people one group of people all the way through and also if you ignored pretty much all the Advancements of the game other than the advancement that occurs naturally in the course of playing.

370
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:22,540
Speaker 0: I feel as though World of Warcraft would be as fun as Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

371
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:31,259
Speaker 0: If I did not have to ever Level and no one else ever had to level and you could never get anything that affected the game in the game.

372
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,680
Speaker 1: That would make it a little bit better, but it still would not make it good.

373
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,322
Speaker 1: Why not?

374
00:25:36,623 --> 00:25:38,027
Speaker 1: because there's still you're not doing it.

375
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:39,833
Speaker 1: All you're doing is manual labor.

376
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:42,200
Speaker 0: You realize the only manual labor is the grind.

377
00:25:43,603 --> 00:25:45,840
Speaker 1: So be what so but do it's no different.

378
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,671
Speaker 1: So the only difference is I'm doing the same exact labor only now.

379
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:50,457
Speaker 1: numbers don't go up because I control the numb.

380
00:25:50,478 --> 00:25:56,350
Speaker 0: doing any one Raid or any one part of the game once would be fun No less fun than doing any one level in Crystal Chronicles.

381
00:25:56,952 --> 00:25:59,540
Speaker 1: doing the same with the levels in Crystal Chronicles is annoying.

382
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:04,540
Speaker 1: The fun part was trying to figure out where to go and then, you know, try to figure out.

383
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:11,198
Speaker 1: Okay, you take this, you know competing for all those the items at the end like oh Are you gonna take that one and you know sort of bickering with each other?

384
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,021
Speaker 1: I don't know.

385
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:13,989
Speaker 1: actual game itself didn't offer anything.

386
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,615
Speaker 0: I kind of disagree again.

387
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:16,097
Speaker 0: It was okay.

388
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:27,860
Speaker 0: I don't understand why you hate like why you get so freaked out about World of Warcraft every time it comes up and you get So angry about it and just vitriol left and right because I don't I don't like I had this.

389
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,160
Speaker 1: It's just World of Warcraft happens to be the most popular big phenomena.

390
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,008
Speaker 1: So that's why it gets most of the vitriol.

391
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:35,293
Speaker 1: I feel the same way about all.

392
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:44,100
Speaker 0: every game that has the same Characteristics and yet you want to play other get like some board games we have that are just worse in many regards gameplay wise.

393
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:48,073
Speaker 0: But anyway, I feel as though wow wouldn't be that bad.

394
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:51,948
Speaker 0: and my question to wild players I'll end it on this at least to all of you out there.

395
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:55,000
Speaker 0: Look, I honestly answer this question for me.

396
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,487
Speaker 0: I'm really really curious.

397
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,778
Speaker 0: I'll put up a poll or something on the forum about this.

398
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:01,910
Speaker 0: if World of Warcraft were changed.

399
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:08,460
Speaker 0: It was the exact same game Except that every single player could arbitrarily choose their level and equipment at any time.

400
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,259
Speaker 0: Well at any time outside of a raid once you start a raid you stuck with what you got.

401
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:16,320
Speaker 0: But you could just arbitrarily choose level and arbitrarily choose equipment.

402
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:20,780
Speaker 0: Would you continue to play World of Warcraft and do you think you would make it a better or worse game?

403
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,500
Speaker 0: I imagine that question will tell me a lot about who what kind of person you are.

404
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:34,400
Speaker 1: I imagine that most people would do that go around and sort of see everything there was in the game and then stop playing.

405
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:38,140
Speaker 0: But yes, you know what because then the game would be almost exactly like Crystal Chronicles.

406
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:45,480
Speaker 1: Yes Well, the other thing right is that I've noticed there are some people in the world right like look at counter-strike, right?

407
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:54,524
Speaker 1: There are some people who play counter-strike and they don't cheat and they actually want like a good game right and like like if I cheated a counter-strike like I mean Oh, I had.

408
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:59,795
Speaker 1: I was I had a computer once that you know It was at like a LAN party or whatever and it was all full of counter-strike cheats.

409
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:07,919
Speaker 1: and you know You played a few times with all the cheats and you just shoot everyone in the head and you win and you win and you Win and whatever and it got boring really quick.

410
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:27,180
Speaker 1: But there are other people where with the cheats like they're having fun forever with those cheats like it's never unfun for them, right and I imagine the kind of person who Enjoys, you know the cheating game continuously You know is the one kind of person and the person who can't deal with the cheating game is the other kind of person.

411
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:28,819
Speaker 0: See, I don't know how relevant it is.

412
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Speaker 0: I mean sure there would be some people but I guess the other extension you could have is every raid would have a level cap.

413
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:35,696
Speaker 0: so it's not so.

414
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:43,640
Speaker 0: then the Pre-game meta grind crap no longer exists because no longer do you have to do repetitive tasks?

415
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,940
Speaker 1: But how is that any different from the World of Warcraft card game, which we were bashing because that's not a multiplayer game?

416
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,542
Speaker 0: That's not.

417
00:28:49,622 --> 00:28:51,128
Speaker 1: it is when you do those raid thingies.

418
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,400
Speaker 1: It's a bunch of people together versus the one guy who has the raid deck.

419
00:28:55,062 --> 00:29:02,837
Speaker 0: Well, if you do that specific aspect of the game, which we didn't play and can't talk a lot about Yeah, but we pretty much confirm that the way the game works is a matter of you.

420
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:04,460
Speaker 1: once you know What's in the raid deck?

421
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:12,072
Speaker 1: It's just a matter of Constructing your deck to beat it as in a rock-paper-scissors where you know The other guy has rock and you win.

422
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:13,540
Speaker 0: that could probably be really fun.

423
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:16,380
Speaker 1: So if I know the raid is full of fire, I choose all the water.

424
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:26,194
Speaker 0: It would be just as fun as playing the hero quest like games or beat the game games for alright Here's the game you play request is terrible.

425
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,400
Speaker 0: Well, actually it's kind of funny.

426
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,593
Speaker 0: You just got to add a lot of style to it and just get into it.

427
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:30,820
Speaker 1: No, it's terrible.

428
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:31,367
Speaker 1: What's they are?

429
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:32,440
Speaker 1: you want to play hero quest now?

430
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,977
Speaker 0: The only problem was when we decided to iterate through it perfectly.

431
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:37,519
Speaker 0: and I'm not.

432
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:41,660
Speaker 0: I mean Wow is a lot better than hero quest in that regard even the card games a lot better than hero.

433
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,033
Speaker 1: Well, because only because it's more complex so it but it fundamentally is no different.

434
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:48,159
Speaker 0: but you're I just don't get your.

435
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:56,383
Speaker 0: oh well fundamentally because all games fundamentally are either completely arbitrary or completely stalemate or Completely solved.

436
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:57,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, why?

437
00:29:57,628 --> 00:30:00,780
Speaker 0: if you argue with that level then there's no point in even talking about games anymore?

438
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are because there are games that are not solved.

439
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:05,814
Speaker 0: So then play those games.

440
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:10,019
Speaker 0: I do not really you don't play go You don't really play chess because goes not fun.

441
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:12,564
Speaker 0: No, it isn't.

442
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:13,146
Speaker 1: it's mostly.

443
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,530
Speaker 1: so no it isn't solved enough.

444
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,253
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

445
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:16,637
Speaker 1: There are only so many possible.

446
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:17,420
Speaker 1: board configuration.

447
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,307
Speaker 0: Yes, and we have not explored it fully.

448
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,953
Speaker 0: chess is nowhere near solved.

449
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,539
Speaker 1: No, they're computers that beat everyone.

450
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:22,820
Speaker 1: That's good.

451
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:33,568
Speaker 0: No, hey, whatever things of the day.

452
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:38,730
Speaker 0: So you go in a nother out along with Conrad and we went to the mocha and all that stuff this weekend.

453
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:47,559
Speaker 0: But one thing that you go showed us in the litany of because it's kind of a I don't know front row crew Instead of like shaking hands when we all get together.

454
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,850
Speaker 0: We all show each other all the internet things we've seen recently.

455
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:59,205
Speaker 1: Yeah and some people have all seen the same sort of stuff because they don't go to good sites and other people have seen all sorts of Things because they're internet addicts with nothing to do at work,

456
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:07,044
Speaker 0: but at the same time Some of us like just we're in different circles on the internet, but this is a game.

457
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:14,149
Speaker 0: it's on pixel jam called Dino run and the premise is pretty simple exchange studios and all that.

458
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:20,950
Speaker 0: Basically, you take a little yellow dinosaur and you run away from the apocalypse.

459
00:31:22,153 --> 00:31:24,210
Speaker 0: Now I'm not gonna go into any depth about this game.

460
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,770
Speaker 0: You should probably just play it and you'll figure out what's going on pretty quick.

461
00:31:27,192 --> 00:31:30,166
Speaker 0: All I really want to say is that doom surfing is really fun.

462
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:33,950
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah The the way the game handles it's a lot.

463
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:38,883
Speaker 0: It's very pixely really good control and it reminds me a lot of passage just in the.

464
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:41,310
Speaker 0: it's very artistic and wallets pixely.

465
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,815
Speaker 0: It's very stylistically awesome.

466
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:46,366
Speaker 1: The gameplay reminds me of this one level from kid chameleon.

467
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:54,979
Speaker 1: if you haven't played kid chameleon It's one of the great old Genesis platform games that has been forgotten and if you should really go get it Maybe that should be on the virtual console.

468
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:55,984
Speaker 1: I wonder if it is or isn't.

469
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:08,150
Speaker 0: I Don't know but the effect of the apocalypse when it's coming up behind you is actually really scary and as you get into the higher Levels this game is so unnerving and like all your muscles just tense up and was like

470
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:13,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though it's primarily a game of holding right but those stegosaur

471
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:16,332
Speaker 0: I oh man and it gets a lot harder as time goes On.

472
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:16,896
Speaker 0: don't worry.

473
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:24,930
Speaker 1: The other thing is the game has some interesting stuff you can do that you might not realize like there'll be a Pterodactyl and like if you you know, I think they come at you.

474
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,853
Speaker 1: That's this bad like if I can joust but at the same time sometimes they'll pick you up and carry you farther ahead to help You out.

475
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:32,489
Speaker 1: It's it's pretty, you know, if you do the right thing.

476
00:32:33,232 --> 00:32:36,340
Speaker 0: Also your little avatar the dinosaur is super cute.

477
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:37,062
Speaker 1: He's alright.

478
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,465
Speaker 0: He is super cute.

479
00:32:38,486 --> 00:32:39,288
Speaker 0: You don't understand.

480
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:40,130
Speaker 1: He's not that cute.

481
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:40,893
Speaker 0: Yes, he is.

482
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,985
Speaker 0: Anyway, he waves at you and he wears a crown once you've won.

483
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:50,450
Speaker 1: really I gotta get the crown Alright, so when we were at the mocha, right there was some other stuff going down in the city.

484
00:32:50,551 --> 00:33:09,050
Speaker 1: I don't know if you remember this but way back in the day I don't know how way back in the day But these people played this game of pack Manhattan where they combine sort of GPS computer portable technology But also the real world and the street and human beings to sort of make a game, right?

485
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:16,350
Speaker 1: So people would actually walk around the street to control the Pac-mans and the ghosts you see and that resulted in a pretty fun game.

486
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:18,909
Speaker 1: So they had this event this weekend.

487
00:33:19,552 --> 00:33:21,739
Speaker 1: This is the problem of doing shows unfrequently.

488
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,368
Speaker 1: is that I talked about things after they happened.

489
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:24,950
Speaker 1: Isn't that said?

490
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,070
Speaker 1: Called come out and play festival 2008.

491
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,231
Speaker 1: It was.

492
00:33:28,411 --> 00:33:48,425
Speaker 1: it was this past weekend June 6th through 8th, and they had a whole bunch of games sort of like this And they are all sort of pretty cool and you can read about them and see pictures on their flicker group and all that good stuff of all the cool sort of outdoors Synergistic cool games these people were playing and I like this kind of action.

493
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:51,319
Speaker 1: if it wasn't mocha this weekend I probably would have been doing this.

494
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,170
Speaker 1: In fact, it was sort of a crazy weekend.

495
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,079
Speaker 1: It was like all these events in the city happening simultaneously.

496
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,849
Speaker 1: There was like a. there was also a Kaiju Big Patel on Saturday I believe.

497
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:14,130
Speaker 1: Alright, so way back in the day on the NES if you were a cool kid you had River City Ransom And if you had River City Ransom you probably also had Super Dodgeball and possibly World Cup possibly World Cup.

498
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:27,130
Speaker 1: But you noticed even if you were a dumb kid that these games looked familiar and similar For some reason maybe perhaps because they're both made by the same company or part of the same series of games.

499
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,601
Speaker 0: Now we're not going to get into the whole history of the Kunio Kun franchise.

500
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:32,603
Speaker 1: No, we are not.

501
00:34:32,764 --> 00:34:42,770
Speaker 1: we're going to talk just about mostly Dodgeball because there is a brand new game that just came out for the DS Super dodgeball brawlers and we both got it.

502
00:34:43,091 --> 00:35:00,089
Speaker 0: Now this game is based pretty much straight up on Super Dodgeball for the NES Which well, that's how you all would have known it and when I was a kid This is probably one of my favorite games ever I got to the point where I could beat the entire game on hard without ever once being hit by any ball at any point.

503
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:04,110
Speaker 1: I didn't get that good, but I could definitely beat the game on hard.

504
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,770
Speaker 0: The best part was when you beat the game on hard on any of the settings especially hard without losing anybody.

505
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:23,335
Speaker 0: Then after you beat the Soviet Russians, then you find the evil team the shadow team Which is your team only evil and black and white with lightning in the background and pretty much some of the best music in any NES game ever.

506
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:24,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was good.

507
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,890
Speaker 1: I wonder if you can do a similar thing in the DS one.

508
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:26,896
Speaker 1: I haven't made it happen yet.

509
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,290
Speaker 0: I haven't really tried because the single-player is kind of crap.

510
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:31,242
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah single-player is pretty crap.

511
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:35,418
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Super dodgeball check this the way this thing works.

512
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:36,281
Speaker 1: It doesn't work.

513
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:39,610
Speaker 1: like the dodgeball you play in gym class, right?

514
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,835
Speaker 1: Which actually I like the gym.

515
00:35:41,136 --> 00:35:45,961
Speaker 1: gym dodgeball you play in gym class better as a game But it doesn't work as a video game.

516
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:47,190
Speaker 1: This works as a video game.

517
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,629
Speaker 1: The way it is is there's a field with two squares that are even in size and each square has four guys.

518
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:57,910
Speaker 0: I'm curious if anyone out there is so far removed from gaming that you've never played Super Dodgeball.

519
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,310
Speaker 1: I'm just describing it real quick.

520
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:00,514
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah I'm just curious.

521
00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:01,539
Speaker 1: and the four guys?

522
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,930
Speaker 1: if they all get hit with the ball and so Enough that their life is completely lost?

523
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:10,563
Speaker 0: Hey guys All right There was only four and I call the new game has four and the the.

524
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:13,557
Speaker 0: I guess the original arcade game had four But the original arcade game is weird.

525
00:36:13,577 --> 00:36:14,361
Speaker 0: We're not gonna talk about.

526
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,009
Speaker 1: the original NES only had three, huh?

527
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't remember that.

528
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:17,960
Speaker 1: I see.

529
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,510
Speaker 1: No anyway, the new DS one is four.

530
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:28,674
Speaker 1: There's three or four guys in the box and if you you try to hit the other teams three or four guys in the box with the ball and Then they die.

531
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:34,329
Speaker 1: eventually if you hit them enough with powerful enough moves And then if you eliminate all their guys in the box you win.

532
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:38,509
Speaker 1: You also have three guys on the other sides of the box.

533
00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:41,218
Speaker 1: So Basically, the two boxes are connected.

534
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:44,050
Speaker 1: So it's your three or four guys versus their three or four guys.

535
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:59,303
Speaker 1: but then you also have one guy above the other team one guy below the other team one guy behind the other team to sort of help you out and they have one guy behind you one guy above you one guy below you and You just throw the ball back and forth try and hit the other guy and this super moves.

536
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,035
Speaker 1: and you can do jumping super moves And you can do regular throws.

537
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:14,650
Speaker 1: you can do tricky stuff like by passing the ball like jump up like you're gonna do super move But then pass the ball back to your team and then they throw a super move or throw the ball over their heads Then throw it back over their heads and then throw it at them.

538
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:16,361
Speaker 0: But regardless of all that what made?

539
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:17,770
Speaker 0: at least we'll talk about the original first.

540
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,349
Speaker 0: What made the original game great?

541
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:20,895
Speaker 0: Was that it was a?

542
00:37:20,915 --> 00:37:26,572
Speaker 0: I mean had a single-player and it added like actually had a couple of different like single-player multiplayer modes But nothing really.

543
00:37:27,154 --> 00:37:34,489
Speaker 0: the only thing that was really good about the game was playing versus with another person Absolutely direct straight up.

544
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:40,466
Speaker 0: I am playing against my little brother and one of us is going to win and the game was so.

545
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:44,237
Speaker 1: it was all about Skills of button pressing timing.

546
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:48,430
Speaker 1: I mean you would throw the super move and everyone can see the super move coming from a mile away.

547
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:56,968
Speaker 0: But it's could you push the button with the correct timing to catch the ball and the one great thing is unlike the situation We're in now like Scott is with dr.

548
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:15,063
Speaker 0: Mario or I'm with advanced wars or the way I am with gemfire and all those stupid games that no one in the world likes but me Everyone I knew was just as into super dodgeball as I was so like all of my little friends We'd all get together and play dodgeball all the time yeah, and always be like the because you pick teams at the same time.

549
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:18,227
Speaker 0: the teams are not even at all and It always be the same.

550
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:28,477
Speaker 0: like I would very purposefully pick very quickly and pick the weakest ass team which by the way was England Yeah, and then the other players.

551
00:38:28,497 --> 00:38:29,199
Speaker 0: than a conundrum.

552
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:38,569
Speaker 0: Do they similarly defect and take another crappy team like India or Do they decide to just be a loser and pick Russia and try to beat me?

553
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:51,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, because if they pick Russia and they win whatever it's a lot like playing Mario Kart with the wee wheel instead of using the Nunchuck wiimote combination because if you lose with the wee wheel Well, of course you lost you using the wee wheel.

554
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:55,209
Speaker 1: if you lose with England against Russia, of course you lost.

555
00:38:55,229 --> 00:39:02,383
Speaker 1: you were England They were Russia, but if you win with England against Russia, whoa That's like using the wiimote to beat someone with the better controls.

556
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:03,428
Speaker 1: I mean the the we wheel.

557
00:39:03,629 --> 00:39:06,477
Speaker 0: anyway The game was super awesome.

558
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:16,970
Speaker 0: I remember like and everyone had different super moves, but the game was kind of Undocumented back then and like no one seemed to really remember that you had your air move and your ground move.

559
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:21,330
Speaker 0: But at the Steve on everyone's team because all the teams were kind of the same had three moves.

560
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,890
Speaker 0: He had two ground moves and one air move.

561
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:27,870
Speaker 1: Yep The other thing about the game is that no matter how good anyone got no one ever got to be perfect.

562
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,101
Speaker 1: Like when we were in the duck hunt tournament, we were perfect, but it's super duh.

563
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:32,406
Speaker 0: I don't know.

564
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:40,886
Speaker 1: in multiplayer You'll always Eventually, even if two people are great throw the super move catch it.

565
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:43,161
Speaker 1: throw the super move catch Well, they would try to fool them.

566
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:46,355
Speaker 1: super move catch Well, no if you're someone will eventually not catch it.

567
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:49,644
Speaker 0: really good like actually truly perfect or really good.

568
00:39:49,664 --> 00:39:50,486
Speaker 0: players were playing.

569
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:57,930
Speaker 0: it came down to who Became fatigued the quickest and games would last an hour or more until eventually someone was so tired.

570
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,695
Speaker 0: But that's what dodgeball is.

571
00:39:59,715 --> 00:40:02,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just like a real dodgeball when I was a kid.

572
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:03,447
Speaker 0: I'll tell you this though.

573
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:12,250
Speaker 0: I Thought that Dodge like I always because I had this game one what we would play dodgeball in the yard with all our friends.

574
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:14,450
Speaker 0: We would play it like super dodgeball.

575
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:20,388
Speaker 0: We like I'd run up to the center and jump and throw and that was not a good idea.

576
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:21,170
Speaker 0: Totally awesome.

577
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:33,275
Speaker 0: but beyond that I Always thoughts for the longest time when I was a little kid because of this game That when you were in gym class in school in elementary school playing dodgeball That wasn't a real dodgeball.

578
00:40:33,616 --> 00:40:39,894
Speaker 0: that was wuss dodgeball for little kids and somehow I thought that there was an Olympic sport And I used to.

579
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:55,452
Speaker 0: as far as I was concerned the rules were When someone can't get up anymore and the entire team is knocked unconscious Then your side won and I thought that this was based on that and I thought that they played with a volleyball or maybe a medicine Ball,

580
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:58,484
Speaker 1: maybe that's the ticket to get all the nerds to play.

581
00:40:58,504 --> 00:40:59,870
Speaker 1: We should play some dodge balls.

582
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:04,179
Speaker 0: Well, I ordered a regulation kickball.

583
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,243
Speaker 1: see what that's not see.

584
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,306
Speaker 1: that's enough for one ball.

585
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:07,270
Speaker 1: see the kind of dodgeball.

586
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,280
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe we should just talk about the dodgeballs.

587
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,104
Speaker 1: We played as kids.

588
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:12,357
Speaker 1: That's a separate show I know but I got it.

589
00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:14,410
Speaker 1: I got like a lot of dodgeball things to talk about.

590
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:18,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, we always like we'd play in the gym where if you could make a basket then you let's make a dodgeball week.

591
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,846
Speaker 1: We're doing a Thursday this week.

592
00:41:19,907 --> 00:41:26,952
Speaker 0: Thursday We'll talk about Dodge ball in gym class not Barack Obama and the fact that American politics is finally going in the right direction for the first time In a long time.

593
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:28,479
Speaker 0: No, I'm so excited.

594
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,804
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm so.

595
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:31,090
Speaker 1: people want to hear about the video games.

596
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:32,566
Speaker 0: Just can't hide it.

597
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:39,510
Speaker 1: So The dodgeball for the DS is largely the same as the original dodgeball.

598
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,640
Speaker 1: However, there are many improvements and changes.

599
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:44,826
Speaker 0: one the super moves.

600
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:45,970
Speaker 0: are there a lot more of them?

601
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,889
Speaker 0: And if you're good, you can't just catch all of them.

602
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:56,970
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean the one that have rim hates the most is the one where you run up you throw it and it looks like I Faked it and I passed the ball just to the other teammate on the other side.

603
00:41:57,371 --> 00:42:02,170
Speaker 1: But it makes the super move noise and that's the hint you need to know to turn around.

604
00:42:02,512 --> 00:42:09,390
Speaker 1: Cuz it looks like a normal pass that's going slow But then it turns around it goes whoosh and hits you in the ass and does a lot of damage.

605
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:10,397
Speaker 1: I love that one the best.

606
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:12,109
Speaker 1: you got a favorite super move in there.

607
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:12,995
Speaker 0: I don't know.

608
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:17,036
Speaker 0: my favorite super move was still and they have it in this game But it's not quite the same cuz I used to.

609
00:42:17,437 --> 00:42:22,659
Speaker 0: I played this game so much the original that I had like Personalities for all the people on all the teams.

610
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:26,196
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, definitely and all the moves meant stuff to me And to me.

611
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:31,630
Speaker 0: the nuts shot, you know Like that downward angle disc that the good guy has like the main character good guy.

612
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:34,378
Speaker 0: That was like the good guy move.

613
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,985
Speaker 0: Like that was the noble awesome move of good guy.

614
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:38,630
Speaker 1: That is the noble move indeed.

615
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:41,367
Speaker 1: However, it is also the easily caught move.

616
00:42:42,512 --> 00:42:47,932
Speaker 0: That's another thing is that the move felt like that game did more damage against the evil team at the end even though I know It totally did.

617
00:42:47,972 --> 00:42:53,310
Speaker 1: it is another thing right is that the super moves in the game sort of have this nice balance to them.

618
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,398
Speaker 1: For example, there's one move where all it is.

619
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,550
Speaker 1: It's a straight throw and but it's really fast.

620
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:03,610
Speaker 1: It's easy to catch actually, but if it hits guys it goes straight through them.

621
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:08,330
Speaker 1: So if the other team is all in a clump, you can hit like everyone on the other team with one throw.

622
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,930
Speaker 1: However, that one's really really easy to catch but it also doesn't do a lot of damage.

623
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:20,370
Speaker 0: However, if you use that with the neck ketsu ultimate shot Yeah, I wiped out an entire team in one shower exactly.

624
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,360
Speaker 1: That is the one thing that has been added to this new DS version.

625
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,290
Speaker 0: bunch can be turned off which I love.

626
00:43:26,832 --> 00:43:28,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, everything can be turned off in this which is cool.

627
00:43:29,263 --> 00:43:30,790
Speaker 1: Is this ultimate shot business?

628
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:36,728
Speaker 1: We have this meter and it builds up and catching balls and pass and doing certain certain things builds up your meter.

629
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:42,450
Speaker 0: also Dicking around and not refusing to throw and like just not throwing the ball makes it go down eventually.

630
00:43:42,632 --> 00:43:43,602
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is great.

631
00:43:43,764 --> 00:43:44,290
Speaker 1: It is great.

632
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:48,005
Speaker 0: Hurry up and throw one time to try to win a game against my brother.

633
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,090
Speaker 0: They've been going on for a while.

634
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:57,544
Speaker 0: I refuse to play anymore and I just stood there with the ball and I basically told him either you're going to give up or I'm going to sit here until we starve to death.

635
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:09,838
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway, so You get this meter that fills up and when it fills up you get this super super super move and you can choose actually Prior to the match which super move you would like.

636
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:15,509
Speaker 1: one of the moves is like super defense and catching for like a minute or so Stupid except the ultimate shot.

637
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:21,810
Speaker 1: The ultimate shot is pretty much you get one shot to throw the ball and if it actually hits someone they die no matter what.

638
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:24,058
Speaker 1: And that is the move that everyone picks.

639
00:44:24,118 --> 00:44:25,283
Speaker 1: because how could you God?

640
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:27,170
Speaker 1: How could you not pick?

641
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,149
Speaker 1: Guaranteed kill if you hit someone with the next throw?

642
00:44:30,475 --> 00:44:37,327
Speaker 0: I mean, come on My favorite thing to do and in the original game at least was to run backwards with the accelerator ball.

643
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:41,489
Speaker 0: that I never really saw Until the Russians used it against me in the end of the game.

644
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:46,010
Speaker 0: But you run backwards and throw from the other side and it would get away fast.

645
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it's an accelerator.

646
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:48,542
Speaker 1: It starts out slow.

647
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:52,018
Speaker 0: It didn't actually do any more damage I don't think but it felt real good.

648
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:54,770
Speaker 1: and it also is a lot harder to catch when it was going fast.

649
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:58,607
Speaker 1: So they would start like way in the back goes slow slow slow speed.

650
00:44:58,647 --> 00:44:59,210
Speaker 1: Oh, see don't see it up.

651
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:06,047
Speaker 1: Oh my god is too fast to catch it and it's a lot harder to catch that than the balls of the constant speed You know or the wobbly balls or anything like that.

652
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,517
Speaker 1: All right, so what else they add in this?

653
00:45:08,557 --> 00:45:12,330
Speaker 0: Diaz for hunching kicking and sticks and shit you can throw at each other?

654
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,117
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that stuff is kind of good right.

655
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:16,486
Speaker 1: the punching and kicking though is a little.

656
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:16,768
Speaker 1: it's.

657
00:45:16,868 --> 00:45:18,818
Speaker 1: it's a little bit Okay, and a little bit not okay.

658
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:19,200
Speaker 0: I think it.

659
00:45:19,764 --> 00:45:25,008
Speaker 0: the thing is you can turn it off so I can't complain about it at all, but it adds this extra element to the game.

660
00:45:25,048 --> 00:45:28,673
Speaker 0: because Thing is the single-player game is Just don't buy.

661
00:45:28,713 --> 00:45:36,028
Speaker 0: it's not worth it except to be good at the game and when there's no one to play with The only reason to ever play this game is multiplayer against other people.

662
00:45:36,149 --> 00:45:39,690
Speaker 0: Yep The only reason to play the single-player is to get good at multiplayer with other people.

663
00:45:39,851 --> 00:45:43,270
Speaker 0: Yep, don't even bother with the leveling up getting items.

664
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:44,010
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing.

665
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,014
Speaker 1: Here's the thing that I liked.

666
00:45:45,054 --> 00:45:49,631
Speaker 1: if you play the one player game does leveling up an item is another bullet straight up like River City Ransom.

667
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:50,354
Speaker 0: off is awesome.

668
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:51,638
Speaker 0: buy nice items and such.

669
00:45:51,778 --> 00:45:55,170
Speaker 1: right but it's unnecessary because when it comes time to do multiplayer, right?

670
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:59,583
Speaker 1: Let's say I play through the single-player with not ketsu high school, right?

671
00:45:59,743 --> 00:46:01,428
Speaker 1: Okay, I level them up big time.

672
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:08,262
Speaker 1: now I want to play multiplayer on the team select screen Niketsu high school actually appear twice.

673
00:46:08,543 --> 00:46:10,210
Speaker 1: there'll be white and red versions.

674
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:15,270
Speaker 1: The red version is the leveled up version and the white version is the flat even version.

675
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:23,618
Speaker 1: So you can play with your leveled up stuff if you want to do that sort of game or you can play straight up a fair Game, which is what of course real men do.

676
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,310
Speaker 0: it's kind of like initial D. You turn off the boost exactly exactly.

677
00:46:29,492 --> 00:46:29,592
Speaker 1: Now.

678
00:46:29,632 --> 00:46:35,657
Speaker 1: the one thing we neglected to mention about both up by dodgeball game so far is the brawl Schoolyard mode.

679
00:46:35,797 --> 00:46:36,340
Speaker 1: you see me.

680
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:49,590
Speaker 1: Yes in the original dodgeball There was a schoolyard mode where basically instead of having this sort of structured team game It was an every man for himself game and you the body would just be an open schoolyard.

681
00:46:49,831 --> 00:46:55,647
Speaker 1: Everyone can run wherever they want and throw the ball at whoever they want and the last man alive is the winner.

682
00:46:56,168 --> 00:47:09,959
Speaker 1: and this mode comes back in the new dodgeball with a fierce fierce intensity because For the first time it's eight player wireless multiplayer eight people running around the schoolyard Independently of each other trying to kill each other.

683
00:47:09,979 --> 00:47:12,590
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand how awesome that is.

684
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,463
Speaker 1: The hardest part is getting eight people.

685
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:21,770
Speaker 0: planet gaga God you should see this shit deep and other people ain't talking about disease.

686
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:22,673
Speaker 0: We don't need.

687
00:47:22,713 --> 00:47:29,735
Speaker 1: we do need it cuz it's so awesome to run around eight separate people throwing shit at each other Kicking and plus the kicking and punching in that.

688
00:47:30,096 --> 00:47:30,738
Speaker 1: Oh, come on.

689
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:31,841
Speaker 1: It's good stuff.

690
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:32,101
Speaker 0: Yeah.

691
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:32,442
Speaker 0: Yeah.

692
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:35,770
Speaker 0: Yeah plus just playing multiplayer against other people.

693
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:42,977
Speaker 0: Cuz one thing that's really good is you can customize your team in this perfectly fair Baseball simulator 1000 style of.

694
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:48,328
Speaker 0: pick the special moves pick the names pick the way they look and let me tell you you think you're gonna Pick the way they look.

695
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:59,093
Speaker 1: There are so many faces and hairstyles like you choose the hair the eyes the head the skin color All kinds of stuff.

696
00:47:59,174 --> 00:48:00,998
Speaker 1: There's so many options.

697
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,462
Speaker 0: It's so fantastic.

698
00:48:03,385 --> 00:48:04,066
Speaker 0: I got a minute.

699
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:04,868
Speaker 1: I'm very.

700
00:48:04,888 --> 00:48:06,454

719
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:56,887
Speaker 0: no no Paul's voice.

720
00:48:57,509 --> 00:48:58,392

722
00:49:11,245 --> 00:49:17,810
Speaker 1: You He's got a Lucha Libre mask that makes it look like you were gonna say Chupacabra.

723
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,498
Speaker 1: No, I knew it was it's Lucha.

724
00:49:19,518 --> 00:49:21,226
Speaker 0: Not anyway, why'd you said Chupa?

725
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,850
Speaker 1: I was close.

726
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:25,641
Speaker 1: Anyway, you know I made them all look like the bosses right.

727
00:49:25,681 --> 00:49:37,250
Speaker 1: then the three guys I have on the defense side are Keys like like and And Stop flows and the one guy looks like a skeleton.

728
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:47,003
Speaker 1: The other guy has like bat blue bat hair that looks like a bat and the like-like is just sort of blobby And it totally made them look like the Zelda guys thing is.

729
00:49:47,103 --> 00:49:51,301
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna make my final team I'm gonna go with and I think it's gonna be chromare high school.

730
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:59,850
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a good one, but Because there are plenty of pompadours in this game for your selection so many different styles of pompadour.

731
00:50:00,274 --> 00:50:06,324
Speaker 1: I mean if you're a pompadour Enthusiast buy this game for no other reason than the hairstyles.

732
00:50:06,665 --> 00:50:07,147
Speaker 0: pretty much.

733
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:09,901
Speaker 0: if I'm gonna we're gonna You know endorse this game or whatever.

734
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:22,370
Speaker 0: the single-player is Really fun if you're still in the stage of your life where River City Ransom is fun for a non-nostalgic way in that You are willing to level up and bullshit buy stuff and you like that sort of thing.

735
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:23,876
Speaker 1: You don't even need to do the leveling up.

736
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:29,910
Speaker 0: you can ignore it because you like the single-player without that I'm saying is if you like that stuff the game will cater to you.

737
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:40,170
Speaker 0: But where I think the only reason to truly buy this game as opposed to borrowing it from someone is if you plan To play seriously against other people all the time.

738
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:40,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, we bought.

739
00:50:40,834 --> 00:50:43,230
Speaker 1: I bought this game for full price on Amazon.

740
00:50:43,411 --> 00:50:54,430
Speaker 1: You know when it was announced and I pre-ordered it and everything and that you know That was okay for us because we have to review it and we're big dodgeball fans or whatever and we have plenty of money If you even if you want to play this game.

741
00:50:54,611 --> 00:50:57,610
Speaker 1: The game is good for the DS the super dodgeball brawlers.

742
00:50:57,751 --> 00:51:01,129
Speaker 1: But I really suggest you wait until it's a little discounted before you.

743
00:51:01,129 --> 00:51:06,687
Speaker 0: $20 for it not 30 if you want to be the very best.

744
00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:09,469
Speaker 1: Yes I don't think you need to really be the very best of this.

745
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:10,393
Speaker 1: It's sort of.

746
00:51:10,714 --> 00:51:14,305
Speaker 0: I've been playing on hard now with the team that has all one stats just to practice.

747
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:15,630
Speaker 1: Oh, that's pretty good.

748
00:51:16,612 --> 00:51:21,297
Speaker 1: I put all my guys at like even stats just to you know Cuz I'm not sure which stats mean.

749
00:51:21,338 --> 00:51:22,302
Speaker 0: that's matter a lot.

750
00:51:22,342 --> 00:51:23,085
Speaker 0: just on a lark.

751
00:51:23,326 --> 00:51:29,125
Speaker 0: I made one guy I put like ball speed up to 32 and the ball was like wickedly fast.

752
00:51:29,325 --> 00:51:29,626
Speaker 1: Yeah.

753
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:30,890
Speaker 1: See that's what I'm trying to figure out.

754
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:35,430
Speaker 1: It's like okay if I put the ball speed up to 32, I'm gonna have to have like no dodging ability.

755
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,155
Speaker 1: It's like alright.

756
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:38,389
Speaker 1: Well that me, you know, is it worth it?

00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,072
Speaker 1: You know, will I?

758
00:51:39,273 --> 00:51:42,086
Speaker 1: will I win more often if I have an incredibly fast ball?

759
00:51:42,106 --> 00:51:45,147
Speaker 1: That's hard to dodge You know, I got to figure that stuff out anyway.

760
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,620
Speaker 1: Super dodgeball brawlers original super dodgeball.

761
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,210
Speaker 1: Yeah people go out and get the ROM of the original super isn't it?

762
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:51,939
Speaker 1: Maybe it's on the we.

763
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:58,930
Speaker 0: we were Console if I if it is and I didn't buy it I consider that a failing in my life.

764
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,979
Speaker 0: This game is so like to me and my little brother.

765

Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah super dodgeball either.

769
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:13,830
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's on virtual console, but on ROMs at least or super dodgeball brawlers.

770
00:52:14,372 --> 00:52:22,565
Speaker 1: you should at least play some of these and figure out what the deal is with this because this is sort of a Semi big deal for cool video game peoples.

771
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:28,870
Speaker 0: and on that note We're probably gonna stop because this crazy thunderstorm is rolling through and I got and I'm not.

772
00:52:29,594 --> 00:52:38,050
Speaker 0: I haven't hooked the moran's back up since mocha So it's if the power went out I would pretty much have like 30 seconds to get the show saved before the UPS died.
