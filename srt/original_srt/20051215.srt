Speaker 1: That's for sure I'm gonna do on Sunday.

00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:48,768
Speaker 2: There's like a of course.

15
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,200
Speaker 2: It's not rush hour, but they were talking about a four passenger car rule.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,116
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you know what I'll drive you and two mannequins.

17
00:00:55,257 --> 00:01:01,020
Speaker 2: so anyway I'm just here for the weekend to escape the you know seductive procrastination powers of Manhattan.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,328
Speaker 2: well I finished my term paper.

19
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:04,120
Speaker 2: You know I figure being out here in the boonies.

20
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:15,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz there's no seductive procrastination powers in here with all our technologies and Like I know what I know it's weird.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,409
Speaker 2: But like I'm very personal about computers like when using another person's computer is like I don't know like using.

22
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:35,293
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of a good personal analogy, but it's like I Sing and like just wasting time and somebody else's computer like.

23
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,886
Speaker 2: I feel like if I'm using a borrowed computer I should be like actually doing work.

24
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:41,294
Speaker 0: I have the like the dual nature on one hand.

25
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:44,989
Speaker 0: I'm an IT professional and I'm very good at like.

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:58,737
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people's passwords But like it's I'm not conscious of it, and I see like horrible things that people have hidden on their hard drives But I just don't even think about it, but at the same time I'm very good at computer forensics, and I want to just dig through and see what dirt I can find.

27
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,680
Speaker 1: yeah See it used to be we're using another person's computer was like this alien painful experience.

28
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:16,220
Speaker 1: But now most of the computers that I use all have Firefox and as long as they have Firefox I can access all my web stuff And I have enough stuff that's web only and web-based that it doesn't matter if I don't have my desktop stuff.

29
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,188
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess it doesn't bother me that much.

30
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:24,020
Speaker 2: It's more like it's not like oh, I'm worried I'm gonna find something weird on computer or anything like that.

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,771
Speaker 2: It's more like you know stuff's not organized the way.

32
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:33,136
Speaker 2: I'm used to it being organized and you know Resist the urge to change things you know yeah, yeah, I don't want to.

33
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:33,538
Speaker 2: you know.

34
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:36,931
Speaker 2: last time I was here as changed rims desktop, and he still got it changed.

35
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,120
Speaker 0: well because your change was better than my desktop.

36
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:44,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the thing is sometimes like I'm trying to make a change like I know this will make their computer faster.

37
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:48,000
Speaker 1: But sometimes it's like I know that this way is more efficient.

38
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,910
Speaker 1: But are they used to the other way and will they bitch?

39
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:54,700
Speaker 0: well remember that time we were at Luke's house And we turned on his computer, and he didn't have a video car driver.

40
00:02:56,484 --> 00:03:01,677
Speaker 0: We installed video car drivers and all this stuff, and he was mad when he came home until he realized that it was better.

41
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:03,725
Speaker 2: Yeah You just don't know.

42
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:07,989
Speaker 2: See those are the best good deeds.

43
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:08,994
Speaker 2: You know don't you?

44
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:10,360
Speaker 2: don't you feel warm inside?

45
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,102
Speaker 2: Helping people.

46
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:17,040
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah like like when you helped Alice with her computer, and she like venerated you all weekend.

47
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:18,555
Speaker 2: That was that was something.

48
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:24,000
Speaker 0: yeah I've learned that removing spyware is very lucrative because even if you don't ask for money people give you money anyway.

49
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:26,984
Speaker 2: Don't you love when?

50
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:28,529
Speaker 2: then the non technology people?

51
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:40,734
Speaker 2: and like to be honest you know I'll be perfectly frank I'm I'm kind of like one of those people kind of like the people who drive a car and they have a vague idea of what's happening under the hood and You know, but they're not being able to.

52
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:45,274
Speaker 2: like my sister You know get out the wrench, and you know take the thing apart, so I'm.

53
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:46,880
Speaker 2: you know I like computers.

54
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:53,305
Speaker 2: You know I'm I'm a film animation person, so you know I'm more of an art girl than a tech girl But I like the tech end of things.

55
00:03:53,647 --> 00:04:01,019
Speaker 0: I just you know not as not as cool as these suckers here Despite my ancient computer that these two were making fun of me for not two minutes ago.

56
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:06,060
Speaker 1: I know a lot of you would consider my computer ancient, and it's really not, but it's just not a media computer.

57
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:09,699
Speaker 2: It's like it's perfectly viable for all the stuff you do.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,405
Speaker 1: Crashes it does.

59
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:21,273
Speaker 0: yeah, the USB crashing, but for all of you who are following along next Monday We're gonna continue the buying a computer saga And the forms have been exploding about that.

60
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:23,284
Speaker 0: so expect some good Stuff.

61
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:26,999
Speaker 2: oh, oh bad thing did I tell you I had like this?

62
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:37,904
Speaker 2: I I love my 3d teacher, but like every time computers comes up He's like a major Windows fanatic, and I don't know how buddy how anybody can be a Windows Like.

63
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:42,757
Speaker 1: some podcast was saying like did you know they're actually Windows fanatics, and I'm like what?

64
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:46,106
Speaker 1: and they were like yeah But they're out there.

65
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:52,996
Speaker 0: yeah, I always figured that people who use Windows and like it It's just because they don't know better, or they don't want to learn or Linux is scary.

66
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:54,020
Speaker 1: I met one guy.

67
00:04:55,221 --> 00:05:02,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew that there was one guy once who I it was a Windows fanatic But he was like Windows XP is the best, and I'm like what do you?

68
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:09,040
Speaker 1: He runs Windows XP Maya and nothing else unlike this dual processor.

69
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:12,874
Speaker 1: See this is he doesn't use the computer for anything.

70
00:05:13,436 --> 00:05:16,387
Speaker 2: with the Maya people I've got like this.

71
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:17,937
Speaker 2: I'm going love affair with Maya.

72
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:27,748
Speaker 1: It's It's my new obsession cuz they're not really computer people is really just a Maya guy And he runs Maya on Windows as opposed to I guess Mac And I just likes it better on Windows.

73
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:28,793
Speaker 1: so he's a Windows fanatic.

74
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:32,966
Speaker 2: apparently Maya does For some reason there's like.

75
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:37,620
Speaker 2: just talk about that as optimized for Windows or it runs better on Windows or something like that.

76
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:41,552
Speaker 2: I've got personal learning edition on my Mac in it.

77
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:47,309
Speaker 2: It's take forever to load like I. Apparently I checked I have sufficient RAM.

78
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:48,513
Speaker 2: I don't know what the problem is.

79
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,420
Speaker 2: It's just like slow as beans.

80
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:52,572
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens with the Intel Mac action.

81
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:57,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, yes One cool guy work is waiting until they come out to buy a new PowerBook.

82
00:05:57,581 --> 00:05:59,963
Speaker 1: I think everyone is yeah Except me who's.

83
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:05,400
Speaker 2: I've got to find a good laptop before I go to Japan and my sister's got some good deals through her.

84
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:09,656
Speaker 1: I heard a rumor that Apple's gonna come out with a laptop that doesn't have a hard drive.

85
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:10,539
Speaker 1: It just has flash.

86
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:14,720
Speaker 1: So if that happens I might get that because damn it'll be small.

87
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know I remember that Steve Jobs personally comes to your house and delivers it every time you buy.

88
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:21,244
Speaker 0: So we'll see where that.

89
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:23,591
Speaker 1: so that's how he sells all those things.

90
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:32,019
Speaker 1: though speaking of laptops remember the MIT $100 laptop that you want to make you mean the useless thing with a crank on it and the tiny tiny screen.

91
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,984
Speaker 0: yeah It sparked a lot of debate, but they picked a Manufacturer.

92
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:38,489
Speaker 1: now someone's actually gonna build them.

93
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,300
Speaker 0: well apparently I mean the slashdot article is very misleading.

94
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,507
Speaker 0: They haven't found someone who said they can build it.

95
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:48,969
Speaker 0: they picked a company and asked this company to come up with a feasible design Didn't they already design?

96
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:50,480
Speaker 1: and now they're just looking for someone to build it.

97
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,464
Speaker 1: I mean what what what?

98
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:53,955
Speaker 0: they've designed it, but they it's not $100 what they want.

99
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,567
Speaker 2: I heard it was you know like.

100
00:06:56,788 --> 00:07:03,335
Speaker 2: you know the the case that they wanted for it was very like Like kind of kid looking.

101
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,160
Speaker 0: and yeah, they wanted.

102
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:08,998
Speaker 1: But that's good because then it'll be you know.

103
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:15,788
Speaker 1: I guess the idea is that you'll give this to like poor people in Africa and such that they can have Some sort of access.

104
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:16,432
Speaker 1: you know like.

105
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:17,620
Speaker 1: I've heard of towns where?

106
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:28,059
Speaker 1: People have wireless laptops and some guy drives through the town on a motorcycle and collects all the emails Wirelessly and then drives to someplace with this internet and dumps all the emails off.

107
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:33,560
Speaker 1: So if people had this kind of thing It would just be so much easier for them to get in on that sort of system.

108
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:43,998
Speaker 0: Well, I like I mean it's a really good idea, but what surprises me is how much absolute Vamint there is in the people who are opposed to the idea of donating these laptops or designing them or anything.

109
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:44,540
Speaker 2: why?

110
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,136
Speaker 0: Because well their argument seems to be this money could be spent better, or why not give them $100 worth of food?

111
00:07:50,176 --> 00:08:00,069
Speaker 0: or Basically their argument seemed to be we should only focus on one problem at a time instead of trying to fix many problems Was some ways.

112
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:06,976
Speaker 2: I I think there are Certain certain areas of the world where it does seem not to be a priority.

113
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:14,700
Speaker 2: as far as you know the things that need fixing Yeah, but I mean if someone's gonna.

114
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:26,666
Speaker 0: I mean my partake is basically if someone's going to go out of their way to do a charitable thing if they donate something You know if somebody's giving something That can help Why not take it?

115
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:31,507
Speaker 0: I mean if more that if I'm doing it of my own prerogative I should be able to do whatever I want.

116
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:36,385
Speaker 0: if I donate a toy to a kid or food or a band-aid or a laptop I donated something.

117
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:40,140
Speaker 0: yep, so you can't tell people what to donate then it's not really a donation.

118
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:44,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one good thing I have to say is like you know if someone's gonna donate.

119
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,497
Speaker 1: I mean saying that like food is the number one problem here that people are starving in Somalia or something right.

120
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:50,500
Speaker 1: so anyone who?

121
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,879
Speaker 1: Donates should donate food.

122
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:53,005
Speaker 1: Well what if I'm?

123
00:08:53,306 --> 00:09:00,840
Speaker 1: you know what if my donation of food isn't so much because I'm not a farmer But I can donate a whole lot of computer stuff and the farmer can donate a whole lot of food.

124
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,691
Speaker 1: You know everyone should donate where they can do the most good in.

125
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,640
Speaker 1: you know their area because I couldn't really donate that much food.

126
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:11,695
Speaker 1: You know I'm not a farmer, but the bad thing is okay.

127
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:12,317
Speaker 1: $100 computer.

128
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:12,940
Speaker 1: It's real cheap.

129
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:19,829
Speaker 1: it could bring the internet to all these people but $100 is still really expensive for a poor starving person.

130
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:28,460
Speaker 0: well the the rationale here is that governments will buy them to distribute or Western societies will take donations and use them to buy them for people.

131
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:34,590
Speaker 1: Oh, oh come on if we're just gonna use them to buy them for people I can buy $100 desktops and just send them there.

132
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:40,805
Speaker 0: The rationale for this is most of these places don't have access to electricity Like our battery.

133
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,571
Speaker 0: a car better.

134
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:43,474
Speaker 0: that doesn't work Scott.

135
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, no yeah, no why not?

136
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:53,420
Speaker 0: There's a lot of But things like capacitors and resistors all right whatever and electrons.

137
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:56,368
Speaker 2: Anyway, the whole concept.

138
00:09:56,408 --> 00:10:08,478
Speaker 2: I guess you know more than the you know charity aspect of it the idea of You know a laptop that wouldn't require any power source or anything with just kind of cool.

139
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:09,020
Speaker 2: Yeah, the crank.

140
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:14,429
Speaker 1: You have noticed a lot of Crank and solar chargers lately.

141
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:20,840
Speaker 1: they got backpacks with solar cells to charge your iPod And they got cranks to charge laptops and digital cameras.

142
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:26,278
Speaker 1: You know while it's probably not good idea to recharge a whole lithium-ion battery like that.

143
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:31,239
Speaker 1: You'll hurt yourself Really good for being in the middle of nowhere camping your cell phone runs out.

144
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:33,020
Speaker 1: You know if you got no power yeah.

145
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:35,310
Speaker 0: Or say you live in a more enlightened area.

146
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:40,637
Speaker 0: what if a place like New York City set up little Chargers in the street that just power themselves solarly?

147
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:55,654
Speaker 2: well You know it's funny because a lot of the you know those little shops that sell like all sorts of I heart, New York goods and like A lot of them sell cell phone charges.

148
00:10:55,714 --> 00:11:00,426
Speaker 2: You know it's like for five minutes You can charge your cell phone at their charger And they charge you like.

149
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,100
Speaker 1: do they have it like an adapter for every cell phone and everything there?

150
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:06,360
Speaker 2: I'm not sure you know cuz I've never done it, but I've seen this advertise.

151
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:08,915
Speaker 2: You know free technology charging.

152
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,609
Speaker 1: I knew they had something like that cuz it works.

153
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:28,033
Speaker 1: one day some guys like you know blackberry died And he for some reason they didn't have a charging cable Or I don't know what was going on But they went down to like the cell phone store like the singular store And they got him a recharge or like a bad or they just traded in his battery for one that was charged that they had Or so I don't know.

154
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:34,435
Speaker 0: well I think there's definitely gonna be more and more of a market for that sort of thing because Battery technology is not keeping up with technology.

155
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:38,008
Speaker 1: Yeah But at least like the double-a is dead.

156
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:40,540
Speaker 1: and but now it's kind of like this double-edged sword.

157
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,660
Speaker 1: We have these great proprietary batteries for everything that are all rechargeable, so everything has its own charger.

158
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:49,520
Speaker 1: Yes, and you don't have to buy double-a's, but now we have to keep everything charged.

159
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, when we go to conventions everyone brings their own personal power strip.

160
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:57,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, it works out though and stuff seems to be staying charged long enough.

161
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,069
Speaker 1: I mean iPod goes for hours digital camera goes for hours.

162
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:00,932
Speaker 1: It's good.

163
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:10,752
Speaker 2: when I go places like on trips I have my Astro Boy lunchbox, and I put all my little gadgets in there with other chargers So I have my little lunch box.

164
00:12:10,873 --> 00:12:15,531
Speaker 1: I cut this stuff around All right, yeah, so we were talking about PC game.

165
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:22,417
Speaker 0: well PCs on Monday and PC games yes And there's a large large argument in the forums about it, which I would suggest you all read.

166
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,119
Speaker 1: well I came across today one more humongous argument against PC games and to why you probably shouldn't play them.

167
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:34,021
Speaker 1: They are Drms Apparently.

168
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,510
Speaker 1: you know a lot of games have copy protection.

169
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,617
Speaker 1: You know steam has it, but it steams isn't.

170
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,104
Speaker 1: it isn't really Hurting your computer.

171
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:44,374
Speaker 1: It's just you have to have an account broken is it really?

172
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:44,715
Speaker 1: yes.

173
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:46,399
Speaker 2: It is it doesn't work.

174
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:48,425
Speaker 1: Mine works anyway.

175
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:54,922
Speaker 1: There's a DRM for PC games called Star Force and apparently it's Bad.

176
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:57,792
Speaker 1: not as bad as the Sony DRM, but almost as bad.

177
00:12:57,912 --> 00:12:59,679
Speaker 0: Oh not as bad as the Sony DRM.

178
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:05,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't rootkit you, but it does screw up your computer And it can destroy your CD-ROM drive.

179
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:07,857
Speaker 1: just your CD-ROM will be broken.

180
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:08,700
Speaker 0: awesome.

181
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:09,363
Speaker 0: What does it do?

182
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:11,153
Speaker 0: rewrite the firmware or something it does?

183
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:12,098
Speaker 1: crazy stuff like that?

184
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:12,259
Speaker 1: Yeah?

185
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:20,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know if you buy I mean as much as I dislike the Xbox 360 And I have even more reasons just like it now which we don't have time to talk about really.

186
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,267
Speaker 0: But it's nice to say it sucks.

187
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,597
Speaker 0: It won't break your games.

188
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:29,217
Speaker 1: Well, it will if you turn it from vertical to horizontal while it's on.

189
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:36,556
Speaker 0: oh, yeah If you have an Xbox don't ever rotate it or knock it over 60 then you know.

190
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:45,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, there's a list I'm gonna link to of all these PC games some of which are pretty big PC games.

191
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:51,664
Speaker 1: I mean Splinter Cell 3 X III 13.

192
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,414
Speaker 0: it's called another game with David Duchovny.

193
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:54,380
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

194
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,588
Speaker 1: I know it's on the GameCube.

195
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:57,078
Speaker 1: so get the GameCube version if you want to.

196
00:13:57,098 --> 00:13:59,515
Speaker 0: yeah It's David Duchovny's in that the X-Files guy.

197
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:04,820
Speaker 1: all right There's a bunch of games on here and installing any dead to rights.

198
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:09,999
Speaker 1: These games will basically screw up your computer big time and it.

199
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,348
Speaker 1: I don't know why you'd play them on the PC.

200
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:18,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, all right though They're made much better gaming news.

201
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:23,480
Speaker 0: a bunch of reporters and people have gotten to actually test drive the Nintendo Revolution controller.

202
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,747
Speaker 1: Well, they did test drive it.

203
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:25,150
Speaker 1: I think it.

204
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,427
Speaker 1: when they unveiled the thing at E3 Oh, yeah, but those were demos.

205
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:34,169
Speaker 0: These are like they took a level from Metroid Prime 2 and they.

206
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,258
Speaker 1: that's what the tech demos were when they were at e3.

207
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:38,591
Speaker 1: Yeah, and these are the exact same things.

208
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:40,280
Speaker 1: only now they're letting more people use them.

209
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:49,947
Speaker 0: a lot of people are using them and CNN has an article about it and These are people who many of them aren't even gamers and Pretty much all the reviews are glowing.

210
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,496
Speaker 0: They say such things as wow that was amazing.

211
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:52,978
Speaker 0: It's perfect.

212
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:53,480
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

213
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,499
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that I totally want to mess with one.

214
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,227
Speaker 2: I mean, I showed Macy the commercial.

215
00:14:57,328 --> 00:15:01,524
Speaker 2: Macy's my roommate and I showed her the commercial and she was like Pretty sweet.

216
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:02,989
Speaker 1: She was very impressed.

217
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,356
Speaker 0: I saw the controller like that unveiled it.

218
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:08,346
Speaker 0: I was like what the hell What are they thinking?

219
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:11,140
Speaker 0: And then I saw like two seconds to that demo reels.

220
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:17,860
Speaker 1: Ah Yeah, there's another video online that that someone made where some people are real idiots.

221
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:20,419
Speaker 1: They don't really understand how the revolution is gonna work.

222
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,173
Speaker 1: Someone made a video where it's like this is how it's gonna work.

223
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:24,520
Speaker 1: Damn you here it is.

224
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:25,305
Speaker 1: Now you get it.

225
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:27,399
Speaker 1: if you don't get it after watching this screw you.

226
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:32,705
Speaker 1: So if you still don't get it, you got to see this video More and more.

227
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:38,395
Speaker 0: I'm thinking the revolution is gonna make a big Splash in the game industry like Sony and Microsoft aren't ready for.

228
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:39,258
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna be.

229
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,653
Speaker 1: you know The kind of curve where it grows a little bit.

230
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:42,599
Speaker 1: It goes a little bit and there's a lot.

231
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:47,510
Speaker 0: Well, the Microsoft's generating a lot of ill will over the Xbox.

232
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,536
Speaker 1: was that a natural log, I think I'm not sure.

233
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:53,252
Speaker 0: a Natural log would pretty much be impossible.

234
00:15:53,272 --> 00:15:58,338
Speaker 1: Oh, okay in short order I I forget which sorts of functions make the graphs that do what I think.

235
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:01,673
Speaker 1: Cuz it's been a while But yeah.

236
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:05,179
Speaker 1: So there was this contest on in gadget today.

237
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:15,340
Speaker 1: Actually, it was a week of contest and they were giving away gadgets every day of the week And Basically there was a different thing that you needed to do for each day of the week.

238
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,619
Speaker 1: so like on Tuesday, they said something during their podcast of what to do to win the prize.

239
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:25,879
Speaker 1: and to win the prize today, all you had to do is post a comment saying what the prize was.

240
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,905
Speaker 1: and They didn't tell you what the prize was.

241
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,932
Speaker 0: there any limit to how many comments you can post.

242
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:33,420
Speaker 1: any one person can post one guess.

243
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:38,116
Speaker 1: The big catch was that you couldn't just say something like Dell monitor.

244
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:41,789
Speaker 1: you had to say Dell 2405 fpw.

245
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:44,157
Speaker 1: you had to say exactly which gadget it was.

246
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,180
Speaker 1: now What's occurred here is something that's very very interesting.

247
00:16:49,963 --> 00:17:00,330
Speaker 1: There are let me get the current count 1362 comments posted in the single blog entry and There are very very few duplicates.

248
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:11,424
Speaker 1: so now what we've basically done is made a list of every gadget that people want and Actively desire and think is cool enough to be a prize in this contest.

249
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:13,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of them are Nintendo.

250
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:25,589
Speaker 1: Well, there's a disproportionate number of Nintendo gadgets because in the blog post they use the question block as the Because they were like question mark and they put a question block.

251
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,599
Speaker 1: So people started Giving Nintendo guesses to me.

252
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:32,990
Speaker 0: I would not guess Nintendo because that's too obvious.

253
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,553
Speaker 1: I'm beginning to think it might be Nintendo.

254
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:42,313
Speaker 1: But basically what they're gonna do is they're gonna search for the exact, you know name of the Gadget.

255
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:43,958
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, there's an update.

256
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:46,746
Speaker 1: Hold on a couple of you are pretty freaking close.

257
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:47,609
Speaker 1: No one's got.

258
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:52,107
Speaker 1: oh wait They do have a winner but way to almost break the news incorrectly.

259
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,887
Speaker 1: Ah Okay, but no there was an update that was made between when I left work.

260
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:59,915
Speaker 1: when I left work There were like 600 of these and they hadn't bitten.

261
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:09,089
Speaker 1: So this update was between now and then Where some people were close, but they're looking for a specific version model or addition of a device.

262
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:16,318
Speaker 1: Wow so people had it, but they didn't have the Version number, right?

263
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:21,240
Speaker 1: So it might have been like someone might have guessed like iPod But it was probably like iPod u2 edition.

264
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:26,563
Speaker 1: or someone might have guessed Nintendo DS But it was like Nintendo DS Mario Kart edition or something.

265
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,290
Speaker 0: See this one was all you.

266
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,839
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't really read and gadget.

267
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,790
Speaker 0: I like gadgets, but I don't buy many gadgets.

268
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:36,190
Speaker 0: I just like looking at them so I don't even bother with in gadget.

269
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:41,370
Speaker 1: No, I like in gadget because it's like if you reading gadget in gizmodo you get all the gadgets.

270
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:44,949
Speaker 1: But there's also Akihabara news, which is like Akihabara.

271
00:18:45,251 --> 00:18:45,993
Speaker 1: Yes, they had.

272
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:47,238
Speaker 1: that's the best gadget site.

273
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:50,550
Speaker 1: cuz you get all these Japanese gadgets that you'll never be able to own ever.

274
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,433
Speaker 2: Actually, it's really cool.

275
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:53,055
Speaker 2: If you go there.

276
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:54,961
Speaker 2: Yeah, my favorite bit.

Speaker 2: Where was he from?

280
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:14,764
Speaker 2: I think it was Panama and we called him Ken and I was with Ken and Akihabara one day and we were going Shopping at game stores, and there was this one game store.

281
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:16,250

00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:46,970
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah So, you know a little a little sketchy there and you know these these weird kind of hentai looking PC games.

286
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,799
Speaker 2: I'm like, hmm.

287
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:48,709
Speaker 2: Let's go back downstairs.

288
00:19:50,332 --> 00:20:04,499
Speaker 2: Ken who has no idea what all this stuff is He's kind of like hmm and he's wondering about and he ends up Smacked up in the middle of the yaoi game section and I know this podcast Has like way too much yaoi already.

289
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,590
Speaker 2: what with like you guys wouldn't stop talking about cluster edge.

290
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,450
Speaker 1: It was hilarious, but it was just like because he could have been such a good show.

291
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:22,110
Speaker 2: But if you guys would ask me about this stuff, like I know I could have told you right away It's like it's straight-up BL On our own and then we scream about it.

292
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,666
Speaker 1: It's funnier when the anime is structured in such a way where you don't find out.

293
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:26,490
Speaker 1: so like 10 minutes.

294
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,050
Speaker 2: Anyway, Ken was just standing there being like what what and he's like poking at stuff and looking at stuff.

295
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,995
Speaker 2: It'd be like what is this?

296
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,770
Speaker 2: and there are like these school girls in the corner?

297
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:42,982
Speaker 2: Just like dying laughing because there's this gaijin over there like in the middle of the yaoi game section Just like hooking at everything.

298
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:49,218
Speaker 2: They're like, oh my god You know, it's getting embarrassing.

299
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:50,281
Speaker 0: it was like what.

300
00:20:50,562 --> 00:20:51,625
Speaker 0: what's the matter?

301
00:20:53,070 --> 00:21:02,484
Speaker 2: Oh My but anyway Akihabara is a real fun place and you know, you can get laptops for like $69 but they're kind of sketchy and very very old.

302
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:03,890
Speaker 0: Hey sketchy and old is fine.

303
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,456
Speaker 0: $69 for a laptop.

304
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:12,734
Speaker 1: those are useful for something man as long as the battery is good Whatever But easy adapting.

305
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:17,347
Speaker 2: but anyway, there's there's some cool stuff going down in Akihabara.

306
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:20,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Personally like Shibuya myself.

307
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:30,986
Speaker 1: So I found something today.

308
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:33,510
Speaker 1: Well, I had found a few things today, but one of them really stood out.

309
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:41,610
Speaker 1: It was a flash game and you know yesterday that would think there was a command and conquer flash game And I think we saw Warcraft flash game out of the command and conquer one.

310
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,890
Speaker 0: I never actually got to see the link died like immediately.

311
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:45,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, it came back up, but it wasn't worth the trouble.

312
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:53,481
Speaker 1: But anyway today I found an entire brand new SNES style Zelda game made entirely in flash now.

313
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,509
Speaker 0: I have one really serious question about this.

314
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:57,520
Speaker 0: Why is tingle in it?

315
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,290
Speaker 0: And why is he like the first guy you meet?

316
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,769
Speaker 1: I don't know because I haven't played the game more than a minute, but I do know this.

317
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,730
Speaker 1: I didn't read the text from when you talk to tingle.

318
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:15,397
Speaker 1: but it might be funny and it might be making fun of tingle because as soon as you talk to him a bomb shows up and Normally link uses bombs as an item.

319
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:20,114
Speaker 1: This bomb seems to follow link around like it's a Party member.

320
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:21,870
Speaker 2: It's it's his pal awesome.

321
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:28,975
Speaker 1: So I think this is just a really silly parody but also possibly quality Flash Zelda game.

322
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,662
Speaker 1: that might be worth the time.

323
00:22:30,722 --> 00:22:32,289
Speaker 1: It takes to play it, huh?

324
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:36,189
Speaker 0: Though uh to segue into a real-world tingle.

325
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:47,217
Speaker 2: My god, I was gonna talk more about flash because my entire life has been Can you make a Zelda game?

326
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:56,890
Speaker 2: I actually I'm not that good with the interactive Want to learn how to make a game but I use it a lot for like.

327
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,622
Speaker 2: Actually, I don't use it so much for web animation either.

328
00:23:00,642 --> 00:23:10,175
Speaker 2: I've been using it to actually do a lot of my you know 2d elements for my movies and It works pretty well.

329
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:37,949
Speaker 2: I like the flash and it actually saves me a lot of work When I draw right into the computer, so and Scott's making faces at me like Anyway anyway going into my thing of the day Which is actually a borrowed thing of the day from Scott because I spent all day reading you know Korean modernism assignments about oh European colonialism.

330
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:46,850
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I guess if you don't want to hear lectures about that I can tell you about hard gay and hard.

331
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:49,627
Speaker 2: so that kind of fits in with my whole.

332
00:23:49,647 --> 00:24:01,468
Speaker 2: I was going to Akihabara thing and So, you know I've been kind of distant from the Japanese pop culture scene for a couple years since I moved to college.

333
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:13,223
Speaker 2: and Anyway, there was something Scott showed me today in Google video Apparently one of the Japanese top comedians and a lot of advertisements and stuff.

334
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:17,929
Speaker 2: He's called hard gay and Looks exactly the way you raise.

335
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:25,810
Speaker 2: It's like completely over-the-top like biker gear with the hat and these you know.

336
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:47,530
Speaker 2: He runs around as basically this guy who's like being very over-the-top like gay biker dude running around an office and just messing with stuff and like taking pictures of his face in the copier and In the end he ties himself up with Christmas lights and puts him self up on the billboard of Yahoo, Japan.

337
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:50,689
Speaker 0: He's like I am the boy from Yahoo, Japan.

338
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:56,435
Speaker 2: It's I don't know.

339
00:24:56,455 --> 00:25:01,330
Speaker 2: I just I can't picture Yahoo in America pulling one of those sort of commercials.

340
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:03,870
Speaker 2: It was it was pretty entertaining.

341
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:10,148
Speaker 1: Isn't it funny how in America like like gayness is like half the people think it's evil, but in Japan, it's.

342
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:10,810
Speaker 1: it's hilarious.

343
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:14,118
Speaker 2: I gotta be perfectly frank.

344
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:36,929
Speaker 2: like a lot of anime fans and stuff in the States think since there are so many, you know Be shown and you know ambiguous There's so much gender Confusion and stuff in anime and manga that Japanese society must be much open to this sort of thing.

345
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:42,282
Speaker 2: and actually, you know, there's still a lot of problems with prejudice.

346
00:25:42,523 --> 00:25:49,361
Speaker 2: and you know, I think Both societies need to learn to be more open and accepting of the whole.

347
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:50,043
Speaker 0: Yeah.

348
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:56,400
Speaker 0: Well, I point out that South Africa made Gay marriage and it's like wow, the world has.

349
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,705
Speaker 2: you know, I'm 21 years old.

350
00:25:57,745 --> 00:25:59,030
Speaker 2: The world has changed.

351
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:02,521
Speaker 1: People aren't really any more tolerant of gayness.

352
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:04,890
Speaker 2: they are they are they're not like the.

353
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:19,810
Speaker 2: In the past couple years you just seen Just like this really big Backlash by Christian fundamentalists and this it's like god forbid our government turned into a theocracy.

354
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,303
Speaker 2: It's really starting to make me nervous.

355
00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:23,590
Speaker 2: What would the religious right?

356
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:28,250
Speaker 2: Commanding the amount of power it does in our political system?

357
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:29,097
Speaker 2: I mean, I'm sorry.

358
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:36,398
Speaker 2: I don't want to When it comes to being this stupid.

359
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:40,897
Speaker 2: and if you start being a bigot if you start being a bigot I don't care if I offend you.

360
00:26:41,138 --> 00:26:43,489
Speaker 0: So yeah, I mean offend people.

361
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,384
Speaker 2: I'm a bigot only against bigots.

362
00:26:46,545 --> 00:26:56,544
Speaker 0: So whoo Hey, hey Now it's weird that we have three things the day and as we were about to start this bit I didn't have a thing of the day ready.

363
00:26:56,786 --> 00:27:02,700
Speaker 0: Good job I was sitting here and I was just about to hit record and I thought alright I need to find something amusing quickly.

364
00:27:03,142 --> 00:27:06,976
Speaker 0: FARC will provide and came through in spades.

365
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:12,733
Speaker 0: the number one link on FARC as I'm speaking is Well there.

366
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:19,037
Speaker 0: first of all, it was a link to lyrics to Christmas carols, but not just any Christmas carols Cthulhu.

367
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:27,053
Speaker 0: Christmas carols Cthulhu photography In Playing the MP3.

368
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:28,757
Speaker 1: I mean we're talking Rudolph

369
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:29,559
Speaker 2: the red-nosed cultist

370
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,274
Speaker 0: Carol of the old ones.

371
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:40,947
Speaker 0: Oh come all ye deep ones, but they don't rhyme and meter the way.

372
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:42,893
Speaker 1: they should know They're close enough.

373
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:43,575
Speaker 1: I think you just.

374
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:48,027
Speaker 1: it's like they have a different syllable in mind and they don't Know.

375
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:54,750
Speaker 2: You think being blasted with them since Halloween would have kind of ingrained them in the gray matter.

376
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:56,459
Speaker 1: But no, yeah, but I mean they're cultists.

377
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,349
Speaker 0: They don't like listening to Christmas carols.

378
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:09,924
Speaker 1: These Christmas carols, you know We need we need a way to like an XML standard format where you can type in like sheet music And then a web browser that can render it so you can actually read it.

379
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:11,109
Speaker 1: That would be really useful.

380
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,995
Speaker 1: Software yeah But I'm talking like I can.

381
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:26,730
Speaker 1: anyone can write sheet music using an open standard format and then web browsers and things will render it Properly so that way you can make websites with music on them And if you're writing lyrics or something, then people could see oh, that's how you sing.

382
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,240
Speaker 0: That would be pretty except it's illegal to share lyrics.

383
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,269
Speaker 1: now only if they're real MPA lyrics You can share these if you made them up.

384
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,204
Speaker 2: Yeah I say if you make something up and you want to share I think it's something.

385
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:37,726
Speaker 2: go you.

386
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:37,867
Speaker 2: yeah.

387
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:39,854
Speaker 1: if someone made this Technology and made it work.

388
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:49,706
Speaker 1: I think what we'd see is a lot of people writing music or a lot of people like Distributing their songs that they wrote to get people to sing them and all kinds of stuff.

389
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:51,418
Speaker 1: That'd be real handy It would be.

390
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,328
Speaker 1: maybe we should do it.

391
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz one.

392
00:28:53,835 --> 00:29:00,042
Speaker 0: if it took off we'd be famous and rich - even if it only took off a little bit We get some freaking music for the podcast.

393
00:29:00,384 --> 00:29:03,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely All right.

394
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:06,617
Speaker 0: So, uh our main bit today.

395
00:29:06,637 --> 00:29:20,643
Speaker 0: and we came up with this not too long ago and we came up with it because old lady's hair But shaving which may not sound like a geek topic but cat attacks.

396
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:23,330
Speaker 0: there's been a big movement among geeks lately.

397
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:27,909
Speaker 0: There's a lot of like life hackers and people and and people like us.

398
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:32,265
Speaker 0: Where we're going back to old-school shaving old-school shaving is where it's at.

399
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:42,843
Speaker 0: as in instead of spending You know a hundred dollars every couple months on like Mach 3 razor blades and using shaving cream that smells like deodorant We buy using you know a badger hair brush

400
00:29:43,147 --> 00:29:44,814
Speaker 2: and Shaving foam

401
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:49,447
Speaker 0: and an actual like safety razor that you put a real razor blade into.

402
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:53,350
Speaker 1: yeah at first I thought the first thing that you got to worry about is are you gonna cut yourself?

403
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,998
Speaker 1: The answer is no.

404
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:57,030
Speaker 1: it's called a safety razor for a reason.

405
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,518
Speaker 0: Dangerous one is the straight razor.

406
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:01,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, the straight razor do not go for.

407
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:02,530
Speaker 1: I mean the straight razor.

408
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:07,270
Speaker 1: You could be all cool, but you have to learn to sharpen it with the strop and everything.

409
00:30:07,913 --> 00:30:09,240
Speaker 2: Whim was like for a while.

410
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,110
Speaker 2: He was like, I want to buy a straight razor.

411
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:14,400
Speaker 2: I am gonna buy a straight razor and sharpen it with another thing.

412
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,387
Speaker 2: I'm like, no don't know.

413
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:17,309
Speaker 0: I thought it would be cool.

414
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,618
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought it would be cool to your nose.

415
00:30:19,678 --> 00:30:22,710
Speaker 1: Thank you, but then I realized the de razor is just as good.

416
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:29,582
Speaker 0: Well, plus I pictured myself doing it and I thought alright I can get my chin And I picture trying to shave my that over your jugular.

417
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,990
Speaker 2: doesn't that just send chills up your spine?

418
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:33,039
Speaker 0: I'm not a barber.

419
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,181
Speaker 1: a couple times I never cut myself with the safety razor.

420
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:39,790
Speaker 0: Well, I shave every day and I shave against the grain.

421
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:41,214
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't shave against the grain.

422
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:42,237

423
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,160
Speaker 2: Speaking of shaving.

Speaker 2: No, I've heard it's got really good reviews and I might be going with my pop.

426
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:56,096
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're talking about at all.

427
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:58,262
Speaker 2: Oh my god scary.

428
00:30:58,463 --> 00:31:02,838
Speaker 1: It's a best musical to go see I mean What does that do with shaving?

429
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:04,385
Speaker 2: But oh it does.

430
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:06,493
Speaker 2: it's about a barber Oh people.

431
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:12,969
Speaker 2: and then they throw them down a chute and the lady downstairs makes them into mince pies and people eat them.

432
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:18,309
Speaker 1: Anyway Back to actually.

433
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,522
Speaker 0: But like it's we can't.

434
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,868
Speaker 0: I mean we thought there was some shill article a while ago.

435
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:33,774
Speaker 0: we saw yeah And it explained like there's this movement of people shaving with old technology because the old technology was actually better than the new Technology.

436
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:36,609
Speaker 0: the new shaving technology only exists to make money.

437
00:31:36,972 --> 00:31:38,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was like that makes sense.

438
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,710
Speaker 1: But this article seems like someone is really shilling out this website that sells old shaving stuff.

439
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:52,928
Speaker 0: So we did our own research and all signs pointed to yes Not only is it cheaper to save with a real old like 1950s style razor, but it's better.

440
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,834
Speaker 0: Yep It's better and cheaper.

441
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:55,476
Speaker 1: You know what?

442
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:56,740
Speaker 1: I got one.

443
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:57,704
Speaker 1: I got one.

444
00:31:58,045 --> 00:31:59,590
Speaker 1: it is better and it is cheaper.

445
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:01,398
Speaker 0: My shave is twice as close.

446
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,290
Speaker 0: I haven't cut myself like seriously in a long time.

447
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:05,169
Speaker 0: No more razor burn.

448
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:12,108
Speaker 1: Imagine if you could shave and it felt like just wiping a sponge on your face and then when you were done It felt like a baby's ass.

449
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:17,089
Speaker 0: Actually, no matter how close I shave I still have some stubble so that'd be well.

450
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:22,510
Speaker 1: It's visible like you see specks and like the first time I did it I was worried cuz they still saw black specks on my face.

451
00:32:22,832 --> 00:32:30,946
Speaker 1: I was like, oh no, but then when I rub my hand on it, I was like, oh Yeah so that's why I'm glad I'm not a guy.

452
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:35,710
Speaker 2: cuz The daily shaving bit, you know, I'm not a huge fan of shaving.

453
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:45,583
Speaker 2: I do it merely for public appearances so I can wear short plaid skirt because I like the pad and And I like short skirts, yeah, no, I don't do it merely for you.

454
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:47,008
Speaker 2: I just like the fashion.

455
00:32:47,088 --> 00:32:54,410
Speaker 2: but I You know winter is great cuz you know, you're never showing your legs a lot so you don't have to shave them a bunch.

456
00:32:54,813 --> 00:32:59,823
Speaker 0: I mean if I went to work with like a baklava over my face Shave that wouldn't go over.

457
00:32:59,864 --> 00:33:03,947
Speaker 1: so well Yeah, and I thought that people would get upset.

458
00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:08,364
Speaker 1: cuz you know I kind of have to wear kind of work clothes and you know, I like.

459
00:33:08,424 --> 00:33:10,070
Speaker 1: I only shave like once every three days.

460
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,681
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't really care at all.

461
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:14,107
Speaker 0: If I go one day without shaving.

462
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:17,060
Speaker 0: I have a beard Yeah, it's kind of annoying.

463
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:23,413
Speaker 2: Yeah The beard Yeah, it is fine.

464
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:27,685
Speaker 1: Anyway, the first thing you got to know about shaving the old-school way is what to buy.

465
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,913
Speaker 0: Yep, and basically You're all smart.

466
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:32,696
Speaker 0: Seriously.

467
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:37,550
Speaker 0: You just googles for like classic shaving to make you smell like a Nancy boy.

468
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:38,838
Speaker 0: Yeah, I smell like a Nancy boy.

469
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:40,127
Speaker 0: I smell like roses and lavender.

470
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:49,110
Speaker 2: now You know, you go to Crabtree and Evelyn new Rockefeller Plaza, they have all the old-school shaving stuff, but it's expensive.

471
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, this isn't expensive if you buy it online.

472
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:51,861
Speaker 0: Yep.

473
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:52,202
Speaker 0: We got.

474
00:33:52,223 --> 00:33:53,930
Speaker 0: we got a couple websites that are really good for it.

475
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:55,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we'll also link to the MS.

476
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:57,829
Speaker 1: We'll just link to the MSN article that had the real deals.

477
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,497
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'll just trust us.

478
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:02,570
Speaker 0: while this article might sound like someone was paid to write this stuff up.

479
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:03,918
Speaker 0: No, it we're serious.

480
00:34:03,938 --> 00:34:05,830
Speaker 0: I shave with this stuff like constantly.

481
00:34:06,032 --> 00:34:08,130
Speaker 1: So the first thing you need is a double edge razor.

482
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:09,929
Speaker 1: You probably want a safety razor.

483
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,389
Speaker 1: Don't you want to get a heavy one to the heavy one?

484
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:18,127
Speaker 1: You don't have to push as hard because the weight leans against your face and you're not gonna cut yourself.

485
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,442
Speaker 0: Yep, or your legs I mean women use these two.

486
00:34:20,462 --> 00:34:20,522
Speaker 0: Yep.

487
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:24,489
Speaker 1: So anyway, you want to buy a double edge safety razor?

488
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,596
Speaker 1: It's not double edge.

489
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:28,270
Speaker 1: Like there are two blades like one on top of the other.

490
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:30,023
Speaker 1: It's one on one side and one on the other.

491
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:33,909
Speaker 1: so you can shave Flip it around shave some more and then rinse it off.

492
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,766
Speaker 1: Yep, and basically it means the blade lasts twice as long.

493
00:34:37,248 --> 00:34:43,203
Speaker 0: now He said you want a heavy one and that's true very much because a light one You have to regulate the pressure with your hands.

494
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:49,654
Speaker 0: a heavy one You literally just hold it let it rest against your skin and then let it glide out duck across your face Mm-hmm.

495
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:52,909
Speaker 1: and as for a beginner That's definitely what you want in life.

496
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,295
Speaker 1: You get a high amount of skill.

497
00:34:54,636 --> 00:35:04,927
Speaker 1: you can get a slightly closer shave with the lighter razors and you know All kinds of different fancy ones with comb open combs closed combs all kinds of crazy things, but just don't worry about that.

498
00:35:04,947 --> 00:35:07,897
Speaker 1: I Got the beginners razor and you know what?

499
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:10,768
Speaker 1: I'm probably never gonna buy anything better because it's good enough.

500
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:15,061
Speaker 2: Yeah Wow, it sounds comfortable sounds like you're not scraping hair.

501
00:35:15,081 --> 00:35:16,124
Speaker 2: Yeah body.

502
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:18,310
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, which is what I always think of shaving.

503
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,026
Speaker 2: It's like all time to scrape the hair off.

504
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:24,159
Speaker 0: Oh Plus, I mean they're high quality blades like you.

505
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:27,330
Speaker 0: take a Mach 3 which is like the most popular razor for men.

506
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:30,179
Speaker 0: You don't like one stroke with it and it's already dull.

507
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:30,822
Speaker 1: Yeah.

508
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:31,966
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I want.

509
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:33,210
Speaker 1: I remember my bio teacher.

510
00:35:33,571 --> 00:35:39,930
Speaker 1: He was teaching in 11th grade taught us about scanning electron microscopes and he had a picture of a razor, right?

511
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,250
Speaker 1: He said well, he didn't even tell us it was a razor.

512
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:42,932
Speaker 1: He's like what's that?

513
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:48,090
Speaker 1: And it's like you see this edge full of like these big pits and holes and jaggies, right?

514
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:49,476
Speaker 1: And you're like, huh?

515
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:50,522
Speaker 1: He's like that's a razor.

516
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:52,010
Speaker 1: We're like, wow, that's a pretty used razor.

517
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:58,009
Speaker 1: Then he shows us another one with bigger holes twice as many pits and like deadly jaggies.

518
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,209
Speaker 1: And he's like, that's the used one.

519
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,324
Speaker 1: The other one is brand new and I'm like, holy crap.

520
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:05,670
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

521
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:09,076
Speaker 0: Now those Mach 3 type blades.

522
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:11,222
Speaker 0: they cost a lot of money a lot of money.

523
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:17,703
Speaker 0: the blades you need for a safety razor It's about five cents a blade and they've got platinum in them.

524
00:36:17,723 --> 00:36:19,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're platinum coated.

525
00:36:19,771 --> 00:36:22,719
Speaker 0: So if you like platinum platinum is worth something man.

526
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:24,664
Speaker 1: Yeah, and actually it's a lot.

527
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:26,670
Speaker 1: platinum is actually the real deal.

528
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,347
Speaker 1: it does something as opposed to the.

529
00:36:29,294 --> 00:36:29,798
Speaker 1: What did they say?

530
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:31,390
Speaker 1: diamond coating crap?

531
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:32,949
Speaker 1: They yeah, that's not real.

532
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:38,030
Speaker 0: But the main difference is the blades are actually higher quality because there's just one of them and it's a real razor blade.

533
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:41,460
Speaker 0: So it won't go dull as quickly as whatever cartridge razors you might use.

534
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:44,690
Speaker 0: and to even better the blades are so cheap.

535
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:48,510
Speaker 0: I change blades like once or twice a week because it's just so cheap.

536
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,337
Speaker 0: I might as well use the sharpest blade I can.

537
00:36:50,458 --> 00:37:02,562
Speaker 1: there are also people who seem to think that you know The cartridge razors will start out sharp get a little bit dull and then stay at that Dullness for a very long time and you can just keep using them.

538
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:04,189
Speaker 1: one guy even said he used them for a year.

539
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:08,383
Speaker 1: that's probably a bad idea because then you're what you're looking for.

540
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:14,110
Speaker 1: things like razor burn or Ingrown hairs or not a very close shave at all.

541
00:37:14,514 --> 00:37:15,850
Speaker 1: Can't imagine it would be comfortable.

542
00:37:16,572 --> 00:37:22,070
Speaker 1: The general rule for knowing when a razor is dull is if you shave and you feel it tugging on your hairs.

543
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:33,472
Speaker 0: time to change because if it tugs on the hair either it's gonna rip the hair out which hurts a lot or It's gonna pull the hair out cut it and the hair is gonna go back in and now you're real likely to get an ingrown hair.

544
00:37:33,815 --> 00:37:39,479
Speaker 1: I got ingrown hairs with the You know the normal cartridge razors a lot.

545
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:45,823
Speaker 1: as soon as I switch to this, you know old-school shaving I haven't had an ingrown hair and freaking forever.

546
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:49,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's great Especially if you have sensitive skins.

547
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:51,715
Speaker 0: now the next big component I mean either razor.

548
00:37:52,379 --> 00:37:54,310
Speaker 0: now you need a brush a shaving brush.

549
00:37:54,411 --> 00:37:56,670
Speaker 1: The brush is the most important ingredient.

550
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,051
Speaker 1: You can.

551
00:37:57,111 --> 00:38:05,333
Speaker 1: probably if you just use a brush your same shaving cream and everything you use now, but you use a brush It'll improve your shave Tenfold.

552
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:06,799
Speaker 0: now it can't be any.

553
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:09,210
Speaker 0: you don't want to get like just a brush you see in the store.

554
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,957
Speaker 0: You have to get a badger hair brush.

555
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,342
Speaker 0: That sounds stupid.

556
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:12,965
Speaker 0: We're not kidding.

557
00:38:13,145 --> 00:38:16,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, the There are boars hair brushes.

558
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:17,809
Speaker 1: You can buy in CVS for five bucks.

559
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:19,714
Speaker 1: That's like sandpaper.

560
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:20,697
Speaker 1: that'll scratch your face up.

561
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,082
Speaker 0: It'll hurt like it really.

562
00:38:22,122 --> 00:38:22,905
Speaker 0: it's a bad idea.

563
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,289
Speaker 0: The money you save is not worth it.

564
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:29,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, a badger hair brush is expensive, but it's so soft and so nice.

565
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:32,478
Speaker 0: and oh Badgers are so soft.

566
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:33,263
Speaker 0: I want to pet badger.

567
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,376
Speaker 1: Yeah So vicious.

568
00:38:35,637 --> 00:38:38,290
Speaker 2: it's like that's not a computer that's a rabid Wolverine.

569
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:39,534
Speaker 2: I was.

570
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:44,630
Speaker 2: I was reading that your penny arcade comic today and it brought tears and nostalgia to my eyes.

571
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:48,363
Speaker 2: Those are old strips, you know, you know, we had a published one.

572
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:48,845
Speaker 2: Yeah.

573
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,250
Speaker 0: Oh, I love penny arcade.

574
00:38:50,551 --> 00:39:01,865
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so there are badger hair brushes that are like ultra super badger hair brushes made only of neck hair Because they say the neck hair of the badger is the most soft.

575
00:39:01,985 --> 00:39:02,588
Speaker 1: You don't need that.

576
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:03,150
Speaker 1: You don't need that.

577
00:39:03,756 --> 00:39:08,339
Speaker 0: That's just trying to get your money Because a brush like that they'll charge hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

578
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,222
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

579
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:09,764
Speaker 1: Just don't go.

580
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,808
Speaker 1: it's unnecessary.

581
00:39:10,968 --> 00:39:12,635
Speaker 0: even better I learned recently.

582
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:22,496
Speaker 0: I found out why the neck hair from the badger is so prized Because the ends of it are frayed which means the brush will retain more water in it Which we'll get to in a second.

583
00:39:22,556 --> 00:39:23,503
Speaker 0: retaining water is key.

584
00:39:23,925 --> 00:39:33,050
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm If you have a normal badger hair brush over time the ends fray and it's the same as having a neck hair brush Mmm, so there's no reason to buy the neck hair brush.

585
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:38,215
Speaker 0: Just buy a normal brush and use it a lot and as it wears out it'll get better and a brush will last you years And years and years.

586
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:47,210
Speaker 1: so don't worry about buying it for like 40 bucks Because the money you save on the cheap razors compared to the cartridge will more than pay for that brush and the comfort of the shaving.

587
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:48,247
Speaker 1: I can't put a price on.

588
00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:56,902
Speaker 0: yep As long as you take like let it dry out like don't just stick it in a closet or in a medicine cabinet where they get Moldy it'll last literally 10 20 years.

589
00:39:57,124 --> 00:40:00,829
Speaker 0: Yep, like no exaggeration Most people buy one or two brushes in their entire life.

590
00:40:01,472 --> 00:40:06,310
Speaker 1: Now the last thing you're gonna need is cream because the cream from the can really won't cut it with the brush.

591
00:40:06,712 --> 00:40:12,842
Speaker 0: Yeah, and once you switch to a real shaving cream it Shaving is no longer this chore you do in the morning.

592
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:14,249
Speaker 0: It's this pleasant ritual.

593
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:18,071
Speaker 0: It feels good and it refreshes you Yep.

594
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:24,408
Speaker 1: Now the cream that we get comes in a little tub and you kind of when you we'll talk about technique next.

595
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:27,349
Speaker 1: but There's a. what's the brand?

596
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:31,503
Speaker 1: Something of London bond of Taylor of Old Bond.

597
00:40:31,523 --> 00:40:31,804
Speaker 1: Yes.

598
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,090
Speaker 1: That's the brand that we get.

599
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:38,072
Speaker 0: It's very.

600
00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:44,050
Speaker 0: I mean they talk about how it's like the mixture is handmade in London or somewhere in Britain and it's actually shipped here.

601
00:40:44,391 --> 00:40:50,677
Speaker 0: yeah, it's actually not really that expensive and all it is it's glycerin and Fragrance.

602
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:55,863
Speaker 2: Yep Stuff in it, too Cuz I don't like aerosol cans.

603
00:40:55,904 --> 00:40:57,956
Speaker 2: I think they're evil Mmm.

604
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,429
Speaker 1: Well, the tub is just as non-evil as the can.

605
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:04,963
Speaker 0: Yeah, just a nice little tube whatever and it smells really nice like it's.

606
00:41:05,203 --> 00:41:07,610
Speaker 0: it's perfume, but it doesn't smell like perfume.

607
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,333
Speaker 0: It just smells good.

608
00:41:08,554 --> 00:41:12,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you don't want perfume I got because I have really sensitive skin and stuff.

609
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,970
Speaker 1: I got the hypoallergenic one, which doesn't really have a like anything?

610
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:19,301
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's good because I don't want it to smell like anything.

611
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:21,310
Speaker 1: But if you do want to smell they have what rose?

612
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:27,842
Speaker 0: Yep, apparently the most popular among men who use this are rose and lavender But they have a whole bunch of different scents.

613
00:41:28,165 --> 00:41:31,310
Speaker 2: Yep Apparently lavender is the really traditional one.

614
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:36,290
Speaker 2: Like my mom found out that you guys use like the fancy shaving cream and she thought that was pretty cool.

615
00:41:37,012 --> 00:41:39,940
Speaker 2: Yeah, lavender is a traditional male scent.

616
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:40,622
Speaker 0: Actually.

617
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:44,196
Speaker 0: I've wanted lavender and both times I tried to order it It was sold out.

618
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:44,619
Speaker 0: Wow.

619
00:41:45,062 --> 00:41:46,050
Speaker 0: Sorry I ended up with rose.

620
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:53,645
Speaker 1: There's places you can get it in New York probably seriously It's just hard to find these places because they don't advertise pretty loudly the internet.

621
00:41:53,665 --> 00:41:54,428
Speaker 1: It's easy to find.

622
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:59,090
Speaker 1: Yeah So anyway now that you've got all your equipment you got to get the technique.

623
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,129
Speaker 0: Basically, you know with a Mach 3 or a shlick or whatever.

624
00:42:03,511 --> 00:42:10,075
Speaker 0: Basically, it seems to be the harder you push and the harder you scrape yourself and the more repeatedly you scrape yourself The smoother the shave is.

625
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:10,638
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

626
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,933
Speaker 0: It's the exact opposite with a real razor Mm-hmm.

627
00:42:14,394 --> 00:42:26,270
Speaker 1: What you were gonna do is the first thing I know about shaving is that the water and The cream are there to lubricate your face so that the razor just slides across the skin.

628
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:32,250
Speaker 0: Water more than anything water is the most important part in this hot water as hot as you can get without burning yourself.

629
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:36,850
Speaker 0: Honestly, you want to stop up the sink and fill it with hot water and leave it full of hot water the whole time.

630
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,139
Speaker 1: You shave the hottest water that your sink can produce.

631
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,476
Speaker 0: if you didn't shower right before you actually want to dip a washcloth in The water and soak your face.

632
00:42:43,898 --> 00:42:46,210
Speaker 0: Just hold the hot cloth against your face for a couple minutes.

633
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:59,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you don't when you heat up your face with the hot water The water helps to lubricate your face when you're gonna get the razor on there, but it also opens the pores so the hairs kind of come out and Then it'll.

634
00:42:59,554 --> 00:43:01,730
Speaker 0: you'll get a much cleaner closer shave and it'll feel a lot better.

635
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:07,110
Speaker 1: Yep, next you want to put the brush in the water and make sure it absorbs a lot of water.

636
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:11,350
Speaker 0: Yep, usually while you're filling the bowl you just drop the brush in there and let it kind of float and fill up with water.

637
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:16,550
Speaker 1: Yep, and as soon as the brush is filled with water and you're ready to shave your face is nice and hot and wet.

638
00:43:17,172 --> 00:43:25,062
Speaker 1: You take the brush and you kind of shush it around in the tub of cream But only do it a little bit because that cream lathers up like crazy.

639
00:43:25,162 --> 00:43:27,170
Speaker 0: a little goes a long way is an understatement.

640
00:43:27,432 --> 00:43:29,484
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I freaking I don't even shush it.

641
00:43:29,585 --> 00:43:30,370
Speaker 1: I used to shush it now.

642
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:41,190
Speaker 1: I just kind of dab it in there once like dab Like like literally just yep Then take the brush and go around your whole face going up and down and swirly swirly with the brush.

643
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:42,154
Speaker 0: Yep, and don't rush it.

644
00:43:42,234 --> 00:43:42,656
Speaker 0: Enjoy it.

645
00:43:42,717 --> 00:43:47,394
Speaker 0: I mean, it feels good feels really good and what I'll Fascinating.

646
00:43:47,576 --> 00:43:47,898
Speaker 2: Yes.

647
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:49,250
Speaker 2: I didn't know how this worked either.

648
00:43:50,993 --> 00:43:54,470
Speaker 1: Well, what happens is the brushing is to dual purpose.

649
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:58,368
Speaker 1: The first purpose is to get the cream covering all the hairs of your face.

650
00:43:58,468 --> 00:44:03,030
Speaker 1: every place You're gonna shave should be covered in cream and it will lather up and cover it all.

651
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:05,143
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you'll probably get it in your nose in your mouth.

652
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:05,566
Speaker 0: Don't worry.

653
00:44:05,606 --> 00:44:06,130
Speaker 0: It can't hurt you.

654
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,950
Speaker 0: It's not like the stuff you buy in an aerosol can and it doesn't taste bad.

655
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,827
Speaker 1: I try to avoid the nose and mouth and I've gotten pretty good at it.

656
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:16,910
Speaker 2: Yeah What was that kind of shaving cream you used to use before like the the stuff?

657
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,440
Speaker 2: No, it smells like like roses smells real nice.

658
00:44:19,681 --> 00:44:20,183
Speaker 2: The other stuff.

659
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:28,289
Speaker 0: It was like like the man I used to use like gold spice or something and I haven't worn it recently, but for most of my life I use Stetson.

660
00:44:29,012 --> 00:44:30,100
Speaker 0: I wear Stetson cologne.

661
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,550
Speaker 0: I use Stetson aftershave.

662
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:36,872
Speaker 2: I cover the inside of the shower Stetson cuz you left it there Like.

663
00:44:36,933 --> 00:44:39,765
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, you used up all my freaking shaving cream.

664
00:44:39,785 --> 00:44:40,287
Speaker 0: It was fun.

665
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:42,676
Speaker 0: I was like I'm drawing in the walls.

666
00:44:42,716 --> 00:44:43,238
Speaker 0: This is great.

667
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:48,162
Speaker 2: I called him on the phone and be like I Used all the stuff you left at my house, which was great.

668
00:44:48,182 --> 00:44:49,530
Speaker 0: when I try it wanted to shave and I didn't.

669
00:44:50,952 --> 00:44:51,513
Speaker 1: And then the.

670
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:57,371
Speaker 1: the second purpose of the brush is that the brush will actually grab the hairs and pull them out a little bit More.

671
00:44:57,391 --> 00:45:05,750
Speaker 1: so you have a hot wet creamy face and you have this brush Pulling the hairs as far out of the pores as they can go without being pulled out of your face.

672
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:10,650
Speaker 0: Yep, but it doesn't pull them out so far that you'll get an ingrown hair like you do with like the mock three.

673
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,101
Speaker 1: Yeah, you won't feel the hairs being pulled out of your face.

674
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:14,950
Speaker 1: But no they are being pulled.

675
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:20,150
Speaker 0: So yeah, and then you just take the razor and it's really hard to hurt yourself.

676
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,860
Speaker 0: Just you know, don't be dumb never slide it sideways.

677
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,804
Speaker 0: Always slide it down.

678
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:24,285
Speaker 1: Yep.

679
00:45:24,566 --> 00:45:26,784
Speaker 1: If you slide it sideways You're pretty much gonna cut yourself.

680
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:27,250
Speaker 1: Yeah

681
00:45:28,215 --> 00:45:41,659
Speaker 0: Now if you're worried about cutting yourself, or if you use an open comb Which basically just means you'll get a closer shave, but it's more dangerous By a styptic pen they're like two bucks and if you cut yourself you just poke you dab it once with this pen and it'll Stop bleeding.

682
00:45:41,945 --> 00:45:46,690
Speaker 1: Yep I've never had really had a need because I'd never had like, you know a gusher.

683
00:45:47,052 --> 00:45:50,830
Speaker 1: Maybe if I had like a little bump on my face from something it would get cut but it would just go away right away.

684
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:56,610
Speaker 0: Yep, I've cut myself once or twice but they were miners usually because I was trying to get a real close shave for some reason.

685
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:59,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you get like a serious cut then you did something wrong.

686
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:03,505
Speaker 2: I'm just thinking both both my uncles Dave and John.

687
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:06,521
Speaker 2: they both shaved their heads, you know It's like as soon as they started to go bald.

688
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:07,710
Speaker 2: They're like, I'm shaving my head.

689
00:46:09,131 --> 00:46:17,930
Speaker 2: they're both really cool the ones from Chicago ones from San Francisco and Uncle John was just I was remembering him talking about shaving his head.

690
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,237
Speaker 2: It's like, you know, that's the stupidest thing.

691
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,886
Speaker 2: you're walking around with toilet paper stuck to your dome.

692
00:46:22,926 --> 00:46:32,780
Speaker 2: That's So, you know, it's like that that styptic pen is is probably Probably a boon if you don't want to look like an idiot.

693
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:34,066
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, though.

694
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:36,116
Speaker 0: We don't want to scare you You probably won't need one.

695
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:37,181
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're like you're.

696
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:39,090
Speaker 0: it's really hard to hurt yourself with these things.

697
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,382
Speaker 1: I haven't cut myself seriously at all.

698
00:46:41,805 --> 00:46:45,629
Speaker 1: It's not a straight razor It's a double-edged razor and when you see it, you'll know what we're talking about.

699
00:46:46,651 --> 00:47:01,852
Speaker 1: So all I do is I just lean it against my face the razor Drag it down until you know, it's kind of like alright That's about as much as I can shave in one stroke I Take it I flip it around to the other side where the other razor is and I do the equal amount of shaving on the other side Of my face.

700
00:47:01,892 --> 00:47:06,269
Speaker 0: the more hair you have or the thicker it is the shorter more more frequent rinsing you want to do.

701
00:47:06,551 --> 00:47:07,999
Speaker 0: Yeah short strokes rinse often.

702
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:08,642
Speaker 0: Yep.

703
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:19,770
Speaker 0: Keep that razor clean Keep it to keep your face hot and wet everything hot and keep everything wet and most importantly the first time you shave You go with the grain all the way around.

704
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:21,816
Speaker 0: Then you can stop there if you want.

705
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:25,850
Speaker 0: if you want a really close shave do it again going against the grain.

706
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,177
Speaker 0: Yep, that's the way that's more dangerous.

707
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:31,950
Speaker 0: You'll probably cut yourself before you learn how to do it, but the shave is incredible.

708
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:39,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you shave up you shave your whole face down then start from the beginning and shave your whole face up You're.

709
00:47:39,677 --> 00:47:48,469
Speaker 0: you won't probably won't even see little specks Like I do it maybe once a month like I do it before a special occasion like a fancy dinner I'm gonna see someone because it's it's kind of tough to do.

710
00:47:48,751 --> 00:47:54,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do it and I can get away with it But sometimes I get a little bit of razor burn under the chin or some ingrown hairs.

711
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:58,741
Speaker 1: So I only do it if there's something like right today.

712
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:01,207

740
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:10,156
Speaker 0: I've gone through about 40 blades But I have a very thick beard.

741
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:14,717
Speaker 1: Yeah now you can buy the blades that are like fancy and platinum on the internet And they're pretty cheap.

742
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:23,798
Speaker 1: They're like maybe five bucks or something But if you're kind of cheap, you can get them at the grocery store and they're not as good as the platinum ones But they're almost as good.

743
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:25,307
Speaker 2: or you can pick them up at the.

744
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:28,197
Speaker 2: you know The post-production center at NYU.

745
00:49:28,237 --> 00:49:30,483
Speaker 2: they they provide you with a tray of razor blades.

746
00:49:30,564 --> 00:49:34,148
Speaker 2: when you start your semester of sight and sound film Cuz you act well.

747
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:40,892
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was like This.

748
00:49:41,032 --> 00:49:48,510
Speaker 2: there's this class you get to take your sophomore year and you actually get to deal with like a positive film Strip, you know like a actual.

749
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:57,310
Speaker 2: And so you're cutting with a razor and you're splicing and it's very nice You know, it's a very tangible approach to media and it is really kind of cool.

750
00:49:57,642 --> 00:50:08,747
Speaker 2: You know This is before you move into all the digital forms of editing and so you're working in the little tiny Steenbeck room with this cleaning solution that makes you feel really weird and really like.

751
00:50:08,948 --> 00:50:12,117
Speaker 2: you've got to keep Ventilation and they provide you all these razors.

752
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:12,819
Speaker 2: and so I'm like.

753
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:16,630
Speaker 2: you sent me to college to get high and play with razors.

754
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:20,599
Speaker 1: How do you paste the film together after you cut it?

755
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:22,261
Speaker 1: it's Tape.

756
00:50:22,582 --> 00:50:28,639
Speaker 2: oh, it's like you make a splice with a razor blade and then there's this tape with perforations that match the.

757
00:50:29,582 --> 00:50:31,720
Speaker 1: So if you mess up you can just tape it back together.

758
00:50:32,222 --> 00:50:35,351
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know, you got to be careful where your place.

759
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:38,300
Speaker 2: cuz every time you splice you can kind of see the tape.

760
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,731
Speaker 2: Yeah, it goes by so fast that it's not really obvious.

761
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:43,556
Speaker 2: But a lot of splices don't look - yeah.

762
00:50:43,597 --> 00:50:45,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got you Huh?

763
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:46,734
Speaker 1: All right.

764
00:50:47,037 --> 00:50:50,631
Speaker 0: Yeah This went on a lot longer than we expected which is awesome.

765
00:50:51,032 --> 00:50:54,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially since we did a short crap show yesterday We promised we'd make up for it.

766
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,563
Speaker 0: We did so.

767
00:50:55,844 --> 00:51:07,244
Speaker 2: I felt kind of like the third wheel like I. they've got a dynamic going and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to Interject, you know, I'm kind of sitting here like and when they talked about saving I'm like, this is a world I've never entered into.

768
00:51:07,485 --> 00:51:10,797
Speaker 2: you know, I've got to talk about something they can't can't relate to.

769
00:51:10,898 --> 00:51:12,544
Speaker 2: that's cool I can have my keep in mind.

770
00:51:12,585 --> 00:51:16,220
Speaker 0: I mean for all you listen and for you, this was very much like an experiment.

771
00:51:16,321 --> 00:51:19,699
Speaker 0: We weren't sure how we would deal with having someone who wasn't one of us on the show.

772
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this whole episode is kind of an experiment.

773
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,576
Speaker 0: I like the way it turned out turned out.

774
00:51:23,597 --> 00:51:24,320
Speaker 0: All right, we're learning.

775
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:36,150
Speaker 0: I mean, it's hard like if you said in yesterday's episode like I face away from everyone else in the room so I can't see if other people are like signaling me sometimes and We it's kind of hard for us to communicate.

776
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:38,400
Speaker 0: sub channel where you guys can't hear while we're talking.

777
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:41,416
Speaker 1: Maybe we should get the DS's and the picto check going on or something.

778
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:44,319
