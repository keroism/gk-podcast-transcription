1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,590
Speaker 0: It's Monday, June 7th, 2021.

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,011
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:14,760
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek night.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,618
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:27,534
Speaker 0: So the other day we are recorded geek nights the last show that you probably listen to Like you do Scott sends me the audio.

6
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:38,126
Speaker 0: if you listen to it You shouldn't but if you listen to the Thursday episodes So we finish it and Scott sends me the audio and usually I don't actually look at that until after I eat dinner do some Other stuff, but I'm like, you know what?

7
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:40,095
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get it done now and I open it.

8
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:50,380
Speaker 0: and You know, I'm a I am a skilled professional audio engineer I know my biz and when I open Scott's file, I see it looks wrong.

9
00:00:50,581 --> 00:01:05,322
Speaker 0: There's something wrong with it because the spectral display shows that I can see like mouth sounds from Scott Wiggling through that view like I can hear I could like I can look at it and see like lip and tongue action going on Right.

10
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:15,160
Speaker 1: Well what happened was I had reinstalled windows for other reasons, which means I reinstalled audition Which means I got a clean install and then I made a new template because I guess I blew the old one away.

11
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,512
Speaker 1: All right, maybe I didn't but I didn't want to bother finding it.

12
00:01:17,532 --> 00:01:18,999
Speaker 1: So I just made a new one.

13
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:20,605
Speaker 1: So I was just like new.

14
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:28,039
Speaker 1: I was like new and I saw that there were new options because I hadn't you know Seen any of this stuff before because I hadn't reinstalled audition in forever, right?

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,851
Speaker 1: So it was like new and it said like podcast.

16
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,221
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh that seems like a good idea Podcast.

17
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:40,907
Speaker 1: and then I was like, okay, and then I saw that it made a bunch of tracks like host interview Like oh, it's trying to be clever.

18
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:44,100
Speaker 1: Okay, so I just deleted all the tracks except for host which is me.

19
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:49,077
Speaker 1: And then I was like, you know, I saved that as the nice template.

20
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:58,819
Speaker 1: I'm like, okay apparently that template In places that I didn't look included effects and filters that I was not using.

21
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:14,144
Speaker 0: Yeah If you're not familiar with multi-track audio editing on actual professional software, not like the audacity stuff Basically, you'll have a bunch of tracks and each track has an input like what physical thing or virtual thing is sending audio to it And an output.

22
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:17,680
Speaker 0: where is that going which for most people is like main output?

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,271
Speaker 0: But could be something else for the for my template for geek nights.

24
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:21,636
Speaker 0: It's actually something else.

25
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:25,920
Speaker 0: I use a bunch of buses And each track has non-destructive effects.

26
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:30,080
Speaker 0: It's literally like it's called the effects rack because it's almost like in the old days.

27
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:37,480
Speaker 0: you'd have a rack with like a Compressor and then a reverb and then all the devices you needed and you just daisy chain that shit together.

28
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:50,559
Speaker 0: So in audition You just literally have a list of all the effects and they are just applied in real time on playback to each track in order and you can enable disable the whole effects track.

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:58,270
Speaker 0: and basically that template called podcasting which I looked I didn't realize that even existed because I didn't know existed either and I was just Like oh why not?

30
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:09,139
Speaker 0: I ignore Defaults in audio because the one thing about audio engineering is that there's no such thing as intelligent defaults Unless you're in a calibrated studio.

31
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:13,595
Speaker 0: Most people are not Like that even down to the like.

32
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:21,480
Speaker 0: in my setup Every single vu meter you can look at on all my physical devices all the like cutout devices in audition.

33
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:23,686
Speaker 0: Everywhere you could possibly see a volume.

34
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:28,760
Speaker 0: They're all actually the exact same volume, but that is not true for most people's pipeline.

35
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:41,679
Speaker 0: so if you have like a compressor or an auto leveler or something and You tell it to use the default like start compressing the audio above 10 decibels That is gonna work for like one dude and no one else.

36
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:47,220
Speaker 1: So anyway, I removed it and I resaved the podcast and that problem was solved once you figured that out.

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,390
Speaker 1: But in the course of doing this we figured out some other things.

38
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:50,891
Speaker 1: one.

39
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,560
Speaker 1: I was having that saving the metadata problem.

40
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:55,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's apparently just gone now.

41
00:03:56,082 --> 00:04:00,240
Speaker 1: Mysterious what was causing it but I guess reinstalling all of Windows and audition solved it.

42
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:05,240
Speaker 0: Okay, great, but the other thing for the longest time Scott would send me the audio and it was fine.

43
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,169
Speaker 0: But there was a notch everywhere.

44
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,260
Speaker 0: frequency was actually at because I can't open it.

45
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:11,385
Speaker 1: basically It's a horizontal line.

46
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:27,204
Speaker 1: like you look at the audio and you can see that it's like there's some sound Happening at a steady at a particular frequency and if you listen to just that sound it would probably sound something like D. You know something like that, right just this constant sound Coming from somewhere.

47
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:31,160
Speaker 1: So it's like you look at the wave and it's me talking and then you look at this thing.

48
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:32,331
Speaker 1: It's just always there.

49
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,179
Speaker 1: It doesn't go away.

50
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,759
Speaker 1: It's like what the hell is that?

51
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,320
Speaker 1: But the thing is because it's a straight line like that.

52
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,380
Speaker 1: It's very easy to edit it out because you can just say remove all sound at this particular frequency and there it's gone.

53
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:45,459
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm a lot more clever than that.

54
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:52,793
Speaker 0: But basically yeah I use a process where I capture up I take a part where Scott's not speaking Because the automation and audition like that's what you're paying for.

55
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:54,802
Speaker 0: This is not an ad for audition It's just.

56
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:58,360
Speaker 0: there's no better software to make a podcast and I use it a lot.

57
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,749
Speaker 0: I've been using it for since it was cool at it.

58
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:05,628
Speaker 0: I've been using this thing for like 20 plus years Before it was even owned by Adobe.

59
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:12,260
Speaker 1: So anyway, the point is we got rid of it And then but in the course of solving the problem, you know, I was like, you know what?

60
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,893
Speaker 1: I'm gonna finally figure out what the fuck this line is, right?

61
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:19,395
Speaker 0: And the funniest thing is yes Scott records new audio and he's like the lines gone.

62
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:20,260
Speaker 0: I don't see a line.

63
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:26,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm like, well there must be you know, cuz I had thought So there's.

64
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,229
Speaker 1: basically I'm using this device.

65
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,760
Speaker 1: It's popular as the audio interface is the focus, right?

66
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:39,542
Speaker 1: Scarlett - I - right I was you know, and apparently these focus right ones are pretty popular and rim was like, ah, it's crappy He's right.

67
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:46,573
Speaker 0: I was saying that it is not as high quality as what we use in the studio But anyway way better than any consumer device.

68
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:48,160
Speaker 1: It's very popular.

69
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:49,906
Speaker 1: There are alternatives though.

70
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:54,080
Speaker 1: Anyway, and then I got the SM 57 or a microphone an old rely.

71
00:05:55,262 --> 00:06:03,474
Speaker 1: the problem is is that the dynamic microphone if I was using the Cardioid microphone that uses the phantom power, right?

72
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:04,740
Speaker 1: That would be plenty good.

73
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,020
Speaker 1: But the dynamic microphone is not loud enough for this little focus, right guy.

74
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:14,280
Speaker 1: So I'd have to crank up the preamp in the focus, right till I get it to be loud enough.

75
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:18,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, and when you do that, you're also cranking up the noise in the focus, right?

76
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I could.

77
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:23,988
Speaker 0: so that when we started using this new process, you know kovat times for over a year I've been recording remotely.

78
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:34,775
Speaker 0: I could definitely see now This is where you know that the viewer talking about the spectral view, you know in movies where they do like a voice Analysis and they show this like pink and red looking thing.

79
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:35,840
Speaker 0: That's what I'm talking about.

80
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:45,331
Speaker 0: Anyway, you can always see there was a little more noise in Scott's recording then in then in my local recording But not enough to matter and you can see that little notch there.

81
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:47,380
Speaker 0: There's just horizontal line just hanging out.

82
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:48,809
Speaker 1: So so I went.

83
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,900
Speaker 1: well I went and I said, okay, you know I'm cranking up the preamp in this focus right thing too much, right?

84
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,842
Speaker 1: It's better if I turn it down because it's kind of noisy Right.

85
00:06:57,343 --> 00:07:00,352
Speaker 1: and I found I researched and I found out there's these things they sell.

86
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:06,513
Speaker 1: the one I got is the fathead something And what it does is basically a pre preamp.

87
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:15,583
Speaker 1: you stick it in the bottom of your microphone and Then you stick the XLR cable into bottom of that and what it does is it's like look your microphone is not using the phantom Power.

88
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:17,879
Speaker 1: it's a you know, it's a dynamic mic.

89
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:26,695
Speaker 1: We're gonna take that phantom power though because you have it right and we're gonna use it to amplify the signal from the dynamic microphone.

90
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:38,880
Speaker 1: and that happens before You hit the preamp in your audio interface and therefore you get the amplification Right and you could turn the preamp way down and get less noise.

91
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:41,479
Speaker 1: So this is you know, I got this thing and it was pretty great.

92
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:46,040
Speaker 1: But when I got it, that's when the line appeared and that's when rim was like, oh that thing sucks.

93
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,253
Speaker 1: There's something wrong with that thing.

94
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:47,859
Speaker 1: you got that.

95
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,166
Speaker 0: Problems like that before.

96
00:07:51,187 --> 00:08:02,412
Speaker 0: they're easy to troubleshoot where free preamps in particular But also just noisy apps might have like a shielding problem or it might have internal noise and you'll get like a like noise At a particular notch.

97
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:08,340
Speaker 1: not bad I mean that was yeah, so it was a possibility that this fathead thing was responsible for the line.

98
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:21,068
Speaker 1: but I didn't really believe it too much because People online like audio engineer people on the internet were like, oh this thing's fucking great This is like the best thing and it was totally awesome Right, and I was like, hmm.

99
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:23,600
Speaker 1: Why is everyone saying it's awesome and it's causing this line?

100
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,440
Speaker 1: Well, we solved the problem.

101
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:38,087
Speaker 0: apparently the culprit of the line in the audio was The ring light over here and the way we figured this out was because Scott sent video or audio again And the line wasn't there.

102
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:41,340
Speaker 1: I was so that literally I was like what I was like, what's different?

103
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,311
Speaker 1: I'm using the thing right now is different.

104
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:47,363
Speaker 1: when I it was because it was after the show We weren't streaming.

105
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:51,740
Speaker 1: the light wasn't on and that's why there was no line in the audio.

106
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:56,352
Speaker 0: And what I asked Scott was what did you turn off any lights?

107
00:08:56,433 --> 00:09:08,140
Speaker 0: because one thing that I know is that LEDs especially cheap ones are Noisy as fuck in the RF world and they will cause audio interference and all sorts of equipment.

108
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:22,874
Speaker 1: So what was actually happening is I did some tests and what I found out was that the the RF whatever Coming out of that light, you know radio wise that's you know It only gets picked up by the microphone itself, right.

109
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:26,669
Speaker 1: so if there's no it's not the XLR cable It's not shielding on the interface.

110
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:28,740
Speaker 1: It's not the little pre preamp, right?

111
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, the microphone itself is the only thing that picks up that for you know signal from the light.

112
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:40,950
Speaker 1: So if I don't have a microphone and I don't get Well, I cannot use the microphone right?

113
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:52,085
Speaker 1: So what was actually happening was Without the pre preamp I had to put the microphone really close to the light for it to pick up that line And I could.

114
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:59,520
Speaker 1: I could actually see it happening as I moved the mic closer to the light That the line was like appearing and disappearing right and the in the audition.

115
00:10:00,322 --> 00:10:03,380
Speaker 1: But once I attached the pre preamp it was boosting the signal.

116
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:08,763
Speaker 1: So now even though the microphone is further away from the ring light You could still.

117
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:15,140
Speaker 1: the line was still getting picked up because the pre preamp was amplifying the tiny tiny thing that the microphone is picking up.

118
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,200
Speaker 1: So I turned the light off because the sun's shining in the window and the Sun sets not till like eight.

119
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:29,060
Speaker 1: We're not gonna be podcasting around then so we'll see how that goes but in the winter It's still only gonna need a light and that is see me sitting here with my eyes closed.

120
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:36,737
Speaker 0: That is like the kind of thing that honestly like if you're podcasting or doing anything with audio and like you're this this Conversation is interesting to you.

121
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,169
Speaker 0: Those are the kinds of things that come with experience real just know.

122
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:41,352
Speaker 0: like what could cause?

123
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:45,669
Speaker 0: like if that notch was at 60 Hertz I know exactly what was causing it.

124
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:49,657
Speaker 0: the fact that it was not at 60 Hertz implied It was interference or a noisy preamp.

125
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:55,762
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not worth it to me to buy a more expensive light that might not do this and a more expensive light might still Do it.

126
00:10:55,922 --> 00:11:06,000
Speaker 0: so because more expensive lights are still built with cheap components LED lights Especially like the kinds of stuff you'll use for a podcast or a video game stream.

127
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:10,460
Speaker 0: They're just either not shielded at all or like violate all sorts of FCC rules.

128
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,344
Speaker 0: They're just.

129
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,480
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do an experiment though with some tinfoil and see what happens.

130
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:17,389
Speaker 1: I might make a tinfoil shield result.

131
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:28,398
Speaker 0: Yep, and the only reason I'm not having a problem with all the lights around me is one I buy a name-brand prevent like cool lights here but to my audio device is heavily shielded because it's really fancy.

132
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,511
Speaker 0: but This is where like know you're know what you're doing.

133
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:34,483
Speaker 1: Well, this is all my audio device isn't the problem It's only the.

134
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:35,266
Speaker 1: the microphone is.

135
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:36,250
Speaker 1: the is the weak point.

136
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:38,619
Speaker 0: arguably the audio device should protect itself.

137
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:40,623
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

138
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:42,890
Speaker 1: it's not protect itself from what it's not written.

139
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,131
Speaker 1: the single isn't coming from the light into the audio interface It's going into the microphone.

140
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:48,340
Speaker 1: The thing is shielded.

141
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:53,809
Speaker 1: It's if I don't if I take you know, the microphone far enough away I guess yeah right away from the light.

142
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,447
Speaker 1: but the it audio interface is right next to the light Doesn't pick up the line.

143
00:11:57,548 --> 00:12:06,919
Speaker 0: Yep, unless you get a shielded microphone Oh, which is difficult or do what you're about to do or like like what I was doing Just put a notch filter in the way to get rid of that noise.

144
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,111
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, that was we finally solved all the mysteries.

145
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:11,377
Speaker 1: Thanks to reinstalling windows.

146
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,892
Speaker 0: Yeah So there's a bunch of news.

147
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:15,840
Speaker 0: we'll talk about a few of them.

148
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,185
Speaker 0: There's one little one I actually want to talk about because this is.

149
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:22,299
Speaker 0: I didn't realize this was a problem because I just didn't think about it.

150
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:36,695
Speaker 0: So only recently like right now our Carriers like phone carriers going to start sending vertical location data elevation when someone calls 911 in the u.s.

151
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,860
Speaker 0: Previously, they only sent like latitude and longitude like where's the address?

152
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,400
Speaker 1: Oh, because that's all the GPS system will tell you to get the elevation You need to use other sensors in the phone to figure out how high up you are.

153
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,509
Speaker 0: Well GPS can sort of tell it.

154
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:54,220
Speaker 0: GPS can tell you elevation depending how many satellites you're looking at.

155
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,845
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of.

156
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:56,577
Speaker 1: I guess that's possible.

157
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:56,860
Speaker 1: Yes

158
00:12:57,362 --> 00:13:18,912
Speaker 0: It's more than the problem was more that the system that was set up to collect this data Display it to like the people answering the phones is really complicated and very prescribed and it was basically an IT Problem to get everything in place to send this data and the carriers complained that they're having so much trouble doing this.

159
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:26,502
Speaker 0: the FCC actually mandated to send Vertical like height information in 9-1-1 calls in 2015.

160
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:28,873
Speaker 0: The deadline to do so was June 2nd.

161
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:37,555
Speaker 1: Problem is right is that they meant that you know, that's the correct process.

162
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:38,880
Speaker 1: right you come up with a standard.

163
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, right you met you man you government mandates it, right?

164
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,340
Speaker 1: Everything was done correctly, right and the carriers are just you know, taking their sweet-ass time.

165
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:51,440
Speaker 1: And I think the problem is that you know, what's the penalty for them not doing?

166
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,261
Speaker 0: Ah, that's.

167
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:59,234
Speaker 1: I'm glad you asked that because the penalty for them not doing it was what they got fined a little bit or nothing Right up.

168
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:07,099
Speaker 0: So the news is that this is going live quickly now because the June 2nd deadline was approaching.

169
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:19,480
Speaker 0: AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon all Apparently independently of each other said that they needed an 18th my 18 month extension Because they had trouble testing this due to COVID.

170
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,793
Speaker 0: The government's response was we fucking told you in 2015.

171
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:23,254
Speaker 0: That's right.

172
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:35,700
Speaker 0: so the FCC began an Investigation into these three companies in April this year to find out what was taking so long the three carriers.

173
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:38,031
Speaker 1: They're just taking their sweet-ass time on purpose.

174
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:48,260
Speaker 0: Yep, shit the three carriers Magically suddenly said yo yo yo, we'll get this done within seven days if stop investigating us And we'll pay a hundred grand each.

175
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:49,926
Speaker 0: Please leave us alone.

176
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:52,360
Speaker 0: So yeah, this is happening imminently.

177
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:55,611
Speaker 0: And if you're not if you can't figure out why this is a big deal.

178
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:58,340
Speaker 0: most people in America live in cities.

179
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:06,337
Speaker 0: cities tend to be pretty vertical and If some random person calls 911 and they're in trouble and they can't say where they are in a building.

180
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:11,416
Speaker 0: and you know The police the fire department whoever shows up at a 50-story building.

181
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:12,340
Speaker 0: now what?

182
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:19,240
Speaker 1: Even in a even in a place where there aren't skyscrapers right suburb, you know the an awful suburb, right?

183
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:20,304
Speaker 1: It's important.

184
00:15:20,324 --> 00:15:23,277
Speaker 1: It could help you if you know that someone's in the basement or the second floor.

185
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:23,940
Speaker 1: There's like a fire.

186
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's huge, right?

187
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:32,560
Speaker 0: Just like an office building that might be empty like the people at the door won't necessarily know that there's a problem inside.

188
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,286
Speaker 1: You know that could be.

189
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:36,051
Speaker 1: that could be the difference in life and death.

190
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:42,218
Speaker 1: if the firefighters know you're in the second They check like the bedrooms first and then you happen to be in the basement.

191
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:45,170
Speaker 1: you good You know, you're a you're a you're a nerd living in the basement.

192
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:45,933
Speaker 1: They didn't know that.

193
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,819
Speaker 1: It's like that could be it You know, yeah.

194
00:15:49,262 --> 00:16:01,180
Speaker 0: so this is an absolutely good thing and I'm glad the government turned the screws and While I wish the fines were bigger and the investigation continued the fact that they buckled Instantly under that little bit of pressure the good was done.

195
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,408
Speaker 0: The government actually did what I expect the government to do.

196
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,833
Speaker 1: so, you know.

197
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:12,230
Speaker 1: if I was in charge though, you know The penalty should be right is You know, they always come with like these fines and stuff, right?

198
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,060
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, we'll find you X dollars or whatever, right?

199
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,103
Speaker 0: It should just be.

200
00:16:16,163 --> 00:16:19,132
Speaker 0: every time you fuck up the government takes a larger share of owning you.

201
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,740
Speaker 1: No, no, no too complicated too complicated.

202
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:22,586
Speaker 1: It's very simple.

203
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:23,150
Speaker 1: You ready?

204
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,600
Speaker 1: His is very very easy.

205
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,764
Speaker 0: I'm ready for the Scott plan.

206
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:30,520
Speaker 1: your deadline for doing the thing is reasonable amount of time, right?

207
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:34,519
Speaker 1: As if you hit that deadline and it's not done.

208
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:40,098
Speaker 1: All the service you provide to customers is free of charge until the point at which you fix it, huh?

209
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,009
Speaker 0: You can't collect how GDPR works and that they find you.

210
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:47,800
Speaker 0: There is no cap on the fines if you violate GDPR.

211
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:49,600
Speaker 1: But don't bother calculating fine.

212
00:16:49,680 --> 00:17:12,641
Speaker 1: Just be like the service is free if you and if you bill anyone Right during that if you bill anyone even one cent any customer at all Even one cent during that time period at which we are mandating that you provide your service for free Right or you you do anything right you anything even one cent shady Like you hold back on a service call that you know, cuz someone's service is broken or you know Anything.

213
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:19,079
Speaker 1: you cut back anything at all whatsoever in terms of your service level or you charge any customer even one cent.

214
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:22,140
Speaker 1: CEO goes to jail until a time at which it is fixed.

215
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:25,050
Speaker 0: well at least in this case that the key with that kind of the fine.

216
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:32,571
Speaker 1: and oh not just the CEO all the board members have To go to jail - I think that's the simpler way is still and they don't go to easy jail They go to the.

217
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:35,928
Speaker 0: the nasty Already put me in the home.

218
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:36,914
Speaker 0: We'll put you in the crooked home.

219
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:37,840
Speaker 0: We saw in 60 minutes.

220
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,199
Speaker 1: That's right.

221
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:46,903
Speaker 0: But I'm saying the GDPR thing works pretty well because the way it works is it's a percentage of your gross Global revenue.

222
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:49,733
Speaker 1: Well, that's good because that's good because at least it scales.

223
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:51,800
Speaker 1: I appreciate the fact that it scales.

224
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:52,759
Speaker 1: You know, that's nice.

225
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:56,660
Speaker 1: But I still I still prefer like the you can't charge anyone.

226
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,420
Speaker 1: Provide your service at the top level.

227
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:01,964
Speaker 1: You cannot decrease your service Providings and it.

228
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:06,779
Speaker 1: you must provide your service for free and in fact, if you get a new customer, it's free.

229
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:10,671
Speaker 1: I'm not just sign on for free.

230
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:13,573
Speaker 0: But another thing that happens in Europe That's not in the?

231
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:28,495
Speaker 0: u.s is certain job titles are regulated in a sense that the people who hold those titles for companies like this are personally liable for many kinds of criminal and civil infractions Irrespective of if they did it at the behest of the company,

232
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:31,674
Speaker 1: you know I actually want to just someone come.

233
00:18:31,774 --> 00:18:32,720
Speaker 1: I forget where I heard this.

234
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:42,324
Speaker 1: It might have been a podcast where I was listening to like Like an SEC lawyer or something like that, right and he was talking about how in you know The u.s.

235
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:45,380
Speaker 1: Right the financial guys are always trying to deregulate right?

236
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,846
Speaker 1: They want there to be less laws.

237
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:49,680
Speaker 1: if there's less laws, then they can be evil businessman, right?

238
00:18:51,222 --> 00:19:03,768
Speaker 1: But and he talked about how he spoke with a French finance, dude Like a French evil business guy, right and the attitude of the French evil business guy was like look I love these regulations, right?

239
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:07,220
Speaker 1: And the reason he loved them is because he had a moral compass.

240
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:18,220
Speaker 0: Well, I saw a situation in the u.s Like with a car mileage requirements and how there was this right-wing talking point that the car companies don't want these stupid requirements.

241
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:24,600
Speaker 0: But every interview showed that the car companies Affirmatively wanted those requirements because it makes a level playing field.

242
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,431
Speaker 0: It actually makes it harder for them to be competed with it.

243
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:29,639
Speaker 0: This is horses a moral compass on them.

244
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,773
Speaker 1: Well, this is different and that the French guy had a moral compass, right?

245
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:34,275
Speaker 1: Therefore.

246
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:35,880
Speaker 1: He didn't want to hurt anyone.

247
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,665
Speaker 1: He just right.

248
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:44,074
Speaker 1: so because of the regulations He was like, look, I don't have to like my job is way easy.

249
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,160
Speaker 1: I can do whatever the fuck I want.

250
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,932
Speaker 1: I know exactly where the lines are, right?

251
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:51,584
Speaker 1: Just don't do anything illegal Like.

252
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:55,745
Speaker 0: I hit people all these different ways, but I can't hit like this You can.

253
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,074
Speaker 1: I can just do whatever the fuck.

254
00:19:57,256 --> 00:20:02,559
Speaker 1: evil business I can come up with as long as I'm within these rules and I just stay within the rules.

255
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:10,410
Speaker 1: All the you know, the regulations are there and I never no matter how evil I am within those rules I don't have to feel bad about it.

256
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,755
Speaker 1: I can go home and sleep at night.

257
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:13,121
Speaker 1: I don't have to give a shit Right.

258
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:18,182
Speaker 1: It's like because I know that either you know a I'm not hurting anyone or B They're gonna.

259
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:31,040
Speaker 1: if I do hurt someone they're gonna regulate and fix it in which case I sort of actually did a good thing by Exposing, you know, whereas in the US it's like if you're an evil businessman, it's like, okay If you have no moral compass, then you can just do whatever evil you want, right?

260
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:41,760
Speaker 1: but if you have some sort of moral compass It's actually the deregulation actually makes your life difficult because you're constantly, you know, how do you sleep at night?

261
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,524
Speaker 1: It's like all right.

262
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:45,539
Speaker 1: Well, I want to do evil business you man stuff so I can make more money.

263
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,507
Speaker 1: Did I overstep or didn't I right?

264
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:49,289
Speaker 1: and you're so.

265
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:53,320
Speaker 1: if you actually have some sort of conscience then the lack of regulation?

266
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:02,586
Speaker 1: It can actually, you know give you a. you know a disturbance in your mind Or even if you don't have your mind can't be disturbed by anything But it still gives you a.

267
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:13,620
Speaker 0: I can go full throttle within these parameters Mm-hmm, then of course the regulations have to be updated and changed to deal with the consequences of you know loopholes in them.

268
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:15,037
Speaker 0: But that's a whole different conversation.

269
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if the speed limit is a hundred right?

270
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,928
Speaker 1: It's like you floor it and your car's going 100 you go Right, and you just you're just flooring it.

271
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:29,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if the speed limit is like on no speed limit It's like am I going too fast?

272
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,939
Speaker 1: Should I slow it down?

273
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,280
Speaker 1: right, you can't just Mindlessly floor it and go we and not have to care, right?

274
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that that that worrying about am I going too fast?

275
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:43,839
Speaker 1: can take away from the thrill of just going fast.

276
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:51,945
Speaker 0: So with some other news and this is Apple news not related to WWDC, but it's from June 3rd Air tags came out.

277
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:52,788
Speaker 0: Apple air tags.

278
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:53,953
Speaker 0: They're a pretty cool thing,

279
00:21:54,455 --> 00:21:55,078
Speaker 1: but I got some

280
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:55,560
Speaker 0: yep

281
00:21:56,763 --> 00:22:11,603
Speaker 1: Shout out to the listener who through with the 3d printer who printed a thing so I could test attaching an air tag to a bicycle which is a Which is apparently when you set up an air tag bicycle is one of the choices for you know default Thing you are.

282
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:14,691
Speaker 1: so Apple apparently thinks that that's an okay idea.

283
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:16,115
Speaker 0: So I saw people.

284
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:16,436
Speaker 0: it's like.

285
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:17,880
Speaker 1: I say it's like there's no guarantees.

286
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:20,363
Speaker 1: It's gonna like save you Like.

287
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,460
Speaker 0: but my news will provide is relevant to that in some ways.

288
00:22:24,983 --> 00:22:26,900
Speaker 0: But also it's a mixed bag.

289
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,820
Speaker 0: So Apple the problem with air tags.

290
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:34,600
Speaker 0: Not to say that there is not other technology that already exists that you can just use to do this evil shit.

291
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:41,419
Speaker 0: But air tags are very accessible way to spy on someone if you plant an air tag on them or their shit.

292
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:46,138
Speaker 1: Right, but if they have an Apple device of some kind which is gonna do not?

293
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:57,160
Speaker 1: most people Yeah, it depends but most people globally have Android phones Sure, but the the presence of Apple devices is actually what makes air tags work, right?

294
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,291
Speaker 1: It's like if there are no apples if there are no Apple devices anywhere.

295
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:06,284
Speaker 1: and let's say let's say I put an air tag in my in the inside of my Computer right case.

296
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:08,833
Speaker 1: I tape it to like the you know, the back of the motherboard, right?

297
00:23:09,394 --> 00:23:13,268
Speaker 1: Someone steals my whole fucking computer and They drive away with it.

298
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,139
Speaker 1: I don't know how they did this, but they do it, right?

299
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:27,671
Speaker 1: If they go somewhere with that computer and there are no Apple devices anywhere near them and Right, it's like the air tag is now useless, right it did.

300
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:47,220
Speaker 1: the air tags depend on an Apple device cut with you know that's updated enough with the proper radios coming near the air tag and Having signal at some point at which to sort of let the network know this air tag was in this location No Apple devices that this nothing's happening.

301
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:50,920
Speaker 0: So Apple made a few changes pretty early on to air tags.

302
00:23:51,401 --> 00:24:07,744
Speaker 0: one of the changes they made is they update at an updated version of iOS that if it detected an air tag that wasn't yours that hadn't checked in with the original phone like the account that set it up and it appeared with you too often for Too long.

303
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:09,576
Speaker 0: you would get a notification on your phone.

304
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:16,970
Speaker 0: that said AirTag found moving with you and you can have options like make it make a noise Disable it like all this.

305
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:18,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, so like right.

306
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:18,720
Speaker 1: so let's you know.

307
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,299
Speaker 1: Let's say I've got like in someone slip.

308
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,395
Speaker 1: I'm at a convention and someone puts an air tag in my bag right and I got an iPhone.

309
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:29,966
Speaker 1: and if that air tag is Now following me around everywhere I go, but it's not mine Apple's like.

310
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:31,355
Speaker 1: hey, there's an air tag near you.

311
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,160
Speaker 1: That's not yours.

312
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:40,043
Speaker 0: So when originally it didn't do that at all the update of newest version of iOS does this but only iPhones will give you this Notification.

313
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:45,487
Speaker 0: So if I spy on an Android user, they'll never get a notification But then they'd have if there's.

314
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:49,725
Speaker 1: no if that person doesn't have any iOS devices near them You won't be able to track them.

315
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:53,259
Speaker 0: But if anyone around them has an iOS device at any point the pings will pop up.

316
00:24:54,086 --> 00:25:02,242
Speaker 0: Yeah so the what I had the original threshold Apple set for this was three days and That's too long.

317
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:02,563
Speaker 1: That

318
00:25:02,624 --> 00:25:16,889
Speaker 0: is way too long and I'll link to an article where a reporter like successfully used air tags to like Heavily spy on a bunch of people she knew and Part of what she found was that a lot of people don't even notice those Notifications or like don't think about him.

319
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:22,050
Speaker 0: a lot of people don't update their iPhones Weirdly and wouldn't get the notifications.

320
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,975
Speaker 0: Well half her friends.

321
00:25:22,996 --> 00:25:25,566
Speaker 0: I mean Android She would see.

322
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:26,190
Speaker 1: I don't know about the.

323
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,800
Speaker 1: a lot of people don't update their iPhones.

324
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,639
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure there are people who don't or don't update them right away.

325
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:37,900
Speaker 1: But the if you look at the numbers that like almost all iPhones and iOS devices even old ones are updated to the news.

326
00:25:38,323 --> 00:25:40,940
Speaker 0: These experiments on April 30th is when she wrote the article.

327
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,340
Speaker 0: So we over the course of in April where the update that added this was pretty new full disclosure.

328
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:55,260
Speaker 0: but the other problem was because she is friends with those people and would Have a good excuse to see them at least once every three days.

329
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:58,020
Speaker 0: You could keep the tracking going forever and no one would ever get a notification.

330
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:01,806
Speaker 0: Maybe yeah, I mean directly sure.

331
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:04,194
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a whole article about it here, but she pulled it off.

332
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:07,658
Speaker 0: So, uh Apple is changing this now.

333
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:18,978
Speaker 0: So where they're not gonna say exactly when it'll go off because that'll make it easier for people to foil it But at some point between 8 and 24 hours of separation, it'll warn people that it's there

334
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:20,303
Speaker 1: Mmm,

335
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:24,160
Speaker 0: and they also announced that they are going to release an Android app.

336
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:30,200
Speaker 0: I am confident the Android app will both expand their network to all these Android devices.

337
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:40,060
Speaker 0: It depends but it also Primarily that the Android app is designed to tell Android users if a suspicious air tag is found moving with them.

338
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:50,359
Speaker 0: hmm the other part of this is that the air tags will also start making sounds if They're already made too long.

339
00:26:51,590 --> 00:27:01,394
Speaker 0: And of course I found a YouTube video someone uploaded like right like a month ago that shows the Trivial hack to completely disable an air tag for making any sound forever.

340
00:27:01,414 --> 00:27:03,560
Speaker 1: Oh, you can just open it and cut the speaker.

341
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:04,604
Speaker 0: Yep, or just open it.

342
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:05,527
Speaker 0: There's a magnet in it.

343
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:06,812
Speaker 0: Just remove this mode.

344
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:08,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the magnet is the speaker.

345
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:10,047
Speaker 0: Yep, just remove the magnet.

346
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,100
Speaker 1: In fact, most of the air tag is the speaker.

347
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if you remove the speaker entire.

348
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:16,800
Speaker 1: if you redesigned it without the speaker, it would be way smaller.

349
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:28,760
Speaker 0: So it appears the people who are excited about the like how easy it is to remove that sound seem to be two classes of people Creepy people is one like clade that I see like in the comments of this stuff.

350
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:45,179
Speaker 0: But the other clade are all doing the same thing Pointing it on their bike so they can track down their stolen bike and steal it back and/or get revenge Mmm, and they don't want the air tag to make noise and inform the person who stole their bike that there's an air tag there.

351
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:47,103
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's just.

352
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:51,239
Speaker 1: you know, all of these same concerns exist, you know, there have been devices.

353
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:51,580
Speaker 1: What are they?

354
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,384
Speaker 1: What's the thing called?

355
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:53,026
Speaker 0: Oh, there's that.

356
00:27:53,428 --> 00:27:54,553
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's the tile.

357
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:56,100
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of tile one, right?

358
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,055
Speaker 1: So the tiles was the popular one before but it wasn't the only one.

359
00:27:59,075 --> 00:27:59,940
Speaker 1: there's like Google glass.

360
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,412
Speaker 0: Everyone was so mad about Google glass.

361
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:02,299
Speaker 0: with a camera right there.

362
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:13,295
Speaker 0: You can go on Amazon and buy for even back when Google glass came out for way less than a glass cost a tiny Tiny camera that you could put on like your lapel that no one would ever see.

363
00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:15,182
Speaker 0: that records 24/7.

364
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:18,416
Speaker 1: Yep, it's like you're so upset of and it's like people are so upset.

365
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:21,851
Speaker 1: if you have like, you know Try to take a photo of them, right but it's like dude.

366
00:28:21,872 --> 00:28:23,720
Speaker 1: you just walk past ten security cameras.

367
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:24,850
Speaker 1: Hey, I guess what's wrong?

368
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:35,612
Speaker 0: I'm glad to see that Apple took the obvious ways that air tags could be misused Seriously, and they have made like real privacy.

369
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:38,080
Speaker 1: it privacy is their number one, you know selling point.

370
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:48,892
Speaker 0: But they clearly take it a very powerful approach now to balancing the dangers with the usefulness and they seem to be taking all these dangers very seriously and that's Honest praise for me.

371
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:59,413
Speaker 1: like And so that's the one thing they've been doing right, you know for the past like several years now all their keynotes Even even the one today, they're like privacy privacy privacy.

372
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:00,618
Speaker 1: We don't sell your data.

373
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:01,300
Speaker 1: Check this out.

374
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,034
Speaker 1: We added even more blocking of ads to Safari and iOS.

375
00:29:06,054 --> 00:29:06,596
Speaker 1: Look at all the shit.

376
00:29:06,616 --> 00:29:07,599
Speaker 1: We're blocking right?

377
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,404
Speaker 1: Yeah We're fucking over those ad people.

378
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:10,006
Speaker 1: real good.

379
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:11,812
Speaker 1: You know, we don't sell your data.

380
00:29:11,852 --> 00:29:14,019
Speaker 1: We're just selling new products for way too much money.

381
00:29:14,365 --> 00:29:14,592
Speaker 0: Yeah.

382
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:21,798
Speaker 0: So the other thing going on is all the other Apple news cuz WWDC is like ongoing right now.

383
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:26,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, so WDC this is usually, you know, it's a developer conference.

384
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:37,800
Speaker 1: This is usually winning and you're gonna get your news about you know, the OS updates and such right and this year There wasn't any like one thing that was like big exciting like whoa, right?

385
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,580
Speaker 1: It was lots of little stuff some of which interesting some of which may.

386
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:55,631
Speaker 1: Most of it was the typical Apple thing that they always do that I always bring up which is some functionality that already exists that other people already have an Apple Makes it a new feature and act like they're so great.

387
00:29:56,073 --> 00:30:07,659
Speaker 1: It's like what for example they added basically, like a KVM kind of situation where you put your iPad next to your Mac next to another Mac and you can use One keyboard and mouse and move them all the way across everything, right?

388
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,920
Speaker 1: It's like I have this mouse that borders thing and that's not even old right much older KVM ones.

389
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:23,809
Speaker 1: It's like apps like that have been around 10-plus years that let you just move one mouse one keyboard one computer and control several Computers over the network.

390
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's old technology.

391
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:31,520
Speaker 0: What Apple brings adding table is if you got all Apple devices it all came.

392
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Speaker 1: Of course, it's only gonna work with all Apple devices.

393
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,137
Speaker 0: But the fact that it kind of just works is I think it does just.

394
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:37,680
Speaker 1: that is true.

395
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,272
Speaker 1: They mean that's you know, they do, you know, the they do it better right?

396
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:47,305
Speaker 1: The iPod was better than the existing mp3 players at the time They invented the mp3 player it's like.

397
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:47,667
Speaker 1: no you didn't.

398
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:55,540
Speaker 0: Penny arcade said you can buy an iPod or you could buy one of those ones.

399
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,042
Speaker 0: That's just red.

400
00:30:56,102 --> 00:31:01,578
Speaker 0: mp3 is off of a CD R and cushion it with several hundred dollars in cash exactly.

401
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,209
Speaker 1: So You know stuff like stuff along that those lines.

402
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,400
Speaker 1: right, you know, yeah, they reinvented a wheel and you know, whatever.

403
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:17,032
Speaker 0: They did announce one thing FaceTime is coming to Android in Windows, but back that off a little bit.

404
00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:20,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's coming to the web All right.

405
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:25,789
Speaker 1: So what they're doing is You know FaceTime when they announced FaceTime originally.

406
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:30,020
Speaker 1: you can watch that keynote, you know, Steve Jobs is like this is gonna be open source.

407
00:31:30,301 --> 00:31:31,826
Speaker 1: Right, we're gonna make it an open protocol.

408
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:34,275
Speaker 1: So anyone can make face-to-eye message like open.

409
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:35,760
Speaker 1: that was ended up being a bunch of bullshit.

410
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:37,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did not to do that.

411
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:45,577
Speaker 1: And in fact during the epic case They discussed well, you know, they were revealed Discussions about why they ended up not doing that.

412
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:50,440
Speaker 1: Because they thought it would make it too easy for people to switch over to Android phones.

413
00:31:50,882 --> 00:31:53,859
Speaker 1: Right because they wanted I messaged to sort of keep people on iOS.

414
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:57,274
Speaker 1: I think that they government should force them to.

415
00:31:57,495 --> 00:32:00,232
Speaker 1: you know, yeah You said you were gonna do it false advertising.

416
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,359
Speaker 1: so you have to do it now too bad?

417
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:06,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, but there's all these little minor updates like that that I don't think will materially change.

418
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:07,042
Speaker 0: but what

419
00:32:07,062 --> 00:32:26,880
Speaker 1: they did do what they did do is be they added a feature to FaceTime where you can you know schedule a FaceTime and then get a URL link to the FaceTime and send it to everyone so that they can click on it at the right time to join the FaceTime which is you know standard functionality for video chat they didn't have because theirs is more of a phone thing, right?

420
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,857
Speaker 1: You'd like start a call right, you know.

421
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:34,320
Speaker 1: And now but you can send those links to somebody, you know, who isn't using their iPhone.

422
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:39,640
Speaker 1: Just open it in their computer right and join the FaceTime on you know, the web web browser.

423
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,740
Speaker 0: I don't think this will make FaceTime a viable zoom competitor at any point.

424
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:45,345
Speaker 1: I don't think it will either.

425
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:49,540
Speaker 1: but I do think that there will be times where like someone will you know?

426
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,547
Speaker 1: Someone who's like a big Apple person right will start a FaceTime and you might end up getting a link to one You know once.

427
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:58,126
Speaker 0: if you're not once in a while I will say I've pretty much like.

428
00:32:58,146 --> 00:33:02,385
Speaker 0: zoom has gotten a lot better to the point that I do use it now and I do Trust its security enough.

429
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,675
Speaker 0: I pretty much use zoom and discord for that.

430
00:33:04,695 --> 00:33:06,806
Speaker 1: I Have zoom on the work computer.

431
00:33:06,847 --> 00:33:08,376
Speaker 1: I don't need it on my regular computer.

432
00:33:08,457 --> 00:33:09,547
Speaker 1: Yeah I need to be in.

433
00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:13,037
Speaker 1: What zooms do I need to be in?

434
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,025
Speaker 0: Zooms for a couple of.

435
00:33:16,106 --> 00:33:16,547
Speaker 0: it's funny.

436
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:17,691
Speaker 0: There's a couple of discord servers.

437
00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:19,939
Speaker 0: I made well, they'll have links to the zoom calls.

438
00:33:21,341 --> 00:33:22,565
Speaker 1: You're in a discord you have a disc.

439
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:26,479
Speaker 0: No zoom has a lot of things that are useful that discord doesn't have.

440
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,384
Speaker 1: That's surprising.

441
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:31,078
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if I'm if I'm any one of these companies, right?

442
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:31,580
Speaker 1: He was working.

443
00:33:32,902 --> 00:33:36,840
Speaker 0: Just be a giant like arbors of them just eating each other's features, right?

444
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:44,919
Speaker 0: It's like if I worked at discord or zoom or Google or Apple or I'd have someone who's old job was to use the competitors And tell me about the cool things they do.

445
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:49,040
Speaker 1: I Would be literally like just open up all the other ones and copy all their features.

446
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,886
Speaker 0: Every feature Does breakout rooms.

447
00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:54,312
Speaker 0: the way zoom does their zooms break?

448
00:33:54,352 --> 00:33:54,955
Speaker 1: I don't just score.

449
00:33:54,975 --> 00:33:56,000
Speaker 1: does any breakout rooms?

450
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,868
Speaker 1: It's like I'd be like I'd be on like.

451
00:33:58,088 --> 00:34:00,779
Speaker 1: hey, they have breakout rooms and we don't do it do it now.

452
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:02,450
Speaker 1: We need that.

453
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:05,542
Speaker 1: Anyway, what are?

454
00:34:05,563 --> 00:34:07,208
Speaker 1: the one thing that Apple announced?

455
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:13,630
Speaker 1: that was big for me, but I'm they didn't say too much about it and I'm cautious but at least it's it's.

456
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:15,559
Speaker 1: I've been asking for it for a long time.

457
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:20,060
Speaker 1: is I want to be able to make an iPad or iPhone app on my iPad?

458
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,179
Speaker 1: I don't want it to buy a fucking Mac to do it, right?

459
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,925
Speaker 1: So I wanted Xcode for iPad.

460
00:34:24,427 --> 00:34:25,409
Speaker 1: that does not exist.

461
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:31,819
Speaker 1: They're all that exists for you know is They have this like what's it called like Swift?

462
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:33,661
Speaker 1: Playground.

463
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:41,420
Speaker 1: it's like a little app for iPad and iPhone that where you can learn the Swift programming language Right like tutorials and stuff and like if you're that always.

464
00:34:42,223 --> 00:34:49,719
Speaker 0: Swift is also the name of the global Transaction and like payments network and protocol its name of the iOS programming.

465
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:52,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know but it's also the name of the thing that I work with a lot professionally.

466
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:56,690
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is they are adding the ability.

467
00:34:56,951 --> 00:35:00,360
Speaker 1: not there aren't making Xcode for iOS or iPad OS.

468
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:05,632
Speaker 1: They are making the Swift playground app is going to have the ability to.

469
00:35:05,752 --> 00:35:15,468
Speaker 1: all they said was that you'll be able to make an iPad app an iPhone app and get it in the App Store Using just your iPad only and not anything else.

470
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:17,986
Speaker 1: so that's Basically what I wanted.

471
00:35:18,588 --> 00:35:23,591
Speaker 1: the only question I have is it seems like you know It's part of the Swift playground tutorial.

472
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:28,040
Speaker 1: kind of deal right babies first It might be only babies first.

473
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:32,120
Speaker 1: Will you actually be able to make an app using any of the iOS?

474
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,539
Speaker 1: Apis that are all you know the huge pile of them, right?

475
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:48,500
Speaker 0: In the right direction even it is minimal because I'm absolutely gonna be making iOS iPadOS apps because the old man thing that we are both like insistent on like something the kids cannot let like fail.

476
00:35:49,343 --> 00:35:54,020
Speaker 0: The devices people use have to be capable of making software to use on set devices.

477
00:35:54,724 --> 00:35:57,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, well that is really important to the future of computing.

478
00:35:58,842 --> 00:35:59,444
Speaker 1: It's happening.

479
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:00,067
Speaker 1: So that's good.

480
00:36:00,087 --> 00:36:05,284
Speaker 1: I just wonder it's like will you be able to make any Conceivable app using it out of wolf.

481
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:08,169
Speaker 1: We'll find out right, but that's good.

482
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:12,177
Speaker 1: They I Basically got half or most of my request.

483
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:14,103
Speaker 1: I guess that I've been requesting for several years.

484
00:36:14,143 --> 00:36:16,490
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna complain about that, right?

485
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,980
Speaker 1: They seem to be pushing there.

486
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,243
Speaker 1: I don't know.

487
00:36:19,283 --> 00:36:19,930
Speaker 1: and other stuff.

488
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:29,610
Speaker 1: They seem to be pushing their home stuff a bit more, you know in terms of like, you know Watching things on every screen, you know, you can now airplay to a Mac, right?

489
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:32,750
Speaker 1: So if you got like an iMac is your TV in your room?

490
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:37,929
Speaker 1: You can you know have your iPhone and say hey display this on the Mac instead of just Apple TV.

491
00:36:38,836 --> 00:36:40,349
Speaker 1: You know things of that nature.

492
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,618
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's didn't sure.

493
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,410
Speaker 1: all this stuff is gonna be coming down the line.

494
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:45,374
Speaker 1: You know.

495
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:55,935
Speaker 1: when iOS gets updated in September October and they'll probably have Even more announcements and the new iPhones and the new Apple watch and the new iPad will have you know Some of those features.

496
00:36:56,035 --> 00:37:06,750
Speaker 0: I'm keeping an eye out because as much as I'm deep in the Android ecosystem It's either the next Sony's Android phones are gonna be tiny or I'm just gonna fucking give up and I have to give I have to give up.

497
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,236
Speaker 0: I'll probably just jump shit.

498
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:11,770
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see if the tiny I've owned, you know, see if they make it.

499
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,413
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

500
00:37:12,473 --> 00:37:22,809
Speaker 0: It's gonna come down to the smallest newest iPhone Versus the smallest like worthwhile Android phone, whichever one's smaller is where I'm going.

501
00:37:23,513 --> 00:37:24,723
Speaker 1: Well, see how they go.

502
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:25,550
Speaker 0: Who knows?

503
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,708
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

504
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:40,104
Speaker 0: so way back a while back like not even that long ago Scott had a thing of the day.

505
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:52,695
Speaker 0: There was this channel that was like Soviet old Soviet cartoons without context and my thing of the day is a Soviet cartoon on a Twitter account called Soviet cartoons.

506
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:58,573
Speaker 0: out of context Apparently the account Scott linked to which was this thing of the day is gone.

507
00:37:59,055 --> 00:38:03,440
Speaker 0: This is a completely unrelated account But I'm not linking to the account.

508
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,360
Speaker 0: I'm actually looking to a specific video because it's only a minute and 26 seconds long.

509
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,345
Speaker 0: You have to watch it.

510
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:11,339
Speaker 0: It's as long as an anime opener and you never skip those.

511
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:16,070
Speaker 0: It is a Soviet cartoon about a rocket launch.

512
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,373
Speaker 0: It is called lift five.

513
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:18,296
Speaker 0: It's a satellite launch.

514
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:22,383
Speaker 0: It's called lift five and Halfway through it.

515
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:27,820
Speaker 0: You'll realize what the joke was and then at the end you'll see the final punchline.

516
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:30,109
Speaker 0: This thing is hilarious.

517
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:31,115
Speaker 0: It is perfect.

518
00:38:31,316 --> 00:38:31,799
Speaker 0: I love it.

519
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:38,436
Speaker 0: It's got such a good style and also I particularly appreciate the soundtrack.

520
00:38:39,037 --> 00:38:40,000
Speaker 0: the song is great.

521
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:43,799
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't know what else I can say about this thing like just watch it.

522
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,230
Speaker 1: So something I sort of knew.

523
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:52,947
Speaker 1: but didn't you know, it took me as a shy Shockingly long time to realize this.

524
00:38:53,027 --> 00:38:55,514
Speaker 1: right but you know, you got some old DOS computer.

525
00:38:55,614 --> 00:38:57,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, you turn that shit on.

526
00:38:57,822 --> 00:39:00,180
Speaker 1: Let's say you take out all the hard drives and you turn that shit on.

527
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:06,620
Speaker 1: First of all, right it posts and on the screen when it's posting is text like it's counting up the RAM and stuff, right?

528
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then when it's done, it's if there's no discs.

529
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,119
Speaker 1: It's gonna say no system disk or disk error on the screen.

530
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:15,464
Speaker 1: Yeah so That's I mean your.

531
00:39:15,905 --> 00:39:17,733
Speaker 1: your current PC will probably do the same fucking thing.

532
00:39:17,793 --> 00:39:19,280
Speaker 0: if yeah, it's not.

533
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,748
Speaker 0: It's all different but same same concept.

534
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:25,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's UEFI whatever but there's no hard drives in there.

535
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:30,959
Speaker 1: Oh How is it, you know, it's writing text on the screen.

536
00:39:31,824 --> 00:39:34,219
Speaker 1: Where where is that font coming from?

537
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:42,240
Speaker 1: it's like You know, it's like you're going to you get a computer and it has no software no operating system, but it can display text.

538
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:45,230
Speaker 1: It's like is that is the BIOS have a font in it?

539
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:47,820
Speaker 1: It's like actually yes sort of it does.

540
00:39:48,982 --> 00:39:52,540
Speaker 1: If you ever use DOS, it's like, you know, you don't have fonts in DOS.

541
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:55,070
Speaker 1: It's like there's just the one font that you have.

542
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,214
Speaker 1: you love a DOS computer.

543
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:56,515
Speaker 1: It's just.

544
00:39:56,535 --> 00:39:57,218
Speaker 1: there's the one font.

545
00:39:57,258 --> 00:40:00,932
Speaker 1: That's it Alright, it's like where the fuck does that little ASCII font come from?

546
00:40:01,655 --> 00:40:02,518
Speaker 1: It's actually.

547
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:03,060
Speaker 1: where is it?

548
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,286
Speaker 1: It's in your VGA ROM on your video card.

549
00:40:05,928 --> 00:40:08,696
Speaker 1: right in the in the ROM on the video card.

550
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:10,120
Speaker 1: There is a font in there.

551
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:16,397
Speaker 1: It's it's a low-res pixel, you know VGA font and pretty much every video cards got one.

552
00:40:16,918 --> 00:40:25,440
Speaker 1: So this dude He had a few different, you know He's apparently someone who really loves DOS and DOS programming even still to this to this day.

553
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,238
Speaker 0: I can feel that because I've read the I was about to say man page.

554
00:40:29,298 --> 00:40:29,720
Speaker 0: It's not the man.

555
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,200
Speaker 0: I read the documentation of mem maker yesterday just kind of random.

556
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:41,618
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's a person who loves DOS and doing DOS things is still apparently programming Pascal stuff on DOS, right?

557
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:49,318
Speaker 1: So But they apparently had old video cards for DOS and like ISA ones and those ones.

558
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:52,632
Speaker 1: He really liked the fonts in those ones, right?

559
00:40:53,174 --> 00:41:03,670
Speaker 1: But he got a newer one a sang labs W32 I with two megabytes of RAM And apparently this is like an amazing DOS video card.

560
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,193
Speaker 1: It can even play quake at 320 by 200.

561
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:19,520
Speaker 1: Whoa All right, like a really good DOS video card but Really kind of meh font right meh fonts not not nice like the fonts II they had on their previous video cards.

562
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,049
Speaker 1: So they got this tool and you the.

563
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,976
Speaker 1: the tool is called fontraption.

564
00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:24,698
Speaker 1: You can just get it.

565
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:45,320
Speaker 1: It's a this website whatever the link to fontraption is in this article and to basically Manually edit the font that was on the new video card right and overwrite the ROM Right with the new font in place of the old font Because you know taking up the same amount of memory.

566
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,508
Speaker 0: I love just the first line of the of the the essay section.

567
00:41:48,628 --> 00:41:52,338
Speaker 0: quote VGA ROM fonts cannot be replaced.

568
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:52,980
Speaker 0: that easy.

569
00:41:53,922 --> 00:41:59,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, so sort of an epic story about Replacing the font and a new video card with the font from an older video card.

570
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,916
Speaker 1: Also, these fonts are totally my style.

571
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:03,680
Speaker 1: I love these fonts.

572
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,844
Speaker 1: I wish I you know could.

573
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:09,480
Speaker 1: I'm always looking for a font that looks like this just to use in vim.

574
00:42:10,043 --> 00:42:13,139
Speaker 1: But the problem, you know, I guess fixed sys in Windows comes close.

575
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:15,268
Speaker 1: But the problem is that you can't.

576
00:42:15,328 --> 00:42:18,560
Speaker 1: it's not realistic because they don't have enough characters right for the modern day.

577
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,632
Speaker 1: We have a code right there ASCII fonts there.

578
00:42:20,712 --> 00:42:21,959
Speaker 1: You can't use them anymore, right?

579
00:42:23,483 --> 00:42:25,296
Speaker 1: But I just you know, I do like how they look.

580
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:32,340
Speaker 1: so Yeah, you can learn about VGA fonts Which I also learned about from this awesome story.

581
00:42:32,561 --> 00:42:35,448
Speaker 0: Yeah in the meta moment, uh, we're hanging out.

582
00:42:35,508 --> 00:42:49,860
Speaker 0: The next convention will be at will be packs online or pecs east online 2021 where we were doing at least one panel We're doing a. we did a panel a long long time ago called Atari game design where we played a bunch of Atari games.

583
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,359
Speaker 0: It's like talked about the game design live on stage while we played them.

584
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:58,680
Speaker 0: We're gonna do a completely updated version of that and actually focus on a bunch of single-player games instead of just multiplayer games.

585
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:00,939
Speaker 0: I think it'll be fun.

586
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,537
Speaker 0: We may or may not do an additional panel or two, but stay tuned.

587
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:09,695
Speaker 0: also Looks like the theme of this pecs east online is gonna be like a summer camp theme.

588
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:18,060
Speaker 0: So we I Want to do something with that theme, but we'll see if we actually have the energy to do something with that theme.

589
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:23,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever you were the one sending me like Amazon links to fake fire.

590
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:24,020
Speaker 0: We could buy.

591
00:43:24,862 --> 00:43:25,183
Speaker 1: That was.

592
00:43:25,204 --> 00:43:25,887
Speaker 1: it was your idea.

593
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:27,335
Speaker 1: I was just showing you that it was out there.

594
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is out there.

595
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:28,797
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

596
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,437
Speaker 0: Otherwise the book club book is still the tale of Genji.

597
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:34,092
Speaker 0: Read it a little bit now that it's warm out.

598
00:43:34,172 --> 00:43:35,700
Speaker 0: I can just sit in the warmth and right.

599
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:36,163
Speaker 1: I biked.

600
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:37,614
Speaker 1: I biked too far and didn't read.

601
00:43:37,635 --> 00:43:43,340
Speaker 0: Yep I thought the problem is I thought cuz we biked to Poughkeepsie and I took the train home and I thought all right.

602
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,669
Speaker 1: So I got a read on that train.

603
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:46,080
Speaker 0: I thought it's two-hour train ride.

604
00:43:46,721 --> 00:43:48,810
Speaker 0: I'll read for like the first hour and then I'll fall asleep.

605
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:51,060
Speaker 0: and I had just biked a hundred and two miles.

606
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:54,500
Speaker 0: I got on the train and I immediately fell asleep and I woke up at Grand Central.

607
00:43:55,863 --> 00:43:56,776
Speaker 0: Well, that was that.

608
00:43:56,796 --> 00:44:07,924
Speaker 0: uh Otherwise just keep on keep it on follow CDC guidelines and Most likely the next convention you'll see us in person at The moat.

609
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:10,236
Speaker 0: the one that's most likely is packs unplugged.

610
00:44:10,457 --> 00:44:12,383
Speaker 0: in November We'll see.

611
00:44:12,604 --> 00:44:13,326
Speaker 1: maybe I hope so.

612
00:44:13,427 --> 00:44:16,560
Speaker 0: I said most likely that's that's the one that has the highest chance of success.

613
00:44:16,861 --> 00:44:23,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think my you know, I think rim said the same thing is like, you know, my policy is basically like look, right?

614
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:37,510
Speaker 1: Would you get on a plane if they said all right everyone on this plane, you know Just in case we're gonna make you all wear a parachute the whole time or you're gonna get in a boat they're like gonna make you wear a life preserver the whole time just in case it's like.

615
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:47,471
Speaker 1: I mean shouldn't the plane be safe enough that like not all the passengers need parachutes at all times Like, you know, maybe like under the seat or something, right?

616
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:49,296
Speaker 1: But like just you have to wear it the whole time.

617
00:44:49,357 --> 00:44:50,420
Speaker 1: Is that risky?

618
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:56,020
Speaker 1: Right, so it's like if you're gonna have a convention and you're gonna say that I have to wear a mask the whole time.

619
00:44:56,081 --> 00:45:06,319
Speaker 1: Well then in that case You're basically admitting that the convention itself is risky And therefore we need to take precautions the whole time in which case I'm not gonna go to that because it's risky.

620
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:08,087
Speaker 1: I also could be.

621
00:45:08,388 --> 00:45:15,375
Speaker 1: the convention itself has to be safe enough Fundamentally at its core that I do not need to wear a mask the whole time.

622
00:45:15,455 --> 00:45:21,347
Speaker 1: I am there right For me to be willing to go to it now Even if you're not afraid of all that.

623
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:24,740
Speaker 0: there is a much more selfish reason not to go to a con like that.

624
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:28,420
Speaker 0: It's one thing like people who have to work like during this you wear.

625
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:37,218
Speaker 0: you might wear a mask for eight hours with a break at lunch, but Imagine going to a con like packs and having to wear a mask the entire time from 9 a.m.

626
00:45:38,621 --> 00:45:39,203
Speaker 1: Midnight, I don't.

627
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:40,067
Speaker 1: I don't buy that Matt.

628
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:42,257
Speaker 1: wearing a mask is no great discomfort, right?

629
00:45:42,317 --> 00:45:42,880
Speaker 1: That's you know.

630
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,895
Speaker 1: You're basically Get a better mask.

631
00:45:46,915 --> 00:45:50,751
Speaker 0: that doesn't do that Even with seals I just what.

632
00:45:50,771 --> 00:45:54,192
Speaker 0: but more importantly that would be Uncomfortable, you know, I can't just like drink.

633
00:45:54,715 --> 00:45:58,160
Speaker 1: while you're sitting in there You sound you sound like the Trumpy people like I don't want our mayor.

634
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:01,126
Speaker 0: They still have to require masks.

635
00:46:01,527 --> 00:46:07,608
Speaker 0: Just don't go to any event that requires masks because if it's a mass event like that It's probably not safe to go to in the first place.

636
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:08,773
Speaker 1: I just disagree.

637
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:10,863
Speaker 1: the mass are uncomfortable in any way It's not.

638
00:46:10,923 --> 00:46:12,799
Speaker 1: it's no inconvenience to wear one.

639
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:21,647
Speaker 1: But my only my only reason is I still if it's if it's so unsafe that one is required Then it's so unsafe that I'm not gonna go.

640
00:46:21,868 --> 00:46:26,621
Speaker 0: I'm saying I would find it very uncomfortable to wear a mask for 14.

641
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:28,600
Speaker 1: The mass courtroom is face fucked up.

642
00:46:29,342 --> 00:46:31,208
Speaker 0: But I'll wear them while it's necessary.

643
00:46:31,248 --> 00:46:31,829
Speaker 0: But you know what?

644
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:34,758
Speaker 0: I won't do put myself in a situation unnecessarily.

645
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:35,480
Speaker 0: where it's necessary.

646
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:43,576
Speaker 0: I would not go to any convention that required masks at any point because like you said if the convention requires masks It's not safe enough.

647
00:46:44,546 --> 00:46:46,300
Speaker 0: That's right and Otacon is happening.

648
00:46:46,483 --> 00:46:54,260
Speaker 1: If it's not if it's not yeah If it's not so if the situation is not such that we can just safely have a no mass convention Then it's not safe enough for us to have a convention.

649
00:46:54,461 --> 00:47:00,398
Speaker 0: So Otacon is going forward with the in-person con in August beginning of August going to that.

650
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:03,849
Speaker 0: they're requiring Masks for all attendees for the entire time.

651
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:07,060
Speaker 0: They're in the convention center and there would be designated areas for eating.

652
00:47:07,221 --> 00:47:09,239
Speaker 0: So I'm not going anywhere near that.

653
00:47:10,145 --> 00:47:11,874
Speaker 1: Nope, I don't recommend anyone else.

654
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:12,478
Speaker 1: go to that either.

655
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:14,820
Speaker 0: Alright.

656
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:19,216
Speaker 0: so, uh, we ended up talking a lot about news.

657
00:47:19,377 --> 00:47:25,146
Speaker 0: the show is 51 minutes long already Even accounting for the thing.

658
00:47:26,008 --> 00:47:26,530
Speaker 1: what happened?

659
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:26,971
Speaker 0: We did.

660
00:47:27,232 --> 00:47:29,138
Speaker 0: we did a tech news roundup by accident.

661
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:32,598
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I feel like we should save UX for a different Monday.

662
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:34,123
Speaker 1: No, you're cheating.

663
00:47:34,344 --> 00:47:40,566
Speaker 0: It's either that or hey, I tried to get you to shut up and you kept talking about Apple But I didn't talk about that long.

664
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:41,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, you did.

665
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,313
Speaker 0: I have the matters.

666
00:47:42,353 --> 00:47:44,120
Speaker 0: I put a marker in the metadata for every topic.

667
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,451
Speaker 1: It's not cuz the phone sure it isn't cuz the door rang.

668
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:53,360
Speaker 0: the door ringing removed a grand total of.

669
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:56,808
Speaker 0: So I can select this right now just trying to bail.

670
00:47:56,988 --> 00:47:57,650
Speaker 1: you should have bail.

671
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:58,152
Speaker 1: mid show.

672
00:47:58,232 --> 00:48:00,580
Speaker 0: two minutes and 30 seconds was removed.

673
00:48:00,803 --> 00:48:04,960
Speaker 0: We have currently recorded 55 minutes before we stopped just now.

674
00:48:07,122 --> 00:48:14,056
Speaker 0: So do you want to go for 40 minutes 30 minutes talk about UX design for five minutes and call it a day.

675
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,688
Speaker 1: I Guess I have to eat food and it's almost seven.

676
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:20,739
Speaker 0: I guess we accidentally did a tech news roundup through no fault of my own.

677
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:22,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, you cheated.

678
00:48:24,981 --> 00:48:26,675
Speaker 1: Okay, you can't do a tech news around him next year.

679
00:48:26,756 --> 00:48:27,220
Speaker 1: you lost it.

680
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,823
Speaker 1: I'm just saying if we uh, if you go back to the audio, that's it March March 2022 No tech news.

681
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:38,044
Speaker 0: There are numerous points where you hear me try to be like, okay Let let's can we?

682
00:48:38,264 --> 00:48:40,791
Speaker 0: we should know at and you Scott just kept going.

683
00:48:41,513 --> 00:48:41,734
Speaker 1: No.

684
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:44,080
Speaker 1: All right, 2023 is the next tech news around.

685
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:46,490
Speaker 1: You lost these petty or you got it.

686
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:48,040
Speaker 0: You feel like this might happen again.

687
00:48:49,022 --> 00:48:51,638
Speaker 1: You got a loan you took a loan out and now you're in debt.

688

698
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:05,940
Speaker 0: the news couldn't get Scott to shut up, so I snuck in another tech news roundup.

699
00:50:06,321 --> 00:50:21,856
Speaker 0: You are welcome to give feedback in the geek nights forum or perhaps the geek nights discord Reminding Scott that the tech news roundup format is actually very popular and that perhaps Monday episodes Would be easier to do if we just did this on a monthly basis, but I digress anyway.

700
00:50:21,876 --> 00:50:23,140
Speaker 0: enjoy your summer.
