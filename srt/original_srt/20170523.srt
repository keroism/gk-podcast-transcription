1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,272
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, May 23rd, 2017.

2
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:12,753
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:15,260
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,439
Speaker 1: Tumble seed the sequel to ice-cold beer.

5
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:21,416
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:31,108
Speaker 1: So yeah, there were no shows last week cuz I was in Hong Kong, but if you followed Scott on YouTube There's a bunch of Scott stuff going on.

7
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,016
Speaker 1: was there you were streaming and stuff.

8
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:33,820
Speaker 1: I saw notifications.

9
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:36,513
Speaker 0: I guess maybe I think I did less than I plan to do.

10
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:37,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, you did some.

11
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:40,250
Speaker 1: Hi, I thought I did more than you did.

12
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:44,324
Speaker 1: Well, I thought I'd do some podcast while I was in Hong Kong But I was just too busy.

13
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:48,035
Speaker 1: I also mean tired because it's 12 hours off.

14
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:53,069
Speaker 0: I also made an appearance on ATW 9k, which I thought didn't exist anymore.

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,796
Speaker 0: But no, I just stopped listening to the podcast.

16
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:55,700
Speaker 0: It totally still exists.

17
00:00:55,821 --> 00:01:00,301
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only podcast I actually listened to is pseudopod and occasionally 538.

18
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:02,249
Speaker 1: I don't really listen to anything else anymore.

19
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:04,620
Speaker 1: I actually haven't even listened to Dave and Joel in a while.

20
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:09,060
Speaker 1: I haven't listened to that in years, but Hong Kong was a fun.

21
00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:17,089
Speaker 1: But also I didn't really get to do anything cool because I was just working and I'm getting to two conventions Back to back days and then I flew home.

22
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:20,904
Speaker 0: Why were there two conventions at the same time - So they're too fast.

23
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:22,511
Speaker 0: I seized anime Boston situation.

24
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:24,359
Speaker 1: So yeah, you know what tends to happen in finance.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,495
Speaker 1: There'll be a big conference like in Hong Kong or Singapore or something.

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,620
Speaker 1: So clever people will that same week book another venue in the area and do their own conference and piggyback off of it.

27
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,909
Speaker 0: Well, but why would people go to your thing instead of the big thing?

28
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,309
Speaker 1: People don't go there for just one thing They'll just go to both.

29
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:43,105
Speaker 1: Mmm They're only one day things.

30
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:49,612
Speaker 1: these things are the only ones that are multi-day are like trade tech Paris Which I went to once so that the big thing is Saturday.

31
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:50,536
Speaker 0: You make your thing Sunday.

32
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:51,400
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

33
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:53,680
Speaker 1: So the big thing was like Thursday.

34
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:57,313
Speaker 1: So Thompson did a thing on Wednesday and I was there all week.

35
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,200
Speaker 1: So I had to do both Thompson like Thompson Reuters.

36
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:00,127
Speaker 0: Yep, okay.

37
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:01,920
Speaker 1: They were there at a conference the same company.

38
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,706
Speaker 1: They ran a conference for the buys.

39
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:04,409
Speaker 1: people just calm.

40
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:06,074
Speaker 1: people call them Thompson or TR.

41
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:19,052
Speaker 1: I Try to avoid using the the jargon of finance because I'm sure you guys really care about that stuff, but People seem to care about shit just because they can't help themselves.

42
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:21,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like once they hear a thing exists.

43
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,707
Speaker 0: They need to know everything there is about.

44
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:23,975
Speaker 1: you know, part of that is it's like.

45
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:30,034
Speaker 1: it's like, you know If you don't know anything about cars at all But you're near a mechanic and they open the hood and start poking around.

46
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:30,777
Speaker 1: you got to lean over.

47
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:36,884
Speaker 0: you want to see like hey If you're that's how you tell a good person from a bad person whether or not they lean over there and look if they have a Curious mind.

48
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:40,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have a desire for knowledge or they anti intellectual.

49
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,620
Speaker 0: If we just got rid of all the anti intellectual DNA, it would be a great world.

50
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:48,253
Speaker 1: Oh get rid of all the anti intellectual DNA.

51
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:49,600
Speaker 1: I wonder how that could be accomplished.

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,282
Speaker 1: I wonder if there's.

53
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:54,577
Speaker 1: I wonder if there's any problem with this potential theory that you've got.

54
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:55,460
Speaker 1: I don't know this.

55
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:05,209
Speaker 0: I Everyone else who's tried to do this has always used some wrong factor for deciding who to get rid of like You know skin color or something, right?

56
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,096
Speaker 0: If I use I could use.

57
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,172
Speaker 1: I'm following you down this road But at a distance right if we could.

58
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:10,615
Speaker 0: just you know.

59
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,705
Speaker 0: Let Scott choose who to get rid of Scottocracy.

60
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:19,048
Speaker 0: and you know, I'm not even gonna murder people We're just gonna send all the dumb people into space space.

61
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:20,091
Speaker 1: what like to be?

62
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:25,869
Speaker 0: or arc or send all the smart people into space I think smart and leave the dumb people here.

63
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:26,773
Speaker 1: You know what that is.

64
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:27,938
Speaker 1: That's the plot of Gundam seed.

65
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,450
Speaker 0: Yeah We'll have awesome robots and they'll have really shitty ones.

66
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:36,939
Speaker 1: cuz frankly like in that show even though you know The coordinators kind of also want to genocide the humans back.

67
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:41,260
Speaker 1: It's easy to pick a side in that fight because the ones are pretty much the worst.

68
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,383
Speaker 0: Well, do you know?

69
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:47,577
Speaker 0: and the other thing is the humans only stood a chance because they stole the freedom Gundam.

70
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:48,359
Speaker 0: They didn't make that.

71
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:50,604
Speaker 0: They didn't make the.

72
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:54,996
Speaker 1: well, they also outbred the space people because the space people stopped having babies.

73
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:56,339
Speaker 0: they were too smart.

74
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,658
Speaker 0: they Smart enough to not make babies.

75
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,487
Speaker 1: Except no, it wasn't it that they were.

76
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:07,634
Speaker 1: they became infertile because of the genetic stuff They did and they basically broke their deal like they broke their genetics.

77
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:12,374
Speaker 1: Whatever don't make space babies Yeah, or if you're gonna make space babies expect them to replace you.

78
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:13,740
Speaker 0: your space babies are robots.

79
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:15,900
Speaker 1: So in some minor news, they got a minor geek bite.

80
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:27,540
Speaker 1: I think we mentioned this but race for the galaxy, which is a pretty good Light tabletop game been around for quite some time We played the hell out of it and kind of stopped playing it just because we played it a lot.

81
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:30,095
Speaker 1: I never played it enough to get good at it, but I played it.

82
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:30,960
Speaker 0: It was good play.

83
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,700
Speaker 0: What there's a PC app that was free.

84
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,747
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's still around but I played that a whole bunch for like a few weeks at one time Yeah, and then I was like, alright, it's enough of that.

85
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:42,560
Speaker 1: So, uh an Android and iPhone app came out.

86
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:47,542
Speaker 1: Yeah, official and not only is it official but it is Fantastic.

87
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:50,433
Speaker 0: This is the kind of game you need an app for because it has.

88
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:55,500
Speaker 0: if you've never played it a lot Then you have problems like figuring out what the symbols mean and stuff like that.

89
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:09,880
Speaker 1: and now the thing is if you know the game like the iconography and of the game is Fantastic, like it's really well designed but the learning curve for people who are not freaks like us is Shockingly steep right like what the hell does that fucking symbol mean?

90
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,059
Speaker 1: And they make sense in retrospect.

91
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:26,003
Speaker 1: But it's also this this game is like the poster child for the bit in our panel on writing game rules about how one Of the best ways for people to learn a game is to have someone else just run the game for them and provide the bumpers Like provide the rails.

92
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:31,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think we I'm assuming we reviewed race to the galaxy at some point on geek nights.

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,463
Speaker 0: I'm not that.

94
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:34,990
Speaker 1: maybe if we didn't that's an easy Tuesday show.

95
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:43,595
Speaker 1: Okay, but what I will say is that I Think anyone who listens to geek nights should just buy this app because it is it is.

96
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:45,200
Speaker 0: how many dollars is it?

97
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,083
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

98
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:47,509
Speaker 0: I just buy it free.

99
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,333
Speaker 1: It's not free.

100
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:50,020
Speaker 0: It doesn't come with all the expansions you want.

101
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,207
Speaker 1: It comes with the first expansion.

102
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,752
Speaker 1: I think the other two are not out yet.

103
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:54,976
Speaker 0: Mmm.

104
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:56,180
Speaker 0: They're gonna charge you for that shit.

105
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,104
Speaker 1: I don't care.

106
00:05:57,446 --> 00:05:59,093
Speaker 1: all told it'll be less than 20 bucks.

107
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:02,374
Speaker 0: with like every expansion ever I'm pretty sure you could just buy all those for 20 bucks.

108
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:09,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I cannot play the physical ones by myself while I'm pooping in a public bath, I think I can.

109
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:11,800
Speaker 1: It's gonna be a Ukraine.

110
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:32,700
Speaker 1: But the real notable thing about this is that I've played a lot of these apps of tabletop games and a lot of them are real bad or They're pretty good, but their UX has a lot of failings.

111
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,751
Speaker 0: No, this is I mean the teeny ones 90% good.

112
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,960
Speaker 0: the patchwork one is way good.

113
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the carcass own one is a car.

114
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,494
Speaker 0: This one's real good.

115
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:42,177
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

116
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:42,920
Speaker 1: It's got a few issues.

117
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:49,217
Speaker 0: It's not issues in that it like it requires you to do more presses than you would like to have to press.

118
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,782
Speaker 0: but but there's a Lot of shortcuts.

119
00:06:50,802 --> 00:06:52,065
Speaker 0: you can skip over some presses.

120
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:57,680
Speaker 1: What impresses me about the race for the galaxy UX is that this is the first big?

121
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:03,959
Speaker 1: Tabletop game I've tried to play on a phone since I got a super tiny phone with a tiny lower.

122
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,687
Speaker 0: it like 720p works on the tiniest screen.

123
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:13,660
Speaker 1: it works on a tiny screen so well that I was shocked I'd probably just playing at my giant iPad.

124
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:21,939
Speaker 1: But like the things it does UX wise to deal with the fact that my screen is so small that there is Literally no way to read those cards.

125
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:33,696
Speaker 1: It is just very well designed to the point that I actually want to track down who specifically did the UX And talk to them because it's impressive and I am deeply impressed by it.

126
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:36,090
Speaker 1: You should buy this if you live the geek nights.

127
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:38,180
Speaker 1: if you haven't played race for the galaxy guess what?

128
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:47,120
Speaker 1: You'll have way more fun learning it playing this app than having someone like me or Scott tried to teach it to you and trying To figure out the symbols and the stupid cards and then like you can't show anyone your hand.

129
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:48,052
Speaker 0: Yeah,

130
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:59,912
Speaker 1: also I think now that I've played this game Probably over a hundred times since I got the app because I had a bunch of long flights And you know I play it on the subway, and I play it when I poop I can crank out almost two full games during one poop.

131
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,020
Speaker 1: It's like wonder Ashima hex games worth of this.

132
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,034
Speaker 0: It's a real fast game.

133
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:10,686
Speaker 1: to play This card I think I've gotten to the point to where I gotta count cards And it's pretty much random who wins.

134
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:11,529
Speaker 0: add more expansions.

135
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:12,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've got.

136
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,637
Speaker 1: I've added every expansion.

137
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:16,045
Speaker 1: That's currently available But it's super good.

138
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:17,290
Speaker 1: He got any gaming news.

139
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,294
Speaker 0: What was my gaming news?

140
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,060
Speaker 0: They say we're gaming news was the alright.

141
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:24,980
Speaker 0: So check this out, so here's a check in a while ago in hearthstone, right?

142
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:35,392
Speaker 0: There's a mode standard where you can only use the newish cards Which is good because if you just start playing today, and you had to get every card ever even including the old cards How would you do that right?

143
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:36,240
Speaker 0: It'd be too many fun?

144
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,979
Speaker 0: I'd be like oh you want to start playing magic huh well every one of the stores got moxes what you can do about it.

145
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:46,840
Speaker 1: That was how it was playing magic before they started doing like draft tournaments, right?

146
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,639
Speaker 0: But anyway, so they have what's called wild which is where you can play any card in the history of hearthstone even one.

147
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,550
Speaker 0: And they don't even sell the old cards anymore.

148
00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:56,847
Speaker 0: like if a car is not in standard They don't sell it and she's got to have.

149
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:58,575
Speaker 0: you know you can make it with dust.

150
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:00,404
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I do so.

151
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:04,280
Speaker 0: you take your extra cards you disintegrate them, and you can make old cards with them.

152
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,685
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you haven't if you aren't if you're a new to hearthstone It's really hard to play wild.

153
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,780
Speaker 0: but anyway no one really played wild or gave a crap about it.

154
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:28,237
Speaker 0: But they announced like hey, we're gonna do a wild tournament and the people who are like top 64 in each region are gonna like qualify for this tournament of wild Standard I guess because hearthstone is a big enough game to where like you can make a living playing it.

155
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:41,900
Speaker 0: eSports wise People like invested a lot of fucking time to try to make sure they were in the top 64 at the end of the season In the wild category so that they could be in this tournament that they knew no other information about whatsoever.

156
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:49,589
Speaker 0: There was no information about the tournament other than basically like a few sentences like we're gonna do a tournament Top64 in each region.

157
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,518
Speaker 1: so considering that I didn't read this article I don't know about this.

158
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:57,298
Speaker 1: But the the title is how blizzard screwed people for the wild top 64 tournaments.

159
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:59,370
Speaker 1: I'm assuming this takes a dark turn.

160
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:11,328
Speaker 0: so there are some people who are in Australia Playing tar stone in the wild trying to try to get into this tournament because they wanted to be in because it you know they Felt like that was you know gonna be beneficial to their Esport career.

161
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:12,297
Speaker 0: right to be in this thing.

162
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:21,779
Speaker 1: So in Australia you know blizzard has regions right Asia Europe and North America Yep, which if you play like overwatch you just don't care like it doesn't affect you at all.

163
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you usually a lot of people have accounts on each region because remember hearthstone is free to play.

164
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:27,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

165
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,599
Speaker 0: So they'll have accounts on each region and some people like level up in each region every single month and shit like that.

166
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:44,060
Speaker 0: so These people are in Australia And if you're in Australia blizzard tells you for all their games that you should be in the North America region if you're in Australia.

167
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:52,777
Speaker 0: but For this tournament the tournament rules just came out suddenly You know after the whole thing was already said and done in terms of who are the top 64 were.

168
00:10:53,901 --> 00:11:01,828
Speaker 0: They put out the full tournament rules and the for the full tournament rules were like oh, yeah if you're in Australia You got to be in the Asia region to qualify.

169
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:05,500
Speaker 0: and they're like we would have made accounts in the Asia region and done it.

170
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:15,574
Speaker 1: But we only did it in North America because that's the region we're supposed to play in because it's extra interesting because like, you know I was just in Hong Kong the the acronym for that region is a pack.

171
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:17,360
Speaker 1: Yeah as in Asia Pacific.

172
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:29,338
Speaker 1: So I understand why they might have put Australia and New Zealand in North America But like there that is the right answer for 50% of use cases and the wrong answer for 50% of use cases.

173
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,756
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point is is that man they really screwed those people over even though I think it's not they're making a bigger deal out of it than it is.

174
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:40,027
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, it's like It's a silly tournament.

175
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,478
Speaker 0: It's a tournament for a children's card game, whatever.

176
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:46,310
Speaker 0: but The vast this keeps happening.

177
00:11:46,350 --> 00:12:12,737
Speaker 0: basically in all these sort of Competitives, you know, we've talked about it and other times that it's happened, but when there's competitive structures or organizations managing competitive tournaments for video games and also tabletop games and these organizations are not Top-tier right even companies that are big relatively big companies that have like departments that manage this shit, you know, like netrunner is fantasy fly.

178
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:19,434
Speaker 0: and You know like the League of Legends people valve screws shit up, right?

179
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:23,530
Speaker 0: They got like oh someone used a Cheat and a counter-strike thing.

180
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,460
Speaker 0: There was some something wrong with the map, right?

181
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:28,491
Speaker 1: But when was the last time the NHL screwed something up, right?

182
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:35,175
Speaker 0: It's like we see this kind of stuff Constantly when people have their organized play.

183
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,907
Speaker 0: their competitive play Departments are not good enough.

184
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:45,297
Speaker 0: They just keep fucking up and geek nights will always call them out up But just just like we do on everything.

185
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:45,619
Speaker 1: That's right.

186
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,640
Speaker 1: No, it's interesting cuz on one hand you might say like we said like well It's the hearthstone like it's not the most important or serious game.

187
00:12:52,141 --> 00:13:04,400
Speaker 1: But on the other hand as soon as you add a tournament structure or competitive play with prizes then supposedly big prizes Even if they're small prizes, you're suddenly saying yeah this this area of this game matters.

188
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,140
Speaker 1: You're basically telling everyone play this one for real play it seriously.

189
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:11,859
Speaker 1: So you're sort of telling all the players to like step up their game.

190
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:15,939
Speaker 1: But it's implied like there's a social contract that you also have to step up your game.

191
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:19,133
Speaker 1: No one's gonna treat quick play in overwatch.

192
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:22,606
Speaker 1: Seriously if they do They deserve what they get like.

193
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:28,572
Speaker 0: if you have something in the prize is like tens of thousands of dollars At least if it's if you're.

194
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:38,810
Speaker 0: even if you have a Competition and the prize for that competition is tens of thousands of dollars or more worth of stuff That means it's worth it to someone's like dedicate their life to it.

195
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,292
Speaker 0: Basically.

196
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:41,997
Speaker 0: No, that's like a year's salary for a lot of human beings.

197
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:43,744
Speaker 0: You know that's worth.

198
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:47,118
Speaker 0: someone quitting their job and spending all their time preparing to compete in that.

199
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:51,937
Speaker 0: now Right when you reach that level just thousands not enough but tens of thousands.

200
00:13:52,338 --> 00:14:05,689
Speaker 0: now As soon as you have a prize that is that amount you have to be 100% perfect in your competitive fairness and everything because people are dedicating their lives to possibly trying to win this thing I feel like with professional sports.

201
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:15,200
Speaker 1: the specter of heavy Government intervention and regulation caused them to clean up their acts and be very professional and self-regulate.

202
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I mean even you know, it's like they're not government organizations.

203
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:27,155
Speaker 0: But even when it's like steroids or something in the 90s like Congress Is like what and there's suddenly hearings, right?

204
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:29,839
Speaker 0: So it's like you can't fuck this shit up guys video game.

205
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,160
Speaker 0: right now You're small enough and the the old people in Congress don't have their eye on you.

206
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,349
Speaker 0: They literally don't know you exist, right?

207
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:43,840
Speaker 0: But you know what in 20 years We're gonna be the kind of people people our age are gonna be in that Congress.

208
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:50,019
Speaker 0: They're gonna know you exist and you're gonna be the next baseball Don't fuck up.

209
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,818
Speaker 1: I mean based on some metrics more people watch certain eSports tournaments than possibly watch the American Super Bowl and watch anything.

210
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:06,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Like this industry is growing rapidly and the professionalization around it is not growing fast enough And this is a collision course.

211
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:14,205
Speaker 0: so point You know It's just yet another incident and a thing that always bothers us that we point out every time and we're gonna keep pointing out every Time until stops happening.

212
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,379
Speaker 1: So the listener actually sent us two questions a while ago.

213
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:19,360
Speaker 0: Didn't we have a separate questions thing?

214
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm actually restructuring that because it was a pain and I'm gonna start that up again soon because that's a patreon driven thing.

215
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:30,700
Speaker 0: primarily People stop giving him money you're paying for and you're not getting what you paid for.

216
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:37,065
Speaker 1: But this one but they did just guy did just read on another Castlevania chapter where Simon Belmont and Timothy Bradley had a shared Orgasm over the kill.

217
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:38,090
Speaker 0: Why would you pay for that?

218
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:39,879
Speaker 0: You want to pay for him to not do that?

219
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,164
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

220
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:43,700
Speaker 1: So but this was not through the patreon.

221
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,147
Speaker 1: This is just a question that a listener sent.

222
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:46,809
Speaker 1: that was pretty good.

223
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:51,481
Speaker 1: Okay, and it was related to our writing rules Lecture.

224
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:52,103
Speaker 0: All right.

225
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:56,273
Speaker 1: So what makes an easily confusing highly debatable rule?

226
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,779
Speaker 1: Is it just inconsistent definitions or something else?

227
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,946
Speaker 0: It's just ambiguity of the language, right?

228
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:06,500
Speaker 0: Your language is not a hundred percent precise so that different there could be multiple different meanings.

229
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:07,363
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

230
00:16:07,523 --> 00:16:10,112
Speaker 0: So here's a perfect example from netrunner, right?

231
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:11,336
Speaker 0: Let me find this card.

232
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,400
Speaker 0: you talk about something.

233
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:17,300
Speaker 1: It was a new card They had to fix so I would say I back up and it's more of a design problem.

234
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:20,350
Speaker 1: What makes it confusing or debatable rule is very simple.

235
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:31,197
Speaker 1: It's any time a game designer assumes things about the players of the game without actually writing them down or Encoding them directly into the mechanics of the game itself.

236
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:38,657
Speaker 1: so like imagine if I designed a trick-taking game, right and I wrote my rules and I play tested it.

237
00:16:38,717 --> 00:16:39,100
Speaker 1: It was cool.

238
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:47,959
Speaker 1: I released it and at no point did I explain what a trick was Because I just assumed that everyone would know what a trick-taking game is.

239
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:49,805
Speaker 1: It's that kind of situation.

240
00:16:49,865 --> 00:17:10,060
Speaker 1: game designers, especially tabletop game designers, especially any tabletop game designers will very often make up rules to games and assume that the people playing them have the same basic level of game knowledge that they and all their friends do and it's Exacerbated by the fact that most indie tabletop games are play tested by other indie tabletop game designers.

241
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,659
Speaker 0: Alright, so here's a perfect example, right?

242
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:17,859
Speaker 0: So there's a new relatively new netrunner card and when this card when we first saw it everyone was like what the hell?

243
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,031
Speaker 0: We don't know how to use this card.

244
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:19,839
Speaker 0: It doesn't make any sense.

245
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:26,319
Speaker 0: It says it says a bunch of stuff But then it says use this ability only after a successful run on HQ.

246
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:31,999
Speaker 0: So wait, so if I make a successful run in HQ with the very first action I take in the whole game.

247
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:36,134
Speaker 0: Does that mean I can now use this ability any time for the rest of the game?

248
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,020
Speaker 0: Does it mean I can only use it?

249
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,205
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it is after.

250
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:41,095
Speaker 1: that's like gremlins feet after midnight.

251
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:42,100
Speaker 1: Does it want midnight?

252
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:46,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, does it mean I can only use it immediately after like I've made the successful run?

253
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,308
Speaker 0: now I can use it right now or I can't use it.

254
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:52,646
Speaker 0: or does it mean like as What time after after?

255
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,833
Speaker 0: it could be immediately after or out to infinity?

256
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,317
Speaker 0: It's not specific enough.

257
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:57,180
Speaker 0: It's ambiguous.

258
00:17:57,682 --> 00:17:58,424
Speaker 0: So they changed it.

259
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,960
Speaker 0: there's a fact that came out like yesterday that said ah, we're changing the wording on this card.

260
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,979
Speaker 0: It now says immediately after until end of turn.

261
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:12,225
Speaker 1: so Until you turn is a classic Tabletop card game design.

262
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:18,839
Speaker 0: So you make it you get your successful HQ run and then between that time and the end of the turn You can use this ability.

263
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:26,311
Speaker 0: Once the end of the turn hits you can no longer use the ability and then next turn maybe you could make a successful run HQ to reactivate the game.

264
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:28,060
Speaker 0: and now it is no longer ambiguous.

265
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:28,663
Speaker 0: It is clear.

266
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:35,100
Speaker 1: pretty much any games that have action point systems of any kind or like actions You can take tend to have until end of turn effects, right?

267
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:43,040
Speaker 0: but the point is you can see the difference between language that is not specific enough and Language that is specific enough, right?

268
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:50,560
Speaker 0: You covered all possible cases so that there are no game states that are do not match the rules.

269
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,611
Speaker 0: Right and no one has to ask any questions.

270
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,638
Speaker 0: we all the players can look at it and go.

271
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:57,752
Speaker 0: aha I know exactly what this card means.

272
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:58,780
Speaker 0: We don't have to ask about it.

273
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even in that until yesterday everyone was like this card I don't know.

274
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:09,642
Speaker 1: the person who wrote that rule made an implicit assumption that of course, it's only this turn I would.

275
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:10,306
Speaker 1: why would anyone?

276
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:11,131
Speaker 1: you shouldn't be able to?

277
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:11,292
Speaker 1: why?

278
00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:12,720
Speaker 1: how could you possibly use another turn?

279
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,125
Speaker 1: They assumed all that there was.

280
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:18,000
Speaker 0: actually there was a big update that fixed the words on a lot of cards even cards.

281
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,686
Speaker 0: We knew what they meant but had bad words.

282
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:29,268
Speaker 1: Yeah new the new person who's in charge is much better than the previous I got to admit in the modern era with any Moderately complex card game and up.

283
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:39,639
Speaker 0: I would never release it physically for these reasons But even by the amount of design in hearthstone They have something like people keep pointing out like cards with inconsistent word on them.

284
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:50,267
Speaker 0: They refuse to fix them for like various reasons Like if I'm making a card game I kind of want to make a card game that digitally just to show that I can do it better than all even though I Know it won't be successful.

285
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,180
Speaker 0: just to prove that I can do it better.

286
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,504
Speaker 1: You have Toronto who do it.

287
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:54,006
Speaker 1: You set it up.

288
00:19:54,146 --> 00:19:57,297
Speaker 1: anyone who can run tournaments for your game has a phone number.

289
00:19:57,337 --> 00:20:03,300
Speaker 1: they can call 24/7 to be like hey, we need a rules answer right now, right?

290
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:11,916
Speaker 0: But I mean, I just want to run a digital card game to prove that I can do it by myself Even better than these giant ass companies, you know, I won't have a fancy user interface.

291
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:13,040
Speaker 0: I won't have big infrastructure.

292
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:19,298
Speaker 0: My game, you know, who knows if my game will be any good, but at least I will.

293
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:23,933
Speaker 0: you know I'll be constantly modifying the game all the time to keep make sure it's fresh.

294
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:26,000
Speaker 0: I'll be won't have any rules ambiguities.

295
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,947
Speaker 0: Oh, you know all those things I'll get right.

296
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,740
Speaker 1: I wonder how consistent Billy and the Snake Man is probably garbage.

297
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:34,069
Speaker 1: And the follow-up question.

298
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:36,680
Speaker 1: What is the best rules argument you've ever had?

299
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:40,185
Speaker 1: It's actually I can imagine.

300
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,414
Speaker 0: you don't have rules arguments, right?

301
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:43,478
Speaker 0: It's like we just sort of go.

302
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:44,060
Speaker 0: what's the rule?

303
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,464
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, let's look.

304
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:47,432
Speaker 0: if we're not if we can't agree.

305
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:52,036
Speaker 0: Well, we mean what we look it up And if we can't find an answer online, it's like well fuck we don't know.

306
00:20:52,057 --> 00:20:52,600
Speaker 0: fuck this game.

307
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,568
Speaker 1: Yep, if there's official or out of we follow it.

308
00:20:54,628 --> 00:21:04,560
Speaker 1: if there isn't then unless we throw the game in the guard We either unanimously agree that we will interpret the rule as X forever more or we literally stop playing the game and never play.

309
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:08,513
Speaker 0: It's like Hellas is like the one we keep remembering a lot because like it was.

310
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:10,460
Speaker 0: like Hellas was such a promising game.

311
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:11,099
Speaker 0: You had little Greek.

312
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:12,280
Speaker 1: It felt so good.

313
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,900
Speaker 0: The two-player game and a tiny box and cards and little figures and a map and they were all Greek dudes.

314
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,199
Speaker 0: Yeah fighting and like that in a - that's a lot of good stuff for a two-player game.

315
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:28,700
Speaker 0: But this one card is like the most powerful card in the game very important and the rules for it were totally ambiguous.

316
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:29,789
Speaker 0: We couldn't get an answer.

317
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:32,527
Speaker 1: and the worst part was we thought well Let's try to play like.

318
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:39,704
Speaker 0: and that situation came up literally Every game we tried to play because every time we tried to use that card because if you had that card It was so strong.

319
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:40,448
Speaker 0: You wanted to use it.

320
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:52,214
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like well, okay I feel like the biggest rules are can't play this game ever actually had were in those early days of playing D&D Where something hinky would happen and we'd all be fighting about how that was supposed to work out.

321
00:21:52,756 --> 00:21:56,520
Speaker 1: or the big serious games of Illuminati we used to play.

322
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:06,660
Speaker 1: Because Illuminati has a lot of the rules are not ambiguous But they are complex and they don't map to other kinds of games that people like us often play.

323
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:11,586
Speaker 1: So unless everyone reads the rule book like within a few weeks I don't think is I don't?

324
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:13,980
Speaker 0: I mean, I definitely remember arguing playing Illuminati.

325
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:16,720
Speaker 0: There's no such game as Illuminati without our games are always.

326
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:19,388
Speaker 0: But now the arguments I remember.

327
00:22:19,408 --> 00:22:27,414
Speaker 0: we're not about rules that are always about like, you know, see you guys need to attack rim Turn what the fuck is wrong with you not arguments like.

328
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:28,578
Speaker 0: no you can't do this.

329
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:29,160
Speaker 0: You can't do that.

330
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,631
Speaker 1: I remember a lot of arguments around privileged attacks and when and how they could be stopped and I remember a lot of argument about that.

331
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,748
Speaker 1: Uh I also attack.

332
00:22:38,768 --> 00:22:40,000
Speaker 0: no one can assist he's privileged.

333
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:56,089
Speaker 1: I also remember having a very long argument about how to score farmers in Carcassonne but that was a long time ago when I brought Carcassonne to a gaming event in Upstate New York and I didn't bring the rules with me because I know that game and People disagreed as to how to score farmers.

334
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,960
Speaker 1: and that was when I learned that there are actually three different Official sets of rules for how to score farmers and base Carcassonne.

335
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:10,480
Speaker 0: I think you also if you're if you're playing games the people who are arguing about rules Like they insist that the rule is something, you know, either they're wrong or you're wrong, right?

336
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,424
Speaker 0: So it's not.

337
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:13,335
Speaker 0: it's not like an opinion matter.

338
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:23,976
Speaker 0: This is a factual matter you can look up and if there's no answer on the internet and Someone is still arguing and insisting that they're right and refuse, you know, it's like just don't play games with that person And don't play that game.

339
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,768
Speaker 1: Yep Well case in point look at board game geek.

340
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:33,080
Speaker 1: whenever there's a rules question and there's no official answer One of the first responses in that thread will be someone just giving an authoritative answer.

341
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:38,900
Speaker 1: Then you click on their profile and it's just Joey Jojo Shabba do from like Boise who doesn't know shit about games.

342
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if it's not an official answer, it's not an official answer.

343
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,879
Speaker 1: So apparently there's some cheating in a speed run, right?

344
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,385
Speaker 0: So generally I think of this.

345
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:52,379
Speaker 0: I only really pay a lot of attention to the speed running community for a GDQ as GDQ.

346
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,928
Speaker 0: Yep, right cuz I'm not super into it, right?

347
00:23:54,949 --> 00:24:00,185
Speaker 0: You're never gonna catch me investing time in my life into being good at it Right, but I like it.

348
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,088
Speaker 0: I respect it.

349
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:01,891
Speaker 0: I enjoy it.

350
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:04,100
Speaker 0: But you know, it's not high on my hobby list.

351
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,683
Speaker 0: It's down there.

352
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,853
Speaker 0: right to tell you I thought about two times a year.

353
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:07,355
Speaker 0: That's enough.

354
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:08,480
Speaker 0: That's way more speed.

355
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:08,982
Speaker 0: That's like.

356
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:10,570
Speaker 0: I'm pretty big fan of speed running.

357
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:15,600
Speaker 1: if I'm looking at it twice a year at RIT I remember like I found out about speed runs like like that.

358
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,953
Speaker 1: They were wider community than I thought and I thought you know what?

359
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:19,140
Speaker 1: I'm real good about a command.

360
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:28,944
Speaker 1: I wonder if I could and I watched no world record run and then I played it and time myself and I and I was like, okay, could I shave like 15 minutes and nope.

361
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:30,309
Speaker 1: No, there's no way.

362
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:37,260
Speaker 0: I generally think of the speed running community as sort of like, you know Noble and good and full of good, you know, nice people.

363
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:43,080
Speaker 0: You know, there's been a few shitheads even an SGDQ AGDQ, but they just get their asses kicked out right away.

364
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,840
Speaker 1: I think if it like WWE and professional wrestling they are professionals doing performances, right?

365
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,493
Speaker 0: And you know, it generally feels like a pretty good community.

366
00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:54,990
Speaker 0: as far as communities on the internet Go is not one of the bad ones.

367
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:57,140
Speaker 0: It's definitely far from one of the worst ones, right?

368
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,849
Speaker 0: So you did tend not to imagine there'd be too much cheating, especially since you know how much you know People are paying attention, right?

369
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,520
Speaker 0: They take these records pretty serious.

370
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:13,260
Speaker 1: I mean if the speed running community is doing a frame by frame tool assisted run I imagine they could figure out if you cheated on some friends.

371
00:25:13,765 --> 00:25:17,387
Speaker 0: I never imagined like, you know Like why would you cheat?

372
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:23,938
Speaker 0: because someone could get you on it so easily that like when you actually they said All right, do it in front of me like oh you got the world record in that.

373
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:25,787
Speaker 0: All right well, you're streaming live.

374
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:32,393
Speaker 0: I've seen people do things like they're streaming right and Like to prove that your stream is not like some pre-recorded trick.

375
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:42,396
Speaker 0: people in the chat will be like You know put a shoe on your head shoe on the head and like you have to put a shoe on your head when they chat And that way you can prove they'll have like a camera on their hands.

376
00:25:42,537 --> 00:25:43,079
Speaker 1: they'll show.

377
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,460
Speaker 0: Someone had a pre-recorded thing that they put on twitch or YouTube to make it seem like they were streaming live.

378
00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:55,056
Speaker 0: Then you know when you said put a shoe on your head prove that that that you're not.

379
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:56,300
Speaker 0: this isn't pre-recorded.

380
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,230
Speaker 0: The person who's pre-recorded on the screen wouldn't put a shoe on.

381
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:07,579
Speaker 1: I watched one guy who actually had one of his webcams was pointed Over his shoulder so you could see the screen that he was streaming from another angle that also had him in it.

382
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,368
Speaker 1: Yep, to see that they're all synced up.

383
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:09,770
Speaker 1: Yeah,

384
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:26,241
Speaker 0: you know Peter and it's like imagine It's really hard to cheat, but now apparently people would just like editing videos together You know like cutting it like getting a really good run up to a certain frame and then do another run That's really good after that frame and then come you know Do you know?

385
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:33,649
Speaker 1: that's actually clever because if someone says show me you're good enough at the game to make a plausible attempt Yeah, and world record runs are rare.

386
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,180
Speaker 1: Like when it happens in a GDQ, it's kind of amazing, right?

387
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:44,659
Speaker 0: But basically, you know various people have cheated in this way by editing videos together you know right at that one exact frame line to make it look perfect.

388
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:47,344
Speaker 0: and So they got caught.

389
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:48,548
Speaker 0: some of the people.

390
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:50,495
Speaker 0: it is definitely a thing that happened this.

391
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:52,020
Speaker 1: articles about a famous speedrun.

392
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,667
Speaker 1: I think I've seen this one, right?

393
00:26:53,707 --> 00:27:00,239
Speaker 0: So I think the deal was have I liked it as one guy One guy did it and another guy beat him by a little bit.

394
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:06,980
Speaker 0: So he went and cheated to like, you know Sort of come back and beat that guy by a whole bunch because he was upset that he lost his deal.

395
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,126
Speaker 0: But you know, you know what that is.

396
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,171
Speaker 1: that's going for the full web.

397
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:12,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he at least you know to Hand it to him.

398
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:15,835
Speaker 0: He was just like, alright guys, you got me I definitely cheated and you know, he's like just ban me.

399
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:16,439
Speaker 0: so they banned him.

400
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:20,814
Speaker 0: So I try thought about as but at least it wasn't like I didn't cheat right.

401
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:21,817
Speaker 0: that was the right response.

402
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:25,703
Speaker 0: if you You know if you do a bad thing, well, that's bad Don't do that.

403
00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:31,680
Speaker 0: But you know, at least if you come out and say alright, I did the bad thing Just give me the punishment you receive the punishment.

404
00:27:32,661 --> 00:27:34,212
Speaker 0: That's the way it's supposed to happen right?

405
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:37,450
Speaker 0: given this advice to people many times You can still at least you know, he got the.

406
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:39,320
Speaker 0: you're gonna get the punishment either way, right?

407
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,195
Speaker 0: If you would have gone rabble rabble rabble rabble, he would have still gotten bad.

408
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:45,880
Speaker 0: at least this way He's still like a respectable person, right?

409
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,851
Speaker 0: When confronted with something like this guy's some piece of shit.

410
00:27:49,072 --> 00:27:57,765
Speaker 1: if you're confronted with something where you are wrong There are literally only three possible responses and all responses that you take are Actually just a flavor.

411
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:01,640
Speaker 1: one of these three one is Stonewall literally never respond to the accusations ever.

412
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:05,091
Speaker 1: To is deny and double down.

413
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,339
Speaker 1: and three is walk it back slash admit it.

414
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:09,120
Speaker 1: Yep Those are the only three things you can do, right?

415
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,822
Speaker 0: I think you know.

416
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:14,800
Speaker 0: something I say a lot is that you know people in the world have problems and problems need solutions.

417
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,617
Speaker 0: But then there are people who are not facing problems.

418
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:20,258
Speaker 0: They're facing consequences.

419
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:23,190
Speaker 0: You're facing a consequence, right?

420
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:25,282
Speaker 0: So it's like a Problem.

421
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:27,111
Speaker 0: I have no money solution.

422
00:28:27,231 --> 00:28:27,814
Speaker 0: rob a bank.

423
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:28,377
Speaker 0: Okay.

424
00:28:28,397 --> 00:28:32,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Problem I'm in jail cuz I robbed a bank solution.

425
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:36,510
Speaker 0: Well stay in jail till you're out don't right?

426
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:37,634
Speaker 1: try to double down.

427
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:38,436
Speaker 1: break out of jail.

428
00:28:38,456 --> 00:28:38,637
Speaker 1: Yeah.

429
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:39,540
Speaker 0: No don't do that, right?

430
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,124
Speaker 0: It's like it's tough shit already.

431
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:45,117
Speaker 0: You're facing when you're facing consequences of your own actions, right?

432
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:46,521
Speaker 0: You face them You don't?

433
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:49,773
Speaker 0: there's no solution to like making the consequences go away.

434
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:51,700
Speaker 0: You're beyond that point, right?

435
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,468
Speaker 0: You've already committed the crime.

436
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,815
Speaker 0: now you're paying for it.

437
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:55,860
Speaker 0: deal with it.

438
00:28:56,301 --> 00:29:11,534
Speaker 1: As a kid in the VHS era like NES era like Nintendo Power and other people would run like contest sometimes where you had to submit a VHS tape of like a feat in a game or like a picture of your TV and The console everything showing that like you did it got a high score or something.

439
00:29:11,554 --> 00:29:25,634
Speaker 1: I Tried to enter many of those contests as a kid by taking screenshots from issues of Nintendo Power with an actual camera and a magnifying device and Send them in because I knew the way these tournaments are.

440
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:31,420
Speaker 1: these things actually worked was Everyone who submitted who had a screenshot that was plausible was basically put into a raffle.

441
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,380
Speaker 1: So I would fake the screenshots to get into the raffle.

442
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:39,238
Speaker 1: I figured I wouldn't get looked at too closely and everything was so low resolution and low fidelity.

443
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:44,100
Speaker 1: back then I figured I get away with it, but aren't those things usually like nothing required to enter?

444
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,825
Speaker 0: You can just send a post self like a postcard or a self-addressed stamp sometimes Yeah, without even.

445
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:59,380
Speaker 1: but I want to point out I was a kid with a kid brain so I Remember one was like Nintendo Power was like give us a picture of you defeating war mech.

446
00:30:00,242 --> 00:30:01,529
Speaker 1: I think it was the war mekker garland.

447
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,198
Speaker 1: I think was war mech with four white mages.

448
00:30:06,422 --> 00:30:10,335
Speaker 1: But there was a screenshot of someone doing it in that Nintendo Power.

449
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:21,069
Speaker 1: so I took a picture of that Mm-hmm, even though the names would be the same as the Nintendo Power because I never really thought about the consequences would be if I was caught Which probably would have been nothing cuz I was a jail.

450
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,939
Speaker 0: Yeah faking Final Fantasy one screenshots jail.

451
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,980
Speaker 1: So you know what in one other news related to chief he lashes?

452
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,032
Speaker 1: Pokemon go Though I don't think that many people I know play it anymore.

453
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:37,340
Speaker 0: I know one person who still plays this game.

454
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,914
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it was fun while it lasted was like a month Not at all, and I'm very glad with my decision.

455
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:44,140
Speaker 0: I'm glad I played it all.

456
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,849
Speaker 1: I'm glad I played it when I did because me it was.

457
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:53,859
Speaker 1: basically I played an AR version of Pokemon snap For like a month, and then I just uninstalled it because it's gonna go play Pokemon.

458
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:55,663
Speaker 1: Sam I'm waiting for.

459
00:30:56,065 --> 00:31:01,844
Speaker 1: actually you want a good a good Pokemon switch that you want a good use of VR would be Pokemon snap.

460
00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:02,487
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

461
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:05,057
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like the perfect game for the current level of the.

462
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:12,020
Speaker 0: actually think What would be really much better than that would be AR where a right now, right?

463
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,367
Speaker 0: Pokemon go?

464
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:21,240
Speaker 0: no no no so you know I'm Pokemon go You you go on your phone, and there's the picture of the Pokemon in there right composited on the real world.

465
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:30,067
Speaker 0: No, what if you had a real fucking camera and when you look through it right there'd be Pokemon Instead of a phone?

466
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:32,240
Speaker 1: for most people a phone camera is a real camera.

467
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,746
Speaker 1: I don't know what a real can understand.

468
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:42,884
Speaker 0: like imagine if you you know you walk around the woods with a real camera and like suddenly There's like a real Pokemon out there But with the motion controls the switch can make one fucking Pokemon game.

469
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:49,102
Speaker 0: or if you were in some sort of like AR room and they handed you a you know basically a controller that was Basically the shape.

470
00:31:49,122 --> 00:31:55,440
Speaker 0: well they are room that's installation VR, but the controller was basically a physically the shape of like a DSLR.

471
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:57,790
Speaker 0: Or was a DSLR or what?

472
00:31:57,811 --> 00:31:58,475
Speaker 0: you know what I'm saying?

473
00:31:58,495 --> 00:31:59,160
Speaker 0: you get the idea.

474
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,988
Speaker 1: But anyway Pokemon go is continuing to struggle with the problem.

475
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,277
Speaker 0: actually in Pokemon snap the actual n64 game you it was.

476
00:32:05,518 --> 00:32:06,964
Speaker 0: you didn't walk Around freely.

477
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:07,667
Speaker 1: no you're on rails.

478
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:10,480
Speaker 0: You're on rails in like an amusement park ride.

479
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:17,397
Speaker 0: You could just make that in one room Right where you sit in a little cart and the screens on all the walls and they give you a can.

480
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:20,049
Speaker 1: that is why I'm saying It's such a good use case for current level VR.

481
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:21,997
Speaker 1: Take your chair with an oculus on.

482
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:22,480
Speaker 0: it could put it.

483
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,479
Speaker 0: You don't need that you could put at an amusement park.

484
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:26,406
Speaker 0: You can have them literally on rails.

485
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,493
Speaker 0: you ride around and there's Pokemon.

486
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:30,360
Speaker 0: you take pictures of them with your real fucking cam.

487
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,972
Speaker 1: That would basically be the Men in Black ride at Disney.

488
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:34,860
Speaker 0: Can you bring your camera on and take pictures?

489
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:39,606
Speaker 1: Well, no they give you a gun when you're sitting there, so oh Well, I never wrote that.

490
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:42,240
Speaker 0: I've written like spider-man, but they don't give you a gun or anything.

491
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,385
Speaker 0: You just sit in the spider-man in black

492
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:55,779
Speaker 1: ride is basically you sit in a car with you through your family and everyone gets guns And you got to shoot aliens while you're going through the ride And you'll and you'll see you'll pass by other cars of families, and if you shoot them it spins around and they lose points

493
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,024
Speaker 0: They actually

494
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:57,486
Speaker 1: get a score.

495
00:32:57,506 --> 00:32:58,693
Speaker 0: We should do that.

496
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:01,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a we Emily I did it when we were down there last year.

497
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:02,036
Speaker 0: that sounds like good ride.

498
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:04,146
Speaker 0: It's okay It's pretty good better than you know.

499
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:08,000
Speaker 0: that like back to the future whatever where you just sit in the car doesn't even move.

500
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the back to the future felt pretty good back then.

501
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:20,399
Speaker 0: back then I mean actually like the modern equivalent of that the Simpsons ride, holy shit That spider-man one that I mean that was that's even old by now.

502
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,633
Speaker 1: I went on like 2000 if you ever get a chance to go to universal.

503
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:34,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Simpsons ride is Impressive like it's on the edge of making you nauseous like it's really pushing the limits of that level of technology One where the spider-man one used to be.

504
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:34,989
Speaker 0: that you think.

505
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,320
Speaker 1: so I remember I rode the old Star Wars one.

506
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,002
Speaker 0: I did that too.

507
00:33:39,022 --> 00:33:40,146
Speaker 0: They're also upgrading that shit.

508
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:50,174
Speaker 1: Yeah big time, but anyway Pokemon goes always had this problem where People who play the game quote-unquote seriously really quickly realize that it's just a grind.

509
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:53,821
Speaker 1: and then I'll say so a lot of them Cheats.

510
00:33:54,303 --> 00:34:02,898
Speaker 1: you know I'm making finger quotes here because they cheat by using apps to give them more information in the game or just make the game like easier, so they don't have to literally grind it all out.

511
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:06,679
Speaker 1: and Niantic you know the company has been trying to catch those people.

512
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:07,965
Speaker 0: Why what do you give a shit?

513
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:11,560
Speaker 1: because the people who don't cheat get super fucking pissed.

514
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:12,525
Speaker 0: How do they even know?

515
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:14,679
Speaker 1: because they see people talking about on the Internet?

516
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:22,741
Speaker 1: Okay, and it feels unfair because they worked so hard and that other person just like spoof GPS and got all the Pokemon around the World.

517
00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:27,300
Speaker 0: maybe you should just make your grind less stupid or maybe those people shouldn't care.

518
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,016
Speaker 1: But anyway what Niantic is doing now is basically hell-banning.

519
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:45,567
Speaker 1: So if they if they flag an account as having done anything that violates their TOS Which is basically almost anything then they just won't show you Like rare Pokemon anymore.

520
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:47,554
Speaker 1: Those never seem again in the game.

521
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:51,918
Speaker 1: Just make a new account Yeah, and start over and then get shadow banned again.

522
00:34:53,422 --> 00:34:56,351
Speaker 1: Mmm, so this you'll steal someone else's account that I got.

523
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:57,356
Speaker 1: I'm telling you the way.

524
00:34:57,376 --> 00:35:00,466
Speaker 1: the way to play Pokemon go now Is to legit be Team Rocket.

525
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:05,000
Speaker 1: go to Pokemon go meetups and parks at night and literally steal people's cell phones.

526
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,175
Speaker 1: Mmm, cuz that's Team Rocket, right?

527
00:35:08,195 --> 00:35:08,959
Speaker 1: They steal Pokemon.

528
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:13,072
Speaker 1: You can literally mug a kid and steal his Pokemon in the real world.

529
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:14,035
Speaker 1: Thanks to Pokemon go.

530
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:23,909
Speaker 1: You can just steal someone's DS, too Yeah, but kids didn't wander around holding their DS's out like this like walking around a park at 3 in the morning Like they do with Pokemon go.

531
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:26,200
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone's doing that with Pokemon go anymore.

532
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:32,859
Speaker 1: I feel like that community has shrunk substantially and I feel like the people who continue to play are crazy and are going to double down on the game forever.

533
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:42,129
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the day.

534
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:45,343
Speaker 1: So Scott insisted this was the thing of the day in the past.

535
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:46,910
Speaker 1: I could not find any reference to it.

536
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:47,714
Speaker 0: This is old.

537
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:48,639
Speaker 0: I've seen it before.

538
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:49,704
Speaker 1: It's one year old.

539
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:50,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about the year.

540
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,500
Speaker 1: It's almost as a little past the one year anniversary of this video.

541
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,243
Speaker 0: I've seen it before.

542
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:59,698
Speaker 1: It's a gamer grognard looking, dude Telling you why hero quest is so great.

543
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,023
Speaker 0: hero quest is not so great.

544
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:03,049
Speaker 1: That is the point of this video.

545
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:14,989
Speaker 1: the format is the best thing about hero quest is something and he'll talk about that for a while and then he'll just say the best thing about hero quest is something.

546
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:25,519
Speaker 1: and I can actually imagine a kind of person who would watch this video not realize that it's making fun of them and hero quest and Agree with it.

547
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:31,875
Speaker 0: I think there was that there's a thread on reddit for this video and I'm pretty sure most of the people in that thread were Totally like like hero quests.

548
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:42,660
Speaker 1: Yeah I think you the moment you have to realize he's taking the piss is the best thing about hero quest is rolling for movement Because that is not the best.

549
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,500
Speaker 0: Well, actually it is as the number one thing that makes your request back.

550
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:47,901
Speaker 0: That is

551
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:59,627
Speaker 1: the number one thing that made hero quest great when we ruined it when we played it once as adults and agreed That I would literally roll and do nothing until we all until I rolled a six And then we would play our turns

552
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:01,333
Speaker 0: and this guy's a million views.

553
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:04,787
Speaker 1: So hey, yeah, it's a pretty funny video 32,000 likes 339 dislikes not too shabby.

554
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:11,435
Speaker 1: He's got more views than my entire YouTube channel on this video.

555
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:13,723
Speaker 1: Yeah That's what he got.

556
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:20,626
Speaker 0: Oh, so we've talked about Japanese wood joining before because it's way ridiculously awesome And there's like this.

557
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:25,492
Speaker 0: we talked about this Twitter account that had like Animated gifs of you know wood joining join.

558
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:27,140
Speaker 1: the Twitter account is so good, right?

559
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:38,979
Speaker 0: This is a guy who does wood joining as a hobby And he's got a YouTube channel and the whole YouTube channel is videos of actually doing wood joining and not just you know gifts of specific joints.

560
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:44,041
Speaker 0: And the videos in particular are like ultra relaxing like the way they're well On.

561
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:46,890
Speaker 1: the channel even says this is not a how-to video.

562
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,500
Speaker 1: just sit back and join me on my venture to find beautiful joinery.

563
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:53,352
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this could replace Bob Ross for you.

564
00:37:53,412 --> 00:37:59,580
Speaker 0: If you've already watched the entire Bob Ross archive You know if you want to do some joining Don't watch this because he doesn't teach you how to do it.

565
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:09,619
Speaker 1: you're just watching a guy doing it and it's I do not want to do joining because I I Anticipate how complex it is and I had trouble like painting shitty miniatures as a kid.

566
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:11,040
Speaker 0: I mean, this is what you know.

567
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,760
Speaker 0: This is just on a list of all those zillions of awesome nerdy hobbies that I totally want to do but wouldn't invent.

568
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,530
Speaker 0: You know, yes enough time into to actually do like it's.

569
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,340
Speaker 0: like you see stuff like RC cars and paint.

570
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:27,448
Speaker 1: This is a hobby I would take up if I was Independently wealthy and bored.

571
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:36,239
Speaker 0: a skydiving like I would ever ruin my house even right But even then this would not be high rank high enough amongst all those other hobbies and I probably wouldn't do it.

572
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:40,760
Speaker 1: No, I would do it at the same level that jet black did bonsai and cowboy bebop, right?

573
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,763
Speaker 0: It was actually.

574
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,460
Speaker 0: we interviewed a guy today where skydiving is like his number one hobby.

575
00:38:45,842 --> 00:38:49,860
Speaker 0: Oh skydive like, you know without a no tandem or anything.

576
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:52,492
Speaker 0: Oh, that means you like you do like seven or eight times a year.

577
00:38:52,513 --> 00:38:54,100
Speaker 0: He goes skydiving.

578
00:38:54,961 --> 00:38:56,250
Speaker 0: So you want to go skydiving?

579
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:57,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not seven or eight times.

580
00:39:01,823 --> 00:39:02,546
Speaker 0: One time is enough.

581
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:04,013
Speaker 1: we go bungee jumping instead.

582
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:05,540
Speaker 0: That's even easier.

583
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:07,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't have to know anything.

584
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:07,833
Speaker 1: There's literally.

585
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,140
Speaker 1: there's literally no skill.

586
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:11,076
Speaker 1: You can learn to make bungee jumping more exciting.

587
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:17,040
Speaker 0: you jump Or you get pushed if they if you won't jump or they don't push you and you just go back down the stairs.

588
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:22,014
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a baby In the meta moment the booklet book is Frank Herbert's dune.

589
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,089
Speaker 1: I began in So maybe I'll read the book now.

590
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:26,598
Speaker 0: I haven't played a Zelda.

591
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:33,200
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go back to it after some other games and so I got a lot to say about Zelda.

592
00:39:33,948 --> 00:39:37,589
Speaker 1: Now that I've played the whole thing I mean, I didn't get I didn't 100% it and I'm never going to.

593
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:38,914
Speaker 0: I don't think I will either.

594
00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:42,253
Speaker 0: Anthony 100% of it Every Korok seed.

595
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:43,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, what is it?

596
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:47,100
Speaker 1: So yeah, I learned spoilers as to what happens.

597
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:49,589
Speaker 1: It's actually kind of great and I will not spoil.

598
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:57,674
Speaker 1: do not spoil for yourself the deal of the Korok seeds Because if you get all of them you learn something about the world of Zelda.

599
00:39:57,694 --> 00:39:58,857
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

600
00:39:58,917 --> 00:39:59,960
Speaker 1: You legit learn a thing.

601
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,211
Speaker 1: This is cannon the thing you learn.

602
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:04,040
Speaker 0: I didn't think you got anything for getting all the Korok seeds.

603
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,685
Speaker 0: I thought it was just alright Korok seeds.

604
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:12,460
Speaker 1: You learn something very specific about the canonical world of the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild about Korok's.

605
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,206
Speaker 1: Like you learn a thing.

606
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:17,296
Speaker 1: There's a revelation that happens.

607
00:40:17,316 --> 00:40:17,919
Speaker 0: Let's just look it up.

608
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:23,537
Speaker 1: I'm saying it's almost better if you never look it up, but I'm not getting 900 Korok seeds in my.

609
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:24,922
Speaker 1: I got 107.

610
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,232
Speaker 0: I just didn't care and I don't know how many I have.

611
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:28,960
Speaker 0: it's enough and I don't need more slots.

612
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,567
Speaker 0: I think I did 87 shrines.

613
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:36,394
Speaker 1: I want to say I don't know how many shrines I did though The last run I did before I just said fuck it and killed Ganon was.

614
00:40:36,494 --> 00:40:37,660
Speaker 1: I even tied Island.

615
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:39,787
Speaker 1: That was a pleasant surprise.

616
00:40:39,868 --> 00:40:41,193
Speaker 0: I told you to go to event at island.

617
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:42,560
Speaker 1: I see it over there and I'm like, huh?

618
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,645
Speaker 1: I bet there's stuff.

619
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:45,659
Speaker 0: No, I told you go to it like ten times.

620
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,209
Speaker 1: Yeah No, I saw it a bunch of times.

621
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:51,950
Speaker 1: then you were like you should go over there and I was like, okay so I finally went over there and stuff happens over there.

622
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:59,274
Speaker 1: that was tight island was there was unexpected and The high knocks was that was the cream on that cake.

623
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:03,129
Speaker 1: because I was like, okay I can deal with the thing that is happening to me.

624
00:41:03,571 --> 00:41:04,495
Speaker 1: and then I saw the high knocks.

625
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:09,717
Speaker 0: I'm like, ah fuck I got a traveler's sword and then it breaks.

626
00:41:09,757 --> 00:41:14,052
Speaker 1: Oh my god That was some good stuff.

627
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:16,567
Speaker 1: but Ganon goes down like a chump.

628
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:34,426
Speaker 1: I highly recommend if you're at all Burning out like if you at any point feel the slightest hint of boredom was not to the wild Just go kill Ganon and then put the game aside and pick it back up after a break because Ganon's way Way easy.

629
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:36,180
Speaker 0: I haven't even gone to Goron land at all.

630
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,732
Speaker 1: I killed Ganon pretty much just with ancient arrows for my 5x line elbow.

631
00:41:39,752 --> 00:41:41,980
Speaker 0: Well, I mean that's a 5x line elbow.

632
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:44,620
Speaker 0: I had like ancient arrows that you're really strong.

633
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:48,174
Speaker 1: I have like 80 ancient arrows because I just bought them all because why not?

634
00:41:48,274 --> 00:41:49,680
Speaker 0: I made ancient armor instead of ancient.

635
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,568
Speaker 1: I did not get the ancient armor because who cares?

636
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:54,503
Speaker 0: I want to be able to go up to ancients and be like can't touch Me, brah.

637
00:41:54,644 --> 00:41:55,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm so strong.

638
00:41:55,592 --> 00:41:56,600
Speaker 1: I just go up to ancients anyway.

639
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:56,880
Speaker 1: You know what?

640
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,241
Speaker 1: I wear.

641
00:41:57,322 --> 00:42:04,939
Speaker 1: I wear the Zora suit or the climbing suit all the time and I only wear the snow quill when I'm in like Hebrew anyway, anyway, it's good stuff.

642
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:15,948
Speaker 1: otherwise Scott's YouTube channel my deep channel the utenna shows starting up again soon because I just finally got time to work on that stuff and I will link to it in this episode.

643
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:22,480
Speaker 1: You should definitely check out because on my youtube channel I am taking literally every tabletop review we have ever done.

644
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:30,869
Speaker 1: I'm taking just the review itself out of the longer geek nights episodes and putting them on YouTube is like Just reviews of the thing.

645
00:42:31,492 --> 00:42:46,559
Speaker 1: So if you have joined geek nights Sometime later than 12 years ago and you want to see our review of like some old tabletop game And you don't listen to an hour-long bad episode of geek nights from like nine years ago This is your source for just the reviews.

646
00:42:47,927 --> 00:42:48,779
Speaker 1: so tumble seed.

647
00:42:49,661 --> 00:42:54,980
Speaker 1: We were at PAX Prime packs West while last year was a year ago, right?

648
00:42:55,161 --> 00:42:58,040
Speaker 0: It wasn't the most recent is I think it was two packs West's ago?

649
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:08,489
Speaker 1: Maybe it was one or two packs West's ago because if you haven't been to PAX West in a while Like it is expanded and sprawled Across Seattle into places.

650
00:43:08,509 --> 00:43:09,834
Speaker 1: You would have never thought pretty sure.

651
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:11,240
Speaker 0: we talked about it on the podcast.

652
00:43:11,403 --> 00:43:12,400
Speaker 0: We talked about that packs us.

653
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:19,965
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's a cards against humanity area that we had ignored the year before and we went into it this time Way big.

654
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:23,980
Speaker 0: it was way bigger than I thought and I had a bunch of rooms and not all of it was cards against humanity.

655
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:29,360
Speaker 0: There were lots of demos of indie tabletop and video games in there in addition to the cards against humanity store.

656
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:32,395
Speaker 0: I think they had like 10 bajillion copies of secret Hitler for sale.

657
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:44,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway One of the things we saw in there that really, you know It was very very memorable was the demo of the pre not released yet game called tumble seed and we saw it.

658
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:48,937
Speaker 0: Holy shit, that game is ice cold beer but a video game, but it looks cute.

659
00:43:49,058 --> 00:43:51,628
Speaker 0: Oh my god That is a game for us.

660
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,825
Speaker 1: I mean we literally we walk in the room and we're looking at it We don't say anything.

661
00:43:55,845 --> 00:44:00,562
Speaker 1: and I was looking at each other and scouts like ice cold beer and I'm like, it's ice cold beer It's I.

662
00:44:00,582 --> 00:44:04,680
Speaker 0: so if you don't know ice cold beer is a game that we discovered the first time we ever went to mag fest.

663
00:44:05,084 --> 00:44:06,600
Speaker 0: It was a big deal at that mag fest.

664
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:10,187
Speaker 0: They still have it at mag fest But it doesn't seem to be a big deal there anymore.

665
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:16,900
Speaker 0: and what that game is is an arcade machine and the arcade machine has Vertical piece of wood with a bunch of holes in it.

666
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,639
Speaker 0: So it's like you're looking straight on at a piece of Swiss cheese.

667
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,040
Speaker 0: Yep, and as a metal ball a smaller than a pinball, right?

668
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,390
Speaker 0: It's just small bearing and it's on a metal bar.

669
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:34,260
Speaker 1: so it can roll to the left or to the right and the metal bar Is sort of it's articulated like like I was about to say an antenna on a car.

670
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:35,660
Speaker 1: But no car antenna looks like that.

671
00:44:35,781 --> 00:44:36,975
Speaker 0: You have two joysticks.

672
00:44:37,198 --> 00:44:44,082
Speaker 0: one Joystick will raise the left side of the metal bar up and down and the other joystick will raise the right side of the bar Up-and-down.

673
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:53,380
Speaker 0: So if you move both sticks in unison up, you will lift the ball that is resting on this bar Straight up and if you bring both sticks down, it'll go straight down.

674
00:44:53,501 --> 00:45:07,116
Speaker 0: If you put the right stick down The ball will roll to the right and you put the left stick down the ball roll to the left and you want to get The ball from the bottom to the top without falling through any of the holes in the Swiss cheese.

675
00:45:07,558 --> 00:45:08,420
Speaker 0: and it's hard as balls.

676
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,163
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone is.

677
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:10,810
Speaker 1: everyone is that year that first year.

678
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,035
Speaker 1: We saw this at mag fest.

679
00:45:12,055 --> 00:45:15,247
Speaker 1: when we started going to mag fest all of us were like that.

680
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:22,468
Speaker 1: game looks cool and one by one on our own we all went over there and played it and discovered that it is As hard as you think it's gonna be.

681
00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:26,240
Speaker 1: it is so much harder than that that it is beyond description.

682
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,400
Speaker 0: Now, of course, there are people who are masters at this and do it.

683
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,207
Speaker 1: I watched a dude at mag fest.

684
00:45:30,247 --> 00:45:31,692
Speaker 1: just go all the way to the top first.

685
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:33,700
Speaker 1: try like just like I guess he memorized it.

686
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:35,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's such precision in the hands.

687
00:45:36,048 --> 00:45:37,513
Speaker 1: I just learned himself looking at the Wikipedia.

688
00:45:37,554 --> 00:45:38,296
Speaker 1: It's a title game.

689
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:42,883
Speaker 1: Yeah, but It was released in 1983.

690
00:45:42,883 --> 00:45:54,760
Speaker 1: It was re-released in 2003 by a different company with a Ticket dispenser and LEDs and all this new biz, but it's otherwise the exact same game.

691
00:45:54,902 --> 00:45:55,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not?

692
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:03,586
Speaker 1: The only other time it's ever been re-released was in 1984 when Taito released an identical game But they called it Zeke's peak.

693
00:46:03,907 --> 00:46:04,450
Speaker 0: I've seen that.

694
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't have beer on it.

695
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:12,114
Speaker 1: You know Zeke is Uh No, he's the main character in another title game zookeeper.

696
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:15,814
Speaker 1: Oh Love me some zookeeper keepers some hot shit.

697
00:46:15,955 --> 00:46:24,941
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah The other cool thing about this if you have one of these arcade machines You can just get a piece of wood and drill your own holes in it and make your own board and sort of swap them Out.

698
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:27,029
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any official thing for that.

699
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:27,892
Speaker 0: But you could.

700
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:28,836
Speaker 0: there's no reason you couldn't.

701
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:30,235
Speaker 0: it's just a piece of wood with Holes in it.

702
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:30,446
Speaker 0: Yeah.

703
00:46:31,142 --> 00:46:38,571
Speaker 1: But also this game was like like I guess you'd see it mostly in bars and like non-traditional Arcades, it's definitely a thing to eat your quarters, right?

704
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,037
Speaker 0: Cuz like you're really you go to it.

705
00:46:40,077 --> 00:46:40,840
Speaker 0: You see how it works.

706
00:46:41,023 --> 00:46:41,698
Speaker 0: It's kind of fun.

707
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:44,539
Speaker 0: It's got a physical ball rolling around in there.

708
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:49,779
Speaker 0: You really want to beat it and as you keep putting quarters and you get better and better and better with more practice and

709
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,700
Speaker 1: it Has a performative aspect where other people see you doing it and get excited

710
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:55,932
Speaker 0: Especially if you're getting close, right but you

711
00:46:55,972 --> 00:47:00,860
Speaker 1: watching other people if you don't play it It kind of draws you into wanting to play it same like DDR would do the same thing.

712
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:03,740
Speaker 0: I'll see you a lot of money to practice enough to be able to be good at it.

713
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:06,091
Speaker 1: I never even conceived of.

714
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:07,940
Speaker 1: hey someone should remake this kind of game.

715
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:11,451
Speaker 0: No So we saw this as someone made a video game version of it.

716
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:16,170
Speaker 0: and not only that but it was really cute your little seed tumbling around on a vine.

717
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:17,699
Speaker 0: that's a basically the metal bar.

718
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:24,345
Speaker 0: and You know suddenly there's a whole bunch of interactive stuff going on because it's not just a piece of wood It's a video game.

719
00:47:24,365 --> 00:47:30,840
Speaker 1: and then to go one step further the next piece of information We learned about this game later was that not only is it those mechanics?

720
00:47:31,484 --> 00:47:32,975
Speaker 1: But it's a roguelike.

721
00:47:33,075 --> 00:47:35,644
Speaker 1: what the Roguelike?

722
00:47:35,867 --> 00:47:37,059
Speaker 1: X ice-cold beer?

723
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,149
Speaker 1: That's the kind of crazy idea.

724
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:44,032
Speaker 1: We come up with randomly in a panel and people like wow That's a crazy idea and someone just did it.

725
00:47:44,172 --> 00:47:45,459
Speaker 0: So the game finally came out.

726
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:48,271
Speaker 0: I've been I was I saw I subscribed to like.

727
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:49,980
Speaker 0: the email me when the game is out thing.

728
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,236
Speaker 0: I'm not seeing it effects and it came out.

729
00:47:52,699 --> 00:48:00,580
Speaker 0: and Because of the timing when it came out It was originally gonna be on like we use steam whatever and I would still probably recommend the steam version.

730
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,280
Speaker 0: Except I got a Nintendo switch and they just put it out on switch.

731
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,186
Speaker 0: Yeah so I paid but 15 bucks or whatever it is.

732
00:48:07,206 --> 00:48:10,982
Speaker 0: and why did I do that instead of getting the steam one or waiting for the steam one to Be cheap?

733
00:48:11,002 --> 00:48:14,316
Speaker 1: because the switch is literally the perfect medium for this kind of game.

734
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:15,380
Speaker 0: It's so portable.

735
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:23,704
Speaker 1: Well portable but also if you play the switch like handheld the two controls are on the sides of the screen Just like.

736
00:48:23,824 --> 00:48:25,830
Speaker 1: yeah, the bar is like it feels.

737
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:26,994
Speaker 1: really it feels right.

738
00:48:27,114 --> 00:48:29,080
Speaker 0: also the switch pro controller is so good.

739
00:48:29,502 --> 00:48:33,620
Speaker 0: It's not it the Xbox controller that I'd be using if I played on the PC not as good.

740
00:48:33,781 --> 00:48:34,805
Speaker 1: So yeah, it wouldn't feel.

741
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:40,565
Speaker 1: plus that I honestly the you know that the fancy rumble in the switch Really works with this game.

742
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:45,560
Speaker 0: The switch has the most advanced like rumbling of any rumble any controller that exists.

743
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:50,278
Speaker 0: So it feels like there's a physical ball bearing rolling.

744
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:50,920
Speaker 0: It takes between.

745
00:48:51,582 --> 00:48:55,353
Speaker 0: They take the maximum advantage of that HD rumbling.

746
00:48:55,895 --> 00:49:01,340
Speaker 0: You can actually feel that ball Just like even more so than you could feel it if you're playing the real ice-cold beer.

747
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:06,017
Speaker 1: So if you couldn't guess this game is hard as balls, right?

748
00:49:06,057 --> 00:49:10,520
Speaker 0: I didn't realize that I thought it was gonna be like oh a kid looks so cute, right?

749
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,840
Speaker 0: Don't be deceived if you're looking but it's based on ice cold beer.

750
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,913
Speaker 1: That's like saying a game that's based on Dark Souls and assuming.

751
00:49:17,014 --> 00:49:17,536
Speaker 1: Oh, it's cute.

752
00:49:17,596 --> 00:49:18,380
Speaker 1: It'll probably be easy.

753
00:49:18,421 --> 00:49:18,980
Speaker 0: Don't be full.

754
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,475
Speaker 0: This game is not for people who like cute seeds and bugs and things.

755
00:49:23,756 --> 00:49:27,026
Speaker 0: that if you like what it looks like That is not enough reason to pay.

756
00:49:27,066 --> 00:49:28,872
Speaker 0: don't just keep your money right.

757
00:49:29,093 --> 00:49:32,908
Speaker 0: you only buy this if you're the kind of person who likes Super hexagon or something.

758
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:37,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you like insanely difficult Dexterity games.

759
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's when you should buy this game.

760
00:49:40,402 --> 00:49:41,126
Speaker 0: So like.

761
00:49:41,226 --> 00:49:55,040
Speaker 0: I've gotten to the point where I can beat level one pretty reliably But level two if I'm if I beat level one really strongly Then I can do level two and then if I get to level three, it's just like oh fuck you instant death, right?

762
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,003
Speaker 0: So here's how the game works.

763
00:49:56,064 --> 00:49:58,291
Speaker 0: Not only is it the the Swiss cheese, right?

764
00:49:58,653 --> 00:50:03,980
Speaker 0: But there's also enemies that come around Yep, a lot of the enemies are just basically moving holes.

765
00:50:04,322 --> 00:50:05,210
Speaker 0: You can just dodge them.

766
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:09,920
Speaker 1: not a big deal But some of them have active like if they see you they hit you some of it.

767
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,880
Speaker 0: Well, some of them will chase you the fuck down which means you must kill them, right?

768
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,531
Speaker 0: You have no or move real fast.

769
00:50:15,873 --> 00:50:16,437
Speaker 0: Good luck with that.

770
00:50:18,561 --> 00:50:20,868
Speaker 0: You have hearts so you start with three hearts.

771
00:50:20,908 --> 00:50:27,200
Speaker 0: you can get more with difficulty and if you get hit without fault without Like dying then you lose hearts.

772
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:34,278
Speaker 0: If you actually if you fall in the holes in the in the Swiss cheese, but only do you lose hearts you don't actually Just lose a heart.

773
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,873
Speaker 0: Yeah You fall down and the farther you fall the more hearts you lose to you.

774
00:50:37,953 --> 00:50:42,454
Speaker 0: if you fall from a great height You lose a whole lot of hearts and die instantly.

775
00:50:42,535 --> 00:50:43,520
Speaker 0: So yeah, it sucks.

776
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,525
Speaker 0: So you also have crystals.

777
00:50:45,545 --> 00:50:51,100
Speaker 0: you start the game with one fucking crystal and you can get more crystals by picking them up off the ground.

778
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:56,268
Speaker 0: Killing enemies sometimes will drop enemies Always pretty much but you get crystals.

779
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:56,729
Speaker 0: then you can.

780
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,659
Speaker 0: there's plots on the ground that are diamond shape.

781
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,559
Speaker 1: now This is what's clever.

782
00:51:00,701 --> 00:51:06,269
Speaker 1: They they basically I imagine the developers of the game said we're gonna make an ice-cold beer roguelike I assume they.

783
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:07,620
Speaker 1: they saw ice-cold beer, right?

784
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,333
Speaker 1: So you but they they explored it as much as possible.

785
00:51:11,373 --> 00:51:13,040
Speaker 1: so they don't just have holes to kill you.

786
00:51:13,422 --> 00:51:15,657
Speaker 1: They have plots to attract you, right?

787
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:37,400
Speaker 0: so you want to go on these plots and what happens is you can switch which seed you are and you with four seeds and you can get more or check cash a man and get different seeds, but each seed is an ability sort of like curvy and When you roll over a plot based on what seed you have selected and you could change your seeds anytime from the ones that you have That is what will happen when you roll over the plot.

788
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,460
Speaker 0: So the flag flag seed is the one you sort of start as and what that does is for absolutely free.

789
00:51:43,882 --> 00:51:52,940
Speaker 0: When you roll over a plot it puts a flag there checkpoint And if you die by falling in a hole you will come out at that checkpoint where you put that flag.

790
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:55,060
Speaker 1: I try to avoid using that because I'm not a baby.

791
00:51:55,243 --> 00:51:56,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't want to use it.

792
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:01,220
Speaker 0: But like if you're in level two or three and you've made it quite a distance you put down a flag.

793
00:52:01,341 --> 00:52:11,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, so well think of it like, you know in Like games where you like a shovel knight or you could destroy the checkpoint to get some loot or use the checkpoint.

794
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,528
Speaker 0: But anyway, the next one is the crystal see.

795
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:17,229
Speaker 0: the crystal see you want to sort of avoid using because it sucks But sometimes you have to use it.

796
00:52:17,249 --> 00:52:17,874
Speaker 0: It's remote.

797
00:52:17,894 --> 00:52:23,376
Speaker 0: I think of yeah The way the crystal one works is you when you've hit one plot nothing happens.

798
00:52:23,517 --> 00:52:28,800
Speaker 0: you get the second plot Nothing happens, but when you hit the third plot with the crystal seed two crystals come out.

799
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:34,664
Speaker 0: So you pretty much only use this when you're desperate for crystals because once the game is starts going and you're like getting halfway Through level one.

800
00:52:35,046 --> 00:52:37,479
Speaker 0: You should have a ton of crystals and not really need anymore, right?

801
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,179
Speaker 0: So usually I cash in that crystal seed and get a different seed.

802
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:54,643
Speaker 0: The third seed is the spike thorn seed and what this does is you roll over a plot you lose a crystal and you know cut and you get a thorn that now like spins around you right and you can make a whole big shield out of Thorns.

803
00:52:55,449 --> 00:52:58,086
Speaker 0: and when you bump into bad guys You can kill them with your thorns.

804
00:52:58,106 --> 00:53:00,415
Speaker 0: and if a bad guy shoots guns at you and they hit you.

805
00:53:00,737 --> 00:53:02,788
Speaker 0: if they hit a thorn You just lose the thorn.

806
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:03,371
Speaker 0: You don't get hit.

807
00:53:03,874 --> 00:53:07,000
Speaker 0: if you can, you know, sort of did So like these are your weapons and also your shields.

808
00:53:07,441 --> 00:53:09,548
Speaker 0: That are the basic ones a melee weapon.

809
00:53:09,628 --> 00:53:13,460
Speaker 1: and then there's well a bunch more that are way increasingly crazy and complex.

810
00:53:13,781 --> 00:53:15,515
Speaker 0: Well, there's the other non complex.

811
00:53:15,535 --> 00:53:15,958
Speaker 0: was the heart?

812
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,220
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, if you get the heart seed you go one.

813
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:26,580
Speaker 0: It costs you a crystal to go to a plot with a heart But once you've done four plots with four crystals, you actually increase your life by one heart total.

814
00:53:26,961 --> 00:53:32,860
Speaker 1: Oh, uh cold guy confirmed that the guys the designers of this game were ice-cold beer pro players.

815
00:53:33,182 --> 00:53:35,436
Speaker 0: Okay, so that's why they think it's easy.

816
00:53:35,638 --> 00:53:40,293
Speaker 0: Yeah So you try to avoid using the crystal seed.

817
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:43,391
Speaker 0: I use the heart seed a lot But I guess if you're really good, you don't need to really.

818
00:53:43,411 --> 00:53:44,800
Speaker 1: they were in an ice-cold beer league.

819
00:53:45,382 --> 00:53:47,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't need to use the heart seed either if you're really good, right?

820
00:53:48,216 --> 00:53:49,563
Speaker 0: So but What?

821
00:53:49,704 --> 00:53:53,000
Speaker 0: the thing that makes this game even harder than like it's a freaking ice-cold beer.

822
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,559
Speaker 0: There's a million holes in the board.

823
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,331
Speaker 0: The bad guys are coming at you like crazy is that if you get hit.

824
00:53:58,953 --> 00:54:01,300
Speaker 0: when you lose a heart you lose all your thorns.

825
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:02,678
Speaker 0: Yep, all of them.

826
00:54:03,081 --> 00:54:09,001
Speaker 0: It's like I've been in situations where I got like a fuck ton of thorns and a bad guy hits me and I just lose them All.

827
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:12,535
Speaker 0: and now the real resource in this game is not the crystals.

828
00:54:12,897 --> 00:54:13,620
Speaker 0: It is the plots.

829
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:15,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, I felt I fall backwards.

830
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:18,560
Speaker 1: I have to climb back up to where I've already used all those plots.

831
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,025
Speaker 0: All those plots are used.

832
00:54:20,045 --> 00:54:23,980
Speaker 0: There's no more plots and I'm running out of hearts and I'll fuck me.

833
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:29,093
Speaker 0: I'm basically done even though it's like it's not actually a one-shot kill But it might as well be just reset.

834
00:54:29,153 --> 00:54:36,365
Speaker 1: now does some nice stuff Like if you fall in a hole it turns that hole into a plot big deal so you won't die Fucking fly.

835
00:54:36,465 --> 00:54:37,671
Speaker 1: It's subtle, but it's there.

836
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,897
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

837
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:41,880
Speaker 1: Whatever That's how you solve some of the puzzles in the puzzle.

838
00:54:42,142 --> 00:54:44,700
Speaker 0: The other thing is you can get more seeds with more abilities, right?

839
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,580
Speaker 0: But the problem is the vast majority of these extra abilities you can get are just gonna fuck you over.

840
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,538
Speaker 0: There's one that's like, okay Projectiles are now bigger.

841
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,199
Speaker 0: Also the bad guys project doesn't happen.

842
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:59,620
Speaker 0: There's one that you think could be like the best possible one is the magnet power.

843
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:08,039
Speaker 0: It sucks crystals into you if they're lying on the ground because sometimes the crystal will be like on the edge of a pin Right, so you don't have to roll over there and get it.

844
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:14,820
Speaker 0: So now you can just sort of casually go safely up the board and get a lot of crystals without having to put in A lot of effort and that's super good.

845
00:55:14,861 --> 00:55:15,418
Speaker 0: But you know what?

846
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,928
Speaker 0: There's a few crystal shaped bad guys that will.

847
00:55:18,008 --> 00:55:21,280
Speaker 0: you'll suck them into motherfucker and they're all over the motherfucker.

848
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:22,467
Speaker 0: They're all over the place.

849
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:24,420
Speaker 0: there's like almost no ability.

850
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,500
Speaker 0: There's an ability that's like oh you get a friend who bounces around the screen dealing damage.

851
00:55:29,182 --> 00:55:30,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy's not your friend.

852
00:55:30,867 --> 00:55:34,477
Speaker 0: He does around the screen dealing damage to bad guys, but also to you.

853
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:35,480
Speaker 0: Good luck.

854
00:55:36,023 --> 00:55:45,880
Speaker 1: So I mean this this game is great Qualified with you either have to be really into dexterity games really into ice-cold beer specifically.

855
00:55:46,701 --> 00:55:50,619
Speaker 1: Uh That's it like that's who this game is for.

856
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:51,647
Speaker 0: I can't really say like.

857
00:55:51,687 --> 00:56:00,156
Speaker 0: I've been playing this game and I you know Despite it being so hard and annoying like I haven't yet given up on it Like I'm still playing it like once a day twice a day or whatever.

858
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:06,127
Speaker 0: like, you know It you know and this there's a daily thing where like everyone gets the same Board because it rent.

859
00:56:06,168 --> 00:56:07,274
Speaker 0: it's procedurally generated.

860
00:56:07,314 --> 00:56:08,139
Speaker 0: It's a roguelike, right?

861
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,023
Speaker 0: No, it's different.

862
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:11,860
Speaker 0: every time you play I have a decker dancer has that to the daily challenge.

863
00:56:11,961 --> 00:56:18,220
Speaker 0: I haven't reached the top yet But there's a daily challenge and even on the switch it connects to the internet and downloads the daily challenge properly.

864
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:32,946
Speaker 1: So that's that's a pretty cool thing you can do, but I would say that if you are an enthusiast of games not just like a gamer who plays games like you're interested in game design or you care more about like the Theory of games or anything like that.

865
00:56:33,668 --> 00:56:37,099
Speaker 1: You should get this game just because there's literally nothing else like it.

866
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:41,187
Speaker 0: No, this is absolutely 100% unique game.

867
00:56:41,288 --> 00:56:44,080
Speaker 1: This is in a genre where there are literally only two entries.

868
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,732
Speaker 1: There is ice-cold beer and there is this and roguelikes.

869
00:56:47,873 --> 00:56:50,100
Speaker 0: Yes, but is this rogue and ice-cold beer?

870
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,666
Speaker 0: But this is the combination of the two.

871
00:56:51,747 --> 00:56:57,811
Speaker 0: and yeah, a lot of people are doing the combined two games thing lately But no one's done to combine these two games.

872
00:56:57,952 --> 00:57:03,320
Speaker 1: Yep, right in this kind of way It's just kind of amazing that it came to pass and it's clear.

873
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,003
Speaker 1: you know that they.

874
00:57:04,384 --> 00:57:16,147
Speaker 1: they clearly took a very simple concept and tried to Add as much depth and complexity and interesting situations as they could while never Straying from that core mechanic.

875
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:20,923
Speaker 0: The only thing I would say is that you know when I look at how far I'm getting up The mountain before dying.

876
00:57:20,943 --> 00:57:24,254
Speaker 0: I'm actually like kind of halfway or even more than halfway up.

877
00:57:24,715 --> 00:57:26,783
Speaker 0: It just gets ridiculously hard I think they.

878
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:34,615
Speaker 0: I would have liked it if they would have made the mountain taller and Had more of a curve of difficulty like why not go back to ice-cold beer?

879
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:38,891
Speaker 1: ice-cold beer is easy easy And then it just goes from impossible to more impossible.

880
00:57:39,052 --> 00:57:41,040
Speaker 0: I know this exponential curve of difficulty.

881
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:48,540
Speaker 0: No, this goes from immediately hard and then impossible and then like even worse than doom nightmare mode impossible.

882
00:57:48,761 --> 00:57:53,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just like I would have liked them to stretch out that curve a little more to be more linear and less exponential.

883
00:57:54,141 --> 00:58:00,368
Speaker 0: So it's like start off ridiculously easy get challenging Right and then get hard.

884
00:58:00,649 --> 00:58:04,080
Speaker 0: and you know, let me enjoy the game more before you brutally kill me.

885
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,447
Speaker 0: I'm not saying don't brutally kill me.

886
00:58:05,728 --> 00:58:07,839
Speaker 0: I'm just saying give me like one or two more.

887
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:13,700
Speaker 0: You know climbs worth of space before, you know, cuz like at the beginning of like level two.

888
00:58:14,442 --> 00:58:23,880
Speaker 0: It's like they send a snake and a guy after you who shoots at you constantly And if you don't already have enough spikes or weapons to take them out you're dead.

889
00:58:24,241 --> 00:58:26,148
Speaker 0: And also there's a million holes right there.

890
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:28,135
Speaker 0: Good luck dodging the holes and those guys.

891
00:58:28,396 --> 00:58:29,360
Speaker 0: It's just like level two starts.

892
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:29,904
Speaker 0: Good luck.

893
00:58:30,024 --> 00:58:32,260
Speaker 1: You're dead, but at the same time there's only so much you can do with this.

894
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:48,259
Speaker 1: We have to start to level three, so I appreciate the fact that it escalates itself rapidly to be a more succinct experience much like A good example of other games they've done like Jenga babies play safe moves for a long time.

895
00:58:48,339 --> 00:58:52,210
Speaker 1: pros Destabilize the tower as much as possible as early as possible.

896
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:53,834
Speaker 0: I just want to enjoy my $15.

897
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:54,356
Speaker 0: I spent more.

898
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,048
Speaker 1: I'm playing it for the experience.

899
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, the experience is gonna be one minute long.

900
00:59:01,459 --> 00:59:04,515
Speaker 1: Yeah I was trying to play it last night.

901
00:59:04,535 --> 00:59:06,385
Speaker 1: It was just five.

902
00:59:06,425 --> 00:59:12,660
Speaker 1: I did better when I Threw caution to the wind kind of like in Mario games like especially 2d Mario's like the older ones.

903
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:15,971
Speaker 1: The more you just went for it the better you tended to do.

904
00:59:16,071 --> 00:59:20,950
Speaker 0: I tend to alternate between being careful and going for it Right, you know and what ends up happening.

905
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:25,089
Speaker 1: usually if I get hit not in a hole I'm just like fuck it.

906
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:26,158
Speaker 1: Go go go go go go go go.

907
00:59:26,641 --> 00:59:33,565
Speaker 0: The situation that usually kills me is when there's too much going on and like I'm like one bad guy comes He's a really dangerous.

908
00:59:33,585 --> 00:59:39,188
Speaker 0: So I try to carefully take care of him and like when not a lot is going on It's a little safer then I can sort of go for it.

909
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:45,813
Speaker 0: But when like multiple hazards all at once It's like I'm forced to go for it, but I'm not I can't.

910
00:59:46,174 --> 00:59:47,820
Speaker 1: I can't even beat ice-cold beer.

911
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:52,720
Speaker 1: I played that game a lot and there's no bugs in there unless there's I guess termites in the cabinet.

912
00:59:53,521 --> 00:59:55,030
Speaker 1: There's literally just the holes.

913
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:59,925
Speaker 1: you can take as long as you need These two quotes.

914
00:59:59,985 --> 01:00:03,579
Speaker 1: I've never really looked at the site for the game much before but I'm looking at these quotes here.

915
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:08,331
Speaker 1: So Jerry Hawkins a game about moving laterally in a world that hates you.

916
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:12,120
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and Adam Selzmann says the Dark Souls of marble rolls.

917
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:15,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is some sort of lore in this game.

918
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,494
Speaker 0: Like you can talk to kids.

919
01:00:16,555 --> 01:00:17,860
Speaker 0: It's RPG roguelike, right?

920
01:00:18,403 --> 01:00:20,959
Speaker 1: This character like going to talk to the elder.

921
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can talk to people.

922
01:00:22,525 --> 01:00:24,130
Speaker 0: they say stuff and there's some kind of.

923
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:24,672
Speaker 0: there's like us.

924
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:27,604
Speaker 0: occasionally you'll enter like in the middle of The map.

925
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,838
Speaker 0: there'll be like this you can go.

926
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:35,140
Speaker 0: It seems like an abandoned hut with a lab that got destroyed or something and there's some sort of plot of mystic shit going on.

927
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,454
Speaker 0: But I'd have to be able to reach the tap to know what's going on with it.

928
01:00:39,037 --> 01:00:39,720
Speaker 1: I'm on the website.

929
01:00:40,061 --> 01:00:40,724
Speaker 1: I never.

930
01:00:40,744 --> 01:00:45,200
Speaker 1: I never went to their website quote originally inspired by the forgotten arcade classic ice-cold bear.

931
01:00:45,421 --> 01:00:53,093
Speaker 1: yeah, Tumblesee is made by five people in Chicago Benedict Greg Joel David and Jenna and a bunch of their friends and published by iowoo.

932
01:00:53,890 --> 01:01:07,832
Speaker 0: Okay so I if you hate yourself if you hate yourself and you own a Nintendo switch or you can just plan steam I Get it on ps4 or you can get it on like, you know anything just it's.

933
01:01:07,995 --> 01:01:17,119
Speaker 1: uh it's refreshing that a game like this was able to be made and came out because like The the lineage of this game is kind of insane when you think about it.
