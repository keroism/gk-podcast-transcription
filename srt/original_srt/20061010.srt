1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,360
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday October 10th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,510
Speaker 1: We will discuss many old and varied Atari game.

3
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,927
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:28,840
Speaker 0: so today at my job I came to a Conclusion that has somewhat disheartened me.

5
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,845
Speaker 1: This is not new information.

6
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:32,107
Speaker 1: You knew this before.

7
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:32,549
Speaker 1: what did?

8
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:34,998
Speaker 0: No, no, I think the difference.

9
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:37,486
Speaker 0: I knew the fact that I've discovered today.

10
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:38,490
Speaker 0: I knew that it was true.

11
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:45,887
Speaker 0: I did not realize the absolute magnitude of the fact or the situation I am in.

12
00:00:45,907 --> 00:01:05,309
Speaker 0: you see I Have discovered that I am a little bit overqualified For the position I hold at my company meaning I could train a monkey to do my job And people who are in the exact same position of me as me know less about computers than my mom.

13
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:14,150
Speaker 0: Aha Take a long story short Guy, I got to do a project real quick thing got to do something to some PCs.

14
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:20,810
Speaker 0: So a guy at my office who has the same position as me who apparently knows about this is supposed to.

15
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:24,607
Speaker 0: You know take me down to the lab show me what needs to be done and I can go off and do it.

16
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:34,322
Speaker 0: All right so it's a terminal emulator kind of like telnet hyper terminal and You've got to make a new icon that points to a different IP address.

17
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:35,064
Speaker 0: No big deal.

18
00:01:35,626 --> 00:02:03,635
Speaker 0: So he shows me an excruciating somewhat incorrect detail how to do this and the way he shows me is Copying the shortcut and renaming it and then going into the shortcut that he just made which points to the same place as the one He just made a copy of changing the settings saving it and then running it to which I said but won't that change the settings on the program because the shortcuts both point at the same place where the Configuration data is that you changed?

19
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,786
Speaker 0: and his response was you know, we had a problem with that before.

20
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:12,470
Speaker 0: you think that'll solve it And I about beat my head against the desk.

21
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,032
Speaker 1: God,

22
00:02:14,555 --> 00:02:37,200
Speaker 0: I could go into great detail exactly why this was done, but It's weird how I went from a position where I was basically the head sysadmin of like 300 Linux Machines and I was a cosas admin on a whole bunch of critical servers and I helped manage a data center and a raised floor to Basically doing more on work yet.

23
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,109
Speaker 0: I get paid more money and have better benefits doing it.

24
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:46,450
Speaker 1: We really need to make a company that goes around to other companies and make sure this kind of stupidity doesn't happen.

25
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,678
Speaker 0: I don't know what to what to think or do.

26
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:50,345
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

27
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:51,690
Speaker 0: This just isn't cool.

28
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:55,570
Speaker 1: I mean in other professions, I mean if you're a plumber, right?

29
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,486
Speaker 1: You don't go to other plumbers and say wow that guy doesn't know how to plumb.

30
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:01,830
Speaker 1: what's he doing plumbing?

31
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:14,670
Speaker 1: you know if you're on if you work for a company in which does a bunch of copy machine repairmen You know it I can't imagine that one guy actually knows how to repair copiers and the other guys that don't know.

32
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:19,988
Speaker 1: You know all of those guys there know how to repair copiers and you call for your copy to copier to be repaired.

33
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,233
Speaker 1: a guy Shows up.

34
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:22,358
Speaker 1: It's always a different guy.

35
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:23,624
Speaker 1: They always know what the hell they're doing.

36
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:24,770
Speaker 1: You know, they do the job.

37
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:32,190
Speaker 1: Why is it in the IT industry that we know what the hell we're doing and most people don't have a clue?

38
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:48,589
Speaker 0: I mean I complained a lot about IBM but I got to say most of my complaints were with the company as a whole and The employees I ended up interacting with outside of my own department because the people in my department Pretty much knew what they were doing and we're pretty cool.

39
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:56,369
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of them had a lot of skills that really aren't so common anymore and by and large They were interesting people.

40
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:59,220
Speaker 0: They they were interested in the weird stuff.

41
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:07,390
Speaker 0: I did and when they asked me a technical question They not only expected a technical answer, but they took my advice into consideration.

42
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:12,407
Speaker 0: Like if they wanted something Linux, they'd come to me and be like, hey, is this feasible?

43
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:12,729
Speaker 0: or hey?

44
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,994
Speaker 0: What do you know about this?

45
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:17,589
Speaker 0: and they'd listen this company's like Linux was the fuck.

46
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:21,257
Speaker 0: Now there are smart people at this company.

47
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:24,849
Speaker 0: I gave a guy Ubuntu and he is all about this.

48
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:28,962
Speaker 0: now It's just uh, I don't know what to say.

49
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:31,410
Speaker 0: I could I should just quit and get a better job.

50
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:33,429
Speaker 0: I could probably make twice as much money as I make now.

51
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:38,705
Speaker 1: So my job right on do anything and I could also probably making twice as much money somewhere else.

52
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:40,409
Speaker 1: I got an email today.

53
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,297
Speaker 1: Holy crap, did they fire you now?

54
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:44,340
Speaker 0: Did they give you work?

55
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:46,327
Speaker 1: No kind of not really.

56
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:47,370
Speaker 1: Well, I've had work.

57
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,265
Speaker 1: I just haven't been doing it because no one cares if I do it or not.

58
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:51,110
Speaker 1: No one got attention.

59
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,480
Speaker 0: I'll trade you you realize every day for the last two weeks.

60
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,615
Speaker 0: I've asked my boss directly and straight up Is there any work for me to do?

61
00:04:58,157 --> 00:04:59,200
Speaker 0: I'll do something.

62
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:01,167
Speaker 0: Give me something to do and I'll do it.

63
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:01,889
Speaker 0: You're paying me.

64
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:08,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have a few projects to be working on but they don't have deadlines and no one pays attention or cares.

65
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:11,750
Speaker 0: No one talks to see everyone acts like they're so busy at my company.

66
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:16,150
Speaker 0: But then they offer my services and not to sound big-headed, but I'm a badass.

67
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:20,830
Speaker 0: I can do anything they asked me to do and they just don't take advantage of me at all.

68
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,384
Speaker 0: But yet they complain constantly that they're under deadlines.

69
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:24,410
Speaker 0: They can't finish anything.

70
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,582
Speaker 1: Anyway, the email I got today was concerning a project that did.

71
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:31,410
Speaker 1: I worked at the most recent work that I actually did.

72
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:40,408
Speaker 1: I actually did something, you know about a month ago I and I made this new website, but I didn't do any CSS because they hired some designers or anything.

73
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:40,829
Speaker 1: So it's good.

74
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:41,775
Speaker 0: I don't like just.

75
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,434
Speaker 1: it's just crappy ass plain HTML.

76
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:52,393
Speaker 1: it looks like it looks really bad because it's just a form that's completely Unstyled or anything.

77
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:59,169
Speaker 1: It's just you know form input input input input slash form and it's a bunch of forms and links and that's it.

78
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,710
Speaker 1: So they're like, yeah, we're putting there's a new server coming this week.

79
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,410
Speaker 1: We're putting that thing up on it by the end of the week and it was a CC to me.

80
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,190
Speaker 1: It was actually to someone else because they were having to set up.

81
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:20,469
Speaker 0: This happened to you where someone will email someone else with a bunch of important stuff That you that you haven't heard of before and they CC you but they don't mention you.

82
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:22,817
Speaker 0: So you have the sense of all.

83
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:25,204
Speaker 0: right was ICC because they want me to do something.

84
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,528
Speaker 1: So I sent an email.

85
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:26,910
Speaker 1: I'm like.

86
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:35,016
Speaker 1: You guys know that that thing isn't CSS, right and you know that You know some.

87
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:36,888
Speaker 1: you know, I designed this thing.

88
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:43,296
Speaker 1: basically I offered to make this thing because I was kind of interested in making it and They said okay go to it.

89
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:46,810
Speaker 1: So I did but I did it without any input from the people who are using it.

90
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:53,109
Speaker 1: So I'm like, yeah, and maybe you know We should have someone who's actually gonna end up using this thing look at it to make sure it's what they want.

91
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:57,143
Speaker 1: And I was like is this server a production server or whatever?

92
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:02,425
Speaker 1: They're like, oh, yeah The new company websites going up Saturday night blah blah blah blah.

93
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:06,821
Speaker 1: I'm like, ah I'm like, can you maybe keep me in the loop on things?

94
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:07,382
Speaker 1: maybe?

95
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:13,787
Speaker 1: so now they today I Started getting kept in the loop on things and it's just a bunch of useless emails.

96
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:14,530
Speaker 0: good job.

97
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,565
Speaker 1: So it's like they were giving me out of the loop and how I'm in it and I thought it's nothing.

98
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:19,670
Speaker 0: There's really no loop.

99
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:22,761
Speaker 1: It's I I don't know.

100
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:24,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, so so

101
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:30,330
Speaker 1: this week I think I'm gonna do a little bit of work on that thing and just make my own decisions and say ha ha and you

102
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:38,340
Speaker 0: Think I'm gonna set up some hamachi and then I'm just gonna start building a lamp server and writing stupid web Applications to learn we already

103
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,570
Speaker 1: have a lamp server in the other room.

104
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:44,710
Speaker 0: No I'm gonna make my own on this box sitting here and I'm gonna futz with it and break it in.

105
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,298
Speaker 1: What is the one we already got?

106
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:48,570
Speaker 0: because I plan to break it and fix it over and over again.

107
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:50,201
Speaker 1: I break that one and fix it all the time.

108
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:56,950
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway Yeah, I'm just gonna start doing like I did at IBM whenever was bored at IBM.

109
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,103
Speaker 0: I'd like build a Linux server and install Samba on it or something.

110
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:05,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ubuntu is a good Distribution to run lamp on because it the it works really nice.

111
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,025
Speaker 1: Not only that but they're the configuration files are organized in an intelligent manner.

112
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:10,070
Speaker 0: their instructions online.

Speaker 0: video game metal band myspace comm slash entertainment system.

126
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:50,016
Speaker 0: We want to give them mad props because we've seen them in concert twice and they're doing a huge concert in at Penn State College, Pennsylvania October 28th.

127
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:50,718
Speaker 1: Yep.

128
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:54,650
Speaker 0: We're gonna plug it a lot because they're badasses and they deserve recognition.

129
00:08:55,202 --> 00:09:02,074
Speaker 0: Indeed - we saw the video game pianist and hung out with him and he's an awesome, dude Even though it's really modest.

130
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:03,418
Speaker 1: video game penis calm.

131

Speaker 0: Yeah, it sounded like you said video game penis.

132
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,150
Speaker 1: I know that's why I did.

133
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:14,362
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah All I got to say is that not only is this guy awesome But he is way more modest than he needs to be dude.

134
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:20,429
Speaker 0: It is okay for you to say that you were cool Yeah, and he was like Looking for some ladies.

135
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,882
Speaker 1: You know if he wasn't so modest.

136
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:24,128
Speaker 1: he could probably get mad.

137
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,394
Speaker 0: ladies I could anyways.

138
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:28,550
Speaker 0: problem is he plays at video game cons instead of anime cons.

139
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,913
Speaker 1: Yeah There was.

140
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:35,090

141
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,034
Speaker 1: He should ask her out.

142
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:36,817
Speaker 0: Actually.

143
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:41,436

144
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:43,466
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz that would be really freaking cool.

145
00:09:43,486 --> 00:09:44,410
Speaker 1: That would be too awesome.

00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:53,570
Speaker 0: So yeah video game pianist if you guys didn't go to sitcom you missed out on a Real up close and personal concert with this kid because it was basically this giant.

147
00:09:53,811 --> 00:10:00,829
Speaker 1: It was a convention that was put on as if there was a thousand people there and only like less than 200 people showed up.

148
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:03,900
Speaker 1: So it's like there's this big con and you were all.

149
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,445

160
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:45,330
Speaker 1: whatever Gillette's newest fangled.

161
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,015

00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:47,658
Speaker 1: really awesome.

163
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:49,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, so and one blade.

00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:51,470
Speaker 0: now, we're not gonna talk about this.

165
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,867
Speaker 0: We've talked about it on the show many times, but the mind is shaving episode.

166
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:55,410
Speaker 1: It's real old.

167
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,175
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact Emily's on that episode.

168
00:10:57,355 --> 00:11:01,446
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the Gillette Mach 3 is shite shite shite shite.

169
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:02,790
Speaker 0: It costs more than video games.

170
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:05,890
Speaker 1: It costs more than video.

171
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:10,146
Speaker 0: God Gillette is a terrible company and their razors are terrible.

172
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:20,798
Speaker 0: But anyway they send every man in the United States who is a citizen for the most part that they know about a razor when they turn 18 or in some places 21 usually 18.

173
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:25,997
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and This has been going on since I was 18.

174
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:27,300

Speaker 0: Yeah, the point is something who knows all these people are talking about like.

183
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:52,330
Speaker 0: this is news.

184
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,136
Speaker 0: How is Gillette finding this information out?

185
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:54,657
Speaker 0: blah blah.

186
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,744
Speaker 0: This is the oldest freaking news.

187
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,350
Speaker 0: This has been going on forever.

188
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:01,430
Speaker 0: They get the information from all sorts of places.

189
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:06,610
Speaker 0: It's not a big deal when they send you the razor use it once because you might as well then throw it away.

190
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:08,113
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

191
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,138
Speaker 0: Anyway real news video games.

192
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:10,939
Speaker 1: Okay.

193
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:14,788
Speaker 1: So today was the day of pre-ordering ps3s.

194
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:17,840
Speaker 0: Holy crap And they all went immediately.

195
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,990
Speaker 1: Yep, pretty much every GameStop.

196
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:25,587
Speaker 1: I think the the official GameStop corporate line is that they have 3600 stores.

197
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:30,068
Speaker 1: Each store had but had at least eight ps3s.

198
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:35,531
Speaker 1: Some of them had up to 16.

199
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:41,750
Speaker 1: At most two of them per store could be pre-ordered by the staff and the rest had to go to actual people.

200
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:50,023
Speaker 0: I point out that one of the first things I read about this was a guy from an EB talking about how Four of theirs went to the staff and another guy.

201
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:51,490
Speaker 1: This is the GameStop party line.

202
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,830
Speaker 1: GameStop is one big company now.

203
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:01,780
Speaker 1: However, EB and GameStop are still run sort of separately kind of like YouTube and Google video But not.

204
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:07,290
Speaker 0: and I saw another Where the guy was like, yeah, the employees in our store got all of them and they're all on eBay.

205
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:13,917
Speaker 1: Well, cuz what'll happen is, you know to the two of them officially if you're at a GameStop two of them Officially go to the staff.

206
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:15,750
Speaker 1: So those are the guys working in the store.

207
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,950
Speaker 1: Alright, so if you got any other six employees are waiting outside at the front of the line.

208
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:26,609
Speaker 0: If you've got a store with three employees Yeah, yeah, but here's the interesting thing.

209
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:32,690
Speaker 0: There were like 15 pre-orders for sale on eBay like this morning.

210
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:41,239
Speaker 1: The thing and different stores have different policies on these pre-orders, you know Some of them say you pre-order you got one.

211
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,810
Speaker 1: some of them say you pre-order you'll get one as soon as we can.

212
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,850
Speaker 1: Some of them say you pre-order that means you have a spot in line.

213
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,510
Speaker 1: So if you come here on launch day and there's a line of which there will be you have your pre-order slip.

214
00:13:54,872 --> 00:14:03,230
Speaker 1: So you get in the front of the you, you know, you go Behind all the people who showed up before you with pre-order slips, but before the people who don't have pre-order slips.

215
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,979
Speaker 1: so if the store opens at 8 a.m.

216
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,587
Speaker 1: And you get there at 805 with your pre-order.

217
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:12,464
Speaker 1: slip your Sol because some guy without one is in line ahead of you.

218
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,834
Speaker 0: I got to say one thing I want to see.

219
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:25,490
Speaker 0: I want to keep track of how many of these things go up on eBay as a Percentage of the total pre-orders because that will be one of the biggest tellings as to how popular the ps3 really is.

220
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing is a lot of the news I've heard.

221
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,448
Speaker 1: I'm not it's not a hundred percent.

222
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:37,270
Speaker 1: real news Is that like 80% of the ps3s are going to EB GameStops?

223
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:42,066
Speaker 1: And the rest of the like 20% are going to Best Buy circuit cities.

224
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:43,270
Speaker 1: Toys R Us is type places.

225
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:45,744
Speaker 0: I think the real stat here is that 90% are going to eBay.

226
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,766
Speaker 0: Now to say something that I said a whole bunch of times today.

227
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:52,730
Speaker 0: It's been my thing today.

228
00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:05,143
Speaker 0: I mean I get into little bits and I've been saying this over and over All right Totally got interrupted but uh by it by a ricer who just drove by and perhaps the stupidest rice car I've ever seen or heard the stupidest rice car I've ever seen.

229
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:06,670
Speaker 0: It's the stupidest rice car I've ever heard.

230
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:13,237
Speaker 0: I mean, I've never heard a rice car that sounded stupider than that and I've heard some stupid glass packs before but For what?

231
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:19,803
Speaker 0: I was about to say before I get interrupted I would have said the exact same thing to that ricer all day today.

232
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:22,109
Speaker 0: I've been saying whatever dude

233
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:23,694
Speaker 1: Whatever dude

234
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:36,050
Speaker 0: and that's what I got to say to the people who are gonna stand in line to get the pre-order So that they can then stand in line and possibly get a PlayStation 3 on launch for $600 plus tax plus two controllers plus a game.

235
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,392
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Mean.

236
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:47,744
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say the ps3 is a shit system because it's a pretty powerful thing, but Getting one at launch is pretty much a losing proposition.

237
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:54,138
Speaker 1: No matter how you look at it Unless you're real lucky and you score big on eBay Yeah, I don't then go for it by all means.

238
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:57,930
Speaker 1: or if you're wicked rich like if you're loaded uncle money bags.

239
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're loaded and you're bored, there's no reason not to get a ps3.

240
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:05,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like a great way to spend your money, but seriously buy an Xbox.

241
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:11,770
Speaker 0: Well think there's one Two years from now when it's a lot cheaper and the good games come out.

242
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:13,855
Speaker 1: This one interesting thing.

243
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:25,831
Speaker 1: Is that a gamestop spokesman said that while the sellout wasn't confirmed until 2 p.m They said that it was a matter of minutes at most stores, which was a faster sellout rate than the 360.

244
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:29,926
Speaker 1: But that might be because there are more 360s but sellout rate.

245
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,010
Speaker 1: He's not very specific.

246
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:39,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, well it also might be that anyone who wants a ps3 and there's probably more than two million people who want a ps3 Regardless of whether or not they can afford it.

247
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:44,010
Speaker 0: They probably knew that they wouldn't get one unless they acted crazily.

248
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:48,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's just that It for the 360.

249
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:50,445
Speaker 1: It's sort of just like a general gamer.

250
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:51,870
Speaker 1: good feelings, you know.

251
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,521
Speaker 1: And for the Wii there's some craziness and also some gamer good feelings.

252
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:56,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the ps3.

253
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:58,089
Speaker 1: it's pretty much either.

254
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,135
Speaker 1: Wow, this is stupid.

255
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,299
Speaker 1: screw that shit.

256
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,718
Speaker 1: if because if you're a general gamer, you're not gonna have good feelings for the ps3 So it's only crazies.

257
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,663
Speaker 1: It's own.

258
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:08,607
Speaker 1: It's mostly ps3.

259
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:08,787
Speaker 1: crazy.

260
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:13,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz pretty much any reasonable person because I wouldn't mind getting a ps3.

261
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:14,109
Speaker 0: I wouldn't mind having one.

262
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:20,214
Speaker 1: I mean if it weren't that much money if you put one if you came up to the door and said here's a ps3 I'd be like, thank you, sir.

263
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:34,178
Speaker 0: And if the ps3 say it were like, you know, three or four hundred bucks I might I mean it would have been on the list of possibilities if I had money line or if I had an HDTV be higher on the list, but Goddamn got them.

264
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:34,761
Speaker 1: Right?

265
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,410
Speaker 0: All I want is I want it.

266
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:36,891
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna.

267
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:41,704
Speaker 0: I'm gonna reserve all my judgment until the Wii pre-orders really come.

268
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:42,967
Speaker 0: cuz that's soon.

Speaker 0: Yeah I mean gig nights ahead of the game.

273
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:57,630
Speaker 0: We got a Wii pre-order a while ago at the Nintendo World Store.

274
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, the most confirmed.

275
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:01,003
Speaker 0: we are so guaranteed to get a Wii.

276
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:02,168
Speaker 0: It's pretty much like me.

277
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:08,030
Speaker 1: Oh, no Not only am I getting a Wii there's a good chance like Reggie will personally hand me my Wii.

278
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:11,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I can you imagine what it's gonna go down at the Nintendo store?

279
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:15,760
Speaker 1: It's gonna be some craziness full reports from geek nights in 40 days.

282
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:35,126
Speaker 0: Cuz I'll bet that the ps3 and the Wii will both sell out Maybe and that means a very different thing to Sony as it does to Nintendo.

283
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:37,979
Speaker 1: It doesn't be All right.

284
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:48,729
Speaker 0: Anyway things of the day dinner dinner.

285
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:57,190
Speaker 0: You think I should sit down with a bunch of effects and make a radio kind of you know Things of the day with a lot of reverb and echo and lasers in the background and shit.

286
00:18:57,332 --> 00:18:58,190
Speaker 1: We should do that eventually.

287
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,676
Speaker 0: What do you guys think?

288
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:00,702
Speaker 0: is that a good idea or not?

289
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:02,010
Speaker 1: I think it's an awesome idea.

290
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,748
Speaker 1: It's much better than hearing you say things of the day than hearing me go doo doo doo doo doo doo.

291
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:08,018
Speaker 0: Yep We have this dynamic here.

292
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,440
Speaker 0: Yeah.

293
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:10,449
Speaker 0: All right thing of the day here.

294
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:17,797
Speaker 0: so I was playing bionic commando as I've been talking about and I was real good at that game as a kid and I got better at it.

295
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:23,280
Speaker 0: and on the way to CityCon I beat it and killed Hitler twice in the car.

296
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:24,744
Speaker 1: You can't kill two Hitler.

297
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:25,987
Speaker 0: We can't kill two Hitler's.

298
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:30,504
Speaker 0: I then killed Hitler like four more times at the con.

299
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:31,408
Speaker 1: kill six Hitler's.

300
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:41,024
Speaker 0: and Not only did I find a couple speed runs of bionic commando But I learned a way to beat the game a lot quicker that I didn't realize.

301
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:43,010
Speaker 1: you can't beat bionic commando ten minutes.

302
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,510
Speaker 0: So I'm linking to two speed runs.

303
00:19:46,011 --> 00:20:00,509
Speaker 0: The first speedrun is not machine assisted is a straight-up guy playing the game all the way through American version speedrun and It is pretty much a video of almost exactly how I play bionic commando.

304
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:06,410
Speaker 0: I mean I was following along watching it with my fingers and it's pretty much straight up how I play the game.

305
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:12,549
Speaker 0: Except there's a couple of places where he did things I didn't think to do and there's a couple of places where he fucks up and I could have done it better.

306
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:16,829
Speaker 1: That's pretty typical yeah, but I mean what about the other speed run?

307
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:22,429
Speaker 0: you go All right, the other speed runs of the Japanese version of the game, which is easier and harder.

308
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,181
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah gonna be easier and hard in one level like I see him going.

309
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:27,928
Speaker 0: and there's these platforms that weren't there before.

310
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:29,937
Speaker 0: they make it a Fuck shit ton easy.

311
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:31,526
Speaker 1: Are you sure there aren't platforms of death?

312
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:32,209
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm sure.

313
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:42,590
Speaker 0: But yet then there's this like wall of spikes that comes out of nowhere and all these extra guys And there's changes to the game that I don't even know why they bothered because they like they took stuff out of the game.

314
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:43,982
Speaker 0: There's nothing to do with anything.

315
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:48,699
Speaker 0: No It's weird, but all right, that's a fucking speedrun.

316
00:20:48,860 --> 00:21:01,310
Speaker 0: I can't play the game like the second speedrun, but I'm gonna try Okay, because I think I'll be able to do that someday Mmm, so my thing of the day is yet another funny video from College Humor.

317
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,651
Speaker 1: You like.

318
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:02,696
Speaker 0: this is fucking a Larry.

319
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:05,187
Speaker 1: College Humor is coming out with the funny videos lately.

320
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:05,830
Speaker 1: way to go guys.

321
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,437
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there that Street Fighter 2 thing.

322
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:12,216
Speaker 1: We just talked about and yeah, so now they've got this Rejected Wii games.

323
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:14,343
Speaker 1: it says the upcoming Nintendo Wii.

324
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:29,900
Speaker 1: we use a revolutionary new controller which won't be used for any of the following and it's basically a video of a bunch of people with a normal remote control that they're pretending as a Wii controller and They're acting as if they're playing Wii games that don't exist.

325
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,450
Speaker 1: Like the first guy is flipping burgers at McDonald's.

326
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,176
Speaker 0: It's called five dollars an hour.

327
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:36,521
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he's.

328
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,368
Speaker 1: he acts like he's working at McDonald's.

329
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:43,399
Speaker 0: now The video is hilarious Spoilers cuz whatever but my favorite one.

330
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,084
Speaker 0: it's called hot hands.

331
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,247
Speaker 0: No hot hands is good.

332
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,170
Speaker 0: You remember hot hands?

333
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,530
Speaker 0: It's hard to describe as the slap.

334
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,050
Speaker 1: It's the game where you try to slap the other guys hands the game that no one ever really played so much.

335
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:55,961
Speaker 0: It was just kind of like in movies.

336
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:56,685
Speaker 0: It was there a lot.

337
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:57,510
Speaker 1: Oh, I play that game.

338
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:00,439
Speaker 0: It's always just like a big kid picking on a little something.

339
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:01,161
Speaker 1: gotta make mercy.

340
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:02,104
Speaker 0: We mercy.

341
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:04,090
Speaker 1: we gotta make mercy for the way.

342
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:08,410
Speaker 0: Why don't they make like schoolyard games for the Wii and have a million stupid games like that?

343
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,875
Speaker 1: It'll be a backyard baseball.

344
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,139
Speaker 1: I'm sure will eventually come out.

345
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,944
Speaker 1: Yes a popular one.

346
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:14,509
Speaker 0: It's like Nazi something.

347
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:25,739
Speaker 0: So it's just like you hear all this Hitler stuff like Hitler giving a speech and then when the crowd goes they Kyle the kid Holds the Wii controller like zig heil zig heil And then it's like thing.

348
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,222
Speaker 1: Perfect.

349
00:22:26,383 --> 00:22:30,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other one is The one the guy does hara-kiri with the.

350
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,288
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like seppuku and that would be a cool game.

351
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:37,670
Speaker 1: kind of Make sure you kill yourself properly with this Wii controller.

352
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:41,545
Speaker 0: I have anything I would make a samurai game where there is a seppuku minigame.

353
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:50,794
Speaker 0: Haha, or maybe Or if you just lose you got to commit seppuku and you can get a but like you get a bunch of points for committing Seppuku properly.

354
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:55,070
Speaker 1: so at the end of the game should have a game where you yuck as a boss and you chop fingers off.

355
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:56,149
Speaker 0: Let that finger fly.

356
00:22:57,531 --> 00:23:02,050
Speaker 0: But imagine this you're playing this yacht this like samurai game and you can just get killed.

357
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:08,895
Speaker 0: But the best way to win is get as far as you can and then instead of dying you commit seppuku Before someone kills you.

358
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:12,269
Speaker 0: but you got to do it right and you get a crazy bonus if you do it properly.

359
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:16,127
Speaker 1: Should we let people in on the let that finger fly joke?

360
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:20,529
Speaker 0: All right I don't remember how to say it in Japanese, but I learned it once because I thought it was really funny.

361
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:33,030
Speaker 0: but apparently and this is an all old Yakuza manga and Gekiga and Yakuza anime if You piss off the Yakuza Lord, you know a lot of movies They show like Yakuza guys have fingers missing.

362
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:37,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, now a lot of people thought that that was just like Oh Yakuza guys have a finger missing.

363
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:42,450
Speaker 0: No, if your finger got cut off that means that you did something stupid and they punished you.

364
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,541
Speaker 1: Usually, you know in Yakuza movies.

365
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:52,955
Speaker 1: It'll be you did something stupid and You would cut off your finger and then offer it to the Yakuza boss like I'm sorry finger.

366
00:23:53,136 --> 00:24:05,561
Speaker 0: or sometimes the Yakuza boss turns to you and basically says let that finger fly which means Goddamnit, yep, so he'd either order you to cut it off or apparently nowadays They'll just say it and it's it.

367
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,410
Speaker 0: they don't actually want you to cut your finger off.

368
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,084
Speaker 0: It's more of a wow, you did something stupid.

369
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:14,370
Speaker 1: Yeah So if you're a Yakuza and you screw up someone to be like let that finger fly now.

370
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:21,568
Speaker 0: I might be totally wrong here But from what we've gathered it seems that the origin of the Yakuza finger thing comes from way back feudal Japan.

371
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:22,230
Speaker 0: where?

372
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:29,209
Speaker 0: For various reasons a swordsman's pinky finger would be cut off thus making him a much less effective swordsman.

373
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:35,050
Speaker 0: I'm sure our friend Katsu can tell us whether or not the pinky finger is critical to wielding a sword.

374
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,064
Speaker 1: I'm think it would be don't you?

375
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:37,909
Speaker 0: I think so.

376
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:44,819
Speaker 0: Well, that's why I want to ask Katsu cuz I mean he kicked that guy's ass at Otakon Yeah, and he's really good at Kendo.

377
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,225
Speaker 0: So I'm sure he knows anyway.

378
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,330
Speaker 1: funny Wii game video.

379
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:49,269
Speaker 1: It's really funny.

380
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:56,390
Speaker 1: You want to watch this, you know and from the in the future just go to College Humor and watch their videos cuz they're funny.

381
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:59,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not gonna use those as things today anymore unless they're crazy.

382
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:04,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll stick with the ever popular You goog or goog tube.

383
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,372
Speaker 0: I like goo - goo - goo - goo - All right.

384
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,522
Speaker 0: So today well actually two days ago.

385
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:16,929
Speaker 0: We were talking about what to do the show on and we decided let's just pick any old game and do it like some old game we both play.

386
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:25,490
Speaker 0: and Then today on a whim I whipped out the Atari 7800 and my giant shoebox full of games and the four new games you just bought.

387
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:31,131
Speaker 0: Yeah, we bought a bunch of games for the Atari original cartridges recently at a video game store Uh-huh.

388
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:36,366
Speaker 0: So we bought a ice hockey because I didn't own it warlord because my copy didn't.

389
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:41,330
Speaker 0: my copy didn't work anymore Yars revenge because I never actually played it and God that game is stupid.

390
00:25:43,562 --> 00:25:45,786
Speaker 0: Anyway These games and we started playing it.

391
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:53,358
Speaker 1: I thought we'd review a whole bunch of Atari games because and describe some of them and how they work because a lot of people Don't understand a lot of.

392
00:25:53,398 --> 00:26:00,890
Speaker 0: I mean in a lot of ways Video gaming hasn't come that far And in other ways it's come a million million miles.

393
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:15,858
Speaker 0: Yeah But like compare there are Atari games that are better like hands-down Objectively better games than a lot of the Super Nintendo games that came out the like mountain bike whatever it's like whatever god I'd rather play the yards revenge daily.

394
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:18,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know ever have to play that fucker again.

395
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:24,276
Speaker 0: The other thing I'd like to point out is that Scott's going to make a whole bunch of stink about this But god damn it does.

396
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,026
Speaker 0: he suck at Atari you suck.

397
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:26,709
Speaker 1: What are you telling me?

398
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,039
Speaker 0: All right Do we have to list all?

399
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:38,173
Speaker 1: because I'm using the Atari 7800 has the shit joysticks that no other game system has had the like of ever and They're really.

400
00:26:38,394 --> 00:26:43,152
Speaker 1: the only reason that you can use those things is because you use them when you were a kid and you've been using them For years.

401
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:47,130
Speaker 1: nobody else who's never used them before can manage them.

402
00:26:47,592 --> 00:26:51,270
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go get a Sega Genesis controller and then you'll see that I don't suck at these games.

403
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,602
Speaker 1: I just suck with the shitty 7800 controllers.

404
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,255
Speaker 0: Yeah We'll see cuz you were it.

405
00:26:55,355 --> 00:27:01,135
Speaker 0: I mean you were making tactical mistakes in a lot of these games not just what ever Like the maze game.

406
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:02,741
Speaker 0: You just don't know what your way around mazes.

407
00:27:02,861 --> 00:27:04,547
Speaker 1: Oh, well screw that stupid maze game.

408
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,856
Speaker 0: All right It's a sign of intelligence.

409
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,021
Speaker 0: You just can't follow a man.

410
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:13,761
Speaker 1: I could I just kept going on the wrong way because I could have followed the maze.

411
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:19,030
Speaker 1: I just kept going though cuz the stupid joystick I would make a right turn and the guy would keep going straight into the dead end.

412
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,063
Speaker 1: I had to turn around then he go too far and I had to turn around again.

413
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,610
Speaker 0: You have no manual dexterity.

414
00:27:23,712 --> 00:27:29,117
Speaker 1: I have plenty of manual dexterity Just is mostly in my thumbs and not for a shit Joystick that I mean.

415
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:30,483
Speaker 1: I could use a joystick.

416
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:37,327
Speaker 1: if you give me a Street Fighter 2 joystick I'm all good, but you keep saying that the Atari 2600s joystick is superior.

417
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:38,512
Speaker 1: It is superior I don't.

418
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:38,834
Speaker 0: I think.

419
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:42,009
Speaker 0: if you use it again, you'll realize that they're pretty much the same.

420
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:44,098
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.

421
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,544
Speaker 1: It's a. it's not purpose.

422
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:46,227
Speaker 1: Regardless.

423
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:49,109
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter I'm getting a Genesis controller next time I go to my house.

424
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:51,700
Speaker 0: So the first game we played was a game I hadn't played.

425
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,230
Speaker 1: cuz if you didn't know you can use a Genesis controller on an Atari.

426
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:55,897
Speaker 0: Yes, they're the same connector and everything.

427
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:57,583
Speaker 0: Yep, even though most the buttons don't work.

428
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,149
Speaker 1: I only need one button.

429
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:02,001
Speaker 0: Uh at 7800 games you need two buttons.

430
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:03,708
Speaker 1: a Genesis controller has three buttons.

431
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,709
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you'll have to figure out which button is what a and B. All right.

432
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:13,559
Speaker 0: So we're gonna review a whole bunch of Atari 2600 and 7800 games starting with.

433
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,723
Speaker 0: we'll go pretty much in the order.

434
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:15,265
Speaker 0: We played them.

435
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:19,002
Speaker 1: ice hockey You know, it wasn't so bad.

436
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,410
Speaker 1: It was from Activision by the way.

437
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:27,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, this game is not as good as the Nintendo version of ice hockey Which I consider to be the best hockey game ever made.

438
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:30,890
Speaker 0: I agree, but it was actually pretty good.

439
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:35,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, you think you figure an ice hockey game for the Atari be kind of crummy, but it really isn't so bad.

440
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,390
Speaker 1: The only thing that's really bad about it is that you have two guys on the ice.

441
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:46,890
Speaker 1: you know one guy is sort of at the top and one guy sort of at the bottom and Moving the stick moves the guy who is closest to the puck.

442
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:53,870
Speaker 1: So if the puck is up at the top of the ice then the guy on the top you can move and the guy In the bottom, you can't control it all.

443
00:28:54,352 --> 00:29:01,990
Speaker 1: So, you know, I kept wanting to move the guy at the bottom of the ice closer to the goal But I couldn't because I could only move the guy at the top and that was annoying.

444
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:04,930
Speaker 1: But other than that the ice hockey game was pretty good.

445
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,739
Speaker 1: You know your guy gets the puck you skate around you shoot.

446
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:08,642
Speaker 1: it's pretty much.

447
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:13,029
Speaker 1: all you can do is shoot with in a direction Yeah, or you can knock the other guy down.

448
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:13,794
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can.

449
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:16,790
Speaker 1: you can push the button a whole lot to mess with the other guy when you're on defense.

450
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:18,436
Speaker 0: Yep, Scott ended up beating me.

451
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:19,379
Speaker 0: I think ten to six.

452
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:20,303
Speaker 0: Whoo.

453
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:22,130
Speaker 0: It was a pretty stunning victory on Scott's.

454
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:22,836
Speaker 1: I'm good at them.

455
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:23,624
Speaker 1: ice hockey games.

456
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:30,605
Speaker 0: Let me tell you Yeah Even though I beat you the last time we played NES ice hockey and this is with the shitty 7800 controller I could still play ice hockey because there wasn't much to this game.

457
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,390
Speaker 0: It moved real slow.

458
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,598
Speaker 0: We were playing on the fast advanced setting.

459
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was still pretty fun.

460
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:36,690
Speaker 1: Like I would play it some more.

461
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:50,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the other thing is ice hockey is one of the earlier Atari games because the Atari like every other system Progress quite a bit as it went on and older games were not as good as games that came out late in the Atari's Lifecycle were much more.

462
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:59,045
Speaker 1: It's like Mario 3 compared to Mario 1 Yeah, or like urban champions urban champions compared to Zelda 2.

463
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:01,332
Speaker 0: Yeah star tropics Exactly.

464
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:08,601
Speaker 0: All right, so then we played warlords, which is pretty much the iconic Multiplayer Atari game.

465
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:09,264
Speaker 1: It's.

466
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:10,290
Speaker 1: it's a great game.

467
00:30:10,813 --> 00:30:19,262
Speaker 1: I think it's unique for the Atari and that is a fast-paced smooth paddle controlled Four-player directly versus game.

468
00:30:19,523 --> 00:30:21,050
Speaker 0: Yeah straight up four player.

469
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:33,163
Speaker 0: it's basically four player breakout where each person in the corner has a castle and Knights that moves around the outside and a dragon breathes a fireball and the fire.

470
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:40,485
Speaker 1: the Knights bounce the fireball against each other and Hit each other's castles and then if the fireball gets into your castle you die.

471
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:41,870
Speaker 0: we played two-player.

472
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:43,420
Speaker 0: I beat Scott the first time.

473
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:44,850
Speaker 0: he beat me the second time.

474
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,202
Speaker 1: I'm actually good at warlords and I can use any paddle games I can.

475
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:49,065
Speaker 1: I can do so.

476
00:30:49,106 --> 00:31:00,610
Speaker 0: then we tried to play with Alex And we learned that my Atari which is old as fucker Can't the second port can't support the multiplayer paddles anymore so we can only play two-player games.

477
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:03,160
Speaker 1: Or maybe we need to flick some switches or who knows what.

478
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,727
Speaker 1: but yeah, it just didn't work.

479
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:05,510
Speaker 1: it was unhappy.

480
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:06,618
Speaker 0: Yeah game has issues.

481
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,390
Speaker 0: Mmm warlord is a good game.

482
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:16,130
Speaker 0: I mean it has issues just for the fact that it's an old Atari game But that is one of the earliest four-player games.

483
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,697
Speaker 0: That wasn't just as.

484
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:28,170
Speaker 1: if you want to play a new good version of warlords I don't want to recommend this game, but the retro Atari compilation for the DS It's not really that great.

485
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:32,521
Speaker 1: It's more like some guy Practice DS coding by making implementing a bunch of it.

486
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:35,150
Speaker 0: don't buy it unless you see it for five bucks or less.

487
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,711
Speaker 1: Yeah, I spent like 15 no a 10 on it I think.

488
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:44,950
Speaker 1: but yeah, it has warlords so you can try warlords out with that and it's an okay version of warlords.

489
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:48,161
Speaker 0: So then we played slot racer, which is a game.

490
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:50,690
Speaker 0: I used to love as a kid even though it's real hard.

491
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:53,689
Speaker 1: It's real hard and complicated and obtuse.

492
00:31:54,211 --> 00:32:04,329
Speaker 0: yeah, once you figure out what's going on see slot racers the game where you have these vehicles that move around and The controls are intuitive, but they're not obvious.

493
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:13,255
Speaker 0: like once you figure it out you're like, oh and then you have a lot of control over the game and it's really just a Game of being able to.

494
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:14,740
Speaker 0: I mean Atari games are simple.

495
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,523
Speaker 0: They're blocks.

496
00:32:15,964 --> 00:32:17,730
Speaker 0: It's usually blocks moving around.

497
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,639
Speaker 0: The controls are real.

498
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,790
Speaker 0: simply got one button in an eight-way joystick.

499
00:32:22,772 --> 00:32:26,649
Speaker 0: So the skills involved tend to come down to straight up.

500
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:32,510
Speaker 0: I hand coordination pattern recognition movement prediction better joysticks.

501
00:32:33,132 --> 00:32:43,430
Speaker 0: so in terms of this game the game is basically trying to predict where the other person will go and Creating a path for your projectile that will hit him while avoiding his projectile.

502
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:45,796
Speaker 0: And you like basically you program.

503
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:47,181
Speaker 0: it sounds like a lot.

504
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:50,412
Speaker 0: it's a lot of guitar games were really complex even though you had such Simple controls.

505
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:53,463
Speaker 0: you're driving around controlling your vehicle simultaneously.

506
00:32:53,483 --> 00:33:01,570
Speaker 0: You shoot projectiles and Effectively program them with simple logic to move around and you try to get them to hit the opponent.

507
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:04,537
Speaker 0: Scott couldn't play the game at all.

508
00:33:04,557 --> 00:33:07,990
Speaker 0: I beat him handily a bunch of times, but I never played the game.

509
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:13,443
Speaker 0: I can't blame you because the game is real difficult to be good at it's really.

510
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,310
Speaker 1: I couldn't see many people liking this game.

511
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:21,010
Speaker 0: I love that game me my brother and my dad and all my friends played it constantly and I'm real good at it.

512
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:21,827
Speaker 0: And so we're all of them.

513
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:25,970
Speaker 1: I think if you tried to make a game like that today people would be like fuck this shit and throw it out.

514
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:29,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, you kids have no patience for actual difficult game.

515
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:31,943
Speaker 1: It's not worth it because it's not that fun.

516
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:37,930
Speaker 0: even once they're good at it Alright, so then we played maze craze, which is actually one of my favorite Atari games.

517
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:42,130
Speaker 0: It has a lot of different kinds of levels and basically you got a blue guy and a red guy.

518
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:57,075
Speaker 0: it's two player always and a maze and whoever gets the end of the maze first wins and Scott couldn't deal with the fact that it would be like one two three go with the maze appears and I immediately am running directly For the exit as fast as possible.

519
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:00,867
Speaker 1: I think you've memorized all the mazes, but they're actually random Scott.

520
00:34:01,128 --> 00:34:03,073
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever Whatever.

521
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:09,570
Speaker 1: no, they really my main problem is that like, you know I would start off pick a direction and go for it and then I would look to see if I was going the right way.

522
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,629
Speaker 0: That's what I did, but you always went the wrong way.

523
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:18,062
Speaker 1: Well, and then the other problem was that I would you know I'd be like turn left and my guy would go straight a little bit too far.

524
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:19,347
Speaker 1: then I have to turn around.

525
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,536
Speaker 1: I go too far You know, it was really hard to.

526
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:24,469
Speaker 1: I don't know why you have so much ice with the joys.

527
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,201
Speaker 0: I don't know why you have so much trouble with this joystick.

528
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:27,650
Speaker 0: I find it to be incredibly precise.

529
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,761
Speaker 0: The thing is it's not a joystick and don't treat it as such.

530
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,409
Speaker 0: treat it as a d-pad with a stick coming out of it.

531
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,695
Speaker 1: That's no good cuz.

532
00:34:34,815 --> 00:34:36,241
Speaker 0: I don't move it like a joystick.

533
00:34:36,322 --> 00:34:38,170
Speaker 0: I tap it left and right it up and down.

534
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:39,315
Speaker 1: I can't do that.

535
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:40,664
Speaker 1: I got a if it's a joystick.

536
00:34:40,684 --> 00:34:41,630
Speaker 1: I gotta hold it in one.

537
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,453
Speaker 0: I gotta hold it now I got maze.

538
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:46,608
Speaker 0: craze is a game that it was probably my favorite favorite favorite game.

539
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:48,676
Speaker 0: as a kid I played it constantly with my brother.

540
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:52,510
Speaker 0: It was like a battle of wits because it's not just a maze.

541
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,362
Speaker 0: I mean you can play where part of the maze is invisible.

542
00:34:54,463 --> 00:34:55,530
Speaker 0: all of the maze is invisible.

543
00:34:56,072 --> 00:35:10,630
Speaker 0: You can play one version where while you're running you can hit the button and Create a secret door where it looks like there's no path, but there is a path that confuse the other person Mm-hmm, and there are some modes where you have to collect three things that are moving around and then escape.

544
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:15,130
Speaker 0: There are modes where there are things moving around that kill you so you have to get out without being killed.

545
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:19,729
Speaker 0: The game is really really good and really really taxing on the brain.

546
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott's brain was a little overtaxed.

547
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:25,316
Speaker 1: No, not really.

548
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:26,785
Speaker 0: I beat him like ten times.

549
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:27,570
Speaker 0: then he just turned the game.

550
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,237
Speaker 1: I wasn't my brain that was over.

551
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:30,322
Speaker 1: text is my hand.

552
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:38,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, your manual dexterity though There were a couple times you just went the wrong way and then like because you were going fine And you you had this like you thought you're gonna win and then you stopped.

553
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:42,483
Speaker 0: you said Shit, you were in a dead end all by yourself.

554
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:44,976
Speaker 1: Yeah No good.

555
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:45,983
Speaker 0: It's a good game.

556
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:46,729
Speaker 0: I like it a lot.

557
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,313
Speaker 1: Yeah It would do.

558
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:50,080
Speaker 1: I would do better at it if it like.

559
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:55,829
Speaker 1: they showed you the maze and then they counted down from five And then you went instead of you go as soon as the maze appears.

560
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's a different kind of game.

561
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:02,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's more of a quick reactions game than a.

562
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:06,367
Speaker 1: I just want to look at the maze for even one second before I have to start moving.

563
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:07,090
Speaker 0: see well the game.

564
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,794
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

565
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:12,056
Speaker 0: if you wait and look then if I go the wrong way Automatically then you win.

566
00:36:12,277 --> 00:36:14,892
Speaker 1: as long as then if you went the right way, I'm screwed I have.

567
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:19,142
Speaker 1: the only way to do it is to do it the way you do it Where you go the right way right?

568
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:19,466
Speaker 1: Okay.

569
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:25,446
Speaker 0: Well, yeah Well, the game is the game of how quickly can you parse a very simple maze?

570
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:26,569
Speaker 0: Well, it's not that simple.

571
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:27,956
Speaker 1: actually They're pretty complex.

572
00:36:27,997 --> 00:36:29,970
Speaker 1: You can even make them even more complex in the higher levels.

573
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:36,689
Speaker 0: yeah, the one trick is that it's like all mazes there tends to be a Direction you want to go in and you can kind of get a feel for it.

574
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:40,930
Speaker 0: But it's definitely a game of how quickly can you parse a pattern and then implement it?

575
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:49,880
Speaker 1: The thing is like I don't even try to parse the maze because I have to start moving right away Arse and move at the same time and

576
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:57,669
Speaker 0: I'll often go the wrong way when Scott's real close to me on Purpose and then immediately duck out because he'll follow me and then run off into the dead end

577
00:36:58,532 --> 00:37:00,320
Speaker 1: It's because I can't control my guy.

578
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,610
Speaker 0: Hey, yeah, it's also just it's a good game.

579
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:08,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, then we played some 7800 games, which is the next iteration of the Atari.

580
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:10,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, the 800 was backward compatible.

581
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:19,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got the Atari 7800 is a system that can play Atari 2600 games But it can also play Atari 7800 games, which are almost as good as a Nintendo game.

582
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:32,201
Speaker 0: In fact Atari's well, they're almost as good as low-end Atari 7800 games have the capability to be on par almost straight up with non MMC meaning early NES games.

583
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:39,322
Speaker 1: Yeah Donkey Kong for the Atari 7800 is Basically 90% identical to Donkey Kong for the NES.

584
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:41,730
Speaker 0: Yep, and we played Donkey Kong.

585
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,704
Speaker 1: Don't care for the NES is still better, but I kicked Scott's ass.

586
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:48,004
Speaker 1: Well, I Frickin I don't know what the hell was going on there.

587
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:58,610
Speaker 1: But like I'm usually the master of Donkey Kong Well, not the grand master But I can usually beat like a few I can get Donkey Kong dead a few times before it's game over.

588
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,247
Speaker 0: Right now I'd give you the controller thing because you have trouble with the controller.

589
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:02,890
Speaker 0: I respect that.

590
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,630
Speaker 0: It's not that big a deal, but you made serious tactical errors.

591
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:12,055
Speaker 1: It's like you played level one and I watched you and I was like, yep That's exactly what I do.

592
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:14,747
Speaker 1: and I was watching it and that was how my brain processed.

593
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:15,370
Speaker 1: level of Donkey.

594
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:21,007
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then you and then I did it and like these are these barrels coming at me from other places I'm like, what the fuck?

595
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,057
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is like you went up ladders.

596
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:25,749
Speaker 0: that is dangerous to go up and then the barrel would come down and get you.

597
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:27,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what was going on.

598
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:27,941
Speaker 1: There was no good.

599
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:28,905
Speaker 0: Yes.

600
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:33,030
Speaker 0: I played through it for a while But I didn't make it past the second level because I did the Rama Sharma.

601
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:35,590
Speaker 0: I tried to do too much with you tried to do too much.

602
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:37,897
Speaker 0: I tried to get that stupid purse and that was the enemy.

603
00:38:37,957 --> 00:38:43,656
Speaker 1: never go for the stupid person level in - - It's always stupid to go for that.

604
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:45,907
Speaker 1: You just go kill Donkey Kong get your points.

605
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:51,666
Speaker 1: So then we played Donkey Kong jr Which is a game that I played in the arcade maybe two times ever.

606
00:38:51,686 --> 00:38:55,037
Speaker 1: Yeah All I remember is the one where Donkey Kong jr.

607
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:59,288
Speaker 1: Tries to save Donkey Kong from Mario and he goes on vines.

608
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,677
Speaker 0: Yep, it's actually a really good game.

609
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:03,725
Speaker 0: I mean, it's I'd say it's on par with Donkey Kong.

610
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,774
Speaker 0: No, not really I think it is.

611
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,382
Speaker 1: No, it's been dying.

612
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:12,830
Speaker 0: Kong 3 God Yeah, but this I kick Scott.

613
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:19,586
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna keep hammering this but Scott was like he watched me play and I like bust through the game like crazy and I can't.

614
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:29,237
Speaker 0: I save doggy on a bunch Of time I finally die and I even did crazy stunts Like I jumped on things you can't jump on to and glitch the game to get even further Mmm, and then Scott starts.

615
00:39:29,258 --> 00:39:36,270
Speaker 0: he dies like immediately like he climbs up the first vine And then he falls to his death and then he climbs up the first line to the exact same spot.

616
00:39:36,672 --> 00:39:38,721
Speaker 0: It falls to his death in the exact same way.

617
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:40,349
Speaker 1: It's it wasn't fun.

618
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:41,873
Speaker 0: No, it was.

619
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:42,677
Speaker 1: it's not a good game.

620
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:43,721
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good game.

621
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,590
Speaker 0: No, it's not gonna cuz you're not good at it.

622
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,350
Speaker 1: No, it's really just not a good game.

623
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:50,389
Speaker 0: Well when I was a kid, actually I sucked ass at that game and I hated it.

624
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:52,880
Speaker 0: Now that I'm a better gamer and I'm older.

625
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,723
Speaker 0: I like it a lot more.

626
00:39:53,743 --> 00:39:55,873
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Got.

627
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:56,618
Speaker 0: after that we play.

628
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:58,369
Speaker 0: Oh, we can skip some of these games.

629
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:03,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, just talk about whichever games, you know you bring up the game and I'll talk about it.

630
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:07,783
Speaker 1: All right, of course Outlaw Outlaw is actually one of my favorite Atari games.

631
00:40:08,044 --> 00:40:09,850
Speaker 1: You got to understand the awesomeness of this game.

632
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,526
Speaker 0: It's two stick figure cowboys shooting at each other with pixel guns.

633
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:20,350
Speaker 0: Yeehaw Like a cactus in the middle or stagecoaches going by and the game is so simple.

634
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:28,499
Speaker 0: it is straight up just a competition of bluffing and It's really just bluffing once everyone's good at it.

635
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,070
Speaker 0: bluffing and I hand coordination and calculating angles.

636
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:47,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you can really only shoot bullets at 45 degree angles or zero degree angles And you got a cowboy on the left and a cowboy on the right and one guy shoots to the right and the other guy shoots to the left and in between You can choose to either have a cactus which is invincible.

637
00:40:47,582 --> 00:40:49,789
Speaker 1: You can choose to have a stagecoach.

638
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:59,075
Speaker 0: Well, no, no You can have a cactus that's invincible with unlimited ammo a cactus that cactus that's invincible with limited ammo a cactus That's not invincible with unlimited ammo.

639
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:02,284
Speaker 0: Okay, every variation has limited and unlimited ammo.

640
00:41:02,485 --> 00:41:03,668
Speaker 0: Yeah stagecoach.

641
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:04,892
Speaker 0: That's invincible That isn't.

642
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:06,256
Speaker 0: that's moving and invincible.

643
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,521
Speaker 0: That's moving and not invincible.

644
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:10,069
Speaker 0: a wall a wall that's moving a wall that's moving.

645
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:17,330
Speaker 1: and Yeah, there's a whole bunch of different combinations in case you get bored of the invincible cactus mode.

646
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:21,650
Speaker 1: But now, of course you get the bouncing bullets the non bouncing bullets.

647
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:23,835
Speaker 1: You know, it's all good.

648
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,142
Speaker 0: I beat Scott every time.

649
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:27,065
Speaker 1: No, you didn't get it.

650
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:29,095
Speaker 1: I beat you many times infinite Am?

651
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:29,685
Speaker 1: I beat you?

652
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:31,652
Speaker 1: I beat Once.

653
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:32,053
Speaker 0: you beat me.

654
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,358
Speaker 1: I beat you a couple times.

655
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,024
Speaker 0: No, you killed me a couple times.

656
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:36,550
Speaker 1: I think I beat you twice.

657
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:37,978
Speaker 0: No, you beat me one.

658
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:41,279
Speaker 1: I've ever beaten you twice and one of those stagecoaches I think I didn't.

659
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,429
Speaker 1: I beat you on the bouncing cactus.

660
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:50,703
Speaker 0: You beat me on the second round we played which was unlimited ammo bouncing cactus Whatever and you beat me pretty thoroughly there, but I beat you everywhere else.

661
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:51,365
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

662
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:52,168
Speaker 1: I'm good at outlaw.

663
00:41:52,188 --> 00:41:53,780
Speaker 0: No, you're not All right.

664
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:58,050
Speaker 0: combat Combat is a great game.

665
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:07,189
Speaker 0: It's the same thing as outlaw almost only with little tanks little tanks and airplanes and you move around and it has modes like you Can only beat the guy if you hit him with a reflected shot and stuff like that.

666
00:42:07,812 --> 00:42:10,850
Speaker 0: My favorite mode is invisible mode where it's just a blank screen.

667
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:15,262
Speaker 0: There's two tanks and you're both invisible and when you shoot you appear for a second.

668
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,870
Speaker 0: and I got to admit it was funny.

669
00:42:18,192 --> 00:42:20,850
Speaker 0: Cuz we're both invisible and Scott's like how am I supposed to do this?

670
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:25,777
Speaker 1: And I shot it cuz I used to be able to do invisible tank when I was a kid But now I can't freaking do that.

671
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:26,902
Speaker 0: Oh, where the fuck?

672
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:27,183
Speaker 0: how'd you?

673
00:42:27,203 --> 00:42:30,479
Speaker 0: and I shot him again and I shot him again And I shot him again when I was invisible.

674
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:31,585
Speaker 1: He shot me.

675
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:35,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Scott I mean, I don't even know where I am, but somehow he's shooting me.

676
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:38,690
Speaker 0: See I had an Atari and I played it a lot.

677
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,830
Speaker 1: In fact, I played my see I had an Atari but when I was three it broke.

678
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,443
Speaker 1: So I only really played Pac Man a bunch of times and broke breakout and then that was it.

679
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:49,710
Speaker 0: even after I got a Super Nintendo I played my Atari regularly.

680
00:42:50,011 --> 00:42:58,823
Speaker 1: Yeah, our Atari was gone by then so I didn't play it that long and I you know I played all those games but mostly at other people's houses and in the arcade and stuff like that.

681
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,789
Speaker 0: All right, Crystal Castle sucks ass.

682
00:43:01,653 --> 00:43:02,939
Speaker 1: It was kind of sucky.

683
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,230
Speaker 1: I'm good at it wasn't the worst thing ever though.

684
00:43:05,351 --> 00:43:12,670
Speaker 0: well, it's a. as a kid the game scared the hell out of me because it was all these monsters and They were all kind of scary and they'd come out.

685
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,525
Speaker 0: They weren't pretty scary and the game is just kind of hard.

686
00:43:15,565 --> 00:43:16,430
Speaker 0: and so you're a teddy bear.

687
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:20,184
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're a teddy bear and these like giant skeletons are coming to kill you.

688
00:43:20,204 --> 00:43:22,533
Speaker 1: The skeleton was awesome though He was.

689
00:43:22,573 --> 00:43:23,598
Speaker 0: you didn't get to see the ghosts.

690
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:24,703
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

691
00:43:24,724 --> 00:43:25,970
Speaker 1: I want to see the ghost.

692
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, like bees come and sting you to death.

693
00:43:28,537 --> 00:43:33,330
Speaker 1: It's sort of like Qbert in a way that you're trying to touch the whole board without getting killed by monsters.

694
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,317
Speaker 0: It's like a cross between Qbert and pac-man.

695
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:37,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sounds kind of weird.

696
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:40,073
Speaker 1: and there's also honey and Hats.

697
00:43:40,758 --> 00:43:42,329
Speaker 0: Yeah magic hats magic hats.

698
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:43,472
Speaker 0: Alright.

699
00:43:43,532 --> 00:43:44,977
Speaker 0: now the next game we played.

700
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,201
Speaker 0: Scott can't blame the controller.

701
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:47,205
Speaker 0: cuz cuz.

702
00:43:47,245 --> 00:43:48,670
Speaker 1: I'm actually really good at this game.

703
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,137
Speaker 0: Plus it's it's pitfall.

704
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:54,938
Speaker 0: Alright fucking pitfall no matter what controls you're using Unless your controller is physically broken.

705
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,010
Speaker 0: The skill of pitfall is purely the skill of playing pitfall.

706
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,581
Speaker 1: It's just right left and pushing a button now.

707
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:02,409
Speaker 0: Scott talked a big game.

708
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:04,898
Speaker 1: Scott and I came out with a big game.

709
00:44:05,058 --> 00:44:08,690
Speaker 0: Scott talked a big game and I did real good.

710
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:10,463
Speaker 1: I got two freaking treasures, man.

711
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:16,210
Speaker 0: I Got three past a fourth one and could have kept going but killed myself on purpose.

712
00:44:16,672 --> 00:44:18,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's only cuz you went.

713
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:23,378
Speaker 1: second if you would have let you didn't then you turn the game off and if you gave If I had another try I would have gotten five treasures.

714
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:24,162
Speaker 0: I doubt it.

715
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:25,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna beat pitfall.

716
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:29,170
Speaker 0: you watch The point out that Scott talked a really big game.

717
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,750
Speaker 0: I mean, I can't make fun of him for losing it like kaboom because I'm Tommy at kaboom.

718
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:36,280
Speaker 1: I did pretty good at kaboom for not being Tommy.

719
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:37,224
Speaker 0: Yeah, he did really good.

720
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:40,259
Speaker 0: But me well well That's a paddle game.

721
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:42,210
Speaker 0: I can play that I can't make funny for the other games.

722
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:46,330
Speaker 0: But you've talked a big fucking game for pitfall and I came out with a big game.

723
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,495
Speaker 1: But it was the first try.

724
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:51,470
Speaker 1: and how many years you knew you'd only let me try it once one try.

725
00:44:51,551 --> 00:44:52,337
Speaker 1: That was pretty good.

726
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:53,969
Speaker 0: It had been equally many years for me.

727
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you got to watch me play first.

728
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:59,630
Speaker 1: you got to see which boards are where I didn't matter.

729
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,794
Speaker 0: It's the same every time.

730
00:45:00,835 --> 00:45:02,421
Speaker 0: I have that game practically memorized.

731
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:04,890
Speaker 1: see that's that's not fair because I don't have it memorized.

732
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:09,935
Speaker 1: I just memorize how to do each kind of board, but uh It's the same game everywhere.

733
00:45:09,955 --> 00:45:10,837
Speaker 1: No, it's it.

734
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:16,151
Speaker 0: I don't memorize pitfall you I memorized it in terms of I know where all the treasures Are.

735
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,658
Speaker 1: I don't know where the treasures are.

736
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:20,049
Speaker 1: I just keep going and trying to get until I get them all.

737
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:24,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, you talk a big game and then I don't have a big game at pitfall.

738
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:27,597
Speaker 0: I'm great at it didn't even break 10,000. that's cuz.

739
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:32,296
Speaker 1: it was the first time I played in years first time I played in years But you knew the game still.

740
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:34,143
Speaker 0: so why would you talk a big game?

741
00:45:34,223 --> 00:45:39,002
Speaker 0: if I know the game and I'm good at it You're not good because I am good at it, but you sucked at.

742
00:45:39,022 --> 00:45:40,106
Speaker 1: I just don't have memorized.

743
00:45:40,126 --> 00:45:42,255
Speaker 1: and I did really well Not really.

744
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:46,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, really getting three treasures is nothing It's nothing.

745
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:47,899
Speaker 1: yeah next time I'll beat it.

746
00:45:47,939 --> 00:45:50,108
Speaker 1: you watch you'll see I could be pitfall.

747
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:53,661
Speaker 0: I'm just ragging on Scott because he's good.

748
00:45:53,681 --> 00:45:55,066
Speaker 0: I mean, he's really good at video games.

749
00:45:55,126 --> 00:45:56,250
Speaker 0: Just not at Atari.

750
00:45:56,432 --> 00:46:11,066
Speaker 1: I'm good at Atari games Super controller and I can't Frickin be expected to be amazing and kicking ass at a game that I haven't played that much in my life that I'm kind of Good at in one try the first try in years.

751
00:46:11,327 --> 00:46:15,570
Speaker 0: I'm fine I'll give you all that but you have to admit that I'm better than you at Atari games.

752
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:17,399
Speaker 1: You're only better than me.

753
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:26,937
Speaker 1: Hey at Certain games in the Atari 1700 because you played them for years of your life You can actually use that controller.

754
00:46:27,078 --> 00:46:28,382
Speaker 0: but uh, I suck at.

755
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:31,769
Speaker 0: you know, Mega Man 2 and the only reason you're good at it You played it a whole bunch.

756
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:34,823
Speaker 1: No, even if you played Mega Man 2 a whole bunch you wouldn't be as good as I am.

757
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:38,083
Speaker 0: I probably would no fine you.

758
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:41,359
Speaker 0: Which let's see who will win first.

759
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,230
Speaker 0: you beat bionic commando or I beat Mega Man 2.

760
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,299
Speaker 0: Does that have to be the competition?

761
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:46,508
Speaker 1: Mega Man 2 is an easier game?

762
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,656
Speaker 0: Bionic commando is really easy.

763
00:46:48,676 --> 00:46:49,419
Speaker 0: I don't know.

764
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:51,690
Speaker 1: I never really tried to get past the first level.

765
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,396
Speaker 0: You can borrow that Capcom mini-mix.

766
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:53,737
Speaker 0: I bought.

767
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:54,459
Speaker 1: I'll try.

768
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never actually tried to beat bionic commando at all.

769
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:01,273
Speaker 1: I kind of played it for a few minutes and then be like, okay Wow, yeah.

770
00:47:01,293 --> 00:47:01,995
Speaker 0: All right.

771
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:03,939
Speaker 0: So yards revenge is just terrible.

772
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:14,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's I don't know Atari guys are like, yeah yards revenge is like the awesome amazing Atari thing.

773
00:47:14,928 --> 00:47:21,730
Speaker 0: It's To quote what was used to see because I listened to like 10 of their episodes in the last week and one they're really cool.

774
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,158
Speaker 0: they're good podcast about movies.

775
00:47:23,198 --> 00:47:32,290
Speaker 0: a little plug here, but They you know They're British and they use British isms and they always say like when something's shitty like Americans say, oh, that's shitty.

776
00:47:32,572 --> 00:47:38,316
Speaker 0: They always say well, it's a bit shit It's a bit shit And it's grown on me.

777
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,682
Speaker 0: I like saying that it's a bit shit.

778
00:47:40,365 --> 00:47:41,149
Speaker 0: this game's a bit shit.

779
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:48,737
Speaker 0: See cuz I love they were making fun of American accents one day and I love hearing Non-americans do American accents.

780
00:47:49,038 --> 00:47:49,981
Speaker 0: So it's I love.

781
00:47:50,062 --> 00:47:52,630
Speaker 1: I also love hearing non-americans do American accent.

782
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:58,930
Speaker 0: So I hope you all enjoy hearing your accents done poorly even though like I know we have a lot of Australian listeners in there.

783
00:47:59,091 --> 00:48:01,876
Speaker 0: I can't do anything on a Crikey.

784
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:14,082
Speaker 0: Oh I'm sorry to Australia.

785
00:48:14,505 --> 00:48:15,290
Speaker 0: You guys are awesome.

786
00:48:15,631 --> 00:48:21,190
Speaker 0: In fact, I was talking to my grandpa today cuz he loves Australia and he spent like a month there, but I digress.

787
00:48:22,131 --> 00:48:26,390
Speaker 0: I don't think we're gonna talk about any more Atari games because I don't want to go long on an episode.

788
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:31,456
Speaker 0: We're just laughing at Scott about a target Happen at rain cuz.

789
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:33,749
Speaker 1: he played too many shitty Atari games.

790
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,536
Speaker 1: Only some of them are awesome.

791
00:48:36,576 --> 00:48:37,319
Speaker 1: Most of them are shit.

792
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,627
Speaker 1: They're a bit shit shit a bit.

793
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:43,922
Speaker 1: It's a bit You can't be a bit shit time Stan.

794
00:48:43,942 --> 00:48:46,574
Speaker 0: that was lame Whatever.

795
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:47,339
Speaker 0: All right.

796
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,830
Speaker 0: I think we're descending into silliness.

797
00:48:49,472 --> 00:49:02,164
Speaker 0: I'll end this by saying that if you can find an emulator and you're in any way a video game fan It behooves you to play all of the Atari games you can find.

798
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:04,630
Speaker 0: I mean don't play them a lot don't get good at.

799
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:11,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, just at least turn each ROM on and try to play it for a little bit and then you know Some of them will actually be fun.

800
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:17,472
Speaker 1: Keep playing those like pitfall and some of them won't be fun like the shitty version of pac-man for the 2600.

801
00:49:17,472 --> 00:49:18,375
Speaker 1: God, don't play.

802
00:49:18,395 --> 00:49:20,221
Speaker 0: that was like the worst game ever made.

803
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:21,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, just don't play those.

804
00:49:21,727 --> 00:49:22,289
Speaker 0: I mean it really.

805
00:49:23,352 --> 00:49:31,070
Speaker 0: Video games have come a long way But a lot of modern video games seem to miss the point that the point of a video game is that it's fun.

806
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:34,301
Speaker 0: And there are games that don't look fun.

807
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:39,909
Speaker 0: And even the people who are fans of the games When they play them, they don't look like they're having fun.

808
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:46,849
Speaker 1: It's like they're playing them like it's a chore or they're you know, they're playing it to like unlock a story bit or something.

809
00:49:47,673 --> 00:49:50,610
Speaker 0: Plus, I mean you'll see games that you know, the game is a bit shit.

810
00:49:50,931 --> 00:50:00,649
Speaker 0: But you'll play it and then you'll play a modern game and realize that the modern game is Essentially the same game that was on the Atari just polished a little bit.

811
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:06,062
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone should make a frickin modern Yars revenge then it wouldn't suck.

812
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,810
Speaker 0: Someone should remake every Atari game modern.

813
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:21,361
Speaker 0: And they've done it quite a bit in a flash with good great No straight-up port just with good graphics like Xbox 360 graphics, but it's just like Yars revenge This exact same game with the same controls.

814
00:50:21,863 --> 00:50:23,128
Speaker 1: It's been done many times.

815
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:29,754
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, so I'll leave you with that and tomorrow we will have our coverage of Citicon 2006.
