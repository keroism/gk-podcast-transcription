Speaker 0: Legie Matsumoto's Queen emeraldus Did you actually read it the manga?

5
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:39,074
Speaker 0: Let's do this Previously on geek nights Alright, so uh we got tickets to a thing.

6
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:40,200
Speaker 0: well Scott saw this thing.

7
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:45,480
Speaker 0: We got tickets to it But I'm gonna read you the title of what the thing is and that's the reason why we're not gonna do a main bit.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,487
Speaker 0: We're going to right now the Queen's dinner club colon Mothership meat company.

9
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:56,100
Speaker 1: right well the there's a barbecue place.

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,615
Speaker 1: It's pretty good this near here and the guy who owns that opened up a new barbecue place.

11
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:00,820
Speaker 1: that is an even bigger cooker.

12
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:04,780
Speaker 1: So he doesn't run out of food like he does the other place, but it's a different style of barbecue.

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,659
Speaker 1: It's Texas style which I actually prefer and it's not open yet.

14
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:10,710
Speaker 1: But how are we eating there?

15
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,680
Speaker 1: because if you buy tickets, there's like a preview night.

16
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:17,640
Speaker 1: I guess he wants to fit You know see if his foods any good, and it's like four blocks away from this apartment.

17
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:24,255
Speaker 1: So we're gonna walk over there and eat barbecue all that cornbread And it's gonna have the same amazing cornbread from the other place.

18
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,186
Speaker 1: cornbread I just want to eat.

19
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:26,891
Speaker 1: I'll just got back.

20
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,655
Speaker 1: dude keep your meats.

21
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:28,380
Speaker 1: I want three cornbreads.

22
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:32,359
Speaker 0: So what was all that about?

23
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,719
Speaker 0: Because that was basically Scott was the one who was like hey should we go to this thing?

24
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,506
Speaker 1: well There's a barbecue place nearby.

25
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:41,340
Speaker 1: that's pretty good, but I've had some issues going there like they ran out of food.

26
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:43,547
Speaker 1: But their cornbread is like the best cornbread.

27
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:44,089
Speaker 1: I've ever had.

28
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,390
Speaker 0: it's like.

29
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:51,640
Speaker 0: we've said it's basically more like cornbread pudding Than just cornbread, and it's just big chunks of corn and real dangerous.

30
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:52,187
Speaker 1: But it's.

31
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:53,159
Speaker 1: you know the food is good there.

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:04,155
Speaker 1: So I heard that the guy who owned that restaurant was opening up another one near even closer to rims apartment where we are right now and I was keeping an eye waiting for that to actually happen.

33
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:04,959
Speaker 1: so we could eat there.

34
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:10,120
Speaker 1: And then I heard even more rumors like he bought smokers that were so big so he wouldn't run out of food.

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,023
Speaker 1: He'd have so much food.

36
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:12,106
Speaker 0: and now that I've seen them.

37
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:13,611
Speaker 0: They are pretty big.

38
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:14,654
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're enormous.

39
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:19,993
Speaker 1: so then I heard aha He's not open yet, but they're doing a special thing there.

40
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:21,579
Speaker 1: You can go eat there.

41
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:24,855
Speaker 1: There's gonna be like a one-time dinner for 60 bucks whatever.

42
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:30,346
Speaker 1: so we bought three tickets And we left stop podcasting and went on over there now I was into a partly because we've done this before.

43
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:35,552
Speaker 0: I mean there's that ramen joint that opened up as a pop-up like in the One night pop-up.

44
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,840
Speaker 1: This is a permanent restaurant.

45
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:42,120
Speaker 0: One night early open the ramen place became a permanent restaurant in a different building.

46
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:55,380
Speaker 1: That was like the test and then we discovered that actually this is like a dinner club thing the Queen's dinner club Which is basically a bunch of cool people just do like mostly old fat people except at our table.

47
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:59,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, well we I don't either at the table of cool people People mixed in.

48
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:01,920
Speaker 0: I would not say that it was all that people.

49
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:07,256
Speaker 0: It was definitely people who might be described as yuppies in their 30s to 40s.

50
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, which does not not describe us.

51
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:19,318
Speaker 0: But the point is we were we won table roulette because our table was basically just awesome nerds and people who got stuff going on.

52
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:24,800
Speaker 1: yeah Anyway, so we had some delicious barbecue including the cornbread.

53
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,266
Speaker 1: He made the same cornbread as the other.

54
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:28,958
Speaker 0: all that smoked pastrami though pastrami was like.

55
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,994
Speaker 0: at first I was sad because they didn't announce like the like the many many courses.

56
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:38,179
Speaker 0: so people just like we missed out on the duck But I found out later that a lot of the people who got the duck.

57
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:44,120
Speaker 0: They missed out on the pastrami that we got because we jumped right into line, so I feel like it was a wash.

58
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I'm gonna get.

59
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:48,558
Speaker 1: I gotta give me some pastrami anyway, and then it worked.

60
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,830
Speaker 1: today I had some free shnippers coming in and there's no limits.

61
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,058
Speaker 1: like we got honey milkshakes, and we just full.

62
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:56,799
Speaker 1: we went full out.

63
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:00,940
Speaker 0: So you know what?

64
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:03,749
Speaker 1: I've eaten too much food in the past.

65
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,055
Speaker 1: I probably might not even eat dinner.

66
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:06,140
Speaker 1: I haven't eaten since the shnippers.

67
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,826
Speaker 1: I'm probably not gonna eat until tomorrow.

68
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,117
Speaker 0: I've been trying to go mostly veg after Monday.

69
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:13,364
Speaker 0: Just because That was too much.

70
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:15,875
Speaker 1: I would have if there wasn't free shnippers.

71
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,899
Speaker 1: I didn't plan that.

72
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:21,516
Speaker 0: It's gonna be real bad though because the shnippers is like it's not a chain.

73
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,500
Speaker 0: There's just as one of them.

74
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,163
Speaker 1: There's four of them.

75
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:23,826
Speaker 0: Well.

76
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,890
Speaker 0: Where's the other ones?

77
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:26,477
Speaker 0: There's only the one originally.

78
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:27,060
Speaker 1: There's four.

79
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,680
Speaker 1: There's one mayor Madison Square Park.

80
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,305
Speaker 1: There's one downtown and there's another one.

81
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,520
Speaker 0: cuz I'd only ever been to the one like the main one the mothership the flagship.

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:47,598
Speaker 0: But then a few weeks ago as I tweeted I was walking a different way from my office like I went somewhere weird where I don't normally go And there's all these buildings that are always like under scaffold as the downtown one, and it's not open yet.

83
00:04:49,843 --> 00:04:50,870
Speaker 0: The new ones are new.

84
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:57,300
Speaker 1: is that if you go to their website It says where the four of them are but the Madison Square Park one has been there for quite a while.

85
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:05,540
Speaker 0: So I walk by a building that normally has a scaffold up in the scaffolds gone And I see the shnippers sign and for a tiny second my brain says there's no way.

86
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:10,597
Speaker 0: And then I walked over and sure enough there was a tiny sign that said yes shnippers is coming.

87
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:20,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Basically, you know people come to New York And if they're you know the Shake Shack is like the place to line up for which is great because you know Shake Shack is Not bad.

88
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,288
Speaker 1: no it's not bad.

89
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:24,121
Speaker 1: I will eat it a Shake Shack, and it is a delicious food I'll put it this way.

90
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:33,607
Speaker 0: I would not eat it a Shake Shack in New York because there's better options, but if I were like Anywhere else in America dude if you put a Shake Shack like in a suburb That's the best restaurant in the summer.

91
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:41,900
Speaker 1: yep if there was a Shake Shack within walking distance of any convention We go to right, but the point is you know Shake Shack is not worth waiting in line for but it's good.

92
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:46,660
Speaker 1: It's like ten times better than five guys, but shnippers is like way better than Shake Shack.

93
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:49,360
Speaker 0: It's way more choices of food, and it's not cheating.

94
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,606
Speaker 0: It's not like tourists.

95
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:52,134
Speaker 1: tourists are not lining up for it.

96
00:05:52,194 --> 00:05:58,058
Speaker 1: although at certain times Different locations may be crowded you don't have to wait in a very very very long line like you do.

97
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:58,480
Speaker 1: a Shake Shack.

98
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,720
Speaker 0: But like you know downstairs from the geek night studio in our apartment There's a place called the Baroness that has like the best burgers.

99
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:13,788
Speaker 0: But there's sort of like high quality expensive meat fancy burgers, and there's a time and place for that, but Shake Shack burgers are kind of like cheap crap.

100
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:14,209
Speaker 0: Oh burgers.

101
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:16,958
Speaker 0: They're good, but they're like that genre of burger that is cheap.

102
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:19,604
Speaker 0: Oh Snippers is the same level.

103
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:26,847
Speaker 0: so what you're definitely comparing apples to apples comparing the Shake Shack to the snippers the shippers is just better in Every possible regard.

104
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:30,946
Speaker 0: yeah, also the milkshakes Yeah, so one thing the place downstairs doesn't have.

105
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:35,158
Speaker 1: I mean you think like Shake Shack actually sort of has average milkshakes.

106
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:36,261
Speaker 1: like it tastes great It's a milkshake.

107
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:43,025
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, just aren't that many places that I went to shnippers, and I just had Honey vanilla milkshake.

108
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:43,988
Speaker 0: that is the one to get.

109
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:47,859
Speaker 1: I could have gotten honey salted caramel, but I was keeping it you know.

110
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, honey was really doing you any favors.

111
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:53,680
Speaker 0: Honey is just high fructose corn syrup from bees.

112
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,290
Speaker 0: No, it's pretty much as fructose.

113
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,160
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I think it is not fructose.

114
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:10,640
Speaker 0: I in fact am confident that I mean I'm pulling up a Wikipedia right here that the only reason honey is special Is that there's laws saying that even though you can make synthetic honey?

115
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:12,813
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to call it honey, even though.

116
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,940
Speaker 0: It's basically the same.

117
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,279
Speaker 1: No, I thought it was special because the sugar is mixed in with the honey goop.

118
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:19,871
Speaker 1: No, you don't get honey honey honey.

119
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:20,554
Speaker 1: You don't get honey.

120
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:24,185
Speaker 1: Goop if you just have sugar Honey gives it that extra.

121
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:25,489
Speaker 0: What is the composition of honey?

122
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,794
Speaker 0: I'm scrolling down here.

123
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:28,179
Speaker 0: all will be known.

124
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,036
Speaker 0: China Apparently makes all the honey in the world.

125
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:32,659
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there's a lot of beekeepers around here.

126
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:38,480
Speaker 0: China makes more than like every other country at the top of this list combined their mad bees in China.

127
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:41,394
Speaker 0: So, let's see top five honey countries.

128
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:45,268
Speaker 0: China makes 0.47. it doesn't tell me what.

129
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:47,534
Speaker 1: that is a measure of half a percent of the honey.

130
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:50,589
Speaker 0: I don't know Turkey is 0.09 That's number two.

131
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,028
Speaker 0: Oh World is 1.7.

132
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:54,859
Speaker 0: So whatever the millions of tons.

133
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:59,940
Speaker 0: So China the top five are China Turkey, Argentina, Ukraine, Russia.

134
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:01,523
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can.

135
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,687
Speaker 1: even our bees died.

136
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:03,310
Speaker 1: Yeah.

137
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:05,237
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's that you know what you think.

138
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:06,423
Speaker 0: we make a lot of honey We don't?

139
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:09,279
Speaker 0: we make a lot of like artisanal craft honey.

140
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:15,599
Speaker 1: All right physical composition as China's making the China's making the shitty honey that comes in the bear.

141
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:17,123
Speaker 1: That's not the honey.

142
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:17,564
Speaker 1: I use.

143
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:18,447
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

144
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:19,411
Speaker 0: Just tell me what's in honey.

145
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:27,165
Speaker 0: All right, honey is primarily fructose 38% fructose 31% glucose.

146
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:28,911
Speaker 1: that's kind of equal Scott.

147
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:31,560
Speaker 0: That's more fructose than is in high fructose corn syrup.

148
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,501
Speaker 0: I think one.

149
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:34,126
Speaker 1: it's like 1/3 fructose 1/3 glucose 1/3 honey.

150
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:34,347
Speaker 1: Goop of 7%.

151
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:45,391
Speaker 0: maltose 1% sucrose 17% water 1% other sugars 2% 0.2% ash.

152
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:46,474
Speaker 1: Emily adds up to a hundred percent.

153
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:47,436
Speaker 1: Where's the honey goop and 3% unknown?

154
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,122
Speaker 1: unknown.

155
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:52,190
Speaker 0: well like just garbage that gets in there.

156
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:53,596
Speaker 0: cuz bees, you know bees make it.

157
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,544
Speaker 0: you know, You don't have an FDA going into the bees and be like the legs Our petals.

158
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,177
Speaker 0: yeah beep boop, but look how much of it is ash.

159
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,587
Speaker 0: Alright, I fructose corn syrup.

160
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:07,293
Speaker 1: What part of it makes the honey goop.

161
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:08,737
Speaker 0: Hi for just corn syrup is 24% water.

162
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:10,830
Speaker 0: So more water by default.

163
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:18,500
Speaker 0: Uh Okay, so high for just for corn syrup has 10 to 20 percent more fructose than honey.

164
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,223
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good.

165
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:20,649
Speaker 0: But it's not that much more.

166
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:25,650
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm no one's trying to say honey isn't just sugar It is mostly fructose.

167
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:33,419
Speaker 1: I'm just saying honey also has honey goop Which gives it a flavor that is very very different from just fucking sugar.

168
00:09:34,043 --> 00:09:36,700
Speaker 0: I'm confident you can make synthetic honey, and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

169
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,566
Speaker 1: It's corn syrup.

170
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,399
Speaker 1: If you drink it, it tastes like sugar water.

171
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,951
Speaker 0: Have you ever drunk corn syrup?

172
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:43,820
Speaker 0: or if you just drunk beverages sweetened by it?

173
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,459
Speaker 1: I've had a you know bottle of corn syrup for cooking and then I took some out and I just ate it.

174
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:51,413
Speaker 1: I didn't like drink it like Chuck.

175
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:52,198
Speaker 1: Well go go go.

176
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:57,499
Speaker 1: I like, you know had some and I had on my finger and I licked it and it tasted like sugar water only thick.

177
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,453
Speaker 1: It's the same as if you like you're making simple syrup.

178
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:04,646
Speaker 1: you put sugar and water and boil it And then I use it to make lemonade.

179
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,815
Speaker 1: It tastes like that only thicker.

180
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:10,669
Speaker 0: Yep, man I should start making the lemonade again.

181
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,713
Speaker 1: Don't make lemonade.

182
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:12,376
Speaker 1: Why not?

183
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:13,540
Speaker 1: I made lemonade recently.

184
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,610
Speaker 1: You know what is what happens first you got to buy lemons.

185
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,880
Speaker 1: lemons ain't cheap for the amount I needed like eight lemons.

186
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:21,747
Speaker 0: Just buy lemon juice man.

187
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:23,333
Speaker 1: Hold on see let.

188
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,220
Speaker 1: if you just buy lemons, right?

189
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,260
Speaker 1: The lemons end up being more expensive than just buying simply lemonade.

190
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,453
Speaker 1: Yeah, right not even counting the cost of the sugar water and your effort.

191
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:32,980
Speaker 0: So I'm saying buy just lemon juice.

192
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:34,705
Speaker 1: It's hard to find lemon juice.

193
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:37,394
Speaker 0: That's not full of sodium benzoate or whatever.

194
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,480
Speaker 1: No, that's not actually fucking lemon juice.

195
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,728
Speaker 1: It's always like from concentrate high fructose corn syrup.

196
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:43,173
Speaker 1: It's not easy to find lemon juice.

197
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,260
Speaker 1: That's actually just already squeezed lemons.

198
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:49,975
Speaker 0: Well, what's wrong with from concentrate if it still doesn't have any fructose stuff in it?

199
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,240
Speaker 1: it all had fructose stuff.

200
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:53,512
Speaker 1: I could not find a lemon juice.

201
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:54,900
Speaker 1: That was just lemon juice.

202
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:57,980
Speaker 0: I'm confident I can get that from the yuppie grocery near here.

203
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,137
Speaker 1: But if I'm going to buy just lemon juice, I could buy just lemon.

204
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:06,400
Speaker 0: Hey, yeah But the reason to make your own lemonade is one fuck it you make limeade instead.

205
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:11,260
Speaker 1: But - you can just buy limeade from simply but - and limes are even more expensive.

206
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,239
Speaker 1: And the lime and finding lime juice that is that is a hundred percent lime juice is even harder.

207
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:19,800
Speaker 0: Oh god I know that the lime George is not a joke.

208
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:24,900
Speaker 0: I've noticed over the last several years that the limes we get are getting smaller and smaller.

209
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,251
Speaker 1: I could not find any lime juice at all.

210
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:29,000
Speaker 1: That was actually lime juice.

211
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,344
Speaker 1: It was just like lime flavor.

212
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:35,100
Speaker 0: the problem simply or the whatever is that it's too sweet and not acid enough.

213
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:37,259
Speaker 1: I never had that problem.

214
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:37,762
Speaker 0: I like.

215
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:41,080
Speaker 0: I like my lemonade and my limeade to be more like just biting into a lemon.

216
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:41,824
Speaker 1: So here's what you do.

217
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:47,645
Speaker 1: you go to the street fair that's there every weekend in a different part of the city Bike on up and say hey I got.

218
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:55,340
Speaker 1: I was there recently because It was on Steinway and I was on a netrunner tournament a few blocks away And I needed a drink and the game store only sells poison.

219
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:55,902
Speaker 1: I don't drink.

220
00:11:56,384 --> 00:12:04,715
Speaker 1: so I walked over there and there's a lady with a little lemonade stand and you know I was like hey Give me a mango lemonade and she just she's like do you want sugar?

221
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,560
Speaker 1: and I'm like There's made the sugar in the mango juice.

222
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:15,746
Speaker 1: She just took lemon and she took ice and she not too much ice had plenty of beverage and she squirted mango into it And she didn't add sugar.

223
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:17,513
Speaker 1: So it was you know, so I wasn't.

224
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:19,420
Speaker 0: when I was in Wildwood last something happened.

225
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,625
Speaker 0: There's actually kind of bad, you know, Curly's has the giant The delicious but 90% ice.

226
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, also like 10% just granulated sugar, but you can get refills.

227
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:35,106
Speaker 0: So it's okay, but they have the lemonade in the orangeade and I remember in the past I would see them squeezing the lemons.

228
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:37,654
Speaker 1: They didn't squeeze they were it wasn't actually.

229
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:45,700
Speaker 0: so I don't know if it's true with the lemons But when I ordered the orangeade and in the past I recall that never seen them having oranges I did see them having oranges.

230
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:47,276
Speaker 0: I remember specifically seeing that.

231
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:52,219
Speaker 0: all right They may and I remember that the problem with that place was that you're so thirsty and you buy it and you drink it.

232
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,479
Speaker 0: then You realize that there's like a centimeter of sugar just like piled at the bottom of your glass.

233
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:58,567
Speaker 1: good It didn't you didn't drink it.

234
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:12,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I When I got it I watched them make it and they literally just went into the spigot and got fructose orange juice shit Into the cup until it was like mostly full so syrup.

235
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:16,389
Speaker 0: and then no Well, it was like basically like orange soda but not carbonated.

236
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,119
Speaker 0: Mmm, and then they dumped the sugar in it and handed it to me.

237
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:23,999
Speaker 0: So they gave me sugar water with sugar in it.

238
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,446
Speaker 0: So, yeah end of an era a dream has died.

239
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:33,209
Speaker 1: why not take traffic an orange juice and add Sure, you know added sugars, right?

240
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:33,833
Speaker 1: It's like it doesn't.

241
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:34,980
Speaker 0: actually you know what I should do.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,285
Speaker 0: I should just buy the simply but then dump it into a decanter in the fridge and then just squeeze like two more lemons into it.

243
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:43,785
Speaker 0: Good, that might do it.

244
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:50,063
Speaker 0: I gotta experiment like when you were trying to recreate that perfect blend from Adult pineapple.

245
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:57,086
Speaker 1: orange juice used to be pineapple juice orange juice and lemon and then at some point they changed the recipe to where the number One juice in there was Apple.

246
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:59,700
Speaker 0: pretty much every juice these days is actually apple juice.

247
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:02,368
Speaker 1: I was originally pineapple orange and lemon.

248
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:07,391
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know what soda pop was originally cane sugar sugar sugar.

249
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:12,040
Speaker 0: So I saw some people that were vague one.

250
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:17,300
Speaker 0: I feel like almost no one in America knew who captain Tsubasa was except for Anna Twitter.

251
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:20,412
Speaker 1: Yeah, people in America don't know who captain Tsubasa is.

252
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:33,040
Speaker 1: cuz a we don't care about soccer B. It's not an anime that was even shown here to any of the anime fans haven't seen it only the most hardcore of anime fans and Japanese people living in America and that sort of person knows what that is in the United States.

253
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,442
Speaker 0: but a lot of people were kind of assuming and expecting especially with Pokemon go that the thing Japan would do at the Olympics would Be Pokemon.

254
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:47,800
Speaker 1: Well, Pokemon is one of Japanese Japan's biggest cultural things, but Pokemon hasn't spread to the entire world, right?

255
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:55,888
Speaker 1: It's like all of Asia and the United States and Canada and you know Europe certain, you know certain places in the world.

256
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:57,332
Speaker 1: pokemania has taken over.

257
00:14:57,393 --> 00:15:07,606
Speaker 1: But if you go to like, I don't know like Africa or you know Brazil say where the Olympics were like Pokemania hasn't taken over there as much.

258
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:21,997
Speaker 0: so I'm gonna quote the anime news network article that itself sourced BuzzFeed Japan which talked about this and this article link to is just kind of interesting because it talks a lot about Recognition and like why Japan chose what it did for the closing ceremony and all that stuff.

259
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:22,860
Speaker 0: but quotes.

260
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:34,490
Speaker 0: according to BuzzFeed Japan There are distinct reasons why we did not catch a glimpse of our unique monster commandments and unidentified Tokyo Olympic Paralympic Committee member said that the team behind the ceremony show began preparations in January

261
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:35,352
Speaker 1: before

262
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:45,160
Speaker 0: Pokemon go hit a big and additionally Mario games have consistently outsold Pokemon games Worldwide and Pokemon is not as well known.

263
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,505
Speaker 1: Comparatively that's true.

264
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:48,915
Speaker 1: My Mario is such a recognized character.

265
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:50,160
Speaker 1: He's had like the Mickey Mouse level.

266
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,160
Speaker 1: In fact, Mickey Mouse has declined because Disney doesn't use Mickey Mouse at all.

267
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:59,840
Speaker 0: Now while they're relatively recent like Mickey Mouse cartoons that are really good as far as I can tell they're only on YouTube.

268
00:16:00,362 --> 00:16:00,963
Speaker 0: Like they're not.

269
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:02,508
Speaker 1: they're on in Times Square.

270
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,558
Speaker 1: You can see one like on the giant sign on the side of a building.

271
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,000
Speaker 0: Oh But anyway, but yeah, like Mickey Mouse is not like any face every day.

272
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:19,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, kids do not, you know might know who Mickey Mouse is cuz he's like the face it but it's like, you know when It's like Mickey Mouse cartoons were big a hundred years ago.

273
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,769
Speaker 1: You know, what's the last time you saw Mickey Fantasia?

274
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,934
Speaker 1: kids haven't seen that shit.

275
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,520
Speaker 0: I was in Disney recently.

276
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:27,788
Speaker 0: Didn't see a lot of Mickey?

277
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:35,723
Speaker 0: actually you see him on the logo Welcome to Disney like the only character actor that I saw a lot of just because we were sitting somewhere and then he was doing His thing was Rafiki.

278
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:36,746
Speaker 1: Really?

279
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:37,408
Speaker 1: Okay.

280
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:38,512
Speaker 0: He was doing a good job though.

281
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:41,180
Speaker 1: I mean all those people are like super professionals.

282
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:43,728
Speaker 1: Yeah You don't get that job if you suck like.

283
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:51,540
Speaker 0: you don't realize how a pro that is like even if you think you know it Until you're there again cuz you're used to seeing people in costumes kind of like, you know mugging for the cat.

284
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,660
Speaker 1: Those are people all those people who do jobs like that like tour guide on the duck bus and right.

285
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,764
Speaker 1: Those are all people have acting skills, but didn't get into TV and movies The per and the people.

286
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:08,183
Speaker 1: and in terms of that level like in at Disney World in a costume is like the highest level you Can get like.

287
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:13,525
Speaker 1: a lot of those people probably have been in TV and movies or will be Even in a fancy costume.

288
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:16,174
Speaker 0: who is not trained versus someone at Disney?

00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:25,898
Speaker 0: You got any news?

292
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,829
Speaker 1: yeah, so What was my news?

293
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:39,180
Speaker 1: again, all right, so Astro boy, you know, it's a big deal, you know in Japan and whatnot, right and actually Dark Horse is republishing.

294
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Speaker 1: You know Astro boy the manga came out in the US and there's little tiny volumes.

295
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:46,600
Speaker 1: Dark Horse has been republishing them in an omnibus edition.

296
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:51,500
Speaker 1: So it's only it's not gonna be that many volumes because they're huge and they're a bargain.

297
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:54,098
Speaker 1: so you'll be able to easily read all the asteroid manga if you want.

298
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:59,956
Speaker 1: and You know, a lot of Tezuka manga has been reprinted over recently and whatnot.

299
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:03,889
Speaker 1: so on Kickstarter I was surprised to see a Tezuka related Kickstarter.

300
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:06,056
Speaker 1: That wasn't more manga.

301
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:11,740
Speaker 1: In fact, I don't think DMP has done any more Tezuka mangas recently on Kickstarter.

302
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,975
Speaker 1: They were doing a whole bunch of them and then they sort of dried up that.

303
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:14,237
Speaker 1: well.

304
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:21,540
Speaker 1: anyway This Kickstarter for a Tezuka thing is for a digital collectible card game.

305
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:26,900
Speaker 0: How was this even officially license because Tezuka is dead and can't stop them?

306
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,080
Speaker 1: No, but like the Tezuka company Tezuka productions is like actually not stupid and they're not like a lot of.

307
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:35,159
Speaker 1: You know, what's it called?

308
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,779
Speaker 1: Things that hold on to your stuff when you're dead.

309
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:43,085
Speaker 1: Trust yeah, whatever You know, they like.

310
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:45,373
Speaker 1: they do a good job protecting the house, right?

311
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:46,979
Speaker 0: They're not like the token estate, right?

312
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,582
Speaker 1: They're not.

313
00:18:47,602 --> 00:18:48,245
Speaker 1: I was about to say.

314
00:18:48,265 --> 00:19:00,740
Speaker 1: they're not like the token estate or the Martin Luther King estate where they protect the house Too well, and they're not like some other estates that don't protect the house enough Like I think if I if you have to have an estate, yeah state was the word I was looking for not trust.

315
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:04,658
Speaker 1: I feel like that's how you want to go the Tezuka level of protecting the house.

316
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:11,200
Speaker 0: My only my only wish now is that when we are both dead if you we have enough property worth.

317
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:20,380
Speaker 0: No, if you revive geek nights in some fashion My only stipulation is that you do not revive it as a collectible card game, right?

318
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:22,908
Speaker 0: That is so this Kickstarter.

319
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:41,319
Speaker 0: just looking at it just looking at this first page not even clicking on anything One there's only one sentence here at the top under the campaign like before it goes into the details but that sentence is a Digital CCG based on the work of the godfather of manga Osamu Tezuka's universe featuring world-famous creatives.

320
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:46,859
Speaker 1: right, so the art, you know is definitely his characters, but not in his art style at all.

321
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:50,226
Speaker 0: and Oh Kickstarter flagged it as a project.

322
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:54,660
Speaker 1: They love to yet the product mean this is gonna be a real bad game.

323
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,306
Speaker 1: Maybe not as bad as boys guys.

324
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:57,610
Speaker 0: I mean, it's possible.

325
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,072
Speaker 0: It could be good.

326
00:19:58,232 --> 00:19:59,316
Speaker 0: Technically it is possible.

327
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:01,346
Speaker 1: anything is possible But this is going.

328
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:02,897
Speaker 1: I guarantee this will be a bad game.

329
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:05,190
Speaker 0: much You know much like in our judge anime.

330
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,140
Speaker 0: by its cover and you will feature in anime Boston.

331
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:10,060
Speaker 0: There are warning signs that don't necessarily.

332
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,089
Speaker 0: Everything about this is a warning sign warnings on number one.

333
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,435
Speaker 0: It is based on an intellectual property.

334
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:17,040
Speaker 0: That is not already a game.

335
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:24,557
Speaker 0: that is that's already death for a game, especially a CCG.

336
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:27,838
Speaker 0: I Mean remember the Star Wars CCG the first one.

337
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,094
Speaker 0: Remember the Sim City CCG.

338
00:20:30,134 --> 00:20:30,880
Speaker 0: This is gonna be like that.

339
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:46,040
Speaker 0: This game is gonna be bad and the fact that it's digital Actually gives me even less faith in it because it means that they'll be able to make the kinds of mistakes that were hitherto Impossible to people making CCGs because they were limited by the physicality of the cards.

340
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:58,912
Speaker 0: No one involved in this is gonna be as skilled as Blizzard and I guarantee this game is going to be garbage and I also pretty much guarantee that it's not going to be popular right now.

341
00:20:59,012 --> 00:21:21,086
Speaker 1: if you want to invest on Kickstarter not in technically not invest but purchase a Comics related game on Kickstarter there is right now for the next 47 hours Hurry up the Prince Valiant storytelling game by Greg Stafford who has also made games such as King Arthur Pendragon and whatnot.

342
00:21:21,508 --> 00:21:25,400
Speaker 1: This is actually a reprint of an old game that's been out of print for a super long time.

343
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:30,560
Speaker 1: But Prince Valiant the is the tabletop RPG has been out of print for a super long time.

344
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:31,807
Speaker 1: Like I just said, I just

345
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:32,169
Speaker 0: backed it

346
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:52,777
Speaker 1: right, but this game is A game which is like a really simple RPG so you can play it with like Kids and you can read it real quick and it's like super convenient and it also hopefully if you play it with kids They'll be interested in Prince Valiant Because nobody knows about Prince Valiant anymore cares.

347
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:57,464
Speaker 0: So for $7,000 you can.

348
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:02,275
Speaker 0: you too can be the executive producer of that Astro Boy game.

349
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:03,619
Speaker 1: They don't have an executive producer.

350
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:04,200
Speaker 1: That's a problem.

351
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,620
Speaker 0: So that's something I've noticed lately is that kick-started games will pretty much always make the top tier.

352
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:21,679
Speaker 0: You get an executive producer credit so you can back a bunch of projects Which it seems like a lot of people do and then on your LinkedIn profile You can be like I was the executive producer for these 11 video games.

353
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:22,764
Speaker 1: Huh?

354
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:24,229
Speaker 1: I'm rich.

355
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't need a job.

356
00:22:25,534 --> 00:22:27,180
Speaker 1: Why do I need to put things on my LinkedIn?

357
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,377
Speaker 1: I can afford to spend seventy five hundred dollars on a crappy CCG that'll last.

358
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:37,680
Speaker 0: five minutes Would buy us like four packs Australia's.

359
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:45,779
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that's a lot of monies But there's so many I like four bicycles.

360
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:48,627
Speaker 0: Oh the reward and things like every.

361
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:49,670
Speaker 0: get every common card.

362
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:50,312
Speaker 0: x4.

363
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:52,418
Speaker 0: get every uncommon card.

364
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:52,458
Speaker 0: x4.

365
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:56,140
Speaker 0: Get one of every rare card get one.

366
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:06,940
Speaker 0: So basically people who back the Kickstarter for this CCG are gonna already have all the black lotuses Yes, and also unlike say magic the gathering.

367
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:16,880
Speaker 0: This is why I play an LCG and not a CCG or the Pokemon game Which have or like Hearthstone which have experts continuing to weed that garden and maintain those cards over time.

368
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:19,259
Speaker 0: This game is not going to get maintained.

369
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:23,616
Speaker 1: This is a CCG being made by artists and not being made by game people.

370
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:27,149
Speaker 1: It also looks Go play a Japanese CCG.

371
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:27,671
Speaker 1: They're bad.

372
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:31,484
Speaker 1: They're not good games, but almost all of them All of them.

373
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:34,177
Speaker 0: this does not look good.

374
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:37,507
Speaker 0: I Feel bad that this exists.

375
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:39,171
Speaker 0: I'm kind of sad now.

376
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:42,880
Speaker 1: I mean like Yu-Gi-Oh is a jet right card fight Vanguard.

377
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,065
Speaker 1: That's the kind of game they make.

378
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:51,057
Speaker 0: so speaking of ice crease fucking Vanguard God seven flashbacks to old kinetic arms, right.

379
00:23:51,238 --> 00:24:02,480
Speaker 0: so Speaking of sad it's not news that people on tumblr who are artists and fans of shows Harass other people who are fans of shows and or are artists about stupid shit.

380
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Speaker 1: Yeah If you're gonna be on tumblr don't follow and join those people in those kinds of communities because they're just bad people.

381
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:20,078
Speaker 0: Now what happened relatively recently and this specific thing seems to happen primarily With Steven Universe and not other shows what I mean aren't all the shows like this like the.

382
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:22,351
Speaker 1: you know The supernatural people and the.

383
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:23,800
Speaker 1: what are the other ones that have drawn?

384
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:31,131
Speaker 0: I feel like just because there's been multiple instances lately that I've run afoul of And this isn't just the current show that has drama.

385
00:24:31,151 --> 00:24:32,275
Speaker 1: You sure really gonna say that?

386
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:32,677
Speaker 1: none of the?

387
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:33,540
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure everybody.

388
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, super natural.

389
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:37,273
Speaker 1: There wasn't drama in the Harry Potter communities.

390
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:39,440
Speaker 0: So this is not drama within the community.

391
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:46,660
Speaker 0: This is drama where the fan community Harassed someone actually working on the show so much that they had to delete their Twitter account.

392
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,666
Speaker 1: How did they reach this person?

393
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:53,600
Speaker 0: So basically now she's off Twitter to not have to deal with this stuff.

394
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,092
Speaker 0: I assume she has like some secret locked account somewhere.

395
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:57,540
Speaker 1: Now is this person like an animator?

396
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,867
Speaker 0: So Lauren Zook deleted her Twitter account on Friday.

397
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,429
Speaker 0: blah blah blah.

398
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,920
Speaker 0: She's a storyboard artist and basically just a storyboard artist.

399
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:06,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, what the fans were mad about?

400
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,813
Speaker 1: Okay, that there was a bad storyboard and otherwise you got the wrong person.

401
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:12,660
Speaker 0: Steven Universe fans are fucking nuts.

402
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:22,726
Speaker 0: So and I say that as someone who loves the show they were mad That she drew a sketch that showed two characters Possibly being romantic with each other.

403
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:33,699
Speaker 0: and because that was the wrong pairing those characters should be dating different people They decided to harass her in person as much as they could until they drove her off Twitter.

404
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:43,469
Speaker 0: Okay, their complaints seemed to be that she was undermining the integrity of the show by Advocating for a particular relationship.

405
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:44,794
Speaker 0: That wasn't the one they wanted.

406
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,540
Speaker 0: they wanted to other characters to date.

407
00:25:47,322 --> 00:25:50,129
Speaker 0: So it's kind of like what happened.

408
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:59,780
Speaker 0: only luckily the No Man's Sky team doesn't have to deal with this like level of Specific directed harassment where the fans made some shit up about your thing.

409
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:08,660
Speaker 1: What I would do if I was her right if I drawing skills I would draw every how many characters are in the show, right at this point you there's like.

410
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,747
Speaker 0: There's a lot more gems now since when you stopped watching.

411
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:18,227
Speaker 1: I'm just saying you could conceivably draw every single pairing And just post of one after another.

412
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:19,110
Speaker 0: you know what I would post.

413
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,277
Speaker 1: I'd only post one and threesomes.

414
00:26:21,317 --> 00:26:22,320
Speaker 1: just start going right.

415
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,770
Speaker 0: It's just like I would post one's guaranteed.

416
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:30,453
Speaker 0: It would be Lars and everyone one by one Every day.

417
00:26:30,554 --> 00:26:32,324
Speaker 0: eight Lars Once.

418
00:26:32,344 --> 00:26:33,470
Speaker 1: that would take a long time right?

419
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,214
Speaker 1: just every day.

420
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:38,192
Speaker 1: just quick sketch Maybe like a five-minute sketch of a new pairing you haven't done.

421
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:40,060
Speaker 1: and keep track on a little sheet little spreadsheet.

422
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:41,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, just keep posting more.

423
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:44,913
Speaker 0: But this is like a confluence of two trends that I just block.

424
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:50,480
Speaker 0: everyone on Twitter are getting kind of worrying And we just have to figure out how to deal with it in that one fans of things both.

425
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:52,504
Speaker 1: These are all 13 year olds right?

426
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:55,010
Speaker 1: so actually technically legally aren't they even not allowed on Twitter.

427
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:01,272
Speaker 1: Child protection online protection pretty sure there is some guy right.

428
00:27:01,332 --> 00:27:03,220
Speaker 0: it's like the child online protection act.

429
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,851
Speaker 1: I can't imagine there that you know.

430
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:10,559
Speaker 1: as age increases I'm sure the likelihood of being in that group of people who are harassing her decreases.

431
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:15,977
Speaker 0: however I worry that it's not like Gomer gate But I still feel like the upper age on these people is in the mid 20s.

432
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,478
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure there are older people, but I'm sure the bulk of it is younger kids.

433
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:22,284
Speaker 0: But it's this conflict.

434
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:22,826
Speaker 0: two factors.

435
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:39,419
Speaker 0: on one hand these fans who watch a show and like just get really like Scarily deeply into it and identified too much with it simultaneously have access Via social media to a lot of the people who make that thing and Tied with that much like with no man's sky.

436
00:27:39,921 --> 00:27:45,693
Speaker 0: They make shit up about the thing you made and then they get mad at you when the thing you made isn't the thing that They made up.

437
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:48,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz they're crazy little teenagers.

438
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:50,673
Speaker 1: Yep, so just fucking ignore them,

439
00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:54,710
Speaker 0: but I just I don't understand Why it seems like either

440
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,862
Speaker 1: ignore them or give them the smackdown Above

441
00:27:56,902 --> 00:28:05,090
Speaker 0: and beyond all the others like the pony people like sure the bronies are annoying But they never quite got to the level that the Steven Universe people did.

442
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,709
Speaker 0: Mmm, no, I don't think so.

443
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:09,614
Speaker 0: They're more I guess.

444
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:10,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that's true.

445
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,940
Speaker 0: Is that you know the very annoying from a washing them from afar and going guys really?

446
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,880
Speaker 1: Oh pony people never did go and attack or harass as far as I know any of the people working.

447
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,696
Speaker 0: I mean, they probably say they probably lost in the voice actors, right?

448
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:39,271
Speaker 1: They probably yeah They were stalking and or you know going, you know wanting to see and speak with People do and they're fans of a person, but I didn't like Why did you give Scootaloo parents?

449
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:43,831
Speaker 0: She was supposed to be an orphan in my head Can and you fucking ruin the show you piece of garbage.

450
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:44,956
Speaker 1: Did they give Scootaloo parents?

451
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:45,559
Speaker 0: I don't know.

452
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:47,291
Speaker 0: I gotta catch up on the current season.

453
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:48,640
Speaker 0: I've been too busy watching Steven Universe.

454
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,697
Speaker 1: I don't even know how much there's been since I stopped by.

455
00:28:50,818 --> 00:28:53,047
Speaker 0: so the danger warning.

456
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:55,336
Speaker 0: one of the episodes of the season I saw a clip from.

457
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:59,293
Speaker 0: it is The ponies are all at a comic convention about daring do.

458
00:28:59,313 --> 00:29:00,820
Speaker 1: Oh bad cosplay.

459
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,563
Speaker 1: That's gonna be the.

460
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:03,873
Speaker 1: what was the fan service episode from the last?

461
00:29:04,214 --> 00:29:04,676
Speaker 0: Oh, yep.

462
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:04,998
Speaker 0: Yep.

463
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:05,439
Speaker 0: Same deal.

464
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's danger sign cuz I like.

465
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,557
Speaker 1: that's disappointing though, cuz I like daring do.

466
00:29:09,577 --> 00:29:13,153
Speaker 0: yeah Well, it was weird when they made daring do a literal character.

467
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:14,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was weird.

468
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:22,560
Speaker 0: But - there was an episode that I saw another clip for where spike gets trapped enemy mind style.

469
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:26,259
Speaker 0: It looks like with one of the changelings from the failed war.

470
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:29,320
Speaker 0: So that could be good that could be good Yeah.

471
00:29:29,782 --> 00:29:31,689
Speaker 0: So I feel like the show is gonna continue to be.

472
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,375
Speaker 0: what last season was that sort of like?

473
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:36,306
Speaker 0: it either hits or it misses And it's about a 50/50 shot.

474
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:42,447
Speaker 0: I'm sure but I haven't watched it yet, so I can't say but Seriously, Steven Universe fans.

475
00:29:42,468 --> 00:29:43,331
Speaker 0: Just call me shit.

476
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:53,359
Speaker 0: Just settle little a things of the day.

477
00:29:54,301 --> 00:30:04,538
Speaker 0: This was posted to me like a little while ago By our friend Chris was a. Chris O'Rourke posted it in our in our secret hangout, I don't know one of them.

478
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:04,920
Speaker 0: But anyway.

479
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:12,440
Speaker 0: So I was joking a while ago about how you know, I can't get my competitive rank in overwatch too high.

480
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,887
Speaker 0: I'm peaked out at 51.

481
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:15,395
Speaker 0: That's like the best I could do in season one.

482
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:16,219
Speaker 1: 50 like average.

483
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:19,939
Speaker 0: No, the way it the way it actually skews it's above average.

484
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:28,337
Speaker 0: It was a slightly above average because 51 Cluster everyone so tightly in the middle because the ranks only go up to 100. that was kind of dumb the neck.

485
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:29,521
Speaker 0: in season 2.

486
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:32,250
Speaker 0: The ranks are way way way way way way bigger.

487
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,580
Speaker 0: So there's a lot more room to really place you in the rankings.

488
00:30:36,122 --> 00:30:37,649
Speaker 0: They like completely changed the system.

489
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,994
Speaker 0: It's definitely for the better.

490
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:45,100
Speaker 0: but this Because what I was joking with we're playing a game and I was like, why don't we all go for the bottom rank?

491
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,965
Speaker 0: Like how bad would you have to be?

492
00:30:46,985 --> 00:30:49,553
Speaker 0: do I have to like actively sabotage my team?

493
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:51,760
Speaker 0: or is just being bad enough?

494
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,860
Speaker 0: What would it take to hit rank one?

495
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,261
Speaker 1: I mean just.

496
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:55,789
Speaker 1: I mean it's based on winning and losing.

497
00:30:55,829 --> 00:31:00,052
Speaker 1: so you could actually be really good and get lots of kills as long As you don't complete objectives and you lose the game.

498
00:31:00,313 --> 00:31:05,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, but You have to actually lose the games to rank down.

499
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:09,240
Speaker 0: Correct and you have to lose games against people who are relatively in your ranks.

500
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,519
Speaker 1: So if they're really bad, you got to find a way to get them to win.

501
00:31:14,282 --> 00:31:19,237
Speaker 1: So now in this is the way it gets harder as things go on because your opponents are shittier.

502
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:23,671
Speaker 0: the guy With the lowest possible rank in overwatch.

503
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:25,457
Speaker 0: There is a hero among us.

504
00:31:25,518 --> 00:31:42,180
Speaker 0: this hero actually went and worked hard to be the worst ranked player in the entire world at Overwatch and this article tells his hero and then he got down ranked and hit one.

505
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,659
Speaker 1: He got down ranked and it put him back at one because you can't go lower than one.

506
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:54,470
Speaker 0: So, I think the best part of this when he was talking about like what it's like when you get to like different levels and When he hit the 30s, he was like in the 30s.

507
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,200
Speaker 0: I met the angriest people in the world.

508
00:31:57,943 --> 00:32:03,567
Speaker 0: Like those are the people who think that they are way better than they are Right because I'm furious right?

509
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:04,732
Speaker 0: I mean that their rank is so low.

510
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:10,895
Speaker 1: They're not at the 50s where rim is So they're not even average right there below average, but they they're not in the zeros.

511
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:15,558
Speaker 1: like they know how to play They're just not any good at playing so they're stuck in these 30s.

512
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,408
Speaker 1: But they feel like they should be better.

513
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:20,587
Speaker 1: because like they know what they're they don't have the rules of the game They know what to do.

514
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,239
Speaker 1: They're just not winning games.

515
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:25,008
Speaker 1: So they're not ranking up beyond the 30s.

516
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:30,148
Speaker 0: So they're mad salty quote in the mid 30s I met the angriest people in the world.

517
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,258
Speaker 0: It's somewhere in that mid 30s number 20s area.

518
00:32:33,222 --> 00:32:35,112
Speaker 0: These are just the angriest people in the world.

519
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,540
Speaker 0: They think they should be doing better.

520
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:41,100
Speaker 0: They're really not good enough or these are just people stuck on really bad streaks.

521
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:42,394
Speaker 1: I guess I agree.

522
00:32:43,201 --> 00:32:57,219
Speaker 1: but if you have just a bad streak like let's say you play the game for like a whole night and you're drunk or Something or you're really tired, but you play anyway, and you just lose a bunch of games your arm hurts You know, you know for some reason even like pro baseball players like a it'll have a slump where they don't you know.

523
00:32:57,781 --> 00:33:07,480
Speaker 1: But if so, if that's the case you will eventually maybe like a. even if you have a bad month You can come back the next month and whoop right back up as soon as you you know, because you'll be fighting against chumps.

524
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,082
Speaker 1: You'll beat them all.

525
00:33:08,162 --> 00:33:20,037
Speaker 0: I bottomed out around 18 where I could still pick Hanzo and my team would just legitimately lose Either by me being a bad character or everyone else being self-devouring because they were so and so like.

526
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:22,449
Speaker 1: I'm just a bad character like that's under power.

527
00:33:22,469 --> 00:33:27,896
Speaker 0: so Hanzo is a Japanese honorable man who has a bow and arrow so it's a sniper.

528
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:28,780
Speaker 1: So it's a stereotype.

529
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:35,412
Speaker 0: So yeah, all the characters are stereotypes But there are two Japanese characters and they are both literally.

530
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:39,222
Speaker 0: I am honor like it's kind of Blizzard.

531
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:40,004
Speaker 1: get to work on that.

532
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:44,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the other characters are not that bad, but both Japanese characters are like that.

533
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,735
Speaker 0: But he's basically the shit.

534
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,348
Speaker 0: lord 13 year olds I'll pick a reaper because he's skull guy.

535
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:52,860
Speaker 0: the ones who are I know that well.

536
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, the people who are bad at the game the kind of people who Deadpool is their favorite character.

537
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,400
Speaker 0: Yep, if you're if you like Deadpool you're playing Reaper in this game.

538
00:34:01,162 --> 00:34:08,591
Speaker 0: But Hanzo is the one that people think they're good and they play Hanzo to snipe and they just ineffectually Ineffectually die in the corner.

539
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:09,739
Speaker 1: a sword guy is a sniper.

540
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:14,299
Speaker 0: I know so that there's one of the Japanese characters is sword guy and the other one is bow and arrow guy.

541
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,347
Speaker 0: Oh an arrow guy is Hanzo.

542
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:19,273
Speaker 1: shouldn't Hanzo be the sword guy.

543
00:34:20,116 --> 00:34:21,179
Speaker 0: Uh, that's Genji.

544
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:33,824
Speaker 0: Okay, so he was so bad and there was one game where the guy some someone on the team Just could not deal with this and is freaking out at him like Hanzo fucking change.

545
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:36,253
Speaker 0: God Hanzo use your alt kill no one.

546
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:39,694
Speaker 0: God Hanzo switch characters and Where is it?

547
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:51,469
Speaker 0: So every time this guy was yelling at me, he'd reply with a simple phrase all lowercase I Hanjo Spelled wrong.

548
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,429
Speaker 0: I Hanjo I Hanjo That is my new favorite thing.

549
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:56,172
Speaker 0: read this article.

550
00:34:56,213 --> 00:34:57,016
Speaker 0: This is amazing.

551
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,084
Speaker 1: is a hero I don't even know.

552
00:34:58,104 --> 00:35:00,060
Speaker 1: you don't need to play this game or know anything about it.

553
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,320
Speaker 1: You just need to know about gaming in general to understand that this man is a hero.

554
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:10,368
Speaker 0: In fact, I want to add a slide to talk about this in our panel because this guy had to grind Technically to get down to town to the bottom.

555
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:13,700
Speaker 0: He worked way harder than a lot of people trying to rank up.

556
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,746
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you got a thing of the day.

557
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:25,077
Speaker 1: I do so, you know one aspect of netrunner the game I played the most and I'm starting to play again because the weather's starting to get a little colder and Cards are coming out that are pretty hot.

558
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,167
Speaker 1: Is the arts right?

559
00:35:27,187 --> 00:35:32,345
Speaker 1: the arts and netrunner are like maybe the best arts on a Customizable card game that there is.

560
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:33,771
Speaker 0: Well, it helps that.

561
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,260
Speaker 1: it helps that it's cyberpunk arts and not fantasy arts.

562
00:35:36,562 --> 00:35:38,471
Speaker 0: The other day someone in the forum was like, all right.

563
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:40,120
Speaker 0: I've already seen goes to gel stand alone complex.

564
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:40,962
Speaker 0: What is the mother?

565
00:35:41,003 --> 00:35:41,925
Speaker 0: cyberpunk anime.

566
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,293
Speaker 0: and I ran out after like five.

567
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:46,540
Speaker 1: right just play netrunner anyway.

568
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:54,899
Speaker 1: So one of the guys who does a lot of the art there, you know You read every time I get new cards I look through and see the artists are and there's one guy.

569
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:57,992
Speaker 1: Think his name is Mike Zellinger.

570
00:35:58,012 --> 00:36:00,389
Speaker 1: I think is his name Hmm.

571
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:03,319
Speaker 1: All right Matt Zellinger, that's his name.

572
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:07,836
Speaker 1: Anyway, so he does almost pretty much all of the characters like the.

573
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:09,262
Speaker 1: whenever you get a runner There's always the.

574
00:36:09,282 --> 00:36:16,134
Speaker 1: you know a character right the human being or you know Something close to a human being maybe a robot or a cyborg who knows what.

575
00:36:16,616 --> 00:36:19,179
Speaker 1: but if it's a character He's usually the guy that draws it.

576
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,440
Speaker 1: So they're all in the same artistic style and he's got this great article going on.

577
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,314
Speaker 1: It might even be a series and this is part one.

578
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:25,858
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

579
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:35,479
Speaker 1: on Creative block calm where he talks about his like drawing and Photoshop process which you know If you're an artist, you don't really need to know how to draw you.

580
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,975
Speaker 1: It's like you know how to draw already or you don't and you're not gonna draw as well as him.

581
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:45,400
Speaker 1: reading this and you're not Gonna, you know if you already know how to draw this isn't gonna help you learn how to you know draw better.

582
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:53,460
Speaker 1: But what this will help you is learn about all the peculiarities of shit He has to put up with to draw a card game specific.

583
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:58,554
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Like make sure it works like a tiny part of this car that someone it's like.

584
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:03,720
Speaker 1: it's going to be on a tiny piece of Card, but they might want to put it on like a play mat.

585
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,477
Speaker 1: It has to be you know, like this resolution and these are the kind of colors you got to deal with it.

586
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,080
Speaker 1: the printer.

587
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:18,620
Speaker 1: Here's where they're gonna put like the stat thing how to make the it visit like it visible and easily Recognizable when the person like looks at it and you know It's like they can just look at the card and glance and know what card it.

588
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,511
Speaker 0: I don't want the skull shirt that this guy's wearing that noise.

589
00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:22,495
Speaker 1: I think it's noise.

590
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:32,354
Speaker 1: I like this skull shirt but yeah, um, there's some good article going on here for Card making art type stuffs good stuff in the minute moment.

591
00:37:32,374 --> 00:37:33,820
Speaker 0: We're going to be at PAX next week.

592
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:42,580
Speaker 0: This is probably the last show until we get back from PAX because I'm flying out on Tuesday to start packs dev and pregame And warm the hotel bed up for when Scott arrives on Thursday.

593
00:37:43,401 --> 00:37:49,125
Speaker 0: So on Saturday, we're doing the grind Saturday September 3rd 5 p.m.

594
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:49,967
Speaker 0: In the chicken theater.

595
00:37:49,987 --> 00:38:01,020
Speaker 0: That's one of the theaters actually in the convention center because it starts with C. There's only two left in the convention center as far as I can tell so I guess that's good or bad.

596
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:07,895
Speaker 0: I think the ones in the hotel might be bigger But I've noticed that the crowds for those have been lower as time has gone on.

597
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:11,348
Speaker 0: unless it's a big event Yeah, but it I don't know I could.

598
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:13,938
Speaker 0: we could do a whole separate thing in like the ebb and flow of panels.

599
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:15,300
Speaker 0: over the years They moved around a lot.

600
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,759
Speaker 0: Like it wasn't that long ago packs 2008 the first time we did beyond D and D. the first time we went to a PAX.

601
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:24,776
Speaker 0: The panel rooms were like these tiny rooms that seated like a couple hundred people tops.

602
00:38:25,277 --> 00:38:26,120
Speaker 0: Like there was no stage.

603
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,440
Speaker 0: We're just on the floor and packs come a long way since then, but we will be there doing this panel.

604
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:32,987
Speaker 0: I think it's looking pretty good.

605
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,156
Speaker 0: And as always I can't promise will you?

606
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:35,940
Speaker 0: I mean we're gonna video it.

607
00:38:36,384 --> 00:38:37,620
Speaker 0: I can't promise it'll go on YouTube.

608
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:41,077
Speaker 0: I mean it took three takes for me to get a good Atari game design to put up.

609
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:44,859
Speaker 0: just because Just because you do a panel doesn't mean you have good video of it.

610
00:38:45,261 --> 00:38:53,764
Speaker 0: Like I had one where the video was fine except after through the panel Scott and I kind of shifted four feet to the left and now Scott's just out of the frame for the whole rest of the panel.

611
00:38:53,804 --> 00:39:01,979
Speaker 0: well, but So, yeah If you're gonna be a pecs and you like us, you should probably go to that panel and see it.

612
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:03,691
Speaker 0: It's also not opposite anything.

613
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:04,900
Speaker 0: You probably care about for once.

614
00:39:05,221 --> 00:39:08,009
Speaker 0: It's not like choose that or the omega-thon finale.

615
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,758
Speaker 0: It's just like on Saturday in the middle of packs at a good time.

616
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:14,271
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm The book club book was oryx and crake.

617
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:15,497
Speaker 0: you can read about it.

618
00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:19,439
Speaker 0: the next book I don't have to keep mentioning that is well, you haven't put the new book club yet.

619
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:21,163
Speaker 0: Okay, it's your book.

620
00:39:21,183 --> 00:39:22,628
Speaker 0: You gotta make the post great.

621
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:26,657
Speaker 0: the next book club book, which Scott has not made a post for yet is Rebecca.

622
00:39:28,762 --> 00:39:35,068
Speaker 0: And the third book which Scott is not involved in for the geek nights politics salon is I think moon.

623
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:37,340
Speaker 0: the rise of the Third Reich puts you to sleep.

624
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,200
Speaker 0: We're reading about their Weimar Republic and it's some fascinating stuff and we're gonna have an argument about it at the end of September.

625
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:44,407
Speaker 1: Yeah arguing about that.

626
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,419
Speaker 1: Goodnight moon was to say goodnight to first.

627
00:39:48,744 --> 00:39:49,774
Speaker 0: All satellites matter.

628
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,560
Speaker 0: Otherwise Scott's doing a YouTube show where he eats lunch with you every day.

629
00:39:57,722 --> 00:40:03,149
Speaker 1: I'm doing a lot of YouTube shows But that's the only one that I'm producing Consistently because I just record on my phone and push the button.

630
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:05,780
Speaker 1: the other ones are being edited and filmed.

631
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:09,717
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to pick up with more and more sieve videos and just all that other sort of stuff.

632
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:19,036
Speaker 0: soon I'm gonna start trying to live stream overwatch, but I got to tweak my setup because shadowplay cannot be on or Civ 5 won't work.

633
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,591
Speaker 0: OBS it's live streaming overwatch on my ancient computer.

634
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:26,020
Speaker 0: not quite an optimal situation.

635
00:40:26,603 --> 00:40:27,187
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

636
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:28,152
Speaker 1: use a live wedge.

637
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,360
Speaker 1: it's a separate device, it's great.

638
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I could buy a second live wedge.

639
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,097
Speaker 1: You could also buy that, you know the live.

640
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:35,680
Speaker 1: What's the other one?

641
00:40:36,721 --> 00:40:38,430
Speaker 0: Or I could just finally buy my new computer.

642
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:40,460
Speaker 0: I think that might just have to happen.

643
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:44,300
Speaker 0: Excuses to buy computers excuses to buy bikes.

644
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:57,080
Speaker 0: So of all the leji Matsumoto verse characters out there I actually knew the least about emeraldus because I never really like watched or read any of the stuff about her.

645
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,060
Speaker 1: Well, cuz Queen emeraldus has like the least amount of media, right?

646
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,500
Speaker 1: It's like you'll be watching Galaxy Express this humongous TV show.

647
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:08,256
Speaker 1: You'll be watching Captain Harlock or something and it's like emeraldus shows up and goes away.

648
00:41:08,517 --> 00:41:09,260
Speaker 1: You watch a movie.

649
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:18,695
Speaker 1: They'll be like a few emeraldus scenes But like, you know the actual store complete story of emeraldus Isn't like in a lot like TV shows and movie like.

650
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:19,680
Speaker 1: there aren't a lot of them.

651
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,063
Speaker 1: There's like.

652
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,280
Speaker 1: I think there's a couple movies maybe something like that.

653
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,780
Speaker 1: I'm sure I could look it up But as far as I know there isn't some like super long clean emeraldus TV show.

654
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,925
Speaker 1: I will go verify that.

655
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:32,260
Speaker 1: and if there is I've never seen it and I've never seen in English.

656
00:41:32,842 --> 00:41:37,180
Speaker 0: I mean, I'd never even like seen really the manga until you handed me this hardcover, right?

657
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,867
Speaker 1: So leji Matsumoto manga in general.

658
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:40,970
Speaker 1: There's a lot of it.

659
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,451
Speaker 1: Actually.

660
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:42,975
Speaker 1: There's a Galaxy Express manga.

661
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:50,410
Speaker 1: There's all this stuff but It Hasn't been published in English extensively, right?

662
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,995
Speaker 1: It's like the Galaxy Express manga.

663
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:59,816
Speaker 1: part of it was in English but not the whole thing and even those volumes are super old and out of print and hard to get.

664
00:41:59,836 --> 00:42:05,234
Speaker 1: and You know, oh, so there was a queen emeraldus OAV.

665
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:10,806
Speaker 0: Yep, and a manga and And 78 that's that's what we're reading now.

666
00:42:11,107 --> 00:42:12,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's it.

667
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:15,340
Speaker 1: So finally someone says huh?

668
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:15,718
Speaker 1: You know what?

669
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:21,620
Speaker 1: There's probably people, you know All these other mangas that no one ever never heard of are getting sold in English at a profit.

670
00:42:22,243 --> 00:42:30,759
Speaker 1: Maybe there's someone who cares about lady about some hotom on So kodancha who is also publishing like attack on Titan and Akira and stuff.

671
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:37,540
Speaker 1: You know, they're publishing for the first time queen emeraldus manga in English in the United States.

672
00:42:38,443 --> 00:42:40,910
Speaker 1: The first volume came out in a fancy hardcover.

673
00:42:41,332 --> 00:42:47,400
Speaker 1: I got it right away and I read it and then it made rim read it Yep, and I got to say I like it a lot.

674
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:52,800
Speaker 1: It's the same as watching a lady Matsumoto, you know anime only in manga form

675
00:42:53,171 --> 00:43:07,716
Speaker 0: Yep But you can emeraldus yourself because her character at least insofar as we've read this volume one of the manga is Just this stone-cold mysterious person who likes to murder people and give children guns.

676
00:43:07,736 --> 00:43:09,020
Speaker 1: She's the same characters.

677
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:11,362
Speaker 1: He is in all them, you know, yep That's the thing.

678
00:43:11,382 --> 00:43:17,951
Speaker 1: the lady Matsumoto universe is this weird thing where it's so consistent yet It's so unconsistent like it's thematically consistent.

679
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:22,700
Speaker 1: if you try to put its character consistent It's just not temporarily consistent right?

680
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:25,570
Speaker 1: if you try to put like events in order you can't.

681
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:38,467
Speaker 1: because as soon as you try to line up like any two separate things Even if you try to line up like Galaxy Express TV, you know movie one and movie two like I think are the only things that might line up kind of well with Each other but not even perfectly right?

682
00:43:38,487 --> 00:43:44,037
Speaker 1: It's like trying to line up the Harlock TV show and You know Galaxy Express TV show.

683
00:43:44,098 --> 00:43:45,762
Speaker 1: it's like What.

684
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:50,080
Speaker 1: or try to line up like Arcadia of my youth and any other Harlock thing ever?

685
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:51,792
Speaker 1: It's like it's like two jigsaw puzzles.

686
00:43:51,812 --> 00:44:00,300
Speaker 1: It's don't fit together Right, but there are certain things that are like facts and the facts of like don't change, right?

687
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:06,720
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, captain Harlock's deal is this and his deal is always the same general deal, right?

688
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:14,392
Speaker 0: It's like if someone made a new like blessed Semicanonical lady Matsumoto universe thing someday like even in the distant future.

689
00:44:15,074 --> 00:44:18,446
Speaker 0: as long as they maintain all those facts It'll still kind of work right?

690
00:44:18,487 --> 00:44:20,635
Speaker 1: It's like this is who emeraldus is.

691
00:44:20,675 --> 00:44:21,840
Speaker 1: This is her general deal.

692
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,727
Speaker 1: It's like the timeline of things doesn't make sense.

693
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:27,500
Speaker 1: They'll even tell like the same stories multiple times in different ways, right?

694
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,662
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you'll see I think there was a you know, Tochiro Is it?

695
00:44:32,682 --> 00:44:39,804
Speaker 1: does I forget what there's like two different movies where he becomes sort of one with the Arcadia and it's like well Which one of those is the?

696
00:44:40,005 --> 00:44:41,713
Speaker 1: you know, the fact is that he is it.

697
00:44:41,893 --> 00:44:43,380
Speaker 1: he is the ship basically, right?

698
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:48,409
Speaker 1: So that fact remains the same But how at what point did that happen?

699
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:57,220
Speaker 1: is totally different because that same story is told multiple times much like The Bible where you're gonna tell the same story ten times in ten different ways.

700
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, now we know the reason for that is the documentary hypothesis where right but regardless, right?

701
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,592
Speaker 1: That's how lady Matsumoto things are.

702
00:45:04,672 --> 00:45:09,900
Speaker 1: so here, you know We read about Queen emeraldus and there's some usual as it is with Matsumoto.

703
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,880
Speaker 1: There's some kid who we never heard of before and she takes a specific.

704
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:20,413
Speaker 0: He's basically the Tetsuro of this of this manga Except this one's a little more like she literally just comes out of the sky.

705
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:21,076
Speaker 0: It's like hey kid.

706
00:45:21,377 --> 00:45:21,860
Speaker 0: Here's a gun.

707
00:45:22,563 --> 00:45:24,052
Speaker 1: She gives a lot of guns to a lot of kids.

708
00:45:24,072 --> 00:45:26,781
Speaker 0: Not just her though, like Everybody.

709
00:45:27,082 --> 00:45:28,408
Speaker 0: just if a kid is like like.

710
00:45:28,428 --> 00:45:29,572
Speaker 0: they help a kid like hey kid.

711
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:30,637
Speaker 0: I got your back.

712
00:45:30,817 --> 00:45:31,480
Speaker 1: It's also interesting.

713
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:44,394
Speaker 1: She gives tochiro's gun to someone but it's like didn't test as a perfect example of the timeline not being correct, right in this manga she gives tochiro's gun to some kid and But meanwhile didn't Tetsuro end up with tochiro's gun and got it?

714
00:45:44,434 --> 00:45:45,598
Speaker 1: got it from tochiro's mom.

715
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:48,063
Speaker 1: well It doesn't line up.

716
00:45:48,244 --> 00:45:49,647
Speaker 0: emeraldus is immortal.

717
00:45:49,668 --> 00:45:51,472
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

718
00:45:51,893 --> 00:45:53,056
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure she's immortal.

719
00:45:53,778 --> 00:45:54,500
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

720
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:55,484
Speaker 0: She's immortal for now.

721
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:59,319
Speaker 0: She hasn't finished her whatever yet whatever she's doing how whatever reason that she's a.

722
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,060
Speaker 1: You're saying that this happens.

723
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:07,877
Speaker 1: Well after the events of Galaxy Express and she got the gun back from Tetsuro after he died or way before.

724
00:46:07,997 --> 00:46:11,566
Speaker 1: she already knows How did the if it's way before.

725
00:46:11,826 --> 00:46:14,273
Speaker 1: how did the gun get back to tochiro's mom?

726
00:46:14,413 --> 00:46:16,780
Speaker 1: cuz it's all a loop right now.

727
00:46:17,061 --> 00:46:17,785
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

728
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,039
Speaker 0: Why was the ship called emeraldus?

729
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,532
Speaker 0: Because it was yeah, even she's like.

730
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:33,126
Speaker 0: that seems like a crazy coincidence But it does make sense at least that you know they portray her as being immortal in that you know Everyone's afraid of her.

731
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:35,379
Speaker 0: everyone knows her legend wouldn't you be?

732
00:46:36,741 --> 00:46:37,999
Speaker 0: She only kills you if you deserve it.

733
00:46:38,961 --> 00:46:46,018
Speaker 1: The one thing that no Matsumoto work focuses on is that you have a lot that focuses on these characters like Harlock and emeraldus.

734
00:46:46,058 --> 00:46:46,318
Speaker 1: and what?

735
00:46:46,399 --> 00:46:46,820
Speaker 1: or and who?

736
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,490
Speaker 1: Are infamous throughout the galaxy or multiple galaxies?

737
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:57,995
Speaker 1: right the Galaxy Express goes to Andromeda, so it's at least two galaxies And these people are infamous everywhere like everyone who travels in space knows who they are.

738
00:46:58,075 --> 00:46:59,500
Speaker 1: even people who don't travel in space know who?

739
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:04,112
Speaker 0: They are find some random speechless dinosaur and be like blah blah blah Harlock, and it'll be like Harlock.

740
00:47:04,193 --> 00:47:06,820
Speaker 1: no, but space is big.

741
00:47:07,841 --> 00:47:13,740
Speaker 1: You got to be really dangerous and really famous to be known throughout all of fucking space, right?

742
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:21,775
Speaker 1: It's like it's a big deal to be famous on Earth or even just part of it to be famous and infamous across space Whoa?

743
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:23,244
Speaker 1: It's like.

744
00:47:23,264 --> 00:47:25,034
Speaker 1: they don't focus on how big a deal.

745
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:25,920
Speaker 1: that is enough.

746
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:30,072
Speaker 0: But I do appreciate like the way this one starts in the very beginning is.

747
00:47:30,313 --> 00:47:33,886
Speaker 0: you know she appears and there's that hot guy Who's like a bounty hunter?

748
00:47:33,926 --> 00:47:34,268
Speaker 0: Who's like?

749
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:39,120
Speaker 0: I'm max something max the wall And she shoots him immediately.

750
00:47:39,861 --> 00:47:40,847
Speaker 0: But do that's?

751
00:47:40,928 --> 00:47:46,900
Speaker 1: I mean that's another common theme in all Matsumoto things that in space if you want to survive just fucking shoot first.

752
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,845
Speaker 0: Yep, never wound an enemy.

753
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,773
Speaker 0: always kill anyone you fight with otherwise.

754
00:47:51,813 --> 00:47:54,380
Speaker 1: They'll seek revenge right when they give Tetsuro a gun.

755
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,900
Speaker 1: It's like Tetsuro listen you want to survive in space and make it to Andromeda.

756
00:47:58,281 --> 00:48:00,246
Speaker 0: She gives him a gun to fucking shoot people.

757
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:02,633
Speaker 0: the kid the the bartender gives him a gun.

758
00:48:02,954 --> 00:48:05,120
Speaker 0: someone else gives this other kid a gun.

759
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,460
Speaker 0: I think he gives a kid a gun at one point.

760
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:10,749
Speaker 0: Everyone gives kids guns in this book never adults as always.

761
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:11,752
Speaker 0: I'm an adult.

762
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:12,634
Speaker 0: You're a kid.

763
00:48:12,654 --> 00:48:14,038
Speaker 0: Here's your gun.

764
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,847
Speaker 1: That's right Kid I feel bad for you.

765
00:48:16,887 --> 00:48:18,215
Speaker 1: I want you to succeed in space.

766
00:48:18,235 --> 00:48:18,979
Speaker 1: You're gonna need a gun.

767
00:48:19,321 --> 00:48:22,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you're a little kid and otherwise you're just gonna be also the guy.

768
00:48:22,618 --> 00:48:26,159
Speaker 0: in the beginning I feel like the rules of space are a lot like the rule of the playground.

769
00:48:27,081 --> 00:48:27,843
Speaker 0: Well, you gotta remember.

770
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,207
Speaker 0: There's also the space.

771
00:48:29,548 --> 00:48:32,296
Speaker 0: is that good blah blah and kids like.

772
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:33,560
Speaker 0: so why don't we throw the captain out?

773
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:39,728
Speaker 0: Well, the rule of space is also that you can't throw the captain out So I'm gonna kill you and like that.

774
00:48:39,748 --> 00:48:43,179
Speaker 0: the rule of space really is just kill anybody who's in your way no matter what?

775
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:49,800
Speaker 0: What was the guide like midway through who just murders everyone in that bar and the bartender's like man?

776
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,887
Speaker 0: That guy's so annoying.

777
00:48:50,907 --> 00:48:52,639
Speaker 0: I wish someone would do something about him.

778
00:48:53,282 --> 00:48:54,466
Speaker 1: I also got you know, you got to remember.

779
00:48:54,506 --> 00:48:57,940
Speaker 1: part of this shooting thing right is because Matsumoto is like a military gun.

780
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:07,508
Speaker 1: You know otaku right, but you know one of the first things he did like in 1972 He did gun frontier Right, which is the guns which is.

781
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:10,540
Speaker 1: captain Harlock is a in a Western, right?

782
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,907
Speaker 1: So it's basically, you know, that's what Matsumoto does.

783
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:16,840
Speaker 1: he portrays space as a Western which is why you're just shooting people.

784
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,275
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's a Western with a trackless.

785
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:19,980
Speaker 0: It's just a right.

786
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,674
Speaker 1: It's just instead of instead of how to survive in the Old West kid.

787
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,400
Speaker 1: You're gonna need to shoot people survive in space.

788
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,612
Speaker 1: They just replace Old West with space and in gun frontier is.

789
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,820
Speaker 1: it is literally just a planet in space.

790
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,139
Speaker 1: That is like the Old West, you know, so.

791
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,837
Speaker 1: But actually I think that in gun frontier, it's like.

792
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:41,933
Speaker 1: actually Totoro is like the main character and Harlock is a sidekick.

793
00:49:42,515 --> 00:49:43,137
Speaker 1: It's kind of it's.

794
00:49:43,278 --> 00:49:43,900
Speaker 1: you should check it out.

795
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,462
Speaker 1: That's like.

796
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:48,300
Speaker 1: I think it's one of the only things like focuses on Totoro more and everything else.

797
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:57,559
Speaker 1: Totoro is like this mysterious, you know already dead soon-to-be-dead hiding and someone's looking for like in this one Emerald is like looking for him obviously, right?

798
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,714
Speaker 1: But he's like I'm looking for someone and I can't say and I'm like.

799
00:50:00,774 --> 00:50:01,960
Speaker 1: I've seen other Matsumoto things.

800
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,205
Speaker 1: I know it's Totoro that you're looking.

801
00:50:03,225 --> 00:50:05,172
Speaker 1: Yeah, it can't be anyone else.

802
00:50:05,534 --> 00:50:06,558
Speaker 1: Who else would you look for?

803
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:06,759
Speaker 1: Nobody?

804
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,066
Speaker 1: There's no one else you even know.

805
00:50:09,086 --> 00:50:11,660
Speaker 0: Yep, but she's mysterious.

806
00:50:12,061 --> 00:50:18,860
Speaker 0: She won't tell anyone her deal except this kid and once she tells him she's gonna kill it.

807
00:50:19,261 --> 00:50:19,784
Speaker 1: That's the part.

808
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:20,045
Speaker 1: I don't.

809
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:23,160
Speaker 1: that's actually I don't know is like why does she have to kill?

810
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,680
Speaker 1: Why is she helping him if she knows she's gonna have to kill him someday?

811
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,340
Speaker 0: Well, there are at least now two and why will she have to kill him?

812
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:40,826
Speaker 0: There are now two Leiji Matsumoto stories where Wayfish blonde woman with power comes from the sky leads a kid on an epic journey Only to then betray and/or kill him or at least That's what they're going to do.

813
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:42,815
Speaker 1: It's Queen millennia, which is also that story.

814
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:45,898
Speaker 1: Okay, so three That's that's the story he tells.

815
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:48,746
Speaker 1: That's what you get.

816
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:51,240
Speaker 0: it's not a bad story though, right?

817
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,352
Speaker 1: I mean space battleship Yamato is only different and that there's no kid.

818
00:50:54,412 --> 00:50:56,259
Speaker 1: It's all of them go in her ship together.

819
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:00,511
Speaker 1: It's like everyone together let's go and all the other ones are.

820
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:07,040
Speaker 0: a little kid has to go and a woman takes it All right The captain who's about to kill him and then he reaches for his gun and it's not like he dropped it.

821
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,187
Speaker 0: He's like, oh wait My gun fell out of my holster.

822
00:51:10,307 --> 00:51:11,051
Speaker 0: I'm unarmed.

823
00:51:11,392 --> 00:51:15,666
Speaker 0: that violates the law of space BAM and he just shoots him in the gut.

824
00:51:15,847 --> 00:51:16,910
Speaker 1: That's the law of space.

825
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:18,676
Speaker 1: Yeah shoot him first.

826
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,400
Speaker 0: I Like how the kids kind of like a little bit of a shithead, right?

827
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,215
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, Tetsuro is sort of like, you know brave.

828
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:30,920
Speaker 1: he's like he like he want, you know He wants to avenge, you know, his murdered mother, right?

829
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,289
Speaker 1: I guess he has a like a noble purpose.

830
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,081
Speaker 0: almost right story is also known from the beginning Like.

831
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:37,990
Speaker 0: we know why he's mad like we know his back.

832
00:51:38,191 --> 00:51:42,250
Speaker 1: He's so small at the beginning to his little potato Yeah, but this kid was his name Ushio.

833
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:53,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, whatever his name is I care about him a lot less than Tetsuro and I like him less than Tetsuro because he's just sort of angry Like he just wants to build a spaceship to go into space and you don't know why.

834
00:51:53,294 --> 00:51:57,788
Speaker 1: and maybe if we find out why maybe He probably has a Tetsuro similar tragic story.

835
00:51:57,808 --> 00:51:59,132
Speaker 1: That'll make you like he.

836
00:51:59,193 --> 00:52:03,547
Speaker 0: obviously there's a flashback where he was reliving his memories And his mom was just hoping he'd die.

837
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,736
Speaker 0: and there was all that nonsense with the money, right?

838
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,735
Speaker 1: But you know Tetsuro like, you know, so he liked his parents.

839
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:10,760
Speaker 1: They got killed horribly.

840
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,746
Speaker 0: This is depending on what year this is.

841
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,331
Speaker 0: in the Legio Matsumoto verse.

842
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:17,100
Speaker 0: I mean how many humans are there versus immortals?

843
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,348
Speaker 0: I mean he says he's from earth.

844
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:20,863
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Mean there was.

845
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:23,660
Speaker 1: you could be on earth in you know, all of them pretty much, right?

846
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, earth is a very different place though.

847
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:28,500
Speaker 0: Maybe depending which part of you might be a real bad place.

848
00:52:29,322 --> 00:52:38,192
Speaker 1: I think earth was the worst place like the beginning of the second Galaxy Express movie where there's like a it's like a Cyberdystopia and there's an act of rebellion everywhere.

849
00:52:38,212 --> 00:52:45,178
Speaker 1: Yeah Humans versus robot people just shooting in the streets all the time, you know, we can fix that problem with the dirty humes.

850
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:55,569
Speaker 0: Yeah But the killer I don't know if you if you haven't read any lazy Matsumoto stuff at all or watched any yeah Maybe just start with this.

851
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:56,815
Speaker 1: you can start with anything.

852
00:52:56,835 --> 00:53:00,300
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter It's the same story crook slightly.

853
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,360
Speaker 0: So I would say if you want a long show to watch just start watching Galaxy Express.

854
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,880
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I actually think the first thing to watch is space battleship, right?

855
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:14,000
Speaker 1: Cuz if you if you watch that you're starting like that doesn't connect as much with other things.

856
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:19,747
Speaker 1: And I think it's the earliest thing not necessarily in terms of timeline But in terms of period.

857
00:53:19,868 --> 00:53:25,449
Speaker 0: but I feel like the average like anime manga fan in America At least if you know who even know who Matsumoto is.

858
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:34,319
Speaker 1: you vaguely imagine all the things that look like this Yep, there's a tall blonde girl and if it looks like if it looks like interstellar 555, that's who it is.

859
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:36,720
Speaker 0: Everyone's got a scar and everyone's brooding.

860
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:51,476
Speaker 0: I Don't know I just I really like lazy Matsumoto nonsense, but it's kind of Disposable in that it's all just this sort of cycling vague stories about men standing and being.

861
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:54,069
Speaker 1: it's like once you've seen enough You've seen them all right.

862
00:53:54,129 --> 00:53:55,379
Speaker 1: So you just have to see enough.

863
00:53:56,122 --> 00:54:00,518
Speaker 1: But enough is quite a bit right because there is a significant variation that goes on.

864
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:07,774
Speaker 0: Yep well, this volume at least in this manga has a good bit of the Really silly nonsense and they're ridiculous melodrama as well.

865
00:54:07,814 --> 00:54:09,964
Speaker 0: Like that's all there everyone This kid meets.

866
00:54:10,024 --> 00:54:13,120
Speaker 0: it's like go on I will die or whatever.

867
00:54:13,301 --> 00:54:19,661
Speaker 0: But I see that you will go on to do the thing that you want to do and I want you to do that Right.

868
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:23,794
Speaker 1: I mean in Galaxy Express Tetsuro goes from planet to planet on the train.

869
00:54:23,834 --> 00:54:23,975
Speaker 0: have?

870
00:54:24,015 --> 00:54:25,279
Speaker 0: those planets are like fuck you.

871
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:36,779
Speaker 1: Each planet is like some moral dilemma and conflict and they have to run back to the train on time Existential crisis at that moment and each planet is like a totally different episodic deal in this.

872
00:54:37,645 --> 00:54:43,600
Speaker 1: Instead of going for planets a planet on the train He's trying to build a ship and his ship crashes into every planet, right?

873
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,300
Speaker 1: He just he builds he fixes his ship and then manages to get to another plan.

874
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:53,040
Speaker 1: Then he crashes where he finds another problem and that until he can manage to take off and get back into space again.

875
00:54:53,221 --> 00:55:00,540
Speaker 0: but in Galaxy Express them landing sort of Catalyzes the transformation of the planet for good or bad, right?

876
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:05,140
Speaker 1: I mean if you're on a planet and the Galaxy Express alert arrives fuck just like the robot carnival show.

877
00:55:05,281 --> 00:55:05,582
Speaker 1: It's like.

878
00:55:05,663 --> 00:55:11,176
Speaker 1: it's like the the you know, the news of the century like oh my god the trains here Holy shit.

879
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:15,957
Speaker 1: If it's an express, why did it stop at our backwater planet which is like a movie?

880
00:55:15,977 --> 00:55:16,400
Speaker 0: what's happening?

881
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,207
Speaker 1: Is that why the movie makes more sense?

882
00:55:18,247 --> 00:55:21,100
Speaker 1: Cuz in the movie they get to Andromeda real fast like a real Express.

883
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:22,385
Speaker 0: Well, it's an Express.

884
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,670
Speaker 0: It's only stopping at the big planets.

885
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:26,160
Speaker 0: The local probably takes like a thousand years to get to the end.

886
00:55:27,461 --> 00:55:28,545
Speaker 1: Every planet along the way.

887
00:55:28,565 --> 00:55:29,027
Speaker 1: TV show.

888
00:55:29,087 --> 00:55:30,573
Speaker 1: it stops all the local planets.

889
00:55:30,854 --> 00:55:31,516
Speaker 0: I don't know.

890
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,204
Speaker 0: Maybe there's more planets I don't know.

891
00:55:33,386 --> 00:55:34,897
Speaker 0: the TV show the galaxy local.

892
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:35,320
Speaker 0: nine nine.

893
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:41,118
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, this is good stuff.

894
00:55:42,401 --> 00:55:46,420
Speaker 1: I'm just happy there's some you know, we'll get to read some Matsumoto manga's in English easily.

895
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:48,971
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hope that they go and get all the other ones.

896
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:53,639
Speaker 1: if we enough of us buy this one I like a hardcover and put in the extra bits.

897
00:55:54,041 --> 00:56:09,698
Speaker 0: this is it's following the sort of back and forth where it's like 50% the kid doing his stuff and Everyone like pat him on the back giving him a gun and then dying to push him forward even though they just met him Except that one girl who doesn't murder him, but then she gets what's coming to her.

898
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:15,473
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, you've got 50% emerald is being mysterious and push.

899
00:56:15,533 --> 00:56:18,200
Speaker 1: if it was a hundred percent emerald issue wouldn't be mysterious, right?

900
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,558
Speaker 1: That's how it has to be right.

901
00:56:19,578 --> 00:56:31,253
Speaker 1: you Keep the secretive may tell or the secret of Harlock if like you're focusing on them all the time You got to focus on all the other people and then the mysterious awesome Powerful character has to almost be like this force of nature that comes through.

902
00:56:31,273 --> 00:56:41,080
Speaker 0: but I feel like she is more Powerful than some of those other people at least in terms of she doesn't resolve situations with even a modicum of danger.

903
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:45,460
Speaker 0: She's like D and vampire hunter D. Yeah, which nothing wrong with that.

904
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,245
Speaker 0: I love the hell out of vampire hunter D Even though the plot is literally.

905
00:56:48,265 --> 00:56:53,146
Speaker 0: D wins a fight because he's stronger and then he wins another fight because he's stronger and then up He's gonna lose a fight.

906
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:53,953
Speaker 0: Nope turned out.

907
00:56:53,973 --> 00:56:54,517
Speaker 0: He was stronger.

908
00:56:54,558 --> 00:57:04,307
Speaker 1: the end If you're infamous throughout space that's about as strong as you have to be yup and To not be dead where everyone's just shooting everybody.
