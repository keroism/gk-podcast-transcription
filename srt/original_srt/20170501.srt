1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,632
Speaker 1: It's Monday May 1st 2017.

2
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:22,499
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight Drm because I guess we never did a show on this in the last 12 years.

3
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,620
Speaker 1: I can't Can't find one in the database.

4
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:27,937
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:31,594
Speaker 1: This is the second time in recent memory.

6
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:34,231
Speaker 1: one of us said hey Why don't we do a show on X?

7
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,240
Speaker 1: and the other one said?

8
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:42,386
Speaker 1: We have definitely done a show on X and the first one agreed and then in searching the database There wasn't one.

9
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:42,928
Speaker 1: there has to be.

10
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:44,193
Speaker 1: I can't find one.

11
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:48,328
Speaker 1: if you find a show we did Specifically about digital rights management.

12
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,917
Speaker 1: My head is off to you and I will eat my hat.

13
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:52,389
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm You know all your hats.

14
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:55,108
Speaker 1: I'm not eating all my heads.

15
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:58,972
Speaker 0: I will eat a hat which head Have a area.

16
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:04,215
Speaker 0: I'm sort of small your leather cowboy hat that you from the RIT days.

17
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,420
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's good hat.

18
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:06,222
Speaker 1: I like that hat.

19
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:06,684
Speaker 0: eat it.

20
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:07,687
Speaker 0: It's right edible.

21
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:08,410
Speaker 0: It's leathery, right?

22
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, you drive to boil it.

23
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,220
Speaker 0: Sure boiling is fine.

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,095
Speaker 1: I'd probably better off eating that hat than eating the felt hat.

25
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:15,060
Speaker 0: That's I'm saying.

26
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:24,579
Speaker 0: Anyway, so remember the last time we did a Monday show I talked about my computer That was blue screen and how I replaced the motherboard and then it still was blue screen in.

27
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:26,367
Speaker 0: yeah I remember that and I was upset.

28
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:28,840
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, why did I waste my time updating the motherboard?

29
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,944
Speaker 0: Wasn't actually the problem.

30
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:33,672
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I was like, oh well, you know, it could.

31
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:34,936
Speaker 0: what was it was this?

32
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,558
Speaker 0: was it that?

33
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,961
Speaker 0: so I Removed.

34
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:42,817
Speaker 0: I had two SSDs in my computer the old one, which is the first SSD I ever bought.

35
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:47,554
Speaker 0: It's like maybe Four years old something like that four or five years old.

36
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,156
Speaker 0: I don't know.

37
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,983
Speaker 0: it's old The old one.

38
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:54,616
Speaker 0: and then there's a newer one that I have that I bought more recently that's the Samsung one.

39
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:55,740
Speaker 0: that's better right now.

40
00:01:56,861 --> 00:02:01,012
Speaker 0: So that old one is now relegated just being like the scratch drive.

41
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:03,479
Speaker 1: right that's what I've been doing with my old 32 gigabyte.

42
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,873
Speaker 0: So it's only used when I'm like using Adobe stuff.

43
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:08,360
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's not being used at all.

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,040
Speaker 0: It's just in there with no data being written to yep or from it whatsoever.

45
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:18,880
Speaker 1: So, you know I've noticed because I have a my giant like multi terabyte like many terabyte drive.

46
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:22,379
Speaker 1: I set it up to our only Adobe stuff and static media is on it.

47
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:27,760
Speaker 1: So it literally if I ever like start an Adobe project I hear that drive spin up.

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,167
Speaker 0: The point is this old SSD that was in there.

49
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:38,618
Speaker 0: of the two SSDs I had I unplugged it because number one I hardly use it except when I'm Adobe ink so it doesn't matter if it's unplugged too much.

50
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:42,253
Speaker 0: and B Was it really the cause of blue screens?

51
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:43,218
Speaker 0: Well, I can tell you.

52
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,653
Speaker 0: Since unplugging it two plus weeks ago.

53
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:51,305
Speaker 1: I have had Zero Blue screens.

54
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,670
Speaker 1: I would not have predicted that.

55
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:55,180
Speaker 0: Okay, this makes this is new to me, right?

56
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:02,380
Speaker 0: How can an SSD a drive a storage drive that is merely plugged into a computer that is not being used?

57
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:04,077
Speaker 0: No data written to or from it?

58
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:12,000
Speaker 0: How can that cause blue screens so frequently while the computer is doing other unrelated things not even accessing that drive?

59
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,949
Speaker 0: that could make sense if say the SAT a controller on the board was busted.

60
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:24,000
Speaker 0: that might cause blue screens, but we changed motherboards Yeah, and we were having blue screens on both of them.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,480
Speaker 0: It would make sense if the GPU is causing blue screens and these blue screens were having Various error messages of all shapes and sizes not one consistent error.

62
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,339
Speaker 1: I got some guesses I think but it's all it wasn't.

63
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:45,240
Speaker 0: My RAM tests were always like a plus your RAM is totally good and my RAM was totally good You know, but I was just because RAM makes more sense for a blue screen.

64
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:46,720
Speaker 1: It was like the primary cause.

65
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:50,140
Speaker 0: Take would have made so much more sense for these random blue screens.

66
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,450
Speaker 1: But so here's my guess cuz you gotta use its process of eliminations.

67
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,087
Speaker 0: since that old bud busted SSD has been removed No blue screens.

68
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,860
Speaker 0: I should put it in someone's computer and see if it makes blue screens.

69
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:10,656
Speaker 1: So it's not data coming on or off of that drive obviously And it's probably not something like physical on the motherboard is one of the odds.

70
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:12,200
Speaker 1: you have two mother two motherboards are the same.

71
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:20,680
Speaker 1: Right, so either that drive Way because even though you're not accessing it the SATA controller still like initializes it or whatever.

72
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:24,636
Speaker 0: Like I'm gonna crash just like rent sometimes for a long time.

73
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:25,600
Speaker 0: Sometimes a short time.

74
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:33,098
Speaker 1: So maybe if it has a internal problem where occasionally it'll send spurious voltages up that SATA cable.

75
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:38,754
Speaker 1: I Could be that's already a pretty like esoteric impossible to troubleshoot.

76
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:40,360
Speaker 0: probably shouldn't it not cut like.

77
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,732
Speaker 0: There should be some fault detection and protection.

78
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:58,060
Speaker 1: it should be some protection in the motherboard Protection in the code to say hey don't crash in the half No But you can't put that everywhere because like putting voltage protection one can cause problems with bandwidth, especially like high-speed things uses.

79
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:05,680
Speaker 1: Yeah old invention uses introduce latency and trouble depending on how they could say they're also big.

80
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:18,412
Speaker 1: Generally, you only protect like the power in places where you're likely to get weird power situations like from the power supply Yeah, but not from like a SATA cable plugged into a hard drive.

81
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:21,400
Speaker 0: Oh, it could have been also maybe on the power.

82
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:30,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing would be it might have a problem where it over and under draws or just something weird causing the PSU to Have a momentary fault.

83
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,740
Speaker 1: that then causes the system to get unstable.

84
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:34,892
Speaker 1: Those are both stretches.

85
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:35,559
Speaker 1: That's weird.

86
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:37,443
Speaker 1: We should.

87
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:38,227
Speaker 1: we should put you know what?

88
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:39,534
Speaker 1: I got a couple extra computers.

89
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:40,680
Speaker 1: Give me the drive.

90
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:42,690
Speaker 1: I'll just plug it into my HTTP.

91
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:44,720
Speaker 1: see out there and see if it blue screens.

92
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,774
Speaker 0: All right, just you got to keep running for a while.

93
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:47,177
Speaker 0: See you happen.

94
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:47,540
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

95
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,450
Speaker 0: So cuz the thing is the drive never misbehaved.

96
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:52,137
Speaker 0: every time I wrote data to it it worked.

97
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,080
Speaker 0: every time I like that drive.

98
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,380
Speaker 1: You had an RIT that had that one sector where you hear the you hear it like have a platter.

99
00:05:58,202 --> 00:05:58,866
Speaker 0: It's an SSD.

100
00:05:58,886 --> 00:05:59,449
Speaker 0: That can't happen.

101
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that you had an old hard drive.

102
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:04,589
Speaker 1: Using this drive.

103
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:12,397
Speaker 0: it appears to be a perfectly functioning 128 gigabyte SSD and it did not cause blue screens until you know, whenever.

104
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:18,280
Speaker 1: yeah Oh my god Linkiji in the chat had a hard a laptop hard drive that was like plug-and-play key.

105
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,950
Speaker 1: Oh, you can unplug it an external one.

106
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,272
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:26,564
Speaker 1: He would get a blue screen Reliably about an hour after he unplugged it Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:31,160
Speaker 1: So I don't know, you know, it's kind of an old motherboard in terms of like it's from an era.

109
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,280
Speaker 1: Maybe SATA controllers are a little less for a bus back.

110
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:36,367
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I'm saying is this drive?

111
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:40,260
Speaker 0: this SSD is a Corsair brand SSD from way back.

112
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:46,280
Speaker 0: So I can't imagine this would be a problem for anyone buying new SSDs and you're only buying Samsung ones these days.

113
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,543
Speaker 0: Right, so, you know our Intel ones which are fine But slower.

114
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:53,737
Speaker 1: because I had an SSD go through the traditional failure recently my old 2009 laptop.

115
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,961
Speaker 1: I had to replace its you know, one SSD that I paid a lot of money for in 2009.

116
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, that drive was not cheap when I bought it.

117
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:08,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, this old 32 gig SSD just like Windows like I go to play a video at a con and then Windows.

118
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,871
Speaker 1: It's just like some libraries are missing.

119
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:12,076
Speaker 1: So I'm like, okay, that's weird.

120
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:12,679
Speaker 1: I'll just use VLC.

121
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,134
Speaker 1: I run VLC and the VLC complains about some DLL files having a problem.

122
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:24,737
Speaker 1: and a little bit more investigation I think half that file system had single bit errors like just littered throughout it.

123
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,206
Speaker 1: scan disk Yeah, and scan disk crash.

124
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,490
Speaker 1: No, I tried it again.

125
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,577
Speaker 1: scan disk crash and I gave up.

126
00:07:31,597 --> 00:07:33,461
Speaker 1: and I just bought a new hard drive FSCK.

127
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,770
Speaker 1: yeah, and when I'm once I put the new hard drive in one.

128
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:39,358
Speaker 1: modern SSDs are way faster than old SSDs.

129
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,425
Speaker 1: Yes, and to the laptop?

130
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:42,348
Speaker 1: is this SSD?

131
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:44,637
Speaker 0: even those old was still six gigabit per second.

132
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:45,280
Speaker 0: SSDs.

133
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know but there.

134
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,023
Speaker 1: but while they have six gigabit, you know They're they use that standard.

135
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:56,867
Speaker 1: old SSDs tend to actually have pretty low or pretty high latency Compared to what modern SSDs do like.

136
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,135
Speaker 0: I expect that SSD like, you know fail in the way.

137
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:01,302
Speaker 0: an SSD fails where it starts running Out of sectors.

138
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:02,004
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you start.

139
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:08,520
Speaker 0: I don't expect it to randomly blue-screen your computer with no indications that it was the SSDs fault In any of the error messages anywhere.

140
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,893
Speaker 1: So what's interesting is in old computers like but like.

141
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:17,070
Speaker 1: I think the 486 was the end of this era Where like when I bought my first 46 my family about one.

142
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:23,028
Speaker 1: it came with a manual and the manual actually even went down to Voltages and pin outs and like motherboard diagrams.

143
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:33,394
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a holdover because before then you'd be buying computers like, you know Coleco's not Coleco's Radio Shack Coco - or a Tandy something.

144
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:37,390
Speaker 0: or you know Even Apple Apple twos and Amigas.

145
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,514
Speaker 0: they all came with those things.

146
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:41,063
Speaker 0: even the stereo that I bought It was like, you know, they.

147
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:46,950
Speaker 0: it was like a piece of furniture that had two giant speakers and a turntable and you know Dual cassette decks were dubbing or whatever.

148
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:49,240
Speaker 0: that came with a complete circuit diagram.

149
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,223
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a thing.

150
00:08:50,343 --> 00:09:01,200
Speaker 0: all electronics that you also be able to throw a long up until like, you know early mid 90s Every time you bought some piece of electronics it came with like a complete circuit diagram.

151
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,324
Speaker 0: It was just the thing.

152
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:09,380
Speaker 1: the physicality of what you were doing with electricity and older computers Was a lot simpler like when I was at RIT, this wasn't that long ago, right?

153
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:17,169
Speaker 1: one of the early classes we took that was actually interesting was all about signal processing and We spent a lot of time learning about all the different networking standards.

154
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:27,339
Speaker 1: and like buses like computer buses and the actual token ring physical electrical Signaling like here is the kind of wave like, you know differential Manchester or whatever.

155
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:34,240
Speaker 1: What is used in modern networking is so much more complicated than that stuff that all of that knowledge is literally worthless today.

156
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,294
Speaker 0: But then I mean gigabit ethernet isn't just the same thing only fast.

157
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:41,511
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, no No, so yeah, like Manchester encoding is pretty.

158
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,498
Speaker 0: that was that was from the 10 megabit days.

159
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:49,407
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, and we and actually like we're old enough at RIT Literally use 10 base - yeah.

160
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,094
Speaker 1: and token ring.

161
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,420
Speaker 0: so I didn't use token ring.

162
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,669
Speaker 0: I used 10 and 100. but now we're using gigabit.

163
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,882
Speaker 1: Yeah You didn't use the 10 base - with the with the vampire clamps or no 10 bed the 10 base 5.

164
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:02,460
Speaker 1: There was the one with the thick coax cable.

165
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,633
Speaker 1: You shove these vampire clamps in to make basically a ghetto hub now.

166
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,438
Speaker 1: and then the other one was the tees.

167
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,584
Speaker 1: we get the tea Junctions the back.

168
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:10,208
Speaker 1: Yes, computer.

169
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:16,280
Speaker 1: That's 10 base - okay tees You're like twist it in and in and then you got to have a terminator on that last computer.

170
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:19,205
Speaker 1: I've seen those Yeah stuff's all obsolete.

171
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:31,644
Speaker 1: But my point is that back then in those classes I took we could literally plug oscilloscopes or other devices into network cables and by looking at waveforms and using like voltimeters Troubleshoot problems.

172
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:36,398
Speaker 1: I don't think it's feasible to do that kind of troubleshooting on modern computers.

173
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:42,179
Speaker 1: too much data Yeah and the kind of equipment you would need that would be sensitive enough is probably out of the realm.

174
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:48,444
Speaker 1: like Flukes are not even cheap and modern flukes are probably way more expensive even Good times.

175
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:51,056
Speaker 1: So, uh, I was this weekend at Zenkai con.

176
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:51,920
Speaker 1: I did three panels.

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,750
Speaker 1: So if any of you are here because you saw those panels a lot of people were really, you know That's not an audience that typically sees our stuff.

178
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:14,860
Speaker 1: most of the people in these mostly full rooms No idea who I was and only one person walked out and I think they had to go to the bathroom based on their body Language, so it was a good time, but I got to tell you Zenkai con is great and I have a lot of fun there.

179
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,688
Speaker 1: independent of that Lancaster got a Lancaster.

180
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,855
Speaker 0: That's why I don't go there.

181
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:30,470
Speaker 1: It is the only city I have been to in my entire life where a City, it's just technically a city village.

182
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:38,458
Speaker 1: people on the street townies will come up to strangers and have adversarial interactions with them.

183
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:41,130
Speaker 1: and But they are not actually panhandling.

184
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,060
Speaker 1: They're just being aggressive over nothing.

185
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:52,687
Speaker 1: I had people just like bothering us and like like random people will come up to you and just say Unintelligible things to you regularly, but none of them are panhandling.

186
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:56,980
Speaker 1: They're just townies living there accosting strangers who came to town.

187
00:11:57,242 --> 00:12:02,730
Speaker 0: They say uh, she's just walking down the street and someone comes He'll walk up to you and a lot of them would.

188
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:09,616
Speaker 1: some of them were just asked like what's going on with the freak show What's up with all the costume weirdos, but some of them would just say gibberish like.

189
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:11,042
Speaker 1: I did not understand What.

190
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:11,625
Speaker 1: a lot of them is.

191
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:15,165
Speaker 0: not just crazy, Pennsylvania sticks accent But you know what?

192
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:17,374
Speaker 1: It might be my guess not not to be.

193
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:18,660
Speaker 0: Hey, can I get a glass of water?

194
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:26,782
Speaker 1: If I had to guess to paraphrase someone else who was in our group the spice must flow Mm-hmm.

195
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:30,340
Speaker 1: So I suspect it might have been some spice and or met that was going on.

196
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:33,814
Speaker 0: That is a problem in much of this country.

197
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:39,880
Speaker 0: a lot of the people who are People keep talking about how this meth is a problem and I don't want to talk too long about this cuz Monday.

198
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:42,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, let me just say isn't that a problem that solves itself.

199
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:42,870
Speaker 1: Really?

200
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,095
Speaker 1: Yeah.

201
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:44,797
Speaker 1: No because it doesn't.

202
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:52,096
Speaker 1: so It takes too long to have that super dark timeline outcome that you're alluding to.

203
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:53,540
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe I should get it on this.

204
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,748
Speaker 0: I Get a long time before.

205
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:02,620
Speaker 1: Also, like meth is just an amphetamine and amphetamines have their own problems.

206
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:10,608
Speaker 1: There's a separate problem of you know, unclean meth made in bathtubs or whatever, but I mean we had that problem with cheese, too Yeah, but in general should I avoid cheese?

207
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:20,220
Speaker 1: in general stimulants like that have a lot of Positive by some definitions effects and a lot of negative by all definitions effects.

208
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:29,580
Speaker 1: So like, you know during World War two like both us and the Germans and a lot of the armies Just gave meth to soldiers like all the time if he made a YouTube video of doing meth.

209
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:31,163
Speaker 0: Was that not allowed?

210
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:32,567
Speaker 0: I do.

211
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,040
Speaker 0: I do not want to try crystal meth, but you were the one who was gonna try it.

212
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,433
Speaker 0: I don't even drink alcohol.

213
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:40,479
Speaker 0: You're the one who has to do the best.

214
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:51,580
Speaker 1: But to otherwise the con was great but there was a moment on Friday night It was like midnight and we we went to have some drinks for hanging out.

215
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:56,800
Speaker 1: So all of us are walking back to our hotel, which is like we're just like north of the train station.

216
00:13:57,442 --> 00:14:03,040
Speaker 1: So we're walking through town and we see these two guys and they see us and they all hey and start running at us.

217
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:18,120
Speaker 1: so we brace for impact and then they pull up and they're just like the most stereotypical like live-in Philly dudes and The discourse we had with them boiled down to yo you look like you from around here.

218
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:22,240
Speaker 1: Where the fuck can a man get some food in this country ass town?

219
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,391
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I were they in that country ass town.

220
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:26,555
Speaker 1: It was their first zenk icon.

221
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:27,680
Speaker 0: Why were they in zenk icon?

222
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,867
Speaker 1: Cause zenk icon is pretty fun.

223
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,360
Speaker 1: I don't know why you're so down on zenk icon.

224
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:36,438
Speaker 1: I played more tabletop games with quality people at this zenk icon than I did at the last Pac South.

225
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,703
Speaker 1: Sure We just did nothing but play Pac South.

226
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:41,687
Speaker 0: you got other shit to do.

227
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:42,288
Speaker 0: Like what?

228
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:45,940
Speaker 1: What did you do at Pac South other than play tabletop games?

229
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,570
Speaker 1: We were other than running your panel, which I also did.

230
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,687
Speaker 0: Ate food, walked around an expo hall Played some games that weren't tabletop games.

231
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:55,229
Speaker 1: Like what?

232
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:01,604
Speaker 0: Name one Forget the name.

233
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:03,430
Speaker 1: Yeah that game.

234
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,173
Speaker 1: I remember that game.

235
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:04,996
Speaker 1: That game was pretty good.

236
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:05,317
Speaker 0: Yeah.

237
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:06,220
Speaker 0: It was a good game.

238
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:09,828
Speaker 1: I'll come back to zenk icon next year.

239
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,438
Speaker 0: Oh I remember watching that hearthstone tournament.

240
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:19,712
Speaker 1: Also Apparently now that Pacs has negotiated to be in the Philly Convention Center I learned from a couple people because I didn't know a lot about that convention center.

241
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:20,254
Speaker 0: You went there.

242
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:21,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't know a lot about it.

243
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:30,940
Speaker 1: Like I know a lot about the BCEC and the BCC and the Hines just cuz like, you know For various research I never knew shit about the Philly Convention Center.

244
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,239
Speaker 1: But apparently the reason building you've been in yeah, but I why would I have studied it?

245
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:36,026
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

246
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:37,157
Speaker 1: You wanna run a convention there?

247
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:37,339
Speaker 0: No.

248
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:42,374
Speaker 1: So apparently the reason no one ran conventions there was that the unions would basically just say no.

249
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:48,220
Speaker 1: like that that convention center was notorious For having the worst possible union interactions you could have.

250
00:15:48,722 --> 00:16:00,040
Speaker 1: Apparently you had to negotiate with five separate unions who all had Required hours and overtime and everything to do anything in that convention center, and that's why nothing is really there.

251
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:24,240
Speaker 1: so apparently they consolidated that and now you only have to negotiate with one union and Some people have implied to me that it might have been because Pacs sort of like came in with money and said listen guys it's not really clear what happened, but Might maybe some guy could move into that convention center Being downtown grow because they were already outgrowing the shockingly big Convention Center in Lancaster.

252
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:28,140
Speaker 1: Like since you've been a few years I make it bigger.

253
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:32,360
Speaker 0: It is it is way big just a Marriott Hotel when I was there.

254
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,274
Speaker 1: No, it's in a full-on convention center like a pretty big one.

255
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:40,760
Speaker 1: Oh when I was there I mean it's connected to the Marriott the Marriott, but it has a whole bunch of big spaces.

256
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,006
Speaker 1: It's just completely full.

257
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:45,467
Speaker 1: every hotel in the whole city was full and in fact That's not a lot of hotel.

258
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:53,060
Speaker 1: when we got to our days in There was a line of people waiting to check in and they were all having drama and trouble.

259
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,179
Speaker 0: I'm blazing at the daisies.

260
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:58,615
Speaker 1: It looks like most of them were at the wrong days in because they were kids.

261
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:12,260
Speaker 1: they didn't know how to make hotel reservations And the rest of them were trying to get a hotel in town because they drove to town Not just expecting they could get a hotel room and literally every hotel in the entire city was sold out and they were getting desperate.

262
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:15,608
Speaker 1: So later that night our hotel put up a no vacanee sign.

263
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:16,330
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

264
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:17,253
Speaker 1: It was spelled wrong.

265
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,396
Speaker 1: So no vacanee.

266
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,890
Speaker 1: Yeah That hotel was the third worst hotel.

267
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,377
Speaker 1: I've ever slept at in my life, by the way Do not ever is worse than the Chai live motor in.

268
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:27,843
Speaker 1: no Is the third word.

269
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:34,440
Speaker 1: the Chai motor in is the second worst and the family and I stayed at like 80 miles outside of Gatlinburg.

270
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:38,168
Speaker 1: Tennessee is probably the worst Child.

271
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:40,045
Speaker 0: that motor in The family in the door did not lock the child.

272
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,540
Speaker 1: I might be the worst as we pushed a couch up to the door to lock the door.

273
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:53,800
Speaker 0: You can always go stay in one of the like nightmare cockroach bedbug places in Times Square area for one night.

274
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:55,869
Speaker 0: You just walk over and stay there.

275
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:59,002
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's only like a hundred bucks a night - yeah There was.

276
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:03,635
Speaker 1: so you want to read what might be the whitest article anyone's ever written on the internet.

277
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:14,457
Speaker 1: this like white tech bro Dude blogger wrote a whole article about his adventure booking a room in that hotel and spending the night and how horrifying it was.

278
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:17,525
Speaker 1: and it is just the Dumbest article you will ever read.

279
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:20,232

Speaker 1: So Happy eight-hour days workers rights and such.

283
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:31,235
Speaker 1: but Amazon you also have Labor Day.

284
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:35,146
Speaker 0: why we need two days Day is fucking five days a week.

285
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:37,954
Speaker 1: May day covers a lot of things though.

286
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:42,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's the first Early May.

289
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,159
Speaker 1: Gatlinburg family in has some a-plus meth.

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,146
Speaker 1: You get enough people in that chat.

291
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:59,540
Speaker 1: so anyway in actual tech news, we wasted like 20 minutes talking about this.

292
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:09,979
Speaker 1: Amazon announced a service that's actually pretty Important I think to the ecosystem of the internet because it's hard to do this if you don't pay someone to do it for you.

293
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:21,300
Speaker 1: but basically Amazon launched something called a self-service marketplace for subscription providers and it's basically Subscribe with anima at Amazon.

294
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:37,255
Speaker 1: so if you sell a thing that is a technology subscription like Adobe Creative Cloud would be an example or Access to a website that does a thing or an app or a game or anything like that Then you can sell that just in Amazon store, right?

295
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:38,460
Speaker 1: They'll just handle it for you.

296
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,385
Speaker 0: This is a thing where anyone there's.

297
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:48,920
Speaker 0: a lot of people have this business model now of subscription selling right subscribe to Netflix Subscribe to a box of stuff that comes in the mail every month.

298
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,192
Speaker 0: Right a lot of people are using the subscribe business model But everyone who does it has to implement it on.

299
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:57,760
Speaker 0: that's like code the same code over and over again.

300
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,471
Speaker 0: So it's like that's if you want to do a subscription thing You have to write this code that everyone's already written.

301
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,320
Speaker 0: There's no way you there's no service.

302
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,545
Speaker 0: It just like offers it to.

303
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:09,260
Speaker 1: you know, all the code really has to do now is interface with payment processors.

304
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:17,699
Speaker 1: yeah, take customer info and Somehow provide an authentication token of some kind to the actual service.

305
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:22,432
Speaker 0: Yep So now Amazon made a thing so you don't have to write this code anymore You can just use their thing

306
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:30,140
Speaker 1: and more importantly It means that your thing is just in Amazon's marketplace Like if there wasn't patreon and geek nights was for money, which don't worry that will never happen.

307
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:46,497
Speaker 1: You could literally we could be like by geek nights for a dollar a month on Amazon And like I was looking at the docks now it works and I think this is going to Actually hurt some of the services like patreon that many people are using to do this kind of thing.

308
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:48,744
Speaker 0: if those It's not it's.

309
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:51,400
Speaker 0: yeah, it's not accessible to pay trans for individual.

310
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:52,564
Speaker 1: Yeah This is this is.

311
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:58,161
Speaker 1: this is well in terms of what you need to be able to bring to the table You have to be a step up in that You're.

312
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:12,933
Speaker 1: you probably need to be a company and more importantly you need to have the development Expertise to be able to use the service because it's gonna let you set up that Authentication token like you still need to make that all happen Easier than developing.

313
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:23,862
Speaker 1: Yeah So I think there will be a you know would be a good place for this Certain video games that are on patreon right now to give you access to the video game Like.

314
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:24,424
Speaker 1: that is the.

315
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:25,688
Speaker 1: that is the use case here.

316
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:31,125
Speaker 1: the question what I don't know is how much of a big Amazon's taking Compared to other services.

317
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,791
Speaker 1: I didn't dig into that much detail.

318
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:33,494
Speaker 0: They always take.

319
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:36,655
Speaker 1: yeah, of course they take but Take and take and take.

320
00:21:37,784 --> 00:21:38,769
Speaker 1: pay attention to this

321
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:39,453
Speaker 0: rent seeking

322
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:58,054
Speaker 1: because if This ecosystem I suspect is going to be the primary subscription ecosystem in a relatively short amount of time Because the reality is people trust Amazon and even though there are other e-commerce platforms Lay people do not trust them because they aren't Amazon and that's just the way.

323
00:21:58,094 --> 00:22:01,739
Speaker 1: it is real hard to compete with Amazon Like seamless in Grubhub.

324
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:08,040
Speaker 1: There's a reason it's so hard to compete with them because even though they don't offer the best services They already exist and people have heard of them.

325
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:12,247
Speaker 1: Anyway and some other tech news.

326
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:16,120
Speaker 1: that's actually a big deal and is gonna be a bigger deal later.

327
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,757
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna talk about in too much depth, but tinder that website to get your fucking on.

328
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:22,647
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm not even a website.

329
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:23,634
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure is just an app.

330
00:22:23,695 --> 00:22:24,360
Speaker 1: Is it just an app?

331
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,951
Speaker 0: I don't think you can swipe on the web.

332
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:26,898
Speaker 0: I think you can only swipe.

333
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:30,879
Speaker 1: well I saw someone made an app that will auto swipe through their API.

334
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:38,264
Speaker 1: Alright, so but essentially another company Used some sort of.

335
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:43,499
Speaker 1: they use their API to get all the photos that people have uploaded into tinder.

336
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,077
Speaker 1: But you can just pull out of the API.

337
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,020
Speaker 1: I mean stuff's just public essentially and they used it to make a data set for facial recognition.

338
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean someone put out free photos that are all squares.

339
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:54,978
Speaker 0: They're all.

340
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,667
Speaker 0: you know, it's Thanks, you can read the.

341
00:22:57,787 --> 00:22:59,073
Speaker 0: I know they're all people's faces.

342
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:01,363
Speaker 0: cuz I don't want to go in too much depth It's on one hand.

343
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:09,490
Speaker 1: on your own data sets are one of the like like the last frontiers of Monetizing and late capitalism in terms of technology.

344
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:21,487
Speaker 1: right now like on Wall Street pretty much everywhere Selling data or being a platform are like the places you can still make money without having to do something Like that no one's ever done before.

345
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:38,240
Speaker 1: like there's a lot of money in making data sets using data sets and a data set like this for like generating machine learning algorithms or doing anything with facial recognition super super super valuable and useful and Arguably violates the terms of service of the website.

346
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:44,759
Speaker 1: The data was gotten from yeah And the whole cat of worms that gets opened is say there's a website that has information on it.

347
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,195
Speaker 1: Copyright means I can't take that information and just redistribute it without a license.

348
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:50,219
Speaker 1: That's already covered.

349
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:54,100
Speaker 1: But what if I take that information and use it myself?

350
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,489
Speaker 1: But don't provide that information to other people.

351
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:59,300
Speaker 1: I just provide information I generated from that information.

352
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,794
Speaker 0: I mean the only reason we know they scrape tinder is because someone said so.

353
00:24:02,814 --> 00:24:06,239
Speaker 0: if they're just kept their mouth shut it would just Been like hey, we have a facial recognition thing.

354
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:08,438
Speaker 0: No one would have known where the hell they got it from.

355
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:10,499
Speaker 0: It's only because they open their big fat mouth.

356
00:24:10,902 --> 00:24:17,294
Speaker 0: And this is the same thing I say to a lot of other people is like a lot of you will make stuff and they upload It to YouTube and it gets taken down or like yep people.

357
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:22,074
Speaker 1: the dude who made it steward Kolyani released it under a public domain creative right.

358
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:23,519
Speaker 0: a lot of people will like make.

359
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:25,930
Speaker 0: it was like a 3d chrono trigger.

360
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:31,436
Speaker 0: people are making some other who making a Super Metro a Metroid 2 remake and these things get taken down.

361
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:44,891
Speaker 0: and it's like assholes When you make something and you're gonna put it out there And there's something about it that is gonna stop it somehow because you got your data from somewhere shady Yeah, or you're violating some copyright something while you're generating buzz.

362
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:45,433
Speaker 1: call it.

363
00:24:45,894 --> 00:24:47,840
Speaker 1: call it Trono Bringer or something.

364
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:50,059
Speaker 0: Don't take any fucking credit for it.

365
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:59,699
Speaker 0: So no one knows who the hell you are and just put it up on BitTorrent completely anonymously And don't say where it came from and no one will be able to fucking stop you.

366
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,288
Speaker 0: I scraped tinder to make some database.

367
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:07,027
Speaker 0: I would just put it anonymously on to BitTorrent like tada Mysteriously.

368
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,640
Speaker 0: this database appeared out of nowhere.

369
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,850
Speaker 0: I don't know where it came from and now everyone has it.

370
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:14,038
Speaker 0: if you do it where you tell everyone now There's gonna be a big ruckus.

371
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:15,447
Speaker 1: But it's not only that this.

372
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:28,674
Speaker 1: the reason this could like I don't want to talk about this too much Is that there are so many interesting issues you could talk about based on this one story like for example right now I'm looking at information in a web browser because that information is publicly available on the internet.

373
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:37,990
Speaker 1: if a website has terms of service For use but does not have accounts and does not block people from accessing it Are you actually bound to those terms of service?

374
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,519
Speaker 0: especially does have accounts though, but say you don't.

375
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:51,720
Speaker 1: Especially if you hit a website with a browser Meaning, you know some sort of scraper curl that doesn't actually read the footer of the page that says it has terms of service.

376
00:25:52,225 --> 00:26:01,522
Speaker 1: You'd never even encountered them If I trespass on some land and I didn't actually pass any no trespassing signs at any point because they didn't put them on That side of the property though.

377
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:15,019
Speaker 1: all those questions are largely unanswerable even my lawyers right now and they've been unanswerable for a long time and Based on the way Congress is going I suspect no laws will be passed in the next 10 or 20 years to deal with this stuff.

378
00:26:15,814 --> 00:26:22,220
Speaker 1: so The upside is if you use tinder your photo is part of this public domain data set of people.

379
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:37,940
Speaker 0: I mean we always say this anyway anything that you upload to the internet Anything that you put on a device any data you put on any sort of electronic thing that is connected to the internet Even if you check private only share with my friends direct message only.

380
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:39,365
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

381
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:45,365
Speaker 0: you have effectively, you know shared that thing with the entire Human race.

382
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:52,107
Speaker 1: let's put it simply there are no sharing controls Except client-side encryption.

383
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:55,055
Speaker 1: That is the only way you can control data you send.

384
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:57,748
Speaker 0: and even then if I send something to rimming I know you don't.

385
00:26:57,768 --> 00:26:58,519
Speaker 1: you can't trust me.

386
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,955
Speaker 0: I have to trust rim not to share it with the entire world on purpose or by accident.

387
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:07,251
Speaker 0: You know now that image is unencrypted on rims phone.

388
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,480
Speaker 0: who knows where it's gonna go next, right?

389
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:20,536
Speaker 0: Oh, the only way if I take say a photo and I want it to be absolutely private I must a keep it in my house only on non internet connected mediums, and that is it.

390
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:25,728
Speaker 1: and the last news Surprisingly multiple people I guess goble goble.

391
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:28,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone knows that I used to spend a lot of time in Turkey.

392
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:33,396
Speaker 1: So Because that's not a super common thing to do I guess so a lot of.

393
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,199
Speaker 0: I don't think it's the.

394
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:45,700
Speaker 1: oh Even before it was not the most visited country three different people messaged me to tell me about this or you know As it happened ad zenk icon two different people when I ran into them because I didn't see in a while.

395
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,171
Speaker 1: They're like, oh, yeah, you hear about Turkey and I was like, it's good I heard about it a lot of things are going on with Turkey.

396
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:53,260
Speaker 1: one thing in particular like oh how they blocked Wikipedia.

397
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:55,131
Speaker 1: So yes to all of you out there.

398
00:27:55,251 --> 00:28:01,859
Speaker 1: I'm aware that this happened and the irony I mean the fact that Wikipedia is blocked in Turkey.

399
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:06,060
Speaker 1: I. Well, I don't want to say it's not news because it is news and it's a bad thing.

400
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:10,920
Speaker 1: But it is probably the least bad news that has come out of Turkey in the last several weeks.

401
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:14,314
Speaker 0: It's a bad news, but of the bad news is it is the least one.

402
00:28:14,354 --> 00:28:23,435
Speaker 1: I mean if you're not familiar Turkey basically voted in a scam election to Make er to on effectively the Chancellor of Germany.

403
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:25,686
Speaker 0: Oh Is that how you pronounce his name?

404
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:27,355
Speaker 0: I thought it was edrogan.

405
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:33,877
Speaker 1: It's Turkish is interesting in that if the letters like pronunciation and conjugation are 100% regular.

406
00:28:35,502 --> 00:28:39,338
Speaker 1: See now you look at when you learn like Spanish or French like they teach you rules for conjugation.

407
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:45,695
Speaker 0: I thought My pronunciation was way more Marduk guard a calm than yours was.

408
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:47,660
Speaker 1: Yeah the way that now I'm disappointed.

409
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,673
Speaker 0: Hey, he's like, I mean he's already not cool.

410
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:50,700
Speaker 0: But now he's even less cool.

411
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:52,291
Speaker 0: So you want to learn how to be evil.

412
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:53,620
Speaker 0: at least be cool evil.

413
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:55,019
Speaker 1: Here's how you pronounce Turkish words.

414
00:28:55,303 --> 00:29:04,447
Speaker 1: You look up a few rules But basically learn how to pronounce all the vowels and look up the list of consonants that are pronounced and any Consonant that's not on that list.

415
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:10,979
Speaker 1: Just kind of swallow it as you say the word So like yeah to him just kind of like swallow the end and you'll sound close enough.

416
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:25,742
Speaker 0: Anyway, so anyway, so funniest thing is that they blocked Wikipedia and perhaps one of the reasons they blocked Wikipedia Is there pages like this which are 2017 block of Wikipedia in Turkey is literally on Wikipedia.

417
00:29:25,782 --> 00:29:29,496
Speaker 0: there's a Wikipedia page about it Wikipedia being blocked in Turkey.

418
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:33,773
Speaker 0: and I was saying like hey You know, I guess it's not as bad as the Great Firewall of China.

419
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:35,640
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they don't allow Wikipedia either.

420
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:37,109
Speaker 1: Well, they're making their own Wikipedia.

421
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:37,431
Speaker 1: Sure.

422
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:38,759
Speaker 0: That's gonna work out great for them.

423
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:46,400
Speaker 0: But like if I don't have Wikipedia, that's like I could survive but that's pretty close to not having water.

424
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:48,934
Speaker 0: It's real bad without Wikipedia.

425
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:50,040
Speaker 0: Like I don't know anything.

426
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,911
Speaker 1: So yeah with what do I know if I have the internet and Wikipedia?

427
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,198
Speaker 1: I can know basic stuff about everything.

428
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,345
Speaker 1: if I have the Internet but not Wikipedia.

429
00:29:58,686 --> 00:30:01,696
Speaker 1: How is baby formed is the best you're gonna get about most topics.

430
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,820
Speaker 0: What the fuck - I don't know shit.

431
00:30:03,222 --> 00:30:04,025
Speaker 1: Like we really are.

432
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:05,491
Speaker 1: we're like, why don't we do a show about crabs?

433
00:30:05,812 --> 00:30:10,347
Speaker 1: and I realized that without Wikipedia I don't know fucking anything about crabs.

434
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:16,800
Speaker 0: and I my first my first thought was actually a stupid thought which is oh go to the Library and get like a tiny book about crabs.

435
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,060
Speaker 0: That's like one of those, you know ones meant for kids or something.

436
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,520
Speaker 0: But like, you know the kind you would do a book report with so you'd actually get more information about crabs.

437
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,605
Speaker 1: That's what you'd have to do.

438
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:25,891
Speaker 0: But then I was like, wait a minute.

439
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:28,000
Speaker 0: I can just read the Wikipedia page about crabs.

440
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,553
Speaker 0: No everything there is no yeah without Wikipedia.

441
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:34,320
Speaker 1: I don't know stuff anymore.

442
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:39,520
Speaker 0: I see, you know used to be the every year during the holiday times Wikipedia post that thing on all the pages.

443
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,371
Speaker 0: Like give us money.

444
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,988
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh I give the money now and I guess about.

445
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:46,100
Speaker 0: I guess enough people give the money to keep them alive because they're still there.

446
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:48,676
Speaker 0: I switched to give it the monthly monies.

447
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,387
Speaker 0: Oh Obviously less monthly money, right?

448
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:55,440
Speaker 0: But maybe you're paying for the whole thing maybe but it's like, you know that way.

449
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:56,003
Speaker 0: It's like.

450
00:30:56,043 --> 00:31:00,646
Speaker 0: I don't have to remember to do it, you know at the end of the year Like did I do it already this year?

451
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:01,148
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

452
00:31:01,168 --> 00:31:02,232
Speaker 0: It's nope monthly monies.

453
00:31:02,252 --> 00:31:03,857
Speaker 0: It's either Wikipedia going.

454
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:04,620
Speaker 1: it's just interesting.

455
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,566
Speaker 1: I'm curious out there.

456
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:07,839
Speaker 1: This is like a food for thought for you guys out there the listener.

457
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:15,080
Speaker 1: How often do you actually go to Wikipedia and do you think about using a percentage of your Google searches result with success on?

458
00:31:15,464 --> 00:31:16,318
Speaker 0: Wikipedia page.

459
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:18,306
Speaker 0: Yeah and that's where you got what you want.

460
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:31,840
Speaker 1: because the way my life goes is any time I'm in any Conversation and someone brings something up and I don't know enough about that thing to engage with them that day I just read the Wikipedia page about whatever that thing is.

461
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:43,400
Speaker 0: I think about half of my Google searches are wiki space something so that I know that I'm gonna basically saying give me the Wikipedia page for this Google because the next answer is gonna be some Yahoo answers bullshit.

462
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:45,637
Speaker 1: And then after that, it's down into Urban Dictionary.

463
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:48,630
Speaker 0: Yep Sometimes Urban Dictionary is what you want.

464
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:50,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, like what the hell does this mean?

465
00:31:56,571 --> 00:32:01,645
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day I just stumbled upon this YouTube show randomly.

466
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:08,644
Speaker 1: it's old it's from like 2007 and I can't believe I haven't found this like.

467
00:32:08,664 --> 00:32:12,159
Speaker 1: I never ran into this before Because it's just it's up my alley.

468
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,030
Speaker 0: in a lot of ways this matches up with one of our things.

469
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,370
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, sometimes you have a thing with your group of people like an inside joke.

470
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:24,250
Speaker 0: Oh, you know some story that's told off in or you know, like a like, you know, the certain things.

471
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:27,275
Speaker 0: There's things you have, you know I don't know what to call them but like.

472
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:37,350
Speaker 0: and then you discover another separate group of people local me Right and they have the same or similar thing to what you have and somehow you had this connection with these other people.

473
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:41,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't even know like you both make the same kind of joke about a specific kind of board game.

474
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:47,730
Speaker 1: So, uh, this is a show you can watch called cautionary tales of swords.

475
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,679
Speaker 1: This is episode one.

476
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:56,590
Speaker 1: quote in this episode, honey I killed our son and swords will cut your fucking hands off.

477
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,172
Speaker 0: that's true.

478
00:32:57,533 --> 00:33:08,102
Speaker 1: all the show is is a dude with an eyepatch answering viewer mail about swords and Cautionary skits explaining why don't ever own swords?

479
00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:09,325
Speaker 1: swords are stupid.

480
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:10,790
Speaker 1: They will fucking cut you.

481
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:12,535
Speaker 1: Never own swords.

482
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:17,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there are many episodes when you're in the kitchen with a knife like you're cautious like you.

483
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:18,377
Speaker 0: This is dangerous.

484
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:20,710
Speaker 0: I must respect this blade and not cut myself.

485
00:33:21,612 --> 00:33:29,214
Speaker 0: Like people don't hold swords that often and even nerds the olds who hold swords more often than normal people But still not that often.

486
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:34,148
Speaker 0: a sword is a fucking giant ass knife, especially like a Japanese one.

487
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,430
Speaker 0: Holy shit It is so dangerous.

488
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:39,030
Speaker 0: Don't fuck around with them.

489
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:49,110
Speaker 0: But most of the time when we're talking about swords is I'm with the dangers of spending all your money on them Yeah, which if I had money when I would say in high school or middle school, I would have spent it on too many swords.

490
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:50,918
Speaker 0: Oh, thankfully I did not do that.

491
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,510
Speaker 0: We you know, this is this is our sword thing, right?

492
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,010
Speaker 0: It's like we have this sort like don't buy swords thing and this other group of people make these YouTube videos.

493
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,741
Speaker 0: They have their don't buy swords thing.

494
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,170
Speaker 0: So we have a connection with them.

495
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,679
Speaker 1: Don't don't not buy swords.

496
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,105
Speaker 1: So they will cut you.

497
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:11,730
Speaker 0: so, you know You know the old trick where like you make it look like you took your thumb off right like this.

498
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:13,358
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'm not even doing it that well.

499
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:14,524
Speaker 0: I'm doing trick.

500
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:15,770
Speaker 0: How well am I doing it poorly?

501
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:19,077
Speaker 1: I can see your thumb bent backwards.

502
00:34:19,097 --> 00:34:19,639
Speaker 0: I'm bad at it.

503
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:19,860
Speaker 0: Right?

504
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,949
Speaker 1: Anyway, I can't even see myself in the video, right?

505
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:28,090
Speaker 0: the point is You know, it's an old trick, you know when no one gets fooled by that right unless you're like a little kid.

506
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:35,230
Speaker 0: But this guy on YouTube, I don't even know you could push this trick to such limits.

507
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:39,350
Speaker 0: I don't even I have to go frame by frame to see how he even does the last part.

508
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,344
Speaker 0: I mean I got an idea but it's like I watch it once.

509
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:44,935
Speaker 1: he just moves real quick He pushes this trick.

510
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:49,090
Speaker 0: He has practiced this way too much and it's like god damn.

511
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:58,561
Speaker 0: I would not be surprised if he legit had like either crazy fingers that like flex and in improbable ways or Literally actual fake fingers.

512
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:00,190
Speaker 0: that is hyper realistic or something.

513
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:05,990
Speaker 1: I mean as a kid I got a magic set like one of those box magic sets kids get and it came with a fake thumb and a fake finger.

514
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, mine also came with this pink rubbery finger.

515
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,890
Speaker 0: It's obviously fake and you know magic with it.

516
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:12,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

517
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:15,910
Speaker 1: I used it for I covered blood and throw it at people instead of using it a magic trick.

518
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,384
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a Halloween decoration a magic trick I did with it.

519
00:35:19,404 --> 00:35:20,970
Speaker 1: That's kind of relevant to my thing of the day.

520
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:30,745
Speaker 1: it was a magic trick that I just used to scare my grandparents where I'd use that finger and I act like I'm doing this complicated knife trick and then I Accidentally cut my thumb off and have blood spray everywhere.

521
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:33,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a. That's how they do.

522
00:35:34,772 --> 00:35:40,849
Speaker 1: But this is only 16 seconds long and you might think like how far can they push this trick in 16 seconds?

523
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:41,667
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

524
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:42,515
Speaker 0: I think you could.

525
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:49,790
Speaker 0: the the 16 seconds you spent Listening to us is way more wasted than the 16 seconds you can spend watching this video number 5 on trending.

526
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,597
Speaker 1: Is this trending or something right now?

527
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:53,825
Speaker 1: Oh, I think people are seeing this.

528
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:54,307
Speaker 1: Maybe that's how.

529
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:55,150
Speaker 1: how did you find this?

530
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:55,752
Speaker 0: I don't know.

531
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:56,515
Speaker 1: You don't know.

532
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:57,198
Speaker 1: it just came in.

533
00:35:57,218 --> 00:35:59,910
Speaker 0: I just I read a lot of internet every day.

534
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:01,536
Speaker 0: You know how much internet I read.

535
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:12,498
Speaker 1: there was just a study that was released today saying that the average white-collar worker in the United States consumes 12 hours of Content per day on average.

536
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:15,430
Speaker 0: I don't think I do that much because I'm only at work for eight hours.

537
00:36:17,754 --> 00:36:18,930
Speaker 0: So that would not be possible.

538
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:29,153
Speaker 0: You got to subtract the time I'm working sleeping and eating also at eight hours and then when I'm at home definitely not four hours Unless you can't.

539
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:32,745
Speaker 0: I mean, you know playing games doesn't count as internet content.

540
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:34,090
Speaker 1: It counts as consuming media.

541
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,721
Speaker 0: I think yeah, but I mean it depends what you count.

542
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,027
Speaker 0: right if I'm reading comics in bed.

543
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:38,589
Speaker 0: Does that count?

544
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,012
Speaker 1: Let's see.

545
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:41,457
Speaker 1: Thanks to multitasking.

546
00:36:41,538 --> 00:36:44,950
Speaker 1: Oh, so people, you know people might have two media streams on at the same time.

547
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:46,000
Speaker 0: I don't do that.

548
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:46,970
Speaker 0: I don't do that either.

549
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,863
Speaker 1: I do that occasionally, but only when the task I'm doing is rote.

550
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:52,890
Speaker 0: I'm only doing one one at a time.

551
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:57,346
Speaker 0: Oh wait, does it count if I have music playing while reading a web page?

552
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:58,470
Speaker 1: I don't know.

553
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:00,436
Speaker 1: I did not read the article.

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,654
Speaker 1: I'm doing two things.

565
00:37:30,694 --> 00:37:31,337

Speaker 1: I'm hunting line out and I am forming an entirely new town.

569
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got to figure out the town thing.

570
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,550
Speaker 1: I heard rumors about that but like someone key toad hinted at me the the start of that whole saga.

571
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:46,859
Speaker 0: I don't even know where the start is.

572
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,269
Speaker 1: So remember I said you can buy a house.

573
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:54,550
Speaker 1: Yeah If you buy that house The builders dealing with that house are free to go off and do their show.

574
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:57,123
Speaker 0: I didn't buy the house cuz I'm saving my money for other stuff first.

575
00:37:57,365 --> 00:38:00,016
Speaker 1: I got like I'm gonna 9,000 rupees.

576
00:38:00,076 --> 00:38:04,010
Speaker 0: so I spend my munt rupees upgrading some stuff but buying some armors.

577
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,655
Speaker 0: But I'm going to.

578
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:07,080
Speaker 0: next thing has been a rupees on.

579
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,548
Speaker 0: is I found a fairy who upgrades horses.

580
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:10,210
Speaker 1: What?

581
00:38:10,772 --> 00:38:12,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, why is a fairy fountain?

582
00:38:12,798 --> 00:38:15,828
Speaker 0: that's a 3,000 rupee fairy fountain that I have not opened yet.

583
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:17,614
Speaker 0: what For horses?

584
00:38:17,635 --> 00:38:19,140
Speaker 0: the horse fairy fountain.

585
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,110
Speaker 0: I got all four regular fairy fountains, but there's a horse fairy.

586
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,416
Speaker 1: I've only got two fairy fountains.

587
00:38:23,497 --> 00:38:24,320
Speaker 1: actually just I got.

588
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:26,370
Speaker 0: I know you can't upgrade your armors to the fourth level.

589
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,434
Speaker 0: No, I can't I?

590
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:30,206
Speaker 0: for fairy fountains and the fourth one cost 10,000 rupees.

591
00:38:32,052 --> 00:38:34,967
Speaker 0: But I got the horse fairy fountain, but I need the 3,000 rupees to open it.

592
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,261
Speaker 1: I'm way more excited about the horse fairy than I am about the.

593
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:40,490
Speaker 1: is it actually a giant like sexy horse?

594
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:40,811
Speaker 1: It comes.

595
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:43,562
Speaker 0: I haven't opened it because I need 3,000 rupees.

596
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:47,339
Speaker 1: if that fairy does not have a horse head I'm gonna be legit disappointed.

597
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,369
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's gotta have a horse head.

598
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:51,995
Speaker 1: Otherwise we were.

599
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:53,262
Speaker 1: I was just at Zenkai Con.

600
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:54,248
Speaker 1: we did three panels super fun.

601
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:56,479
Speaker 1: I guess the next con will be out.

602
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,026
Speaker 1: is Kinetic Con exciting?

603
00:38:58,227 --> 00:39:02,400
Speaker 1: and then Pax Unplugged and then Pax West and then Pax Australia.

604
00:39:02,421 --> 00:39:06,714
Speaker 0: I mean if you're listening to this you've already probably found us everywhere On the internet that we are.

605
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:10,930
Speaker 0: but we are on all the places of the internet that exists particularly YouTube.

606
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,536
Speaker 1: We got in that way many.

607
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,954
Speaker 0: we have many youtubes and Twitter's and we even have Facebook And we got.

608
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:18,059
Speaker 0: we have a fucking everything.

609
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,457
Speaker 0: if there's a place on the internet that people post things We have a thing there and we post there.

610
00:39:22,898 --> 00:39:33,164
Speaker 0: so go to all the places that you use on the internet and find us rim and me and geek nights and follow all But then don't actually watch any of the content.

611
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:43,612
Speaker 1: Yeah So in other news meaning the actual main bid we I guess did a show on DRM.

612
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:44,053
Speaker 1: never.

613
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:46,179
Speaker 1: I don't know how that never happened.

614
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:49,568
Speaker 1: I feel like we did it like I almost remember doing it.

615
00:39:50,532 --> 00:39:51,880
Speaker 1: I feel I feel like we've talked about.

616
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:56,439
Speaker 1: I feel like this was the primary thing I was mad about for like eight years of my life.

617
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, and yet somehow we've never talked about it.

618
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,158
Speaker 0: It was a big problem, man.

619
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,710
Speaker 0: It's still a problem, but much smaller one.

620
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,275
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

621
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:10,749
Speaker 0: DRM is digital rights management And what DRM is is you have some data and you want to give that data to somebody else?

622
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:14,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to make it available and so you share it around.

623
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:21,431
Speaker 0: But you only want people to be able to use read that data if they have permissions to do So.

624
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:23,320
Speaker 0: for example, I am Adobe.

625
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,324
Speaker 0: I made Photoshop.

626
00:40:24,384 --> 00:40:25,510
Speaker 0: Photoshop is just data.

627
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:36,540
Speaker 0: It's just an exe file Photoshop that exe and people can just download the fucking thing Right and they if some one person downloads it or gets it on a CD or USB stick They can just give it to someone else.

628
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,910
Speaker 0: It's just data they can copy up.

629
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:45,930
Speaker 0: It's just a giant number, but they do not want people who do not pay for Photoshop to be able to use Photoshop.

630
00:40:46,131 --> 00:40:56,689
Speaker 0: So they put some special code in there to make that Difficult to use the Photoshop if you have not paid for and that is DRM and there are many mechanisms for doing this.

631
00:40:57,192 --> 00:41:01,414
Speaker 0: But the fundamental idea is that you have a thing I could imagine.

632
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:04,710
Speaker 0: you have a treasure chest and the Photoshop is in the treasure chest and it's locked.

633
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:08,630
Speaker 0: So you give out treasure chests with Photoshop inside to everybody.

634
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:12,789
Speaker 0: But only some people got keys to open it.

635
00:41:13,552 --> 00:41:18,870
Speaker 0: The problem is you're also giving people the keys so they can also copy the key.

636
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:21,009
Speaker 1: Oh, like there's the key is also data.

637
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:28,490
Speaker 1: So DVDs and blu-rays right like if you have encryption on the discs so they can only be played in legitimate players.

638
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:35,853
Speaker 0: So the legitimate DVD players have keys in them and the DVDs themselves are locked treasure chest with movies inside But those keys.

639
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:40,450
Speaker 0: and if you put the DVD into an illegitimate DVD player that DVD player does not have the key.

640
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:44,050
Speaker 0: So we can only watch DVDs that are unlocked treasure chest.

641
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:51,662
Speaker 0: It can't watch ones that are locked except if I buy a legit DVD player Once the keys are in there and I can take them out.

642
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:55,458
Speaker 1: They might be complicated keys Yeah, but they're still just keys.

643
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:59,896
Speaker 0: It might be hard to get them out of there, but they're in there and They are.

644
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:03,990
Speaker 1: there's an angry nerd somewhere who will get the key out of there and put it on the internet, right?

645
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,495
Speaker 0: And that's how DRM works.

646
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:12,987
Speaker 0: It's like it's never foolproof because the fundamental concept behind it is just Absolutely flawed from the get-go, right?

647
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:25,970
Speaker 1: The so so arguably, you know when we talk about DRM the kind of DRM that pertains to subscription software Does work more so and also is pretty justifiable.

648
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:31,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't have problems saying it's not justified in all case, but it also the main reason it can work.

649
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:42,064
Speaker 1: Is that unlike most things people talk about with DRM because they're usually talking about Static media like movies or songs when it comes to software.

650
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:43,590
Speaker 1: There's no analog hole.

651
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:47,470
Speaker 1: I can't just take a picture of my screen and now I've got a copy of that.

652
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,230
Speaker 0: Oh, that's only one of the flaws of DRM, right?

653
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:59,489
Speaker 0: the main flaw of DRM is the one we talked about which is that the key is also digital and once someone gets the Key, you're giving people the lock and the key and once they have everything they have everything.

654
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:00,733
Speaker 0: right now It's making it difficult.

655
00:43:01,154 --> 00:43:04,867
Speaker 0: the other flaw of DRM specifically on media such as a movie.

656
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:10,570
Speaker 0: It's like, okay Let's say I never figured out the key to unencrypt this DVD and it only plays my legitimate DVD player.

657
00:43:10,951 --> 00:43:16,070
Speaker 0: It still has to send that video to my television and even if you use they do have DRM.

658
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,318
Speaker 0: It's called HDCP on HDMI cables, and that's new.

659
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:20,220
Speaker 1: it used to not exist.

660
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,050
Speaker 0: So I can't record easily from the HDMI cable itself.

661
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:26,834
Speaker 0: I can't trick right.

662
00:43:27,015 --> 00:43:31,088
Speaker 0: I can still point a camera at my television and record everything.

663
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:36,609
Speaker 0: So Congratulations, in fact my grandfather I can't point a camera at my monitor and record Photoshop.

664
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:44,819
Speaker 1: so my grandfather who is real old was a carpenter and and I'm cabinet maker when he was young too.

665
00:43:44,839 --> 00:44:03,395
Speaker 1: and He in the earliest earliest days when when photocopies existed he immediately would get catalogs of Big enough to just use.

666
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:08,190
Speaker 1: he was pirating that stuff in the like pre-internet days.

667
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,407
Speaker 0: So their DRM was pretty much make it really small so no one can see.

668
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:12,895
Speaker 1: yep It's like by the pattern.

669
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:16,230
Speaker 0: here's a catalog of patterns and it has pictures of the patterns.

670
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no tiny thing.

671
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:21,690
Speaker 0: Why don't you just send them money and they'll send you the pattern, you know at full size.

672
00:44:22,111 --> 00:44:29,790
Speaker 0: But he just take the tiny picture of a pattern make it bigger and now we can see it, but it more technological Even though that not that that wasn't technology.

673
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:33,946
Speaker 1: We had a fancy camcorder like a really fancy one that the family all share.

674
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:34,709
Speaker 0: still took VHS tapes.

675
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:38,483
Speaker 1: It took VHS tapes, but back then full-size ones.

676
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:40,330
Speaker 0: Not the small ones that you put into the full size.

677
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:48,145
Speaker 1: It was not easy to copy VHS tapes that had copy protection because there was copy protection on VHS tapes.

678
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:51,229
Speaker 1: It's this complicated analog thing We've talked about in old episodes of geek nights.

679
00:44:51,371 --> 00:45:01,546
Speaker 0: There's also the little piece of plastic where the VCR VCR will refuse to record onto a VHS tape if that piece of plastic has been punched out.

680
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:07,970
Speaker 0: and that's a good thing because you won't Accidentally overwrite the Aladdin VHS tape you bought with say an episode of the Simpsons.

681
00:45:09,152 --> 00:45:14,530
Speaker 1: But that macro vision copy protection worked only because it was a signal on the tape itself.

682
00:45:14,991 --> 00:45:29,898
Speaker 1: So my grandpa took the big TV and he pointed the camcorder at the TV And he plugged the audio inputs on the camcorder into the speaker outputs of the TV and that is how he pirated shit Mm-hmm, and that was legit like it worked

683
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:33,130
Speaker 0: and then for those days you would not be disappointed with the quality nowadays.

684
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,089
Speaker 0: You'd look at that and be like, oh my god, it's unwatchable.

685
00:45:35,236 --> 00:45:39,024
Speaker 1: Yeah but but with with with static media the analog hole exists.

686
00:45:39,044 --> 00:45:46,049
Speaker 1: no matter what I mean right now like Crunchyroll or anything like that if I want to get a clip for a panel I just fire up OBS and record my screen.

687
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:47,293
Speaker 1: It totally works.

688
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:56,519
Speaker 1: if I need audio I can literally pipe the music that is being played from the thing no matter how copy protect It is through my mixer and then back into audition.

689
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,281
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've.

690
00:45:57,622 --> 00:46:00,230
Speaker 0: they've mostly given up on copy protection for music these days.

691
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:05,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much all that Apple gives you like DRM free, you know, AC files or whatever.

692
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:13,909
Speaker 1: yep video is interesting because they've definitely not given up on it and People care less because streaming services exist now, right?

693
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:19,010
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, you know, they made it Spotify Netflix whatnot.

694
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:23,910
Speaker 0: They've made it to the point where it's easier to not pirate.

695
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:24,693
Speaker 0: That was the only thing.

696
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:28,749
Speaker 0: people were pirating these things because it was hard to get it legit.

697
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:29,980
Speaker 0: now It's like you pay for Netflix.

698
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:40,810
Speaker 0: It's way cheap and You can just watch everything with one button press and it plays immediately Which is even easier than in Napster days where you would type it in press enter and then double click and it would play.

699
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:43,897
Speaker 0: This is even less steps Even less steps.

700
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:53,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, so and even now I pay for music services Even though I used to pirate music to the point that pirating music might have arguably been a distinct hobby unto itself for me.

701
00:46:54,291 --> 00:47:00,590
Speaker 0: Right, but these streaming services are still using DRM Even if you're not paying attention because you're not trying to pirate anything.

702
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:10,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, Netflix does not want you to be able to download their show and keep a copy of it forever Right, and that's they remove things from Netflix sometimes, right?

703
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,472
Speaker 0: If you could just download things forever that were on there that wouldn't work out too Well.

704
00:47:14,673 --> 00:47:17,270
Speaker 0: when they're trying to remove things so you can't watch them anymore.

705
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,033
Speaker 1: Oh a big example.

706
00:47:18,073 --> 00:47:20,141
Speaker 1: example of a problem was until recently you would.

707
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:26,169
Speaker 0: you would be in a situation you paying for Netflix for one Month download fucking everything right and then cancel it.

708
00:47:27,352 --> 00:47:31,063
Speaker 1: Days of red octane when I got the maximum subscription plan.

709
00:47:31,465 --> 00:47:38,747
Speaker 1: I rented every single Ps1 game I ever wanted in my life and ran them through the Plex tour as fast as I could.

710
00:47:39,028 --> 00:47:43,575
Speaker 0: in high school There was a. it was a gang not a legit gang But you know a gang of kids.

711
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:48,370
Speaker 0: and what they would do is they would go to Blockbuster and rent PlayStation one games.

712
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:55,390
Speaker 0: Everyone would copy them right and so it's cost you like five bucks each, but there were like ten people.

713
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,009
Speaker 1: Ah, but there was a second component to that.

714
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,989
Speaker 1: Everyone's PlayStation had to have a DRM crack in the form of a mod.

715
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:02,083
Speaker 0: Everyone had that.

716
00:48:02,144 --> 00:48:03,032
Speaker 0: so yeah You would.

717
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:07,610
Speaker 0: basically everyone would go to Blockbuster with five bucks and that would be like ten people.

718
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:10,649
Speaker 0: But you basically getting ten PlayStation games for five dollars.

719
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:18,432
Speaker 0: Right you copied them all and then you returned them all and then you could do it again and get 20 PlayStation games for ten Dollars.

720
00:48:18,794 --> 00:48:27,179
Speaker 0: it just like the math was so great on that for the price of one Blockbuster rental You got the number of friends you had Times number of PlayStation games.

721
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,049
Speaker 0: because you would everyone would make one copy of theirs.

722
00:48:30,752 --> 00:48:32,457
Speaker 0: So thinking I mean all bunch times everybody.

723
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:35,967
Speaker 0: think about how old plus the price of blank CDs.

724
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:41,310
Speaker 1: think about how old-style Piracy wasn't that much of an economic impact because of the physical reality of it.

725
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:47,230
Speaker 1: You know it wasn't as easy and widespread for mass copying and what you guys did was also pretty small scale.

726
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:51,722
Speaker 1: But when I was doing it with red octane there was an economy of scale.

727
00:48:51,923 --> 00:49:02,026
Speaker 1: I could get someone to mail me all Those CDs as fast as I could copy them right because copy in a PlayStation game back Then like you had to burn that shit at 1x.

728
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:04,455
Speaker 1: There's a lot of reasons.

729
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:05,238
Speaker 1: they took a while.

730
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,796
Speaker 0: in the olden days right when technology wasn't as powerful They had other kinds of DRM.

731
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:12,890
Speaker 0: for example you bought a say an old video game like star control, right?

732
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,697
Speaker 0: Oh, and you would install.

733
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:19,229
Speaker 0: you could you could copy this game on floppy disks and give it to all your friends And everyone had to copy a star control.

734
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,981
Speaker 0: But when you open up star control you type star con dot exe.

735
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:28,782
Speaker 0: it would open up and it would be like hello What is the star located?

736
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,610
Speaker 0: and you had this physical star chart?

737
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,803
Speaker 0: It was like a spinny cardboard on a thing and you're just.

738
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:39,973
Speaker 0: it came in the box with the game And you just spin it around and mess with the star chart and answer the question It was giving you.

739
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:46,039
Speaker 0: sometimes they'd ask questions like yeah on page whatever of the rule book What is the tenth word on what?

740
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:49,150
Speaker 1: and it's like quest for glory to did a really clever one?

741
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,018
Speaker 0: There was so many like what are you gonna do?

742
00:49:51,078 --> 00:49:53,510
Speaker 0: photocopy the whole goddamn rule book and give it to every?

743
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,597
Speaker 1: And it's like pain in the ass.

744
00:49:55,637 --> 00:49:56,239
Speaker 1: think about this.

745
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,182
Speaker 1: that was an error.

746
00:49:57,282 --> 00:50:01,435
Speaker 0: make your own star chart somehow perfectly Just like the one that came in the box.

747
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:08,638
Speaker 1: That was an era when floppy disks and computers were widely available But copy machines were not.

748
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:10,384
Speaker 0: it was much harder to come on.

749
00:50:10,404 --> 00:50:11,307
Speaker 1: machines are like that.

750
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:15,864
Speaker 0: stuffs by since Rule books that came with PC games were large.

751
00:50:15,884 --> 00:50:17,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're full books.

752
00:50:17,572 --> 00:50:22,949
Speaker 1: And if you end in those days if you wanted to make photocopies It's not like now where you could just go to a photocopy machine to just do it.

753
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:27,351
Speaker 1: You'd go to like a cake goes and hand them the thing and say here's the copies I want.

754
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:28,420
Speaker 0: they weren't gonna do that.

755
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,730
Speaker 1: They would run the machine for you.

756
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went in there a lot of times with D&D books, and they were like nope fuck you.

757
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:36,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, not helping you pirate that D&D book.

758
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:37,964
Speaker 1: I know exactly what you're doing.

759
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,510
Speaker 0: I'll copy the character sheet for you.

760
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:44,929
Speaker 1: They would not actually copy the character sheet really even though it had a disclaimer on it saying you can copy this.

761
00:50:45,914 --> 00:50:46,949
Speaker 1: That was a long time ago.

762
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:50,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, obviously quest for glory to download a PDF pushprint.

763
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,481
Speaker 0: It was this giant folder that you have.

764
00:50:52,562 --> 00:50:53,790
Speaker 0: use it on your tablet don't even print.

765
00:50:54,251 --> 00:51:00,010
Speaker 1: It was a giant fold-out map of the main town and all the streets and the town is just super complicated.

766
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:06,490
Speaker 1: And if you did not have a physical copy of that map in color the game worked fine and nothing changed.

767
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:12,970
Speaker 1: It never asked you for anything, but good luck ever fucking finding anything or ever getting anywhere in that maze.

768
00:51:13,512 --> 00:51:16,722
Speaker 1: I guess you could figure it out, but it would be.

769
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:22,770
Speaker 1: imagine all three of the Labyrinths in Breath of the Wild and make it about five times bigger than that.

770
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,720
Speaker 1: That's like the size of this stupid.

771
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,689
Speaker 0: You could map it out on your own with a pencil and a paper.

772
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:29,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what I feel like if someone did that.

773
00:51:29,323 --> 00:51:29,926
Speaker 1: like good on you.

774
00:51:29,947 --> 00:51:30,590
Speaker 1: You're in that game.

775
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,916
Speaker 0: Well, they like some people like doing that.

776
00:51:31,936 --> 00:51:32,880
Speaker 0: you're like Etrian Odyssey.

777
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:35,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I understand the appeal of that.

778
00:51:35,712 --> 00:51:38,742
Speaker 1: I did not make any maps in the in any of the mazes.

779
00:51:38,782 --> 00:51:39,585
Speaker 1: I've done recently.

780
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:44,102
Speaker 1: I used the the Variant of the left-hand rule mm-hmm.

781
00:51:44,786 --> 00:51:45,430
Speaker 1: He's got to be careful.

782
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:48,420
Speaker 1: It is possible design maps that have left-hand rule traps.

783
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,483
Speaker 1: It'll take you in loops forever.

784
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:49,945
Speaker 0: Yep.

785
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,009
Speaker 0: Good maze.

786
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:51,812
Speaker 1: Yep That's there.

787
00:51:51,832 --> 00:51:55,810
Speaker 1: That's a real good maze if there's more than one of those traps pro pro maze.

788
00:51:56,691 --> 00:52:03,112
Speaker 1: So uh yeah DRM actually was a much more dangerous topic Early well.

789
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:04,940
Speaker 0: the other thing like before get night.

790
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,590
Speaker 0: the other thing about DRM is like we said is easily broken.

791
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:10,090
Speaker 0: So it's not like if it was not breakable.

792
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:19,076
Speaker 0: This would be a really big problem because so much of the culture of the world would sort of be trapped and like you know For preservation for shit.

793
00:52:19,096 --> 00:52:20,139
Speaker 0: for all these reasons, right?

794
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:23,590
Speaker 0: It's real that could be very harmful, but luckily it's easily breakable, right?

795
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,652
Speaker 0: Yep Here's the thing.

796
00:52:25,214 --> 00:52:35,125
Speaker 0: in the United States at least the DMCA says you may not break DRM Except for these specific exceptions, right like unlocking your phone.

797
00:52:35,145 --> 00:52:36,630
Speaker 0: I think has recently made an exception.

798
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:39,500
Speaker 0: I think so, but I think I'm not 100% sure.

799
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:50,327
Speaker 0: but it's like if you if you break DRM Even in order to do something legal you're not violating copyright You're just breaking DRM for some other reason that is technically against the law to do this.

800
00:52:50,628 --> 00:52:53,970
Speaker 1: Yep Now Portugal might be moving down the road of fixing this.

801
00:52:54,070 --> 00:53:01,015
Speaker 1: I saw an article about that a little while ago doing research for the show, but The problem still is it.

802
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:05,248
Speaker 1: it was way worse earlier partly because are the US government.

803
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,890
Speaker 1: you might Expect that our government's pretty bad about technology stuff.

804
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:26,121
Speaker 1: but there was this golden era from the mid 80s through the end of the 90s early 2000s where Both parties in our government were equally hostile to media technology and the internet and we're basically both Pushing legislation to ruin everything forever.

805
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:31,602
Speaker 1: This was the era of the CBD tPA And if you want to know how bad that law was and how dangerous it was.

806
00:53:31,923 --> 00:53:33,609
Speaker 1: I remember that giant acronym to this day.

807
00:53:34,692 --> 00:53:36,795
Speaker 1: Well initialism, I guess it's not technically an acronym.

808
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:39,360
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but that law basically said something like

809
00:53:39,932 --> 00:53:40,500
Speaker 0: media

810
00:53:41,007 --> 00:54:01,602
Speaker 1: can Must be tied to legitimate devices and can only be played on legitimate light devices by law like a device that can play media of any kind or even arguably a general-purpose computer was effectively banned under that law unless it had Government mandated copyright controls in it.

811
00:54:01,622 --> 00:54:02,084
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

812
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:05,316
Speaker 1: Imagine if you couldn't run Linux Mm-hmm, like that kind of stuff.

813
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:05,677
Speaker 1: Yep.

814
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:08,568
Speaker 1: We've backed way away from that precipice.

815
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:11,301
Speaker 1: That's good And I mean the DMCA.

816
00:54:11,322 --> 00:54:12,490
Speaker 1: it's kind of weak-toothed.

817
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,360
Speaker 1: HDCP was actually broken a long time ago.

818
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:18,168
Speaker 1: Like people have broken that as far as I know.

819
00:54:19,992 --> 00:54:22,110
Speaker 1: These you know DCSS CSS was broken.

820
00:54:22,572 --> 00:54:23,980
Speaker 1: We've had a lot of luck breaking.

821
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:32,450
Speaker 0: most of the copyright DRM enforcement regimes that have been actually dangerous to this is less effort on breaking them lately because you don't need to because you can.

822
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:42,990
Speaker 1: Companies are finally giving you all the content you need but also the Fewer people are outraged about it because back then the outrage was you can't do things that you do today.

823
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,309
Speaker 1: You'll lose access to stuff.

824
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:51,789
Speaker 1: But now because streaming so easy even though the were the streaming ecosystem is pretty heavily locked down.

825
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:56,535
Speaker 1: like unauthorized devices can't play streams You can't cash stuff.

826
00:54:56,836 --> 00:55:00,307
Speaker 1: like until recently Netflix had no way to work if you didn't have internet connections.

827
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:07,350
Speaker 1: and even now Actually Netflix is doing a good thing because their own content they'd let you download in cash locally.

828
00:55:07,573 --> 00:55:08,830
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's partially good.

829
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,276
Speaker 0: But so there's still bad.

830
00:55:10,316 --> 00:55:12,204
Speaker 0: DRM is out there right out the John Deere.

831
00:55:12,244 --> 00:55:17,090
Speaker 0: people can't buy a tractor And then they cannot repair the tractor can't replace the tire.

832
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,870
Speaker 1: You got to get a got to get an authorized tire, right?

833
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:24,815
Speaker 0: And if they if they were to say try to repair their own tractor They would be breaking the DRM.

834
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:37,924
Speaker 0: that's in the tractor software and therefore it's against the law to repair the thing you own Which is why a lot of places are trying to make right to repair laws, which say regardless of any DRM bullshit You can repair something that you buy right?

835
00:55:37,984 --> 00:55:41,276
Speaker 0: You can't be doing this bull Someone else to repair it, right?

836
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,283
Speaker 0: You know, you're not licensing that tractor.

837
00:55:43,324 --> 00:55:43,805
Speaker 0: You own it.

838
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:44,628
Speaker 0: You bought it, right?

839
00:55:44,648 --> 00:55:45,110
Speaker 0: It's yours.

840
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:53,120
Speaker 1: I mean imagine the alternative a world where if you buy a Chevrolet car You can legally only get it serviced at the dealership.

841
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:55,990
Speaker 0: You cannot legally bring it anywhere else nor are you?

842
00:55:56,632 --> 00:56:02,710
Speaker 0: If Chevy goes out of business, you can never repair the car ever and if you open the hood you could go to jail.

843
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,656
Speaker 1: Yep, that's what it would be like.

844
00:56:04,716 --> 00:56:08,749
Speaker 1: That's that's the danger of fully realized and effective DRM.

845
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:14,327
Speaker 1: But replace your car with the collected culture of mankind produced to date.

846
00:56:14,628 --> 00:56:19,210
Speaker 0: Yep So some bad news for Netflix and others, right?

847
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:28,139
Speaker 0: Google and even you know people you normally think of as not evil because they fight for things like net neutrality, but Even Tim Berners-Lee is on the wrong side of this one.

848
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,116
Speaker 0: There's a thing called encrypted media something Yeah, me encrypted media extensions.

849
00:56:33,337 --> 00:56:36,145
Speaker 1: I happen to have the Wikipedia page up about there.

850
00:56:36,225 --> 00:56:38,131
Speaker 0: make the basically as part of HTTP.

851
00:56:38,151 --> 00:56:41,162
Speaker 0: this is the web only not the internet just the web right.

852
00:56:41,182 --> 00:56:43,530
Speaker 0: the standards for the web like HTML, right?

853
00:56:43,911 --> 00:56:45,230
Speaker 1: Yes, listen to old geek nods.

854
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:47,248
Speaker 1: you want to know the difference between the web and the internet

855
00:56:47,268 --> 00:57:00,090
Speaker 0: but the w3c the organization that like decides what the standards for the web are gonna be which is then what People who make web browsers have to basically code to those standards to make sure that websites work on all browsers the same way.

856
00:57:00,694 --> 00:57:13,730
Speaker 0: They decided almost certainly By a vote and the vote can only people who can vote or rich people who can pay to be a member like tens of Thousands of dollars to include DRM, you know these EME and the standards of the web.

857
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:29,309
Speaker 0: So now browsers if they want to be standard will have to include this DRM which would allow You know Netflix and other people to distribute DRM video Into people with just standard web browsers no extra software required.

858
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:31,963
Speaker 1: now There are some sound arguments on both sides.

859
00:57:32,063 --> 00:57:32,244
Speaker 1: there

860
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:33,350
Speaker 0: are there are indeed

861
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:43,879
Speaker 1: I mean the alternative and don't don't say that I'm necessarily speaking for this but One problem is that under the old under the regime where there is no official standard everyone rolls their own and

862
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:50,543
Speaker 0: everyone's using flash or Other everyone's installing some kind of garbage, you know, there's still.

863
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,050
Speaker 0: they're not gonna distribute their content without DRM, right?

864
00:57:53,170 --> 00:58:00,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're gonna distribute the content with DRM there But they're gonna make you install some nonsense to do to get the content or you don't install the nonsense.

865
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:02,470
Speaker 1: So the argument comes down.

866
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,977
Speaker 1: In fact, this article says exactly what the argument is.

867
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:09,689
Speaker 1: the argument comes down to the alternative is not the web abandoning DRM.

868
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:17,890
Speaker 1: It's media companies abandoning the web right and going fully proprietary Mm-hmm, which is probably true a lot of them have already.

869
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:22,830
Speaker 0: I mean that a lot of most people I don't imagine use net watch Netflix things on the Netflix website.

870
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:24,598
Speaker 0: They're going and using an app.

871
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:31,390
Speaker 0: Yep, right usually embedded into some sort of No reason that that app has to talk to Netflix itself.

872
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,898
Speaker 0: Netflix is server infrastructure via HTTP.

873
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:36,848
Speaker 0: it can talk to Netflix using any protocol that they come up with.

874
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:42,370
Speaker 1: Yep So so on one hand this is like from a pure technology standpoint.

875
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,750
Speaker 1: This is a thing people want to do with technology, so we should have some standards.

876
00:58:45,851 --> 00:58:49,130
Speaker 1: So it works interoperably across platforms across browsers.

877
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:58,787
Speaker 1: But on the other hand the thing you're trying to do is from an ideological standpoint fundamentally dangerous to culture in the long run even if it has short-term positive economic impact.

878
00:58:59,008 --> 00:59:02,341
Speaker 1: and let the fact that Capitalism say here's hard to make money here.

879
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:04,550
Speaker 0: the problems here the problems of this particular thing.

880
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:13,187
Speaker 0: Number one if you just include DRM and browsers like this automatic thing People who are currently distributing things for free might just decide to oh, it's really easy.

881
00:59:13,247 --> 00:59:13,989
Speaker 0: use the standard DRM.

882
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:15,014
Speaker 0: It's built into everyone.

883
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:15,576
Speaker 0: Let's just use it.

884
00:59:15,596 --> 00:59:19,010
Speaker 0: and now suddenly all these things are DRM that before were not DRM.

885
00:59:19,152 --> 00:59:25,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, now number two Let's say you make an open source web browser like Firefox or something.

886
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:30,206
Speaker 0: You cannot be including this DRM shit in this open source product, right?

887
00:59:30,226 --> 00:59:31,370
Speaker 0: That's not gonna work out.

888
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:35,249
Speaker 0: That's fundamentally like against your license and such or you can't do this.

889
00:59:35,731 --> 00:59:41,670
Speaker 0: You know, that's a problem depending on the license, of course Debbie and is not going to include a browser that has DRM.

890
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:52,488
Speaker 1: Wikipedia EMA has been highly controversial because a quote places a necessarily proprietary Component into might what is otherwise an open and free software ecosystem.

891
00:59:52,628 --> 00:59:57,010
Speaker 0: Yep Because you have to download the Nvidia driver separately when you install some Linux.

892
00:59:57,032 --> 00:59:59,377
Speaker 1: Yeah Remember how we talked about keys before the.

893
00:59:59,658 --> 01:00:04,935
Speaker 1: the key the code whatever it is that makes us hear it happen is Still just that key.

894
01:00:05,276 --> 01:00:09,030
Speaker 1: so it has to be closed source or it cannot work.

895
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:11,510
Speaker 0: Yeah If it was open source just included in Firefox.

896
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:17,626
Speaker 0: You could just read the source code of Firefox and it would basically have instructions on how to break the DRM in it Which is why it won't right?

897
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:24,410
Speaker 1: I've decided just now I'm oh, I'm for this being implemented and I have a pretty specific reason why.

898
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:30,810
Speaker 1: If we standardize on one way of doing a DRM you crack one key to crack the world.

899
01:00:31,112 --> 01:00:32,922
Speaker 0: Sadly this DRM does not work that way.

900
01:00:33,022 --> 01:00:33,203
Speaker 0: Yeah.

901
01:00:33,244 --> 01:00:37,802
Speaker 1: Yeah as many keys You have to crack you'd have to fundamentally break its system.

902
01:00:38,003 --> 01:00:38,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think it's.

903
01:00:39,007 --> 01:00:43,084
Speaker 0: this is designed Well, the system was made by Google Netflix, etc.

904
01:00:43,205 --> 01:00:44,390
Speaker 0: It's a whole team effort.

905
01:00:44,491 --> 01:00:46,230
Speaker 0: It's gonna be very very hard for you to do that.

906
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:50,350
Speaker 0: Well, the other trouble is that the reason a lot of I do not think it is so fundamentally flawed.

907
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,577
Speaker 0: I think you could obviously well.

908
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:57,530
Speaker 1: the reason why other keys were more easily flawed Is that a lot of the things that consume media or that did DRM in the past?

909
01:00:58,092 --> 01:01:01,461
Speaker 1: Can't reliably have access to an internet and change themselves.

910
01:01:01,481 --> 01:01:02,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is for the web.

911
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:03,306
Speaker 0: It is internet.

912
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:03,587
Speaker 0: Right?

913
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:13,250
Speaker 0: Anyway, the other problem with this is That let's say, you know web browsers are like the most important thing right like in terms of software on your computer.

914
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, the most it's.

915
01:01:14,475 --> 01:01:16,785
Speaker 0: the number one application of the internet is the web.

916
01:01:17,348 --> 01:01:24,923
Speaker 0: So People are constantly, you know Particularly security people, you know working on browsers.

917
01:01:25,324 --> 01:01:45,170
Speaker 0: if browsers include DRM You might accidentally even though you're not trying to pirate any movies or anything Break the DRM while you're messing around with browsers because that's what you do Especially if you're a security investigator type person trying to find, you know security problems in the browser Security problems in that DRM that could threaten your whole computer.

918
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:52,969
Speaker 0: someone might use a flaw in the DRM system to just you know, turn your computer into You know some kind of spam bot or whatever.

919
01:01:53,431 --> 01:02:00,630
Speaker 0: Security researchers might have to mess around with this DRM, but doing so is against the law because it's DRM and it's not something else.

920
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,330
Speaker 0: So that's a problem.

921
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:17,410
Speaker 1: Here's some quotes while backers developers of Firefox were hesitant implementing the protocol for ethical reasons and dependency on proprietary code Firefox's implementation of it uses an open source sandbox to load the DRM modules which are treated as plugins.

922
01:02:18,233 --> 01:02:23,233
Speaker 1: So they have this convoluted way to get around some of the potentially thorny legal Problems.

923
01:02:23,575 --> 01:02:27,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically, you know, the web is a hundred percent open right now.

924
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:31,789
Speaker 0: And now that this is basically saying, you know what some part of the web is not gonna be open now?

925
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:39,169
Speaker 1: Yep But the previous alternative was some parts of the web like in websites would be black holes with flash or something.

926
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:45,086
Speaker 1: Sure So it's replacing Non-standard black holes with standard widely implemented black holes.

927
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:59,045
Speaker 1: great It's hard to predict what specific impact this might have Because on one hand it might make for an easier proliferation of more streaming services and things like that but it could very easily be used for evil.

928
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:03,401
Speaker 0: and I think you'll see consumer benefits in that.

929
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:08,330
Speaker 0: you'll be able to just get like 4k Surround sound Netflix streams right in the browser.

930
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,012
Speaker 0: You'll

931
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:26,190
Speaker 1: see a consumer detriment in that only Windows and Macs will be able to be used to watch stuff forever after this point Like your Linux box ain't gonna work with any of this stuff probably unless you install proprietary closed-source browsers Depending on your distro by going out of band because they won't give them to you.

932
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:33,070
Speaker 0: It's gonna be one of those things where like the negative effects are all Even if they're significant or in the tech world where normal people don't see or care.

933
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,728
Speaker 0: But tech people are gonna go like and it's gonna suck ass.

934
01:03:35,889 --> 01:03:46,184
Speaker 1: now The hope will be if it expands into causing the further dangers beyond the expected dangers Like even normal people were afraid of the CBD tPA and like.

935
01:03:46,224 --> 01:03:47,850
Speaker 1: we're able to stop that nonsense?

936
01:03:47,991 --> 01:04:00,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we got to make sure that the laws protecting these systems do not become worse than they already are and we need right to repair and right to archive and Right to study and right to research and all these other.

937
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:05,057
Speaker 0: you start seeing shit like wayback machine can't archive any pages anymore Cuz they're all DRM.

938
01:04:05,158 --> 01:04:06,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

939
01:04:06,507 --> 01:04:06,970
Speaker 0: It's a problem.

940
01:04:07,332 --> 01:04:10,325
Speaker 1: So there's nothing for you out there to do like.

941
01:04:10,486 --> 01:04:12,280
Speaker 1: there's no activism You can do on this cuz.

942
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,830
Speaker 0: yeah, it's already too late The final draft is in and you weren't rich enough to get a vote.

943
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:24,790
Speaker 1: Anyway, all you can do is keep an eye on this Like be aware that this exists and pay attention to when it starts encroaching.

944
01:04:25,271 --> 01:04:34,677
Speaker 1: That's that's literally all you can do and figure out the line at which you start trying to get non nerds To be angry about it because no one's gonna care.

945
01:04:34,718 --> 01:04:38,990
Speaker 1: right now the the feast at the buffet of streaming is still too great.

946
01:04:45,265 --> 01:04:47,800
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

970
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:27,675
Speaker 1: So I'm I have some content I haven't uploaded yet because I'm trying to figure out what happened there first.

971
01:06:27,957 --> 01:06:30,336
Speaker 1: It wasn't just me It was everything in patreon as far as I can see.

972
01:06:31,462 --> 01:06:40,632
Speaker 1: Expect a whole bunch of rants and roomly reviews and other stuff to be coming up in the near future Now that I have a long break between conventions.
