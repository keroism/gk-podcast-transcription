1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,928
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, May 26th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:10,109
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:13,957
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,385
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:20,640
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are reviewing Spider-Man 2099.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,638
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,700
Speaker 1: So, uh, I have not been called up for jury duty in like a decade.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,184
Speaker 0: We just talked about it.

9
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:36,371
Speaker 0: You can figure out our whole jury duty history by listening to enough Geek Nights, 'cause every time we have a jury duty, we do an episode on it.

10
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,739
Speaker 0: It's the opening bit guaranteed, no matter what.

11
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:55,920
Speaker 1: We'll probably remind you that if you're on a jury, you have a natural de facto right to nullify, in that even if someone is clearly guilty, and you're instructed just to decide if they are guilty, you can still vote not guilty if you believe the law itself is unjust, or you think the punishment is unjust.

12
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:57,649
Speaker 0: Or you just fucking feel like it.

13
00:00:57,669 --> 00:00:58,212
Speaker 0: It's like...

14
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,346
Speaker 1: It's not illegal.

15
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,252
Speaker 1: They can't stop you.

16
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:02,420
Speaker 1: They can't know your hearts.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,700
Speaker 0: They can give you all the instructions they want, but at the end of the day, it's like the reason you're there is 'cause you have the power to choose guilty or not guilty.

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,840
Speaker 1: Jury of your peers.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,952
Speaker 0: No one can make you choose in the United States, either one.

20
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:17,340
Speaker 0: It's up to you what you choose entirely.

21
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:22,000
Speaker 0: And if you just have some other reason, you know, you can Google jury nullification on your own.

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,481
Speaker 0: Yep.

23
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:24,780
Speaker 1: I suggest you do if you get called up for jury duty.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,957
Speaker 1: But I gotta go back in tomorrow, and I am 100% sure they will never, ever in my life.

25
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:32,140
Speaker 1: let me sit on a jury.

26
00:01:32,523 --> 00:01:34,680
Speaker 0: Even though I really would like to be on a jury.

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:42,899
Speaker 0: What two lawyers opposing each other would both look at... It could be that one of them is looking at Rem and saying, "Oh yeah, he's gonna say what I want him to

28
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:43,100
Speaker 0: say.".

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,255
Speaker 1: And the other one's gonna be like, "He just said he hates the

30
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:45,638
Speaker 1: cops.".

31
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:47,215
Speaker 0: The other one would be like, "Fuck

32
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:47,478
Speaker 0: no.".

33
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:56,334
Speaker 0: There is no way that two opposing lawyers would both take Rem in, question him, hear his answers, and both say, "Fuck yeah, going on my jury.

34
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:56,897
Speaker 0: I like this

35
00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:57,240
Speaker 0: guy.".

36
00:01:57,501 --> 00:02:02,320
Speaker 1: The last time I went through Vardear, like, it was almost a scene from a comedy movie.

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,360
Speaker 1: They asked me a question, I gave a short, honest answer, and I thought they were gonna, like, follow up or grill me because the answer was an atypical one.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,600
Speaker 1: Like, it was the one they wouldn't expect.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,338
Speaker 1: But instead, literally, both lawyers kind of look at each other and they raise their hands, and I was just dismissed with no more words, and that was it.

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,199
Speaker 1: The question was, "Would you trust the testimony of a law enforcement officer over the testimony of a private

41
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:25,540
Speaker 1: citizen?".

42
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:27,557
Speaker 1: And I said, "Absolutely

43
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:27,819
Speaker 1: not.".

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,173
Speaker 1: Kind of waiting for them to, like, ask me why, and they were just like, "Nope.

45
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:34,197
Speaker 1: Get out of here.

46
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:34,679
Speaker 1: You're done.

47
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:34,919
Speaker 1: Go

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,060
Speaker 1: home.".

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,178
Speaker 0: And it's like, "I will trust the testimony of any human equal to any other

50
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:40,519
Speaker 0: human.".

51
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,740
Speaker 1: I would actually trust the testimony of a cop less than a private citizen.

52
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,671
Speaker 0: Could be, depends, you know, but equal at most, right?

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,640
Speaker 1: But also, I don't trust eyewitness testimony at all because I know that it's mostly bullshit.

54
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,199
Speaker 0: Of course not.

55
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:55,372
Speaker 1: I'm going to judge based on evidence.

56
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,360
Speaker 0: I'm judging going to be based on the physical evidence more than is going to outweigh what anyone says by, like, a thousand.

57
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:07,840
Speaker 1: So, yeah, in the news, we're not going to, like, do a full review here.

58
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,740
Speaker 1: We'll talk about spoilers and go in-depth on this.

59
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,360
Speaker 1: At some, like, when the last Adventure Time special comes out, we'll probably do a show.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,512
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did episodes on the first two.

61
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:17,840
Speaker 0: They're only making four.

62
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:23,460
Speaker 0: I really didn't feel like making four Geek Nights episodes for four Adventure Time episodes.

63
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,915
Speaker 1: Because we only do 26 animation episodes a year on average now.

64
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,012
Speaker 0: Yeah, so...

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,600
Speaker 1: So four twenty-sixths of Geek Nights becomes Adventure Time?

66
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,498
Speaker 1: We already turned, what, five twenty-sixths of Geek Nights into train game reviews?

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,060
Speaker 0: If they do, if after the next one, the Peppermint Butler one, they're not doing any more, we'll do an episode.

68
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,640
Speaker 0: But if they announce, like, "Hey, we're going to do some more even," then we'll hold off, I guess, even longer.

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think it's worth Geek Biting because we did watch Finn and Jake together again, the third installment.

70
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,655
Speaker 1: Uh, Geek Biting, what I would say is it's good.

71
00:03:58,997 --> 00:03:59,460
Speaker 1: It's solid.

72
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:00,539
Speaker 0: It is good.

73
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,620
Speaker 1: I think it's the, it's either the weakest of the three new Distant Lands episodes.

74
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,039
Speaker 0: That's not to say, it's not weak.

75
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,518
Speaker 1: It's just like saying, "Oh, I had this great, like, custom donut, and then I had this fancy eclair, and then I had a really good

76
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:16,100
Speaker 1: milkshake.".

77
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,440
Speaker 1: Like, yeah, the milkshake might have been the weakest of those three, but it was still amazing.

78
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:20,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,754
Speaker 1: Uh, the one thing I would say, though, is that it was poignant.

80
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,100
Speaker 1: It hit moderately hard.

81
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:27,418
Speaker 1: I got a little bit choked up.

82
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:33,720
Speaker 1: But it also didn't actually, like, push any particular boundaries.

83
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:38,680
Speaker 1: It didn't really do anything particularly new or different.

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:49,700
Speaker 1: And I would even argue that the major beats and moments and the story it told were already told by the show itself, and this didn't add anything.

85
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,715
Speaker 1: But I still enjoyed watching it.

86
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:54,919
Speaker 0: I agree with that.

87
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,600
Speaker 1: Like, I don't think it's a different opinion of the characters, and even the Jake thing is 100% derivable from having just seen the show.

88
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:09,440
Speaker 0: The other ones, I think, had some sort of higher concept in some sense or another.

89
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Beemo one the most.

90
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,244
Speaker 1: Because it played with the timeline.

91
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:18,039
Speaker 1: It also played with your expectations about what Beemo's up to.

92
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,738
Speaker 1: That character who is so 100% obviously looks exactly like Finn's dad, and you're like, "I wonder what the deal is with

93
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:24,999
Speaker 1: that?".

94
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:27,039
Speaker 1: Like, there's good stuff there.

95
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
Speaker 0: This one was just really straightforward.

96
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:35,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was just taking what it was on its face and just sort of tying it up in a way, right?

97
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,809
Speaker 0: And then it's like, "Okay, but you didn't try to go anywhere

98
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:39,411
Speaker 0: new.".

99
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:43,938
Speaker 0: It wasn't as necessary.

100
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:47,873
Speaker 0: Not even just story-wise, but art-wise or anything like that.

101
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:58,520
Speaker 1: The Beemo one did interesting stuff and also explored an unexplored aspect of what is Beemo like when these other people aren't around for real on a real mission.

102
00:05:58,601 --> 00:05:59,560
Speaker 1: Like a real adventure.

103
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:07,660
Speaker 1: Marceline and Bubble Gun, that one just resolved their relationship and a big chunk of the world around them in a really good way.

104
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,360
Speaker 1: And this one just kind of told you something that if you were even remotely perceptive to the show, you already knew.

105
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:19,000
Speaker 1: I guess the part I actually like the most is the whole thing with death.

106
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:26,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that's a whole part of the universe that did not get enough screen time in the show.

107
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,800
Speaker 1: In fact, I think most of the screen time that those characters get in the show are in those specials, and you don't actually get much plot, if anything, around them.

108
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:44,500
Speaker 0: Right, it's like that part of the universe where death is is sort of established in some episodes.

109
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:52,500
Speaker 0: There's one episode that really goes in on it, but other than that, there are other parts of the universe to get more attention.

110
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:01,456
Speaker 0: So, going back there was cool, but going back there in this way was sort of like, "Well, I didn't really learn anything more.

111
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:03,199
Speaker 0: I learned some more about it, but not that

112
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:03,480
Speaker 0: interesting.".

113
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:12,560
Speaker 1: Well, the most compelling arc was between life, death, and the third unnamed character, those three, because that did the stuff I like about Adventure Time.

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,043
Speaker 1: It didn't explain everything.

115
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:16,409
Speaker 1: It gave you just enough.

116
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:21,080
Speaker 1: You know the gist of these characters, and you just have to infer a lot of what happened.

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,047
Speaker 1: You don't know the whole story, and it was sad.

118
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,977
Speaker 1: Life being angry was a very good moment.

119
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,300
Speaker 1: That was well animated and fun.

120
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's good.

121
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,182
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's worth watching.

122
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:33,986
Speaker 1: It's Adventure Time.

123
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:37,775
Speaker 1: It is better than the weakest episode of Adventure Time.

124
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:39,759
Speaker 1: Not that I could even name what that episode might be.

125
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:43,888
Speaker 1: All right, you got any other news?

126
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:45,900
Speaker 1: I guess I got a couple little things we can talk about.

127
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's not any big news.

128
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:49,408
Speaker 0: I don't know.

129
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,511
Speaker 0: There's that camera news.

130
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:51,754
Speaker 0: Do people care?

131
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:52,054
Speaker 0: I don't know.

132
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,980
Speaker 1: I don't know if Wednesday people care.

133
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,720
Speaker 0: Right, considering we just talked about digital cameras, and then suddenly a news comes that changes some of what we said.

134
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:10,659
Speaker 0: But yeah, the camera that I have that I use for pretty much all our video stuff and also some photo stuff is the Panasonic GH5.

135
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:15,377
Speaker 0: The GH4 was pretty much like the first camera.

136
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:19,080
Speaker 1: The X1, and then I have a fancy Panasonic camcorder.

137
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, which was one of the first ones to do 4K video at any kind of reasonable consumer accessible price.

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,166
Speaker 0: And the GH5 expanded upon that.

139
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,960
Speaker 0: But now, nowadays, everyone else has gotten into that market.

140
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,827
Speaker 0: So it's like, what's Panasonic going to do?

141
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:40,640
Speaker 0: They started this thing, kind of, and everyone else has come and been eating their lunch away.

142
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,225
Speaker 0: You know, Nikon, Canon, Sony, everybody.

143
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:49,920
Speaker 0: So they announced the GH5 II and the GH6 is coming later this year.

144
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:54,360
Speaker 0: They announced it exists, and they gave some specs, but not all the specs, right?

145
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:07,832
Speaker 0: And basically what the deal is, the GH6 is going to record at not 6K or 8K, but 5 point something K. Right, so more than 4K at like 60, right?

146
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:09,837
Speaker 0: It's like ridiculous, and it's going to cost $2,500.

147
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:10,157
Speaker 0: That's a lot.

148
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:18,134
Speaker 0: And it's like, okay, if you are someone who's a filmmaker or something like that, still $2,500 for better than 4K video.

149
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,079
Speaker 0: It's like, you're waiting for that, right?

150
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,660
Speaker 1: Now, it's interesting, on the Panasonic website, they have a big caveat noted about it, saying that because they have an estimate.

151
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:30,538
Speaker 0: Nothing is final.

152
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:39,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, the recording time, but they make a prominent note that the camera's video recording time is limited by its own temperature.

153
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:40,978
Speaker 0: Yep.

154
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:50,200
Speaker 1: That is something we didn't talk about on the show, that the large fancy camcorders, one thing they do have often is active cooling.

155
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:55,878
Speaker 1: So they can record, I could use my camcorder for 12 hours constantly, in hot weather.

156
00:09:55,938 --> 00:09:56,460
Speaker 1: it'll be fine.

157
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:06,200
Speaker 0: Panasonic, they have the BGH, which is one of those box style ones, where it's literally just a box that you put a lens on and everything else is external to that, that you have to attach yourself.

158
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,285
Speaker 0: And that one, I believe, has fans in it, right?

159
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:15,419
Speaker 0: But if you have the carry around, you know, sort of SLR shaped cameras, they usually don't have fans on them.

160
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:18,540
Speaker 0: So the cooling is a factor.

161
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:24,999
Speaker 0: But the GH5 II, they were announcing all the upgrades of the GH5 II versus the GH5.

162
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,080
Speaker 0: And I already have a GH5, so those upgrades got to be something significant to make me want to switch over, right?

163
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:38,000
Speaker 0: And switching over actually wouldn't be, you know, prohibitive because I could sell my GH5 after I get the GH5 II and I'm just paying the difference.

164
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:40,919
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like an upgrade fee, if you think about it that way.

165
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,238
Speaker 1: I would even consider buying it from you just because all I have is an old GX1.

166
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,579
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

167
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:51,459
Speaker 1: The problem with the X is, it's actually a fine camera for like what I do.

168
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,340
Speaker 1: The problem is, what I would want to use it for is a secondary video camera.

169
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,957
Speaker 1: The X, the GX cannot output HDMI.

170
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,560
Speaker 0: No, it can't do that.

171
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:06,160
Speaker 1: It can record video, but I had to hack the firmware to record more than like 20 minutes of video because of that stupid EU tax law thing.

172
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,372
Speaker 0: So they're announcing all these features for the GH5 II versus the GH5.

173
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:13,160
Speaker 0: And they're nice features, right?

174
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,200
Speaker 0: Better image stabilization, which is already amazing on the GH5, and they're making it better.

175
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,756
Speaker 0: You know, more FPS on the 4K.

176
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:25,760
Speaker 0: You know, you get the vlog included instead of having to buy it.

177
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,940
Speaker 1: Ah, they did warn you the GH5 II also does not do raw video output.

178
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:31,739
Speaker 0: No, almost no one does that.

179
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:33,959
Speaker 0: Only like the ultra pro cameras do that.

180
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,620
Speaker 0: You know, all these really nice features, right?

181
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,200
Speaker 0: They're announcing, but I'm like, you know what?

182
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,219
Speaker 0: Those are all really nice.

183
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:42,217
Speaker 0: You know, if I was buying a brand new camera today, obviously I would get the GH5 II.

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,660
Speaker 0: But those are not worth going through the hassle of paying $1,700 for the new one and then selling the old one, right?

185
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,559
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like, cause none of those things really matter for what I do.

186
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:58,700
Speaker 0: And then they come out and the last thing they say is like, by the way, also the camera can just stream on its own directly to YouTube.

187
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,439
Speaker 1: Like we said, all the good new cameras are doing this.

188
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:08,520
Speaker 0: It's like camera, you can just have camera and that, and that, and just if you've got wifi somewhere, or you can even use your phone as a hotspot and use that wifi.

189
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:14,180
Speaker 0: And the camera will go from the camera to YouTube or Twitch or Facebook live.

190
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:14,869
Speaker 0: That's it.

191
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,479
Speaker 0: That's all you need.

192
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,280
Speaker 0: Camera, internet service, no other equipment necessary.

193
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:24,599
Speaker 0: And I'm like, God, that's the one feature to add that to the GH5.

194
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:28,420
Speaker 0: I would have to carry around like a thousand dollar extra piece of equipment.

195
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:31,320
Speaker 0: And they're just gonna include that shit in the camera.

196
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:34,760
Speaker 1: Or a hundred dollar piece of equipment that won't work and might catch fire.

197
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,202
Speaker 0: Exactly.

198
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:39,900
Speaker 0: And I'm like, well, maybe I will buy the new one and then upgrade.

199
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,427
Speaker 0: But I have a lot of other questions.

200
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:43,899
Speaker 0: I'm gonna, I'm gonna get the answers to these other questions.

201
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:50,520
Speaker 0: They actually, so Panasonic did say- My strategy is I put in a pre-order just in case, but I can cancel it.

202
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,422
Speaker 0: I can cancel it.

203
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:57,340
Speaker 0: So when I, if I don't like the answers to my questions that are technical and not necessary to discuss on the show.

204
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:58,826
Speaker 0: I'll cancel my pre-order.

205
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:02,000
Speaker 0: But if the questions have good answers, then I'll be, I'll be good.

206
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:07,060
Speaker 1: So they made a point actually Panasonic about why they don't include raw output in these.

207
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,049
Speaker 1: It's not because they can't.

208
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:09,620
Speaker 0: It's because- It's sort of pointless.

209
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:19,900
Speaker 1: It's pointless because one, their image processing in the camera is better than what anyone who would use this camera professionally would probably do on their own with the raw footage.

210
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,198
Speaker 1: Like it's a lot of work to take raw footage and make it look good.

211
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,135
Speaker 1: Yep.

212
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,360
Speaker 1: Like we do, like I do with raw photos in Lightroom.

213
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:33,160
Speaker 0: It's not really, it's not really saving you anything unless you're ultra, ultra, you know, Hollywood in case you're not using this camera.

214
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:33,800
Speaker 1: Yep.

215
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:46,580
Speaker 1: But also that they encode at a bit rate, basically the way the camera encodes the video it saves and outputs is pretty good, like better than their previous iterations of cameras.

216
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:49,313
Speaker 1: So they basically were pretty open about why they made that decision.

217
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:50,720
Speaker 1: If you want to read more.

218
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,979
Speaker 0: So we'll, we'll see how that goes.

219
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,410
Speaker 0: Yeah.

220
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:53,894
Speaker 0: So that's a, that's a news.

221
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:54,420
Speaker 0: Any other news?

222
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

223
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:08,080
Speaker 1: So in some little news, it's kind of been for since Fujiko Mine came out, we've hit an era where Lupin generally is pretty good when it comes out and that track seems to be continuing.

224
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:10,159
Speaker 1: Like the 3D CG movie was good.

225
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,080
Speaker 0: Yeah.

226
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:16,640
Speaker 0: There was a period of time where like Lupin, you know, Lupin never truly faded from the world of anime, right?

227
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:25,120
Speaker 0: But, you know, there, the quantity of Lupin product being pushed at any given time has waxed and waned and it waned quite a bit.

228
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,669
Speaker 0: In fact, at the time when our interest was the highest in our, in the college days, right?

229
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:35,140
Speaker 0: There was only, we were mostly watching older ones and newer ones weren't coming out too much.

230
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,209
Speaker 0: So like the later two thousands, they started to come right more.

231
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:41,720
Speaker 0: And now at the anniversary times, they're coming at a steadier clip, right?

232
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:51,260
Speaker 0: So yeah, there's more Lupins coming out lately and they're all seem to be at this relatively very good quality level.

233
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:57,297
Speaker 0: I don't want to say they're S tier or even A tier, but it's like, I don't see any bad ones.

234
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:58,420
Speaker 0: I don't see any bad ones.

235
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,708
Speaker 1: So if you want to get back on the Lupin train, one, you could just watch that 3D CG movie.

236
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:04,349
Speaker 1: Like it's fine.

237
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,380
Speaker 1: But two, Fujiko Mine is the one that kind of started this new era of Lupin.

238
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,459
Speaker 1: And it is a fantastic show that you should watch.

239
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:23,240
Speaker 1: So, uh, the news is what we're getting specifically is there's going to be a sixth full on Lupin TV anime specifically.

240
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,193
Speaker 0: How many episodes?

241
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:25,240
Speaker 0: 26?

242
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,632
Speaker 1: It doesn't actually say yet.

243
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:27,600
Speaker 1: I'm digging through this.

244
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,619
Speaker 0: Some of those Lupin TV series were longer, right?

245
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,741
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

246
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:31,062
Speaker 1: Yeah.

247
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:33,708
Speaker 1: So part five was the one that was out.

248
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:39,100
Speaker 1: It doesn't tell me yet how many episodes are going to be in part six, but it's for the 50th anniversary.

249
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:40,182
Speaker 0: Yep.

250
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:42,026
Speaker 1: Okay.

251
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:42,387
Speaker 1: Yep.

252
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:48,560
Speaker 1: And the other little news we got, so Funimation has added a few more shows and, uh, they're a little bit notable.

253
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,090
Speaker 1: Uh, God messenger, not that I've watched much messenger.

254
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:54,960
Speaker 1: God messenger comes later, right?

255
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:02,760
Speaker 0: Yes, it's messenger Z, great messenger, and then I think God messenger is after that.

256
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:10,901
Speaker 0: It's like, uh, you know, so it seems like it seems like the Lupin part five series just came out in 2018.

257
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:16,040
Speaker 0: So it's three years old and that one has like 24 episodes, I think.

258
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,876
Speaker 0: So I imagine that the sixth one will also have a similar 24 episode run just by guessing.

259
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,280
Speaker 0: I have no confirmation on that.

260
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:31,600
Speaker 1: That little Nemo anime they picked up, which I've never actually seen except some clips, but honestly, it looks pretty good.

261
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:34,835
Speaker 0: I've just never, just read the original little Nemo comics.

262
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:35,759
Speaker 0: That's where the action is.

263
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:37,366
Speaker 0: I could watch a couple episodes.

264
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:40,180
Speaker 1: The NES game was pretty good too, though it was really hard.

265
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

266
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:45,540
Speaker 0: I mean, little Nemo is this thing where it's like, uh, for Windsor McKay, right?

267
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:54,020
Speaker 0: Uh, is ridiculously good, but it's in public domain and that's why you keep seeing it coming back and being published in all sorts of places, right?

268
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,304
Speaker 0: Because anyone can do it.

269
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:56,568
Speaker 0: It's public domain.

270
00:16:56,588 --> 00:17:00,240
Speaker 0: So that'll be so awesome when that happens to something more popular than little Nemo.

271
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:08,460
Speaker 1: The NES game was just really fun because it's got all these little animals that you can kind of like crawl into their skin or ride them around and it had a lot going on for an NES game.

272
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a bad NES game at all.

273
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,160
Speaker 1: And, uh, Space Adventure Cobra, the original one, is also going to be on Funimation now.

274
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,769
Speaker 0: I think it's on Crunchyroll already.

275
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:19,400
Speaker 0: I kind of want to watch it.

276
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:21,566
Speaker 1: I have planned to watch it for a long time.

277
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,700
Speaker 1: Way back, way, way back, Gerald at Anime World Order was of all people.

278
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,880
Speaker 0: Gerald is like, Gerald is like Cobra fan number one, right?

279
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,141
Speaker 0: Yep.

280
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:32,171
Speaker 1: But he sold me on it and I just haven't, I've seen some episodes.

281
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,937
Speaker 1: I just never watched like a lot of it.

282
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:34,700
Speaker 1: I never watched the whole thing.

283
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,924
Speaker 0: I think I watched one episode.

284
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:40,980
Speaker 0: I think there was like a newer, newer one, like a remake or a, you know, some, a newer version at some point.

285
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,160
Speaker 1: I watched, I think we might have even reviewed that on Geek Notes.

286
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,520
Speaker 0: And I think I watched one or a few episodes of that.

287
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,240
Speaker 1: Did we talk about that or not?

288
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:51,093
Speaker 0: Check our, search our website.

289
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:51,478
Speaker 0: I don't know.

290
00:17:52,824 --> 00:17:54,800
Speaker 0: If we did, it was so long ago, right?

291
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,067
Speaker 1: That would have been ancient times.

292
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,820
Speaker 1: I don't think we have ever reviewed it on Geek Nights.

293
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:02,700
Speaker 1: Well, alright, put that in the hopper.

294
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,240
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

295
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:14,593
Speaker 1: This is not a new artist, but I bumped into this song recently and it's great.

296
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:17,060
Speaker 1: if you've never heard of Brushy One String.

297
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:19,360
Speaker 0: I have not heard of Brushy One String.

298
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,900
Speaker 1: He's a cool Jamaican singer and his shtick is that he sings while drumming on and playing a guitar that has one string on it.

299
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,240
Speaker 1: He's just Brushy One String.

300
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,060
Speaker 1: And he does the song Chicken in the Corn.

301
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,260
Speaker 1: Apparently it was made famous in a documentary, pseudo-documentary that I've, I guess there's a real documentary.

302
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,160
Speaker 1: I haven't actually seen it, but I've been, it's seen it pop up numerous times in conversation.

303
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:44,559
Speaker 1: And I've made a point that I want to watch it at some point.

304
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,060
Speaker 1: Rise Up, which is about the underground music scene in Jamaica.

305
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:52,199
Speaker 1: And it looks like a really good documentary.

306
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:57,520
Speaker 1: But apparently this guy was featured in it and his music is popular.

307
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,696
Speaker 1: He only has three albums out.

308
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,540
Speaker 1: But check this guy out, because this song is really good and really catchy.

309
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,539
Speaker 1: It's a really good video.

310
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:05,834
Speaker 0: Okay.

311
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,698
Speaker 0: So, manga genius Naoka Urasawa, right, who made Monster, Pluto, 20th Century Boys, etc.

312
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:20,000
Speaker 0: Apparently had a YouTube channel.

313
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:22,959
Speaker 0: I didn't know that until recently, so I subscribed to it.

314
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,580
Speaker 0: But most of the videos I saw when I went to it weren't subtitled.

315
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,140
Speaker 0: And I was, and you know, were not really useful to watch without subtitles.

316
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,040
Speaker 0: So, I didn't really watch any.

317
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,240
Speaker 0: I saw one show up in my feed, like, today.

318
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,058
Speaker 0: And it said it had a big thing on the thumbnail, "ing

319
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:40,400
Speaker 0: sub."

320
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:41,600
Speaker 0: And I'm like, well, click.

321
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,898
Speaker 0: I'm clicking on that.

322
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:47,000
Speaker 0: But most of the video is actually not Urasawa talking.

323
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:50,100
Speaker 0: He talks in the beginning and at the end to sort of introduce what the video is.

324
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,320
Speaker 0: But what he is doing in the video is just illustrating one scene, right?

325
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,900
Speaker 0: Just a character from his current manga Asadora, right?

326
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:05,180
Speaker 0: Just standing, like, on a road, right, facing out of the paper, right?

327
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:09,300
Speaker 0: But he draws it using, I guess, like, fountain pen.

328
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, that looks like a fountain pen.

329
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:16,900
Speaker 0: And he doesn't, he intentionally, this isn't his normal process, right?

330
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,080
Speaker 0: But he intentionally does not pencil beforehand.

331
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:21,479
Speaker 0: He's just fountain pen only.

332
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:35,799
Speaker 0: And he explains in the video how he's trying to show you, right, how, like, you know, he draws some lines and then how the, you know, the emotion of the scene, like, appears at, like, a certain moment, right, in his process there.

333
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:43,300
Speaker 0: And most of the video is almost entirely uncut footage of just him drawing the whole thing.

334
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:47,600
Speaker 0: Like, every line he draws is on video here, right?

335
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,793
Speaker 0: I don't know if it cuts away from him to go to the bathroom at any point, but it didn't look like it.

336
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,520
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of cuts, right?

337
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,820
Speaker 0: It's just him, his entire drawing from blank paper to completed.

338
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,859
Speaker 0: And it's just, like, this fucking genius guy.

339
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:06,320
Speaker 0: And then at the end, he's, like, you know, he's, like, you do a drawing and there's just so many things you want to improve.

340
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,900
Speaker 0: And I'm, like, what the fuck are you going to improve?

341
00:21:08,181 --> 00:21:11,000
Speaker 0: He's, like, really makes you want to, makes you want to draw better the next day.

342
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:11,978
Speaker 0: And I'm, like, fuck you.

343
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:14,080
Speaker 1: Or is that me going around just recently?

344
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,220
Speaker 0: I can't even draw, I can't even draw a goddamn stick figure.

345
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,700
Speaker 0: And he's sitting there being that, like, that, you know, artist, the typical artist.

346
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,280
Speaker 0: He's, like, oh, my beautiful drawing that I made with the fountain pen and no pencil beforehand.

347
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:26,880
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you know, it's got so many problems.

348
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,619
Speaker 0: I'm, like, oh, my God.

349
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,737
Speaker 0: He starts by drawing, the drawing begins, right?

350
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:36,440
Speaker 0: He's drawing the hand attached to a hat before he draws the head underneath the hat, right?

351
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:39,559
Speaker 0: So he starts by drawing a hand attached to the brim of a hat.

352
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:42,839
Speaker 1: Because that's the emotional center of the scene.

353
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,019
Speaker 0: And then he draws the head and the neck.

354
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:50,220
Speaker 0: And then somehow the arm, the arm comes around to meet the hand.

355
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:56,080
Speaker 0: And everything is correct in proportion and angle wise and everything.

356
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:58,520
Speaker 0: Even though the hand was there long before the shoulder.

357
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, if either of us tried to do that, you know, the image where two railroad tracks meet in the middle and they don't line up?

358
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,299
Speaker 0: It's, like, goddamn this guy.

359
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:15,439
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you want to watch, you know, genius Urasawa draw a still picture, here's like YouTube dot com.

360
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:23,060
Speaker 0: And then, you know, while watching the video, I realized, like, you know, I thought, you know, because I think he had a manga.

361
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,299
Speaker 0: Wasn't there like a shonen bat manga he did?

362
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:30,240
Speaker 0: I don't think that ever came out in English, as far as I'm aware, legally.

363
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,480
Speaker 1: If it did, we just didn't notice.

364
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,359
Speaker 0: I have to search again.

365
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:39,400
Speaker 0: But I knew he was working on this Asadora manga, but it's so recent.

366
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,159
Speaker 0: Like, it's it's not that old.

367
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:51,014
Speaker 0: I didn't think it was in English, but I went and I searched and actually volume one came out like January of this year when I wasn't paying attention because, you know, pandemic going on.

368
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:56,380
Speaker 0: So, yeah, there's two volumes out already and volume three is on the order form.

369
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,959
Speaker 0: This month should be out in July.

370
00:22:58,622 --> 00:23:02,835
Speaker 0: So I went and I grabbed volume three onto my order form and I put one and two in my cart.

371
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:05,199
Speaker 0: So maybe we'll talk about that.

372
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:07,760
Speaker 1: All right.

373
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:14,142
Speaker 1: In the moment, we're slowly, cautiously emerging into the world bit by bit with outdoors stuff.

374
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:17,820
Speaker 1: I was a jury duty today, obviously, but then you went to your office one time.

375
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,059
Speaker 1: I went to my office one time.

376
00:23:19,221 --> 00:23:21,737
Speaker 1: I'll go every now and then, but not going to make a habit out of it.

377
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:25,140
Speaker 1: But yeah, no conventions yet.

378
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,660
Speaker 1: Stay tuned on what we're going to do at PAX East online.

379
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,780
Speaker 1: It seems like it's branded PAX East online to replace PAX East.

380
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:39,020
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean, the online PAX is the way they differentiated them geographically because obviously they're worldwide no matter what was time zones.

381
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,421
Speaker 0: Right.

382
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:42,000
Speaker 0: All of they weren't having events around the clock.

383
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,642
Speaker 0: Right.

384
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:48,100
Speaker 0: So the live streams of things were at times in the local time zone of the pack.

385
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Speaker 0: So the existing the car, the two packs on lines that already happened, the West one and the OS one broadcast their events at West local times and also local time.

386
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,060
Speaker 0: So the PAX East online is going to put out its events at East local time.

387
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:15,820
Speaker 0: So if you're in Australia, it'll be really inconvenient for you because all the if you want to watch live or chat live because it will be happening at the, you know, 24 hours opposite whatever or 12 hours opposite whatever time you get the idea.

388
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,960
Speaker 1: But otherwise, obviously no conventions in person anytime soon.

389
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,065
Speaker 1: So we're kind of just waiting.

390
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:28,140
Speaker 1: Everything's still just hanging out in the hopper, starting to prepare the technology and pipelines for the stuff we want to start doing.

391
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:32,940
Speaker 1: Once the pandemic, once we're more in a post COVID world, there's a lot of stuff we've wanted to do.

392
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,866
Speaker 1: This kind of just on hold.

393
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,859
Speaker 1: So I guess stay tuned for a lot of that biz.

394
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,360
Speaker 0: A camera that live streams itself, if we get that thing and it works.

395
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,140
Speaker 0: Right.

396
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:45,600
Speaker 0: It's like suddenly we don't have to do the effort of setting up OBS on the computer.

397
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:48,897
Speaker 0: We don't got to do the effort of editing video.

398
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:49,440
Speaker 0: Right.

399
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:56,080
Speaker 0: We can literally just go somewhere, plug microphones into it somehow, turn it on and just live stream.

400
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,340
Speaker 0: So whether at a convention, just hanging out, playing a board game.

401
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,780
Speaker 0: We can just turn this camera on and push a button and it streams.

402
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:05,580
Speaker 0: You might want to follow us on YouTube, Twitch, wherever.

403
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:14,698
Speaker 0: Because this camera might, you know, if that thing works out, we might just start random unscheduled stream whenever appropriate.

404
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:14,940
Speaker 0: Right.

405
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,216
Speaker 0: So that's ultra low effort for us if it works.

406
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,260
Speaker 0: Ultra low effort.

407
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:20,822
Speaker 1: Yeah.

408
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:27,260
Speaker 1: It also makes some of the larger things that are high effort easier because this reduces the amount of effort necessary.

409
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,816
Speaker 1: But there is a lot of other high effort pieces we got to deal with.

410
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,158
Speaker 1: Being vague because I'm not going to shit talk anything, but stay tuned.

411
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,280
Speaker 0: Exactly.

412
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:41,160
Speaker 1: Book Club book, which I'm reading at a slow, I paused reading it to read a bunch of Spider-Man, but I'm going to resume reading.

413
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,880
Speaker 0: I'm in a reading mood, but I'm pretty much in the mood to read anything.

414
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,900
Speaker 0: So yeah, I used some of my read mood to read what we're about to talk about.

415
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,140
Speaker 0: But prior to that, and probably starting after tonight, I'll do some more Genji reading.

416
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,640
Speaker 0: It helps when it's warm out because then I can go on the balcony and read.

417
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,240
Speaker 0: That's nicer than bed reading.

418
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,899
Speaker 1: Balcony, go to the park right there because Queensbridge Park is just right next door.

419
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,544
Speaker 1: Can't use our little garden yet.

420
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:14,880
Speaker 1: There's like 20 workers and a whole bunch of platforms as they're replacing the entire facade of our stupid building.

421
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:15,880
Speaker 0: Well.

422
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:17,794
Speaker 0: So yeah.

423
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:18,359
Speaker 0: Anyway.

424
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:20,589
Speaker 1: Spider-Man 2099.

425
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:22,798
Speaker 1: I will admit, I had never read any until now.

426
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:30,620
Speaker 1: This was something that Scott would bring this comic up a lot when we were just like early days at RIT.

427
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,392
Speaker 1: Like anytime superheroes came up, Scott would like make a point of saying, "Oh yeah, Spider-Man 2099.

428
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:38,236
Speaker 1: That was the good one.

429
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:38,779
Speaker 1: That's the one I

430
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:39,000
Speaker 1: read.".

431
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,321
Speaker 0: Yeah.

432
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:51,680
Speaker 0: So yeah, so the backstory is that when I was a kid in the early 90s, I didn't really, you know, I read comics in the newspaper and I enjoyed a Spider-Man or whatever, but I wasn't reading comic books, comic books.

433
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,000
Speaker 0: And then a friend down the kid who lived down the street was reading comic books.

434
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:57,460
Speaker 0: And then the comic book store opened in the mall.

435
00:26:58,061 --> 00:27:02,160
Speaker 0: So once the comic book store opened in the mall, well, it's like, well now, right, I can buy comic books.

436
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:15,219
Speaker 0: So I went there and while there were many comics characters, I enjoyed like regular old Spider-Man or X-Men and, you know, all the space, cosmic stuff, obviously, you know, mostly Marvel stuff.

437
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:21,260
Speaker 0: All the comics, you know, I just had this thing where I needed to know the whole story.

438
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,140
Speaker 0: I couldn't, even then I was like against the cross.

439
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,520
Speaker 0: I understood these crossovers and I was against them.

440
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Speaker 0: Even then, A, because I didn't have enough money to buy that many comics.

441
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,357
Speaker 0: I was like, no, you're not, I'm not falling for that.

442
00:27:32,438 --> 00:27:32,639
Speaker 0: Right.

443
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,457
Speaker 0: But B, I was like, well, I haven't read, you're on Uncanny X-Men 200 and what?

444
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:40,117
Speaker 0: It's like, I'm not buying 200 comics.

445
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:40,379
Speaker 0: Right.

446
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:47,698
Speaker 0: There weren't trade paperbacks or anything in those early nineties days, you know, and I wanted to start with number one and get the whole story.

447
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:48,040
Speaker 0: Right.

448
00:27:48,622 --> 00:27:50,720
Speaker 0: So there were comics that I would buy.

449
00:27:51,060 --> 00:28:03,680
Speaker 0: I bought this miniseries like NX at one point, which is only like a four issue miniseries, just because it was a cool cyborg dude, but also I could get the whole, I saw number one on the shelf in the comic book store and I'm like, I can read the whole damn thing.

450
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:04,251
Speaker 0: Hooray.

451
00:28:04,394 --> 00:28:04,620
Speaker 0: Right.

452
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:12,496
Speaker 0: So it just coincidence that at that time, 1992, I believe when I was a kid going to comic book store.

453
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:13,160
Speaker 0: Right.

454
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,961
Speaker 0: There was a new thing from Marvel, which is 2099.

455
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:25,513
Speaker 0: They made a whole bunch of comics that were based on the idea that, well, it's the Marvel Universe, but in the year 2099, like almost over 100 years from now.

456
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:27,501
Speaker 0: Right.

457
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:28,646
Speaker 0: Because it was 1992.

458
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:29,972
Speaker 0: So 2099 was sort of like, you know, out there.

459
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:31,841
Speaker 0: Right.

460
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:36,419
Speaker 0: And it's sort of a cyberpunk universe because it's so far out there.

461
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:39,893
Speaker 0: And what they did is they had different series.

462
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:41,040
Speaker 0: They had Spider-Man, obviously.

463
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:44,859
Speaker 0: They had X-Men 2099, which I bought the first issue of, but didn't read any more of.

464
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:53,250
Speaker 0: There was Ravage 2099, Punisher 2099, Doom 2099, and maybe some others came later.

465
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,117
Speaker 0: I think there might've been a Fantastic Four 2099 later.

466
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,039
Speaker 0: I could be wrong on that, but at the start they just had this set of them.

467
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:02,320
Speaker 0: So I obviously couldn't afford to buy that in my comic books.

468
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,060
Speaker 0: And as we discussed earlier, I was stupidly spending a lot of money on superhero cards.

469
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,560
Speaker 1: That was something we were talking about a lot in our own life.

470
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:28,018
Speaker 1: I did a similar thing where I would buy these fucking cards and then I'd have them and I'd piece together the stories, or at least try to piece together the stories of superheroes I'd never read because they weren't in the comics I was reading, but it would have been cheaper to just buy the comics they were in.

471
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:31,648
Speaker 0: The first issue of Spider-Man 2099 was $1.75 in 1992 US dollars.

472
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,577
Speaker 0: And nowadays a comic book would be like $3 or $4, a floppy one like that.

473
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,420
Speaker 0: It had a fancy foil sort of cardboard cover and it came with a poster, I think.

474
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:53,365
Speaker 0: But issue two was $1.25 maybe, and I think the price went up over time a little bit, but really cheap.

475
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:57,440
Speaker 0: A pack of cards then was about the same price, maybe even more.

476
00:29:57,721 --> 00:30:01,080
Speaker 1: A pack of cards, because there are a lot of different Marvel cards.

477
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,920
Speaker 0: It depended which cards you bought.

478
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:10,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, the regular ones were about the same price for a pack as the comics, but there was this one series that was fancy, because I remember as a kid, this was probably '92, '93.

479
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:23,720
Speaker 0: The Masterpieces one, which was an advertisement on the back of issue one of Spider-Man 2099, was an ad for Marvel Masterpieces, which were thicker cards with fancier oil painting art.

480
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,360
Speaker 0: They were really unbelievable.

481
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,600
Speaker 0: I have this very good art on these cards.

482
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:33,176
Speaker 1: Very clear memory of being at the Gibraltar Trade Center in Michigan, and those cards were $4 a pack.

483
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were expensive.

484
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:40,206
Speaker 0: I only have a very small number, like a handful of those cards, because they were so much money.

485
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:42,420
Speaker 0: But they're really nice.

486
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,458
Speaker 0: Maybe I could get a full set of them on eBay cheap or something nowadays, right?

487
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:46,820
Speaker 0: Who knows?

488
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:55,180
Speaker 0: Anyway, so when I was a kid, Spider-Man 2099 came at an exact right time, and I bought every issue until the comic book store went out of business.

489
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,369
Speaker 0: So I didn't finish the series, because the comic book store eventually went out of business when that was no longer a thing.

490
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:00,720
Speaker 0: But that was after years, right?

491
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,528
Speaker 0: It's like only 12 issues a year.

492
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,100
Speaker 0: Once a month I'd go to the comic book store and get an issue.

493
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:12,573
Speaker 0: And these issues are tiny, so you're going to get a very small amount of story every month over this very slow pace, right?

494
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:13,537
Speaker 0: I got to like 20 or 30 issues.

495
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,690
Speaker 0: That was like three or four years' worth.

496
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:23,480
Speaker 0: And then the series ended after that, but I wasn't able to get those issues until later in life by using eBay and such.

497
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:25,126
Speaker 0: Much later in life.

498
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:27,660
Speaker 0: I would think I was living in Beacon maybe when I scooped those up.

499
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,404
Speaker 0: The remainders?

500
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:29,230
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

501
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:30,639
Speaker 0: Maybe even later than that.

502
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,026
Speaker 0: So I never read the whole thing as a kid, but I read it every issue every month for a very long period of time.

503
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:51,620
Speaker 0: And also, going back in my mind, as I became an adult and realized, I hadn't read, for example, like William Gibson novels, like pre-college I want to say even, right?

504
00:31:53,828 --> 00:32:00,460
Speaker 0: But when I would read them or watch Ghost in the Shell or something, like all these cyberpunk tropes, like I already understood them, right?

505
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,127
Speaker 0: And I didn't know from where.

506
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:05,661
Speaker 0: And then I realized, oh, it was from Spider-Man 2099.

507
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:10,000
Speaker 0: That's where I learned all cyberpunk related things was from this comic.

508
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,477
Speaker 0: And now reading it again, just yesterday, it's like there's even more stuff.

509
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:19,059
Speaker 0: I can see that this comic borrowed from and introduced me to.

510
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,646
Speaker 1: You know, it's fun because I double checked.

511
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:23,340
Speaker 1: You know what got me into cyberpunk primarily as a kid?

512
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,529
Speaker 1: Because it also came out in 1992, was Shadowrun 2nd Edition.

513
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,120
Speaker 1: Because the first edition was in '89 and the second edition is the book I had.

514
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:33,462
Speaker 0: Yep.

515
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:35,900
Speaker 0: I also just want to briefly, we got to talk about the adverts.

516
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,288
Speaker 0: You know, a comic book, floppy comic books.

517
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,260
Speaker 0: You read this pirated version online, right?

518
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:41,529
Speaker 1: Yep.

519
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:42,645
Speaker 0: Yeah.

520
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:42,807
Speaker 0: Okay.

521
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,160
Speaker 0: So I read the actual comics.

522
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,307
Speaker 1: It's on Comixology, too.

523
00:32:45,368 --> 00:32:45,711
Speaker 1: I checked.

524
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:46,780
Speaker 1: You can actually read it legit.

525
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:47,942
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

526
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:52,979
Speaker 0: But yeah, I read the actual comic books from the 90s that I have, which means the advertisements were still in there.

527
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:54,460
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a treasure.

528
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,180
Speaker 0: So, you know, we say block all ads everywhere always, which is true.

529
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:05,980
Speaker 0: But once the thing an ad is for is no longer a thing, suddenly that ad transforms into art, right?

530
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,840
Speaker 0: Because it's like you can't buy the thing anymore.

531
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,220
Speaker 0: So notable things advertisement-wise, lots of ads for cards of all shapes and sizes.

532
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,990
Speaker 1: Cards for so big back then.

533
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:18,497
Speaker 1: Not that they're not big now, but...

534
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,960
Speaker 0: Ads for foods like Charleston Chew or, you know, Justice Fruit Pie equivalent, right?

535
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,380
Speaker 0: Lots of SNES and Game Boy game ads, right?

536
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,109
Speaker 0: I mean, '92 is some peak SNES time.

537
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,880
Speaker 0: Hook for SNES, you know, things of that nature.

538
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,878
Speaker 0: Wing Commander SNES, Chuck Rock SNES.

539
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,059
Speaker 1: Rad Final Fantasy Mystic Quest ad.

540
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,479
Speaker 1: Because when Scott mentioned that he saw an ad for it, I imagined in my head what that fucking ad looked like because it was weird and I remembered it.

541
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,419
Speaker 0: It was a big ad campaign in all of the video games.

542
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:57,506
Speaker 1: It was a weird ad campaign because some of these SNES ads from the early 90s were like, "Hey, this is a game you could

543
00:33:57,526 --> 00:33:57,707
Speaker 1: play.".

544
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:03,460
Speaker 1: But a lot of them did this weird, like, the ad almost had nothing to do with the game at all.

545
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,408
Speaker 1: Like, it's a picture of a brain.

546
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:07,352
Speaker 1: Get out of body.

547
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,060
Speaker 1: Brain transplant, $40.

548
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,127
Speaker 1: A tiny print at the bottom.

549
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:13,239
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy Mystic Quest on the SNES.

550
00:34:14,141 --> 00:34:14,322
Speaker 0: Yep.

551
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:21,699
Speaker 0: Also ads for movies, which were basically, when there's an ad for a movie in a comic book, it's basically just the movie poster taking up a full page.

552
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,299
Speaker 0: I saw Aladdin coming soon.

553
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:24,684
Speaker 0: Ooh!

554
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,949
Speaker 0: Disney's Aladdin coming soon.

555
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:29,799
Speaker 0: Candyman coming soon.

556
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,342
Speaker 0: Ooh!

557
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:30,940
Speaker 1: Right?

558
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:32,619
Speaker 1: Those hit me right in the old.

559
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,645
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

560
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,672
Speaker 0: What was the other one?

561
00:34:35,772 --> 00:34:37,060
Speaker 0: Army of Darkness coming soon.

562
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:37,862
Speaker 1: Wow.

563
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,000
Speaker 0: It's like, holy shit.

564
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,179
Speaker 1: I saw all of those in the theater.

565
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,620
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, I don't even know if I saw all of those.

566
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:49,100
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah, the ads were really something.

567
00:34:49,481 --> 00:34:52,600
Speaker 0: And lots of ads for, like, you know, buying comic books, right?

568
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:56,400
Speaker 0: I forgot you could subscribe to comic books, like, directly from Marvel.

569
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,218
Speaker 0: Like, that was a thing.

570
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:00,048
Speaker 0: So yeah, really interesting.

571
00:35:00,088 --> 00:35:02,100
Speaker 0: The ads are really a historic thing going on here.

572
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,860
Speaker 0: Okay, so now let's talk about the comic, right?

573
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:09,420
Speaker 0: So, Spider-Man 2099 is basically, it's far future.

574
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,980
Speaker 0: It's still, it is the Marvel Universe, though.

575
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:21,100
Speaker 0: So there was, like, this, the Marvel Universe is in the past, but clearly something has happened that has, you know, the heroic era ended, right?

576
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:21,367
Speaker 0: Yep.

577
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:25,400
Speaker 0: It's very mysterious, but all the superheroes are dead and/or gone.

578
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,488
Speaker 1: Yeah, with a few caveats.

579
00:35:26,508 --> 00:35:28,220
Speaker 1: Like, Doctor Doom is doing something.

580
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,460
Speaker 0: But is that the, I forget if that's the, I haven't read, I have some Doom 2099, but I haven't read enough to know if that's the original guy.

581
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:42,112
Speaker 1: All I know is whoever is in that Doctor Doom costume is like, "Oh, just as I reemerged, so too does the Spider-Man.

582
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:42,974
Speaker 1: There is no way.

583
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:43,376
Speaker 1: This is a

584
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:44,038
Speaker 1: coincidence.".

585
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,188
Speaker 0: Sure.

586
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,120
Speaker 0: It could be the original Doctor Doom Resurrected.

587
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,320
Speaker 0: It's definitely running Latveria, which still exists somewhere on the map, right?

588
00:35:52,662 --> 00:35:56,540
Speaker 0: But clearly there's, you know, if there's a government, it's not really doing much.

589
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,640
Speaker 0: It's now a very William Gibson-esque cyberpunk dystopia.

590
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:04,820
Speaker 0: There are mega-corporations that sort of really actually run the world.

591
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:10,360
Speaker 0: The police are just, you know, they work for the corporation, right?

592
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,325
Speaker 0: They're corporate cops.

593
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:14,160
Speaker 0: They're not public cops that someone voted for, right?

594
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:16,500
Speaker 0: The company that runs everything is Alchemists.

595
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,660
Speaker 0: If you watched these, you know, what's the Spider-Man movie?

596
00:36:20,883 --> 00:36:21,368
Speaker 0: The good one?

597
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:22,057
Speaker 1: The animated one?

598
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:25,655
Speaker 0: If you watched Into the Spider-Verse, the name of the company is Alchemax.

599
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:26,740
Speaker 0: that came from this comic.

600
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,500
Speaker 1: I assumed it was just Alchemax, like alchemy and chemistry.

601
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,560
Speaker 0: It could be, it could be, oh sure, Alchemax, whatever.

602
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,340
Speaker 0: How you pronounce it, I don't know how you pronounce it.

603
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,520
Speaker 0: But that's where the company came from, right?

604
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:36,959
Speaker 0: That was from this.

605
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,460
Speaker 0: So, yeah, it's corporations run everything.

606
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,127
Speaker 0: There's a cyberspace world.

607
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,720
Speaker 0: You didn't get that far to actually read about the cyberspace brother.

608
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,420
Speaker 1: No, I got up to reading this.

609
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,998
Speaker 1: I got up to when he fights the vulture and deals with him and goes back uptown.

610
00:36:53,301 --> 00:37:01,820
Speaker 0: So there's this jerky dude who is a genius geneticist person who was brought up by the company.

611
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,660
Speaker 0: Like he went to company school, right?

612
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,100
Speaker 0: Because he was gifted, they brought him into the company school.

613
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:08,460
Speaker 0: They taught him everything he knows, right?

614
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,150
Speaker 0: But he's a huge asshole, right?

615
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,520
Speaker 0: He's just an asshole to everyone.

616
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:15,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it starts, he's being an asshole to people who deserve it.

617
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,820
Speaker 1: But then he's also an asshole to like his friends, his fiance.

618
00:37:20,061 --> 00:37:25,540
Speaker 0: His fiance is like the best, awesomest person and he treats her so poorly.

619
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,099
Speaker 0: It's like, why are you, how did you even get with this guy to begin with?

620
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,060
Speaker 0: He treats his brother who's a really nice, you know, if somewhat milk toasty kind of guy.

621
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,420
Speaker 0: You know, but talented and has his own positive traits.

622
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,880
Speaker 1: Dude reminds me of a good looking cereal figgis if any of you have watched Archer.

623
00:37:42,082 --> 00:37:44,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, his name is Miguel O'Hara, right?

624
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,140
Speaker 0: So his mom is Hispanic, his dad is Irish, he didn't get to that part yet.

625
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,665
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did.

626
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:49,518
Speaker 1: That came up right away.

627
00:37:50,345 --> 00:37:50,660
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

628
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,919
Speaker 1: He breaks that up like four times.

629
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,182
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

630
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:56,940
Speaker 0: Because you actually see the mom and dad eventually.

631
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:03,400
Speaker 0: Because in later issues, there's sort of a backup feature that is like young Miguel O'Hara.

632
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,959
Speaker 0: And it shows him in the company school and stuff.

633
00:38:06,402 --> 00:38:08,200
Speaker 0: And you actually see his parents and everything.

634
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:09,979
Speaker 0: We didn't get that far.

635
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:13,420
Speaker 0: So, but yeah, he's this guy and he's just an asshole.

636
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:19,380
Speaker 0: In his mind, when you see what he's thinking, he's not really thinking bad thoughts or doing bad things.

637
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,840
Speaker 0: In fact, one of the first things you see him doing is advocating for not human testing.

638
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,229
Speaker 0: He's got like a genetic device.

639
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,780
Speaker 0: He doesn't want to test it on humans.

640
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,419
Speaker 0: Like he has a high moral standing in terms of what he wants to do.

641
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,260
Speaker 0: It's like you're presented as a good person.

642
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:38,060
Speaker 0: He just is really rude and nasty to everybody.

643
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,080
Speaker 1: Whether they deserve it or not.

644
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,819
Speaker 1: He's rude and nasty to people who deserve it.

645
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:50,460
Speaker 1: And like, it's not spoilers for this old comic book, but like in the first couple issues, like basically what happens is he's like working for this evil company.

646
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:53,280
Speaker 1: They make him do something too evil and it causes someone to die.

647
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,220
Speaker 1: It's a very RoboCop style scene.

648
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,191
Speaker 1: And then he's like, fuck it.

649
00:38:57,271 --> 00:38:57,614
Speaker 1: I quit.

650
00:38:57,815 --> 00:38:58,480
Speaker 1: Fuck you all.

651
00:38:58,622 --> 00:38:59,720
Speaker 1: And he just quits and leaves.

652
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:02,289
Speaker 0: The high moral standing.

653
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:03,860
Speaker 0: actions wise, right?

654
00:39:04,983 --> 00:39:06,800
Speaker 0: But not behavior wise.

655
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:09,799
Speaker 1: It doesn't work out of course, but he tries to quit.

656
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:15,519
Speaker 0: So yeah, obviously he becomes the Spider-Man, right?

657
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:33,640
Speaker 0: The genetics of the original Spider-Man are like in their database and he combines them with his own DNA in order to kick the company guy, the evil company boss guy, sort of gets him addicted to a drug that he will die if he doesn't get it and sort of trap him in the company.

658
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,760
Speaker 0: He tries to kick the drug by modifying his own DNA.

659
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:39,460
Speaker 0: He figures, well, I'm going to die from the drug anyway.

660
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,260
Speaker 0: He's like, if this fails and I die, I'm breaking even.

661
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:52,840
Speaker 0: So he tries it, goes wrong because this other jerk comes into the play and combines his DNA with the original Peter Parker Spider-Man's DNA.

662
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:56,240
Speaker 0: And now he's biologically Spider-Man, right?

663
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:03,359
Speaker 0: His webs come out of his actual, like these glands in his arms or some shit as opposed to Peter Parker who made a web shooter, right?

664
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:08,060
Speaker 0: He climbs with claws that he has to retract, not with stickiness.

665
00:40:09,601 --> 00:40:21,120
Speaker 0: The only thing he has that's not his actual power is he has a costume that, because he's Hispanic, from the Day of the Dead festival, he had a costume made out of, what's it, UMD or something?

666
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, like ultra unstable matter or something.

667
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,419
Speaker 0: Unstable molecules fabric, UMF, I think.

668
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,600
Speaker 0: I don't know, but it's basically fancy material that is bulletproof and everything.

669
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:38,200
Speaker 0: It's really fancy and he has that because he wanted, he owns it because obviously a lot of money.

670
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:43,780
Speaker 0: So he bought it to wear to the festival in case, you know, because the festival is going to get rowdy, right?

671
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,840
Speaker 0: And then he turns that into his Spider-Man costume and now it's armored.

672
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:53,300
Speaker 0: But other than that, all his powers are biological in nature.

673
00:40:54,761 --> 00:41:06,000
Speaker 0: And so yeah, he ends up just by, you know, he's not like even trying to be Spider-Man the way that Peter Parker decided to go out and be Spider-Man after a certain amount of time.

674
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,737
Speaker 0: He's like, "All right, I'm going to go find criminals and stop

675
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:08,878
Speaker 0: them.".

676
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:12,020
Speaker 0: He's just caught in these scenarios, right?

677
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:18,680
Speaker 0: Of people going after him, going after the people he knows and loves and, you know, just bumping into circumstance.

678
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:21,400
Speaker 0: Like he has to do Spider-Man shit.

679
00:41:22,221 --> 00:41:26,040
Speaker 0: And even though his skills are not high, his powers make up for it.

680
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,360
Speaker 0: And he usually wins even against like these trained killers sent to hunt him down, right?

681
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,379
Speaker 0: He's just too strong for them, even though they have much more combat training and such.

682
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,414
Speaker 0: And yeah, other than that, it's his cyberpunk troubles.

683
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,859
Speaker 1: The first many issues are he's just trying to figure out what to do.

684
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,040
Speaker 0: The first three issues are the origin.

685
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:55,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like every time he just almost has a moment to rest, some random superpower jerk-off shows up and tries to fight him.

686
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:57,215
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much.

687
00:42:00,763 --> 00:42:03,860
Speaker 0: There are some issues that are too much fighting, right?

688
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:07,596
Speaker 0: Like he fights the Vulture for most of an issue and it's sort of like, "All right,

689
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:07,857
Speaker 0: dude.".

690
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:12,680
Speaker 0: But all the circumstances, they get a lot done.

691
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,260
Speaker 0: When they're not fighting, there's a lot happening in just a few pages, right?

692
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:29,760
Speaker 0: There'll be like two pages where the boss, Spider-Man's girlfriend, the good one, the fiancé, goes to meet the evil corporate boss, right?

693
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,278
Speaker 0: Stone, Tyler Stone, yeah?

694
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,332
Speaker 0: To sort of ask him, because he's like, "Hey, where's my fiancé?

695
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:37,455
Speaker 0: I haven't seen him in forever.

696
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:38,177
Speaker 0: You're his boss.

697
00:42:38,398 --> 00:42:39,039
Speaker 0: Do you know where he

698
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,280
Speaker 0: is?".

699
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:43,614
Speaker 0: And he shows her all this shit like, "Hey, look, we're terraforming Mars.

700
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:44,738
Speaker 0: We're terraforming under the

701
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:45,019
Speaker 0: sea.".

702
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,717
Speaker 0: He shows her all this stuff and it reveals this whole part of the universe within two pages.

703
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,256
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Whoa, that's a lot of information that really fleshes out this world a

704
00:42:56,337 --> 00:42:56,618
Speaker 0: lot.".

705
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:00,592
Speaker 1: The world is actually moderately complex in an interesting way.

706
00:43:00,672 --> 00:43:02,900
Speaker 1: I enjoyed reading what I read and I'm going to keep reading it.

707
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,140
Speaker 0: It's a really good cyberpunk world because it's not really inventive as far as cyberpunk worlds go.

708
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:14,620
Speaker 0: It came out in the early 90s after other cyberpunk things already existed, right?

709
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,325
Speaker 0: Like when did Neuromancer come out, right?

710
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,449
Speaker 0: Neuromancer.

711
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,536
Speaker 0: No way, it came out after this.

712
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:20,078
Speaker 0: '84, right?

713
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,650
Speaker 0: So it's ten years of cyberpunk or more, right?

714
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:25,497
Speaker 0: At least ten years of cyberpunk stuff.

715
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:26,300
Speaker 0: it's borrowing from.

716
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,390
Speaker 0: But the cops fly around on these bikes, they're 100% Akira.

717
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:31,933
Speaker 0: Peter David is the writer on this.

718
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:42,519
Speaker 1: You go downtown to where the corporations don't give a shit and they basically just hire random thugs to be the cops down there.

719
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,795
Speaker 0: Well, so New York, it takes place in New York/Nueva York, right?

720
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,400
Speaker 0: Which is very fascinating.

721
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,256
Speaker 0: What they've done is the original New York is on the ground, right?

722
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:55,180
Speaker 0: The floor of Earth.

723
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,031
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's downtown in this comic.

724
00:43:57,192 --> 00:43:58,240
Speaker 1: That's literally down.

725
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, downtown isn't south, it's down, right?

726
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:07,160
Speaker 0: They ran out of space and they built New York at some point vertically up.

727
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:07,860
Speaker 1: Jetson style.

728
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:14,455
Speaker 0: It's sort of Jetson style in that it's up, but it's not Jetson style where everything's spread out.

729
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:16,440
Speaker 0: It's compacted and up, right?

730
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,816
Speaker 0: So if you're up in New New York, up above, you're in a flying maglev car, right?

731
00:44:22,836 --> 00:44:24,280
Speaker 0: You're not using the wheels on the car.

732
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:31,192
Speaker 0: You're in a skyscraper because everything is a skyscraper, right?

733
00:44:31,312 --> 00:44:31,973
Speaker 0: There's no dirt.

734
00:44:33,175 --> 00:44:35,520
Speaker 0: If you've got dirt, you've got the dirt from somewhere, right?

735
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,990
Speaker 0: You go to the park, it's not dirt.

736
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,080
Speaker 0: It's like a floating platform of some kind, right?

737
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:56,880
Speaker 0: And then you can pop the wheels out of your maglev car, bop onto a road, drive down a tunnel that goes down and come out into the old New York on the ground where everything sucks and everyone's either unemployed or part of a gang, and it's the warriors down there, right?

738
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:08,000
Speaker 0: And everything up above is cyberpunk dystopia, so it's either the warriors cyberpunk or evil, wealthy cyberpunk people on top, right?

739
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:10,359
Speaker 0: It's kind of a fascinating world.

740
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:27,031
Speaker 1: Especially because it's all layered over this, like, the precursor, like, the people who are reading other Marvel comics have fresh in their minds what was going on in the Marvel comics in the contemporary era, and you see echoes of what was going on in this future era.

741
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:31,540
Speaker 1: Like, there's the people who've worshipped Thor, like, the Thorites wandering around dressing up like Thor.

742
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,130
Speaker 0: Even though the heroic era has ended, clearly it was so impactful, right?

743
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,680
Speaker 0: I mean, if anything from the real Marvel universe was real, that would impact history forever, right?

744
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,322
Speaker 0: And so it does.

745
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:49,360
Speaker 0: So yeah, there's the people who believe in Thor, like, that's their religion, and some of them are fanatical and some of them are sort of normal.

746
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:54,376
Speaker 0: They just believe in Thor the way, like, a normal Christian person would believe in God, you know?

747
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:55,700
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, whatever.

748
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Speaker 0: And then you have, for example, you know, you might not, if you're not, you know, I didn't realize this as a kid, but like, they taught, like, one of the evil cyber companies is Stark Fujikawa.

749
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,420
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, at some point Iron Man's company merged with a Japanese company.

750
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:10,881
Speaker 1: Yup.

751
00:46:11,222 --> 00:46:18,980
Speaker 1: One sour note that does not hold up well is that the first villain he fights is this, like, super fakie Japanese samurai stereotype.

752
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,180
Speaker 0: No, the first villain he fights is Venture.

753
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:21,698
Speaker 1: True.

754
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,346
Speaker 0: The second villain he fights is- Venture's cool.

755
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:26,900
Speaker 0: The Specialist is the second one.

756
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:36,140
Speaker 1: The Specialist is a stereotypical- He is a samurai, screaming, fanatic Japanese with both a samurai sword and nunchucks for some reason.

757
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:36,821
Speaker 0: Right.

758
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:47,880
Speaker 0: It's the typical, you know, racist stereotype depiction of, you know, of Asian-ness, especially Japanese, you know, imagery and aesthetic merged with the cyberpunk stuff.

759
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:59,238
Speaker 0: So it's very in with the times and the style there, but it's, you know, a very, you know, the depiction is like, oh, we have to uphold our honor, right?

760
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:00,440
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, God, really?

761
00:47:03,144 --> 00:47:10,078
Speaker 0: But it's from 1992, so, you know, it doesn't excuse it, but I gotta point it out that it's there, right?

762
00:47:10,138 --> 00:47:11,400
Speaker 0: It doesn't hold up well at all.

763
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:20,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the character is dispatched and it moves on from that pretty quick, but that corporation is still one of the major players, so it's not gonna go away entirely.

764
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,119
Speaker 0: No, that plot definitely comes back into play after a certain point.

765
00:47:26,901 --> 00:47:37,207
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you want to read a Spider-Man story, right, but you don't have to know shit about anything else- Yeah, you don't need to know anything.

766
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:39,220
Speaker 1: If you ever heard of Thor, all right, you're good.

767
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:45,240
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, if you know some stuff about the Marvel Universe, like, it plays in, but not really.

768
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:45,705
Speaker 1: Yup.

769
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,360
Speaker 0: There is a, you didn't get to the crossover, there's a Hammer-Thor-related crossover at some point.

770
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,789
Speaker 1: Oh, Thor shows up?

771
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,020
Speaker 1: How could I have possibly?

772
00:47:56,282 --> 00:48:06,318
Speaker 0: Well, no, there's one issue, the crossover that comes, I forget what it's actually called, it's Hammer-something, it's related to the Thorites, but it's one issue in each of the 2099 comics, right?

773
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:19,940
Speaker 0: So I forget what the order is of that, but it's basically like you would have to stop reading Spider-Man 2099 for a minute and read, like, a Doom issue, a Ravage issue, a Punisher issue, right, to get the whole story together.

774
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:23,320
Speaker 0: It's a very tiny little crossover.

775
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,039
Speaker 1: I can deal with that.

776
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,672
Speaker 0: And after that, it's sort of, I don't think it crossovers again after that.

777
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:30,060
Speaker 0: I think it just keeps going straight.

778
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:37,940
Speaker 0: I don't know if they wrap, you know, I don't think I ever finished all the issues that came out at the time, so I don't know if it ever, like, wraps things up.

779
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:48,700
Speaker 0: But what does happen is over the years, you know, obviously there was a big gap of many years, but they started using Spider-Man 2099 again in other comics, like, he still exists.

780
00:48:50,421 --> 00:49:02,540
Speaker 0: There have been other Marvel comics where he came as a character, like, from another dimension or they went to the 2099 dimension or, you know, I think he was trapped in the regular Marvel universe for some time and then got sent back.

781
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:09,860
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, Miguel O'Hara, the character, he keeps going and he's still a part of Marvel in some ways, right?

782
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:20,140
Speaker 0: But this core story of Spider-Man 2099 is, you know, I don't know if it ends, but it goes and then they don't print any more comics, so it's ending whether you like it or not.

783
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, the dialogue is actually better than the other comics I read from that era.

784
00:49:26,348 --> 00:49:33,560
Speaker 1: Like, it's a little verbose like these kinds of comics tend to be, but the dialogue actually conveys a lot of information.

785
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:37,264
Speaker 0: You don't get the "I hit you, you little guy," right?

786
00:49:37,284 --> 00:49:50,100
Speaker 0: It's like when they're fighting and all the frames and the panels are full of combat, they're actually just talking to each other, like, about, you know, whatever it is that is at issue here, right?

787
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,623
Speaker 0: Usually they're like bargaining, right?

788
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:56,410
Speaker 0: It's like, "Listen, just stop fighting me and, you know, I know what you want.

789
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,772
Speaker 0: This is what I want," right?

790
00:49:57,812 --> 00:49:58,854
Speaker 0: It's like, "Don't kill me.

791
00:49:58,874 --> 00:49:59,475
Speaker 0: What if I kill

792
00:49:59,495 --> 00:49:59,595
Speaker 0: you?".

793
00:49:59,615 --> 00:50:02,020
Speaker 0: You know, that's the kind of conversation they're having.

794
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:11,187
Speaker 0: It's just sort of a big contrast with regular Spider-Man who will have sort of witty, good-natured banter, right?

795
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,169
Speaker 0: And not generally kill people.

796
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:17,773
Speaker 0: Spider-Man 2099 will be an asshole to people and kill them by accident.

797
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:19,655
Speaker 0: Like, he kills people and he's like, "Oh, fuck," right?

798
00:50:19,675 --> 00:50:24,900
Speaker 0: He's like, "Oops," because he's like usually with his claws by accident because he forgets he has them, right?

799
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,848
Speaker 0: It's like he slits a dude's throat with the claws and he's like, "Oh, fuck.

800
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:30,076
Speaker 0: I wasn't trying to do that.

801
00:50:30,618 --> 00:50:30,738
Speaker 0: Oh,

802
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:30,999
Speaker 0: no.".

803
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,739
Speaker 1: He's still learning his powers.

804
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,643
Speaker 0: Yeah.

805
00:50:34,663 --> 00:50:36,852
Speaker 0: Just, you know, just killing people by accident, that's all.

806
00:50:37,193 --> 00:50:38,237
Speaker 0: You know, no big deal.

807
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:38,920
Speaker 0: Just murder.

808
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:46,376
Speaker 1: But it's also got just like a pretty fun and varied cast of characters and I'm honestly pretty into it.

809
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,340
Speaker 1: Like, there's not really much to spoil.

810
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,868
Speaker 0: I grew up on this thing, right?

811
00:50:52,888 --> 00:50:54,370
Speaker 0: Like, I was reading this every month.

812
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:59,660
Speaker 0: This is like my number one thing from like the early 90s for three or four plus years, right?

813
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:10,580
Speaker 0: And that really, you know, looking like I didn't think about it much at the time, like after I, you know, but now that I think about it, it's like, "Oh, that really doesn't form a lot of what I like

814
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:10,660
Speaker 0: now.".

815
00:51:12,521 --> 00:51:18,911
Speaker 0: I like things like this and this was probably the first thing like this that I was into, right?

816
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:24,220
Speaker 0: That probably set my taste, I think, more so than a lot of things.

817
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:28,671
Speaker 0: Oh, one last somewhat unrelated thing.

818
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:31,900
Speaker 0: So, I guess you wouldn't see this either not having read the actual issues.

819
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:51,680
Speaker 0: But in the day, they would always dedicate a page of each comic to the bullpen bulletin, which is sort of like this behind the scenes sort of like you'd get one, there would be a one panel comic, like a far side, but it would be, the main character of it would be the editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, right?

820
00:51:52,121 --> 00:52:03,557
Speaker 0: The top half would be a letter from Stan Lee and the bottom half would be a letter from the editor-in-chief guy, who at the time I think was, was it Tom DeFalco, I guess, maybe?

821
00:52:03,577 --> 00:52:03,998
Speaker 0: I don't know.

822
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:05,380
Speaker 0: I had to look at it again.

823
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,026
Speaker 0: And it was like telling you about what was going on at Marvel Comics, right?

824
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:19,300
Speaker 0: And it sort of was interesting in that even if you were just reading one Marvel comic, by reading this thing, you sort of got this behind the scenes.

825
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:23,930
Speaker 0: They brought you, sort of gave you more of a community feeling, right?

826
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:27,458
Speaker 0: Like, "Hey, Marvel readers, you're in with us, right?

827
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:27,759
Speaker 0: Let us...".

828
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,365
Speaker 0: Because if you didn't have that, you would just be reading the comic.

829
00:52:32,006 --> 00:52:33,729
Speaker 0: As a kid, you're not looking at who the writer is.

830
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:38,137
Speaker 0: I didn't pay attention to who the writer was until late 2000s, right?

831
00:52:38,277 --> 00:52:39,860
Speaker 0: I didn't know Peter David's name before then.

832
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,687
Speaker 0: Now I know exactly who he is, right?

833
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:44,231
Speaker 0: But I didn't know it.

834
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:47,840
Speaker 0: then, even though we wrote all of these issues, pretty much.

835
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:59,693
Speaker 0: And that sort of community building, by having that one page, I think is something that nowadays we have it, but we have it so much that you don't notice it.

836
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:04,660
Speaker 0: Like, someone has a Patreon, it's like you are involved with the creators on everything, right?

837
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:12,152
Speaker 0: It's like no matter what art you're into, like you know who the creators are, you're following them on Twitter, that's sort of like automatic, right?

838
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:16,940
Speaker 0: That you're in that behind the scenes, knowing what the creators are up to community thing.

839
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:27,680
Speaker 0: You don't have this sort of "you're only getting the artwork and the creators are inaccessible and unknown unless they purposefully bring you in" kind of thing.

840
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:30,743
Speaker 0: So that really stood out to me, that bullpen bulletin page.

841
00:53:31,163 --> 00:53:47,280
Speaker 0: And also, just to wrap this up with another feel old, the bullpen bulletin page in the very first issue, Stan Lee's note is basically an advertisement because he's so excited that X-Men cartoon is about to be on Fox.

842
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:51,460
Speaker 1: Oh no, I remember when that premiered.

843
00:53:52,262 --> 00:54:06,520
Speaker 0: Stan Lee's like "X-Men's gonna be on Fox real soon" and I'm so excited that it's not... Yeah, and he's excited because it's actually true to what X-Men is about and isn't, you know, one of those messed up adaptations.

844
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:14,680
Speaker 0: And then in the further issues, like four or five issues in, you start seeing ads for X-Men cartoon VHS tapes.

845
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:22,457
Speaker 0: Because each of these issues is a month apart, so yeah, by the time you're on issue five, you've seen a bunch of episodes, they're weekly, right?

846
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:23,700
Speaker 0: The VHS tapes are coming.

847
00:54:27,266 --> 00:54:28,360
Speaker 0: That dates this comic.

848
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,047
Speaker 1: Yup, and I guess the last thing is the dialogue, it is clear.

849
00:54:33,127 --> 00:54:40,918
Speaker 1: these characters say the word "fuck" specifically a lot and they just translate it to "shock", but the way they use the word "shock" is 100% just "fuck".

850
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:48,032
Speaker 0: Yes, obviously, but I think it gives it sort of like a, they're trying to increase the cyberpunk feel, right, of like.

851
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:51,480
Speaker 0: people have a different language, but they didn't go far enough with it, right?

852
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:57,852
Speaker 0: People still have, like, you know, their 20th century accents from whatever, you know, nationality it was.

853
00:54:57,912 --> 00:55:02,140
Speaker 0: I feel like by 2099, there's gonna be a lot more, you know, a lot less of that, right?

854
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,671
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, what do we sound like compared to people from the, like, 70s?

855
00:55:06,851 --> 00:55:08,335
Speaker 1: Mostly, we just use a lot of new jargon.

856
00:55:08,997 --> 00:55:10,220
Speaker 0: Same swears, for the most part.

857
00:55:11,986 --> 00:55:15,640
Speaker 0: Accents that, like, my parents' generation had, a lot of those are fading already, right?

858
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:18,503
Speaker 1: Yeah, though I did see a thing about how.

859
00:55:18,803 --> 00:55:33,260
Speaker 1: there's a strong argument that the total number of English accents is not changing, it's just that different ones are gaining prominence, and localized, like, they're localized based on interest and internet stuff as opposed to physical location with a few exceptions.

860
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,461
Speaker 0: That's good.

861
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,248
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess we didn't talk about the artwork at all.

862
00:55:36,268 --> 00:55:39,440
Speaker 0: The artwork in this comic is serviceable 90s comic artwork.

863
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:46,840
Speaker 1: Because some parts of it, like, not Mobius quality, but, like, it has this Mobius aesthetic to it, like some of the sci-fi-y stuff.

864
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,100
Speaker 1: But some parts of it are just very comic book punching.

865
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:57,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think what it is, is you can definitely see the effort that, who's the penciler?

866
00:55:57,578 --> 00:55:58,180
Speaker 0: Was it Leonardo?

867
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:06,400
Speaker 1: Oh, they're really trying to make it look good, and look cool, and look different, and they're definitely leaning into the "it is the future, things are weird, for

868
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:06,580
Speaker 1: real.".

869
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:13,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there are some parts where the effort level clearly goes up on the drawing, right?

870
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:24,520
Speaker 0: So it's like, there'll be these really impactful panels suddenly, where, like, you can tell that all the artists, the inker, the color, everyone, just like, that was a big two-page spread, they went hard, right?

871
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:30,853
Speaker 0: And then there'll be a bunch of panels you're flipping through quickly, and you can see that they didn't put as much effort onto those, right?

872
00:56:30,873 --> 00:56:34,060
Speaker 0: They're not as detailed, they're not as attention-grabbing.

873
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:43,778
Speaker 0: And then you'll turn the page, and you'll see one that's amazing, and it looks like Spider-Man 2099 is coming out of the page at you, and staring you right in the face, right?

874
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:44,820
Speaker 0: With something really intense.

875
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,285
Speaker 0: And then the next page is just a lot more sketchy, just, alright, breeze through this, right?

876
00:56:49,705 --> 00:57:05,927
Speaker 0: And it's sort of like, okay, you wanna be disappointed, they didn't put as much effort into all the art, but also, that effort controls the pacing and impact of the story as it goes, 'cause you, okay, flip through, flip through, suddenly don't flip through, right?

877
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:13,140
Speaker 0: Really, you know, this page you're gonna spend some time on, so they'll put better art to sort of keep you on this page longer, right?

878
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:29,660
Speaker 1: But it also serves a good purpose of, it's often a little disorienting about where the characters are in space, but usually, especially during a fight, at least in the issues I read so far, but that almost serves to highlight how disoriented the characters are in terms of what's going on.

879
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,980
Speaker 1: Like, he didn't even know a lot about downtown.

880
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:36,760
Speaker 0: Dude, Spider-Man 2099 is this dude who's been living in the fancy cyberspace.

881
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:48,280
Speaker 1: Imagine someone who was born, went to Google school, worked at Google his whole life, quit Google when they made him kill somebody, and now he's pissed at Google, and has literally, like, never ridden the subway before.

882
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,626
Speaker 0: And his biology has gotten completely fucked up with a bunch of powers, right?

883
00:57:51,987 --> 00:57:59,140
Speaker 0: And it's like, all these, like, first year of this comic, the dude doesn't even get to go back to his apartment for more than five minutes.

884
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:06,852
Speaker 0: And he's getting bounced around all over town by villains, and it's just like, he's on this hell rollercoaster.

885
00:58:06,932 --> 00:58:11,299
Speaker 0: He's a jerk, but he's getting bounced around like this hell rollercoaster of life between different situations.

886
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:17,550
Speaker 0: Like, he can't just, like, you know, take a nap or fucking, you know, stop and eat a sandwich.

887
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:22,580
Speaker 0: Like, he is just, like, everything that's bad is happening to him constantly.

888
00:58:23,181 --> 00:58:25,968
Speaker 0: And, you know, everyone in his life is trying to find him, like, "Where are you?

889
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:27,151
Speaker 0: I've been trying to call you for

890
00:58:27,191 --> 00:58:27,612
Speaker 0: days.".

891
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:30,820
Speaker 0: He's like, you know.

892
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:33,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd say it's pretty worth reading.

893
00:58:34,442 --> 00:58:36,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, no good very bad month.

894
00:58:38,841 --> 00:58:48,182
Speaker 1: So, if you want to scratch a Spider-Man itch, and you also want to scratch a cyberpunk itch, you could do a lot worse than Spider-Man 2099.

895
00:58:48,182 --> 00:58:55,597
Speaker 0: You could also, you know, Peter David, who wrote this, is a really good comic writer, so if you like this, you can look up other comics that Peter David has written.

896
00:58:55,617 --> 00:58:56,860
Speaker 0: He is quite good.

897

908

909
01:00:13,021 --> 01:00:15,240
Speaker 0: Oh, did you get any cool birthday presents?

910
01:00:16,901 --> 01:00:17,285
Speaker 0: Presents?

911
01:00:18,093 --> 01:00:18,820
Speaker 0: Like Christmas presents?

912
01:00:19,622 --> 01:00:22,700
Speaker 0: No, just presents, like stuff you want or stuff you need.

913
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:23,841
Speaker 1: No.

914
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,654
Speaker 0: Why would I get presents on my birthday?

915
01:00:28,577 --> 01:00:29,440
Speaker 0: It's like a Christmas thing.

916
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,020
Speaker 0: So what do you do on your birthday?

917
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,162
Speaker 0: Just usual stuff.

918
01:00:35,063 --> 01:00:36,405
Speaker 0: Have cake.

919
01:00:37,026 --> 01:00:38,048
Speaker 0: We had a big steak dinner.

920
01:00:38,148 --> 01:00:39,790
Speaker 0: That was awesome.

921
01:00:40,431 --> 01:00:41,413
Speaker 1: Have a couple people over.

922
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:42,534
Speaker 1: Yeah.

923
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:46,400
Speaker 0: And you get your birthday tickles, of course.

924
01:00:51,563 --> 01:00:52,007
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

925
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:55,039
Speaker 0: Your... Your birthday tickles.

926
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:55,865
Speaker 0: Yeah.

927
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:00,320
Speaker 0: Tickles on your birthday.

928
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:00,999
Speaker 1: Yeah.

929
01:01:09,162 --> 01:01:10,259
Speaker 0: So you're getting tickled?

930
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,259
Speaker 0: No, why would I get tickled?

931
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,819
Speaker 0: Because you just said birthday tickles.

932
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get to tickle your parents on your birthday.

933
01:01:23,108 --> 01:01:26,740
Speaker 0: So you tickle your... Yeah, like I get to tickle my mom, and then I get to tickle my dad.

934
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,500
Speaker 0: So on their birthdays, you don't buy them a gift?

935
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:36,180
Speaker 0: No, they get birthday tickles, and my dad gets to tickle me and my mom, and my mom gets to tickle me and my dad.

936
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:38,740
Speaker 0: How long are you tickling each other for?

937
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,500
Speaker 0: Just like a standard amount, like 30 to 45 minutes probably.
