1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,450
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, October 10th, 2012.

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,012
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:14,995
Speaker 0: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,840
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,703
Speaker 0: Gravity Falls.

6
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:21,287
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:30,164
Speaker 1: So a friend of ours, Judith, now she is a big fan of Shoujo Kakumei Utena.

8
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:32,234
Speaker 1: I'm very proud that I was the one who convinced her to watch it.

9
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:43,212
Speaker 1: But lately I think she's re-watching it because she keeps tweeting with the hashtag #IkuharaWorld and it is truths from a world that Kunihiko Ikuhara would create.

10
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:54,996
Speaker 1: And considering it's Wednesday, I'd recommend you check out this hashtag because if you're the kind of person who likes Utena or shows like that and you read this stream, you'll find this hilarious.

11
00:00:55,077 --> 00:01:02,367
Speaker 1: But if you're not that kind of person, I'm not even going to kind of read any of these tweets because it will mean literally nothing to you.

12
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:02,427
Speaker 1: No.

13
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:04,916
Speaker 0: OK, so check this out.

14
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:05,518
Speaker 0: I'm checking.

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,432
Speaker 0: When I bought my I bought a new mattress when I moved up here.

16
00:01:08,452 --> 00:01:09,095
Speaker 0: Right.

17
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:12,955
Speaker 0: And I bought that mattress at Sleepy's because, you know, they rip you off, whatever.

18
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:13,940
Speaker 0: It's just a pain in the ass.

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,562
Speaker 0: I don't care.

20
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:18,855
Speaker 1: I've been using the same mattress for like 12 years.

21
00:01:18,936 --> 00:01:19,297
Speaker 0: Yeah.

22
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:20,842
Speaker 0: I expect this mattress to live me.

23
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:22,850
Speaker 0: it last me a fucking long time anyway.

24
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:28,290
Speaker 0: So but when I was at the Sleepy's, they had these pillows and it was so nice.

25
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:29,775
Speaker 0: So very nice pillow.

26
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:31,441
Speaker 0: But they were like 60 bucks.

27
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:32,526
Speaker 0: I was like, fuck you.

28
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:33,893
Speaker 1: It's how much a good pillow costs.

29
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:37,363
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I was so old.

30
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:38,908
Speaker 0: So I went to my.

31
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,801
Speaker 0: I bought regular pillows for like 15 bucks and they lasted me a long time.

32
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:44,368
Speaker 0: But now they're sort of sad.

33
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:48,525
Speaker 0: They have been squished by my head for many years and they're just sort of like food.

34
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:52,302
Speaker 1: So I have a collection of terrible pillows that I give to guests.

35
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,854
Speaker 0: I bought those two like one dollar pillows at Kmart.

36
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:57,505
Speaker 0: Those are in the storage in the couch for the couch bed.

37
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:00,838
Speaker 0: But anyway, but they're barely used.

38
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:01,440
Speaker 0: They're not too bad.

39
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:05,538
Speaker 0: So anyway, so I went to Bed Bath and Beyond to try to get some good pillows.

40
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:11,616
Speaker 0: So I traded all the pillows there and they were all sort of even expensive ones.

41
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:13,745
Speaker 0: I don't like those memory foam ones either.

42
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,757
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, you got to go to a boutique pillow store.

43
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:17,303
Speaker 0: I figure Bed Bath and Beyond.

44
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:18,267
Speaker 0: Bed is the first word.

45
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:20,816
Speaker 1: Gotta focus more on the beyond.

46
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:21,720
Speaker 0: I know, right?

47
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:25,752
Speaker 0: Uh, they had the whole store was disgusting anyway.

48
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,060
Speaker 0: So I try out all the pillows.

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,266
Speaker 0: They all suck memory foam.

50
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:32,422
Speaker 0: I don't like because when memory foam, I sleep on my side a lot, mostly.

51
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:35,756
Speaker 0: So when you sleep on your side, you crush your genitalia.

52
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:37,241
Speaker 1: How on earth do you do that?

53
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:39,730
Speaker 0: My genitalia is not in between the legs.

54
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,473
Speaker 0: It is out in front.

55
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:45,012
Speaker 1: So you like complex straight on your side or you don't like cross over a little bit.

56
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:46,580
Speaker 0: What do you mean crossover?

57
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:50,591
Speaker 1: Like is your waist completely straight or is your back like twisted?

58
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:56,726
Speaker 0: Well, my back is hunched forward in a fetal type position.

59
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:04,810
Speaker 1: Anyway, all I know of you from sleeping at conventions is that you're pretty much all elbows.

60
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,609
Speaker 0: Well, you know, pretty much the thing about sleeping on your side is you think about it.

61
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:15,297
Speaker 0: Your elbow is hitting the bed, which means if you allow your head, if you had no pillow, your head would sort of be like this.

62
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:18,190
Speaker 1: That's why you get one of those pillows that has like a hump.

63
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:25,386
Speaker 0: So, yes, you need enough pillows to cover the distance between the end of your shoulder and the side of your head so that your head points out straight.

64
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:30,848
Speaker 1: Well, you're a freak who claims to want to sleep on ridiculously hard mattresses and pillows anyway.

65
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,177
Speaker 0: So the pillows I have are very squishy.

66
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:41,067
Speaker 0: Now, obviously you don't want to sleep on an actual rock because then there's no give and it's sort of just like your head is on a rock.

67
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:42,052
Speaker 0: It's not comfortable.

68
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:50,262
Speaker 0: What you really want, the ideal pillow for me would be a rock so that it doesn't give but has some sort of jelly surface.

69
00:03:50,282 --> 00:03:52,974
Speaker 0: so it is squishy and comfortable for your head to be on it.

70
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:55,724
Speaker 0: But it does not move away from your head.

71
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:58,112
Speaker 0: My head is still fully 100% supported.

72
00:03:58,132 --> 00:04:12,915
Speaker 1: So why don't you get into the exact position you want on top of some device or some sort of moldable substance, make something in the shape of the correct side of your head with the air and everything, and then get someone to cast that in iron or something.

73
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:14,282
Speaker 0: That'd be sweet, but it'd be cold.

74
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:16,411
Speaker 1: And then cover it in felt, I don't know.

75
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be good.

76
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:25,178
Speaker 0: But anyway, so I went on Amazon, I found the highest rated pillow is the Z-Zoned Talalay Latex Pillow.

77
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:26,883
Speaker 1: You touched my chalalay.

78
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:32,884
Speaker 0: Right, so it comes in four varieties, high loft firm, high loft plush, low loft firm, and low loft plush.

79
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:35,494
Speaker 0: So I got to assume high loft firm.

80
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,905
Speaker 0: That sounds exactly what I'm talking about here, right?

81
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:40,578
Speaker 0: You know, a big springy, you know, latex thing.

82
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:45,119
Speaker 0: Now here is the most important supposed feature of this pillow is it has a bunch of holes in it.

83
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,922
Speaker 0: Look, speed holes.

84
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:47,026
Speaker 0: Look all over the place.

85
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:49,415
Speaker 0: You know why it has those speed holes?

86
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:56,867
Speaker 1: Because it's an overpriced, ridiculous piece of crap the likes of which you would see in one of those Brookstone style stores in the mall.

87
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:02,889
Speaker 0: Maybe, but maybe it's because it supposedly will allow the pillow to always be cold.

88
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,494
Speaker 0: It will never be warm.

89
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:06,561
Speaker 1: I want my pillow to be warm.

90
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:08,367
Speaker 0: Why would I want my pillow to be cold?

91
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:10,011
Speaker 1: Everyone wants a cold pillow.

92
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:13,803
Speaker 1: Cold pillow is the best.

93
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:18,058
Speaker 1: I cover my body in blankets to keep it warm and to keep monsters away.

94
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:26,355
Speaker 0: No, the pillow is cold and you lay on it and then it warms up and you go and you move the pillow to go to the cold section and then that part heats up.

95
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,446
Speaker 0: So then you move the pillow again to go to different cold sections.

96
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:29,493
Speaker 1: No, I lay there until it gets warm.

97
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:30,378
Speaker 1: Then I go, ah.

98
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,760
Speaker 0: See, the listeners are going to comment on this and going to find out that you're the freak.

99
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:38,060
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone is going to comment on our pillow habits, but I order this pillow.

100
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:41,554
Speaker 0: It costs 50 bucks, but it says the list price is 120.

101
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:44,868
Speaker 0: If it doesn't work as advertised, I'm returning that fucker so fast.

102
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,557
Speaker 1: What do you mean work as advertised?

103
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:51,817
Speaker 0: Does it hold your head up if it's not comfortable and if it does not stay cold?

104
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:54,527
Speaker 0: I'm sending it back, but which Amazon doesn't care if you do.

105
00:05:55,309 --> 00:06:02,572
Speaker 0: However, there is one thing about these latex pillows, apparently, is that they supposed to smell not good.

106
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:05,220
Speaker 0: So so what does Amazon say?

107
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,922
Speaker 1: What are the reviews?

108
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,830
Speaker 1: Some of them smell like a butt.

109
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,806
Speaker 0: Some of the reviews say, oh, my God, this thing smells so bad.

110
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:12,651
Speaker 0: I had to send it back.

111
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:16,208
Speaker 0: And some of them say smelled a little bit, but it went away in like a day.

112
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:18,640
Speaker 0: And some of them said, yeah, it smelled a little bit.

113
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,931
Speaker 0: When I put a pillowcase on it, I couldn't say it anymore.

114
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:23,643
Speaker 1: I guess I prefer we show on beds and pillows.

115
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:25,249
Speaker 0: I think we not done that.

116
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:26,374
Speaker 1: I don't think we have.

117
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:27,679
Speaker 1: All right.

118
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,522
Speaker 1: Well, then I'm not going to share my anecdote about what I prefer, because we might do a show on that.

119
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:38,655
Speaker 0: So this weekend, I just want to say, you know, I'm going to come back with a review of this pillow and I just don't want it to be a review out of nowhere.

120
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,265
Speaker 1: This weekend is the New York Comic Con 2012.

121
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:44,193
Speaker 1: We will not be there at all.

122
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:53,043
Speaker 1: I point out I've been to with a free badge every New York Comic Con and New York anime festival since 2007, except the first one.

123
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:58,689
Speaker 1: and this one, the first one I did not go to because it sold out and the fire marshal all but shut it down.

124
00:06:58,809 --> 00:06:58,990
Speaker 0: Yep.

125
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:00,557
Speaker 1: Every one after that I went to.

126
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:01,020
Speaker 1: And you know what?

127
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:06,220
Speaker 1: I hate to say this, but every year there's been less of a reason to go to the next one.

128
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,773
Speaker 1: As of this year, I, I had a press badge for free.

129
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:12,996
Speaker 1: I can get it.

130
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,324
Speaker 1: I had, if I wanted it, a free badge.

131
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:19,935
Speaker 1: I live 20 minutes from the convention.

132
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:20,838
Speaker 0: Well, it's a Javits.

133
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,102
Speaker 0: You got to take a cab or walk.

134
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,587
Speaker 0: It's a, I live on the seven.

135
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:24,811
Speaker 1: I can take it most of the way there.

136
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,356
Speaker 1: Yeah.

137
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:35,062
Speaker 1: I chose not to go and I re I declined the free badge because literally, well one, I looked through the schedule.

138
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:39,739
Speaker 1: There is nothing I care about at the New York Comic Con this year.

139
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,218
Speaker 0: Last year, Makoto Shinkai was there with a screening for the New York anime festival.

140
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:47,969
Speaker 0: That's actually no longer exists at all.

141
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,511
Speaker 1: I know.

142
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:52,466
Speaker 1: Now you go to the New York Comic Con website and it just says New York Comic Con.

143
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:53,028
Speaker 0: Yeah.

144
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:55,859
Speaker 0: Now there is some anime slash manga content there.

145
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:58,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is like a, I think vertical.

146
00:07:58,249 --> 00:07:59,938
Speaker 0: They brought like Miyoko Anno there, right?

147
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:00,782
Speaker 0: And some other people.

148
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:04,235
Speaker 0: So it is not completely devoid of anime, manga stuff.

149
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,365
Speaker 0: I'm sure that many dealers will still be selling things.

150
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,351
Speaker 0: There'll be that Gundam booth.

151
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:08,014
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

152
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:13,657
Speaker 1: The people cared about was the a silly kind of separate anime artist alley ghetto.

153
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:15,725
Speaker 0: I do not think that is going to be there too.

154
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:19,200
Speaker 0: There's one unified artist alley with all the same prices.

155
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:21,909
Speaker 1: and yeah, I looked at the schedule.

156
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:28,129
Speaker 1: It's pretty much nothing but a small number of like special screenings, like big ones, like hall H style stuff.

157
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:28,731
Speaker 0: Fuck that.

158
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:35,211
Speaker 1: Uh, normal screenings, autograph sessions, cost money panels that are clearly paid for by a publisher.

159
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:35,672
Speaker 0: Yep.

160
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:39,866
Speaker 1: And maybe, maybe five or six other panels.

161
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:41,371
Speaker 1: There is nothing there.

162
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:50,465
Speaker 0: So the only reason to go to this is if a, you really, really, really want to go to a giant dealer's room to buy all sorts of comic related shit.

163
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:52,272
Speaker 1: That is not discounted in any way.

164
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:52,653
Speaker 0: No.

165
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:59,845
Speaker 1: Or B, well, there might be a couple of the silver age, gold age, kind of like comic book bins are typical comic comic comic bins.

166
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:07,397
Speaker 0: There are going to be those booths though that have like the $5 trades if you want to stock up on unpopular Marvel titles of the nineties.

167
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:11,920
Speaker 1: But you're not going to find like the dominion tank police DVD box set for 10 bucks like you do at an anime.

168
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,082
Speaker 0: well, I mean sci-fi continuum will probably be there, but they had a pretty weak showing last year.

169
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:16,463
Speaker 0: They did.

170
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:18,049
Speaker 0: They're showing has been decreasing anyway.

171
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:25,800
Speaker 0: Uh, or two, you really, really, really, if you want to pay money to meet a famous person that is going to be there.

172
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,184
Speaker 1: If you want to see Ben Folds.

173
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,930
Speaker 1: five, they're doing a concert.

174
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:29,632
Speaker 0: Great.

175
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:33,126
Speaker 0: Or three, the artist alley will be pretty good.

176
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,384
Speaker 0: It's going to be full of gold people, but it's not worth the price of admission.

177
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,750
Speaker 1: and what's funny.

178
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:46,922
Speaker 1: And you Scott pointed out a tweet on this from one of our friends, but, uh, I realized that no one I know who isn't exhibiting is going this year.

179
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:50,982
Speaker 1: And the people I know who are going, don't live in New York and are traveling for this shit.

180
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:55,868
Speaker 0: Well, because they're traveling because if you don't live in New York, right, you might not even have a comic shop.

181
00:09:55,888 --> 00:10:05,630
Speaker 0: So of course, if you're going to make a trip to go to a comic shop, you're going to go to a super mega temporary ultra comic shop, which is basically what the comic con is true.

182
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,301
Speaker 0: And you're going to go to the one that's closer to you.

183
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:11,610
Speaker 0: So if you're on the East Coast, you're not going to go to San Diego, you're going to go to New York, a hero's con or something like that.

184
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:15,589
Speaker 0: If you live in New York City, you can go to Midtown Comics any day of the week.

185
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:16,955
Speaker 0: So why?

186
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:17,779
Speaker 0: And you can buy stuff.

187
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,368
Speaker 0: I mean, you can buy stuff online no matter where you live.

188
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:20,475
Speaker 0: But why go to New York?

189
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:25,224
Speaker 1: Well, I remember last year was really the last straw because I go, you know, we went every year and I always did some press coverage.

190
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:31,614
Speaker 1: We did one really big episode a long time ago and we used to lecture at the New York Anime Festival extensively on lots of stuff.

191
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:40,731
Speaker 1: We in fact, we ran, I found all these videos other people took of us running those crazy, like five hundred thousand person room match games like four years ago.

192
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:41,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did that once.

193
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,020
Speaker 1: No, we did that twice.

194
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,893
Speaker 1: We had Peter Fernandez as a guest on that one.

195
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,019
Speaker 0: That was the one time we did it.

196
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,804
Speaker 0: The New York Comic Con.

197
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:48,951
Speaker 1: I think we did it twice.

198
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:49,575
Speaker 0: I have two minutes.

199
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,547
Speaker 0: What was the second time we did it in New York Comic Con?

200
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:54,425
Speaker 1: I'll try to dig up my list of panels because I actually don't remember now.

201
00:10:54,526 --> 00:10:56,358
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure we only did it in New York Comic Con once.

202
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:58,269
Speaker 0: We did it at Coscom three times.

203
00:10:58,329 --> 00:10:58,752
Speaker 0: That's true.

204
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:02,352
Speaker 0: But I'm saying New York Comic Con, we did it once and it was one giant room completely full.

205
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:03,821
Speaker 0: Actually, that wasn't even New York Comic Con.

206
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:06,413
Speaker 0: That was New York Anime Festival when it was separate from New York Comic Con.

207
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:17,163
Speaker 0: It's sad how the anime festival kind of just collapsed almost immediately into nothing because they couldn't make because they make all their money on that thing from the fucking exhibit space sales.

208
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:18,247
Speaker 0: What amaze me?

209
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:21,700
Speaker 0: There's no big anime companies to buy giant expensive booths.

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,476
Speaker 1: So three years ago, I said the New York Anime Festival is going to die.

211
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:30,172
Speaker 1: And I got a lot of shit hate mail from people who were like, no, you're wrong.

212
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:30,955
Speaker 1: You're just a hater.

213
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:34,544
Speaker 1: So I hate to be right.

214
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:35,930
Speaker 1: Hate to be right.

215
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:42,082
Speaker 1: In fact, some friends of mine, I was like, well, last year I was like, there's not going to be a separate New York Anime Festival Artist Alley next year.

216
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,988
Speaker 1: I guarantee you that no one believed me.

217
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:45,633
Speaker 1: And yeah.

218
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:46,095
Speaker 1: Yeah.

219
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:58,765
Speaker 1: But what really is kind of sad is that you look at the New York Comic Con website and at the top, it was read pop and it was the Comic Con and some other comics thing and Star Wars Celebration and packs packs, packs, packs, dev.

220
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,434
Speaker 0: And then also isn't up there yet now.

221
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:01,915
Speaker 0: Yeah.

222
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:04,826
Speaker 0: They have a UFC convention and they have some other stuff.

223
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:05,188
Speaker 0: No one cares.

224
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:05,308
Speaker 0: But

225
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:12,862
Speaker 1: the thing is it's like we complain about conventions like Otacon, like the completely fan run conventions because of all the drama and just

226
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:14,228
Speaker 0: unprofessionalism

227
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:20,743
Speaker 1: that we have to deal with, which is not readily apparent to the people who go, but to people who have to deal with them on a professional level, it's just a nightmare.

228
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:31,425
Speaker 1: But at the same time, the super corporate soulless conventions like the New York Comic Con have like the exact opposite problem of I don't want to deal with them because there's.

229
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:34,100
Speaker 1: it's so difficult to deal with them on a whole different level.

230
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:37,130
Speaker 1: It's like I don't even want to go somehow.

231
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,423
Speaker 1: Pax is the only con that balances the two perfectly.

232
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:41,769
Speaker 0: No, mostly perfectly.

233
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,336
Speaker 0: It's better than every other con.

234
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:44,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is no question.

235
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,893
Speaker 0: But to be perfect, it would have to be like, you know, there is not a single even minor complaint that you can make because it is perfect.

236
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:52,758
Speaker 0: And that is not the case.

237
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,030
Speaker 1: I can't think of something I would complain about.

238
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,176
Speaker 1: that's actually the cons.

239
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:57,081
Speaker 1: Well, that's a separate thing.

240
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:57,785
Speaker 0: It could be anything.

241
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:58,208
Speaker 0: that's my.

242
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:03,795
Speaker 0: any minor complaint that you have counts makes it no longer perfect, even one, because perfect means one hundred percent.

243
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,547
Speaker 0: One minor complaint would make it ninety nine point nine percent.

244
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:15,327
Speaker 1: Would it count as a complaint if I saw something that was poorly managed, but it was something I personally did not care about and actually wish it wasn't there in the first place?

245
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,526
Speaker 0: Well, then your minor complaint would be that thing is there in the first place.

246
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:21,042
Speaker 1: Ah, but it was there and failed, which actually covered me pretty well.

247
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:21,585
Speaker 0: Right.

248
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:25,749
Speaker 0: But I mean, it covered you in that you were right that it should not be there, but it was still there.

249
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,860
Speaker 0: So they kind of made a mistake in having it there.

250
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,400
Speaker 1: How about perfection in the sense that as much as is practically possible, it is perfect.

251
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:35,872
Speaker 0: Ah, no, because perfect is, you know, the unattainable.

252
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:40,229
Speaker 0: That's why that's the point of perfect is that you can't be perfect.

253
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:42,216
Speaker 0: That's not perfect.

254
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:42,617
Speaker 0: Perfect.

255
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:44,243
Speaker 0: That's pragmatically perfect.

256
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:48,657
Speaker 0: You're just trying to bullshit so you can use the word perfect.

257
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:51,145
Speaker 0: Just let the semantics go perfectly.

258
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,075
Speaker 1: So not go to the New York Comic Con.

259
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:58,768
Speaker 0: No, just hanging around, getting regular old shit done like cleaning the apartment.

260
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:00,234
Speaker 0: So check this out.

261
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:00,515
Speaker 0: Right.

262
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:03,868
Speaker 0: There is in New York City, well, and a bunch of other cities.

263
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:06,137
Speaker 0: They're going in the United States.

264
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:07,903
Speaker 0: One, two, three, four, five.

265
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:20,984
Speaker 0: They're going to be showing screenings of, I think, the seven the current number seven on the Japanese movie box office, which is the Madoka Magica movie, one part one and two.

266
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:22,952
Speaker 1: I wanted to see that in the theater here.

267
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:24,960
Speaker 1: And in fact, I e-mailed Dave Riley.

268
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,944
Speaker 0: I checked the website.

269
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,057
Speaker 1: Dave, let's all go together and do a show on it.

270
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:30,969
Speaker 1: And then he was like, I think it's sold out.

271
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:34,521
Speaker 0: Yeah, I checked the website a few times and it wasn't on sale yet.

272
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:36,111
Speaker 0: And then I checked it and it was on sale.

273
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:38,223
Speaker 0: But when I tried to actually buy the tickets, it didn't load.

274
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:38,966
Speaker 0: It's an error.

275
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:42,020
Speaker 0: I came back the next day and it wasn't there anymore.

276
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:44,671
Speaker 0: So I think it sold out and it was one screening in the city.

277
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:46,197
Speaker 0: And what other cities?

278
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:47,704
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they all sold out.

279
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:49,671
Speaker 0: Oh, they have a bunch in L.A.

280
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:50,575
Speaker 0: more than anywhere else.

281
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:53,447
Speaker 0: But Chicago, Houston, San Francisco were the other.

282
00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:01,420
Speaker 1: thing is I feel like this is really only a movie for someone like me who's already seen the show and just wants to re experience the show.

283
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,384
Speaker 1: There's nothing different.

284
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:03,370
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I went.

285
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,064
Speaker 0: I looked up what the movie actually is from someone who saw it.

286
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:07,452
Speaker 0: And this is what the Madoka movie is.

287
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:08,055
Speaker 0: There's two of them.

288
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:10,566
Speaker 0: And basically each one is half the show.

289
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:14,238
Speaker 0: And they pretty much take the show end to end.

290
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:21,748
Speaker 0: And, you know, I think there's some sort of increase in resolution, you know, display video quality somewhere that there was no noticeable difference.

291
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:22,110
Speaker 1: Yeah.

292
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,769
Speaker 0: There's maybe like 30 seconds of added footage and they cut out a lot of stuff like that.

293
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:29,723
Speaker 1: I read the same review and actually take issue with the review.

294
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:31,651
Speaker 0: Well, how do you know you haven't seen the movie?

295
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:44,384
Speaker 1: Because what was pointed out as a strength was that it removes some of the repetitive like set building of the show, like how they keep bringing up what will you wish for and those sorts of things over and over again.

296
00:15:44,404 --> 00:15:48,502
Speaker 1: I feel like that repetition is actually very important to what the show is doing.

297
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:48,844
Speaker 0: Yeah.

298
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:56,296
Speaker 1: But I mean, they said that the fact that that wasn't there was a like a something better about the movie compared to the show just seemed like a.

299
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:06,263
Speaker 0: well, I guess what it would be is that if you're watching one episode at a time with breaks in between, you know, there are more reminders usually necessary for, you know, purpose for purposes like that.

300
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:08,055
Speaker 0: And when you have a movie, you're watching on one shot.

301
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:13,579
Speaker 0: Well, you might not need as many reminders of certain things constantly and they would disturb the pacing.

302
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:21,588
Speaker 1: While you could say that, my rationale on paper said requires one to have seen the entire show or else I'll spoil it for everybody.

303
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:22,231
Speaker 1: Yeah.

304
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,280
Speaker 1: So anyway, is it to say, I think I am correct.

305
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:33,812
Speaker 0: that same review also said that the running time of like the first six at first half of the show is like 30 minutes longer than this movie.

306
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:34,635
Speaker 0: Right.

307
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:39,453
Speaker 0: If you remove the openers and the closers in the right way, you remove the openers and the closers.

308
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:42,846
Speaker 1: That's like one of an anime screening.

309
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:44,995
Speaker 1: You got to watch every bad damn opener and closer.

310
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:51,636
Speaker 1: This is a so in English and then in Romangi and then in actual Japanese text and then.

311
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:52,318
Speaker 1: Sure.

312
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:52,960
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,513
Speaker 0: for convenience sake, if you don't want to sit there and watch 13 episodes of Madoka, you can watch the two movies and it's pretty much the same goddamn thing.

314
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:01,236
Speaker 0: 90 percent.

315
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:02,080
Speaker 0: So.

316
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,349
Speaker 0: But I mean, it'd just be cool to watch it in the theater.

317
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,234
Speaker 0: I would like to go.

318
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:05,335
Speaker 1: Yeah.

319
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:09,714
Speaker 0: It doesn't hurt to watch Madoka again or again, again or again, again, again.

320
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:17,521
Speaker 1: We've seen Madoka twice, four times, but I've seen the first eight episodes in about a fifth time for five times.

321
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,445
Speaker 0: Thinking about a fifth time.

322
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:26,012
Speaker 1: Thing is, I'm rewatching Cowboy Bebop right now and I just watched with Emily the last episode before the shit goes down.

323
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:31,391
Speaker 0: That's the if I remember correctly, the skyscraper episode.

324
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:31,973
Speaker 1: No, there's.

325
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:33,357
Speaker 1: I thought that too.

326
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:35,646
Speaker 1: There's one episode that happens after that.

327
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:36,811
Speaker 0: What episode is that?

328
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:40,265
Speaker 1: With the the ghost in the shelly kind of computer cult.

329
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,293
Speaker 0: Don't remember that one.

330
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:42,654
Speaker 0: Really?

331
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:43,859
Speaker 0: I had to remember.

332
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:54,202
Speaker 1: Remember the scene where spikes walk in and he's in a room full of computer monitors and there's someone yelling at him from all the computer monitors and they is pass out and Ed dresses up like a girl.

333
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:57,292
Speaker 0: Vaguely, I'm going to go rewatch.

334
00:17:57,754 --> 00:17:58,195
Speaker 1: You know what?

335
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:00,343
Speaker 1: Rewatching Cowboy Bebop again did one thing.

336
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:01,107
Speaker 1: Can't go wrong.

337
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:02,435
Speaker 0: It's again, again, again, again, again.

338
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:05,967
Speaker 1: It ruined my desire to watch 99 percent of the anime that's coming out.

339
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,071
Speaker 0: Anyway, whatever.

340
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:20,048
Speaker 0: Let us move forward onward into things of the day.

341
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:24,260
Speaker 1: So you all know that I am a incredible fan of hockey.

342
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:32,497
Speaker 1: I'm not going to talk about the fact that there's not going to be hockey this year because I might cry, but it's OK because the Russians are coming to play hockey in New York.

343
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:33,805
Speaker 0: Supposedly they still haven't.

344
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:34,610
Speaker 0: It's like this weird.

345
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,539
Speaker 0: you read these articles that are a few months old that say it's going to happen, but I can't find tickets or schedules or anything.

346
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,354
Speaker 1: So if that happens, I am going to see it no matter.

347
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,148
Speaker 1: It would have to cost like a thousand dollars for me to not go see this hockey game yet.

348
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:48,591
Speaker 0: But yet.

349
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:54,014
Speaker 0: So just so people know, the Continental Hockey League, which begins with K is the Russian Hockey League.

350
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:55,520
Speaker 0: It has Schley Valk.

351
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,966
Speaker 0: It has.

352
00:18:57,026 --> 00:18:57,187
Speaker 0: Yeah.

353
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:58,413
Speaker 0: You don't even know what that means.

354
00:18:58,635 --> 00:18:59,640
Speaker 0: Or if you're pronouncing it right.

355
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:00,785
Speaker 1: No idea.

356
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:04,222
Speaker 1: Bunch of drunk Russian men yelled it repeatedly during a hockey game when I was a little kid.

357
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:04,543
Speaker 1: Right.

358
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:11,513
Speaker 0: So but that is supposedly the premier hockey league in the world now because there is the best NHL players have gone there.

359
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:14,143
Speaker 0: I think Evgeny Malkin's playing there with some other people.

360
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:16,831
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, there you go.

361
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:21,006
Speaker 1: So this is a video and an article about hockey.

362
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:22,594
Speaker 1: But this is not just modern hockey.

363
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,201
Speaker 1: This is hockey from nineteen sixty seven.

364
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:27,751
Speaker 1: Hockey is a lot, if I may.

365
00:19:28,874 --> 00:19:31,741
Speaker 1: And the things that have changed are not what you would expect.

366
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,688
Speaker 0: Hockey or ice stick puck, if you will.

367
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:38,436
Speaker 1: Golly, that very nice.

368
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:40,662
Speaker 1: So hockey's changed a lot.

369
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:42,369
Speaker 1: But the thing is, it's changed in weird ways.

370
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:44,176
Speaker 1: It wasn't that long ago.

371
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,802
Speaker 1: Nobody wore helmets.

372
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:50,259
Speaker 1: I saw hockey games in my lifetime with people not wearing helmets.

373
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,202
Speaker 0: Well, there was a time in my life for the Institute to rule that was like every new player has to wear a helmet.

374
00:19:55,303 --> 00:20:01,629
Speaker 0: But anyone who was in the league before the helmet rule was instantiated is allowed to continue to not wear a helmet.

375
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:08,479
Speaker 0: And now, of course, there's nobody still in the NHL old enough to be grandfathered in and allowed to be wearing no helmets.

376
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:17,996
Speaker 0: But in my lifetime, I have seen a handful of hockey players in live hockey games in my lifetime not wearing any helmet because they were grandfathered in for the helmet rule.

377
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:18,880
Speaker 1: That seems obvious.

378
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:19,402
Speaker 1: No one.

379
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:20,386
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty seven.

380
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:25,686
Speaker 1: The goalies didn't have to wear face masks if they didn't want to or anything.

381
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:29,941
Speaker 1: So if you look at this article, you might notice notice that there's a goalie.

382
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,429
Speaker 1: He kind of looks like Frankenstein.

383
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,033
Speaker 0: So he is.

384
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:36,179
Speaker 1: he basically is Frankenstein.

385
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,261
Speaker 1: This goalie who played for the Red Wings a long time ago, Terry Sawchuk, he played for every team.

386
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:42,166
Speaker 0: Apparently is all six of them.

387
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:47,642
Speaker 1: He has an uncountable number of scars on his face for being a man.

388
00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:56,443
Speaker 1: Count them one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, a lot in ten.

389
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:57,005
Speaker 0: Lots.

390
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:58,369
Speaker 0: I think he's three on the chin.

391
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,470
Speaker 0: Yeah.

392
00:20:59,694 --> 00:21:00,517
Speaker 0: But what about this?

393
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:06,698
Speaker 1: How about to him in a hockey game that looks like it cut their shoulders and knees and toes?

394
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:08,584
Speaker 0: Knees and he is fucked the fuck up.

395
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:17,160
Speaker 1: So to make a long story short, this article talks about all the things that were different about hockey that back then and all the things that are the same.

396
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:18,807
Speaker 1: And it's actually really fascinating.

397
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:30,177
Speaker 1: A lot of people have this weird sort of idea that hockey was super different back then, just because most of the footage of it that you can see today is far away and blurry and seems just really kind of slow and stupid.

398
00:21:30,197 --> 00:21:31,762
Speaker 0: That's the camera's fault.

399
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:32,244
Speaker 1: Yeah.

400
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:36,437
Speaker 1: So this is footage like from modern hockey, just of 1967 hockey.

401
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,267
Speaker 0: But did you see there was a controversy?

402
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:40,915
Speaker 0: This is a similar controversy.

403
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:44,652
Speaker 0: Robert Johnson is pretty much the inventor of blues music.

404
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:46,922
Speaker 0: You know, the guy who went down to the crossroads and such.

405
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:48,027
Speaker 0: Right.

406
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:55,062
Speaker 0: And there were serious discussions going on of, you know, there's the Robert Johnson tapes, which is pretty much like, you know, the foundation of all blues music.

407
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:55,544
Speaker 0: You listen to it.

408
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:55,705
Speaker 0: Right.

409
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:56,771
Speaker 0: The only recordings of him.

410
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,113
Speaker 0: Yeah.

411
00:21:57,555 --> 00:22:02,674
Speaker 0: And there's controversy of are those tapes sped up or maybe they're actually to like?

412
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:04,822
Speaker 0: are the one the songs that you hear?

413
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:12,971
Speaker 0: if you go type in Robert Johnson on Amazon or Spotify or Scott, those are those the wrong speed because of the way it was recorded.

414
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:15,801
Speaker 0: That's that is a serious matter of debate.

415
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:19,834
Speaker 1: Scott, you think that that is a new thing?

416
00:22:20,476 --> 00:22:22,001
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it's similar to the hockey.

417
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,503
Speaker 1: No, no.

418
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:23,749
Speaker 1: So I'm going to tell you there's.

419
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:24,874
Speaker 1: there is a problem.

420
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:30,658
Speaker 1: There's a lot of different terms for this, but basically how we tune orchestras has changed over the years.

421
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:40,046
Speaker 1: And the classical music people argue as to what pitches should actually sound like is a 440 is a 444.

422
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:40,747
Speaker 1: Nobody knows.

423
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:42,693
Speaker 0: Ford hurts matters.

424
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:43,816
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

425
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:44,718
Speaker 0: It matters.

426
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,083
Speaker 0: You can hear the difference.

427
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:47,428
Speaker 0: I mean, come on.

428
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:48,955
Speaker 0: You wouldn't know who you win a prize.

429
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:49,698
Speaker 0: Golden year.

430
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:53,915
Speaker 1: In fact, here's an entire article I'm showing you right now on pitch inflation.

431
00:22:54,618 --> 00:23:00,599
Speaker 0: Maybe this is a whole topic of like, you know, lost history due to technological something something.

432
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,163
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.

433
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:10,711
Speaker 1: In 1834, the Stuttgart Conference recommended C to 64, also known as the A being four hundred and forty hertz as the standard pitch.

434
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:12,399
Speaker 0: So this is why it's good.

435
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,463
Speaker 0: Everything now is digital.

436
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:14,790
Speaker 0: It's zero or it's one.

437
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,814
Speaker 0: And there's no ambiguity.

438
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:16,799
Speaker 0: Analog assholes.

439
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,221
Speaker 0: All right.

440
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:17,642
Speaker 0: All right.

441
00:23:17,682 --> 00:23:20,131
Speaker 1: So I'm going to record my audio at one bid per second.

442
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:20,572
Speaker 0: Nice.

443
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:20,633
Speaker 0: OK.

444
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,271
Speaker 1: This video is amazing, even if you don't like hockey.

445
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:24,855
Speaker 0: All right.

446
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:26,887
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is actually comics related, right?

447
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:31,808
Speaker 0: There is apparently I did not know this because I haven't read newspaper comic strips in a long time.

448
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:39,617
Speaker 0: There is a newspaper comic strip called Close to Home by written by a person and drawn by a person named John McPherson.

449
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:40,018
Speaker 0: Right.

450
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:40,480
Speaker 0: McPherson.

451
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:48,207
Speaker 0: And it is basically a really crappy sort of far side situation with the one panel with the text underneath and an illustration.

452
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:53,666
Speaker 0: Right now, this guy who has a blog here, his name is Tom Popolardo.

453
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:59,183
Speaker 0: He is a graphic designer, illustrator, animator, you know, typical cool person.

454
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:07,427
Speaker 0: And he is much, much smarter about graphic design and comic making than John McPherson.

455
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:14,131
Speaker 0: Now, what he did is he basically would keep reading this comic strip every day, not because he liked it, but because he hated it.

456
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:15,817
Speaker 0: It was so bad.

457
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:16,480
Speaker 0: It was awful.

458
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,069
Speaker 0: The composition especially was just horrendous.

459
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,936
Speaker 0: And the jokes were not funny.

460
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:23,307
Speaker 0: And it was like the word it pissed him off so much.

461
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:28,571
Speaker 0: He would collect the worst examples of this comic strip over time until eventually one.

462
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:32,709
Speaker 0: And he was like, one day I'll write a blog post about how awful this comic strip is with all these examples.

463
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,410
Speaker 0: And so one day one of them was so bad that he ended up writing the blog post.

464
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:43,173
Speaker 0: And here is that blog post with all these examples of these really, really bad comics.

465
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:49,275
Speaker 0: And he points out to you what's so bad about them and how the drawings are just awful and the jokes aren't funny.

466
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:53,446
Speaker 0: I think the line that he said, where is it?

467
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:58,797
Speaker 1: Was that the no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

468
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:06,347
Speaker 0: OK, because it is so poorly executed, I usually spend more time trying to comprehend what I'm looking at than I do not laughing at the punch line.

469
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,296
Speaker 0: And I'm reading the comics.

470
00:25:09,597 --> 00:25:11,603
Speaker 0: You completely agree with that sentence.

471
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:16,497
Speaker 0: And the worst thing is that he uses all these examples.

472
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:16,818
Speaker 0: Right.

473
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,259
Speaker 0: This guy who writes a daily newspaper strip has reused the same jokes on different days.

474
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,882
Speaker 0: Like he'll write it.

475
00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:24,586
Speaker 0: He'll write a thing.

476
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,702
Speaker 0: And then two years later, he'll do the same exact comic again.

477
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:28,788
Speaker 0: He'll just draw the same thing.

478
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,626
Speaker 1: Scott, I submit that there is, in fact, one comic that does that every day.

479
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:34,936
Speaker 1: that has had only one joke in his entire history.

480
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:38,390
Speaker 0: Garfield has three jokes as lasagna kicking off the table.

481
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:39,735
Speaker 0: And John's a loser.

482
00:25:39,935 --> 00:25:41,862
Speaker 1: The Lockhorns has exactly one joke.

483
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:43,327
Speaker 0: I hit my wife.

484
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:43,968
Speaker 0: I hit my wife.

485
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,255
Speaker 1: I hate my significant other.

486
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:52,517
Speaker 0: Well, and not enough, but not in at least Andy Capp has the say that joke and the I'm drunk joke.

487
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:53,581
Speaker 1: Also, I'm poor.

488
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:56,231
Speaker 1: He is poor and drunk and he hates his wife.

489
00:25:56,652 --> 00:25:57,254
Speaker 0: Three jokes.

490
00:25:57,716 --> 00:25:59,724
Speaker 0: Same as Garfield, the three joke standard.

491
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,154
Speaker 1: But the Lockhorns literally it is just.

492
00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:04,344
Speaker 1: I hate my significant other, but not enough to divorce.

493
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:06,053
Speaker 0: Well, Marvin Duke also has one joke.

494
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:06,576
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

495
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:07,299
Speaker 0: That dog is big.

496
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:12,183
Speaker 1: Or Kathy.

497
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:13,989
Speaker 1: I can't believe there are people who read this.

498
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:20,835
Speaker 0: But anyway, no, this comic you just made a whole fun of a whole bunch of crappy newspaper comics.

499
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:21,940
Speaker 0: You read this.

500
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,560
Speaker 0: You don't even need to read this blog post to know that these are the worst blog posts.

501
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,239
Speaker 0: Yes, you don't need to read this blog post to know that this comic is the worst.

502
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,266
Speaker 0: The comic stands out as the worst all on its own.

503
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:46,563
Speaker 0: But when you do, you need the blog post so that you can tolerate reading the comic strips because the comments in the blog, you know, along with the awful comic make it, you know, entertaining as opposed to making you want to hurt yourself.

504
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:47,590
Speaker 1: You know what that's analogous to?

505
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:50,486
Speaker 1: It's like watching an angry video game nerd about a bad guy.

506
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:51,932
Speaker 0: That is exactly what this is.

507
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:53,680
Speaker 0: This is the angry comic strip nerd.

508
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,502
Speaker 1: But with the Egoraptor tilt, because while, you know, the angry video game nerd, I love James Rolfe.

509
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:04,267
Speaker 1: But when he talked about how bad Castlevania two was, he he made fun of it, but didn't really analyze it.

510
00:27:04,307 --> 00:27:08,126
Speaker 0: But then you're just going on that one because you are a Castlevania two fan.

511
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:11,120
Speaker 1: Now, I understand how Egoraptor also said it was a shitty game.

512
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,152
Speaker 1: He just made a much better argument as to why it's shitty.

513
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:14,835
Speaker 0: Yeah.

514
00:27:15,056 --> 00:27:19,392
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I realized that angry video game nerd, you know, he pays the bills with poop jokes.

515
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:24,473
Speaker 0: So he's not exactly going to go for eloquence to go along with this guy.

516
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:29,152
Speaker 1: That's because he, like all men who should be men, lives like a wind rammer as he fucks.

517
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,096
Speaker 0: And it's true.

518
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:31,923
Speaker 0: That should have been the thing of the day.

519
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:32,607
Speaker 0: Maybe it will be.

520
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:34,094
Speaker 1: It was the thing of the newsletter.

521
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,829
Speaker 1: So I guess that's a Segway for the meta moment.

522
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:38,933
Speaker 0: We have a newsletter.

523
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:41,563
Speaker 0: Apparently, it's much more popular than I thought.

524
00:27:41,724 --> 00:27:42,005
Speaker 1: Yeah.

525
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:44,254
Speaker 1: Scott had an apology for all you for.

526
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:44,454
Speaker 1: Yeah.

527
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:44,876
Speaker 1: OK.

528
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:49,115
Speaker 1: For the one person in the world who actually has their email set to be text only.

529
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:50,381
Speaker 0: Well, OK, so here's how it is.

530
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:50,622
Speaker 0: Right.

531
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:54,940
Speaker 0: So the newsletter has like one hundred and twenty something subscribers.

532
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,823
Speaker 0: Just not bad.

533
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:58,032
Speaker 0: And and a lot of people seem to like it.

534
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:01,227
Speaker 1: And people are already like, hey, how can I get the back issues?

535
00:28:01,488 --> 00:28:03,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess our super hardcore crazy fans.

536
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:07,153
Speaker 0: And the way you get the back issues is find someone who got them to forward them to you.

537
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:12,433
Speaker 0: Number two, I suck at MailChimp and I'm still figuring it out.

538
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:14,623
Speaker 0: So here are two mistakes that I have made so far.

539
00:28:14,703 --> 00:28:16,510
Speaker 0: Mistake number one, a very small mistake.

540
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,940
Speaker 0: The last newsletter was number five.

541
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:20,992
Speaker 0: And the one before that was also number five.

542
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:23,567
Speaker 0: I'm going to make the next one number seven just just to get it back.

543
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:24,030
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

544
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:24,755
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, Scott.

545
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:26,462
Speaker 1: You know, you know what's calling for you now?

546
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:27,906
Speaker 1: Ruda Khan.

547
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:28,226
Speaker 0: Why?

548
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:32,717
Speaker 0: I don't think there's.

549
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,586
Speaker 1: there are many people left alive who I'm referring to.

550
00:28:35,787 --> 00:28:35,947
Speaker 0: OK, so.

551
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:38,277
Speaker 0: and number two, a much more grievous error.

552
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:44,926
Speaker 0: When you subscribe to newsletter and MailChimp, you can choose text only or HTML emails, which is a choice you should be able to make.

553
00:28:44,986 --> 00:28:49,290
Speaker 0: Right now, as an aside, especially if you want to read the newsletter in mutt, you don't want the HTML email.

554
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,852
Speaker 0: It's unreadable.

555
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:53,626
Speaker 1: There is no there's no reason to use mutt anymore.

556
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:54,650
Speaker 0: But it's good.

557
00:28:55,473 --> 00:29:06,731
Speaker 1: OK, so dude, when I get a text email from someone from a corporation that still has their like corporate mandated signature at the bottom, but because it's not HTML, it's all just like text anyway.

558
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,003
Speaker 0: So I made a mistake in MailChimp.

559
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:19,903
Speaker 0: What I was doing to send out the newsletter is I would basically just copy the previous newsletter, go in and edit it and then send it and change the number from, you know,

560
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:25,468
Speaker 1: I feel a little bit vindicated that I'm not the only person who does that when I'm writing like an article or something.

561
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:26,192
Speaker 0: What else would I do?

562
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:30,048
Speaker 0: The thing is, in MailChimp, I was editing the HTML version.

563
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:37,359
Speaker 0: I assume that the text version would sort of inherit the changes because the very first newsletter I sent out, it generated the text version.

564
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:38,886
Speaker 1: Scott, you're a developer.

565
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:40,674
Speaker 1: You know better than to assume.

566
00:29:40,694 --> 00:29:44,309
Speaker 0: But MailChimp is actually really well done and has a really good UI.

567
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:54,889
Speaker 0: I assumed that when you, you know, the first time I wrote a newsletter on there, the the text generate text version was automatically generated from the HTML version.

568
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,742
Speaker 0: So I was like, oh, I don't have to actually rewrite the text version.

569
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,490
Speaker 0: I just wrote the HTML one.

570
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,423
Speaker 0: I assumed that even looking to the text one would be updated.

571
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:02,946
Speaker 0: And I would even.

572
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:08,154
Speaker 0: every time I wrote a newsletter, I would send a test email to myself, go to Gmail and look at it and to verify it.

573
00:30:08,194 --> 00:30:10,946
Speaker 0: And it was always correct because it was the HTML version.

574
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:19,720
Speaker 0: So the thing is, anyone who's subscribed to the text version, you actually got the same exact newsletter six times and it was never updated.

575
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,820
Speaker 0: It's just been newsletter number one every single time with no changes.

576
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:25,488
Speaker 0: So I apologize to all you.

577
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:31,460
Speaker 0: one persons who subscribe to the text version, doesn't have HTML email like a modern Gmail person.

578
00:30:32,502 --> 00:30:37,802
Speaker 0: I will correct that for all future newsletter mailings, and that will never be a problem again.

579
00:30:39,366 --> 00:30:47,900
Speaker 1: So a few minutes ago, I uploaded the third of our three mini lectures from PAX Prime 2012 on the ethics of mind control.

580
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:56,500
Speaker 1: I think that actually is the last of all the videos I have from PAX Prime so I can delete that like one hundred and eighty gigabyte project from my hard drive.

581
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,763
Speaker 0: All right.

582
00:30:57,984 --> 00:31:05,140
Speaker 0: Another thing we have started in our efforts to expand and have geek nights in every possible Internet protocol that exists.

583
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:14,780
Speaker 0: We have added an IRC channel and I think, you know, in previous times people have tried to start many unofficial ones and they did not stick very well.

584
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:16,360
Speaker 0: So I was very unconfident in them.

585
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:23,787
Speaker 0: I also thought it may, you know, sort of be, I guess, redundant with having a forum, having an IRC.

586
00:31:23,827 --> 00:31:25,160
Speaker 0: It's like, what's the point of having both?

587
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:28,339
Speaker 0: You know, what purpose does IRC serve that the forum does not serve?

588
00:31:29,382 --> 00:31:33,020
Speaker 0: But whatever, if people want to be on IRC, why not put it there?

589
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,058
Speaker 0: It doesn't cost anything.

590
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,420
Speaker 0: So, Geek Nights IRC now exists.

591
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:39,279
Speaker 1: Someone said back.

592
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:39,921
Speaker 0: Yeah.

593
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:45,860
Speaker 0: Point your clients at IRC.funetic.net and connect to pound symbol Geek Nights.

594
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,500
Speaker 1: Also, one of our listeners already made a bot that if you type Ubuntu, it just says Ubuntu.

595
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,500
Speaker 0: It's going to be the Geek Nights front row crew inside joke bot.

596
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:56,208
Speaker 0: There's also logs of.

597
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:59,640
Speaker 0: that was the real thing is I wanted to have if I was going to do an IRC, I don't like to lose anything.

598
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,001
Speaker 0: So I've been.

599
00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:03,499
Speaker 0: I've logged the entire history of the channel and will continue to do so.

600
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,429
Speaker 0: You can go to the front row crew.com/irc/logs and read the logs.

601
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,830
Speaker 1: What's the logic of that?

602
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:10,620
Speaker 1: Like, when does it refresh?

603
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,622
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

604
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:14,780
Speaker 1: Because if I go there, it usually only shows me like one like nothing.

605
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:16,009
Speaker 0: Go to front row crew.

606
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:16,960
Speaker 0: Now click on Geek Nights.

607
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,171
Speaker 1: Oh, I have to click on that.

608
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:18,739
Speaker 0: Now click on it.

609
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,720
Speaker 0: Ah, I have to click on something.

610
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,122
Speaker 1: What?

611
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:23,979
Speaker 1: Oh, look at all these people talking to you.

612
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:25,582
Speaker 0: That's it.

613
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:27,589
Speaker 0: It's basically the way the bot works.

614
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:31,863
Speaker 0: is it's just there's a. it's a user in the IRC channel.

615
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:37,764
Speaker 1: And any time you say something, I have not idled on an IRC channel in almost 15 years.

616
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:42,564
Speaker 0: It writes down whatever you say into an HTML file that other people can read on the website.

617
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,900
Speaker 0: And every day it rotates to a new file.

618
00:32:45,642 --> 00:32:46,490
Speaker 0: That's all there is to it.

619
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:47,680
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of people.

620
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,920
Speaker 1: I guess I should in the tradition of how IRC is used, I should log in with Perch or Merc.

621
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:55,400
Speaker 0: You want to use IRSSI, everybody.

622
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,560
Speaker 1: Real men use Perch or Merc.

623
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,024
Speaker 1: No.

624
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:57,448
Speaker 0: Yeah.

625
00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:00,121
Speaker 0: If the year is 1999.

626
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:04,563
Speaker 1: But I think the purpose of IRC is just to idle for as long as possible without saying anything.

627
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:06,760
Speaker 0: I'm using screen running on a line.

628
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,480
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm always in there.

629
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,468
Speaker 0: It never leaves it.

630
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:10,839
Speaker 0: I'm just permanently in there.

631
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:11,722
Speaker 1: Watch out.

632
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:16,808
Speaker 1: You're going to accidentally hit control D instead or instead of control, whatever D.

633
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,720
Speaker 0: I did that the other day.

634
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,169
Speaker 0: It's fine.

635
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:18,658
Speaker 1: Yeah.

636
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:23,340
Speaker 1: I realize that most people cannot wrap their heads around screen.

637
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,358
Speaker 0: They should use TMUX then.

638
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, but screens what they got.

639
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,159
Speaker 0: Well, the TMUX is also free.

640
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, but screen is what's already installed on the Red Hat server.

641
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:35,699
Speaker 0: Control A, what else do you have to know?

642
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,740
Speaker 1: That's quite a leap for some people.

643
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,518
Speaker 0: Pressing control and A at the same time.

644
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,719
Speaker 0: And then after letting go, pressing something else.

645
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,820
Speaker 1: Oh, so we had a vague idea and I just want to run this out there.

646
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,569
Speaker 1: We'll end them at a moment.

647
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:48,339
Speaker 1: Get into a review.

648
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,340
Speaker 0: But before you do this, the book club book is The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

649
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,640
Speaker 0: It is a fantasy novel.

650
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,580
Speaker 0: It was New York Times bestseller.

651
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,819
Speaker 0: It is lauded and a lot of people love it.

652
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:03,279
Speaker 0: So you should read it if you're a nerd.

653
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,659
Speaker 1: So people have been bothering us for a long time because, you know, we used to do a lot more final thoughts episodes of like entire series of anime.

654
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,498
Speaker 1: I think Trigun was like the biggest one of those we ever did.

655
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,955
Speaker 1: And Big O too.

656
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:17,440
Speaker 1: We did a really good one for as well in like 2006.

657
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,820
Speaker 0: We haven't done one in a long time because we did Evangelion, didn't we?

658
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,643
Speaker 1: I think we did.

659
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:24,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we haven't really finished watching.

660
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:26,052
Speaker 0: We did Monica.

661
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:26,699
Speaker 0: We did Monica.

662
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:27,641
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

663
00:34:27,743 --> 00:34:32,159
Speaker 1: Anyway, the one that has been the most requested is Shoujo Kakamei Utena.

664
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,743
Speaker 1: Well, duh.

665
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:34,800
Speaker 1: I have seen like four times.

666
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,520
Speaker 0: The problem is the show is 50 something episodes.

667
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,040
Speaker 0: So it's not Scott.

668
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:39,806
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

669
00:34:39,826 --> 00:34:40,431
Speaker 1: It's 52, I thought.

670
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:41,746
Speaker 0: Oh, 48.

671
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:41,828
Speaker 0: No.

672
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:44,885
Speaker 1: What what number is?

673
00:34:44,945 --> 00:34:48,760
Speaker 1: a is a typical three partial season anime?

674
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,739
Speaker 1: This used to be one of our questions on Fanboy Feud in the anime club.

675
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,159
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

676
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:55,983
Speaker 0: Thirty nine.

677
00:34:56,003 --> 00:34:58,719
Speaker 0: No, because there's either thirty nine.

678
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:02,940
Speaker 0: I feel I don't think it was thirteen, thirteen, thirteen.

679
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,000
Speaker 1: It was thirteen, thirteen.

680
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:06,974
Speaker 1: It was actually more like thirteen, thirteen, ten.

681
00:35:08,461 --> 00:35:09,124
Speaker 1: The end.

682
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:11,052
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's still.

683
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:12,720
Speaker 0: it's more episodes than the usual.

684
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,320
Speaker 1: And it's thirty nine episodes.

685
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,493
Speaker 0: And it also was never really released in a nice box.

686
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,120
Speaker 0: that wasn't fucked up in any way.

687
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,660
Speaker 1: The previous box that was fine.

688
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,680
Speaker 1: The only part that was fucked up was the first season.

689
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,600
Speaker 1: Thirteen episodes because it was put out on two also shiddily encoded DVDs.

690
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:31,380
Speaker 0: Also, when I started to rewatch it, the first DVD was in my Xbox.

691
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:32,111
Speaker 0: I got stolen.

692
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:32,619
Speaker 1: Yeah.

693
00:35:34,903 --> 00:35:36,879
Speaker 0: So now I guess I had to rewatch it again again.

694
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:41,860
Speaker 1: And so what we're thinking about doing is we'd have to rewatch Utena anyway.

695
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:43,440
Speaker 1: Of course, to be able to do a final thought.

696
00:35:44,123 --> 00:35:47,180
Speaker 0: I remember only the most basic of information.

697
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:47,822
Speaker 1: Really?

698
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:50,060
Speaker 1: I can actually quote some things that people say.

699
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:52,019
Speaker 0: I can quote some things.

700
00:35:53,882 --> 00:35:54,679
Speaker 1: I am a feminist.

701
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,956
Speaker 1: Choo choo.

702
00:35:57,883 --> 00:35:59,420
Speaker 0: I can quote all of Choo choo's lines.

703
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,047
Speaker 0: Definitely.

704
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:00,699
Speaker 1: No, you can't.

705
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,875
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, oh.

706
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:10,479
Speaker 1: So we're thinking about doing is if we watch the show again to be able to do a deep, like detailed final thoughts.

707
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,758
Speaker 1: We're thinking about doing it episode by episode, making a separate show that'll just run for thirty nine episodes and then be done with it.

708
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,220
Speaker 1: So I'm asking you very rarely, will we talk about something we're going to do?

709
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,560
Speaker 0: And, you know, that feels like a really long trek up this really tall staircase.

710
00:36:27,843 --> 00:36:28,058
Speaker 0: It does.

711
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:29,799
Speaker 0: I don't know.

712
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:32,226
Speaker 0: What was it?

713
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,640
Speaker 0: Are you sure everything will get tired before the end?

714
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,648
Speaker 0: Let's just what was it?

715
00:36:35,688 --> 00:36:36,920
Speaker 0: Let's take the elevator.

716
00:36:39,502 --> 00:36:40,956
Speaker 0: It's been there the whole time.

717
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:44,459
Speaker 1: The gondola.

718
00:36:46,563 --> 00:36:50,660
Speaker 1: So if do you guys if we made something like that, it's very rare.

719
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,198
Speaker 1: We tell you guys about stuff like this.

720
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:54,106
Speaker 1: Would you watch it?

721
00:36:54,187 --> 00:36:57,783
Speaker 0: Because if not enough of you know, anyone who's listening will say yes to anything.

722
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,418
Speaker 0: Hey, if I put a camera in my butt and poop, will you watch it?

723
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, they will.

724
00:37:04,902 --> 00:37:12,867
Speaker 1: So your choices are the Scott butt poop cam or thirty nine episodes of us doing the RFE treatment.

725
00:37:12,968 --> 00:37:14,020
Speaker 0: That's a false dichotomy.

726
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,703
Speaker 0: They can have both.

727
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,260
Speaker 1: That'll be the fortieth episode.

728
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:22,252
Speaker 0: Now, here's the real trick.

729
00:37:22,272 --> 00:37:23,160
Speaker 0: Can they tell the difference?

730
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,700
Speaker 1: All I can picture now is James Rolfe trying to describe muck spreading and failing.

731
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:30,399
Speaker 0: I don't have a tail, sadly.

732
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:34,160
Speaker 1: If we made some sort of mechanical tail for you.

733
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,725
Speaker 0: But I wouldn't want to.

734
00:37:35,189 --> 00:37:36,339
Speaker 0: I wouldn't want a fairy tale.

735
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:37,283
Speaker 0: You know, you could.

736
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:40,340
Speaker 0: you would want like, you know, some sort of lizard ish devil tale.

737
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,700
Speaker 1: You should use one of those little battery operated fans that tourists use in the summer.

738
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:46,367
Speaker 0: I don't think those can.

739
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:49,122
Speaker 0: They'll just think that could spread muck as soon as it hits the muck.

740
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,520
Speaker 0: It'll just sort of go and stop.

741
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,939
Speaker 0: The motor does not have the power to supercharge that shit.

742
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:54,207
Speaker 0: Then maybe it would work.

743
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:55,820
Speaker 1: Then the tool man Taylor knows what to do.

744
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,607
Speaker 1: What does it need?

745
00:37:57,072 --> 00:37:57,739
Speaker 1: More power.

746
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,627
Speaker 0: All right.

747
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:03,020
Speaker 0: OK, let's move on to the actual episode.

748
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,920
Speaker 1: We watched a show called Gravity Falls.

749
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,577
Speaker 0: So I got to give you some background on this.

750
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,807
Speaker 0: You might have heard of this show.

751
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:10,419
Speaker 0: Background number one.

752
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:14,160
Speaker 0: Rim said, hey, we should watch this Gravity Falls thing.

753
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,000
Speaker 0: It's popular with the pony people.

754
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,080
Speaker 0: So I'm like, oh, well, there's no ponies right now.

755
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:19,578
Speaker 0: So maybe I'll watch this show.

756
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:19,962
Speaker 0: Yeah.

757
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:22,900
Speaker 0: But, you know, one mention of a thing is not enough.

758
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:28,500
Speaker 0: In fact, even when I do want to watch something, for example, that show about the peasant in the Jester and the whatever.

759
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,359
Speaker 1: You haven't watched that at all yet, have you?

760
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:31,711
Speaker 0: No, it's great.

761
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:32,640
Speaker 0: People recommended it.

762
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,300
Speaker 0: I said to myself, this is the thing that I want to watch.

763
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,468
Speaker 1: It's called Medieval Lives.

764
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:37,678
Speaker 0: Keep forgetting to watch it.

765
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,240
Speaker 0: So but this Gravity Falls thing.

766
00:38:40,441 --> 00:38:42,800
Speaker 0: So then since someone told me, I don't know who said this.

767
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:45,140
Speaker 0: It's the show with the vomiting rainbow.

768
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,239
Speaker 0: Now, that is a JPEG I've seen on the Internet.

769
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,640
Speaker 0: The gnome vomiting the rain.

770
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:57,720
Speaker 1: Now, it's worth noting at this point that when I went from my little pony to actually watching it was literally I saw an animated gif of Rainbow Dash doing something funny.

771
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,700
Speaker 1: And I was like, OK, right.

772
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,358
Speaker 0: So it's, you know, if someone made a JPEG of a show on the Internet that that maybe there's something to this show.

773
00:39:03,743 --> 00:39:03,945
Speaker 0: Right.

774
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:04,996
Speaker 0: Internet people are into it.

775
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:09,760
Speaker 0: And then, of course, strike number three comes at my parents house this weekend.

776
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:14,040
Speaker 0: And my mom says, hey, is this show you should watch Gravity Falls?

777
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,440
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh, Scott's mom actually has really good taste in like animation.

778
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:24,539
Speaker 0: Really, my mom and my sister are watching the show, but usually it's my sister watching shows like my sister watches like regular show.

779
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:24,961
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

780
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:27,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, your sister's high five goes and stuff like that.

781
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,359
Speaker 1: Gravity Falls is way up.

782
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,540
Speaker 0: But my mom was also watching this one.

783
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:37,999
Speaker 0: So I'm like, well, if my mom is independently telling me that she watches and I should watch this show, I guess I should watch this show.

784
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,000
Speaker 1: So Scott and I watched two episodes, two episodes just now.

785
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,719
Speaker 1: And Emily and I have watched some other episodes beyond that.

786
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:47,740
Speaker 1: So we've seen enough of the show to realize that it's actually pretty damn good.

787
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:49,159
Speaker 0: It's not pony level.

788
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:50,084
Speaker 1: It's not like.

789
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:54,242
Speaker 0: I'm not like voraciously going to go home and watch every remaining episode.

790
00:39:54,262 --> 00:39:57,323
Speaker 1: But it was telling me finish one episode and Scott was like, yeah, put the second one on.

791
00:39:57,404 --> 00:39:57,646
Speaker 1: Yeah.

792
00:39:57,847 --> 00:39:59,843
Speaker 1: And when it was done, Scott was like, you want to watch the third one?

793
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:01,100
Speaker 1: I was like, yeah, let's do the show.

794
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,482
Speaker 1: I'm hungry.

795
00:40:01,543 --> 00:40:01,744
Speaker 1: Yeah.

796
00:40:02,187 --> 00:40:04,060
Speaker 0: The show does have many good aspects.

797
00:40:04,261 --> 00:40:09,000
Speaker 0: And I will eventually watch as much of it until I get tired of it.

798
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:11,619
Speaker 1: So if we need to review the show, I'll just say this.

799
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:14,480
Speaker 1: It is in the same vein.

800
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:17,800
Speaker 1: If you like any of the following shows, there's a good chance you like this.

801
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:30,904
Speaker 1: My Little Pony, Phineas and Ferb, The Regular Show, any of those sort of modern cartoons that are popular among kids, but also popular among people who go to the New York Comic Con.

802
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:33,035
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's that kind of, you know, Homestuck.

803
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,222
Speaker 1: people seem to like this show.

804
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:34,886
Speaker 0: I don't know.

805
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:36,859
Speaker 0: It's not so much Adventure Time, though.

806
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,660
Speaker 1: No, but the people who like Adventure Time like Gravity Falls a lot and vice versa.

807
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,100
Speaker 0: It's definitely in that modern cartoon style.

808
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:52,739
Speaker 0: I think we're entering, I don't want to say a golden or silver or bronze age, but it's definitely not a platinum age.

809
00:40:53,101 --> 00:41:01,360
Speaker 0: So I'm going to call it a marble age because we got a lot of this material, you know, and now we're really good at chiseling.

810
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,664
Speaker 0: We've practiced a whole lot and some really adventurous sculptures and making some cool stuff.

811
00:41:05,684 --> 00:41:06,619
Speaker 0: You want to hang up in your house.

812
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:09,120
Speaker 1: So the premise of the show is a pretty pedestrian premise.

813
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:18,120
Speaker 1: Two kids from not the middle of nowhere are forced to live in the middle of nowhere with their horrid Uncle Stan, who appears to be Moses Black.

814
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:19,222
Speaker 0: Yeah.

815
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:27,740
Speaker 0: I mean, you can definitely see that these characters are all amalgamations of characters you already know, but amalgamated in sort of a good way, like Mabel.

816
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:28,201
Speaker 1: Yeah.

817
00:41:28,242 --> 00:41:33,998
Speaker 1: Who is the main reason to watch the show, in my opinion, is basically Homer Simpson if he was an 11 year old.

818
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,320
Speaker 0: OK, well, sort of right.

819
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,920
Speaker 0: So Mabel is sort of like Didi from Dexter's Lab and that she's the sister.

820
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:40,759
Speaker 0: She is a prominent character.

821
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:46,949
Speaker 0: She is often doing, you know, silly nonsense sort of things and saying silly nonsense sort of things.

822
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:47,091
Speaker 0: Right.

823
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,360
Speaker 0: But she is also not stupid.

824
00:41:50,861 --> 00:41:51,203
Speaker 0: Right.

825
00:41:51,404 --> 00:41:54,640
Speaker 0: And also is, you know, she is capable and can do awesome things.

826
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,440
Speaker 1: She reminds me of a season eight or nine Homer Simpson.

827
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:08,600
Speaker 0: I think, you know, I'm telling you, she's Didi from Dexter's Lab, but plus like extra competence and goodness and not torturing her brother when she is like grappling hook.

828
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,619
Speaker 1: That whole scene.

829
00:42:09,923 --> 00:42:11,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, that could have been Homer Simpson.

830
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:11,861
Speaker 0: Right.

831
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:15,280
Speaker 1: Well, sort of that exact that entire scene, note for note, could have been.

832
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:21,806
Speaker 0: I think that I think the key factor is that she's sort of got that, you know, dumbness and silliness.

833
00:42:21,966 --> 00:42:24,657
Speaker 0: But she is she doesn't like she is not she's not annoying.

834
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:26,898
Speaker 0: She's not bothering anyone.

835
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:29,639
Speaker 0: She's actually sort of helping out and doing good things.

836
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:34,960
Speaker 1: Well, I like how she does the Elaine of punching people to express most emotions.

837
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:37,646
Speaker 0: That sort of get out.

838
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:42,140
Speaker 0: the main character is really identifiable because he's totally a smart, normal dude.

839
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,600
Speaker 1: The second episode where they're going to go get a picture of a monster and he's like, all right, about 17 goddamn cameras.

840
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:48,064
Speaker 1: Yeah.

841
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:48,638
Speaker 1: Fucking this up.

842
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:50,939
Speaker 0: And in fact, the very beginning of the entire show.

843
00:42:51,161 --> 00:42:51,523
Speaker 0: Right.

844
00:42:51,563 --> 00:42:54,000
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, he's fucking evidence.

845
00:42:54,623 --> 00:42:55,895
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, you tell him.

846
00:42:57,101 --> 00:43:01,838
Speaker 0: Basically, if they go to live in these woods with their great uncle and it's like how they call him Grunkle Stan.

847
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:02,383
Speaker 0: Right.

848
00:43:02,403 --> 00:43:04,880
Speaker 0: There's a lot of good characters otherwise living in the woods.

849
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:12,960
Speaker 0: But there's also supernatural kind of stuff going on in the woods, like, you know, well, there's a little bit naughty cryptozoology.

850
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,262
Speaker 1: Well, Scott pointed out there's there's an Evangelion kind of scene with the Illuminati logo.

851
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:23,339
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, you know, the Evangelion opener shows you those rapid frames of animation to sort of that show you all this stuff.

852
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:30,880
Speaker 0: This said, the opener has one frame where it shows you sort of like the Illuminati pyramid with arms and legs, you know, really quickly at the end of the opener.

853
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:35,405
Speaker 1: Well, little things, too, like he finds this book that's like, oh, shit, there's bullshit in this town.

854
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:35,707
Speaker 0: Right.

855
00:43:35,727 --> 00:43:38,201
Speaker 0: So that's the other thing about the show that makes me want to watch it.

856
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,671
Speaker 0: more is that clearly they're in strong.

857
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:41,514
Speaker 0: I wouldn't even say hints.

858
00:43:41,595 --> 00:43:48,460
Speaker 0: that just there is a deeper subplot overarching of the hidden evilness of the woods.

859
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:56,750
Speaker 1: Now, be careful, because X-Files also pretended to have I was thinking the exact same fucking thing for that episode.

860
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:59,260
Speaker 0: when they find a UFO on the fucking beach.

861
00:43:59,440 --> 00:43:59,982
Speaker 0: There is.

862
00:44:00,022 --> 00:44:00,243
Speaker 1: Yep.

863
00:44:00,364 --> 00:44:05,899
Speaker 1: And then the piece of the UFO goes flying across the room and hits the Bible and points at a verse.

864
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:06,442
Speaker 1: Yeah.

865
00:44:06,803 --> 00:44:10,279
Speaker 1: And then next episode, I'm going to go chase this werewolf.

866
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:12,338
Speaker 1: So no UFO right there.

867
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:13,368
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

868
00:44:13,408 --> 00:44:14,539
Speaker 0: And they never went back to that.

869
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:16,271
Speaker 1: No, they went back to in the last episode.

870
00:44:16,331 --> 00:44:17,619
Speaker 1: is bullshit all disappeared then.

871
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:19,366
Speaker 0: I don't happen to see that.

872
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,740
Speaker 1: I stopped watching the X-Files because of that.

873
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:23,180
Speaker 0: I didn't see that episode anyway.

874
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,620
Speaker 1: There's like a ghost aborigine.

875
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:33,840
Speaker 0: And it's like in the last episode, you clearly stopped watching X-Files after when that I tell you when that episode had the werewolf.

876
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,867
Speaker 0: That was last episode.

877
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:36,480
Speaker 1: I was I think it was actually a werewolf.

878
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,120
Speaker 1: I don't remember whatever it fucking was.

879
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,025
Speaker 0: That was the last episode.

880
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:41,720
Speaker 1: I was like to say why I like Gravity Falls.

881
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,459
Speaker 1: Aside from the overarching plot, then, like, for example, he has this book.

882
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:47,380
Speaker 1: There's a very obvious three on the book.

883
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:48,305
Speaker 1: And spoilers.

884
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:50,579
Speaker 1: One of the episodes Emily and I watched that you didn't see.

885
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,480
Speaker 1: Someone else has a book with a different number on it.

886
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,384
Speaker 0: Dun, dun, dun.

887
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:57,800
Speaker 1: And that guy has an artifact of power that he found the book.

888
00:44:59,162 --> 00:45:00,960
Speaker 0: And, you know, the shady stuff in the woods anyway.

889
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:10,340
Speaker 0: But and you see this also they show you Grandpa Grunkle is he, you know, he goes down in some sort of secret passageway in his in his house there.

890
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,815
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's definitely up to something.

891
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,860
Speaker 0: And the book says don't trust anyone, which I guess includes Grunkle.

892
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:16,846
Speaker 0: And you know what?

893
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:19,020
Speaker 0: That's how I identify with the main character even more.

894
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,020
Speaker 0: He's smart enough in that he only trusts the sister.

895
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,040
Speaker 0: He doesn't even trust the Grunkle.

896
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,620
Speaker 1: I think he trusts Zeus pretty good, too.

897
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,283
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but he doesn't.

898
00:45:26,303 --> 00:45:29,640
Speaker 0: but he doesn't actually trust him with the book or anything like that or knowledge of it.

899
00:45:29,902 --> 00:45:31,219
Speaker 0: And he doesn't trust Grunkle either.

900
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:42,140
Speaker 1: The show also does a good job of skipping, like despite having a basically stereotypical plot from a very high level, it skips the kinds of things that shows like this usually do when they're made.

901
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,360
Speaker 1: Like when he finds the book and Mabel's like, what you looking at?

902
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,124
Speaker 1: And he tries to hide it.

903
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:48,720
Speaker 1: She's like, yeah, like you're actually not going to show it to me.

904
00:45:49,062 --> 00:45:50,051
Speaker 1: And then they just skip that.

905
00:45:50,354 --> 00:45:50,979
Speaker 1: And now she knows.

906
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, that but then it also in the same episode, it's like you'd be worried, like, should we trust her?

907
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,380
Speaker 0: But that same episode is like, yes, you can trust her.

908
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:00,767
Speaker 0: Also, she's from out of town.

909
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:03,279
Speaker 0: Don't trust anyone from Gravity Falls.

910
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:09,720
Speaker 1: The foreshadowed and then switch up as to what the deal was with the zombie was also pretty good.

911
00:46:09,861 --> 00:46:10,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was very good.

912
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:11,760
Speaker 0: That caught me by surprise.

913
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were scenes in both episodes you watched where I did LOL for reals.

914
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:18,919
Speaker 0: So it is a funny show.

915
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:26,620
Speaker 1: In the second episode, I think the moment is when the crazy old man is running around and he just like, throws this guy's sandwich out of his hand.

916
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,960
Speaker 0: When he did that jig, that was a great jig.

917
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:34,694
Speaker 0: And also the reference, I'm betting money.

918
00:46:34,734 --> 00:46:36,200
Speaker 0: that was a reference to O'Doyle rules.

919
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,179
Speaker 1: Oh, that totally was.

920
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,198
Speaker 0: There's that family, the red haired family of people on that boat are 100 percent.

921
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,319
Speaker 0: I go to him and I say, you know what that family is?

922
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,760
Speaker 0: And he's like, O'Doyle rules.

923
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,276
Speaker 0: And I'm like, that's what that is.

924
00:46:48,343 --> 00:46:49,260
Speaker 0: O'Doyle rules.

925
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,020
Speaker 1: Like there's this one scene when they're there.

926
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,840
Speaker 0: If you're listening to this and you don't know what O'Doyle rules is, you suck.

927
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:57,480
Speaker 1: That is the second best Adam Sandler movie.

928
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:07,480
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, it is the second best Adam Sandler movie because I really like Punch Drunk Love, but it's a different kind of movie anyway.

929
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:10,340
Speaker 1: Anyway, the best one is Happy Gilmore.

930
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:11,431
Speaker 1: There's just.

931
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:12,100
Speaker 1: no, you can't even.

932
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,229
Speaker 1: That's one of the funniest movies.

933
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:14,279
Speaker 0: nobody's arguing about.

934
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:16,160
Speaker 1: That is our generation's Caddyshack.

935
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:20,466
Speaker 0: Is there anything else to say about?

936
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,859
Speaker 0: grab the name is kind of a funny pun, right?

937
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:24,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

938
00:47:24,622 --> 00:47:25,340
Speaker 0: Gravity Falls.

939
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,820
Speaker 1: Also, I got to say, I really like the opening sequence.

940
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,820
Speaker 0: And I think it's because I actually kind of think the opening sequence is boring, but it's I guess it's better than ponies.

941
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,040
Speaker 0: Ponies, actually, I don't like the opening sequence.

942
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:41,060
Speaker 1: I like the fact that the opening sequence is kind of it's cool and well animated.

943
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,620
Speaker 1: The only thing I like about it gets to the two points of Mabel.

944
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:47,359
Speaker 1: It's like, wow, I've never seen an opening to anything ever.

945
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:52,760
Speaker 1: In two, three second scenes encapsulate everything there is to know about one character.

946
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:54,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess it does.

947
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,300
Speaker 0: It achieves that goal, but it's not like an opener.

948
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,079
Speaker 0: I want to watch.

949
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:07,760
Speaker 0: To me, a good opener is an opener where you're like, I want to watch the best opener to a show you've ever seen ever, ever because I'm trying to remember the best anime.

950
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:08,536
Speaker 1: All right.

951
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,560
Speaker 1: Let's talk just anime.

952
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,440
Speaker 1: I'm starting with My Heart, Sky Ties, My Baseline.

953
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,919
Speaker 1: So we got to name one better than that.

954
00:48:13,422 --> 00:48:14,559
Speaker 0: That's a really good one.

955
00:48:14,743 --> 00:48:15,520
Speaker 1: Before you forget.

956
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:18,499
Speaker 1: That alone does it.

957
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:23,037
Speaker 0: Oh, the Pat Labore first O.A.V Oh, that one's pretty good.

958
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,380
Speaker 1: Dominion Tank Police, but I can't count that because only the dub opener.

959
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, Ava opener is not bad.

960
00:48:32,941 --> 00:48:35,019
Speaker 0: Ava opener is not bad.

961
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:36,906
Speaker 1: But it's it doesn't do.

962
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:41,020
Speaker 1: it's not visually great, but it's great in that.

963
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,440
Speaker 1: Yes, that is a great thing way.

964
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:43,840
Speaker 0: Not great in the Gundam seed.

965
00:48:43,941 --> 00:48:45,360
Speaker 0: Openers are great at giving away the show.

966
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,200
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

967
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:46,764
Speaker 1: They're really.

968
00:48:46,986 --> 00:48:48,198
Speaker 1: they really pump you up to.

969
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:48,742
Speaker 0: Yeah.

970
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:49,658
Speaker 0: Anything that pumps you up.

971
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,617
Speaker 0: Initial D openers.

972
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

973
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,800
Speaker 0: It's got to pump me up for me to like it.

974
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,980
Speaker 0: That's the kind of opener I like, even video games.

975
00:48:56,484 --> 00:48:57,598
Speaker 0: I like anything that pumps you up.

976
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,259
Speaker 1: Utena opener is pretty good, too.

977
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:00,058
Speaker 0: Oh, that.

978
00:49:00,943 --> 00:49:02,580
Speaker 0: But you know, it's better than the antenna opener.

979
00:49:02,741 --> 00:49:03,116
Speaker 1: But the horses.

980
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,300
Speaker 0: No, you know, it's better than Utena opener.

981
00:49:05,582 --> 00:49:06,059
Speaker 1: Utena movie.

982
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:06,876
Speaker 0: Utena Closer.

983
00:49:07,562 --> 00:49:08,458
Speaker 1: Oh, which one?

984
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,739
Speaker 1: Missin' Kissin' for that one.

985
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,920
Speaker 1: Not the actually.

986
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:17,120
Speaker 1: I like the second closing more because that song is crazy.

987
00:49:18,045 --> 00:49:18,532
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

988
00:49:18,553 --> 00:49:19,020
Speaker 0: That's not bad.

989
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,239
Speaker 1: I really like that song.

990
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,459
Speaker 0: But they're all good.

991
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:27,479
Speaker 1: The thing is that is saying that because the closing in the second part of Utena is a little like, I don't know, it bothers me.

992
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,240
Speaker 1: Like there's something off about it on purpose.

993
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:32,400
Speaker 1: That's right when there's something bad going on in the show.

994
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,174
Speaker 0: All right, so.

995
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,180
Speaker 1: So gravity falls.

996
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:36,380
Speaker 1: You know what?

997
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,280
Speaker 1: Geek Nights Wednesdays animation.

998
00:49:39,908 --> 00:49:40,840
Speaker 1: It's not just anime.

999
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,579
Speaker 0: You didn't think you had to defend that.

1000
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,380
Speaker 1: So if you are in any way a fan of animation, you know what?

1001
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:48,780
Speaker 1: We're entering this renaissance of animation.

1002
00:49:49,461 --> 00:49:50,020
Speaker 0: I guess maybe.

1003
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:50,678
Speaker 1: Maybe.

1004
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,518
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just people seeing the success of ponies and trying to go for it.

1005
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,277
Speaker 1: So you know what?

1006
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,380
Speaker 1: Watch a couple episodes of Gravity Falls.

1007
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,899
Speaker 1: The worst case scenario, you don't like it and move on.

1008
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,889
Speaker 1: But it's no.

1009
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,880
Speaker 1: it's come under our baleful gaze.

1010
00:50:03,061 --> 00:50:04,760
Speaker 1: And you know how hard it is for anything.

1011
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:09,520
Speaker 0: One other thing to come under our animation quality is just as high as ponies.

1012
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:16,079
Speaker 0: But the opener actually uses this sort of lighting effect on the 2D so like time lapse of the sun going across.

1013
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're actually using these lighting effects, at least in the opener.

1014
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:27,640
Speaker 1: And I guess sometimes during the show, the use of color to the use the color in the show, especially around Mabel again and the rainbow.

1015
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:33,920
Speaker 0: It's a little bit like a darker color set than ponies, but it's just as much just as much variety in the color.

1016
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:43,960
Speaker 1: It's a darker and a lot of good lighting and shadows with occasionally like ridiculously juxtaposed color, like in the suddenly in the middle of what is otherwise a much darker palette.

1017
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:44,280
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1018
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:49,220
Speaker 0: And especially the lighting, like when they're running away from that monster and the glowing eyes, there was some really good lighting going on.

1019
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:49,839
Speaker 0: That was really good.

1020
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,520
Speaker 0: So that sort of puts it, I guess, you know, half a step above ponies, maybe in terms of animation quality.

1021
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:04,420
Speaker 1: And it's worth noting that we both I mean, if nothing else, the only the best review I can give of any show like this is that we both laughed out loud more than once across multiple episodes.

1022
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:04,995
Speaker 0: Yep.

1023
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,199
Speaker 1: There are very few things in the world that are capable of making me laugh out loud like that.

1024
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,080
Speaker 0: I think we're done.

1025
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:11,939
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

1026
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:13,939
Speaker 0: So we'll see you next week.

1027
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,440
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1028
