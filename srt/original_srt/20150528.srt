1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,284
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, May 28th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,284 --> 00:00:10,666
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:14,539
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,700
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights tonight on the Geek Nights Book Club.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,158
Speaker 1: Watership down.

6
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:22,171
Speaker 0: Land.

7
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:22,700
Speaker 0: Car up.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,268
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:33,910
Speaker 1: So yeah, we'll be real brief on the news and all the like, you know, stuff that won't make sense 20 years from now to get right into the book club part.

10
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,470
Speaker 1: But stuff's happening, you know, usual stuff.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,070
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna try to make a vow to you guys this summer.

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,990
Speaker 1: We've been known for the last several years, talking a lot about biking in the city.

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:55,210
Speaker 1: I am going to try to tell not one anecdote about some fixie guy that I run afoul of for the entire summer on Geek Nights.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,690
Speaker 0: Did you run into a fixie guy today?

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,056
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't bike today.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,070
Speaker 1: But yesterday.

17
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:03,580
Speaker 0: It's not summer yet.

18
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:04,910
Speaker 0: Oh, he's got you.

19
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:06,592
Speaker 1: All I'll say is this.

20
00:01:07,353 --> 00:01:17,710
Speaker 1: The second funniest thing in the world is fixie guys having to walk their bike up a not that steep incline because they literally cannot bike up those inclines.

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,549
Speaker 1: Like, that's pretty funny.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,950
Speaker 0: The third funniest thing is when they stand up and go "huh, huh, huh" and get up the incline.

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:29,050
Speaker 1: And the fourth funniest is when they do that to pass you and they look back at you, like see how much faster I am, and then you just pass them because they slow down.

24
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:40,510
Speaker 1: But the funniest thing that many people don't always realize, because some people have fake fixies, is that a real fixie bike, a fixed gear bike, cannot coast.

25
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,570
Speaker 1: So the pedals are always moving, like a kid's tricycle.

26
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,050
Speaker 0: Yep, if the wheels are moving, the pedal is moving.

27
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:57,950
Speaker 1: So those people, not only do they walk their bike up the Williamsburg Bridge, but then they have to walk it back down because they literally cannot bike down the hill.

28
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:00,949
Speaker 1: It is so beautiful to behold.

29
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:02,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

30
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:11,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm going to pointedly, I ran afoul of a fixie person who was walking the bike down the hill but still in the bike lane, blocking the bike lane.

31
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,729
Speaker 1: So I dinged at him and he jumped on his bike and chased after me to yell at me.

32
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:25,949
Speaker 1: And I looked back at him and I basically said something to the effect of "It's a shame you're in a children's bike or you might be able to catch

33
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:26,149
Speaker 1: me.".

34
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:31,450
Speaker 1: And then I biked off and he yelled again a whole bunch, but then I never saw him again.

35
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,570
Speaker 1: That is my last fixie story for the entire of this summer.

36
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,687
Speaker 0: He's going to tell a story about "I've got a one-speed

37
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:37,950
Speaker 0: next."

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,590
Speaker 0: A non-fixed one-speed.

39
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:55,030
Speaker 1: The next time I bump into a fixie person who's not a fake fixie, like they just have a single gear bike, and they antagonize me, I guess I can impinge upon their hipster cred by disparaging the fact that they have a fake fixie.

40
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,809
Speaker 1: That they're a faux fixie biker.

41
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,510
Speaker 0: You know, the thing I don't understand, right, so I had a coworker and he was asking about, he wanted a bike and he's asking, right?

42
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,951
Speaker 1: They're like a Trek 7.3.

43
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,490
Speaker 0: I say the same thing I say to everyone.

44
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,909
Speaker 0: It's got to be comfortable, otherwise you're not going to ride it.

45
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,249
Speaker 0: You have to like it, otherwise you're not going to ride it.

46
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,330
Speaker 0: It should have brakes and it should have some number of gears.

47
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,550
Speaker 0: Even three gears is enough in the city, right?

48
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, the hub gear is okay.

49
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,350
Speaker 0: It's going to get you up the hill, right?

50
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,790
Speaker 0: If you don't care about biking, that's enough.

51
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,425
Speaker 0: I mean, 10 is more, I don't even, I have like 21 combinations.

52
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,130
Speaker 0: Most, some of them are identical effectively because it's the same ratio, but I don't use even a fraction of all of those.

53
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,370
Speaker 0: I use mostly like maybe six different combinations, right?

54
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,570
Speaker 0: Like three speeds for different hills and three speeds are going fast and normal.

55
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,330
Speaker 0: It's pretty legit.

56
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,390
Speaker 0: So that's what I told him, but it's like, you know, he's one of those people who's like worried, like it's got to be perfect.

57
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,050
Speaker 0: Like, so everything I'm like, you know, I'm just like, yeah, you know, some bikes have comp gears and some of them have regular.

58
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:54,549
Speaker 0: He's like, oh no, which one did I get?

59
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,670
Speaker 0: And I'm like, it just doesn't matter.

60
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,391
Speaker 0: You know what it is?

61
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:04,390
Speaker 1: Remember way back there was that Ted talk on if you give someone too many choices and they're not good at living, then they'll be less satisfied with any choice.

62
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:04,771
Speaker 0: Right.

63
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:10,270
Speaker 0: It's like, he really just needed to make sure, like, you know, every option he knew about, it's like, you felt like you had to make the right one.

64
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,490
Speaker 0: And I'm like, it doesn't matter what you want.

65
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,369
Speaker 1: I bump into that a lot and I actually figured out a good way around it.

66
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,610
Speaker 0: So here's how you tell people about these options.

67
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,132
Speaker 1: No, no.

68
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:19,355
Speaker 1: Yeah.

69
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:20,950
Speaker 1: Here's what you tell people like that.

70
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:28,830
Speaker 1: And I've learned when I give advice to never offer all that information I have about, oh, there's four different kinds of breaks instead.

71
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,030
Speaker 1: What I write is I ask them a couple of questions, like what kind of biking do you want to do or whatever.

72
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,130
Speaker 1: And then I sort of say, yeah, like I'm a bike expert.

73
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:40,629
Speaker 1: You want get this bike with this break option and this thing.

74
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,369
Speaker 1: Just just make the decision for them because you know what?

75
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,509
Speaker 1: Otherwise, they're never going to buy a bike.

76
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,050
Speaker 0: Right.

77
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:51,610
Speaker 0: But one thing that really bothered me was he's like, I'm thinking about getting a one speed, you know, because it's so simple.

78
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,054
Speaker 0: Wow.

79
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,450
Speaker 0: And I'm like, it seems to me.

80
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,490
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about getting a 486 because it's so simple.

81
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,650
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying is people were like, for some reason with bicycles, there's this attitude of we want simplicity.

82
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,253
Speaker 0: Right.

83
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,389
Speaker 0: It's like simplicity is a good thing.

84
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a derailleur.

85
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,110
Speaker 0: And I'm like, oh, well, why don't you go use an Apple, too?

86
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,849
Speaker 0: Because it's a lot simpler than that MacBook.

87
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:11,930
Speaker 1: Why don't you have a dumb phone?

88
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,969
Speaker 0: Why don't you go get a model?

89
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,690
Speaker 0: Why don't you get a model T Ford?

90
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,509
Speaker 0: Because it's a way simpler than the other car.

91
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,250
Speaker 0: Right.

92
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:28,550
Speaker 0: And it's like, I think the problem that bicycles have, the reason people want them to be simpler is because if you look, people like an Apple compared to, say, a PC.

93
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:28,998
Speaker 0: Yeah.

94
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,410
Speaker 0: It's not because it is simpler.

95
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:34,570
Speaker 0: It's because the complexity, they can't see it.

96
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:41,030
Speaker 0: If you made a MacBook with a transparent case so you could see all the bullshit inside, people would be like, fuck that noise.

97
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,026
Speaker 0: They wouldn't like it.

98
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:45,350
Speaker 0: It's because a bicycle cannot hide its gears.

99
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:46,552
Speaker 0: Right.

100
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:47,529
Speaker 0: Because it doesn't look.

101
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,309
Speaker 1: No, I think I think it's much simpler than that.

102
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:54,010
Speaker 1: I think it's like when an old person sits at a computer and says, I can't computer.

103
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:58,710
Speaker 1: And they don't even look at the screen because I would say.

104
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,350
Speaker 0: But this person hasn't even looked at anything.

105
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:00,904
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

106
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:05,570
Speaker 0: For some reason, when it comes to bicycles, they prioritize simplicity.

107
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,429
Speaker 0: But when it comes to other things in life, they don't.

108
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,970
Speaker 1: Next time someone does that, ask them a simple question and be a jerk to make sure they answer it.

109
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:25,810
Speaker 1: Ask if they know how to shift gears on a bike, because I am really convinced that the vast majority, like 95 percent of the people biking in New York City, if the gears shift from one gear to another, it's entirely by accident.

110
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,236
Speaker 1: And they have never used those shifters.

111
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:34,050
Speaker 1: because if all they know is if they move the shifter a little bit, the gears start making a bunch of noise and they're worried they're going to break it.

112
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:37,930
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure people stay in whatever gear the bike was in when they got the bike.

113
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:45,370
Speaker 0: There's a lot of people like bicycling Reddit who like one speeds and like fixies, despite clearly knowing how gears work and how to use them.

114
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,699
Speaker 1: Oh, those people are a special kind of moron because they always make the same arguments.

115
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,650
Speaker 1: They always say it's easier to repair and maintain, which isn't true at all.

116
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,681
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it is true in the sense that, yes, you will have a problem with the derailleur.

117
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,204
Speaker 0: that is a good one once every 20 years.

118
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:06,882
Speaker 0: So there'll be one in time in 20 years.

119
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:09,050
Speaker 0: your bike won't break if it's a one speed.

120
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:10,929
Speaker 1: I used to mountain bike.

121
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:15,730
Speaker 0: It's an inconsequential, insignificant difference of reliability.

122
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:23,309
Speaker 1: In the thousands and thousands of crazy miles I've done on bikes over the years, I have never had a problem with a derailleur.

123
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,170
Speaker 0: My bike has 4000 miles on it and has more gears than are necessary, and it has no problem.

124
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,150
Speaker 1: I've had problems with the brake line snapping, which, oh, the same thing can happen to a fixie.

125
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:37,709
Speaker 0: I had to replace the tires and make the brakes tighter and change the brake pads, and that's it.

126
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,095
Speaker 1: I've had to replace tires before, but you know what?

127
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,961
Speaker 1: The people who want that simplicity, they always have the rims.

128
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:46,950
Speaker 1: They're actually super complicated and difficult to get the tires off and replace.

129
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,250
Speaker 0: Well, they don't do it themselves.

130
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,649
Speaker 1: Well, if they're not doing it themselves, why do they care about the simplicity?

131
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,061
Speaker 0: Because they just have these stupid ideas.

132
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:54,609
Speaker 0: Like, you know, I don't know.

133
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird because I see so many fixies.

134
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,670
Speaker 0: Is it the same attitude that makes them not want to eat genetically modified food?

135
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:10,270
Speaker 1: But I also see so many people who don't have fixed gear bikes but ride them like they're fixed gear bikes and never change gears ever or don't know how to change gears.

136
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:20,830
Speaker 1: Which, actually, that sentiment, many people that we know, it has been revealed over the years that despite biking a lot, they had no idea how gears worked on bikes.

137
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:23,555
Speaker 1: So, I don't know what to do about that.

138
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:24,619
Speaker 1: And it's not car stuff.

139
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:28,150
Speaker 1: I mean, I knew how gears worked on a bike long before I knew cars had gears.

140
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,830
Speaker 0: I knew how gears worked on a bike in fifth grade.

141
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got my first geared bike.

142
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,172
Speaker 0: It had a 10-speed bike.

143
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,658
Speaker 0: It had two in the front and five in the back.

144
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:39,807
Speaker 0: And I said, "Ooh, there are things on here that my previous bike didn't have.

145
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:40,347
Speaker 0: What do they

146
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:40,529
Speaker 0: do?".

147
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,921
Speaker 0: And someone told me, like, I clicked them and nothing happened.

148
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,487
Speaker 0: And they're like, "You have to click them while you're

149
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:45,828
Speaker 0: moving.".

150
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,740
Speaker 0: So, I started moving and I clicked it.

151
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,269
Speaker 0: And I said, "Oh, I understand

152
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:51,350
Speaker 0: now.".

153
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,792
Speaker 0: Clicking?

154
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:52,094
Speaker 1: Really?

155
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,210
Speaker 1: Because back then, most bikes had a continuous lever shifter.

156
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,578
Speaker 0: It was, but it still clicked, right?

157
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:03,390
Speaker 0: It was a lever that moved from top to bottom, but it would actually stop as you moved it.

158
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:04,228
Speaker 1: That's kind of fancy.

159
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:05,428
Speaker 0: Whatever.

160
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,977
Speaker 1: Mine did not click.

161
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:08,950
Speaker 1: Mine was just a continuous, like, whoop, whoop.

162
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:15,850
Speaker 0: It's like you would push it from one to two and it was slightly smooth, but when it got to two, it would stop a little bit.

163
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:18,797
Speaker 1: So, anyway, in the, what?

164
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:20,200
Speaker 1: Okay, I just got a weird email.

165
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,461
Speaker 1: Anyway.

166
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:24,190
Speaker 1: So, in the news, something interesting happened.

167
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,950
Speaker 1: And it's interesting enough for I actually want to talk about it on a Thursday on the lounge, even though it's a Book Club episode.

168
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:30,320
Speaker 1: Sure.

169
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,173
Speaker 1: The U.S.

170
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:34,410
Speaker 1: state of Nebraska, which is traditionally pretty conservative.

171
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,569
Speaker 0: It's basically a place they grow corn.

172
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:45,810
Speaker 1: Just abolished the death penalty and commuted all the sentences of everyone on Death Row, which was 10 people, to life sentences.

173
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,710
Speaker 0: If it's so conservative, why would they do such a liberal thing?

174
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,336
Speaker 1: So, this is where it actually gets really interesting.

175
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:58,690
Speaker 1: Not only did they abolish it, but the Senate in the state, the state only has one legislative body.

176
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,954
Speaker 1: It's the Senate.

177
00:10:00,014 --> 00:10:01,519
Speaker 1: It's majority Republican.

178
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:04,770
Speaker 1: The Senate voted to abolish the death penalty.

179
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,406
Speaker 0: What was the vote?

180
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:07,647
Speaker 1: The governor vetoed it.

181
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,765
Speaker 0: And the Senate undid?

182
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,529
Speaker 1: The Senate overrode his veto.

183
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:13,308
Speaker 0: Okay.

184
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,870
Speaker 1: Which is already getting a little bit crazy.

185
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,456
Speaker 0: Yeah, that hardly ever happens.

186
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,810
Speaker 0: Especially, I'm guessing the governor is also Republican.

187
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:20,952
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

188
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:26,410
Speaker 1: And also, the governor seems to be a really, really shitty person.

189
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,649
Speaker 0: Which governor is not a shitty person?

190
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:33,530
Speaker 1: Should have been Zephyr Teachout.

191
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:34,673
Speaker 0: It's not.

192
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:35,906
Speaker 0: I'm saying which existing...

193
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:38,808
Speaker 1: Zephyr Teachout was running for governor.

194
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,669
Speaker 0: Which governor of any state ever was not a piece of shit.

195
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,875
Speaker 1: So, here's what Mr.

196
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:48,110
Speaker 1: Ricketts said when they overrode his veto to a huge degree.

197
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,989
Speaker 0: They should just put him on Death Row.

198
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:59,310
Speaker 1: My words cannot express how appalled I am that we have lost a critical tool to protect law enforcement and Nebraska families.

199
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:07,970
Speaker 1: While the legislature has lost touch with the citizens of Nebraska, I will continue to stand with Nebraskans and law enforcement on this important issue.

200
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:15,350
Speaker 1: The only people in the state who are for this are cops, and this governor, and a handful of Republicans.

201
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:18,822
Speaker 0: Why are these other people against it?

202
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:20,190
Speaker 0: That's the only important question.

203
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:24,229
Speaker 0: This is the first conservative state that has done this since, like, the 70s.

204
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,615
Speaker 0: You keep talking about meaningless bullshit.

205
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,664
Speaker 0: Why are these people voting against?

206
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,030
Speaker 0: what is their party line?

207
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,276
Speaker 1: So, this is how it's fucked up.

208
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:33,890
Speaker 1: The Democrats were against it because they're against the death penalty.

209
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:42,208
Speaker 1: Some of the Republicans are also against the death penalty, and because it's state-level politics, you can get away with having an opinion like that.

210
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:42,850
Speaker 1: Like, it won't matter.

211
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,629
Speaker 0: But, why are they against it?

212
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:51,450
Speaker 1: Well, some of them, I've been getting to that, like, the Democrats are just against the death penalty fundamentally, like, for philosophical reasons.

213
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:59,730
Speaker 1: The rest of them are against it because it's too expensive, and they're trying to reduce government spending.

214
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,609
Speaker 0: That's fine.

215
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:21,970
Speaker 1: And one of them said one of the, like, it's horrifying the way he said it, but he basically said that he's in favor of the death penalty, but Nebraska just isn't getting its bang for its buck when it comes to executing people, so we should save the money and just not even try to kill people anymore.

216
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:29,970
Speaker 1: He used the phrase "not getting our bang for our buck" in reference to the death penalty.

217
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:40,430
Speaker 1: So, part of this seems to be about the fact that the companies that make the drugs they use in lethal injection are basically not making them anymore.

218
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:45,270
Speaker 0: But aren't those people, like, bribing the government to make them be pro-death penalty?

219
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,772
Speaker 1: No, so basically, no, they're not.

220
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:56,350
Speaker 1: They don't want, like, a lot of the ways we use, like, the chemicals we use to execute people, the people who make them won't sell them to a state that has the death penalty.

221
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,750
Speaker 1: Because they don't want it to be used for the death penalty.

222
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:03,390
Speaker 0: Aren't chemical manufacturers generally pretty conservative?

223
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,569
Speaker 1: No, not this kind of stuff.

224
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:06,087
Speaker 0: Okay.

225
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:21,490
Speaker 1: So, they don't actually have current certified versions of the chemicals to do it, so they have to change their laws to come up with a different method, and it's all just so expensive, so the Republicans were against it for financial reasons and not for human reasons.

226
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,750
Speaker 0: Alright, well, whatever.

227
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:28,090
Speaker 1: They have logistical difficulties with lethal injections, and I don't think they have their electric chair anymore.

228
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm surprised.

229
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:32,070
Speaker 0: Why don't they just switch to hanging or guillotine?

230
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,788
Speaker 1: Because they'd have to change their laws to do that.

231
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:43,610
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, a guillotine is actually, like, a good thing, in a way, not because it's good to guillotine people, or kill people, right?

232
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,470
Speaker 0: But because the people who, if you're killed by a guillotine, it's actually, you know, a painless way to go.

233
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:50,869
Speaker 1: Well, that's debatable.

234
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,449
Speaker 0: As long as it's a very nice and sharp one.

235
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,369
Speaker 1: Wasn't there that famous old experiment during the French Revolution where the guy was awake for, like, 20 seconds?

236
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,530
Speaker 0: It's gotta be a sharp one.

237
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,008
Speaker 1: No, his head was awake for, like, 20 seconds.

238
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:13,070
Speaker 0: You could also do the method where you have a boulder and you crush the person's head, anyway, but it's also good because it's so gruesome, it forces the horrible people who support the death penalty to, like, be face-to-face with how horrible it is.

239
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,648
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

240
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,689
Speaker 0: So that they can't, so that they, you know, they're forced to not be for it.

241
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:22,489
Speaker 1: Being face-to-face with it might just go back to medieval times where kids cheered in the street and threw tomatoes at the dancing guy.

242
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,390
Speaker 0: I don't think modern people could stomach.

243
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,430
Speaker 1: Modern people are not different from medieval people.

244
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,263
Speaker 0: As soon as they saw one, they'd be like, "Ah,

245
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:31,969
Speaker 0: shit.".

246
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,927
Speaker 1: No, but then they see ten, 'cause, you know...

247
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:40,170
Speaker 0: Also, the law, you know, when it comes to, like, you know, executing people, right, in the United States, nobody's forced to look, right?

248
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,689
Speaker 0: It's like, sometimes they'll let you look if you want, but nobody's forced to look.

249
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:52,530
Speaker 0: If there was a death penalty, like, you couldn't just not have it, which is the right way to go, certain people should be forced to see it.

250
00:14:53,010 --> 00:15:05,409
Speaker 0: Anyone, the lawyer who was prosecuting the person, let's say it was a murder trial and, like, your relative got murdered and you were, like, pushing for the murderer to get the death penalty, you should be forced to watch.

251
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,049
Speaker 0: Any politician who voted for the death penalty to be, like, legal should be forced to watch every time.

252
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,689
Speaker 0: And if any of those people aren't there to see it or closing their eyes, then they don't do it.

253
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:25,570
Speaker 1: There's a quote from the article, "Across the country, efforts to execute criminals in death robes stalled in the face of backlash against the death penalty in liberal states and logistical difficulties with the drugs.

254
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:30,190
Speaker 1: Many states have had difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs, as European manufacturers...".

255
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,890
Speaker 0: Oh, European manufacturers!

256
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,328
Speaker 1: "...setting moral and ethical objections have refused to sell them to prisons in the United

257
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:37,609
Speaker 1: States.".

258
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:38,143
Speaker 1: Texas?

259
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,890
Speaker 0: Aren't there American manufacturers?

260
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:40,714
Speaker 1: No!

261
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:43,709
Speaker 1: And the few that are have the same problems.

262
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:49,390
Speaker 1: Also, it's hard to find doctors who are willing to violate the Hippocratic oath and kill people like that.

263
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,920
Speaker 0: There were doctors doing it?

264
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,230
Speaker 0: I thought it was just, like, executionists.

265
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,229
Speaker 1: No, there's so many laws about it.

266
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:54,623
Speaker 1: The hangman.

267
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, at least lethal injection.

268
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:58,530
Speaker 0: Isn't it someone's job to be the hangman?

269
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:07,790
Speaker 1: Texas, which executes more inmates than any other state, only has enough drugs to carry out one more execution.

270
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:08,450
Speaker 1: Alright.

271
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:09,849
Speaker 1: And they can't get more.

272
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:25,850
Speaker 1: So, the death penalty is actually, like, at this tipping point where the US might end up abolishing it completely, partly because liberal states are banning it on human reasons, and equally partly because conservative states are finding it too expensive to keep doing it.

273
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,670
Speaker 0: But it's like, here's the thing I understand, right?

274
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:32,310
Speaker 0: It's like, can't imagine Obama for all of his, you know, whatevers, right?

275
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,242
Speaker 0: He probably doesn't support the death penalty.

276
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:35,530
Speaker 0: I don't imagine he does, right?

277
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,730
Speaker 1: It's probably a state issue.

278
00:16:37,852 --> 00:16:39,249
Speaker 1: Remember, Congress has to do it, not him.

279
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,049
Speaker 0: But, no, he could just pardon anyone who's on death row.

280
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:43,409
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

281
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:45,568
Speaker 0: If I was the president, that's the fuck I would do.

282
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:46,850
Speaker 0: And then you know what would happen?

283
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:53,745
Speaker 0: They'd be like, that person murdered 20 people, and I'm like, well, I'm not going to murder one person, so pardon or don't kill them.

284
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:54,470
Speaker 0: That's your choice.

285
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,214
Speaker 0: I'm going to pardon them.

286
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:55,898
Speaker 0: I'm about to sign it.

287
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:56,361
Speaker 0: Fix it.

288
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:56,904
Speaker 0: Fix it.

289
00:16:57,346 --> 00:16:57,588
Speaker 0: Pardon.

290
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:57,930
Speaker 0: It's too late.

291
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,710
Speaker 1: So, interestingly, two things I learned a while ago that I just thought of recently.

292
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:04,282
Speaker 1: You cannot pardon someone before they've been convicted.

293
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:05,530
Speaker 1: Not relevant here.

294
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,069
Speaker 0: Obviously.

295
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,910
Speaker 1: But the reason for that is you could pardon a hit man.

296
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:19,589
Speaker 1: So, anyway, but in terms of the pardoning stuff, politically it would destroy the Democrats.

297
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,270
Speaker 1: It turned into a Willie Horton all over again.

298
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,507
Speaker 0: I don't know what Willie Horton is.

299
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:25,589
Speaker 1: You should learn about old politics.

300
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,808
Speaker 0: I don't need to know about that.

301
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,290
Speaker 1: Anyway, you got any short news before we talk about rabbits?

302
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,035
Speaker 0: I do have news.

303
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,150
Speaker 0: So, here's some actual interesting thing, right?

304
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:39,510
Speaker 0: Is that FIFA, who is known to be, the people who run soccer worldwide, have known to be wicked corrupt for a long time.

305
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,130
Speaker 0: And their extreme corruption is bringing the World Cup to Qatar, or however you want to pronounce it, Qatar.

306
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:46,590
Speaker 1: I say Qatar.

307
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,330
Speaker 0: I say Qatar, but everyone else seems to be saying Qatar.

308
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,619
Speaker 0: I don't really care.

309
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:51,246
Speaker 0: Sorry, Qatar.

310
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:59,870
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, yeah, there's all sorts of horrible slave labor type conditions to build soccer stadiums there.

311
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,658
Speaker 0: And there's all kinds of other issues.

312
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,630
Speaker 0: like no one can play soccer in a desert.

313
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,747
Speaker 0: It would suck.

314
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,769
Speaker 0: And you would probably just pass out on the field.

315
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,310
Speaker 0: Because you had to play soccer for like 90 minutes straight without stopping.

316
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:14,250
Speaker 1: Now, no one knew about this except people who pay attention to things in the world.

317
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,087
Speaker 1: Until John Oliver was like, "Hey, look at

318
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:16,249
Speaker 1: this.".

319
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,308
Speaker 0: But that was like a year ago.

320
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,630
Speaker 0: And the thing is, I knew about it even before then.

321
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,310
Speaker 1: Well, because you pay attention to stuff.

322
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:23,730
Speaker 1: Well, you pay attention to inconsequential stuff.

323
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:25,570
Speaker 0: It's even more corrupt than the Olympic Committee.

324
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:32,668
Speaker 0: So, the US, some justice department or whatever, actually was like, "We're going to go and get these corrupt FIFA

325
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:32,930
Speaker 0: people.".

326
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:34,140
Speaker 0: And they have a case on them.

327
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:35,109
Speaker 0: But they had to get them.

328
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,770
Speaker 0: Apparently, they were in Switzerland.

329
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,890
Speaker 0: And Switzerland, despite usually not doing this kind of thing, arrested them in extraditism.

330
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,470
Speaker 1: Actually, Switzerland will happily do it.

331
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,990
Speaker 1: The only thing Switzerland won't extradite for, specifically with our treaty, is tax stuff.

332
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,291
Speaker 0: Yep.

333
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:53,830
Speaker 0: So, if you evade US taxes, you can go to Switzerland and they will not send you to the US.

334
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,330
Speaker 0: Exactly.

335
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,490
Speaker 0: You can just stay in Switzerland as long as your visa is there.

336
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,950
Speaker 1: But if you run FIFA, they will totally send you back to the US.

337
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,512
Speaker 0: Sure.

338
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:04,714
Speaker 0: So, I guess they were having won at soccer enough recently to make them want to... But here's the thing.

339
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:06,990
Speaker 0: Number one, they didn't go after the chief dude, Blatter.

340
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,309
Speaker 0: It's like, why not?

341
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,830
Speaker 0: And two, if you're so good at getting corrupt people, why didn't you just arrest every congressperson?

342
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:14,909
Speaker 0: Because they're all corrupt.

343
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,248
Speaker 1: Because the congresspeople are the ones...

344
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:18,386
Speaker 0: At least 99% of them are.

345
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,808
Speaker 0: Congresspeople didn't say, "Go start this investigation and arrest

346
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:24,110
Speaker 0: FIFA."

347
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,450
Speaker 0: They're not getting anything from this.

348
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:53,848
Speaker 1: I actually think that this thing is going to be used by people as a campaign thing, because I think people in the US government have realized that, if shows like John Oliver's thing actually do rile people up, if you take the issues that don't affect you or your constituents in any way, and you risk nothing politically by acting on them in some fashion, or at least supporting or saying you support it in some fashion...

349
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,057
Speaker 0: But this is just an action by police.

350
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:59,650
Speaker 0: This is an action by any congressperson.

351
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,292
Speaker 1: Who drove that?

352
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:00,735
Speaker 1: Who started that?

353
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:03,690
Speaker 1: Who's the person who started the investigation?

354
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:06,610
Speaker 0: Pretty sure it's been going on for a while.

355
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:10,629
Speaker 0: Probably going on longer before John Oliver said anything about it.

356
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:10,944
Speaker 0: Maybe.

357
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:12,809
Speaker 0: It takes a long time to build a case like that.

358
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,238
Speaker 1: So let's see who ordered the report.

359
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:16,130
Speaker 1: See who ordered the investigation.

360
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,370
Speaker 0: I mean, someone's going after the congresspeople in New York State, too, right?

361
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,710
Speaker 0: They've had like five corrupt people in a row going down or whatever.

362
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:34,509
Speaker 1: Well, the problem in New York State is that we generally, in the US as a whole, we put the foxes in charge of henhouse security, and then we also put the foxes on the missing chicken investigation committee.

363
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,969
Speaker 0: But it's like someone out there has the capability to find people who are guilty of bribes, corruption, etc.

364
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, Batman.

365
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,036
Speaker 0: And arrest them.

366
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:43,590
Speaker 0: That person just did it.

367
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,370
Speaker 0: So why doesn't that person who arrested FIFA arrest all the congresspeople?

368
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,950
Speaker 1: Because they arrested foreigners and people who don't actually directly contribute to our bribe system.

369
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,889
Speaker 0: But just do it anyway.

370
00:20:56,994 --> 00:21:00,750
Speaker 0: And then, like if I was, say, the Attorney General of the United States, I would do that.

371
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:02,750
Speaker 0: And then I would run for president.

372
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:03,727
Speaker 0: You know what happens, Scott?

373
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,546
Speaker 0: Saying, "I put all the bad congresspeople in jail.

374
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:05,809
Speaker 0: Vote for

375
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:05,890
Speaker 0: me.".

376
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,717
Speaker 1: You're going to run for president?

377
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:08,050
Speaker 1: It's not going to work out like Dave.

378
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,529
Speaker 1: It's going to work out like Bullworth.

379
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:10,470
Speaker 0: That's fine.

380
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,840
Speaker 1: You gotta be a spirit.

381
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:12,750
Speaker 1: You can't be no ghost.

382
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,449
Speaker 0: It'll be awesome.

383
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,890
Speaker 0: Also, you know, even though I would go down, shit would be fixed, because all those corrupt people would be on the not-death row.

384
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,349
Speaker 0: Or they'd be on the death row if they voted for it.

385
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,248
Speaker 1: So one last thing.

386
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:29,149
Speaker 1: If you live in New York, you probably know about Manhattanhenge, and if you don't, you might think this is a cool thing to do.

387
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:30,710
Speaker 0: It's not cool.

388
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:37,350
Speaker 1: There are some times in the year where the sunrise and sunset line up with these avenues on Manhattan Island.

389
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,662
Speaker 0: This happens in other cities as well that have grid-like street structures and also tall buildings.

390
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,370
Speaker 0: The sun will occasionally line up with the road.

391
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,190
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

392
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,608
Speaker 1: Someone noticed this once a long time ago, and people were like, "Ooh,

393
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:53,869
Speaker 1: cool.".

394
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,649
Speaker 1: There's a few places in the city where you can get a really good view.

395
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,025
Speaker 1: People would go and be like, "Oh, that was

396
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:58,269
Speaker 1: cool.".

397
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:00,189
Speaker 1: And then it became an internet thing.

398
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,650
Speaker 1: And now, on those days, if you go to-- It's only twice a year, right?

399
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:03,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

400
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:19,689
Speaker 1: If you go to Tudor City and tried it anywhere near one of those streets on these days, there's a million tourists fucking blocking the street and-- All these photography people lining up with tripods and shit that they don't have permits for.

401
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:20,579
Speaker 0: And you know what?

402
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, occasionally-- Like news trucks, people standing on top of the news truck with cameras.

403
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,030
Speaker 1: Occasionally, you get a really good sunset.

404
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,130
Speaker 0: Twice a year, everyone does this bullshit.

405
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,230
Speaker 1: But it's not better than a normal awesome sunset.

406
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:33,430
Speaker 1: The sunset is not really that different.

407
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:35,170
Speaker 1: So, look at these pictures.

408
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,009
Speaker 1: That is literally the best this event could ever be.

409
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,830
Speaker 1: Never fucking come to this island and try to look at it yourself in person, I swear.

410
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,404
Speaker 0: People are starting to be like, "Oh, go to Queens and look across the whole

411
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:45,866
Speaker 0: island.".

412
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:46,681
Speaker 0: Yeah.

413
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,470
Speaker 0: Why don't you go to Jersey and watch the sun rise?

414
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,248
Speaker 0: No one's doing that.

415
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:51,610
Speaker 0: Right?

416
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you don't want to go to Jersey, do you?

417
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:04,220
Speaker 1: So anyway, things of the day.

418
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:05,659
Speaker 1: Got a thing?

419
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:08,600
Speaker 0: It's the simplest thing, but the quality is so high.

420
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,480
Speaker 0: This man is excellent at imitating various animals.

421
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,480
Speaker 0: Watch this video and listen to him imitate the noises various animals make in an expert fashion.

422
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,959
Speaker 0: I applaud you, good sir.

423
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,560
Speaker 1: I'm glad this man has almost a million views.

424
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,258
Speaker 1: I'm very happy for this man.

425
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,760
Speaker 0: He deserves more than his million views.

426
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,939
Speaker 0: Let's give him some more views.

427
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,540
Speaker 1: So, right now, the Stanley Cup is in its final stages.

428
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:31,800
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

429
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,339
Speaker 0: It's one game away from its final stage.

430
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:36,499
Speaker 1: There is two stages left.

431
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,878
Speaker 0: There's eight stages.

432
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,020
Speaker 0: Final stages.

433
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,619
Speaker 0: Potentially eight stages left.

434
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:49,620
Speaker 1: The next two teams to win a game of hockey go on to the Stanley Cup, and the next team to win five games wins Lord Stanley's Cup.

435
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:58,400
Speaker 1: One of the teams that is do or die in getting into the final four win set is the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.

436
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,113
Speaker 0: Now, you might be thinking, "Hey, we're the Mighty Ducks of

437
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:01,657
Speaker 0: Anaheim.".

438
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:05,998
Speaker 1: So, you might be thinking to yourself, "Hey, wasn't that a Disney

439
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:06,299
Speaker 1: movie?".

440
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:07,919
Speaker 1: It was two Disney movies.

441
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:09,520
Speaker 0: It was more than two, wasn't it?

442
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,619
Speaker 0: Three or four Disney movies?

443
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:11,278
Speaker 1: I don't know.

444
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:12,279
Speaker 0: It was many Disney movies.

445
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,920
Speaker 1: I saw the first two movies in the theater.

446
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:14,958
Speaker 1: I'll say that.

447
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:15,588
Speaker 0: Whoa.

448
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:17,252
Speaker 1: You didn't see D2?

449
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,240
Speaker 0: I saw them at home.

450
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,620
Speaker 1: I saw Mighty Ducks in the theater.

451
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,120
Speaker 0: Blockbuster or some shit.

452
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:29,700
Speaker 1: The plot of D2 is they all forgot how to skate and hockey inexplicably the next year.

453
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:30,438
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

454
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:37,159
Speaker 1: So, you might think like, "Well, wouldn't it be funny if the Ducks of Anaheim were named after the

455
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:37,480
Speaker 1: movie?".

456
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:38,179
Speaker 1: Well, they are.

457
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,679
Speaker 0: They were.

458
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
Speaker 0: They didn't exist until very recently.

459
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,278
Speaker 1: They were created what, '92?

460
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:42,960
Speaker 0: They're owned by Disney.

461
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:43,640
Speaker 0: Disney owns it.

462
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:44,742
Speaker 1: I think '92.

463
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:45,930
Speaker 1: that was set up in the expansion.

464
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, the NHL made expansion teams.

465
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,339
Speaker 0: They said, "Hey, we're making brand new teams.

466
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:51,911
Speaker 0: People can

467
00:24:51,932 --> 00:24:52,097
Speaker 0: buy."

468
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,180
Speaker 0: And Disney bought one and named it the Ducks.

469
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,019
Speaker 1: So, Disney made a hockey team.

470
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,239
Speaker 0: Unapologetically.

471
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,424
Speaker 1: Called the Mighty Ducks.

472
00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:01,072
Speaker 1: that actually had a pretty good mascot, which then they changed it.

473
00:25:01,152 --> 00:25:03,480
Speaker 1: so it's not that awesome Disney mascot they used to have.

474
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:11,000
Speaker 1: But their first game in 1993, the first game that this hockey team played.

475
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,758
Speaker 1: This is a team that has a chance to win Lord Stanley's Cup this year.

476
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:27,040
Speaker 1: Put forth in an actual hockey game on the ice for a live audience for 15 fucking minutes this shameless and ridiculous display.

477
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,200
Speaker 0: It's basically Disney on Ice.

478
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:29,139
Speaker 0: It's Disney on Ice.

479
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,900
Speaker 0: It's right near Disneyland so plenty of performers are available to do this.

480
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,999
Speaker 1: But it's, what's his name?

481
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,560
Speaker 1: The Candelabra from Beauty and the Beast.

482
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:38,400
Speaker 0: That was what was hot at the time.

483
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,175
Speaker 0: Skating around.

484
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,480
Speaker 0: That was what Disney was doing when this team was created.

485
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,080
Speaker 1: They rewrote a bunch of Disney songs to have derpy lyrics about dreams of power plays.

486
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,060
Speaker 0: Because they only bought the team to promote Disney shit.

487
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,860
Speaker 0: They didn't, right?

488
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,019
Speaker 0: That was the original intent.

489
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,340
Speaker 1: Some Gary Glitter and a weird albino guy trying to pump up the crowd.

490
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,580
Speaker 1: And this is amazing to see.

491
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,160
Speaker 1: So Anaheim Mighty Ducks, all I say to you and fans of your team is to remember your shame.

492
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,480
Speaker 0: Well this is why New York sports teams are the best.

493
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,780
Speaker 0: Even ones I hate, like the Yankees, well I guess the Jets are shameless.

494
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:20,720
Speaker 0: But even the Yankees, if you go to a Yankees game, there's no mascots, there's no dancing homo, there's no bullshit.

495
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,139
Speaker 0: You go there and you're there to watch the fucking game.

496
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,760
Speaker 0: You cheer at the game, you boo at the game.

497
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,304
Speaker 1: What about Mr.

498
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:27,131
Speaker 1: Met over at the Mets?

499
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,424
Speaker 1: Mr.

500
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:29,338
Speaker 0: Met is special.

501
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,260
Speaker 0: Even Philadelphia, who I hate the most, the Philly Phanatic, gets an exception as well.

502
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,414
Speaker 0: Because the Philly Phanatic is perhaps, while it pains me to say it, the most talented and quality.

503
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:44,740
Speaker 0: Jim Henson designed mascot.

504
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:46,857
Speaker 0: And most talented, etc.

505
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:48,665
Speaker 0: Except Mr.

506
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:51,100
Speaker 0: Met, who just bashed his head in with a baseball anyway.

507
00:26:54,582 --> 00:27:00,560
Speaker 0: All that kind of performance distraction shit, they call it fan appreciation stuff in the business.

508
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:09,120
Speaker 0: Because you run a sports team, especially a baseball team, people come to your games, they might not be a big, huge fan.

509
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,280
Speaker 0: And baseball is pretty boring, especially compared to other sports.

510
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,400
Speaker 0: They're gonna be pretty bored if all you have is baseball.

511
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:23,060
Speaker 0: So you need all this shit to keep kids entertained, to make it seem like a family-friendly place, and your team is losing and the game is meaningless, why would you come here?

512
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,080
Speaker 0: Kids come with birthday parties, right?

513
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,939
Speaker 0: So you do a bunch of bullshit to spice it up.

514
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,520
Speaker 0: And mostly people do that bullshit at minor league sports.

515
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,140
Speaker 0: Because minor league sports, nobody gives any fucks at all.

516
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,160
Speaker 0: Look at this barren field of fucks that they give.

517
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:39,893
Speaker 0: It is empty, low, right?

518
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,379
Speaker 0: So you need even more fan appreciation shit.

519
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:52,126
Speaker 0: At a New York Rangers game, where every ticket is 100% sold out and costs $1500 because someone cares that much about hockey, you don't gotta do shit.

520
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,178
Speaker 0: No ice girls, no nothing.

521
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,260
Speaker 0: No bands, no mascots, no nonsense.

522
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:01,300
Speaker 0: Just play fucking hockey, we're gonna watch it.

523
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:13,539
Speaker 1: Anyway, to move on, watch this, remember it, and remember that in the modern era, big companies, when they do a thing, we expect really high production values, and we usually get them.

524
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,840
Speaker 1: This has really low production values, and it's from the end of that era.

525
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,200
Speaker 0: The production value looks lower than you think it is, because A, the technology of the 90s is lower.

526
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:25,220
Speaker 1: No, you didn't watch it.

527
00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:27,220
Speaker 0: The camera quality is lower.

528
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,140
Speaker 1: No, forget it, I'm not talking about any of that stuff.

529
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:36,800
Speaker 1: The quality of the skating, the quality of the choreography, on that level, it's really sad.

530
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:43,460
Speaker 1: The albino guy who climbs up on the Zamboni, he kinda can't even do it, and he can barely work up the crowd.

531
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:49,420
Speaker 1: He's not better than the kinds of people who emcee the cosplot at a convention.

532
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,780
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, someone who gets a job doing the, I don't know, what's the bear hoedown thing at Disney World, right?

533
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:02,440
Speaker 0: I mean, that person can sing and dance better than we can, but if they were really good, they wouldn't be there.

534
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they might be on the ice at a hockey game.

535
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:19,800
Speaker 1: Just, in general, when you watch things from the 80s and 90s that were live performances, there's this impression that they did it for the audience at the time and never expected that people would know about or watch it again.

536
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:29,219
Speaker 1: And the science and the craft of making really crass advertising things has gotten way better in the last 20 years.

537
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,559
Speaker 0: Uh, sure, whatever you say.

538
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:36,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, look at the production values of some publicity stunt now compared to one from the 80s or 90s.

539
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,859
Speaker 0: Looks the same crass shit to me.

540
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's more well-crafted crass shit.

541
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,598
Speaker 0: Sure, if you say so.

542
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,128
Speaker 1: It's definitely better done.

543
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,499
Speaker 1: It works better, probably, too.

544
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,414
Speaker 1: In the meantime, we are back on iTunes.

545
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:50,260
Speaker 1: Go subscribe.

546
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:57,802
Speaker 1: Also, review us on iTunes, because the last reviews are from, like, 2006.

547
00:29:57,802 --> 00:29:59,920
Speaker 1: Because no one uses iTunes anymore, apparently.

548
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:02,391
Speaker 0: Alright, well now it is a very important time.

549
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:04,600
Speaker 0: There's a very important meta moment happening, right?

550
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,560
Speaker 0: Our long-running yearly book club episode is happening.

551
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,348
Speaker 1: Wow, yeah, I guess you... God, what book did we read?

552
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,471
Speaker 1: How long has it been?

553
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:14,655
Speaker 1: When did we announce this book?

554
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:16,600
Speaker 1: Like, eight months ago?

555
00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:17,860
Speaker 0: It was too long.

556
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:19,660
Speaker 1: I can find out exactly.

557
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,040
Speaker 0: Well, when we discuss the book, we'll discuss why it took so long to read.

558
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:25,378
Speaker 1: I guess you just can't read?

559
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:36,059
Speaker 1: Okay, September... no, October 20th, 2014 is when we announced this.

560
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:38,926
Speaker 1: So, not a year.

561
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:41,920
Speaker 1: Didn't take a full year for you to read this book about rabbits.

562
00:30:42,765 --> 00:30:43,040
Speaker 0: Okay.

563
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,939
Speaker 1: But it took you a long time, from October to the end of May.

564
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,320
Speaker 0: Now, there are many reasons that it took that long, but I finished it today because I was on vacation.

565
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:53,938
Speaker 1: Great, let's see if I even remember it.

566
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:54,779
Speaker 1: Get this out of the way.

567
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:57,459
Speaker 1: Because I read it, like, a week after we announced it.

568
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,700
Speaker 0: But more importantly, there is the next book club now that you may begin.

569
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:04,760
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

570
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:13,000
Speaker 0: So, I was hanging out in a Barnes & Noble because I had to go to mentoring near Union Square and I had to kill some time between work and... right?

571
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,075
Speaker 0: So, I was walking around the nerd book section, looking at the nerd books.

572
00:31:17,557 --> 00:31:18,219
Speaker 0: You know, like you do.

573
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:19,265
Speaker 0: Not buying any.

574
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:21,200
Speaker 0: Maybe taking a picture of one or two for Amazon.

575
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:21,556
Speaker 0: Yeah.

576
00:31:22,102 --> 00:31:26,176
Speaker 0: I think I saw that Patrick Rothfuss had a new horrible book of some kind.

577
00:31:26,216 --> 00:31:27,440
Speaker 0: I took a picture, sent it to RIM.

578
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:28,651
Speaker 0: Like, "Hey, did you know this

579
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:29,077
Speaker 0: existed?".

580
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:34,760
Speaker 0: And I was looking around and, of course, there's a big old display for the Games of Thrones, right?

581
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:41,619
Speaker 0: And I'm sitting there thinking about the Games of Thrones and I'm like, "Eh, this is really popular lately, but I've known about this way before it was

582
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:42,040
Speaker 0: popular.".

583
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:47,580
Speaker 0: Because I've been hanging out in nerd book sections of borders in Barnes & Noble for, you know, since high school, right?

584
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:57,900
Speaker 0: And there are many, many series of fantasy novels that are in the section of nerd books and sci-fi novels that are ridiculously big and nerds know about them.

585
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:06,400
Speaker 0: But apparently non-nerds didn't know about Games of Thrones until a TV show existed, even though I knew and didn't care about it forever and still don't care about it.

586
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:07,879
Speaker 0: But that's the way it goes.

587
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:16,898
Speaker 0: So then I start looking around and I'm seeing all these other fantasy series that are pretty much in the same spot that Games of Thrones was in before.

588
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:17,780
Speaker 0: there was a TV show.

589
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,784
Speaker 0: Like, I know about it.

590
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:20,647
Speaker 0: I know about it.

591
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:21,970
Speaker 0: All nerds know about it.

592
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:26,120
Speaker 0: It's a big time nerd series, right, that's super famous among nerds.

593
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,204
Speaker 0: But normal people give no fucks.

594
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:29,087
Speaker 0: They don't even know.

595
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:29,668
Speaker 0: it's a thing.

596
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,960
Speaker 0: If a TV show was made about it, it would probably be a big fucking deal, right?

597
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:45,280
Speaker 0: And I'm like, huh, you know what, despite me knowing about most of these fucking things, right, and they're being super notable and whatnot, I really haven't read most of them, right?

598
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,849
Speaker 0: I'm reading Prince of Nothing, which isn't even known among the nerds, right?

599
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:50,593
Speaker 0: I'm not reading, I don't know.

600
00:32:50,613 --> 00:32:53,240
Speaker 0: Alex usually reads most of them, right?

601
00:32:53,861 --> 00:32:56,924
Speaker 0: So then I'm like, well, you know what, I need another book club book.

602
00:32:57,785 --> 00:33:10,380
Speaker 0: What is the biggest and most famous of these that I have not read and as a nerd probably should have read at least some of, at least one page of, right?

603
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,507
Speaker 0: Because, I mean, I've read more than one page of Harry Potter.

604
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:16,600
Speaker 0: That's probably the first one, but that one's known by non-nerds, so it doesn't count, right?

605
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:19,467
Speaker 0: What is the one that is where Game of Thrones was?

606
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:21,171
Speaker 0: Now, I found that one.

607
00:33:21,192 --> 00:33:24,580
Speaker 0: It was very easy to find after walking around for about two seconds.

608
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,435
Speaker 0: And I said, do I really have to, is that, as soon as I saw it, I was like, that's the one.

609
00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:32,180
Speaker 0: There's no question that that's the one.

610
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,900
Speaker 0: But then I looked at it and I said, I really don't want to pick this because it has a problem.

611
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,239
Speaker 1: Uh, what kind of problem does it have?

612
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,050
Speaker 0: It has a problem of many pages.

613
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,700
Speaker 0: The many page problem.

614
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:47,199
Speaker 1: You give me shit about Dumas, you bring this garbage to me?

615
00:33:47,741 --> 00:33:50,171
Speaker 0: It has a Dumas level of pages, in fact.

616
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,160
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's quite Dumas level of pages.

617
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,080
Speaker 0: And I said, man, I really don't want to read that many pages.

618
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,086
Speaker 0: But at the same time, there was an equal force.

619
00:33:58,126 --> 00:34:04,100
Speaker 0: that said, but you're a nerd person, you must know what is written on at least the first book of these pages.

620
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:05,025
Speaker 0: At least.

621
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:06,820
Speaker 0: Otherwise, what kind of nerd are you?

622
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:15,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause I totally in no way regret reading the, uh, Kingkiller Chronicle, Captain Nice Guy's penis adventures through sex land, the fedora legacy.

623
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:23,860
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't matter because if you have not guessed it already, I have selected for whatever consequence may befall me for making the selection.

624
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:24,858
Speaker 1: Hop on pop.

625
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,583
Speaker 0: I'm going to do it anyway.

626
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:32,159
Speaker 0: The book club selection is, dun dun dun dun dun dun, you're going to insert a drum noise?

627
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:42,974
Speaker 0: The first book of Robert Jordan's wheel of time, the eye of the world.

628
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:44,076
Speaker 0: It is 782 pages long.

629
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:50,000
Speaker 0: It is the most famous of nerd book series.

630
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,210
Speaker 1: There's a heron blade.

631
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,159
Speaker 1: I know that.

632
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,973
Speaker 0: I don't know what that is, but I don't care.

633
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:54,880
Speaker 0: Is it like a heron spear?

634
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,560
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about it.

635
00:34:57,941 --> 00:35:00,548
Speaker 1: Here's what I know, Scott.

636
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:04,660
Speaker 1: I do not think you or I will like that book.

637
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,523
Speaker 0: That is fine.

638
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:08,854
Speaker 0: It is so famous and nerdy that it must be done.

639
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,440
Speaker 0: We don't have to read the whole thing.

640
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:19,620
Speaker 1: The rationale for that is that one, most of my friends in high school who really liked this book were insufferable human beings.

641
00:35:19,882 --> 00:35:20,900
Speaker 0: Uh, that's possibly true.

642
00:35:21,401 --> 00:35:27,700
Speaker 1: And the people I knew in high school who were chill told me these books were bullshit and I shouldn't read them.

643
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,295
Speaker 0: I believe it.

644
00:35:29,582 --> 00:35:30,539
Speaker 1: This is what you're doing to me.

645
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,578
Speaker 0: That's what I'm doing.

646
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,780
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure one of our friends was recently talking about like misogyny in these books too.

647
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,465
Speaker 0: I believe it.

648
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:37,860
Speaker 0: Why shouldn't I?

649
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,900
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't see the word misogyny in the Wikipedia page.

650
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,079
Speaker 0: Why shouldn't I believe it?

651
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

652
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,160
Speaker 0: But it is a ridiculously famous and popular series of nerd books.

653
00:35:47,743 --> 00:35:47,944
Speaker 1: Great.

654
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:50,999
Speaker 1: Now we get to learn all about Tellaronryoid.

655
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,245
Speaker 0: We only have to read the first one.

656
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:57,540
Speaker 0: We don't have to read any of the other ones unless for some reason our expectation is different.

657
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,936
Speaker 1: Scott, it's 300 and something pages.

658
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:01,740
Speaker 1: Well, it's book zero.

659
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,428
Speaker 0: Book zero is not the one.

660
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:05,540
Speaker 0: It is book one.

661
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,060
Speaker 0: 782 pages.

662
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,069
Speaker 0: That is the one.

663
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:09,859
Speaker 0: What is the name of it?

664
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,760
Speaker 1: The Eye of the World.

665
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,063
Speaker 0: That's the one.

666
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,960
Speaker 0: It's time to read Wheel of Time.

667
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:24,020
Speaker 1: Scott, I spent my whole life up to this point knowing this book existed and actively avoiding reading it.

668
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,902
Speaker 0: There you go.

669
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:26,249
Speaker 0: That makes it even better.

670
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,460
Speaker 0: We can give Rim a taste of his own medicine.

671
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,020
Speaker 0: What medicine have I, what book have I ever suggested that wasn't good?

672
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,280
Speaker 0: The medicine is Rim finds out that something annoys you and then he repeatedly does it even though you tell him to stop.

673
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,378
Speaker 0: So you're trying to avoid this book, I'll make you read it.

674
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:41,920
Speaker 0: Even though I might have to suffer as well.

675
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,079
Speaker 1: You might indeed because it's been a while since I visited my friend LeCompte.

676
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,437
Speaker 1: LeCompte de Monte Cristo.

677
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:51,420
Speaker 1: And his magical revenge machine.

678
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,360
Speaker 0: And also, we keep picking books for Book Club that we, you know, at least one of us likes, right?

679
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,440
Speaker 0: That has some positive quality to it that is known in advance.

680
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the Kingkiller Chronicle was so positive.

681
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,859
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

682
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,679
Speaker 1: Wait, you picked that one too, right?

683
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,620
Speaker 0: Uh, for a similar reason.

684
00:37:08,002 --> 00:37:10,020
Speaker 1: That reason is not panned out so well.

685
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,824
Speaker 0: No, it hasn't.

686
00:37:10,984 --> 00:37:14,020
Speaker 0: If it doesn't pan out again, it'll be the last time I ever use that reason.

687
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:20,540
Speaker 1: Because the only thing I can say about the Kingkiller Chronicles, had I not read the second book, I would have still thought of it as an okay fantasy book.

688
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,160
Speaker 1: The second one confirmed all my suspicions.

689
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,920
Speaker 0: I bought the second one and didn't read it thanks to your warding away of danger.

690
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,104
Speaker 1: But then you don't see him.

691
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:31,899
Speaker 1: go to the land of the gods and seduce the goddess of sex.

692
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:33,058
Speaker 0: I don't need that.

693
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that is a minor bump on his journey.

694
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:45,240
Speaker 0: Also, I've looked at the covers of these Wheel of Time books, and there are way more dragons and swords and that sort of action.

695
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,960
Speaker 1: They look exactly like the covers to all the Forgotten Realms books.

696
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,180
Speaker 0: Right, kings and wizards and all that good shit.

697
00:37:51,922 --> 00:37:53,919
Speaker 0: So, Kingkiller Chronicles didn't have enough of that.

698
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:54,669
Speaker 1: Yeah.

699
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,700
Speaker 0: It had more wizard school and less kings and emperors and wars and shit.

700
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,968
Speaker 1: What about The Prince of Nothing?

701
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:01,600
Speaker 1: It's just a picture of a guy, usually.

702
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:06,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't have enough wizarding and dragoning either.

703
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,879
Speaker 0: I mean, it has some, but not enough.

704
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:13,760
Speaker 1: A couple days ago, I looked online to see if ArtScout Backer has any progress on the next book.

705
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,400
Speaker 1: And I noticed that someone had linked to me a while ago that there's a wiki about The Prince of Nothing.

706
00:38:19,766 --> 00:38:20,420
Speaker 1: Like, a really good one.

707
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's been there for a long time.

708
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,600
Speaker 1: And I never actually went to it, but they'd warn me, "There's derpy art there, but don't look at

709
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:26,660
Speaker 1: it.".

710
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,214
Speaker 0: There is, yep.

711
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,678
Speaker 1: So, I went there yesterday, and I saw that art.

712
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:34,698
Speaker 1: Oh, my gosh.

713
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,240
Speaker 1: That makes Wesnoth look like a triple-A game.

714
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,440
Speaker 0: Well, Wesnoth has improved a lot since you've played it.

715
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,293
Speaker 1: All right, Wesnoth from the early 2000s.

716
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,473
Speaker 1: Good guy.

717
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:52,080
Speaker 0: All right, so, let's talk about the not watery, the dry up ship.

718
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:52,601
Speaker 1: What?

719
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,165
Speaker 1: Watership down?

720
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,220
Speaker 1: They literally, they get on a ship in the water.

721
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:55,977
Speaker 0: They do.

722
00:38:56,541 --> 00:39:01,520
Speaker 1: That is like, you think, you know, a book that has a name like that, like, you don't really think about it too much.

723
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:06,180
Speaker 1: And then literally, like, the climax of the book is just that.

724
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:06,592
Speaker 0: Yup.

725
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:08,680
Speaker 0: I mean, I saw that coming, anyway.

726
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:12,700
Speaker 1: If you have not listened to the Geek Nights Book Club before, we're going to spoil the book.

727
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,480
Speaker 0: We haven't done one in a while, it's understandable.

728
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,140
Speaker 1: We are assumed, the point of the book club is that you already read the book.

729
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,760
Speaker 0: You've got to be in the club, which means you've read the book.

730
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,880
Speaker 0: If you haven't read the book, you're not in the club, so why are you here?

731
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,680
Speaker 1: So, we're not going to waste any time explaining what happens in the book, telling you who the characters are.

732
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:34,720
Speaker 1: You probably read the book like eight months ago, like I did, and you might forget who Clover was or something.

733
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,040
Speaker 1: But, we're reviewing the book, not the movie, not the TV show.

734
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,099
Speaker 0: I didn't even watch the movie, I didn't even know there was a TV show.

735
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, the movie apparently is really good.

736
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:44,814
Speaker 0: It might be.

737
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:52,720
Speaker 1: It's one of those animated movies that's sitting on the shelf, it's like, Disney playtime, Armageddon, plague dogs, this.

738
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:57,920
Speaker 1: It's one of those movies that parents would get for kids and not realize is actually pretty serious and scary.

739
00:39:58,223 --> 00:39:59,760
Speaker 0: Like Fern Gully, but even more.

740
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,080
Speaker 1: Well, way more.

741
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,900
Speaker 1: I mean, you read this book, like imagine that animated, like all that violence and death.

742
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,578
Speaker 0: Like straight up?

743
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:05,952
Speaker 0: Yeah.

744
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:06,580
Speaker 0: Oh, nice.

745
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:15,260
Speaker 1: In fact, the movie kind of takes it a little more violent and bloody, and you get a lot of animations of Fiverr's terrifying visions.

746
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:24,140
Speaker 1: So, I picked this book, one, because Emily and I have rabbits now, and I know a lot about rabbits that I did not- If you had pet mice, were you going to pick Redwall?

747
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:27,500
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan of- Mouseguard?

748
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:42,919
Speaker 1: The most important thing to think about, why Watership Down I think is interesting to pick as a book club book, and why I think nerds and people in general should read it, is that a lot of people do stories of animals, but they're anthropomorphized- Like Mouseguard.

749
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Mouseguard.

750
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,359
Speaker 0: Not that Mouseguard is bad, it's amazing, but- It is amazing, but there's a lot of that.

751
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,260
Speaker 1: But Watership Down, they're just rabbits.

752
00:40:52,240 --> 00:41:00,040
Speaker 1: Other than making up a drama and dialogue, they don't do anything that rabbits could not do.

753
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:08,110
Speaker 0: Right, this is the thing about this book that I think is the most positive thing about it, is that somehow it has- Who's calling me now?

754
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:09,019
Speaker 0: You can't call me now.

755
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,000
Speaker 0: On the one hand, it's a fantasy novel, right?

756
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:13,120
Speaker 1: Yep, it's a hero's journey.

757
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,719
Speaker 0: It's a straight up fantasy novel.

758
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,500
Speaker 1: Well, it's a hero's journey or a stranger comes to town, depending on what direction you're looking.

759
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:22,640
Speaker 0: It follows the same sort of plot structure of fantasy novel.

760
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:31,360
Speaker 0: There's the kingdoms, and there's wars, and there's adventures, and there's heroes, and battles, and all these kinds of things.

761
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,180
Speaker 0: On the other hand, it's totally straight up real biology of rabbits.

762
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:46,780
Speaker 0: You learn how rabbits actually do, real rabbits actually do in the wild, and they frequently explore and make plot points of true facts about rabbits.

763
00:41:46,920 --> 00:42:08,440
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, rabbits, this is how they make babies, and this is how they eat, and this is the kind of things they like, and only the lady rabbits dig, and a rabbit that was taken care of as a pet is not really good to go out in the wild, and all these things actually matter for the plot, and you learn about rabbits at the same time, and if you already know about rabbits, the fact that those things are true is sort of like, ooh, they incorporated this thing I know.

764
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:10,380
Speaker 1: It also means, it doesn't explain everything.

765
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,039
Speaker 0: Sort of like when you read a book about something involving computers, and the computer parts are actually true, like, ooh, SSH, it's real.

766
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,840
Speaker 1: But also, knowing a lot about rabbits, there's other things you can read into and pick up on that aren't necessarily apparent.

767
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,239
Speaker 1: Lots of neat little stuff.

768
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:36,420
Speaker 1: And it's pretty real, too, like the one rabbit, when they escape on the ship at the end, gets hit on the back just because they go into that bridge, and she just dies because that happens to rabbits.

769
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were going pretty fast in the stormy river.

770
00:42:39,902 --> 00:42:50,640
Speaker 0: I mean, if I was on a boat, think about you're in a little rowboat going down a river, it's raining, it's going kind of fast, there's a bridge, right, you duck, and the top of the bridge hits you in the back, that's gonna hurt like a motherfucker.

771
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,120
Speaker 0: And if you're a little, tiny, weak, tiny rabbit, that's not good.

772
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's interesting, too, how the story has, like, when they're traveling.

773
00:42:59,558 --> 00:43:06,620
Speaker 1: in the beginning, the book does a good job of making it seem like an extreme distance, an extreme amount of time.

774
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,140
Speaker 0: Well, occasionally they reference real locations in the real world.

775
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,959
Speaker 1: Oh, it's set in a real place.

776
00:43:11,161 --> 00:43:17,100
Speaker 0: Right, so if you know those locations, You can go look up a map of, like, Then you'll see exactly how far it is, and it's not that far.

777
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,780
Speaker 1: Like, here's a picture of Nuthanger Farm.

778
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,738
Speaker 0: Like, it's maybe three miles, right?

779
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,520
Speaker 1: That's the farm, right there.

780
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:28,820
Speaker 0: Like, the distance I think, I think I should say in the book, the distance between Watership Down and Efrefras, or whatever it is, is like three miles.

781
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,639
Speaker 0: So, not too far.

782
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:39,496
Speaker 1: It also does a good job of doing the proper noun stuff, because there is a fine line between "here are proper nouns" and...

783
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:43,400
Speaker 0: Okay, well, actually, you know, I mean, it does an okay job, right?

784
00:43:43,763 --> 00:43:44,500
Speaker 0: So, in terms of...

785
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:44,997
Speaker 1: It's not Tolkien.

786
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,740
Speaker 0: Right, in terms of proper nouns, they use proper nouns the way a fantasy novel does, which is cool.

787
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:55,600
Speaker 0: And they also use proper nouns to refer to things that the rabbits see but don't know, right?

788
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:02,199
Speaker 0: So, like, the rabbits don't know what a train is, and they don't know what train tracks are, so that's the iron road, right?

789
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:07,740
Speaker 0: Or, you know, the sun, they don't know about the sun, or the fact that it's a star, right?

790
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,900
Speaker 0: So it's Frith is the sun, right?

791
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,300
Speaker 1: Yep, they have their mythology.

792
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,460
Speaker 0: Right, there's a rabbit mythology, which is awesome.

793
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:24,520
Speaker 0: But, on the other hand, you know, the positive part about that is it brings you into the world of the rabbit, where it's, like, things the rabbits know and things the rabbits don't know, which is good.

794
00:44:25,061 --> 00:44:28,855
Speaker 0: But, when the rabbit says "iron road," well, how does a rabbit know iron?

795
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:30,080
Speaker 0: and has a rabbit know road?

796
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,979
Speaker 0: If you're a pet ant, it's gonna bother you.

797
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, I think that was partly because, like, the author is very open.

798
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:49,800
Speaker 1: Unlike a lot of books we might talk about, the author of Watership Down was 100% open about how the book was written, why he wrote it, who he got to help him do his research, like, when he learned about rabbits, everything.

799
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,940
Speaker 0: So, you can pretty much say-- Wasn't a rabbit person to begin with who knew all this stuff, right?

800
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:00,440
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, he knew a little bit, but he got some people to give him, like, check stuff out-- Feels like a rabbit expert advising, yeah.

801
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,992
Speaker 0: This book was only written in the '70s.

802
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,879
Speaker 0: It wasn't that long ago.

803
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:03,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

804
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:03,939
Speaker 0: It's not that old.

805
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,521
Speaker 1: You know, that's the thing.

806
00:45:04,562 --> 00:45:11,480
Speaker 1: It's not that old, and yet, it seems like a lot of people we know, especially artists, really, really, really strongly remember this book.

807
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:17,920
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I put it on the same level in terms of popularity in our culture as, like, Last Unicorn, right?

808
00:45:18,141 --> 00:45:21,800
Speaker 0: I hear about it pretty much, like, just as often in nerd circles.

809
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:29,540
Speaker 0: So, you know, I sort of pair them together because they both have, you know, animals, and they're both bugs with movies.

810
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,682
Speaker 1: I guess what I thought the language did.

811
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:43,460
Speaker 1: well, like, you're right, the iron thing, but at the same time, the author, like, Richard Adams was really clever in this one point that the whole book is from the perspective of the rabbits, and it's done-- Not the whole book.

812
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, you get-- There are chapters here and there from different perspectives.

813
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:52,509
Speaker 0: You get the outside perspective of, like, what the doctor did at the end and all that, but-- You get other perspectives in a chapter here and there.

814
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:54,596
Speaker 0: Wasn't there a bird chapter also, maybe?

815
00:45:55,117 --> 00:45:55,860
Speaker 0: I'm trying to remember.

816
00:45:56,544 --> 00:45:57,939
Speaker 1: Do you remember any character's names?

817
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,060
Speaker 1: I'm curious about that because you just read this book.

818
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,600
Speaker 0: I remember-- Well, yeah, I just read it today.

819
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:02,739
Speaker 0: I read it eight months ago.

820
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:10,820
Speaker 0: I mean, most of the character's names are, like, not human names, like, Hazel's the main rabbit, and then, like, the thing is, some characters have multiple names, right?

821
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:17,240
Speaker 0: Like, Bigwig, he has, like, two other names that he has, right, which sort of also mean the same thing, you know?

822
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:33,420
Speaker 0: So it's, like, characters in multiple names, and then there's the best character, which is the, basically, Rabbit Moses, or Rabbit Hercules, or Rabbit King David, which is L-R-I-R-R-I-R-A, who's the best dude.

823
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:35,032
Speaker 0: Really, I just wanted to hear about him.

824
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:36,040
Speaker 0: I didn't care about the other rabbit.

825
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:42,420
Speaker 1: Well, you did hear about him because the whole story is the creation of another myth of L-R-I-R-R-A.

826
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,119
Speaker 0: Obviously.

827
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:43,943
Speaker 1: Emily yells at me.

828
00:46:44,487 --> 00:46:46,399
Speaker 1: I pronounce that differently every time I look at it.

829
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:54,320
Speaker 0: Well, okay, so if you look in the book, right, his name is basically, like, he is hated by the thousand, right?

830
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:59,520
Speaker 0: So, for example, the rabbits will often end each other's names with Ra, right?

831
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,620
Speaker 0: So, like, Hazel, they'll call other rabbits will be, like, Hazel Ra, right?

832
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,075
Speaker 0: So L-R-I-R-I-R-A, they end it with Ra, right?

833
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,079
Speaker 0: So Ra goes at the end.

834
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:13,700
Speaker 0: Elil is the word they use to refer to the thousand enemies of rabbits, right?

835
00:47:14,561 --> 00:47:18,780
Speaker 0: And the middle part, the Arara part, it means thousand, right?

836
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,640
Speaker 0: So it's like, oh no, they're hated, I think, whatever.

837
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:28,140
Speaker 0: So it's like Elil, right, Herrera, Ra, so something like that.

838
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:35,000
Speaker 0: It's a combination of three words together fast, so it's hard to say, and the way they spell it is not make it easy.

839
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:44,080
Speaker 1: But notice the structure of how we've got the story of, like, a clever rabbit who sort of picked up on something being wrong and decided to go do something different.

840
00:47:44,401 --> 00:47:45,020
Speaker 0: That clever rabbit.

841
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:52,177
Speaker 0: Because that's where a lot of the rabbit stories that are in this book are really just rabbits.

842
00:47:52,217 --> 00:47:55,020
Speaker 0: so clever, and that's the best part, because it's like Bugs Bunny.

843
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,444
Speaker 0: But then look at what the story is.

844
00:47:56,504 --> 00:48:02,520
Speaker 1: The stories all kind of blur together, and it's like this historical spoken word narrative.

845
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,380
Speaker 0: Prince Rainbow.

846
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:13,080
Speaker 1: So you've got this cycle of history, this oration, this oratory history that they pass down, you know, rabbit to rabbit over time.

847
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,858
Speaker 1: They don't write things down, except for the cult rabbits a little bit.

848
00:48:18,203 --> 00:48:25,540
Speaker 1: So Fiverr and Hazel together, especially Hazel, Hazel does clever things and totally wins in the end.

849
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:31,880
Speaker 1: And you see that he's inspired by these stories that their storyteller tells and that he knows and remembered by heart.

850
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:38,620
Speaker 1: But at the same time, it's pretty obvious that rabbits have very short lives, and he lived way longer than most rabbits in the end.

851
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,720
Speaker 1: And individual rabbits get forgotten very quickly.

852
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,620
Speaker 0: They don't have writing, they only have an oral tradition.

853
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:51,120
Speaker 0: So it's making a big statement about what humanity was like when we only had an oral tradition, right?

854
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:59,620
Speaker 0: All the clever rabbits that have ever existed, basically all their stories get exaggerated, simplified, and they basically all just become El Harira, whatever.

855
00:49:00,843 --> 00:49:02,008
Speaker 0: No one's going to remember Hazel.

856
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:04,500
Speaker 0: All the stories of Hazel are going to be stories of El Harira.

857
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,445
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

858
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:07,320
Speaker 1: So every clever rabbit becomes El Harira.

859
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,280
Speaker 0: That I'm going to pronounce differently every single time.

860
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:12,654
Speaker 1: But also, it was done very cleverly.

861
00:49:12,714 --> 00:49:15,960
Speaker 1: So all the stories... You know how we anthropomorphize animals?

862
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:22,220
Speaker 1: I'm amazed that Adams was able to lapinomorphize other stuff.

863
00:49:22,722 --> 00:49:26,399
Speaker 1: Remember the story about the king who was evil or whatever?

864
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,560
Speaker 1: And how he had all the lettuces and how the lettuces were the important treasure?

865
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,780
Speaker 1: It's like the rabbits describe what other people do in rabbit terms.

866
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,352
Speaker 1: Like lettuces, of course, that's the valuable thing.

867
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:37,915
Speaker 1: Not gold.

868
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:38,759
Speaker 1: Lettuces.

869
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,960
Speaker 0: What does gold do to a rabbit?

870
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,994
Speaker 1: That's like us and Redwall, the mice stealing gold from something.

871
00:49:44,035 --> 00:49:45,360
Speaker 1: We anthropomorphize them.

872
00:49:46,323 --> 00:49:52,440
Speaker 1: But Adams so consistently kept that perspective when he was looking through the eyes of the rabbits.

873
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:59,100
Speaker 1: I was really surprised by how cleverly and well done that specific aspect was.

874
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,260
Speaker 1: Everything was in terms of rabbits.

875
00:50:04,063 --> 00:50:04,264
Speaker 0: Yep.

876
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:08,940
Speaker 0: So the reason it took me so long to read this book is because, A, shit was going down.

877
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,439
Speaker 1: For eight months.

878
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,343
Speaker 0: For a long time.

879
00:50:11,363 --> 00:50:14,800
Speaker 0: So I didn't have a lot of time for reading or ways to prioritize reading.

880
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:27,840
Speaker 0: But more so, it's like while the book is not bad, it is good, there are many things I like about it, it lacked that thing that other books have where you read it and you just need to keep reading.

881
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,451
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

882
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:28,820
Speaker 0: Right?

883
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:41,359
Speaker 0: It's like if I get a Prince of Nothing book, at least all the ones so far, you read some and it's like, even though you know you're going to fall asleep and close your eyes in this chapter and you're not going to be able to finish it, you can't help but continue reading.

884
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:46,240
Speaker 0: This book, I would read a chapter and I'd be like, while I was reading it, I'd be like, alright, alright.

885
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,859
Speaker 0: I wasn't upset or being like, this sucks, I hate this.

886
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,200
Speaker 0: But I'd close my Kindle and put it there and there would be no urge to go pick it up again.

887
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:01,060
Speaker 0: There would be no, like, when I got in bed the next day, I just completely forgot about it.

888
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,819
Speaker 0: I'd just grab my DS instead or something.

889
00:51:03,443 --> 00:51:05,319
Speaker 1: It didn't have the grabbyness.

890
00:51:05,744 --> 00:51:06,340
Speaker 1: One, I have rabbits.

891
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,340
Speaker 0: Because I didn't care too much about the characters.

892
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:18,400
Speaker 1: One of our rabbits, I think of him a lot like Hazel because Moogie, the brown one, he's sort of like cautious but also clever.

893
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:29,080
Speaker 1: So he's the one where in the morning, I go out to get lettuces and things, and he'll be hiding near the door to be ready to sneak out into the hall.

894
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,900
Speaker 1: He's always trying to bust into stuff and get into things and mess around.

895
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:33,979
Speaker 1: So rabbits do.

896
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:38,800
Speaker 1: So I was reading the book and I look up and I got a little rabbit right there doing rabbit-y things.

897
00:51:40,023 --> 00:51:41,880
Speaker 1: So I think that pushed me to just read a lot faster.

898
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,171
Speaker 1: And two, the book's a really fast read.

899
00:51:44,191 --> 00:51:45,860
Speaker 1: so I read the whole thing in a few days.

900
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,422
Speaker 0: I mean, I did.

901
00:51:46,462 --> 00:51:50,119
Speaker 0: I pretty much read probably the last 80% of the book yesterday and today.

902
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:54,820
Speaker 0: Well, maybe 60% but still, yeah, it's a very fast read.

903
00:51:55,842 --> 00:52:04,940
Speaker 0: But whenever I got to the parts where they were telling a story about El Herrera and the cabbages and whatever, that part was a part that was very grabby.

904
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,400
Speaker 0: I had to keep reading and I basically never stopped in the middle of any of those stories.

905
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:15,519
Speaker 0: But I stopped reading, you know, pausing in the parts about the regular rabbits because I just didn't care about them that much.

906
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,600
Speaker 0: You know, often, they pretty much really had three different stories sort of stuck together.

907
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,780
Speaker 0: You know, the first story was escaping from the village where they sense danger.

908
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,546
Speaker 0: The village.

909
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:27,879
Speaker 0: I don't know.

910
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,192
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Warren where they sense danger.

911
00:52:30,212 --> 00:52:31,160
Speaker 0: That was story one.

912
00:52:31,642 --> 00:52:36,578
Speaker 0: Story two was the cult rabbits and story three was battling with the fascist rabbits.

913
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,384
Speaker 1: But see, there was no break in those.

914
00:52:38,404 --> 00:52:42,019
Speaker 1: I don't think of them as separate stories because also the book did a really good job of...

915
00:52:43,021 --> 00:52:45,700
Speaker 0: You could have divided the book into like part one, part two, part three.

916
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,280
Speaker 1: No, but here's why it didn't and why it works better that way.

917
00:52:49,222 --> 00:52:54,060
Speaker 1: They didn't go that far and their journey was sort of this continuous journey.

918
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,480
Speaker 1: So there is no destination in a typical human hero story.

919
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,160
Speaker 1: Like the slog, you know, the knee that breaks pulls ten men down.

920
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,767
Speaker 1: They have a destination.

921
00:53:03,787 --> 00:53:05,194
Speaker 1: They're going to the coffers.

922
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:06,280
Speaker 1: That's their goal.

923
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:10,288
Speaker 1: There was no like place to get to.

924
00:53:10,468 --> 00:53:11,150
Speaker 1: There was just.

925
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:14,960
Speaker 1: now we're safe and we can eat things and not be as worried.

926
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:20,500
Speaker 1: But at the same time, it's not like they thought of it from the same perspective of this is our new home.

927
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:21,970
Speaker 1: We're safe here now.

928
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:23,280
Speaker 1: They just kept rabbiting.

929
00:53:23,721 --> 00:53:32,259
Speaker 1: So in the course of rabbiting, all these stories keep happening because there is literally no way to settle down unless you become one of these messed up warrens.

930
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:46,000
Speaker 0: But yeah, each of those three stories, though, was basically akin to like a sort of animal farm, Lord of the Flies, social commentary kind of aspect.

931
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:50,440
Speaker 0: And that part is sort of like, yeah, I've read these stories like a hundred times before.

932
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,647
Speaker 1: But one, the author said that wasn't the case at all.

933
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:53,610
Speaker 1: It was just an exploration.

934
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:56,480
Speaker 1: Like there was no allegory or metaphor or anything.

935
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,479
Speaker 0: Well, you failed at doing what you said you were doing.

936
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:05,260
Speaker 1: No, because I think it was like, well, what would rabbits be like if this happened?

937
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,662
Speaker 1: What would rabbits be like?

938
00:54:06,722 --> 00:54:08,127
Speaker 1: Like, you know, the cult rabbits.

939
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:12,640
Speaker 1: What are wild rabbits that are that don't have to worry about food anymore?

940
00:54:13,423 --> 00:54:14,186
Speaker 0: What would they do?

941
00:54:14,347 --> 00:54:17,420
Speaker 1: So they start developing writing and art and culture.

942
00:54:18,003 --> 00:54:18,285
Speaker 0: Right.

943
00:54:18,346 --> 00:54:20,020
Speaker 1: So at the same time, they get kind of messed up.

944
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:26,500
Speaker 0: In a rabbit warren, the term they used for basically like the, you know, the army was like the Ausla.

945
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,161
Speaker 1: Right.

946
00:54:27,482 --> 00:54:32,880
Speaker 0: But in the fascist rabbit colony, they had the secret rabbit police, which were the Auslafel.

947
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,362
Speaker 1: Yeah.

948
00:54:33,443 --> 00:54:36,058
Speaker 0: That doesn't sound like a Nazi term to you.

949
00:54:36,924 --> 00:54:37,439
Speaker 1: Not really.

950
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,860
Speaker 1: So Richard Adams talked about how the rabbit language.

951
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:49,560
Speaker 1: He made it up to be very huffy and like the kinds of noises and things that he associated with rabbits.

952
00:54:49,821 --> 00:54:53,020
Speaker 1: And that is purely the sole reason the language sounds the way it does.

953
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:58,820
Speaker 0: That's why you don't want if you don't want to make a metaphor for something, you should go out of your way to make it as far away as possible.

954
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:05,960
Speaker 1: Plus, I mean, yeah, pretty much any fascism at all will be able to be read as a metaphor for Nazis.

955
00:55:06,182 --> 00:55:08,339
Speaker 1: Obviously, that's just how it goes.

956
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:17,980
Speaker 1: But at the same time that Warren was very successful, except for the fact that Woundwort was fucking crazy.

957
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,180
Speaker 0: I mean, that's interesting about that character, right?

958
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:30,320
Speaker 0: Because at the same time as him being crazy, it like they took care to not just show him as like crazy evil bad guy.

959
00:55:30,521 --> 00:55:30,703
Speaker 0: Right.

960
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:32,960
Speaker 0: It's like he had a lot of positive qualities.

961
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,260
Speaker 1: Oh, he was also a product of his upbringing.

962
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:35,822
Speaker 0: Yeah.

963
00:55:36,244 --> 00:55:37,027
Speaker 0: But it's like he had so many.

964
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,914
Speaker 0: it's like, yeah, he's a bad ass.

965
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:40,360
Speaker 0: He totally saved everybody.

966
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,380
Speaker 0: You know, it's like he has many good qualities.

967
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,520
Speaker 0: But because he was basically he just took it too far.

968
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,140
Speaker 1: Well, he was basically not a rabbit.

969
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:48,441
Speaker 0: Right.

970
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:51,619
Speaker 0: And even when he had the chance at towards the end.

971
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:52,144
Speaker 0: Right.

972
00:55:52,164 --> 00:55:53,699
Speaker 0: Where Hazel was like, let's make a deal.

973
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:54,422
Speaker 0: Right.

974
00:55:54,442 --> 00:55:57,580
Speaker 0: We'll just send some of your people, make a new war and out in the middle part.

975
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:00,119
Speaker 0: He almost went with it.

976
00:56:00,362 --> 00:56:00,489
Speaker 1: Yeah.

977
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,980
Speaker 0: You know, but then he didn't because he was too far gone.

978
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:07,019
Speaker 0: But if that had been a younger, you know, of him, he might have said yes.

979
00:56:07,702 --> 00:56:10,399
Speaker 1: But like, you know, when I'm reading, I was getting like that big scene at the end.

980
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:11,869
Speaker 1: I like Kihar a lot.

981
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,539
Speaker 1: And when they're like, when Kihar is helping him out.

982
00:56:13,942 --> 00:56:14,378
Speaker 0: Bird is so good.

983
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:14,846
Speaker 1: Yeah.

984
00:56:14,867 --> 00:56:15,054
Speaker 1: Yeah.

985
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:15,641
Speaker 1: You get.

986
00:56:16,102 --> 00:56:17,607
Speaker 1: I would if I was going to ship like.

987
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:22,460
Speaker 1: I think I feel like Bigwig had a weird crush on Kihar because the other rabbits get making fun of him.

988
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:24,740
Speaker 1: Like you really like that bird a lot.

989
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,179
Speaker 1: Why are you hanging out with him so much?

990
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,854
Speaker 0: He was the one who was friends with the bird.

991
00:56:27,915 --> 00:56:28,380
Speaker 0: What's the problem?

992
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:28,721
Speaker 1: Yeah.

993
00:56:29,103 --> 00:56:31,760
Speaker 1: But he was the one who was so skeptical of the bird in the beginning, too.

994
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:32,816
Speaker 0: That's always how it is.

995
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,817
Speaker 0: It's always how it is.

996
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:36,779
Speaker 1: But then there were other little touches like that, too.

997
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,839
Speaker 1: Like when they were moving, when they're on their way, like they had the fight with the rats at one point.

998
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:48,380
Speaker 1: But at the same time later, like it implies that like rats have a similar thing going on and they can kind of communicate.

999
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,132
Speaker 1: Because remember when?

1000
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:50,980
Speaker 1: what's his name?

1001
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:55,260
Speaker 1: I forget who was trying to get the dog to chase them back to the war.

1002
00:56:56,481 --> 00:57:00,860
Speaker 1: He runs and hides in the barn and the dogs coming after him and the rats are like, just lay low.

1003
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,564
Speaker 1: It's cool, dude.

1004
00:57:01,866 --> 00:57:03,293
Speaker 1: And he's like, no, I need the dog to chase me.

1005
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:04,359
Speaker 1: The rats like, what the fuck?

1006
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,317
Speaker 0: What the fuck is wrong with you?

1007
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:06,806
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1008
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:07,580
Speaker 0: One another thing.

1009
00:57:07,922 --> 00:57:09,090
Speaker 1: It's just a bird.

1010
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:10,660
Speaker 1: It's just a dog.

1011
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,160
Speaker 1: And he fucking turns around and tries to fight that dog.

1012
00:57:13,581 --> 00:57:18,640
Speaker 1: And we know as humans that the dog just ate him and walked away with his body like, duh.

1013
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,680
Speaker 0: But probably took it back to the farm.

1014
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,041
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1015
00:57:21,363 --> 00:57:25,300
Speaker 1: But I love how like they never found his body.

1016
00:57:25,461 --> 00:57:27,980
Speaker 1: So he also lives on forever.

1017
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:28,620
Speaker 0: Sure.

1018
00:57:29,902 --> 00:57:34,277
Speaker 0: You know, there was one thing in this book is there was a Chekhov's gun, which is the little mouse.

1019
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:35,060
Speaker 0: they befriended, right?

1020
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,480
Speaker 0: Because they befriended the mouse and then they befriended the bird.

1021
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,120
Speaker 0: And the bird basically Chekhov's gun went bam right away.

1022
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,339
Speaker 0: It's like, well, this bird is basically a character now that's hanging out with you all the time.

1023
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,693
Speaker 0: But the mouse was like, it's going to come back later.

1024
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:47,596
Speaker 0: It's Chekhov's gun.

1025
00:57:47,616 --> 00:57:48,480
Speaker 0: It hasn't fired yet.

1026
00:57:48,721 --> 00:57:53,300
Speaker 0: And when it fired, it did fire, but it sort of fired meekly, which I was surprised.

1027
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,278
Speaker 1: Well, it's a mouse.

1028
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:55,803
Speaker 0: Right.

1029
00:57:55,844 --> 00:57:57,006
Speaker 0: The mouse is just sort of like.

1030
00:57:57,167 --> 00:58:02,580
Speaker 0: all he did in the end was warn them of a danger over the hill, which was significant, quite significant.

1031
00:58:03,081 --> 00:58:09,260
Speaker 0: But it wasn't like I expected like a whole bunch of little miceys to come out and get all over, you know, the bad guys or something like that.

1032
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:14,900
Speaker 1: I guess what's interesting is that the book kind of does it, you know, nerds like world building a lot.

1033
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,229
Speaker 1: And there is a lot of world building.

1034
00:58:16,249 --> 00:58:17,980
Speaker 1: It's like rabbit society world building.

1035
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,120
Speaker 1: You get a lot of this like sense of a world the way rabbits are and everything.

1036
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:28,320
Speaker 1: But at the same time, nerds like world building where they wanted to be, quote unquote, realistic, like plausible.

1037
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,520
Speaker 1: It has to fit like, why would that Game of Thrones character do this?

1038
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,028
Speaker 1: Obviously, he just murdered them all.

1039
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,040
Speaker 1: And they love it when that kind of stuff happens.

1040
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:42,720
Speaker 1: So the fact that the mice couldn't play a bigger role sort of fits with the fact that everything is plausible.

1041
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:49,560
Speaker 0: I mean, the craziest thing that happens is when getting in a boat and realizing they should bite the rope off.

1042
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:50,723
Speaker 1: Like, well, that was clever.

1043
00:58:50,743 --> 00:58:57,540
Speaker 1: I'm talking about in the end where Fiverr is like, you know, I had a dream that like you rode one of those Haruda dues and I came back to the farm, whatever.

1044
00:58:58,002 --> 00:59:01,159
Speaker 1: And then like that happens because the little girl just picks him up and like, OK.

1045
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like how sometimes he uses when he makes a proper noun like her to do.

1046
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:08,500
Speaker 0: It's like you and any human being immediately knows they're talking about a car.

1047
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:09,142
Speaker 0: Right.

1048
00:59:09,423 --> 00:59:11,411
Speaker 0: Because it sounds like a car.

1049
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:13,660
Speaker 0: It's an onomatopoeia kind of situation.

1050
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:16,900
Speaker 0: But some of the other proper nouns, they didn't do that.

1051
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,241
Speaker 0: Right.

1052
00:59:17,301 --> 00:59:22,740
Speaker 0: Like if you don't know that Frith is the sun, it's going to take you a while to figure it out pretty quick.

1053
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,214
Speaker 0: But it's not as obvious as who to do as a car.

1054
00:59:25,435 --> 00:59:26,200
Speaker 0: You see what I'm saying?

1055
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:31,540
Speaker 0: There's no sort of this connection between the rabbit language and the human language.

1056
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,240
Speaker 1: But like the Prince of Nothing, where there's also no connection, it uses all those things consistently.

1057
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:43,720
Speaker 1: And like when the rabbits have the different names for each other, it's like they're they're used consistently and they sort of just feel natural.

1058
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:47,940
Speaker 1: It's the opposite of the the Rothfussian model.

1059
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,767
Speaker 0: Yep.

1060
00:59:49,888 --> 00:59:51,980
Speaker 0: Is there anything else to say about this book?

1061
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,984
Speaker 1: I mean, I think it's definitely worth reading.

1062
00:59:54,044 --> 01:00:00,920
Speaker 1: I don't I get the impression that nothing else related to the book is worth pursuing except the movie.

1063
01:00:01,441 --> 01:00:04,680
Speaker 1: Like, I guess the continuing adventures or whatever are pretty rubbish.

1064
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:08,688
Speaker 0: I mean, like, would I?

1065
01:00:08,868 --> 01:00:09,249
Speaker 0: it's not like.

1066
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:14,280
Speaker 0: I want to go back and unread it, but it's not like I would have regretted not reading it.

1067
01:00:14,642 --> 01:00:16,199
Speaker 1: I like this book a lot more than you did.

1068
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:16,600
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1069
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:20,475
Speaker 0: I mean, it's good, but it's not like it's not going to go on a favorite books list.

1070
01:00:20,556 --> 01:00:21,620
Speaker 0: I'm not going to read it again.

1071
01:00:22,322 --> 01:00:22,908
Speaker 1: I'll put it up there.

1072
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:24,060
Speaker 1: I could read it again someday.

1073
01:00:24,562 --> 01:00:25,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think so.

1074
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,094
Speaker 1: I definitely could.

1075
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,038
Speaker 0: You can do that.

1076
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:35,110
Speaker 1: I also like the implications, especially around the cult rabbits, like just the little things like the.

1077
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:40,840
Speaker 1: you know, you were talking about allegory for the advancement of humans, like from an oral tradition and those sorts of things like what humans were like.

1078
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,824
Speaker 1: Look at what happened to the cult rabbits.

1079
01:00:42,844 --> 01:00:49,080
Speaker 1: They started making a little bit of art and stuff and they made a weird warrant and they made a social warrant.

1080
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:51,320
Speaker 1: And these rabbits did not understand.

1081
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,224
Speaker 1: Like, I like that.

1082
01:00:52,245 --> 01:00:55,300
Speaker 1: No, they lived like the Hazel could not understand.

1083
01:00:55,841 --> 01:01:01,260
Speaker 1: Like he knew there was something important about the things they pressed into the walls, but he didn't get it.

1084
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,117
Speaker 1: Like he didn't he couldn't figure it out.

1085
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:07,520
Speaker 1: No, a worse author would have made that happen more.

1086
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:16,800
Speaker 1: But then they get the idea and their war and like they advance, like they civilize a little bit, like they make the bigger war and like you see them evolve.

1087
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,320
Speaker 0: They made the honeycomb part.

1088
01:01:18,562 --> 01:01:20,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, that they wouldn't have otherwise done.

1089
01:01:20,701 --> 01:01:23,859
Speaker 0: They're like, oh, that's a good idea from them, but we don't need to bother anything else from them.

1090
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,225
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they're weird.

1091
01:01:25,445 --> 01:01:29,220
Speaker 0: But in general, I like this part of the thing they did in all the things they figure out.

1092
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,289
Speaker 0: They also bother stuff from the fascists, too.

1093
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:31,570
Speaker 0: Right.

1094
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:33,639
Speaker 0: They start sending the patrols out a little bit.

1095
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:33,840
Speaker 0: Right.

1096
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:35,278
Speaker 0: Just for whatever reason, you know.

1097
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:44,880
Speaker 1: But it did a good job of letting them figure that stuff out and use it and evolve a little bit, but not figure it out too much to where it's not.

1098
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,026
Speaker 1: Like, oh, what's his name?

1099
01:01:49,066 --> 01:01:50,549
Speaker 1: The smart one.

1100
01:01:51,992 --> 01:01:52,854
Speaker 1: Who's the smart one?

1101
01:01:52,874 --> 01:01:55,620
Speaker 1: The guy who figured the one who figures out the rope because he's looking at the boat.

1102
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,940
Speaker 1: He's like, I think like he's looking at it.

1103
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's what I want to point out.

1104
01:02:01,445 --> 01:02:01,626
Speaker 0: Right.

1105
01:02:01,686 --> 01:02:03,212
Speaker 0: So there's like the main rabbits, right?

1106
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:05,080
Speaker 0: This hazel, bigwig, fiver.

1107
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:05,582
Speaker 0: Right.

1108
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:08,180
Speaker 0: It's like the ones that, you know, that are really significant.

1109
01:02:08,441 --> 01:02:14,200
Speaker 0: There seem to be a lot of rabbits that are sort of less significant, but still sort of important.

1110
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:18,894
Speaker 0: Like, I think there's like strawberry and some of these other ones.

1111
01:02:18,934 --> 01:02:19,115
Speaker 0: Right.

1112
01:02:19,155 --> 01:02:20,679
Speaker 0: But it's like you really can't.

1113
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,007
Speaker 0: It's hard to tell them apart.

1114
01:02:22,028 --> 01:02:23,579
Speaker 0: Like they're basically all the same rabbit to me.

1115
01:02:24,123 --> 01:02:24,728
Speaker 1: No, they all do.

1116
01:02:24,748 --> 01:02:26,360
Speaker 1: Most of them have pretty different personalities.

1117
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,284
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like they they were there.

1118
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:33,920
Speaker 0: like like they didn't develop or focus on them enough for me to remember like which one was which.

1119
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,540
Speaker 0: It's like all I knew is whenever I saw one of those names, I'm like, oh, that's one of the names of one of the secondary second tier rabbits.

1120
01:02:41,062 --> 01:02:43,920
Speaker 1: I remember them because they all had a role in the party like this one's the bard.

1121
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, I couldn't remember what their roles were.

1122
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:48,900
Speaker 0: I saw they were all just second tier rabbit to me.

1123
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,160
Speaker 1: I'm curious because so like Holly, second tier rabbit and the prince of nothing.

1124
01:02:55,161 --> 01:02:59,296
Speaker 1: What is the name of I don't know, any of the great names?

1125
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:00,240
Speaker 1: Anyone?

1126
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:01,364
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

1127
01:03:01,765 --> 01:03:06,080
Speaker 1: What is the name of the magic that the the the other people use, the Phantom?

1128
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:10,052
Speaker 0: Oh, I used to know.

1129
01:03:10,132 --> 01:03:10,858
Speaker 0: It's been a long time.

1130
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:11,039
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1131
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:16,740
Speaker 1: Name any characters other than Hazel and Fiverr and Bigwig.

1132
01:03:17,843 --> 01:03:18,630
Speaker 0: I just said Holly.

1133
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:18,993
Speaker 0: That's it.

1134
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:19,840
Speaker 1: That's a rabbit.

1135
01:03:21,242 --> 01:03:27,640
Speaker 1: You don't remember the name of the badass that came that was in basically in Irons that came out of her Fafero with them?

1136
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,109
Speaker 0: Oh, what's that guy's name?

1137
01:03:29,129 --> 01:03:29,833
Speaker 0: That guy's so awesome.

1138
01:03:31,903 --> 01:03:32,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was.

1139
01:03:33,007 --> 01:03:36,840
Speaker 0: I thought that Campione guy whose name was obviously should have just been championed.

1140
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:42,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought he was going to like, you know, do a trader situation and turn on the the work guy.

1141
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:43,424
Speaker 0: But he didn't.

1142
01:03:44,008 --> 01:03:45,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he still was OK in the end.

1143
01:03:46,362 --> 01:03:49,420
Speaker 0: I thought he was going to go full turncoat and help the good guys.

1144
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:58,680
Speaker 1: Instead, he kind of backs off into like, let's just keep doing the smart stuff we're doing, but let the other people just leave because otherwise it's not working out.

1145
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:09,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I but I did also enjoy how the characters were all like, no character did any of the stupid things that bother me in a lot of books or a lot of stories.

1146
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,002
Speaker 0: That's true.

1147
01:04:10,423 --> 01:04:20,280
Speaker 1: When I first started reading, my immediate fear was that the initial plot was going to be Bigwig still wants to be like an important big boss rabbit and he bosses Hazel around.

1148
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,164
Speaker 1: And that's a conflict.

1149
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:24,380
Speaker 1: I like how it skipped that a hundred percent.

1150
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:25,724
Speaker 0: I mean, it's the same thing.

1151
01:04:25,744 --> 01:04:29,160
Speaker 0: Like people didn't trust fibers, crazy ramblings until they saw that they were true.

1152
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,105
Speaker 0: Then they trusted them.

1153
01:04:30,146 --> 01:04:30,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

1154
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:31,736
Speaker 0: And then it's OK.

1155
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:32,320
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1156
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,227
Speaker 0: Everyone had the rabbits.

1157
01:04:34,247 --> 01:04:42,000
Speaker 0: This is why the main characters that why you were rooting for them, because like they were the smart, common sense ones who listen to reason and had reason.

1158
01:04:43,303 --> 01:04:44,888
Speaker 0: And that's why they were the tricky rabbits.

1159
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:45,148
Speaker 0: Right.

1160
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:48,720
Speaker 0: They were clever and and, you know, smarter than the other ones.

1161
01:04:48,981 --> 01:04:49,182
Speaker 1: Yep.

1162
01:04:49,403 --> 01:04:52,360
Speaker 0: Whereas all the other ones were, you know, messed up in some way.

1163
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:57,900
Speaker 1: And it all fits with what real rabbits are like, because the way rabbits work is that they make a lot of them.

1164
01:04:58,422 --> 01:05:01,299
Speaker 1: And only the lucky and clever ones keep making more of them.

1165
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,400
Speaker 1: So they sort of evolved toward always being clever and making more of themselves as fast as possible.

1166
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:10,959
Speaker 1: And the story sort of just like set around all that.

1167
01:05:11,601 --> 01:05:21,599
Speaker 0: Well, also because rabbits are that way in the real world that we live in, where people write stories about rabbits and they're, you know, they will often lead to a rabbit as a tricky character.

1168
01:05:22,261 --> 01:05:22,682
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1169
01:05:22,702 --> 01:05:29,180
Speaker 0: Same way that you will lean is like, you know, if you were making something about like a loyal army of something, you would pick dogs.

1170
01:05:29,601 --> 01:05:30,083
Speaker 0: Right.

1171
01:05:30,123 --> 01:05:31,349
Speaker 0: You know, stuff like that.

1172
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,354
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1173
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:33,480
Speaker 1: I really like this book.

1174
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,200
Speaker 0: People make like, you know, people make like the wise old God whale.

1175
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,951
Speaker 0: No one makes the wise old God starfish.

1176
01:05:41,277 --> 01:05:41,979
Speaker 0: That doesn't happen.

1177
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:43,519
Speaker 0: What about boa juice?

1178
01:05:45,481 --> 01:05:46,504
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, right?

1179
01:05:46,966 --> 01:05:51,400
Speaker 0: It's like different animals in the real world have different personalities and traits.

1180
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,560
Speaker 0: So that when stories are written, people pick animals to go with matching traits.

1181
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,247
Speaker 0: You don't see mismatches like that.

1182
01:05:57,307 --> 01:06:00,520
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, I don't know, grasshopper guard.

1183
01:06:00,902 --> 01:06:01,328
Speaker 0: Okay.

1184
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,199
Speaker 0: No one's doing that.

1185
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:02,661
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1186
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:04,339
Speaker 1: But like red wall, there's not very mousy.

1187
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:07,715
Speaker 0: No, but you get, you know, Bugs Bunny.

1188
01:06:07,775 --> 01:06:08,318
Speaker 0: You don't see it.

1189
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,885
Speaker 0: It's not clever.

1190
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:14,160
Speaker 0: Imagine if Daffy Duck was had Bugs Bunny's personality as well as getting away with shit.

1191
01:06:14,482 --> 01:06:15,953
Speaker 0: And Bugs was the one who was getting shot.

1192
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:16,900
Speaker 0: It wouldn't make any sense.

1193
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,518
Speaker 0: It wouldn't make any sense for a duck to be so smart and always tricking the hunter.

1194
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,609
Speaker 1: I mean, ducks never win Stanley Cobb.

1195
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:27,100
Speaker 0: So of course, I'm just saying it wouldn't make sense.

1196
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:27,381
Speaker 0: Right.

1197
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:30,295
Speaker 0: So this is the same reason that rabbits are chosen here to be smart.

1198
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:35,580
Speaker 1: But the book seems deserving of the fact that it's so well known.

1199
01:06:36,306 --> 01:06:37,139
Speaker 0: It is well known.

1200
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:38,298
Speaker 1: I really liked it.

1201
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:44,516
Speaker 0: If you like rabbits or adventures, you should read it because it won't take you that long.

1202
01:06:44,556 --> 01:06:45,418
Speaker 0: if you actually try.

1203
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,899
Speaker 1: It'll either take you three days or eight months.

1204
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:49,483
Speaker 1: Yep.

1205
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:50,319
Speaker 0: Something like that.

1206
01:06:50,942 --> 01:06:54,240
Speaker 0: The next book will probably take you eight months, even if you read it every day.

1207
01:06:54,861 --> 01:06:56,931
Speaker 1: You know what, Scott?

1208
01:06:57,453 --> 01:06:59,000
Speaker 1: I wouldn't pick The Count of Monte Cristo.

1209
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,318
Speaker 1: I will tell you now.

1210
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,100
Speaker 0: You're going to go even harder.

1211
01:07:02,361 --> 01:07:10,180
Speaker 1: No, there is a fantasy book that I don't know by two mediocre fantasy authors together.

1212
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,560
Speaker 1: They're both famous in their own right.

1213
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,279
Speaker 0: Why would you pick something mediocre?

1214
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,479
Speaker 1: The book is almost three inches thick.

1215
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:17,994
Speaker 0: OK.

1216
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:21,660
Speaker 1: I read the first two thirds of it.

1217
01:07:21,825 --> 01:07:22,015
Speaker 1: Why?

1218
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:25,839
Speaker 1: Because I used when I was younger, I just had this idea of if I get better.

1219
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,200
Speaker 0: I'm thinking at least there's some legit reason.

1220
01:07:28,681 --> 01:07:35,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, this book, these are famous authors and people like them, but the same kinds of people.

1221
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,909
Speaker 0: Is it your friend R.A.

1222
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:38,180
Speaker 0: Salvatore and someone else?

1223
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:38,858
Speaker 1: No, God, no.

1224
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:52,200
Speaker 1: That was the first book ever that I had started reading, made it more than a third of the way through, and still decided to quit at some point before the end.

1225
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,757
Speaker 1: I never read the last like 200 pages.

1226
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,377
Speaker 0: So you want to pick it so that I'll have to read the whole thing and you'll only have to read 200 pages?

1227
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:04,200
Speaker 1: That depends entirely on how much I enjoy or do not enjoy.

1228
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:05,719
Speaker 0: I can't have no control over that.

1229
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:08,058
Speaker 0: I don't even have control over whether I'm going to enjoy it.

1230
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:13,860
Speaker 0: It just has a significant place in nerd culture and I therefore I think it is worth investigating.

1231
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:20,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you could say the same thing based on current nerd culture about Ready Player One.

1232
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,439
Speaker 0: There's literally no reason to give that book a second look.

1233
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:25,140
Speaker 0: But this has passed a greater test of time than those have.

1234
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,048
Speaker 1: It's largely forgotten.

1235
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:30,300
Speaker 0: I think only like- So is Game of Thrones if there wasn't suddenly a TV show.

1236
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,519
Speaker 0: Well, actually- It's in the same place Game of Thrones was in.

1237
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:46,380
Speaker 1: I've read a lot of increasing articles and sentiment that the Game of Thrones TV is actually taking the questionable parts of Game of Thrones and making them not just questionable but just bad and misogynistic and fucked up.

1238
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:48,899
Speaker 0: Well, it's bad and fucked up to begin with.

1239
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,314
Speaker 1: So there's a bunch of bad things happen to characters.

1240
01:08:52,340 --> 01:09:01,819
Speaker 0: If Game of Thrones had never had a TV show made of it, I still would- And I went to that bookstore and I had the same thoughts about picking a long fantasy series.

1241
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:05,959
Speaker 0: I still would not have picked Game of Thrones because of its reputation and what I knew about it.

1242
01:09:06,524 --> 01:09:10,600
Speaker 0: All I knew about it- But I have seen these books on the shelves of trusted nerds.

1243
01:09:11,201 --> 01:09:12,875
Speaker 1: I always thought Game of Thrones was lost.

1244
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,359
Speaker 1: It's going nowhere and the end won't be satisfying.

1245
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:20,200
Speaker 1: Of course, The Prince of Nothing might not be going anywhere.

1246
01:09:20,586 --> 01:09:21,038
Speaker 0: That's true.

1247
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,538
Speaker 1: If those books don't go anywhere, I don't know what I'll do.

1248
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,640
Speaker 0: But The Wheel of Time, the author is dead.

1249
01:09:26,966 --> 01:09:28,819
Speaker 1: The author is dead in all works of literature.

1250
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,679
Speaker 0: No, literally though.

1251
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,140
Speaker 0: So there's someone else who took over but I don't think you have to read those ones.

1252
01:09:35,482 --> 01:09:37,819
Speaker 1: I'm worried that this is gonna be a slog.

1253
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:39,560
Speaker 0: It is quite possible.

1254
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:40,960
Speaker 1: It's got my knees gonna break.

1255
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,055
Speaker 0: I'm not denying it.

1256
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:44,560
Speaker 0: You don't see me saying it's not gonna be.

1257
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:48,359
Speaker 0: I'm saying I chose it despite the same worries that you have.

1258
01:09:48,461 --> 01:09:49,800
Speaker 1: I'm never making it to the coffers.

1259
01:09:50,022 --> 01:09:52,580
Speaker 0: Every apprehension you have, I also have.

1260
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:54,560
Speaker 0: But I venture forth regardless.

1261
01:10:00,491 --> 01:10:02,630
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1262
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:07,730
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
