1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,653
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday May 17th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:15,700
Speaker 0: We talk about the worst anime ever.

3
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:23,052
Speaker 1: Let's do this Despite purchasing the new Mario game for the DS.

4
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:24,459
Speaker 1: We were very productive today.

5
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:32,971
Speaker 0: that's because we purchased many other things and We ate and we did all kinds of stuff before we played it.

6
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:41,184
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were very non geek kind of normal person I mean we put a new clothesline out in the back which took quite a bit of doing Yeah, but you know what?

7
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:42,650
Speaker 0: as soon as they're done recording this shit.

8
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:49,420
Speaker 0: It's gonna be Mario Mario Mario Mario Yeah, some Mario multiplayer, and you won't get to find out about it until next Tuesday.

9
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:52,010
Speaker 1: All I'll say is I like the game a lot.

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,474
Speaker 1: I've already beaten world world one And those mega mushrooms are fantastic.

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,025
Speaker 0: Oh God yeah, like.

12
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:03,900
Speaker 0: I thought they were just gonna like be bleh, but the way they're the way they work is really cool.

13
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:06,499
Speaker 1: Plus this is one thing and I got to say something about this now.

14
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:11,599
Speaker 1: The music is always like dupe dupe dupe dupe and some people like a little choir goes like ha ha.

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:21,469
Speaker 1: Whenever the music goes ha all the goombas do a little jump in unison if they're on the screen and all the turtles go do Like a little dance like ha ha and it's just.

16
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:22,111
Speaker 1: it's hilarious.

17
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:23,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

18
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:24,280
Speaker 0: there's really good stuff going on.

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,128
Speaker 1: There's lots of little stuff like that.

20
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,920
Speaker 1: Nintendo's really got it going with the little and we've only played level one.

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,886
Speaker 0: So wait till next Tuesday.

22
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:36,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in the actual news Normally, I wouldn't really talk about something like this or I'd wait until a Monday, but this is just too ludicrous.

23
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:40,480
Speaker 1: The RIAA has sued XM radio.

24
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:44,420
Speaker 0: Did XM radio download some mp3s with Kazaa?

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:56,638
Speaker 1: Well their basic argument is that the XM radio technology can store songs on it You know time shifting and such or even just storing it temporarily while it buffers or plays to you.

26
00:01:57,442 --> 00:02:00,840
Speaker 1: Therefore it has quote-unquote iPod like capabilities.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:09,898
Speaker 1: Therefore they claim that it's all sorts of violations and vague laws and stupid crap and they want to renegotiate the royalties and charge more.

28
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:14,600
Speaker 0: But there's an iPod.

29
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:16,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they don't like that either.

30
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,797
Speaker 1: remember when they sued the the first because you don't like it.

31
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:21,565
Speaker 1: tough shit No, but it's there.

32
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:22,771
Speaker 1: remember that's the way America works.

33
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,640
Speaker 1: You can sue anyone for anything at any time.

34
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,840
Speaker 1: There's nothing to stop you from suing people.

35
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:32,174
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure XM won't take this lying down because they're all who they haven't.

36
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:34,020
Speaker 0: they're already kind of losing to serious.

37
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:36,819
Speaker 0: So they're not gonna take a lawsuit that'll put them away for good.

38
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:41,340
Speaker 1: XM said they're going to fight this to the end to the bitter horrid end.

39
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,432
Speaker 1: They're putting their entire team behind and they will not back down.

40
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,299
Speaker 0: All I can think about is how.

41
00:02:47,162 --> 00:03:08,464
Speaker 0: You know people were talking a few weeks ago about how the if you took all the technology companies versus all the music companies and record companies in the US Like just Microsoft or just Google could buy and sell them all the record companies together like over and over again Multiple times.

42
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:19,469
Speaker 0: it's insane that these record companies which are so measly and worthless are pushing around these giant powerful technology companies because they dump all this money to lobbyists.

43
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:25,019
Speaker 1: and All the technology companies are busy making more technology and they don't really worry about it so much.

44
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:31,199
Speaker 0: And they're not really good at lobbyists because you don't need to lobby to do perfectly normal and legitimate goods.

45
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:37,799
Speaker 0: Yeah for now You only need to lobby when you're doing bad shit and you need to make sure the government doesn't stop you from doing bad shit.

46
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,515
Speaker 0: If you're doing perfectly normal stuff, like let's say I'm a manufacturer of goods.

47
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:48,419
Speaker 0: I buy raw materials I process them into you know, worked goods and I sell them.

48
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:51,540
Speaker 0: I don't need to lobby because I'm not doing anything wrong.

49
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:55,112
Speaker 1: You need to lobby if you have other people lobbying against you.

50
00:03:55,513 --> 00:03:58,880
Speaker 0: if my business model depends on a law Existing then I need to lobby.

51
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:06,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what if the some lobbyists against may see you make milk and some anti milk lobbyists are making your milk industry collapse?

52
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:10,851
Speaker 0: Yeah The exact opposite is.

53
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:16,380
Speaker 0: no one's trying to get rid of milk But there's a billion people trying to make milk plus plus more than its worth.

54
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:20,427
Speaker 1: I'm more worried about this bacon trend that we've been noticing though It might just be that we don't eat it.

55
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:34,720
Speaker 1: like most stuff on the walls normal restaurants Every single item on the menu at TGI Friday's had bacon and cheese Literally, we're not kidding other than like the appetizers which most of them actually had bacon anyway, and the vegetarian menu.

56
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,485
Speaker 1: Everything had bacon.

57
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,760
Speaker 1: every single burger listed on the menu had bacon and cheese on it.

58
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,512
Speaker 0: It went to quiz knows bacon and cheese, even though it tastes good.

59
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,159
Speaker 0: I had it but bacon and cheese.

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,748
Speaker 1: We're thinking that it has to do with the fact that pigs are fed mostly on corn Which is made very easily and cheaply in the United States.

61
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,800
Speaker 0: ergo bacon and of course cheese.

62
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, cheese.

63
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:59,159
Speaker 1: It'd be fine if it wasn't that processed yellow crap cheese.

64
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:12,600
Speaker 0: I think bacon cheese and corn are the three foods that like if you look ask any American Or you just look inside the stomach of an average American 90% of what's in there is gonna be bacon cheese and corn.

65
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:13,323
Speaker 1: I don't know.

66
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:17,580
Speaker 1: I think our friend Dave tips the scale entirely toward bologna and my Wonder bread.

67
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:21,365
Speaker 0: Well Wonder breads corn Not so much.

68
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:22,631
Speaker 0: Yeah, really go look.

69
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:23,154
Speaker 0: It's scary.

70
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:24,340
Speaker 0: There's a lot of corn syrup in there.

71
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,319
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there's corn syrup and a lot of things but it's mostly wheat.

72
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,567
Speaker 1: Yeah There's not so much call.

73
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:32,149
Speaker 0: It's really.

74
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,580
Speaker 0: it's less we eat or else it would be wheat bread.

75
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,633
Speaker 0: It's more really bleached as crap bear, you know, but that's still wheat.

76
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,936
Speaker 0: You're not whole wheat.

77
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:44,265
Speaker 1: It's still a wheat though It's just bleached refined wheat.

78
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:45,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is mostly flour.

79
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:46,932
Speaker 0: It's almost flour.

80
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:47,995
Speaker 1: flour is just wheat.

81
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:52,012
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all wheat Still unless you make oat bread.

82
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,299
Speaker 1: It's all wheat.

83
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,767
Speaker 0: Then why did they have wheat bread and white bread?

84
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:57,630
Speaker 1: because wheat bread.

85
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,219
Speaker 1: they call it that it's just less processed and there's more wheat.

86
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:07,209
Speaker 1: Okay, whole wheat not a sweet Alright, so you got a news cuz there's nothing.

87
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:17,002
Speaker 1: Alright, there's nothing I can say about my news other than that The RIAA is horrible corrupt bastardly evil Manipulative.

88
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:18,326
Speaker 1: I could go on for a while.

89
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:19,068
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna stop there.

90
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:19,650
Speaker 0: Yep.

91
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:21,797
Speaker 0: My news is anime related.

92
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:31,300
Speaker 0: fear that This fall We're gonna be downloading because it surely won't be available in English on DVD at that time.

93
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:36,924
Speaker 0: It'll just be coming on to Japanese TV An anime Hopefully fansubbed.

94
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:38,672
Speaker 0: Well, I can guarantee it'll be fansubbed.

95
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:40,380
Speaker 1: We'd better get a hold of this anime.

96
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,940
Speaker 1: If I don't watch it, I might get all upside down II inside adding maybe some twisty turning.

97
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,932
Speaker 0: Okay, um that note that note death note.

98
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:51,558
Speaker 0: It could be some death note anime.

99
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,000
Speaker 1: I don't know.

100
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,413
Speaker 1: I'm still really really excited about the death note live-action.

101
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:59,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I wasn't so excited I was like, yeah, I'll see it someday like the initial D live-action.

102
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,563
Speaker 0: I'll see it something.

103
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,629
Speaker 1: but we saw the trailer.

104
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,469
Speaker 0: but then I saw the trailer which was Exactly like the manga only live-action.

105
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,866
Speaker 1: like you're watching the trailer and the whole time you'll think like, ooh I hope they do this.

106
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:11,712
Speaker 1: then they show you the scene.

107
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,598
Speaker 1: You're like, oh they did it.

108
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:14,696
Speaker 1: Oh, I wonder if they're gonna you and then you see it.

109
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,299
Speaker 1: I wonder if he looks like oh everyone looks exactly the way they should.

110
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:23,056
Speaker 1: Everyone looks like they're acting really well and then at the end you think wait a minute.

111
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,908
Speaker 1: There's one character I didn't say there is.

112
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:27,383
Speaker 0: yeah It's amazing.

113
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:28,728
Speaker 0: go if you don't if you know about.

114
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:31,056
Speaker 0: if you don't know about that note read the manga.

115
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:32,019
Speaker 0: the manga is the best.

116
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:35,649
Speaker 0: Death note is probably after you read the manga.

117
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,555
Speaker 0: There are five volumes out in English right now.

118
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:38,759
Speaker 0: The sixth one is coming soon.

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,540
Speaker 0: go and watch the trailer for the movie and Then wait for this anime and keep buying the manga as it comes out in English.

120
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:48,991
Speaker 1: I don't think it's gonna be a initial D movie.

121
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,780
Speaker 1: In fact, I think it's going to be the exact opposite.

122
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:52,672
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm still skeptical.

123
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:53,560
Speaker 0: the anime will be good.

124
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,514
Speaker 0: I mean sure I'll download it and watch it all and maybe even buy all the DVDs.

125
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:59,320
Speaker 0: just cuz I'm a huge Death Note fan.

126
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:04,193
Speaker 0: But Death Note is a lot of it isn't moving in action.

127
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:05,516
Speaker 0: It's internal monologue.

128
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:06,960
Speaker 1: It's it's light thinking.

129
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:09,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it won't gain a lot by being animated.

130
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,740
Speaker 0: You'll have if you if you do a not a very good translation from the manga.

131
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:27,140
Speaker 0: You'll you either have to really speed things up and skip over a bunch of parts People are just standing there talking or a lot of minutes internal monologue, which is usually painful and terrible.

132
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least in an anime.

133
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:36,351
Speaker 0: so I really want to see how they do it without either a ruining my death note is about or be Being really boring anime.

134
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:44,400
Speaker 0: now the movie I think has a much more Potential because in the movie you just take the key events and string them together and you skip all the boring stuff in.

135
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,300
Speaker 1: Well, not only that but I like to look at it.

136
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:56,138
Speaker 1: The initial D movie got all the wrong things right like they focused on like oh We're gonna have this thing from the show and this thing from the show and this thing from the show and they had him Exactly from the show.

137
00:08:56,641 --> 00:09:04,078
Speaker 0: The problem is that didn't add anything to the movie and the movie itself was crap as a result because the movie didn't have the good Things from the show it only took the bad things in the show.

138
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:11,696
Speaker 1: now I have a feeling that the Death Note movie is gonna have the right things wrong Meaning they'll know which things need to be altered for the screen and that sort of thing.

139
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:14,179
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm But then they'll do them wrong.

140
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:17,220
Speaker 0: Not you said right things wrong.

141
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:22,751
Speaker 1: Yeah Because before I said wrong things right Initial D had the wrong things right as opposed to the right things wrong.

142
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:24,958
Speaker 1: You change the things to be wrong according.

143
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:25,520
Speaker 0: Okay?

144
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,026
Speaker 0: Okay, you just didn't get it.

145
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,030
Speaker 0: It's not I can do.

146
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,059
Speaker 1: I was being clever with words and you just missed it.

147
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:31,526
Speaker 0: No, no, you weren't so clever.

148
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:32,430
Speaker 0: You were just obtuse.

149
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:34,740
Speaker 1: the right things wrong as opposed to the wrong things, right?

150
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:35,930
Speaker 1: I think that's pretty clear.

151
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,679
Speaker 0: I think you're just wrong.

152
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,373
Speaker 0: Okay, okay Death Note anime baby.

153
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:49,538
Speaker 1: All right I'm the juggernaut bitch.

154
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:54,713
Speaker 1: I'm the juggernaut bitch Fucking Charles get out of my head.

155
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:55,519
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

156
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:57,831
Speaker 1: LSD fuck.

157
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:58,277
Speaker 1: is this shit?

158
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,681
Speaker 1: All right.

159
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:05,308
Speaker 1: This is something that I saw a long time ago, and I thought it was stupid Like it was a good years on Google video.

160
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:20,456
Speaker 1: And actually I think I saw it on a website somewhere and It was just this video of some guy dubbing over some voices in the x-men The original good Fox x-men cartoon, which is the only x-men that Scott likes pretty much.

161
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:24,334
Speaker 1: I watched about 30 seconds of it and thought wow, this is just stupid.

162
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,319
Speaker 1: didn't bother with it.

163
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:30,540
Speaker 1: So today we were looking at funny cat videos on Google's top video top 100.

164
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're ever bored just go on Google video and search for funny cat videos.

165
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:34,640
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

166
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, search like cat or puppy.

167
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:40,260
Speaker 1: My favorite video along those lines is the cat versus a million puppies.

168
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:48,394
Speaker 1: It's just this cat sitting there like man And like 11 puppies standing around the cat like ooh, look at that.

169
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:49,157
Speaker 1: Ooh, what's this?

170
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:49,458
Speaker 1: What's this?

171
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:49,719
Speaker 1: What's this?

172
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:53,803
Speaker 1: Let's play Let's play and the cats like what the fuck Go away.

173
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:56,011
Speaker 0: the Fox on the trampoline is also quite good.

174
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:58,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Fox on the trampoline that things been getting everywhere.

175
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,126
Speaker 1: I bet it'll hit Google's top hundred soon.

176
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:03,719
Speaker 1: Probably it's just this Fox who finds the trampoline and goes nuts on it.

177
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:12,521
Speaker 1: But anyway, I saw this thing on Google's video top 100 and I thought what the hell how can that be on top 100?

178
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:13,358
Speaker 1: This thing is just ass.

179
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:16,879
Speaker 1: So then I watched it all of it all nine minutes of it.

180
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:19,934
Speaker 1: It's any individual moment of it.

181
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:20,619
Speaker 1: Isn't that funny?

182
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,200
Speaker 1: But in aggregate it just becomes more and more stupid and hilarious.

183
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:29,908
Speaker 0: Get you my pimp cane My pick-pimp cane.

184
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:30,572
Speaker 1: look at all this money.

185
00:11:30,612 --> 00:11:31,517
Speaker 1: I got bitch.

186
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:36,785
Speaker 1: I'm the juggernaut The juggernaut bitch I'm not sure.

187
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:37,448
Speaker 1: just watch it.

188
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,654
Speaker 1: I'm not sure why it's funny.

189
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:44,839
Speaker 1: The voice acting is It's not really well synced, but they really got into it the guys that were doing it and it.

190
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:53,860
Speaker 0: It's got this like low level of humor throughout Yeah, and you don't even really have to know anything about the x-men or who these characters are to think it's funny.

191
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:57,873
Speaker 0: But if you do know who they are, it'll be like it'll add a tiny bit.

192
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:01,376
Speaker 1: It's real close to lowbrow really close.

193
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:06,980
Speaker 0: Alright, my thing today is also a Google video that I found at work while I was bored.

194
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,599
Speaker 1: This one's just kind of like creepy.

195
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:12,793
Speaker 0: I Figured it's martial arts kind of.

196
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:13,900
Speaker 0: so I guess it.

197
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:19,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there's a martial art called to hurt yourself severely with no gain exactly my point.

198
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:25,460
Speaker 0: So it fits in on anime day, I guess this is what from Malaysia, right?

199
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,700
Speaker 0: So this is a video of some Malaysian people doing quote unquote extreme martial arts training.

200
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:34,258
Speaker 1: I'm just picturing it again.

201
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,840
Speaker 0: So the video starts with this guy who climbs up this tower.

202
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:43,356
Speaker 0: It's like must be more than 50 feet tall like maybe 75 feet tall.

203
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,328
Speaker 1: No, no, no It looks like it's about 30 or 40 feet tall.

204
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:46,971
Speaker 0: It's pretty tall.

205
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,080
Speaker 1: Anyway, I know what a 70 foot tall tower.

206
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,379
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's tall enough where if I jumped off of it, I would die.

207
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:57,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, I imagine a pile of rim laying at the bottom of this thing.

208
00:12:57,842 --> 00:13:02,760
Speaker 0: So this guy jumps off and turns into a pile of him laying at the bottom of this thing.

209
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:03,988
Speaker 1: But then they get him up.

210
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:04,511
Speaker 1: they steady him.

211
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:05,840
Speaker 1: His legs are obviously broken.

212
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:12,180
Speaker 0: He's like his entire body turns purple and bruised and it's horrible and his legs have to be broken.

213
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,760
Speaker 0: There's no way they can't be it's just obvious.

214
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:22,928
Speaker 1: So he's standing there and he's breathing and he does himself off and they help him over and he climbs the thing again And does it again.

215
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:24,699
Speaker 1: this time he lands on his face.

216
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, this guy does this like three or four times.

217
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:32,760
Speaker 0: It's quite like at first you're like, whoa, but then later you're like, oh god.

218
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:43,400
Speaker 1: now there's obviously a little bit of trickery going on in that it's pretty obvious that the ground is Saturated with water and a little soft, but he obviously has a technique for landing.

219
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,516
Speaker 0: But at the same time even so he is he is a wounded man.

220
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,700
Speaker 0: He is severely wounded.

221
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:50,628
Speaker 0: Now the second part of the video.

222
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,334
Speaker 0: they show people jumping through glass.

223
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:53,760
Speaker 0: now, this isn't really much of a trick.

224
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:56,712
Speaker 0: They use really thin glass that breaks easily.

225
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,400
Speaker 1: It's not a sugar glass so it can't hurt you.

226
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:03,660
Speaker 0: They run then they jump and they put their hand their arms over their head.

227
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:06,891
Speaker 0: They jump headfirst through the glass, of course their arm.

228
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:07,754
Speaker 0: They're really going arm.

229
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:14,079
Speaker 0: first the glass breaks They roll the rest of their body through the glass while minimally touching it.

230
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:19,480
Speaker 0: Then they roll on the ground and they turn around and strike some cool martial arts pose.

231
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:21,129
Speaker 1: That part's not so exciting.

232
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:24,990
Speaker 0: then at the end of the video They combine the two.

233
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:36,360
Speaker 0: a guy runs jumps through glass and Then basically out of a building and then he lands on the ground outside the building and he's not dead But I think he's close at this point.

234
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that guy is when he jumps out of that building just right face on the ground not move.

235
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,931
Speaker 0: Yeah, this guy doesn't land on his legs with any trickery.

236
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:48,660
Speaker 0: This guy lands like wump Big gash on his leg.

237
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, the glass fell out of the window apparently and he must have landed on the glass and he fucked himself up.

238
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:57,834
Speaker 0: So watch this video and go.

239
00:14:57,854 --> 00:15:11,291
Speaker 0: wow If you think you know crazy Christians and people who believe in Randy bullshit in this country I like how you started with crazy Christians, of course These people are infinitely more stupid now.

240
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:17,799
Speaker 1: my best guess as to what's going on here This is rims best guest TM as opposed to my actual best guess.

241
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:29,129
Speaker 1: I Imagine some people who went to Malaysia thinking I'm going to become the Malaysian martial arts master and I will find these people to train me like, you know the people who go to try to become kung-fu monks.

242
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,170
Speaker 1: and Then a bunch of guys find him.

243
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:40,594
Speaker 1: They're like, yes, we will train you Jump out of that building Repeatedly, it will make you strong and then he comes back a week later.

244
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:42,020
Speaker 1: He's like I've been jumping out of that building.

245
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:44,623
Speaker 1: I feel stronger and they're like Crap.

246
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:45,306
Speaker 1: he's still alive.

247
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:45,928
Speaker 1: What do we do now?

248
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:49,260
Speaker 1: Tell him to jump through a plate glass window out of a building.

249
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,716
Speaker 1: All right that finished him off.

250
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:54,844
Speaker 1: You know what.

251
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:57,676
Speaker 0: that's probably not true, but it makes a better story than the truth.

252
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:07,360
Speaker 1: so well We'll pretend for now All right, so it's worst week and we're gonna talk about the worst anime ever.

253
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:13,280
Speaker 0: Now there's some bad anime out there and there's some anime we hate like.

254
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,081
Speaker 0: I don't know.

255
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:15,285
Speaker 0: What's a bad anime?

256
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:17,875
Speaker 1: That's not the worst of air gear tactical roar.

257
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:22,611
Speaker 0: Yeah air gear tactical roar Those are bad shows, but they're not the worst shows ever.

258
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:23,735
Speaker 0: and Naruto.

259
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:24,960
Speaker 0: We don't really like so much.

260
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:27,900
Speaker 0: Well, we like the first few episodes, but then it's down hill.

261
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,651
Speaker 1: Yeah, or like Yu Yu Hakusho was one episode of cute two episodes of cute.

262
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:34,520
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah - two episodes followed by crap.

263
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:41,940
Speaker 0: Yep, so in Dragon Ball Z We really don't like and it's just crap fighting but it's not the worst ever.

264
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:44,619
Speaker 1: We're talking about the worst of the worst.

265
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:48,803
Speaker 0: So terrible, you can't watch it Like like.

266
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:50,828
Speaker 0: there's some things that are so bad.

267
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,152
Speaker 0: you MST 3k them.

268
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:54,198
Speaker 0: These are the things that are so bad.

269
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:57,105
Speaker 0: you just Burn them in a fire now.

270
00:16:57,145 --> 00:17:00,234
Speaker 1: We're leaving out a lot of things that we haven't actually seen.

271
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:02,660
Speaker 1: for yeah, I do megalopolis.

272
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:04,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, do megalopolis is?

273
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:09,260
Speaker 0: it looks like it's really bad and I've heard it's really bad from a lot of people.

274
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:10,548
Speaker 0: And what's that about milk?

275
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:12,358
Speaker 1: something super milk Sean?

276
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,540
Speaker 1: Well, actually that comes out of the fact that right before the show I did some research on the Internet.

277
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:25,429
Speaker 1: I went to a whole bunch of forums looking for threads about worst anime and going through them to see What the Internet as a whole seemed to think the worst anime are.

278
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,275
Speaker 1: I'll note that one.

279
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:31,419
Speaker 1: they systematically listed every anime ever.

280
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't really help.

281
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:37,060
Speaker 1: and a lot of people listed things that weren't anime.

282
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:41,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was also bad like totally spies or x-men.

283
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:43,580
Speaker 0: yeah x-men is not an anime.

284
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,173
Speaker 0: There is no x-men anime.

285
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:50,120
Speaker 1: shut up But I mean there were people who were like yeah eska flow day is like the worst thing I've ever seen.

286
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,926
Speaker 1: It's just slow and crappy and the music's terrible.

287
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:52,548
Speaker 1: Did they walk?

288
00:17:52,688 --> 00:18:02,320
Speaker 0: Oh, and we're also gonna leave out things like the Fox eska flown a and What is it warriors of the wind the worst right thing to ever happen to anime?

289
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:14,920
Speaker 0: So if someone took a good anime or at least an anime that wasn't the worst anime and they remixed it or edited it or Modified it in some way to make it the worst anime that doesn't count.

290
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:23,335
Speaker 0: For example one piece on American television is crap compared to the real one piece anime in Japan but that doesn't count.

291
00:18:23,356 --> 00:18:30,266
Speaker 1: and Also while we're gonna leave a lot out after we name a few infamous shows We're gonna kind of try to do a generic.

292
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,720
Speaker 1: here are the calling signs of the bad bad bad bad bad anime.

293
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:41,977
Speaker 0: All right, let's save the worst for last and start with the big one.

294
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:43,649
Speaker 1: Which one?

295
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:49,240
Speaker 1: I think you were leaving a real bag hoping yeah Let's start with Legend of Lemnier Lemnier.

296
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:52,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, um we didn't make a list.

297
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,580
Speaker 1: I can explain the plot, but it doesn't matter.

298
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,620
Speaker 1: There's something about the silver something.

299
00:18:58,142 --> 00:18:58,926
Speaker 1: There's a guy.

300
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:05,272
Speaker 0: I don't remember the plot cuz I saw it once and I burned my eyes out So I'd never see it again, and then I forgot a girl.

301
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:06,939
Speaker 1: There's swords and magic.

302
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:09,828
Speaker 1: Everyone gets randomly naked.

303
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:20,540
Speaker 0: yeah boobies boobies boobies boobies, but it's not pent I it's just you know how in fantasy stuff that or sci-fi stuff You'll often have the girls shirt gets torn off just randomly.

304
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:27,140
Speaker 1: This happens a lot in Lemnier like what the plot is just like stupid deus ex machina crap.

305
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:28,708
Speaker 1: There's really nothing to it.

306
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,056
Speaker 0: animation is bad.

307
00:19:30,176 --> 00:19:32,685
Speaker 0: Everyone's ugly Thank God.

308
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:33,429
Speaker 0: This is only like.

309
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,219
Speaker 0: was it a movie or an OVA?

310
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:38,480
Speaker 1: I don't know how long it was, but it felt like it was four hours.

311
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,436
Speaker 0: I think it was just one movie, and I fell asleep during it.

312
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:45,267
Speaker 0: probably and You just don't want to watch this ever.

313
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:46,351
Speaker 0: if you see it's notice.

314
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:48,057
Speaker 0: It's only on VHS not on DVD.

315
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:48,740
Speaker 0: as far as I know.

316
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:54,935
Speaker 0: You never want to see Legend of Lemniar LEM NEAR Lemnier.

317
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:56,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we're not.

318
00:19:57,303 --> 00:20:00,214
Speaker 1: Some people have said in the forums when we talk about an anime.

319
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:01,238
Speaker 1: That's not good like.

320
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,746
Speaker 1: yeah I watched it cuz.

321
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,196
Speaker 1: it sounded like it was so bad.

322
00:20:04,256 --> 00:20:04,699
Speaker 1: It's funny.

323
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:08,951
Speaker 1: We're telling you right now no show we mentioned is worth watching.

324
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:15,213
Speaker 1: like not even for the humor value because there isn't any Watch at your own peril.

325
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:22,518
Speaker 1: We're not kidding Because Lemnier is definitely not the worst of the bunch of the worst.

326
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:26,592
Speaker 0: no But it is bad enough to be labeled one of the worst anime ever.

327
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:28,820
Speaker 1: now far closer perhaps the bottom.

328
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,880
Speaker 1: Perhaps this is tied with the worst anime down there at the very bottom, but gray the digital target.

329
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:36,289
Speaker 0: Oh my god great digital tag.

330
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,113
Speaker 1: now if you google.

331
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:38,900
Speaker 0: I think great deals target is the worst.

332
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:39,702
Speaker 1: I don't know.

333
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:41,769
Speaker 1: you haven't actually seen the other one.

334
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:42,632
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about.

335
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:43,114
Speaker 1: well.

336
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:51,172
Speaker 0: I have still My god Let's talk about great digital target all right now if you google for it.

337
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:53,720
Speaker 1: great the digital target sounds kind of interesting.

338
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:54,703
Speaker 0: Everyone is.

339
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:58,797
Speaker 0: it's a sci-fi anime movie based on some manga that I never read.

340
00:20:58,997 --> 00:20:59,599
Speaker 1: everyone who?

341
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:09,320
Speaker 1: Reviews it talks about the dystopian future and the the intricate Sociopolitical ramifications of what's going on and these long-glowing reviews, and that is what it's about.

342
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:10,628
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

343
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,078
Speaker 1: it's about a guy.

344
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:20,572
Speaker 1: well No, it's a girl who randomly has boobs popping out yeah, and a bunch of fighting Yeah, and then the movie just stops because they ran out of money.

345
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,017
Speaker 0: There's the robot with one arm.

346
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,463
Speaker 1: all right There's a scene.

347
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:25,312
Speaker 1: I mean the animation is so bad.

348
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:27,120
Speaker 1: There is this robot guy.

349
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:30,154
Speaker 0: What animation is just a bunch of still shots one after the other.

350
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:31,159
Speaker 1: who gets so?

351
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,863
Speaker 1: Wounded that eventually.

352
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:35,814
Speaker 1: he's a torso with a head and one arm.

353
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:36,557
Speaker 0: He's a robot.

354
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:46,360
Speaker 0: now He's heading one arm right head and one arm one Head a torso a single arm no legs no second arm.

355
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:49,253
Speaker 0: So you have a torso and a head with a single limb.

356
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:51,484
Speaker 1: now point the first one Appended.

357
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:57,987
Speaker 1: there is a scene where he climbs a mountain And they show him climbing and he reaches up with the arm And he pulls himself up.

358
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:04,294
Speaker 1: then he lets it go with the arm Reaches up with the arm and pulls himself up further that this does he holding on with the teeth.

359
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:08,368
Speaker 1: what he's talking in fact While he's climbing that's right now.

360
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:11,679
Speaker 1: This wouldn't be so bad in and of itself.

361
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:14,855
Speaker 1: Maybe they liked if they didn't actually show him climbing with.

362
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:15,960
Speaker 1: it's the broken animation.

363
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:20,173
Speaker 1: But to his climbing this mountain is critical.

364
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:21,958
Speaker 1: critical to the plot.

365
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,924
Speaker 0: yeah It is now.

366
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:29,180
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say that you have to be perfectly realistic in an anime or a movie or anything.

367
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:32,620
Speaker 1: I mean dragons don't seem to really exist.

368
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:37,000
Speaker 1: So we can't have a movie about dragons without making up some dragon stuff.

369
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:41,440
Speaker 1: It's okay to futz with physics a little bit, but good God.

370
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't mind it when Lupin's car drives on the wall.

371
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:57,249
Speaker 0: But if you're gonna have a one armed one headed one torsoed robot Climbing a mountain you got another thing coming now Especially if you're not being all slapstick in whatnot?

372
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:58,212
Speaker 0: you're being dead serious.

373
00:22:58,232 --> 00:22:59,255
Speaker 1: This movie is serious.

374
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:00,960
Speaker 1: They are not joking around.

375
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:01,886
Speaker 0: No, they're not.

376
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:04,080
Speaker 1: now you think all right that doesn't sound so bad.

377
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,815
Speaker 1: It's kind of long and we're watching and we're not gonna stop watching.

378
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,728
Speaker 1: because once we start watching a show We're not gonna stop until we see the end of it.

379
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:16,618
Speaker 1: unless I fall asleep which often happens Like with that last Lupin movie we watch yeah, I gotta go finish that up.

380
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:24,553
Speaker 1: But the movie it's moving toward conclusion, and I remember sitting there This is back in college thinking all right this fuckers gonna end.

381
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:29,119
Speaker 1: I'm gonna find out what happened I'll have closure, and then I'll never speak of it again.

382
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:30,917
Speaker 1: The movie doesn't end.

383
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:33,712
Speaker 0: Okay, so just you know the way.

384
00:23:33,772 --> 00:23:34,676
Speaker 0: the plot is.

385
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:41,500
Speaker 0: this is evil Supercomputer and they want to destroy it because it runs the world and enforces the dystopian society.

386
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:43,912
Speaker 0: So they want to destroy this evil computer.

387
00:23:44,515 --> 00:23:56,376
Speaker 0: so at the end of the movie They go towards the evil computer to destroy it like they're finally gonna go do it like they're walking over with the guns toward the Horizon like we're gonna go and the movie and you think that you're gonna see.

388
00:23:56,557 --> 00:23:57,320
Speaker 0: after you're ready.

389
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:08,347
Speaker 0: You're gonna see a big fight scene where they run into the giant computer place And they fight robots and they destroy the evil computer and maybe someone dies along the way And then the movie's over.

390
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:10,820
Speaker 1: suddenly the animation stops.

391
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:16,177
Speaker 0: If you don't get to see the action scene on their way over to the tower the animation stops.

392
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:16,920
Speaker 1: it stops.

393
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:20,345
Speaker 1: It shows the horizon and like their shadows in the distance And then those disappear.

394
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:35,800
Speaker 1: then text appears over the screen And it says something like five hours later the supercomputer system stopped functioning and then The the image in the background gets kind of wavy like there's an explosion and then the credits roll.

395
00:24:36,462 --> 00:24:42,379
Speaker 0: I think they actually changed the frame to a second picture, which has an explosion on it and play an explosion noise.

396
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:47,350
Speaker 1: I Remember screaming horseshit at the TV and then going to bed.

397
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:49,897
Speaker 0: I remember everyone was like fuck this shit.

398
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:50,840
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

399
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:55,616
Speaker 1: Wow we should have done the juggernaut bitch because now we're just all foul-mouthed today, that's fine.

400
00:24:55,917 --> 00:25:02,810
Speaker 0: the juggernaut bitch Motherfucking gray digital target no motherfucking ending.

401
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:05,380
Speaker 1: what the hell not a goddamn thing you can do about it.

402
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,244
Speaker 0: I got damn thing.

403
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:09,220
Speaker 1: now Scott hasn't seen the other anime.

404
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,279
Speaker 1: That's really down there with gray the digital target, but he's heard about it.

405
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:16,976
Speaker 0: I heard about it on anime world order where they did a whole episode about it.

406
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:17,739
Speaker 1: I've seen it.

407
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,427
Speaker 1: I saw the sci-fi channel.

408
00:25:20,547 --> 00:25:22,593
Speaker 1: do it dubbed on TV?

409
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:25,320
Speaker 1: once it is called Odin?

410
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:35,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't really want to call it Odin because that is disgraceful to Odin the god of various things Vikings with an eyepatch.

411
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:42,668
Speaker 1: So yeah the reason you call it Odin Is because anime world order did that and you listen?

412
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:42,888
Speaker 1: well

413
00:25:42,928 --> 00:26:01,732
Speaker 0: no no because in the movie Odin one of the voice actors for one girl at one point you know the girl screams Odin in in the movie and the voice actor did it like oh Now then they played that audio clip in the show and I thought it was hilarious.

414
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,055
Speaker 1: this movie is ass.

415
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:05,984
Speaker 1: it is ass ass ass Ass ass ass ass.

416
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:06,968
Speaker 1: don't watch it.

417
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,755
Speaker 1: So it's not good.

418
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:15,600
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to Summarize what I heard on an anime world order and what I remember from listening to it weeks ago.

419
00:26:16,063 --> 00:26:18,420
Speaker 0: But you should go and listen to their episode on Odin.

420
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:23,920
Speaker 0: Yes, and if you want to know the whole story about this horrible horrible anime because they know every much everything about it.

421
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,931
Speaker 0: It's called it's really called Odin something.

422
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:31,160
Speaker 0: space sailors starlight something.

423
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:36,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got ships that go through space with sails that light something something.

424
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:36,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, who cares?

425
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:40,393
Speaker 0: It was it's a very expensive movie.

426
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:41,780
Speaker 0: They spent a lot of money on it.

427
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,803
Speaker 0: They thought it was going to be the next big thing Whatever.

428
00:26:45,164 --> 00:26:48,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, whoever thought that should dine afire, but all the voice acting suck the anime.

429
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:50,040
Speaker 0: everything sucked about it.

430
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,937
Speaker 0: It was just so so terrible, but then they tried to sell it big time because they spent so much money on it.

431
00:26:55,957 --> 00:27:10,618
Speaker 1: And Yeah, yeah like Gundam f91 was really bad and suffered from the same problems of let's just dump a lot of money into an anime and it'll be Really popular and awesome, but nothing really came quite close to the absolute horror.

432
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:15,109
Speaker 1: That is Odin Mm-hmm it I can't God.

433
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:26,140
Speaker 0: Yeah now notables that really aren't on the list But we like to hold out that there's one that should be on the list But we haven't seen so we can't talk about it for more than a few seconds.

434
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,366
Speaker 0: That's Final Fantasy Legend of the Crystal.

435
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:33,380
Speaker 1: whatever everyone I've ever heard who's all who've seen this show said it was terrible.

436
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:40,139
Speaker 0: now I the anime club at RIT has the VHS tape and I remember I Saw it once and I was like, huh?

437
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,872
Speaker 0: Maybe I should watch that and every single person who had ever seen it or knew anything about it said Do not watch that.

438
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:50,203
Speaker 0: it is so bad It's not you know, it's.

439
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:56,160
Speaker 0: it's the worst thing ever and I've never heard a single positive statement about this show from anyone.

440
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,642
Speaker 1: You know what?

441
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:57,869
Speaker 1: I think you're really gonna like it.

442
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,391
Speaker 1: Yeah.

443
00:27:58,793 --> 00:27:59,356
Speaker 0: Yeah.

444
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:04,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, go ahead Go find an old VHS tape of Final Fantasy Legend of the Crystal, whatever it's called.

445
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:05,236
Speaker 0: Yeah.

446
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:06,560
Speaker 0: Yeah watch that.

447
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,652
Speaker 1: I dare you the quote from the anime or Expo forums where I was.

448
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,638
Speaker 1: I was going through forums and someone mentioned this.

449
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,755
Speaker 1: they said It is physically painful to watch.

450
00:28:15,997 --> 00:28:16,540
Speaker 1: I was nauseous.

451
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:20,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's a terrible fucking anime.

452
00:28:22,061 --> 00:28:24,488
Speaker 1: Granted Final Fantasy unlimited wasn't much better.

453
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:28,480
Speaker 0: No if I was in limited was also bad, but it wasn't terrible.

454
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,486
Speaker 1: Yeah, it at least had one redeeming feature.

455
00:28:30,547 --> 00:28:32,653
Speaker 1: Tell that chocobo who would bite the girl's head.

456
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:33,416
Speaker 0: That's right.

457
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:35,764
Speaker 1: Oh, oh I like.

458
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:39,420
Speaker 0: I really like choke and the animation was newer and shinier and not painful.

459
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,102
Speaker 1: Yeah, why couldn't?

460
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:43,794
Speaker 1: they had just made it like Final Fantasy the chocobo and the cute girl.

461
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:45,720
Speaker 0: Yeah chocobo the anime.

462
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:46,805
Speaker 1: That'd be freaking great.

463
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:49,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, they should also have Dragon Warrior the slime the anime.

464
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:52,548
Speaker 0: Oh, no, the slide already has its own game.

465
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:54,474
Speaker 1: the slime and the chocobo should team up.

466
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:56,200
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the other one company.

467
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,165
Speaker 0: They can fucking do that.

468
00:28:57,326 --> 00:28:57,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they should.

469
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,175
Speaker 0: I know I'm Chris a lot.

470
00:28:59,195 --> 00:28:59,778
Speaker 0: this episode.

471
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:03,370
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, geek nights is not rated G.

472
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:04,535
Speaker 0: no, no, it's not.

473
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:08,796
Speaker 0: it's rated like are But on some days and pg-13 on other days.

474
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:10,742
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

475
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:15,616
Speaker 1: All right now some no other notables that really don't deserve to be on the list even though they're pretty bad.

476
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:28,308
Speaker 0: the lens man Lensman I think is like it's real close to being on the list and I you know I haven't seen it but from what I've heard from people It's just about as bad as the Final Fantasy.

477
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:29,351
Speaker 0: so which kind of should be?

478
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:30,474
Speaker 0: it's just that it.

479
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:32,943
Speaker 1: it's really maligned it Go.

480
00:29:33,024 --> 00:29:36,400
Speaker 1: it's based on what is supposedly a very good body of science fiction.

481
00:29:36,629 --> 00:29:42,100
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah The books supposedly are like the greatest side or well not the greatest but very good science fiction novels.

482
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,184
Speaker 1: the movie is one of these.

483
00:29:43,224 --> 00:29:55,595
Speaker 1: like it tries to do too much with it and it it goes in all these different directions and It's long and plotting and the end is like typical Mid 80s anime end if that doesn't mean anything to you.

484
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:56,317
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

485
00:29:56,437 --> 00:30:09,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's Imagine and it just has like a j-poppy early j-rock kind of like music over while the hero like escapes from the exploding thing at the end and this takes several minutes after the Big villain.

486
00:30:10,003 --> 00:30:13,400
Speaker 1: whatever explains whatever existential bullshit the movie was trying to be about.

487
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:18,940
Speaker 0: The only reason the lens man isn't way down in the worst anime ever is that there are actually some people who like it.

488
00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:21,252
Speaker 0: No one likes the other anime we talked about.

489
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:22,117
Speaker 0: I know one.

490
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:24,467
Speaker 1: I Like the lens man.

491
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:27,840
Speaker 1: All right in the same way that I like the game gear.

492
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:43,780
Speaker 1: I grew up with it because you know I first saw anime in fourth grade when the sci-fi channel showed a whole bunch of anime on a Saturday and I watched it all and For about a year after that I watched any anime I could get my hands on and loved it.

493
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:56,760
Speaker 1: Among that I got a tape of lens man, which was fantastic and I watched it a bunch of times Now that I'm older and wiser and even then there were twinges of like wow, this is really boring.

494
00:30:57,423 --> 00:31:00,998
Speaker 1: Wow, they don't explain anything about that thing that they just used to finish the plot with.

495
00:31:01,018 --> 00:31:05,602
Speaker 0: Wow hmm Let's see.

496
00:31:05,703 --> 00:31:09,179
Speaker 0: Oh, I want to give a special note about robot carnival.

497
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:16,360
Speaker 0: Aha Robot carnival is a collection of short animated features by different people.

498
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:19,675
Speaker 0: I think there's a katsuhiro tomo thing in there.

499
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:26,640
Speaker 0: I don't really remember But you know, there's one that's kind of frankenstein II and there's one that's got these people in a balloon.

500
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:31,660
Speaker 1: This was also shown on that early early, you know when I was in fourth grade sci-fi channel thing, right?

501
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:39,471
Speaker 0: Now the thing about it is some of it has some artistic redeeming value Which is why it's not the absolute worst.

502
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:46,199
Speaker 0: It's not like, you know, the same tier as lens men But most of it is just incredibly painful and useless and terrible.

503
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:51,360
Speaker 1: Also, I just I thought of this out of the blue kashan robot hunter.

504
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:54,809
Speaker 0: Well, no concern is terrible.

505
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:57,136
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the anime which is worse.

506
00:31:57,297 --> 00:31:58,220
Speaker 0: Is it really that bad?

507
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:11,880
Speaker 1: Oh when I when I found out that that movie that we thought was gonna be awesome from the trailer the live-action was Based on this thing I about cried because I saw this on the sci-fi channel back when I wanted any anime in the world.

508
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:14,079
Speaker 1: I loved anime and I thought it was stupid.

509
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,441
Speaker 0: Wow.

510
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:19,144
Speaker 1: Yeah, it it's it It's stupid.

511
00:32:19,345 --> 00:32:20,230
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into it.

512
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:21,979
Speaker 1: Let's not talk about it.

513
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,067
Speaker 0: That's a bad anime right there.

514
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:32,154
Speaker 0: Notice how a lot of the bad animes are old like Any anime that's recent at least has decent enough art.

515
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:34,260
Speaker 0: art to be not terrible.

516
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:39,695
Speaker 0: I mean in order to be a really bad anime you have to have no story.

517
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:40,698
Speaker 0: No art.

518
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:42,123
Speaker 0: No music No, nothing.

519
00:32:42,204 --> 00:32:48,653
Speaker 0: if there's some anime out there that just have good music and the rest is terrible Those at least are not the worst because they have something good about them.

520
00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:48,854
Speaker 1: Yep.

521
00:32:48,874 --> 00:32:49,557
Speaker 1: They got the music.

522
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:51,183
Speaker 1: They got the chocobo They got something.

523
00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:51,744
Speaker 0: Yep.

524
00:32:52,246 --> 00:33:02,618
Speaker 0: New animes seem to always have at least some redeeming value Of some such like tactical roar I guess had some mech stuff in it, I guess.

525
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,057
Speaker 1: yeah I guess air gear was kind of hilarious because it was so stupid.

526
00:33:07,258 --> 00:33:14,958
Speaker 0: Yep See, but there are absolutely no redeeming qualities to these old old terrible shows because they're just old and terrible.

527
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:23,571
Speaker 1: now I'd like to have a bunch of nods to ass things that more modern or Otherwise good anime have done to put them real close to being on this list.

528
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:24,875
Speaker 1: My biggest one.

529
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:26,320
Speaker 1: My biggest gripe is noir.

530
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:38,986
Speaker 1: Now when we first heard about noir and people have been talking like there's a lot of buzz about it for some reason and it came out and we watched the first episode and only the first episode at anime club and It was awesome.

531
00:33:39,288 --> 00:33:41,160
Speaker 1: Anyone who's seen the first episode of noir?

532
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:50,760
Speaker 1: It's like this crazy like really neat music Really like cool action scenes and the hint of what could be an awesome plot.

533
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:58,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you keep watching a few more episodes It's still kind of awesome and the show goes steadily downhill.

534
00:33:58,195 --> 00:33:59,780
Speaker 1: like it gets more and more outrageous.

535
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,150
Speaker 1: I mean it goes from like there's the scene.

536
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:11,927
Speaker 1: everyone who's seen the first episode will remember the one scene Where the girl hangs the guy by the necktie and it's just done really artistically and awesomely by halfway through the show.

537
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:22,120
Speaker 1: fight scenes basically involve a little girl standing there with two pistols and Standing across from her are like a thousand guys with guns and she kills them all without moving.

538
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:27,339
Speaker 1: Yep, and the end of noir is perhaps the stupidest ending.

539
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,280
Speaker 1: Versus it's not the worst thing in any ending attending anime ever.

540
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:41,553
Speaker 1: But compared to how good the first episode of noir was it is probably the greatest disparity in an anime ever Especially since it it was completely separate from what the show was.

541
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:47,119
Speaker 0: I mean they had this dark cool Urban noir action and they should have just stuck with that.

542
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,835
Speaker 0: But then a little ways into the show they brought in that Chloe Character and it got all weird and they got all weird and mystical.

543
00:34:53,955 --> 00:35:01,918
Speaker 0: and then at the end of the show They really brought that stuff in and it was like it's like the ending of the show Was nuns with guns.

544
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:11,720
Speaker 1: Literally these nuns come out with these golden pistols and the nuns are like it's time to do what we've always been trained to do And they go out with the guns and they all fight and then nuns with guns.

545
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:19,779
Speaker 0: It seems like they made two shows one was about nuns and a scary cult and whatever and one was noir.

546
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,461
Speaker 0: and They ended up just taking the ending of one show and sticking it at the end of noir and they threw the ending of noir Away

547
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:43,696
Speaker 1: plus the end doesn't make sense because the end involves this high priestess woman standing there and she's like you must kill me to become noir and seal your fate as the assassin blah blah blah blah blah and They end up killing her anyway, even though they avoid killing her in this specific situation.

548
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:47,400
Speaker 1: they kill her a little bit later Yeah, and then they just like literally the end of the movie.

549
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:47,983
Speaker 1: Just they.

550
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:48,426
Speaker 1: the show is.

551
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:54,076
Speaker 1: they walk away and the police arrived and they're all like We're gonna arrest you and they're like whatever and they walk away and that's the end.

552
00:35:54,096 --> 00:35:56,488
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm It's just it's dumb and there's a lot of a pit.

553
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,732
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the love bits cool lava pit nuns with guns lives.

554
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:09,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, another thing that a lot of shows do that makes them suck is Fighting god.

555
00:36:09,148 --> 00:36:10,676
Speaker 0: now a fight in a show is cool.

556
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,952
Speaker 1: Everyone loves a good action scene in fact if a fights important enough.

557
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:17,040
Speaker 1: I wouldn't mind if it spanned a couple episodes.

558
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:30,122
Speaker 0: Yeah, but when you watch a show like rave master was a cute Happy show I was watching just because it was a cute happy show and then I realized that there was a fight that had lasted ten episodes or such Naruto.

559
00:36:30,183 --> 00:36:32,189
Speaker 0: the first few episodes are happy ninja school.

560
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,624
Speaker 0: and then there's a fight that lasts ten episodes or such Dragon Ball.

561
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:39,493
Speaker 0: every fight it lasts ten episodes or such.

562
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:41,760
Speaker 1: well Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball was actually kind of funny.

563
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:50,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, Dragon Ball is it when I'm talking about Dragon Ball Z and GT and GT is even worse, you know, it's okay If you have a plot, that's good.

564
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:52,196
Speaker 0: If there's a fight that's important to the plot.

565
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:52,919
Speaker 0: That's good.

566
00:36:54,262 --> 00:37:05,039
Speaker 0: If you drag out if the whole substance of your show is just making more episodes By having people come up with techniques and talk about how their technique will counter that technique and love it

567
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:13,815
Speaker 1: If you do that with real-world things like at least initial D though I'm not saying initial D is highbrow anime at least when they come up with the.

568
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:15,200
Speaker 1: oh, well, he blah blah blah blah blah.

569
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:20,558
Speaker 1: It's based on a real thing and the races only last two episodes in.

570
00:37:20,598 --> 00:37:21,180
Speaker 1: like Naruto.

571
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:24,089
Speaker 1: They whenever they just make shit up like you can just like.

572
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,948
Speaker 1: oh, well, I use the special flying puppy magic dagger Puppy puppy.

573
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:30,540
Speaker 0: that's not substance.

574
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:35,160
Speaker 0: It's just a waste of my time to watch that shit and the shows that so much potential.

575
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,928
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of shows fall into this.

576
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,620
Speaker 1: Yu Yu Hakusho was cute and funny and then it turned into crap.

577
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:44,782
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I watched the first two episodes Yu Yu Hakusho and I was like, oh, that's why people say this show was good No one.

578
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:47,573
Speaker 0: and then I found out the rest of the show is fighting bleach.

579
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:48,557
Speaker 1: Awesome.

580
00:37:48,677 --> 00:37:49,621
Speaker 1: Awesome characters Like.

581
00:37:49,762 --> 00:37:52,420
Speaker 1: I really really love the characters and I think the plot is cool.

582
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:53,676
Speaker 0: I don't like the characters that much.

583
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:58,132
Speaker 0: the plots Okay, but at the same time what really ruins the show is the fighting.

584
00:37:58,253 --> 00:38:00,058
Speaker 1: it's just they've everyone's fighting and that's all.

585
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,329
Speaker 0: the show is Just shown in action.

586
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:04,260
Speaker 0: like but it's not just shown in action.

587
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,150
Speaker 0: Does there shows that are not in the shown in action genre that just have?

588
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,773
Speaker 0: Useless substance list shallow fight equivalents.

589
00:38:13,355 --> 00:38:23,167
Speaker 1: Yep, or instead of a fight There's the monster a day or item of the day episodic format like Inuyasha Where oh we have to find the thingy.

590
00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:24,090
Speaker 1: Oh, there's the thingy.

591
00:38:24,612 --> 00:38:27,400
Speaker 1: Oh the thingy split into 10 billion pieces.

592
00:38:27,561 --> 00:38:29,855
Speaker 1: We must spend one episode each collecting them all.

593
00:38:30,298 --> 00:38:33,090
Speaker 1: great Cuz I actually like the story of Inuyasha.

594
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,114
Speaker 1: I think it's a good story.

595
00:38:34,134 --> 00:38:35,178
Speaker 1: I like the characters.

596
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,463
Speaker 0: man I like it so much.

597
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:43,459
Speaker 1: the problem is for every one minute of character development and plot I get 29 minutes of bullshit.

598
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:52,526
Speaker 0: yep, another thing a lot of animes do that's bad is Take two different genres and stick them together.

599
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:55,874
Speaker 0: a good example of this is Full metal panic.

600
00:38:55,894 --> 00:39:06,227
Speaker 0: full metal panic could have been a really good show because the robot half of it with the Story about the war and whatnot was actually kind of good and I watched the whole first season just for that

601
00:39:06,628 --> 00:39:11,667
Speaker 1: and by the same Token, the other half the funny school military hijinks half was

602
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:12,310
Speaker 0: pretty funny.

603
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:17,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, the you know, there are a lot of school hijinks shows and they're good and bad.

604
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,970
Speaker 0: But this one was you know, slightly above average sticking them together Subtracted from both of them.

605
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,319
Speaker 0: I Think that that's really the point of full metal panic.

606
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,600
Speaker 0: So it's kind of silly to say to take it out, but full metal panic would have been better is two separate shows.

607
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:40,360
Speaker 1: I think it suffers from the fact that the military part was too serious and cool and the other part was just too silly.

608
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,605
Speaker 1: So there's too much disparity.

609
00:39:41,886 --> 00:39:45,220
Speaker 1: You can't jump back and forth between emotions that quickly or it ruins the effect.

610
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:54,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think plus earlier in the show There's a lot more school and later in the show those a lot more military which kind of helped it a little bit Which is how I was able to finish the show.

611
00:39:55,341 --> 00:40:06,340
Speaker 0: but yeah the school should have been a little less happy and the military should have been a little less serious because The military plot really wasn't deep enough to hold up to its seriousness.

612
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:15,159
Speaker 1: Now here's a specific gripe about a specific show and series and franchise that frankly they should have let it die a long time ago.

613
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:20,778
Speaker 1: Tenshi Muyo it the original Tenshi Muyo the TV and the OAV.

614
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:25,240
Speaker 0: in the first movie I really like I kind of sort of invented the harem show.

615
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:31,432
Speaker 0: Yeah, but harem shows are bad But at the same time at least inventing any genre.

616
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:32,195
Speaker 1: and it did it.

617
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:33,860
Speaker 1: Well, the show is funny and heartwarming.

618
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:34,809
Speaker 1: I like the characters.

619
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,900
Speaker 1: I really enjoy Tenshi.

620
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:37,827
Speaker 1: Now for some reason.

621
00:40:37,847 --> 00:40:38,612
Speaker 1: well not for some reason.

622
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:39,980
Speaker 1: it's obvious why they did it money.

623
00:40:40,826 --> 00:40:45,510
Speaker 1: But they made another movie and Alright, this movie is kind of a but it's not so bad.

624
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,413
Speaker 1: It's short whatever.

625
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:51,219
Speaker 1: and they made another movie Which was basically just doujinshi fan service porn.

626
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:57,300
Speaker 1: Then they made Tenshi GXP, which is one of the worst travesties to everyone about Tokyo one.

627
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,734
Speaker 1: And then and before the OAVs there were the first two.

628
00:41:00,754 --> 00:41:05,475
Speaker 1: the first OAV is awesome Except at the end when they pull this thing where they come out.

629
00:41:05,515 --> 00:41:06,360
Speaker 1: They're like the last episode.

630
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,660
Speaker 1: They're like, here's a million million million million plot things that will never resolve, huh?

631
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:16,600
Speaker 1: And then they decided to make another OAV and try to explain all that crap and that's not a good idea.

632
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:21,611
Speaker 1: Tenshi in Tokyo was self-indulgent indulgent crap.

633
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,440
Speaker 1: It just went nowhere and it was just a money grab.

634
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,146
Speaker 1: It was also kind of poorly animated.

635
00:41:26,668 --> 00:41:26,929
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

636
00:41:27,411 --> 00:41:29,538
Speaker 1: The third movie is like terrible terrible.

637
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:31,767
Speaker 1: terrible though It's worth watching because it has one funny thing.

638
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:33,052
Speaker 1: That's not intentionally funny.

639
00:41:33,072 --> 00:41:36,440
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm when the grandpa I'll ruin the movie.

640
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:42,379
Speaker 1: There's this tree and the grandpa's got to kill the tree because the tree is a thing An axe an axe that'll kill the tree.

641
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,596
Speaker 1: No, he goes and gets his lightsaber a lightsaber to kill a tree.

642
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:47,083
Speaker 0: when he's an axe Well, he has this.

643
00:41:47,364 --> 00:41:48,349
Speaker 1: don't get me started.

644
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,680
Speaker 1: So he walks over to the tree and the tree's name is Haruna.

645
00:41:51,082 --> 00:41:53,675
Speaker 0: All right, I'm done with this and he'd like he knew the trees.

646
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:54,680
Speaker 1: It's a long story.

647
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,064
Speaker 1: It's kind of.

648
00:41:55,104 --> 00:41:56,740
Speaker 1: it would have been really cool if they'd done it differently.

649
00:41:57,461 --> 00:42:02,640
Speaker 1: He takes his little sword and he screams her name like harder to and he starts stabs into the tree.

650
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,959
Speaker 1: All right, and then it cuts away and I'm like, oh we had to kill the tree.

651
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:07,366
Speaker 1: Oh how poignant.

652
00:42:08,189 --> 00:42:09,274
Speaker 1: and the show keeps going for a while.

653
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:10,679
Speaker 1: it cuts back to him.

654
00:42:11,122 --> 00:42:14,000
Speaker 1: He's still cutting through the tree and he's still screaming Haruna.

655
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:17,809
Speaker 1: It cuts back to other action minutes later.

656
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,953
Speaker 1: It cuts back to him again.

657
00:42:19,254 --> 00:42:21,340
Speaker 1: He's still cutting through the tree and he's still screaming Haruna.

658
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,149
Speaker 1: Alrighty then it's just silly.

659
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:26,939
Speaker 0: that sounds pretty silly to me.

660
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:35,611
Speaker 1: plus the movie plays out as though someone wrote a doujinshi where They wrote themselves into the tenchi universe in order to have sex with tenchi.

661
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,620
Speaker 1: Wow, the movie like the movie is painful to watch.

662
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:43,415
Speaker 0: Okay, let's talk about tenchi GXP, which I saw the first four episodes of.

663
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,200
Speaker 1: sadly first off This has nothing to do with tenchi.

664
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:51,499
Speaker 1: They put the name on it and they put the characters in the background to try to make it popular kind of like Gundam see destiny.

665
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:55,900
Speaker 0: Well, no Gundam see the gun as he does needs a different story actually.

666
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:05,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they start bringing the main characters back apparently more and more and having and then they become the main characters of the new Show, yeah GXP is like a show that has nothing to do with tenchi.

667
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,753
Speaker 1: But then see that thing that just went by in the back.

668
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,040
Speaker 0: What's the show that everyone knows?

669
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:11,760
Speaker 0: I guess Naruto or everyone knows Naruto.

670
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:21,080
Speaker 0: Imagine if I made Naruto XP and all the characters from the original Naruto were in it But they were never actually in the foreground.

671
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:27,040
Speaker 0: You might see them in the background like just let you know like hiding around like if you're playing an RPG.

672
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,117
Speaker 0: They would be the townsfolk that you can't actually talk to like.

673
00:43:31,137 --> 00:43:36,342
Speaker 1: you'll see Kakashi just like sitting in a chair as the characters walk by and they don't interact at all And then he's gone.

674
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:42,224
Speaker 0: and you'll see Naruto like jump from one roof to another but you'll never talk to him and he'll never do Anything in the story.

675
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:51,007
Speaker 0: and it's all about some other characters just who happen to be in the same world Where the characters that you used to know and love still exist But they have nothing to do with it.

676
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,292
Speaker 1: now that alone wouldn't be so bad.

677
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:54,120
Speaker 1: But the show itself is just ass.

678
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:59,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, tenchi GXP is ass ass ass ass and all the characters in the original tenchi are in the background.

679
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,240
Speaker 1: Now we didn't put this in the worst list.

680
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,866
Speaker 0: Oh tenchi muyo GXP.

681
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:11,252
Speaker 1: the reason it's not on the worst list is because the opening I was about to say Nobody's not on the worst list is that the opening song is cool.

682
00:44:11,392 --> 00:44:13,260
Speaker 0: The opening song is really cool and you have something.

683
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:16,440
Speaker 0: If you have an opening song that's cool.

684
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,007
Speaker 0: You're not the worst anime because they're anime.

685
00:44:19,027 --> 00:44:21,815
Speaker 0: they don't have cool opening songs and they're worser.

686
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:24,538
Speaker 0: Yeah worser worser That's what they are worser.

687
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:29,307
Speaker 1: Now harem shows are generally bad.

688
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:31,373
Speaker 1: I don't like love Hina.

689
00:44:31,654 --> 00:44:33,480
Speaker 1: it's too close to pedophilia for me.

690
00:44:33,761 --> 00:44:37,875
Speaker 0: I actually watched way back in the day the whole first season of love Hina.

691
00:44:38,337 --> 00:44:40,565
Speaker 0: Oh my god You know why I watched it.

692
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:41,287
Speaker 1: turtles.

693
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:43,596
Speaker 0: I was waiting for the goddamn turtles to show up.

694
00:44:43,757 --> 00:44:45,768
Speaker 1: the turtles are awesome But that's all that show has.

695
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:46,453
Speaker 0: all the show has.

696
00:44:46,514 --> 00:44:47,300
Speaker 0: it's why it's not worst.

697
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,038
Speaker 1: It has a turtle like tenchi was a harem show, but it was also clever and funny.

698
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:53,285
Speaker 1: Love Hina wasn't clever.

699
00:44:53,626 --> 00:45:01,546
Speaker 0: It was always the same thing and he accidentally being perverted getting hit Accidentally being perverted getting hit.

700
00:45:01,847 --> 00:45:02,148
Speaker 1: Yep.

701
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,431
Speaker 0: That's the whole show.

702
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:06,560
Speaker 1: get close to a different girl depending on which episode it is.

703
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,280
Speaker 1: There's a different kind of girl for every kind of scary fanboy.

704
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,099
Speaker 0: It's still the main girl that everyone loves and you get with her in the end.

705
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, how do people watch this crap?

706
00:45:16,437 --> 00:45:17,360
Speaker 0: because they're perverted.

707
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:22,084
Speaker 0: They're otaku who can't get any women.

708
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:24,609
Speaker 0: so they need to fantasize about some anime woman.

709
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:38,807
Speaker 0: and Since you can't have a different and it's cheaper to make one anime with a woman for every guy Than it is to make eight anime with one each one having the girl for each type of guy Now it is a equal opportunity.

710
00:45:38,847 --> 00:45:46,731
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not just for scary fanboys because there's the show out now mine liebe Which is just the same kind of harem show only for girls.

711
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:47,715
Speaker 1: It's all these pretty boys.

712
00:45:48,056 --> 00:45:48,417
Speaker 1: Yep.

713
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:49,581
Speaker 0: Yep Yep.

714
00:45:49,802 --> 00:45:56,845
Speaker 0: Now notice how we haven't mentioned any actual hentai or actual, you know rated X Yeah, we or Yuri.

715
00:45:56,865 --> 00:45:58,190
Speaker 1: We haven't seen any of that crap.

716
00:45:58,471 --> 00:45:59,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz we're not perverted.

717
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:01,865
Speaker 0: We don't watch Porn anime.

718
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:08,735
Speaker 0: I mean if I'm gonna look at porn I live real porn first of all and second of all I'm not gonna watch something that has the facade of a plot.

719
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,536
Speaker 1: I Saw part of the blue girl at a con.

720
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:22,100
Speaker 0: Yeah I think if you're if you're not perverted and you say the only hentai you've seen is the blue girl and you never watch anymore You okay, actually you can watch cutie, honey.

721
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:25,034
Speaker 0: Also, but any more than that and that's no good.

722
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:26,160
Speaker 1: now there are a lot.

723
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,705
Speaker 1: I mean, there are some shows that aren't.

724
00:46:28,428 --> 00:46:29,692
Speaker 1: I watched elven bride.

725
00:46:29,712 --> 00:46:31,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's actually kind of funny.

726
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,642
Speaker 0: That's a cut.

727
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,987
Speaker 0: it's an erotic comedy.

728
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:37,357
Speaker 0: Yes, like sanctuary the manga is an erotic thriller.

00:46:37,438 --> 00:46:38,160
Speaker 1: Yeah build as such.

730
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:44,460
Speaker 0: It's a political erotic thriller, but and it has some nakedness and some sex and stuff, but it's not a porno.

731
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,825
Speaker 0: It's mostly about the plot.

732
00:46:45,865 --> 00:46:47,310
Speaker 0: It's just the plot.

733
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,860
Speaker 0: has people having sex and when they do they show it.

734
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:52,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean how the bride is actually really kind of funny.

735
00:46:52,593 --> 00:46:55,768
Speaker 1: It's just a. it's a Sex comedy basically.

736
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, imagine like dancing penises.

737
00:46:57,878 --> 00:47:01,322
Speaker 1: and happy What Dancing penises?

738
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:01,543
Speaker 1: a?

739
00:47:01,924 --> 00:47:07,440
Speaker 1: no they are not in because well mostly because Japanese law and such they couldn't show genitalia.

740
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what an anime with dancing penises.

741
00:47:10,436 --> 00:47:15,440
Speaker 1: be high Larry's You know, we could go to the city and see puppetry of the penis.

742
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:17,128
Speaker 0: You don't want to actually see that.

743
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,394
Speaker 1: I saw a video of much of it.

744
00:47:18,716 --> 00:47:19,640
Speaker 0: That's all you need to say.

745
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,980
Speaker 0: It's actually really funny, but it is really funny, but it's you don't want to pay for it.

746
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:23,462
Speaker 0: No one see it.

747
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:26,860
Speaker 0: live that true unless you're you know into that sort of thing.

748
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:32,150
Speaker 1: But actually the other thing about hentai is it's fun to mock.

749
00:47:32,473 --> 00:47:34,129
Speaker 1: We've never actually been to it.

750
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:40,590
Speaker 1: But there's this like Dave and Buster's hint funny hentai dubbing the dick and Buster's David Buster's is an arcade slash restaurant.

751
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:45,870
Speaker 1: Yeah dick and we never actually end up going to it because it's always either full or we have better things to do at cons.

752
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,518
Speaker 1: But many people have told us it's hilarious.

753
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,045
Speaker 0: I don't doubt them that it's hilarious.

754
00:47:51,065 --> 00:48:09,390
Speaker 0: You know, it seems like I Can't really tell what's going on in the anime community with all this hentai stuff because I can't tell if there are a large number of perverts who I should shun and throw out the window or Are there a large number of people who just really enjoy?

755
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:17,070
Speaker 0: Using hentai as a tool for humor or is it a combination of the two and which side is more heavily favored?

756
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:18,254
Speaker 1: It's a combination.

757
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:19,238
Speaker 1: where mo?

758
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:24,509
Speaker 1: I think many of the people who are very open about liking hentai Very much like it for ironic or comedic value.

759
00:48:25,252 --> 00:48:30,372
Speaker 1: But I think there are a lot of people who like who say they like it for that but actually like it because it arouses them.

760
00:48:30,392 --> 00:48:32,333
Speaker 0: I Think so, too.

761
00:48:32,736 --> 00:48:41,166
Speaker 0: I think the majority say it's 75% You know arousal perverts and 25% Probably with the just humor.

762
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:51,650
Speaker 1: Yeah There's also the whole yaoi thing among young girls, which seems to be more of a cultural identity than an actual fetish or sexual proclivity.

763
00:48:52,492 --> 00:48:53,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't see.

764
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:59,530
Speaker 0: I mean at least I don't see You know girls actually getting off on yaoi.

765
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,202
Speaker 0: Well, like in a in a porn sort of way.

766
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,025
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

767
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:04,990
Speaker 1: Where would you see that?

768
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,362
Speaker 1: Where would you have the opportunity to see that?

769
00:49:07,382 --> 00:49:09,802
Speaker 0: I Don't know but I need to find out.

770
00:49:14,012 --> 00:49:16,580
Speaker 1: I Think we're about done here are we?

771
00:49:17,344 --> 00:49:17,766
Speaker 1: it's all right.

772
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:18,650
Speaker 1: We got to play Mario.

773
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:25,610
Speaker 1: I've the box I just the box is sitting right next to my microphone and I've been staring at it for the whole episode.

774
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:29,046
Speaker 1: Good job thinking about what I'm going to do in the game.

775
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:32,639
Speaker 0: No All right, let's see what else.

776
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,295
Speaker 0: is there anything else that makes an anime really terrible beside Bad?

777
00:49:36,335 --> 00:49:44,130
Speaker 0: voice acting always makes it terrible Yeah, but you usually get around that by watching the subs or the dubs, you know, vice-versa.

778
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,399
Speaker 0: Sometimes the Japanese voice acting is terrible.

779
00:49:46,620 --> 00:50:01,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I this is not a popular opinion But I contend that the American voice acting in the original dub of erasera to beautiful dreamer Which is one of my favorite movies ever is better than the original Japanese voice acting.

780
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:14,950
Speaker 1: Maybe that's just because you're used to the English But at the same time I've seen them both several times and I think they did a good job with the dub except for one Screwed up part, but that's like how Penn doesn't like Isaac Hayes words and shaft whatever.

781
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:21,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, you know animation glitches bad animation lack of animation.

782
00:50:22,254 --> 00:50:38,630
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not a stickler for art but if if you're as bad as say the original transformer series with its glitches of animation or If you're like utana where you have lots and lots of still frames and you just pan across them with the camera.

783
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:40,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least utana had an excuse.

784
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:48,596
Speaker 1: They had no money and a lot of plot and the fact that the show is good Despite the fact that they had no money to animate it says a lot It does like.

785
00:50:48,657 --> 00:50:51,093
Speaker 1: that show probably would have been much more Popular.

786
00:50:51,153 --> 00:50:54,730
Speaker 0: it would much worse if they had more money because it would more like the movie.

787
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:58,225
Speaker 1: No, not not because the movie was mostly kuhara's doing.

788
00:50:58,867 --> 00:50:59,470
Speaker 0: that's the point.

789
00:50:59,591 --> 00:50:59,872
Speaker 1: There was.

790
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:03,367
Speaker 0: no there wasn't so much Chiyo Saito saying hey, you can't do that to my character.

791
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:04,597
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's her name I remember.

792
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:05,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's awesome.

793
00:51:06,491 --> 00:51:06,852
Speaker 0: Yeah.

794
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:08,920
Speaker 0: Hey, let me make this great manga.

795
00:51:09,181 --> 00:51:11,269
Speaker 0: Hey, the scary guy is sitting outside my house.

796
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:13,274
Speaker 0: What does he want?

797
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:15,281
Speaker 0: He wants to make an anime of my manga?

798
00:51:15,562 --> 00:51:17,670
Speaker 0: No, he's a scary guy who sits outside my house.

799
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:20,063
Speaker 0: He's been there for a week fine.

800
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:24,345
Speaker 0: You can make the goddamn anime But I'm gonna make sure you don't make anything.

801
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:25,229
Speaker 0: perverted you sicko.

802
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:27,519
Speaker 1: I think the two of them really worked.

803
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:34,563
Speaker 1: Well because I the manga is mostly Chiyo Saito and The show is like a mix between the two and the movie is purely kuhara.

804
00:51:35,105 --> 00:51:39,259
Speaker 1: The movie is crazy Cornish crap because he kuhara is a scary dude.

805
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:45,779
Speaker 1: The manga is good and cute, but it's a normal Jojo, it lacks a certain something you need.

806
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:51,669
Speaker 1: like Ikuhara added the edge to the anime that made it Just one of my staples one of my favorite shows ever.

807
00:51:52,091 --> 00:51:58,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, the manga on its own might as well just be any other shoujo manga with somewhat magical girl whatnots.

808
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,024
Speaker 0: But the TV show is something else.

809
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:10,140
Speaker 1: once you add Ikuhara's whoa to it I guess it says you gotta have a little bit of that to make a show good a little bit of edge a little bit Of something a little bit of crazy guy.

810
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:15,161
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's what you need to be a good anime Not what you don't need to not be a bad one.

811
00:52:15,462 --> 00:52:17,710
Speaker 1: Don't do what Donnie don't does.

812
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:20,251
Speaker 0: That's Right.

813
00:52:20,612 --> 00:52:20,853
Speaker 1: All right.

814
00:52:20,873 --> 00:52:21,917
Speaker 1: I think we're actually done.

815
00:52:21,937 --> 00:52:23,201
Speaker 0: All right, cool.

816
00:52:23,603 --> 00:52:23,804
Speaker 1: Yep.

817
00:52:23,824 --> 00:52:24,205
Speaker 1: Tomorrow.

818
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:28,093
Speaker 1: We'll be talking about the worst people Throughout history.

819
00:52:28,474 --> 00:52:29,175
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

820
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:30,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not gonna.

821
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,313
Speaker 0: we're gonna avoid people who everyone knows about like Hitler and Stalin and stick to the People you don't know.

822
00:52:35,434 --> 00:52:39,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's not gonna be a comprehensive list because there are a lot of people out there who sucked.

823
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:42,120
Speaker 0: Oh god, there are so many bad dudes.

824
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:48,570
Speaker 1: It's mostly gonna be us talking about obscure guys You might not realize how bad they were and explaining why they're bad and why you should hate them.

825
00:52:48,851 --> 00:52:51,848
Speaker 1: One of them has a theme song that I'm going to play a little bit of.

826
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:59,790
Speaker 1: Now we decided against doing the worst people we currently know or we've known in our lives.

827
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:02,545
Speaker 0: That's more of a hate first of all, but we don't really hate.

828
00:53:02,686 --> 00:53:03,369
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know.

829
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,625
Speaker 1: No, no, cuz some of these people I would submit are objectively bad.

830
00:53:06,866 --> 00:53:09,658
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll note that We don't really know any of those people anymore.

831
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:10,321
Speaker 0: No, we don't.

832
00:53:10,663 --> 00:53:12,350
Speaker 1: we just hear stories about used to know them.

833
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:16,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course we wondered what do we do if those people listen to the show?

834
00:53:16,706 --> 00:53:19,263
Speaker 1: and then we remembered Oh, we won't care and we'll laugh.

835
00:53:19,585 --> 00:53:20,250
Speaker 0: That's right.

836
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:24,550
Speaker 0: I laugh at you and your miserable existence.

837
00:53:26,191 --> 00:53:28,278
Speaker 1: Your music's bad and you should fail bad.

838
00:53:28,298 --> 00:53:28,518
Speaker 0: Yep.

839
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:38,570
Speaker 0: So if anyone noticed, you know in worst week we did with the worst Hardware gadgets the worst game consoles and the video game consoles and the worst anime.

840
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:55,870
Speaker 0: That means at some point in the future we can have worst weeks two and possibly even three where we do stuff like worst Softwares or yeah worst Worst comics worst comics worst manga or video game worst board games.

841
00:53:56,151 --> 00:53:57,615

Speaker 0: Yeah, there are other ones.

843
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,286

844
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, Monopoly.

845
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:12,870
