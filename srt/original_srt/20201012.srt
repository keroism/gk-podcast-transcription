1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,587
Speaker 1: It's Monday, October 12th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:11,028
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,994
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:16,320
Speaker 1: We are talking about bricking things.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,818
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:26,780
Speaker 1: So, uh, we went upstate this weekend to do a long hike in the middle of nowhere.

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:28,449
Speaker 1: Like that's something I feel like I can get away.

8
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,460
Speaker 0: It seems like I say that seems like a safe place.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, middle of nowhere.

10
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,294
Speaker 0: There's no people you can't get sick right.

11
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:43,690
Speaker 1: coronavirus doesn't grow on trees Yep, and and even then if it did somehow I'm not out there like licking trees Like I'm just walking through the woods long distance, but you know, the trees are Having sex with your face though.

12
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:46,143
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but that's a problem I actually ran into.

13
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:51,640
Speaker 1: my allergies have been weirdly worse this fall than they've ever been and I don't know why.

14
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:57,700
Speaker 1: Like I've never had fall allergies before but I have them pretty bad this summer for some reason anyway.

15
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,200
Speaker 1: So we're up by ourselves on a very long difficult trail.

16
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:08,940
Speaker 1: like we figured the more difficult the trail is the fewer people we'd encounter which was correct and We're like 15 miles into this hike.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,440
Speaker 1: We're on our way back on this long trail from nowhere and we see two people coming up ahead.

18
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:22,164
Speaker 1: So we pull our masks up and then pull their masks up but then they like try to flag us down to like stop us and we're like, oh and Then I realize the trouble.

19
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:24,311
Speaker 1: one of them is holding a phone.

20
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:29,444
Speaker 1: I can clearly see that they have Google Maps up and Google.

21
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:30,915
Speaker 0: no, there is somewhere with service.

22
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:36,249
Speaker 0: That's good, but Have Trails in it like not usually.

23
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:43,319
Speaker 0: no unless you ask for like biking directions and the trail is bikable It won't give you walking trail direction like it might be like.

24
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,226
Speaker 0: hey There's a trail here like some trail.

25
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:49,543
Speaker 1: some very very popular big trails do show up if you zoom far enough in on Google But most don't.

26
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:51,170
Speaker 0: so also some people.

27
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,479
Speaker 0: you can if you take photos and submit them They'll show up on the on the map.

28
00:01:55,661 --> 00:02:01,749
Speaker 0: It's like you can click and see the photos people have taken from particular spots But it doesn't give you like a map you have to.

29
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:05,344
Speaker 1: so basically they ask us like hey Did you take the loop?

30
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:06,769
Speaker 1: and we're like loop?

31
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,013
Speaker 1: There's no loop trail.

32
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,558
Speaker 1: We just hiked like 15 miles.

33
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,681
Speaker 1: we've been hiking literally for like seven hours and They're like.

34
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:20,513
Speaker 1: and then like the one girl like looks really surprised and like her handshakes a little and the older woman is like I told you.

35
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,960
Speaker 1: So we start talking to them and eventually like she holds your phone out and she shows it to us and They're trying to get back to their car.

36
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:35,147
Speaker 1: They've been hiking for hours, and they thought they were doing a trail loop And they're like if we follow the blue trail.

37
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:39,447
Speaker 1: It's a loop right and we're like no Who told you that?

38
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:40,474
Speaker 1: do you have a trail map?

39
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,280
Speaker 1: They didn't have a trail map.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,060
Speaker 1: They had nothing and I see their Google.

41
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:45,407
Speaker 1: They have a pin where their car is.

42
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:53,935
Speaker 1: it is far away from where we are and Google is just a green square like there's Nothing that zoomed in and they're not even looking at the topographical map.

43
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:55,200
Speaker 1: They're looking at like the driving map.

44
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,512
Speaker 1: They clearly have no business being out in the woods.

45
00:02:57,573 --> 00:02:58,879
Speaker 1: nevertheless not a trail like this.

46
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:07,579
Speaker 1: So The more questions they ask the more concern we are that how many how many miles are they from their car?

47
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,131
Speaker 0: this they can Just walk back right you know because they had been hiking so one.

48
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:18,856
Speaker 1: it is like 40 minutes to sundown - we are easily hiking like three or four times faster than them.

49
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:19,940
Speaker 1: They are not fast hikers.

50
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:34,219
Speaker 1: They said they've been hiking for several hours, but the direction they came from Does not have several hours verse worth of hiking Unless where they came from is not where they think they're headed or they did something really fucked up.

51
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:37,232
Speaker 0: We could just tutor only two directions to go.

52
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:37,293
Speaker 1: no.

53
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:37,795
Speaker 1: No.

54
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:38,940
Speaker 1: This is a complex trail system.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,034
Speaker 1: There are lots of branching paths in this trail system, but how many parking lots could there be?

56
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:44,920
Speaker 1: there aren't really parking lots.

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:55,432
Speaker 1: There's trailheads and okay where they described they had come from there is no possible way that where we were headed Which was the only trailhead in that direction was where they could have come from.

58
00:03:55,974 --> 00:04:00,392
Speaker 1: so wherever their car was There is no way they could get back to that car before dark.

59
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:05,549
Speaker 0: and well all they had to do is Get to the modern escape right to a road.

60
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:06,131
Speaker 1: call an uber.

61
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:08,840
Speaker 0: Yes exactly that's them.

62
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:16,547
Speaker 0: They kept trying to ask for like help and at this point as much as uber is the worst thing ever and I've never used Them and hopefully never will.

63
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:31,120
Speaker 0: if you it they do have the advantage over Taxis or old-school car services in the you know because in the old days Before the uber types if you tried to call a car service on the phone That would be like hey send a limo to take me to the airport.

64
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:36,497
Speaker 0: You couldn't get someone to show up in the in a specific random spot to get you like immediately.

65
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:41,866
Speaker 0: that wouldn't happen Right, but now it's like yeah Actually that is I think the one thing.

66
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:51,026
Speaker 0: the one actually new service that those piece of shit gig economy Taxis provide is yes Those are in some any.

67
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:59,520
Speaker 0: no matter if you're on a road somewhere if it's a road that a car can go on You could push buttons on your phone if you have phone service and a car will come quick enough.

68
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,243
Speaker 1: Well, they give it this way.

69
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:04,680
Speaker 1: those services are fine except for the fact that they're exploitative gig economy if they cost.

70
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,048
Speaker 0: I mean, that's also.

71
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,497
Speaker 0: that's also true, right?

72
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:17,152
Speaker 1: So basically, I We give them our trail map because even though we I was using it to navigate like the rest of the way back to our Car I figured you're gonna get back.

73
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:22,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're capable hikers We we know how to do this, but I think you're gonna make it back where you came from.

74
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:31,080
Speaker 1: but when we handed to them it was clear that they didn't understand it and couldn't really read it and At that point we just bailed because we wanted to get to our car before dark.

75
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,347
Speaker 1: So we wish them luck and I basically told them look follow this trail You're on until you see a green trail.

76
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:45,640
Speaker 1: turn right and follow that because I knew that if they did that It would be really hard for them to miss that green trail and it will take them to a road.

77
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:52,400
Speaker 1: There is no parking on that road Like there's no trailhead there, but there is an actual road with a real number on it.

78
00:05:52,701 --> 00:06:00,889
Speaker 1: So at least a passing car they could flag down in the dark or an uber could find them because I was confident there was No way they could get back to their own car on foot.

79
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,560
Speaker 0: Isn't there a park person that you could call?

80
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:09,520
Speaker 0: Well, they had no way to in a park because they had a phone that they were using Google Maps on.

81
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:12,880
Speaker 0: They don't know who to call New York State New York State Park something.

82
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:16,576
Speaker 1: They could call 911 I guess but it was Google.

83
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:16,736
Speaker 0: it.

84
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:19,229
Speaker 1: you have a phone Yeah, and they didn't think to so.

85
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:38,279
Speaker 1: literally right before we encountered these people I was basically just bitching on the trail to Emily about like Like people just go out into these woods like not knowing what to do and that like almost all rescues in the woods are people Who just like walk out in tennis shoes with Google Maps and don't know anything Like never read a trail map in their life Don't know what trail markers look like have no business being out here.

86
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:42,220
Speaker 1: And then we immediately encounter two people who are clearly in this situation.

87
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:44,152
Speaker 1: So we get to the end.

88
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:44,819
Speaker 1: we get to our car.

89
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:48,673
Speaker 1: There's no other cars because there's like not many places to park except right.

90
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,657
Speaker 0: So their car wasn't there.

91
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:53,798
Speaker 1: there was one other car in that area.

92
00:06:53,819 --> 00:07:02,173
Speaker 1: if that was their car I Cannot imagine how they got to where they were from that place.

93
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,399
Speaker 1: It was not a two-hour hike.

94
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,699
Speaker 1: I think they just gotten super lost.

95
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,358
Speaker 0: So it wasn't their car.

96
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:13,899
Speaker 1: Yep, if it wasn't their car someone else was out in the woods and the Sun was about to go down.

97
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:18,740
Speaker 1: I do worry that a lot of people are hiking because it is the one of the few.

98
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,950
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, how long did it take to get from those people to your car?

99
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,000
Speaker 1: our car about an hour if you are?

100
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,420
Speaker 1: Extremely experienced at hiking because it was very rough terrain probably two hours for like an inexperienced hiker.

101
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:36,499
Speaker 0: So you couldn't be like hey follow us to our car and then Yeah, also I didn't.

102
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:41,179
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, but yeah, and then it won't be like, you know, we're gonna go this way.

103
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know if you can keep up with us.

104
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:54,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was no way but as they left they were Clearly had start beginning to have the fight that had started when they encountered us and the older woman said I told you Mm-hmm.

105
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:57,560
Speaker 1: So I'm pretty sure we they had the phone numbers to call.

106
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,189
Speaker 1: They had their phone.

107
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:58,777
Speaker 1: that was working.

108
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:04,378
Speaker 1: Worst case scenario some Rangers had to put on masks and go out in the middle of that Find them and take them to their car.

109
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:11,634
Speaker 0: Oh, well I mean if you're a Ranger and That's the level of emergency is someone is alive and healthy standing in the woods lost.

110
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:12,617
Speaker 0: That's way.

111
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:13,800
Speaker 0: That's you're fine dealing with that.

112
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,324
Speaker 0: It's your job.

113
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:14,787
Speaker 0: You're working.

114
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:18,286
Speaker 1: then anyway, it is actually most Emergencies on trails like that.

115
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:19,309
Speaker 1: right people just walk here.

116
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:27,700
Speaker 0: It's like if it's not someone bit by snake or You know fell out of a tree or they got in a fight with a bear.

117
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,604
Speaker 1: it's just You're okay Someone?

118
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,250
Speaker 1: it's like in tech.

119
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:34,977
Speaker 1: We're Monday.

120
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,779
Speaker 1: I'll tie it back before we get into the news.

121
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,840
Speaker 1: Someone asked you a tech question and you don't think I will answer your question.

122
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:45,760
Speaker 1: You think the fact that they asked this question is a warning sign that they are doing something incredibly wrong.

123
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:47,465
Speaker 1: So you ask a follow-up question.

124
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:51,840
Speaker 1: that then implies you just go down a darker and darker path as you ask more questions.

125
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:58,980
Speaker 1: XY problem, like I'm trying to get my my battery to charge for my house and you're like your house has a battery.

126
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:03,526
Speaker 1: Please explain tell me what this battery looks like Because it's a refrigerator.

127
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:04,248
Speaker 0: I worry.

128
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:10,816
Speaker 1: you were about to tell me about a room in your house filled with car batteries So you got any news.

129
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:12,703
Speaker 0: Do I have a news?

130
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:15,713
Speaker 0: All right, so this relates to our main bit today.

131
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,259
Speaker 0: It's where we got the idea for our main bit.

132
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:25,544
Speaker 0: But this person who is a wealthy person is probably not a good person because they spent their money on a Ferrari at a time Like this.

133
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:41,260
Speaker 0: hard to be a good person if you own a Ferrari Regardless of where they listen, I mean Anyway, they bought a brand new Ferrari and they immediately took it to an auto place to have because they wanted to change the seat.

134
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:46,048
Speaker 0: Right, they wanted to replace the seat that the car came with with a different seat, which is you know That's.

135
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,460
Speaker 0: you know.

136
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,940
Speaker 0: If you're already the kind of person who buys a brand new Ferrari from the dealership, right?

137
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:54,740
Speaker 0: Then you're the kind of person who would like customize the car, you know, that's reasonable whatever.

138
00:09:55,362 --> 00:10:05,353
Speaker 0: And what happened was while they were at the dealer the the repair place The repair place was like an indoor Underground garage type situation.

139
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:06,679
Speaker 0: It wasn't like outdoors, right?

140
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:18,316
Speaker 0: so there was no cell service inside the place where the car is being worked on and As soon as they like took the seat out of the car, they believe that what happened.

141
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:20,284
Speaker 0: All right Who know?

142
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:35,798
Speaker 0: I don't know how true this is, but their understanding was that there is some sort of anti tampering system in the car and The anti tampering system in the car basically said well someone's messing with this car and they're not supposed to right.

143
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,585
Speaker 0: It's a very expensive car.

144
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:58,275
Speaker 0: So the car is now going to refuse to operate until You know the Ferrari has like, you know Confirmed right that yes that the car is, you know not been stolen or vandalized right Which is you know a fine security feature on something that cost two hundred fifty thousand dollars.

145
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:14,355
Speaker 0: the problem was Ferrari, you know it cloud Ferrari wherever they are right couldn't Remotely disable the anti tampering system because the car was not in you know Cell signal area, right?

146
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,000
Speaker 0: He was underground.

147
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:27,550
Speaker 0: So I imagine they had to like I don't Get some dollies and like we or tow the car outside Somehow in order to give it give it signal and then somehow get Ferrari to unbrick it or something.

148
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:40,979
Speaker 0: It's just a you can read in this It's you know the I don't know how confirmed this is because it's just a thread on reddit But it's a believable story and there's a lot of comments discussing it and it's very interesting Because at least I have not heard of.

149
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,889
Speaker 0: I've heard of cars having you know various Problems with drms and things like hey, you can't repair your John Deere cuz the DRM and stuff like that.

150
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:54,397
Speaker 0: but this is the first I've heard about a car just being Bricked by accident.

151
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:56,950
Speaker 0: It wouldn't surprise cars being bricked remotely.

152
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:05,613
Speaker 0: Well, if they have like a low jack style GPS theft detection where the owner is like my car is gone They just remotely disable it You know intentionally.

153
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:17,147
Speaker 1: so a common occurrence of that where there's a failure that bricks a car is very specifically Inflicted upon poor people who have secured loans for a cheap car from a dodgy place.

154
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:23,835
Speaker 0: where though Yeah, repo man installs a thing or they buy the car from a financier who everybody you make your payment It gives you a code.

155
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:30,029
Speaker 1: you have to key the code into the car or the car or the car bricks itself And if the car leaves a certain geographic region, it also bricks itself.

156
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:32,509
Speaker 0: Or you could disable that system.

157
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's one.

158
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:38,070
Speaker 1: it's usually against the terms of your loan and the car will be repossessed if you disable that.

159
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:40,560
Speaker 0: How would they know if you had to disable it in some way?

160
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,625
Speaker 0: where it you?

161
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:45,330
Speaker 1: it knows That some of these systems are a phone.

162
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:49,642
Speaker 1: They have a cell phone in them basically and they phone right to check.

163
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,484
Speaker 1: so every right.

164
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:50,925
Speaker 0: so it's.

165
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:51,306
Speaker 0: it's.

166
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:57,349
Speaker 0: it's reporting correctly But you've disconnected it from the car so it can't actually brick the car.

167
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:00,822
Speaker 0: Like you take the system out.

168
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,070
Speaker 0: you put it like in your house.

169
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,942
Speaker 0: It thinks you're just keeping the car at your house and the car works.

170
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:05,263
Speaker 0: Yep.

171
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:06,830
Speaker 1: It's hard to say that might be moderately difficult.

172
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,783
Speaker 1: I also don't think the car didn't say it'd be easy.

173
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:09,085
Speaker 0: It's just.

174
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:09,830
Speaker 0: it's just possible.

175
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:10,070
Speaker 0: Yeah.

176
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,510
Speaker 1: But also the kind of person who is in that situation probably does not have the bandwidth to do that level of yeah.

177
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:23,386
Speaker 0: if you were smart enough to yeah, if you had the the the Skills to do that then you have the skills to make money to pay for a car.

178
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:30,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, right You could sell those skills to other people who need the services and then you don't need those services anymore.

179
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:32,142
Speaker 1: but the moral in general was to get to.

180
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:49,581
Speaker 1: the main bit is Generally if something requires any sort of communication or has like a security system that can be accessed remotely you are potentially very much at risk of that communication link failing in some way like if I'm on a trip and my creative cloud needs to Be renewed because I haven't logged in in a while.

181
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:50,245
Speaker 1: I don't have internet.

182
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:51,110
Speaker 1: I'm just effed.

183
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,318
Speaker 0: So is any other news what is going?

184
00:13:55,358 --> 00:14:01,178
Speaker 0: so I just want to mention that tomorrow is you know Because we previously talked about Apple's iPad.

185
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,828
Speaker 0: I watch event which was in September and there should have been iPhones then and there weren't.

186
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:13,166
Speaker 0: and The iPhone event is actually tomorrow the the 13th of October which might be today for most of you listening If anyone's the one person listening.

187
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:17,744
Speaker 0: So yeah, we thanks Apple for putting the Apple event one day after.

188
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:21,620
Speaker 0: I need tech news twice in a row I should raise a complaint Apple.

189
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:30,116
Speaker 0: You're really messing up the gig night schedule here But we'll see if I replace this iPhone 7 or not because it's still working Fantastically and I don't really go out.

190
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:34,450
Speaker 1: I was about to say I feel like I'm not like even if my ancient ancient phone.

191
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:39,948
Speaker 0: Alright, I mean there's a chance that the new iPhone has like all the features I want and it's perfect.

192
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,856
Speaker 0: and it there I heard There is gonna be a smaller one.

193
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,664
Speaker 0: So I you know, it might be.

194
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:45,637
Speaker 0: if I am gonna get that one Why would I wait?

195
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,830
Speaker 0: I would just get it immediately.

196
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:50,684
Speaker 1: But if you're not going anywhere just wait a year right at the end.

197
00:14:50,725 --> 00:15:01,022
Speaker 0: the neck these the middle Right little update to exactly right exactly if they're not unbelievably perfect if there's like if there's any kind of a Say what's up for another year?

198
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:07,810
Speaker 1: Yeah Like I feel like I if my phone broke I wouldn't even replace it until after COVID calms down.

199
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:11,828
Speaker 0: Uh, I still need the phone.

200
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,334
Speaker 0: There's some things.

201
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:18,070
Speaker 0: the phone does that like the app iPad and I watch don't I guess navigating?

202
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,646
Speaker 1: No, cuz my watch can do that without the phone.

203
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:25,145
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah, I don't really need the phone right now.

204
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:29,509
Speaker 0: Okay So I do use the phone.

205
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:31,730
Speaker 1: So it's about there.

206
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,590
Speaker 1: I mean I make all my phone calls online.

207
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,650
Speaker 1: Oh, and I also have a Google Voice number that isn't even tied to the phone that I can just use directly on a computer.

208
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:39,660
Speaker 0: So no, I use the phone to me.

209
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,147
Speaker 0: I could make phone calls on the iPad though.

210
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:47,470
Speaker 1: Yeah So I stumbled onto this while I was looking for an unrelated thing and it didn't make a lot of big news.

211
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,822
Speaker 1: But basically what's going on here?

212
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:49,710
Speaker 1: Spotify?

213
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:55,657
Speaker 1: One of the all the different music streaming services are all Really fighting over market share.

214
00:15:55,737 --> 00:16:05,569
Speaker 0: like that industry is really locked in a race to the bottom for a lot of reasons And it's actually I just want to say as some you know, not speaking for my employer in any way, right?

215
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:12,498
Speaker 0: This is my own personal talking just in case I don't think You know, I do work for a music publisher, right?

216
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:25,389
Speaker 0: So the race to the bottom is a problem for Music people in the music industry because what you have here is, you know, we finally escaped mostly, you know Music piracy, right?

217
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,756
Speaker 0: So now it's like musicians.

218
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:32,230
Speaker 0: songwriters are getting paid when people listen to their music on Spotify or Apple music or whatever.

219
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:52,224
Speaker 0: Right people are legally paying or this advertising supporting, you know people getting paid when someone listens to their songs, which is good You know because even if I don't believe in copyright laws, I believe that creative people who are making art should get paid for it By some mechanism, even if that mechanism is not the existing awful copyright

220
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:52,806
Speaker 1: capitalism,

221
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:53,629
Speaker 0: right?

222
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:59,907
Speaker 0: Exactly However, what happens here is you have Spotify Apple music etc.

223
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:08,640
Speaker 0: competing Right on features and also on price Right and by competing on price there.

224
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,626
Speaker 0: They want to lower their price, right?

225
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:12,010
Speaker 0: They don't want to charge a lot of money.

226
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:15,665
Speaker 0: They want to have more users because Apple doesn't actually want to sell Apple music.

227
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:17,532
Speaker 0: They want to sell iPhone Right.

228
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:22,750
Speaker 0: Spotify does want to sell Spotify, but they can't if someone's undercutting them, right?

229
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:31,410
Speaker 0: They're happy to lower their price to get the most users Especially since a lot of their money does come from the free users who are listening to ads.

230
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:42,110
Speaker 0: Therefore more users is better because then an ad Spotify ad cost more because they will have more listens And that hurts, you know people always talk about Spotify not paying music people anything.

231
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,812
Speaker 0: Well, guess what?

232
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:49,189
Speaker 0: Spotify charging less hurts music people because now there's less money to divide amongst same reason.

233
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:49,450
Speaker 0: writers.

234
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:57,012
Speaker 1: Why the fact that a triple-a video game cost the same number of dollars today in 2020 that it cost in 1989?

235
00:17:57,012 --> 00:18:13,199
Speaker 0: exactly the songwriters the musicians the music industry wants Spotify to charge more money which You know and then therefore there would be more money to divide amongst everyone who has music on Spotify Which makes total sense from their perspective.

236
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,709
Speaker 0: but charging 50 bucks a month makes no sense because I'm not paying that.

237
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:24,274
Speaker 1: Yep Well, especially that's in the era when it became more difficult for me to pirate good music like around the time I left our IT.

238
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:31,429
Speaker 1: there was like an era of I didn't pirate a lot of music, but there wasn't streaming services yet I just didn't listen to as much new music.

239
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:33,800
Speaker 1: yeah, a lot of people are like that.

240
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,030
Speaker 1: a lot of people music is a Secondary concern or a background concern.

241
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,704
Speaker 1: They're not really gonna pay for the primary activity of listening to albums.

242
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:49,050
Speaker 0: Like that is a much smaller, you know You know YouTube videos that are a song or a music video are still like the number one, right?

243
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,024
Speaker 0: But those all have ads on them.

244
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:59,590
Speaker 0: Yep I mean you can also choose not to see those ads but that's all separate conversation anyway And I'm pretty sure a YouTube view is gonna get you more money than a spot a Spotify listen.

245
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:02,890
Speaker 1: So it's really hard to compete on price because what we just talked about.

246
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:11,472
Speaker 1: It's also hard to compete on features because there's only so many features you can give someone around listening to WAV files Pretty much.

247
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:18,670
Speaker 0: Yeah or mp3s or whatever kind of file you got listening to the modulation of air around your body.

248
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:25,570
Speaker 1: There's only so many ways to make that experience more pleasant that are not even if there are newer better ways.

249
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,296
Speaker 0: We haven't thought of them yet.

250
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,340
Speaker 0: They're harder to think of.

251
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:33,174
Speaker 1: Yep, but like make a playlist get Recommendations like that stuff.

252
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:34,338
Speaker 1: everyone has that stuff.

253
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:38,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can say though the Spotify recommendations are like I could switch to Apple music.

254
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:40,018
Speaker 0: I have all these Apple devices, right?

255
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:45,525
Speaker 1: It wouldn't you know, I found all the services Give me the same level of like high quality recommendations.

256
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:46,450
Speaker 1: They're all very accurate.

257
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:49,881
Speaker 0: Like I don't know what the Spotify recommendations have been better.

258
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:51,004
Speaker 0: I think lately.

259
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:52,670
Speaker 0: so it's like that's yeah.

260
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,370
Speaker 1: Well, it's really like YouTube actually gives me the best recommendations.

261
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:01,010
Speaker 1: But and I think that might sometimes I listen to more music on YouTube than I do other services.

262
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,596
Speaker 1: So YouTube has more data about me.

263
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:04,904
Speaker 0: So that's also true as I do list.

264
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:06,510
Speaker 0: I have listened to more music on Spotify.

265
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,789
Speaker 0: Maybe that's why it's bright.

266
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:13,546
Speaker 1: So so the third way you can compete is lock in and that is where they're going now.

267
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:32,624
Speaker 1: according to a bunch of articles I found Spotify is going after developers of apps basically threatening to cut off all API access if they violate the terms of service and one particular clause that says you cannot help people migrate Anything to another service Under any circumstances.

268
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:43,123
Speaker 1: if you use our API's Not even like and I manually export my Spotify playlist Not that I have that many not easily like you can do a manual process.

269
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:43,645
Speaker 0: Oh, here I go.

270
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:56,270
Speaker 0: You can go to a You can go to a Spotify playlist and you can right-click and go to share and do Huh, so basically there's a time you can share it somehow.

271
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,757
Speaker 1: Yep, here's a public.

272
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:09,874
Speaker 1: that will basically be your single point of interface for all the streaming music services You subscribe to and do cool stuff and basically all of them now just recently Removed their.

273
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:15,430
Speaker 1: take my playlist from Spotify and recreate it on another service because Spotify is cutting them off of the API's.

274
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,312
Speaker 1: Spotify.

275
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,379
Speaker 0: the point of those.

276
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:23,545
Speaker 0: wouldn't the point of those third-party Services be that you would make playlists on those third parties and then they would?

277
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:30,544
Speaker 0: that way you could mix like yes Exclusive and Apple music songs together in a playlist that would be on their service and not on Spotify.

278
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,416
Speaker 1: Yes, but people have Exist.

279
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:40,570
Speaker 1: a lot of people use Spotify for a long time Like I don't know Spotify account and made a bunch of playlists in there and they want to copy those playlists to a different service.

280
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:47,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I had not realized that you there is not an easy way in the Spotify UI to Export a playlist.

281
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:50,223
Speaker 1: and now that Spotify is going after the users of their API.

282
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,390
Speaker 1: It's very clear why that's not easy.

283
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:59,730
Speaker 0: Hmm I mean iTunes I'm pretty sure still supports like old m3u playlists.

284
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:09,508
Speaker 1: in fact Their terms of service even specifically calls out you cannot transfer any content of any kind to quote another music service that competes with Spotify.

285
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,552
Speaker 0: I You know.

286
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:20,318
Speaker 0: while I agree, you know if I make a playlist It's kind of bullshit that they don't have a way to export it great except for obviously manually writing it down and retyping it Right.

287
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:32,031
Speaker 0: Yeah But I do agree actually That if you have a playlist that was generated by Spotify's AI for example discover weekly release radar Right.

288
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:47,803
Speaker 0: It's like you can kind of see a valid argument for like, okay, you're using Spotify to generate your taking advantage of the AI on Spotify to generate a really good playlist for you and all the data it has and then you're gonna listen to that playlist on Apple music and Spotify is not gonna get any money for it.

289
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:49,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though they did all the work.

290
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:52,554
Speaker 0: That's there's some validity to that Argument there.

291
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:55,145
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think most people have playlists.

292
00:22:55,185 --> 00:22:56,450
Speaker 1: They made themselves like mixed.

293
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,468
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you make a playlist by hand, let me see if I made this playlist by hand.

294
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:02,390
Speaker 0: I Did.

295
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:06,388
Speaker 0: and yeah, it doesn't seem like there is a way to export it.

296
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:08,414
Speaker 0: So, oh wait.

297
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,538
Speaker 0: No, there's a download button.

298
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,530
Speaker 0: Oh, no that just downloads all the songs into the cat.

299
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:13,789
Speaker 1: So I found one app.

300
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,297
Speaker 1: I think it's called free your music.

301
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:15,478
Speaker 1: wonder.

302
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:25,828
Speaker 1: there's a million apps that do this stuff and they Have a statement where they were like We're gonna keep offering the service because we don't use Spotify's API or SDK to make it work.

303
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:30,053
Speaker 1: So they some sort of scraping Nice.

304
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:32,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure if I really wanted to I could do it right now.

305
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:39,870
Speaker 0: I know how to computer but I For the perspective of just a Spotify user I right-clicked on a playlist and there was no option to do it.

306
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:51,207
Speaker 1: Yeah But I think it is a worrying sign when Spotify starts going after the third way the lock-in path Because the lock-in path usually is the sign of a failing service.

307
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:53,569
Speaker 0: that yeah Well, I mean that works.

308
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:57,617
Speaker 0: I don't think Spotify is a failing service But I do think that there's just.

309
00:23:57,677 --> 00:23:58,722
Speaker 0: there's just less things.

310
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:12,703
Speaker 0: all the certain music services they're running out of things to to compete on because the they already went through this process of getting all the different musicians and major Artists to relent and have their music on the services.

311
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,730
Speaker 0: So they're not really competing on library anymore.

312
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,493
Speaker 0: It's like you're real.

313
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:17,138
Speaker 0: It's really hard in nowadays.

314
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:20,570
Speaker 0: It used to be like Beatles aren't on there Led Zeppelin's not on there.

315
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:25,535
Speaker 0: I remember that now I did right and now it's like Everyone's on everything.

316
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:27,783
Speaker 0: It's like it's really hard to think of a band.

317
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:29,650
Speaker 1: That's you get you another situation.

318
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:36,880
Speaker 1: There's enough content out there that where if a particular act isn't on one service the people using that service Just won't even know that band exists.

319
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:47,058
Speaker 1: like welcome to the modern world Yep So in some other news Scott's always mad about Elon Musk and SpaceX.

320
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:51,210
Speaker 0: Well, you know all rich guys, you know, but he's a particularly bad rich guy.

321
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,450
Speaker 0: He's like as close to you know, real-world Lex Luthor's you're gonna get in.

322
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:01,280
Speaker 1: He's getting real close to like the the company OCP in the Robocop Cinematic Universe.

323
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,440
Speaker 0: Basically, I think that's what I think he does that on purpose.

324
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,504
Speaker 0: I think it's like it's a goal.

325
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:06,730
Speaker 0: I don't think it's unconscious.

326
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,701
Speaker 0: I think he's like yes, that's what I want to be.

327
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:11,357
Speaker 1: I just imagine at some point He's the one sitting in the room.

328
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:13,190
Speaker 1: Whereas someone were you here in the background?

329
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,103
Speaker 1: Somebody call a paramedic cuz the robot just fucking like burnt someone.

330
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:22,869
Speaker 0: But anyway, that probably has happened Literally and already right effectively the same thing.

331
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:28,550
Speaker 1: So we're not gonna talk about the billionaire problem and we're not gonna talk about like injuries at the Tesla factory and shit.

332
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:31,930
Speaker 1: I think I heard so the news and there's a lot to this topic.

333
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,689
Speaker 1: We're only gonna cover the top top top news.

334
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:40,689
Speaker 1: But if you didn't see it The Pentagon is basically contracting SpaceX to do the thing that we always assumed it would do.

335
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:49,110
Speaker 1: SpaceX and space exploration with humans, especially when the commercial side is involved is primarily not about exploration and research.

336
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,477
Speaker 1: It's primarily about the military.

337
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:53,403
Speaker 1: That is how it has always been.

338
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:55,289
Speaker 1: That is how it likely always will be.

339
00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:07,096
Speaker 1: and now people are reacting to this news that SpaceX is going to deliver a rocket that is designed to deliver a military payload Anywhere on earth within an hour.

340
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:11,630
Speaker 0: Well, I think what is clear, you know, what has happened, which we sort of realized years ago.

341
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,781
Speaker 0: But I think other people are starting to realize.

342
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:17,738
Speaker 0: as you think about, you know, the so-called Military industrial complex.

343
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:22,994
Speaker 0: right you think of these companies like Lockheed Martin Boeing Dietoles, right?

344
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:42,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, you think about these companies that make weapons defense machinery submarines, you know, right and they're all private companies that are in league with you know, the the Government, right and we give a lot of our tax money to them via corruption, but some legitimacy, but some not.

345
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:47,430
Speaker 0: right mostly not and That's just been what the US is all about.

346
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:53,706
Speaker 0: And now what's happened is SpaceX slash Tesla slash Elon Musk industries, whatever the fuck you want to call it, right.

347
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:57,830
Speaker 0: at first Appeared to not be one of those companies.

348
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:02,027
Speaker 0: It was like a. it was almost like a consumer facing thing like buy a Tesla.

349
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:02,730
Speaker 0: you could buy a Tesla.

350
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,741
Speaker 0: You can't buy fucking anything Lockheed Martin sells.

351
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,249
Speaker 0: I don't sell a damn thing to you, right?

352
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,954
Speaker 0: So you don't cuss people.

353
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:22,948
Speaker 0: does normal people citizens right who aren't involved in directly don't view those companies The same way as they view SpaceX or Tesla or whatever the fuck he's got going on over there, right, but really there's no different.

354
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:28,105
Speaker 0: at this point It's like yeah this SpaceX slash Tesla slash whatever just is one of those companies.

355
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:29,710
Speaker 0: It's not really any different.

356
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:38,703
Speaker 0: So this news is basically like if the news said Pentagon has contract with Lockheed Martin to make rocket that delivers weapons, right?

357
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would no one would get no one would give a shit.

358
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,101
Speaker 0: Well, this is that this is that news just different company.

359
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:52,441
Speaker 0: Yes, the news should actually be SpaceX steals contract from Lockheed Martin, you know Lockheed Martin stock goes down and SpaceX stock goes up there.

360
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:53,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're in the same industry.

361
00:27:53,530 --> 00:28:00,819
Speaker 1: There's a very important point people really need to understand about like NASA and space with the US government Is that NASA does not do everything on its own.

362
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:09,570
Speaker 1: it never did at any point and these private companies are all involved on Government contracts and it's very complex how this stuff gets done, but all of that is valid.

363
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,569
Speaker 1: There's a lot of valid criticism around the situation going on here.

364
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:20,430
Speaker 1: Especially why would be should we be investing so much in the military industrial complex during a global pandemic and the rise of fascism, etc.

365
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:22,114
Speaker 1: All valid points.

366
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:28,678
Speaker 1: the only thing I want to point out to the nerds who are mad about this Is that you need to be mad about it for the right reasons.

367
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:42,430
Speaker 1: the capability that they're describing is not Particularly novel and is going to happen Anyway, similar to how the internet arose from the military industrial complex and then became also a private sector thing.

368
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:56,378
Speaker 1: If you talk about the US military in particular not all militaries on earth this primarily only applies to the US military because there are almost no other militaries on earth that have the concept of Real like global force projection capabilities.

369
00:28:57,081 --> 00:28:59,830
Speaker 1: the US military is primarily a logistics organization.

370
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:04,301
Speaker 1: the violence doing is actually like the end stop.

371
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:13,866
Speaker 1: there's like 50 steps before the violence happens at the end and The power of the US military and the value of it to the US as a entity.

372
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:17,670
Speaker 1: and again, yes There are a lot of problems with the power of the US as an entity.

373
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:20,740
Speaker 1: I'm not arguing that this is not the case right.

374
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:29,330
Speaker 0: the main argument would be like yeah all these positive things It is doing we could just have that money go to a different nonviolent organization to do the same damn thing.

375
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:29,793
Speaker 0: but

376
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:30,478
Speaker 1: basically we could

377
00:29:30,498 --> 00:29:42,961
Speaker 0: have invented the internet at the Technological research found it or whatever, you know something like that some other institution that didn't have an end goal of violence Right and gave them the same tax money to invent the internet since the

378
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:45,669
Speaker 1: beginning of the modern era like World War.

379
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:51,370
Speaker 1: one Type war has primarily began been and operate an exercise in logistics.

380
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:56,970
Speaker 1: So the most important part of the US military is actually probably transcom or u.s.

381
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:03,749
Speaker 1: Transcom which literally just get shit from one place to another place very similar like the same technique.

382
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like We've been in like we've people talk about forever war right?

383
00:30:07,943 --> 00:30:09,709
Speaker 0: It's a great this forever war in Afghanistan.

384
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:14,347
Speaker 0: It's true Yeah, you know how much we don't make anything in fucking Afghanistan.

385
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:17,057
Speaker 0: It's not like Weapons factories there, right?

386
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:21,308
Speaker 0: It's not a command and conquer where your factory is five feet from your tank.

387
00:30:22,432 --> 00:30:27,830
Speaker 0: The the tanks and whatever they're using over there is made far far away and we've been forever warring.

388
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:40,650
Speaker 0: We are constantly delivering and retrieving people food staff equipment right Non-stop right that is the most of the operation is the moving of the stuff.

389
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:49,490
Speaker 0: Yeah in fact There's only one difference big using of the stuff is Costing way less energy and way less money than the delivering and retrieving of the stuff.

390
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:57,035
Speaker 1: there is basically only one difference between military logistics for transportation and Civilian logistics for transportation.

391
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:02,550
Speaker 1: the latter the primary goal is low cost and or efficiency.

392
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:06,964
Speaker 1: The primary goal of military is cost is not a factor.

393
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:12,155
Speaker 1: get it there as fast as possible The military side Also safely.

394
00:31:12,195 --> 00:31:12,375
Speaker 1: Yeah.

395
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:14,360
Speaker 0: Well without anyone compromise.

396
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,588
Speaker 0: Well, not only without anyone stealing it.

397
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:24,145
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah securely, but not necessarily All right, not safe for the people doing the delivering.

398
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:28,360
Speaker 0: they might get blown up But securely and that no one steals it now messes with it.

399
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,464
Speaker 1: This is where it gets.

400
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,330
Speaker 1: This is why this is such a complicated issue.

401
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,059
Speaker 1: There is an overlap between those two.

402
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:41,330
Speaker 1: when it comes to things like disaster response Like imagine if a Chernobyl happened today or a horrible hurricane big disaster.

403
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:46,766
Speaker 1: The type of logistics you need to get help to people is the same logistics.

404
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:47,890
Speaker 1: You need to get harm to people.

405
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:51,709
Speaker 1: It's military style logistics not civilian style logistic, right?

406
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:59,814
Speaker 0: Right UPS is not going to successfully deliver right water blankets Whatever you need.

407
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:07,279
Speaker 1: ask someone getting paid that little to risk their life to deliver something somewhere But someone in a military type organization.

408
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:09,930
Speaker 1: their job is to risk their life to do the thing.

409
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:14,670
Speaker 1: So what this technology is fundamentally?

410
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:22,630
Speaker 1: Basically, the c17 is like the way Cargo gets delivered in up like when you got to get it there fast and it takes a while.

411
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,453
Speaker 1: It can take about a day.

412
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:28,150
Speaker 1: This is a rocket that can deliver that amount of payload like one cargo container.

413
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:31,883
Speaker 0: Oh a c17 is worth of payload anywhere on earth in an hour.

414
00:32:32,526 --> 00:32:33,369
Speaker 0: That's a lot of stuff.

415
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:34,232
Speaker 0: Yes It's not.

416
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:40,036
Speaker 0: that's not like a that's not like a box in pub G right that is like supply I guess the way.

417
00:32:40,076 --> 00:32:42,470
Speaker 0: I guess since it's going to space the weight also matters, right?

418
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,080
Speaker 0: You probably couldn't deliver even though you could fit several tanks in like a c17.

419
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, you couldn't.

420
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:49,390
Speaker 0: you couldn't deliver tanks via space.

421
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:49,953
Speaker 0: They're too heavy.

422
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:51,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you could deliver.

423
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,888
Speaker 0: you could deliver a planes worth of food.

424
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:56,038
Speaker 1: now I do not know for all my food.

425
00:32:56,238 --> 00:33:00,510
Speaker 1: I do not know a lot about modern transportation infrastructure in the military.

426
00:33:00,852 --> 00:33:03,229
Speaker 1: I don't know a lot about how much they see 17 can deliver.

427
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:09,008
Speaker 1: I do know the big the u.s This does not make c17s anymore and there's actually starting to be a crazy.

428
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:12,509
Speaker 1: is now The existing c17s don't break any?

429
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:16,121
Speaker 0: Okay But I mean they also use boats.

430
00:33:16,484 --> 00:33:18,916
Speaker 1: boats are good Yeah, but they don't serve the same purpose.

431
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:23,569
Speaker 0: boats take orders of magnitude longer, of course, but they could deliver way more shit Yep.

432
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:30,690
Speaker 1: But imagine a disaster where we need to get supplies to a town to survive the next week.

433
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:36,489
Speaker 1: What before like a supply chain can be created to get through the disaster area to get there.

434
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:50,970
Speaker 1: Military logistics is the only way to do that and this type of technology can be used equally to Deliver harm doing materials to do harm and deliver life-saving materials to save lives.

435
00:33:51,313 --> 00:33:53,510
Speaker 1: The problem is never the technology.

436
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:58,610
Speaker 1: It's the priorities of the civilization that's funding it and how they choose to use those resources.

437
00:33:59,032 --> 00:33:59,715
Speaker 1: There are great.

438
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:00,520
Speaker 0: there is a question.

439
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:07,130
Speaker 0: there is a question though always to be asked though It's like, you know when you have airplanes how much is a rocket ever really necessary?

440
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,730
Speaker 0: Like when is the airplane not good enough and you need to use the rocket?

441
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:14,706
Speaker 1: So the difference is and this is where I'm being a little soft because I don't like.

442
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:17,995
Speaker 1: I am NOT an expert That's at all at this point.

443
00:34:18,377 --> 00:34:22,730
Speaker 1: I'm an expert in like this type this technology from 50 years ago because I'm a nerd.

444
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,130
Speaker 1: Basically.

445
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:35,330
Speaker 1: Imagine you have to deliver Important supplies that only are available from certain places to somewhere on the other side of the globe like a remote location.

446
00:34:36,315 --> 00:34:37,222
Speaker 1: It could take 20.

447
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:38,409
Speaker 0: how often does this happen?

448
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,454
Speaker 1: Disasters and wars like.

449
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:41,777
Speaker 1: rarely this is not.

450
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:52,409
Speaker 1: you don't use this like every day like saying we're going to use this Technology is like on the level of we're gonna launch a rocket Literally because it's launching a rocket.

451
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:58,550
Speaker 1: So this is a capability that it probably does make sense for humans to have.

452
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:05,667
Speaker 1: The problems you should be railing at are all the problems We already talked about not the existence of this specific technology.

453
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,021
Speaker 0: also Keep in mind the you know, the the military.

454
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:11,050
Speaker 0: the budget is so ridiculous, right?

455
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:11,915
Speaker 0: There's so much money.

456
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:17,422
Speaker 0: most of these things these contracts They hand out to companies or whatever to develop this or that.

457
00:35:17,984 --> 00:35:20,915
Speaker 0: a lot of it is just pie in the sky Stuff that it's like.

458
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,804
Speaker 0: maybe they invent it and don't use it.

459
00:35:22,964 --> 00:35:26,439
Speaker 0: It does never goes into production It never proves to actually be useful.

460
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,303
Speaker 0: Maybe they try.

461
00:35:27,343 --> 00:35:28,870
Speaker 0: it doesn't even work, right?

462
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:31,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know that they're constantly doing that stuff.

463
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,277
Speaker 0: That's like every damn day.

464
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:37,294
Speaker 0: if you go look, you know send some FYI requests or look at stuff That's already public at like.

465
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:40,325
Speaker 0: what is the Pentagon spending its research money on?

466
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:41,650
Speaker 0: what's DARPA up to whatever?

467
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,846
Speaker 0: It's like you're gonna see a lot of crazy shit that they're working on and get mad.

468
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:46,528
Speaker 0: So think about it.

469
00:35:46,568 --> 00:35:58,832
Speaker 1: this way though It's like the slowest way to do something is civilian boat transport and then there's faster but more costly not just in terms of dollars but in terms of risk in terms of climate change in terms of Societal

470
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:03,185
Speaker 0: I'd say the slowest way would be civilian pigeon transport.

471
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:04,810
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on where you're going.

472
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,878
Speaker 1: Let's say it's like you're trying to deliver something.

473
00:36:06,939 --> 00:36:09,770
Speaker 0: I guess I guess a pigeon flies faster than a person walking.

474
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:26,516
Speaker 1: let's say you're trying to deliver critical X like technological and human aid supplies from military based in the United States like a supply depot to like the Horn of Africa for some reason or Antarctica because there's some like us.

475
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:30,969
Speaker 1: a science of the thing happened down there and we got to get some supplies down there.

476
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,190
Speaker 0: Okay You know what the thing to steal?

477
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:36,156
Speaker 1: That's great.

478
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:49,498
Speaker 1: Now the thing has all of our guns And he learned how to use a. Anyway, it's time for things of the day.

479
00:36:51,366 --> 00:36:52,579
Speaker 0: The thing of our day.

480
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:55,311
Speaker 1: Not that thing though.

481
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:59,626
Speaker 1: It is adjacent to the thing Tenuously your thing of the day at least.

482
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:01,190
Speaker 0: What was it again?

483
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,096
Speaker 1: All right, so scale abroad.

484
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:05,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's Halloween It's Halloween times.

485
00:37:05,945 --> 00:37:10,480
Speaker 0: So the skeleton energy is is back especially because the Home Depot skeleton exists.

486
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:13,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to buy that Home Depot skeleton.

487
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,840
Speaker 0: so bad, I don't want to give Home Depot any money I know but I want that skeleton.

488
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:22,543
Speaker 1: I want to just assemble it in the park courtyard behind my building in the middle of the night and never say a word about it.

489
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,389
Speaker 0: I Think people would know because they'd see it get delivered.

490
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:27,460
Speaker 1: I know I got to figure out a way to make this happen.

491
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:31,427
Speaker 1: Maybe I should set it up in a public park in the middle of the night anyway, anyway.

492
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:35,154
Speaker 0: so this person has a nice fake skeleton.

493
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:45,801
Speaker 0: they got you know, and They put in a t-shirt on it that says What hide-and-seek champion or something about of 2020 of 2020?

494
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:47,408
Speaker 0: And you think you're watching this video.

495
00:37:47,428 --> 00:38:00,051
Speaker 0: It's just a little Twitter video and you're thinking when this video is going They're just gonna hide the skeleton somewhere and I thought the video was gonna be like, okay Then they would play hide-and-seek with a kid and the kid would find the skeleton or right.

496
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:03,997
Speaker 0: but No, the video goes to a much more hilarious place.

497
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:06,868
Speaker 0: you can That I did not see coming.

498
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:10,500
Speaker 0: and mad props to whoever made this video and thought of this clever idea.

499
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:12,650
Speaker 0: You are a skeleton champion.

500
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:14,840
Speaker 1: It is no spoilers to watch the video.

501
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,647
Speaker 1: The video is 39 seconds long.

502
00:38:16,807 --> 00:38:18,574
Speaker 1: Like I think you can you can watch.

503
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:19,578
Speaker 0: I think you have 39 seconds.

504
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,895
Speaker 0: You're wasted a lot more than 39 seconds.

505
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:22,440
Speaker 0: Listen to us.

506
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,379
Speaker 1: We've talked about this video for well more than 39 seconds already.

507
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:33,000
Speaker 1: I know right, but all I'll say is that this type of prank very much has good night for flying energy.

508
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:38,100
Speaker 1: Mmm, like it's that level which is my favorite kind of prank on earth.

509
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:47,398
Speaker 1: So, you know, you might have a house and if you have a house in the US, there's a decent chance at some point Raccoons are gonna get into your fucking house.

510
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:52,259
Speaker 0: Like if you live in an area with our coons, there's no like raccoons in Florida, right?

511
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:53,386
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are.

512
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:55,620
Speaker 1: there's raccoons I think almost everywhere in North America.

513
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:57,686
Speaker 0: I've never seen a raccoon in Florida.

514
00:38:57,706 --> 00:39:00,113
Speaker 1: raccoons are very widespread.

515
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:02,360
Speaker 1: Do I need to pull up the map of raccoon habitat?

516
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,370
Speaker 0: I've seen I mean there's raccoons clearly everywhere north of that right?

517
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:10,980
Speaker 1: Let's see a map of where our raccoons in North America.

518
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,093
Speaker 1: Let me find a map all of North America literally all of it except the alright.

519
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:16,718
Speaker 0: Well, I've never seen a record.

520
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:19,177
Speaker 1: also much of Central America.

521
00:39:19,197 --> 00:39:22,680
Speaker 1: Oh In fact what last time we were in Costa Rica.

522
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:28,303
Speaker 1: but if I remember a great moment, we're eating dinner at this fancy outdoor place and Bunch of raccoons.

523
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:36,440
Speaker 1: just kind of wander up and like I feel a tug at my leg and I look down and there's a raccoon Just like tugging on my pants and when I look down at him, he holds his hands up and starts begging.

524
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:38,685
Speaker 0: All right, you know, they're smart.

525
00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:39,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, they know what's up.

526
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:49,318
Speaker 1: So basically if raccoons get into your house like what do you you call an animal like rescue type plays they will show up and Deal with the raccoons.

527
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:51,609
Speaker 0: That's not what we did.

528
00:39:52,094 --> 00:39:52,619
Speaker 1: What did you do?

529
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,808
Speaker 0: We just locked the trash.

530
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:56,120
Speaker 0: We just locked the trash cans harder.

531
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:04,027
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking like if they're in your house like they're in in the house And they're living in the shed.

532
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,778
Speaker 0: we kept them out that we did never let them get in the house.

533
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:07,440
Speaker 0: they were always outside.

534
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's like they don't get in your house unless you don't maintain your house.

535
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,510
Speaker 1: But it happens like there's ways raccoons get in.

536
00:40:13,093 --> 00:40:14,640
Speaker 1: so when they're actually in your house.

537
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,349
Speaker 1: What this video is is it's a channel that I subscribe to.

538
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:19,232
Speaker 1: that is great called gates.

539
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:20,857
Speaker 1: wildlife control these people.

540
00:40:20,897 --> 00:40:26,140
Speaker 1: there are Inhumane people who will just like murder them and like get them out of your house.

541
00:40:26,822 --> 00:40:30,735
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but there are much better places that usually charge less money to.

542
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:36,702
Speaker 1: that will get rid of them But they'll do it in a nice way and this is one of those companies and this yeah I would.

543
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:42,480
Speaker 0: my guess would be you get some sort of bait in a trap that doesn't hurt them and then you take the track Anything you do with like a straight.

544
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,754
Speaker 0: It's basically the same thing you just supposed to do with stray cats is where you catch them.

545
00:40:45,815 --> 00:40:47,964
Speaker 0: you take them to get spayed or neutered Then you release them again.

546
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:48,929
Speaker 1: So this video is that.

547
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:51,260
Speaker 1: but what's cool about it is, you know, we're in our friend group.

548
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,860
Speaker 1: We've been having a lot of fun talking about people failing to correctly fell a tree.

549
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:58,290
Speaker 1: So this is a video that sort of explains.

550
00:40:58,651 --> 00:41:03,480
Speaker 1: here is how you safely and humanely Get raccoons and raccoon babies out of your attic.

551
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:04,826
Speaker 1: Like what does this look like?

552
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,684
Speaker 1: and the guy explains every step of the way like alright, I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that.

553
00:41:09,105 --> 00:41:11,314
Speaker 1: and the best part about these videos is the baby box.

554
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:12,780
Speaker 1: because basically what they do?

555
00:41:13,344 --> 00:41:22,000
Speaker 1: they scare the mom away and Then they get the babies out and they put the babies in a box that can't be open from the inside But could be opened by the outside.

556
00:41:22,444 --> 00:41:33,460
Speaker 1: They leave it outside The place they scared the mom out of because they know the mom is gonna come back that night Get the babies and take them somewhere else like and it explains in detail this whole process.

557
00:41:34,104 --> 00:41:40,280
Speaker 1: Not only do you get all that detail and you'll learn a lot But you get to see a whole bunch of really cute baby raccoons.

558
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:47,504
Speaker 0: I think the key thing there obviously is you don't want to leave, you know, after you trap the raccoons You can't.

559
00:41:47,524 --> 00:41:48,410
Speaker 0: you can't just leave them there.

560
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:52,406
Speaker 0: You got to make sure you get the trap Like failure mode.

561
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,188
Speaker 0: I think that happens.

562
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:58,620
Speaker 0: a lot is like people will trap animals and like forget and then that's about people will do that.

563
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:05,052
Speaker 1: People will trap a mother raccoon leave release her in the woods somewhere But leave the babies in their attic and then that leads to a tragedy.

564
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:06,940
Speaker 1: like that happens a lot because people are stupid.

565
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:12,278
Speaker 1: This video just goes into all that detail and it's just fascinating and adorable.

566
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,411
Speaker 1: In the meta moment we're not reading stuff.

567
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:20,524
Speaker 1: cuz where we give enough time I don't know what you want.

568
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:21,850
Speaker 0: and in the meta moment.

569
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,420
Speaker 0: There are no conventions on the schedule whatsoever.

570
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:25,587
Speaker 1: Thanks unplugged.

571
00:42:25,607 --> 00:42:27,700
Speaker 1: zero finally announced that they are canceled.

572
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:30,630
Speaker 0: Thus we knew that they were canceled for a long time.

573
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:35,093
Speaker 0: still pretty sure there are not even any online conventions for us to go to.

574
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:38,368
Speaker 1: Maybe there are online convention.

575
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:45,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, tell us or tell the convention to have us And maybe we'll go to it or something.

576
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:45,813
Speaker 0: I don't know.

577
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:47,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've done a bunch of stuff at cons.

578
00:42:47,842 --> 00:42:51,040
Speaker 1: I have the video from our panel at PAX online.

579
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:53,871
Speaker 1: I have a director's cut of that.

580
00:42:54,112 --> 00:42:55,700
Speaker 1: that will be up on our channel this week.

581
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:16,240
Speaker 1: So if you miss that panel and you don't want to watch it in the middle of like a nine-hour video of That theater from the day our panel happened to be I have a director's cut that actually Has a little more content and is edited a little bit differently and uses our overlays and our camera angles instead of the PAX Overlay and the PAX camera angle, so that'll be up this week.

582
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:18,654
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do the same thing for our other panel.

583
00:43:18,694 --> 00:43:27,672
Speaker 0: if you are a chance If you're looking for a convention atmosphere and there's no conventions to go to you should come to The official geek night's discord.

584
00:43:27,853 --> 00:43:28,940
Speaker 0: you can find links to it.

585
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,880
Speaker 1: I guess if you come to our website if I could come or our forum I'm gonna make an invite link right now while we're doing the main bit and I'll post it in the chat of the live stream.

586
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,818
Speaker 1: Okay, it'll last like 48 hours sure.

587
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:46,020
Speaker 0: But yeah, you should Go to our YouTube stream.

588
00:43:46,140 --> 00:44:03,049
Speaker 0: We stream all geek nights episodes live and there's probably some things that you will hear there that will like a few sentences Maybe that are edited out of the actual mp3 that's loaded to Whatever service we're on every single podcasting service even the new shitty ones like Amazon Google's buy everything.

589
00:44:03,149 --> 00:44:03,590
Speaker 0: We're everywhere.

590
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:06,849
Speaker 1: Also, I read your raccoon wounds.

591
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,880
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, I've been biking to nowhere.

592
00:44:10,302 --> 00:44:20,774
Speaker 0: I just finished a six-week bike to nowhere program in the bike to nowhere app And when I bike to nowhere I turn on the twitch stream because then I can talk to someone while I'm biking to nowhere.

593
00:44:20,815 --> 00:44:23,962
Speaker 0: it makes it much less sad.

594
00:44:24,535 --> 00:44:30,179
Speaker 1: also Playing a lot of Star Wars squadrons that if you're also playing that I'd be happy to suit up and fly with you.

595
00:44:31,104 --> 00:44:33,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you want to come and talk to us you can come to our discord.

596
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:37,632
Speaker 0: You can come to my bike twitch stream.

597
00:44:37,672 --> 00:44:39,799
Speaker 0: you can come, you know, we're every every single place.

598
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,240
Speaker 0: We're there.

599
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,065
Speaker 0: You're listening to this.

600
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:41,648
Speaker 0: You already know.

601
00:44:41,668 --> 00:44:43,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, you already know where we are, right?

602
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:45,867
Speaker 0: So come on down.

603
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:49,225
Speaker 1: All right, let's just get right into it Breaking stuff.

604
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:53,142
Speaker 1: We never really talked about this except tangentially talking about other things Like.

605
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:54,752
Speaker 1: I think we even mentioned it recently.

606
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,503
Speaker 1: we did that show on firmware stuff I'd wear.

607
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:57,228
Speaker 0: I just talked about that.

608
00:44:57,268 --> 00:44:59,021
Speaker 0: that guy got a Ferrari's got exactly I.

609
00:44:59,704 --> 00:45:01,291
Speaker 1: but I think it's actually worth talking about.

610
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,159
Speaker 1: like really what this means.

611
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:12,506
Speaker 1: Because there's a lot of issues around the concept of bricking and some of them edge into society issues some of them edge into capitalism issues some of them edge into.

612
00:45:12,948 --> 00:45:19,308
Speaker 1: these are things you just need to know if you're gonna mess with your own technology like by so Mm-hmm.

613
00:45:19,328 --> 00:45:27,968
Speaker 0: So I mean as a popular Undwell, and I'm sure there's probably some example of bricking that's way older than you Imagine right even though I can't think of it.

614
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:33,687
Speaker 0: but bricking is like a relatively new Phenomenon in like the greater.

615
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:43,121
Speaker 1: I don't know world it did rose Yeah, partly with the what once we went away from using just raw circuits Like.

616
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:47,300
Speaker 1: I'm trying not to use a bunch of electronics jargon here because I don't think all of you are super up on that.

617
00:45:47,360 --> 00:46:07,613
Speaker 1: But there was an error where to use analog circuits and analog logic like logic gates like put a bunch of and or nan gates together on a breadboard along with a bunch of relays and mechanical devices and you would implement the logic of your thing like a furnace in Quote-unquote code but the code was this collection of wires.

618
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:10,000
Speaker 0: So yep, you can like a pinball machine.

619
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's nothing like if you want to update it move the wires around.

620
00:46:14,094 --> 00:46:15,880
Speaker 1: if the wires break replace them.

621
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:17,239
Speaker 1: You can look at the wires.

622
00:46:18,561 --> 00:46:21,780
Speaker 0: There have always been cases of things being broken, right?

623
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,600
Speaker 0: Broken things go way back.

624
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,119
Speaker 0: In fact now things are probably less broken than they've ever been.

625
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:30,533
Speaker 0: Yeah things you used to need a lot more like TV repairmen.

626
00:46:30,573 --> 00:46:32,420
Speaker 0: and so when's the last time you heard of a TV or impairment?

627
00:46:33,821 --> 00:46:42,660
Speaker 1: Part of that is our disposable culture of if a TV breaks is cheaper to throw it away and buy a new one than it Is time it is and even look at it, of course, that is true as well.

628
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,500
Speaker 0: But the point is things just break less often, right?

629
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,000
Speaker 0: It's also it is that but it's also TVs used to break a lot and you'd need to get them repaired.

630
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:52,886
Speaker 0: when's the last time you had a broken TV?

631
00:46:52,987 --> 00:46:56,478
Speaker 1: and also things have gotten cheaper and are more accessible to people.

632
00:46:56,779 --> 00:47:01,959
Speaker 1: and The part that a lot of older people like to forget especially people who complain about the durability of modern things.

633
00:47:02,742 --> 00:47:04,728
Speaker 1: Modern things do a lot more like.

634
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:08,280
Speaker 1: then old things did old furnaces old thermostats.

635
00:47:08,904 --> 00:47:10,699
Speaker 1: There's like one fucking switch in there

636
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:34,560
Speaker 0: Yep But anyway, so the point is is that you know things have always broken right, you know human-made devices of any kind I've always broken but they could then be repaired in some way right because the device in and of itself and Common tools and common materials were all that you required to repair the device and make it work again

637
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:36,959
Speaker 1: In some cases a common knowledge.

638
00:47:37,862 --> 00:47:55,279
Speaker 0: Yes today we have many devices out there and those devices include general-purpose CPUs right and not a general-purpose CPU like that's a very powerful one like the one in your desktop computer But you know like a very small 8-bit chip, you know something that's like you'd find it any s you can

639
00:47:55,299 --> 00:48:00,605
Speaker 1: go CPU that runs it like a Few kilohertz and just does

640
00:48:00,866 --> 00:48:09,395
Speaker 0: some sort of Motorola something something or Texas Instruments some chip or whatever that can run Tiny programs, you know, we're talking like, you know similar.

641
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:10,540
Speaker 0: It's like your Arduino, right?

642
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,920
Speaker 0: It's something it won't be that exact architecture.

643
00:48:13,081 --> 00:48:21,289
Speaker 0: But there's a lot a lot of micro processors in the world that you can buy if you're making products Right and just about every product has micro processors in them.

644
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:28,705
Speaker 0: Your car has probably arm CPUs in it right somewhere running different systems and Those systems have software.

645
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:40,185
Speaker 0: and if you have a desktop computer or even a phone then you have consumer tools That allow you into some level to some degree Modify that software.

646
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:42,213
Speaker 0: you can reinstall your OS on your computer.

647
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:44,422
Speaker 0: Even if you don't know how it can be done Yeah, any.

648
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:48,060
Speaker 0: so you can call someone to do it right and the software is available.

649
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:51,059
Speaker 0: You can get another computer and download that software, right?

650
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:54,871
Speaker 0: If you're I don't know, what's something else that has software?

651
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:56,357
Speaker 0: you're well, I can't know.

652
00:48:56,537 --> 00:49:02,240
Speaker 1: a TV Has software like you can download an app onto it or like hit the factory reset button.

653
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:07,640
Speaker 0: Right, but a lot of devices out there that aren't just personal computers.

654
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:10,088
Speaker 0: Alright, say your refrigerator.

655
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:11,855
Speaker 0: Your refrigerator has software.

656
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:13,040
Speaker 0: It has CPUs in it.

657
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,380
Speaker 0: Probably right if it's a fancy wine doesn't but it is not fancy.

658
00:49:17,164 --> 00:49:20,160
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying there are fridges out there that do have CPUs, right?

659
00:49:21,204 --> 00:49:25,090
Speaker 0: You know, maybe a better example HVAC are really good examples.

660
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:26,580
Speaker 0: No, that's a good one.

661
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,256
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's plenty of just devices you buy that have CPUs in them.

662
00:49:30,276 --> 00:49:31,160
Speaker 0: They are computers.

663
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:40,189
Speaker 0: They're computers inside and those computers are required for the device to function properly Sometimes required for it to function at all, right.

664
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:43,920
Speaker 0: or for the advanced features of the device to function.

665
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:48,279
Speaker 0: It might just work really stupidly if you don't have the computer parts working, right?

666
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,811
Speaker 0: So you don't have access to that software at all.

667
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:55,160
Speaker 0: There's not like they give you a copy of the software.

668
00:49:56,101 --> 00:49:58,297
Speaker 0: There's no interface on the device.

669
00:49:58,357 --> 00:50:00,847
Speaker 0: That is Customer accessible.

670
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:04,400
Speaker 0: right for you to replace the software even if you did have the software.

671
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,391
Speaker 0: It's not like there's an SD card slot and like a load from.

672
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:21,133
Speaker 1: I was about to use an example Metaphor that I realized is actually too old for our audience probably around the the extra buttons ABCD on a phone that a consumer phone does not have.

673
00:50:21,454 --> 00:50:28,600
Speaker 1: but a telephone like a Telephone operations person a repair person has those extra buttons to do extra things on the phone network.

674
00:50:29,043 --> 00:50:31,480
Speaker 1: But I don't think anyone knows about that anymore.

675
00:50:32,316 --> 00:50:56,559
Speaker 0: Yeah People who work who produce electronics or make embedded computers or embedded devices There are certain computer interfaces that they use things like j-tag which like these debug interfaces Like if you're developing a circuit board You'll usually put like a j-tag connector on it and you'll connect your debug device, you know things to that and That way you can develop the circuit board.

676
00:50:56,881 --> 00:50:58,586
Speaker 0: But then when you go into mass production.

677
00:50:58,947 --> 00:51:06,760
Speaker 0: you either don't include that so there's no way to access those pins or You don't put the connector on or it's just hidden inside the vice.

678
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:08,626
Speaker 0: You don't know it's there as a customer.

679
00:51:08,646 --> 00:51:14,106
Speaker 0: and even if you did know it's there as a customer and you found it and connected To it and were an expert.

680
00:51:14,467 --> 00:51:18,322
Speaker 0: you don't have documentation for it necessarily and you know It'll it's not.

681
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:24,240
Speaker 0: it'll be very very difficult for you to actually, you know get any use out of you know the device.

682
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:25,815
Speaker 0: So if anything at

683
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:26,280
Speaker 1: all

684
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:52,540
Speaker 0: happens to the software in the device if the place the software is stored is broken if the software becomes corrupt if You're doing a firmware update through an official channel and it somehow stops halfway through it doesn't finish or it doesn't work properly If you know literally anything happens to that software You now have no way to repair that software because you don't have the bits Even if the hardware is in perfect condition.

685
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:55,351
Speaker 0: Condition hardware, there's.

686
00:51:55,432 --> 00:52:06,440
Speaker 1: it's almost like it's a black box Like literally there is a black box that you cannot interact with in the device And if the failure is inside of that black box, there is no way for you to open that box, right?

687
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,760
Speaker 0: It's like it's theoretically possible for you to fix it, right?

688
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,339
Speaker 0: It's not inhumanly possible.

689
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:17,240
Speaker 0: But you do not have the information or the tools or the knowledge or whatever to actually do it.

690
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:21,440
Speaker 0: The only people who could do it would be easily would be the people who made the device.

691
00:52:21,784 --> 00:52:27,841
Speaker 0: They would be able to access You know and flash into a firmware on it and you could send it back to them to have them fix it or something Right.

692
00:52:28,162 --> 00:52:30,008
Speaker 1: cars are a perfect example here.

693
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:32,417
Speaker 1: modern cars have chips in them that do a bunch of stuff.

694
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:33,340
Speaker 1: old cars.

695
00:52:33,642 --> 00:52:36,079
Speaker 1: There was analog logic and mechanical logic there.

696
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:42,300
Speaker 1: So even if you didn't have specialized tools, you could physically mess with that logic if you had the knowledge.

697
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:51,957
Speaker 1: But even if you have the knowledge you're not connecting to your car's computer unless you're an ultra nerd and A lot of the software you can download from the internet that does that's full of malware.

698
00:52:51,978 --> 00:52:52,480
Speaker 1: So watch out.

699
00:52:53,160 --> 00:53:00,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, some people do figure out some of these interfaces especially on more popular devices and create tools or publish.

700
00:53:00,562 --> 00:53:04,339
Speaker 0: You know black market or gray market ish or free ish.

701
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:12,360
Speaker 0: You know somewhat trustworthy tools that can allow you to help fix or modify the software on devices sort of like how routers.

702
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:13,913
Speaker 0: You can flash your own firmware on them.

703
00:53:13,954 --> 00:53:19,175
Speaker 0: But those are almost general-purpose real PCs with network cards and everything right.

704
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:22,928
Speaker 0: they have an interface that is That you can understand right?

705
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:24,254
Speaker 0: Sometimes they have SD cards.

706
00:53:24,656 --> 00:53:35,896
Speaker 1: So luckily breaking like a device rarely gets bricked unless the user has taken some action or The device had an underlying fundamental problem.

707
00:53:35,936 --> 00:53:41,300
Speaker 0: Like for example You might have us sometimes sometimes there's bad luck, but it's just rare, right?

708
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,967
Speaker 0: It's like oh the the.

709
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:44,754
Speaker 0: there is a some flash memory chip.

710
00:53:45,035 --> 00:53:46,200
Speaker 0: That's like 16 megabytes.

711
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:51,160
Speaker 0: It has the OS on it and it got messed up and it's okay, right?

712
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:52,665
Speaker 0: It's still working.

713
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:55,597
Speaker 0: But because if it was actually broken, well, that would be broken.

714
00:53:55,637 --> 00:53:56,340
Speaker 0: broken, right?

715
00:53:56,881 --> 00:54:01,239
Speaker 0: But even if you replace that part, well, you don't you don't have the software to flash into it, right?

716
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:10,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't happen too often Like if my phone's like battery or like control like charging circuit broke and I just couldn't use it anymore I wouldn't say my phone was bricked.

717
00:54:10,253 --> 00:54:19,411
Speaker 1: I'd say my phone broke Exactly, but if I was doing a firmware update on my phone and the phone just like crashed and then power button didn't do anything Anymore, that's a brick device.

718
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:22,102
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with that hardware Exactly.

719
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:24,269
Speaker 0: Somebody could repair it if they could flash it.

720
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:27,500
Speaker 1: so I would wager and I'm curious if you disagree.

721
00:54:27,821 --> 00:54:31,015
Speaker 1: I think there are three things that cause the majority of all brickings.

722
00:54:31,357 --> 00:54:37,696
Speaker 1: number one Power interruption during an update on a device that did not have proper protections built in.

723
00:54:37,836 --> 00:54:39,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's pretty common.

724
00:54:39,562 --> 00:54:40,847
Speaker 0: Number two, that's the cause.

725
00:54:40,888 --> 00:54:43,700
Speaker 0: that's the cause of a lot of other problems as well like losing save files.

726
00:54:43,841 --> 00:54:47,820
Speaker 0: I think maybe like lots and lots of data corruption is because of that exact problem.

727
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,626
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's trivially solved.

728
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:51,333
Speaker 1: if you just make the device is more expensive.

729
00:54:51,373 --> 00:54:53,320
Speaker 1: people just aren't willing to for a lot of reasons.

730
00:54:53,742 --> 00:54:54,666
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's solved.

731
00:54:54,706 --> 00:55:03,578
Speaker 0: actually Apple has a pretty good a lot and not only Apple But a lot of companies do this where the device will just refuse to do a firmware update if it's not plugged in.

732
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:07,030
Speaker 1: Yep My phone won't do it.

733
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,720
Speaker 0: You can't firmware update your Apple watch unless it's on the charger.

734
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:15,722
Speaker 1: Yeah, my phone will say something like it has to either be on the charger or the battery has to be above 90%.

735
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:18,386
Speaker 0: Yeah, the my gh5 Camera won't.

736
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:23,658
Speaker 0: if you put an SD card in with a firmware update It won't install it unless the battery is over like 90% or something.

737
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,321
Speaker 0: The other

738
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:40,595
Speaker 1: thing to do that's common on more expensive devices is you have a second safe copy of the firmware embedded in the device in Non-rewritable memory that Can automatically bootstrap the system and replace whatever is in the broken memory, but that

739
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:47,305
Speaker 0: that's always a good fallback You know, it's like oh, yeah, it adds to cost but it is very nice when it's like, okay My device is totally messed up.

740
00:55:47,607 --> 00:55:50,880
Speaker 0: I think the pebble watch I want to say had this it had something like that.

741
00:55:51,321 --> 00:56:00,356
Speaker 0: It had something cuz I remember I messed it up once and I held some buttons and did a thing and it was restored To the way it was when I got it in the mail and I had to re-update it.

742
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,420
Speaker 0: That's what I remember.

743
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,166
Speaker 0: I don't know that memory is.

744
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:10,820
Speaker 1: I have a similar memory where I had to do way more like there was a reset and then There was like a no do this thing tough fully fucking reset it.

745
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,980
Speaker 0: You'll see this lot where it says like factory reset.

746
00:56:13,221 --> 00:56:17,685
Speaker 0: Usually you can't do that if you're bricked because you have to access a menu A lot of times.

747
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:21,620
Speaker 0: factory reset just means reset all the settings back to the factory settings.

748
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:35,336
Speaker 0: Yeah sometimes devices do have a true factory reset whereby Pushing certain buttons and a hole in a certain configuration that you would never hit by accident Actually does load a known good firmware from way back and then you can try to update it.

749
00:56:35,377 --> 00:56:37,619
Speaker 0: Yeah number two That's always nice to have.

750
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:38,221
Speaker 1: Yeah I think.

751
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:38,722
Speaker 1: number two.

752
00:56:38,883 --> 00:56:44,839
Speaker 1: the second most common reason is hacker was fucking around with their software or their hardware and they broke it.

753
00:56:45,662 --> 00:56:52,588
Speaker 0: This is the one I call people out on all the time because it's listen if you want to mess with your stuff Um, that's cool, right?

754
00:56:52,628 --> 00:56:54,559
Speaker 0: It's like that's all it's all about but eyes open.

755
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:55,283
Speaker 1: man Like do it?

756
00:56:55,343 --> 00:56:57,595
Speaker 0: eyes you want to run you want to run doom on your calculator?

757
00:56:57,635 --> 00:56:58,420
Speaker 0: That's sweet, right?

758
00:56:58,742 --> 00:57:07,024
Speaker 0: The only time I Wag my finger is when I see people and I see there's a lot which really shocks me like I would understand.

759
00:57:07,064 --> 00:57:15,613
Speaker 0: like if someone says man, I was having fun it trying to get doomed to run on my Toaster and I messed up and now my toaster won't toast.

760
00:57:16,536 --> 00:57:17,579
Speaker 0: I really messed up guys.

761
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:18,000
Speaker 0: This sucks.

762
00:57:18,161 --> 00:57:21,440
Speaker 0: I need to buy a new toaster now, but it's like alright that makes sense.

763
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,411
Speaker 0: If someone says fuck this toaster company, right?

764
00:57:24,672 --> 00:57:25,154
Speaker 0: I messed it.

765
00:57:25,535 --> 00:57:26,840
Speaker 0: Why was it possible for me to mess?

766
00:57:26,941 --> 00:57:27,709
Speaker 0: It's like you messed up.

767
00:57:27,749 --> 00:57:28,577
Speaker 0: You told you did it.

768
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:30,363
Speaker 0: It's your fault.

769
00:57:30,383 --> 00:57:36,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I've messed like I messed with the firmware on my old camera My gx1 because that camera is ancient.

770
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:42,491
Speaker 1: Like if I ruined it somehow not the end of the world Mm-hmm, of course, I didn't mess with.

771
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:43,155
Speaker 1: so my advice.

772
00:57:43,195 --> 00:57:43,980
Speaker 1: what I want to do with it?

773
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,124
Speaker 1: There's no firmware on earth.

774
00:57:45,144 --> 00:57:45,866
Speaker 1: That'll make it do it.

775
00:57:45,987 --> 00:57:46,709
Speaker 0: But right.

776
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:58,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, my advice though is just don't mess with a Device Software in an unofficial capacity, right unless you know what you're doing or willing for that device to be bricked.

777
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's okay with that's.

778
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:00,654
Speaker 1: the second part is important.

779
00:58:00,694 --> 00:58:08,745
Speaker 1: as long as you Accept the risk that it might never work again, and there's nothing you can do about that Yeah, then it's totally cool.

780
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:09,347
Speaker 0: Just go for it.

781
00:58:09,608 --> 00:58:11,475
Speaker 1: I bought that feel like I bought that ps1.

782
00:58:11,616 --> 00:58:13,525
Speaker 1: I Opened it.

783
00:58:13,645 --> 00:58:15,355
Speaker 1: I put I soldered a mod chip into it.

784
00:58:15,657 --> 00:58:17,807
Speaker 1: There was a chance I was gonna ruin that ps1 forever.

785
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:21,120
Speaker 1: if I tried to return that ps1 would not have flown.

786
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,608
Speaker 1: Because what'd you do?

787
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:23,960
Speaker 0: You're crying might have gotten away with it.

788
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,837
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I would add to lie and like I don't know I open the box.

789
00:58:26,877 --> 00:58:27,280
Speaker 1: It didn't work.

790
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:27,823
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

791
00:58:27,843 --> 00:58:29,010
Speaker 0: you that's the thing you would do.

792
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,438
Speaker 1: that is exactly what I would have done.

793
00:58:31,144 --> 00:58:41,076
Speaker 1: I'll go right back to that Kmart and been like hey This ps1 didn't work and hope that by the time a human cracked it open and saw my bungled soldering attempt It was too late to track me down.

794
00:58:42,002 --> 00:58:50,013
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, but there is a new OS to this one though because sometimes That bricking is because you're doing something that you shouldn't have done.

795
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:52,220
Speaker 1: that was dangerous and it broke the device.

796
00:58:52,501 --> 00:58:57,560
Speaker 1: You cannot expect the company that made that device to protect you from your own tomfoolery, right?

797
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,846
Speaker 1: but but Nintendo will do things to like.

798
00:59:02,086 --> 00:59:10,699
Speaker 1: companies like Nintendo have a history of Trying to detect if you're running alternate firmware and brick you on purpose as a fuck you.

799
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,764
Speaker 0: Yes, that's bullshit.

800
00:59:13,346 --> 00:59:18,080
Speaker 1: I it's a similar situation, but I do do not believe that company should have the right.

801
00:59:18,442 --> 00:59:23,848
Speaker 1: I think if you own hardware you could you can do whatever you want with it But it should be a two-way street in return.

802
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:28,362
Speaker 1: that company does not have to support you in any way Exactly.

803
00:59:28,543 --> 00:59:29,286
Speaker 0: It's it's pretty simple.

804
00:59:29,347 --> 00:59:32,100
Speaker 0: That's with you know, I think we have done an episode on right to repair.

805
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is a which is actually a recurring topic that's come back a little bit recently.

806
00:59:36,641 --> 00:59:40,020
Speaker 0: I think this is Massachusetts doing something right to repair.

807
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:44,035
Speaker 1: I feel like Massachusetts has been doing something a right to repair my entire adult life.

808
00:59:44,056 --> 00:59:47,451
Speaker 0: I Think it might be on their voting this thing.

809
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:49,259
Speaker 1: I feel like that's happened before though.

810
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,951
Speaker 0: Massachusetts right to repair something something.

811
00:59:53,152 --> 00:59:57,528
Speaker 0: I can't believe I spelled Massachusetts, right, Massachusetts It's question one on their voting this year.

812
00:59:57,568 --> 01:00:00,798
Speaker 0: right to repair law vehicle data access requirement initiative.

813
01:00:00,859 --> 01:00:01,039
Speaker 0: Fuck.

814
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:11,447
Speaker 0: Yeah So we do research to figure out if yes or no is the right way to vote on question one, Massachusetts I'm not sure because I haven't read it But you obviously want to.

815
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:14,620
Speaker 0: you obviously want to vote in favor of the right to repair.

816
01:00:14,821 --> 01:00:27,500
Speaker 1: I see some text of it and the text of the law says starting with model year 2022 the law would require Manufacturers of motor vehicles sold in the state to equip such vehicles that use any blah blah blah blah blah systems with access.

817
01:00:28,263 --> 01:00:30,049
Speaker 0: So you want to make that law happen.

818
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:32,900
Speaker 0: I assume voting yes is correct, but double-check read the whole thing.

819
01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:34,020
Speaker 1: We don't live in Massachusetts.

820
01:00:35,782 --> 01:00:39,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, I literally favor of the Springfield porno bill.

821
01:00:42,942 --> 01:00:44,929
Speaker 0: Make sure you vote in favor of repairing right?

822
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:46,976
Speaker 0: So but that's the thing is companies.

823
01:00:47,136 --> 01:00:51,860
Speaker 0: Apple right is Loosened up on this as they've been criticized, but they still have problems.

824
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,886
Speaker 0: John Deere is obviously always the number one Culprit that's.

825
01:00:54,947 --> 01:01:06,694
Speaker 0: cars are a big one but cars are huge but in which basically the scam is that people make a device and because of the Possibility of bricking right and the secretness of the software.

826
01:01:06,935 --> 01:01:08,099
Speaker 0: They're the only ones who have it.

827
01:01:09,384 --> 01:01:18,119
Speaker 0: They can basically hold you hostage and force you to use their repair Services and not use any other repair services even when there's no reason for that, right?

828
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:31,900
Speaker 1: You know, there might be some legitimate reasons for you to only use certain repair service or there might be Some changes you could make to that software that are or should be illegal because cars use public infrastructure.

829
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,344
Speaker 0: that's true also.

830
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:37,055
Speaker 0: or there are changes you could make to that.

831
01:01:37,095 --> 01:01:38,158
Speaker 0: so that hardware.

832
01:01:38,459 --> 01:01:42,397
Speaker 0: that would Damage the business model of the person selling the hardware.

833
01:01:42,457 --> 01:01:44,806
Speaker 1: I don't care Business model dude.

834
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,754
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could just load any old games.

835
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:48,140
Speaker 0: I want on my Nintendo switch.

836
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,766
Speaker 0: It's now a play everything machine.

837
01:01:49,826 --> 01:01:53,900
Speaker 0: It's got it, you know, every emulator known to man, but simultaneously you sold me hardware.

838
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,429
Speaker 1: I'm running software on that hardware.

839
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:56,435
Speaker 1: You don't get to say what I do.

840
01:01:56,455 --> 01:02:05,090
Speaker 1: I think They're like car right to repair like any mechanic should be able to interface with any cars.

841
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:16,534
Speaker 1: electronics full stop, but There are definitely some things that an individual might do like making their car more performant but remove like reducing the emissions protections.

842
01:02:16,855 --> 01:02:22,039
Speaker 1: that should be illegal and We got to figure out the line there which might come down to.

843
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:32,272
Speaker 1: When your car gets inspected and it's determined that you've turned off the emission control your car gets taken from you because you are Violating the contract of society independent.

844
01:02:32,312 --> 01:02:37,919
Speaker 0: That's that's a separate problem is I think, you know Just the penalties for car infractions are way too low.

845
01:02:38,909 --> 01:02:51,320
Speaker 1: Yep So general, I think not enforced Well, but anyway I think the number three thing that causes brickings is the one that I am the most mad about But I think it's a distant third for now, but I think it's gonna get worse and worse.

846
01:02:52,203 --> 01:02:56,507
Speaker 1: Company has sold a device hardware like a speaker or something.

847
01:02:57,169 --> 01:03:06,958
Speaker 1: company then wants to monetize said hardware in perpetuity and Forces like bricks the hardware if the licensing is not paid to continue using the software.

848
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,310
Speaker 0: Oh That's similar to the right.

849
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:10,860
Speaker 0: Well, I guess that would be the fourth one, right?

850
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:12,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, is it?

851
01:03:12,244 --> 01:03:20,529
Speaker 0: it's still some sort of DRM thing, right it's it's similar but yeah where the company basically There's a device that they sell a washing machine, right?

852
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:30,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is no once that washing machine is in place You know as long as you know for getting right to repair right assuming it works There's.

853
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:32,497
Speaker 0: you don't need the company that sold it to you anymore.

854
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:32,920
Speaker 0: I don't want to.

855
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,706
Speaker 1: I don't even need to write.

856
01:03:34,786 --> 01:03:37,355
Speaker 0: I just wanted to keep doing what you you you pay them.

857
01:03:37,475 --> 01:03:41,848
Speaker 0: once you don't have a washing machine It works it's gonna work forever until it breaks.

858
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:50,468
Speaker 0: by putting software in that washing machine they can artificially force Basically rent-seeking where it's like.

859
01:03:50,488 --> 01:03:54,004
Speaker 0: well because we put software in the washing machine We can make your.

860
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:57,658
Speaker 0: it's like holding you hostage almost or blackmailing or extorting like.

861
01:03:57,778 --> 01:04:01,439
Speaker 1: well It might be like you have to let us collect data about you or we brick you.

862
01:04:02,323 --> 01:04:17,580
Speaker 0: right, it's like you have made you a washing machine, but we have software in there and Basically if you don't you know do what we say from now on and use your washing machine the way we want you to and Maybe buy a subscription service from us or who knows what right right?

863
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,672
Speaker 0: We're gonna keep controlling you even though our transaction is complete right.

864
01:04:22,193 --> 01:04:24,520
Speaker 0: Oh, I see you've bought a music listening device.

865
01:04:24,641 --> 01:04:31,129
Speaker 0: There's no reason that it couldn't just play music forever until it breaks But you know oh you want to.

866
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:34,480
Speaker 0: uh you want to use a battery from another third party, right?

867
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,026
Speaker 0: We don't want to buy batteries from us.

868
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:40,927
Speaker 0: Oh you want to you know listen to music from a company We don't like you know.

869
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:41,651
Speaker 0: Oh you want.

870
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:42,415
Speaker 0: You know it's like all right.

871
01:04:42,435 --> 01:04:43,360
Speaker 0: We're gonna shut you down.

872
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,339
Speaker 0: We're gonna force you to you know stay with us.

873
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:49,531
Speaker 0: We're gonna sort of keep a stranglehold on you because you bought our product.

874
01:04:49,611 --> 01:04:51,980
Speaker 0: obviously don't buy those products that are doing that.

875
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:55,265
Speaker 1: But also there should be a buy.

876
01:04:55,306 --> 01:05:01,744
Speaker 1: you need some sort of rights of access and use like Those business models.

877
01:05:02,146 --> 01:05:05,978
Speaker 0: those business rent-seeking business models like that should just be outlawed straight up.

878
01:05:06,499 --> 01:05:07,658
Speaker 1: Yep You should be able to do it.

879
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,148
Speaker 1: Well, actually we just need a very simple consumer protection.

880
01:05:10,188 --> 01:05:35,644
Speaker 1: that if you sell hardware and obviously this is not the legal definition This is the colloquial definition if you sell a hardware it must come with the minimum necessary software to operate that hardware if software is necessary and You have a right in perpetuity to use that software or to write build or derive Equivalent software in the event that that software becomes unusable something like that

881
01:05:36,507 --> 01:05:44,399
Speaker 0: and this and the company that makes the device is not allowed to You know remotely disable or hinder the device in any

882
01:05:44,419 --> 01:05:44,640
Speaker 1: way.

883
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:52,140
Speaker 1: They might not let you use their app and all like all their fancy stuff But they have to let you do what the hardware did with that minimum software right exactly?

884
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,480
Speaker 0: So if you're offering for example the GoPro right there's a GoPro app you can get on your phone.

885
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they they.

886
01:05:57,827 --> 01:06:00,280
Speaker 0: but they make you get a stupid GoPro account, right?

887
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:05,300
Speaker 0: You don't actually need the account but the account gives you access to like this cloud service, which is garbage.

888
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,204
Speaker 0: You don't need that either.

889
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:07,952
Speaker 0: but it's like okay the cloud service.

890
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:09,620
Speaker 0: You're selling me some extra thing.

891
01:06:09,701 --> 01:06:12,160
Speaker 0: I get you right, but you can get the firmware updates without paying.

892
01:06:13,463 --> 01:06:15,338
Speaker 0: But imagine if they were like, alright, you know what?

893
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,620
Speaker 0: Your GoPro isn't gonna even record videos anymore.

894
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:22,751
Speaker 0: Right unless you join our pay for our cloud.

895
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:25,059
Speaker 1: You gotta pay five bucks to use the HDMI out.

896
01:06:25,964 --> 01:06:28,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like that would be some bullshit, right?

897
01:06:29,581 --> 01:06:31,479
Speaker 0: basically This is bullshit.
