9
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:43,337
Speaker 0: You've been very unexcited about pretty much everything lately.

10
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:43,840
Speaker 0: Are you dying?

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,024

Speaker 0: stuff's nice.

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,905
Speaker 0: I'm doing that all right You're not excited about it.

17
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:53,211
Speaker 1: What is there to say?

18
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,160
Speaker 0: is there anything you're excited about in the entire world?

19
00:00:58,446 --> 00:00:59,939
Speaker 1: All right, the weather's still good.

20
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,625
Speaker 1: It's gonna sell it for a while.

21
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:08,813
Speaker 0: Tycho tweeted the other day, and he was like basically it appears that he encountered fascination for the first time.

22
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:12,186
Speaker 0: hmm and fascination is the thing that's not widely known.

23
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:26,260
Speaker 0: it was very popular in like the 50s like the late 50s early 60s and By the 70s it was basically gone from all the places that it existed Except cedar point which had one of the first rigs, and it was like a big deal there.

24
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:35,878
Speaker 0: It was there at cedar point from 1955 until like the 2000s when they finally got rid of it because no one cares about What is actually kind of a shitty game?

25
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:38,679
Speaker 1: We could just make a fascination if you really wanted one.

26
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:39,521
Speaker 0: Yeah But you could.

27
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:44,199
Speaker 1: as long as someone maintains the memory of how the game is played anyone can make one if they ever wanted to.

28
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,857
Speaker 1: Yep actually That would be a good thing for someone to make a digital version of on phones that everyone like.

29
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:55,300
Speaker 0: it's like oh Yeah, when everyone just fascinates and in fact you want to make it a little engaging like you have to flick the balls up.

30
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:58,584
Speaker 0: So it's all like that kind of obviously Game to begin with.

31
00:01:58,885 --> 00:01:59,848
Speaker 0: yeah, even though it isn't.

32
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,414
Speaker 0: it's just a random game that you can.

33
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:07,260
Speaker 1: obviously we'd put lots of randomness into the Engine after you play your dexterity bit basically multiplayer Angry Birds.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,503
Speaker 0: But so this game you know he tweeted about it, and I just remembered that it existed and It can't.

35
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:20,627
Speaker 0: this is like the second time it had disappeared from my life, and then out of nowhere I bump into it somewhere.

36
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:21,874
Speaker 1: I didn't wild where they had it.

37
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:22,256
Speaker 0: Yeah.

38
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:23,100
Speaker 0: I was some years ago.

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,170
Speaker 0: We go to wildwood one year, and I'm like what fascination.

40
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,256
Speaker 0: There's no way and we walk in as totally it.

41
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:33,920
Speaker 0: so I Can't vouch for the chain of custody.

42
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:45,422
Speaker 0: But I found a blog that claims That the fat at least some of the fascination set that is in Wildwood was the one they took from cedar point Mmm.

43
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:46,786
Speaker 0: I can't verify that.

44
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:50,517
Speaker 0: I don't know how I could verify the head other than trying to call people.

45
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:55,951
Speaker 0: that could be some investigative journalism, but What I did find is a photo.

46
00:02:56,012 --> 00:03:14,985
Speaker 0: because the building you know if that area of cedar point Was just a really cool area because it was built in the 50s that part The park was already old at that point and they built like this brand new modern pavilion And like this giant convention center and all these buildings and fascination was a part of it, so I found this photo from The 90s.

47
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:17,560
Speaker 0: it looks like and you can see the fascination building there.

48
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:22,290
Speaker 0: And I found this other photo from the 50s and you can see that.

49
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,306
Speaker 0: It's literally Clothing.

50
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:30,559
Speaker 0: the people are wearing Mm-hmm, it's good stuff.

51
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:37,766
Speaker 0: So I could kind of want to go to see the point like real bad that that I saw that photo when I was like Oh, man, and then I spent like 10 minutes.

52
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:40,354
Speaker 0: Just looking at pictures of like the Millennium Force.

53
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:42,060
Speaker 1: So just go I'm thinking about it.

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,346
Speaker 0: I think stop you.

55
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,054
Speaker 0: I gotta find a free weekend.

56
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:46,018
Speaker 0: We had a lot of shit going on.

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,615
Speaker 1: You can just go like tomorrow me back in time for kinetic on.

58
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:52,829
Speaker 0: uh I could except I got shit to do.

59
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,122
Speaker 0: so if I got shit to do for kinetic on don't do that shit Alright.

60
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:59,298
Speaker 0: anyway got any news because there's actually a lot of gaming news.

61
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:01,668
Speaker 1: suddenly It is one ginormous gaming news.

62
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:04,700
Speaker 1: So it's been sort of a half news for a while, right?

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,832
Speaker 1: This is one of those news stories or when it first showed up.

64
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:08,340
Speaker 1: I was like, that's not news.

65
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:10,039
Speaker 1: I read about that like a month ago.

66
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,424
Speaker 1: Yes that the.

67
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:19,500
Speaker 1: the non news is that people are basically gambling on eSports using Things in steam to launder the money, right?

68
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,696
Speaker 1: So I think we explained this and we talked about this when it was news to begin with.

69
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:34,061
Speaker 1: but just to reiterate So you're maybe underage or maybe you're in a you're betting on eSports You're almost definitely under the age of 18 or do not have a credit card or maybe right, you know You.

70
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:38,860
Speaker 1: for some you want to bet on something that you normally not allowed to bet on sports gambling and you want to bet on?

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,523
Speaker 1: eSports like.

72
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:45,860
Speaker 1: I bet rim is gonna win this counter-strike match or I bet Dago's gonna win this Street, so in other words, you're already a moron, right?

73
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,040
Speaker 1: You're already more on betting on this.

74
00:04:47,103 --> 00:05:04,873
Speaker 1: so You go and you can't use real money for this because you get the shut the fuck down in jail and bad stuffs and a That wants to facilitate that obviously can't do it with real money because even the fan duel and you know draft kings Which are enormous had, you know, bajillions of dollars were advertising all over TV.

75
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:07,179
Speaker 1: huge companies got shut down, right?

76
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,859
Speaker 1: Because you can't get away with that.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:19,335
Speaker 1: So what people did is they said all right everyone turn your money into like counter-strike skins will gamble the skins And then you can turn it back into money and it'll be money laundering and it'll totally work.

78
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,081
Speaker 1: and it worked and it still works Today.

79
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,185
Speaker 1: you can do this now.

80
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:23,670
Speaker 0: That is not the whole story.

81
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,456
Speaker 0: That's just like what I think that's.

82
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:26,520
Speaker 1: that's the old news.

83
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:27,022
Speaker 1: That was.

84
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:27,724
Speaker 1: that's been so.

85
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:31,540
Speaker 1: we talked about that a long time ago when it started happening and it's not new.

86
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,444
Speaker 1: Here's the new thing.

87
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:36,180
Speaker 1: So there was a site that was facilitating this sort of gambling.

88
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:43,080
Speaker 1: Okay, this site was being promoted on certain counter-strike streamers YouTube channels.

89
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,384
Speaker 0: Yep, shouting man, right?

90
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:48,717
Speaker 1: So obviously if you're a you know counter-strike streamer, that's the kind of sponsor you're gonna get.

91
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:49,600
Speaker 1: it makes total sense.

92
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:58,380
Speaker 1: Okay Those YouTube streamers were revealed to have been the owners of that site.

93
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,077
Speaker 1: So this is like it's low.

94
00:06:01,097 --> 00:06:01,560
Speaker 0: What did you say?

95
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:10,074
Speaker 0: It's like if I ran three-card Monty and I played against my own Three-card Monty in a YouTube stream and I was winning a ton of money.

96
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:12,783
Speaker 0: because look how fucking great I am at this Isn't it amazing?

97
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:13,284
Speaker 0: Right?

98
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:16,333
Speaker 0: It's basically you should also play this three-card Monty that I don't.

99
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:26,079
Speaker 1: they didn't reveal the fact that they own this Company, they just pretended like they were being sponsored by it and then they were on stream or on YouTube would you know?

100
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,541
Speaker 1: gamble and Win.

101
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:38,260
Speaker 1: so it's like if it's like if I went into the Scott casino and you didn't know that I was Scott and I made A video of myself at the roulette table and he just kept landing on my number and I was raking it in.

102
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,400
Speaker 1: I'm like, wow everyone this Scott casino was just sponsoring me, you know, they're paying me to advertise how great they are.

103
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,117
Speaker 1: But look I came here and I'm totally raking it in like at the roulette table.

104
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:49,960
Speaker 1: Holy shit everyone.

105
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,265
Speaker 1: You got to come down to the Scott casino.

106
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:51,787
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

107
00:06:52,390 --> 00:07:00,620
Speaker 1: You didn't know that it literally not only was You know me owning the casino, but also that roulette table is rigged.

108
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:07,780
Speaker 1: And if you come to the Scott casino You're gonna lose all your money and the whole casino is built on top of a giant money laundering ring, right?

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,192
Speaker 1: So these guys got caught and revealed.

110
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:13,240
Speaker 0: now what's a huge fiasco?

111
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:14,466
Speaker 1: This is one.

112
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:24,000
Speaker 0: it's almost like another step toward Big boy times with eSports because that's the kind of corruption that you get in real things where there's real money.

113
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:27,198
Speaker 0: But they're not real big time yet They're little baby money.

114
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:33,139
Speaker 0: And the reason you know, there's still a little baby money is that this is such a government hasn't?

115
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,724
Speaker 0: first It's such babies.

116
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,834
Speaker 0: first scam like it took what was out of the call.

117
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:38,897
Speaker 0: someone posted a video like.

118
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:39,760
Speaker 0: they figured this out.

119
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:45,459
Speaker 0: It took basically a few minutes of investigative journalism to figure out what was going on.

120
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:49,532
Speaker 0: Like this was not the best and brightest minds and organized crime.

121
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is like a couple steps below Fat Tony.

122
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,587
Speaker 1: Right, but the regulated casinos of the world.

123
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:58,680
Speaker 1: You should take bets on eSports because apparently people want to make those bets.

124
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:04,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the people who want to make those bets are Probably dumb young kids and they only have counter-strike skins to bet.

125
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,018
Speaker 1: they don't have money to bet.

126
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:13,590
Speaker 0: Yep So if you'll take counter-strike skins if I can go to your casino give you a counter-strike skin and get chips and we're gonna talk.

127
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,599
Speaker 1: Also noteworthy that like valve as you know Shut them down to an extent.

128
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:24,700
Speaker 1: But valve is not like done everything within their power that they could do if they wanted to to shut this down.

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:35,515
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is there's no way to 100% shut this kind of thing down just because unless you remove the markets or skins I'm waiting for the shoe to drop and the government to come after.

130
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:46,960
Speaker 1: pretty much everyone Who has sort of a currency like steam has steam money that can be exchanged into real money Like even I'm surprised they'd have it in all these years gone after like Second Life money, which can be turned into real money

131
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,129
Speaker 0: I think the only reason they have not enough money

132
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,840
Speaker 1: or Eve online money, which can be turned into real money, right?

133
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,846
Speaker 1: Eventually, the government is gonna cut.

134
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,800
Speaker 1: our governments of the world will go after these things.

135
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:07,740
Speaker 0: Even if they can't be turned back into real money directly they can still be used for these purposes because they have a value Because there is a market even if that markets entirely within these egos.

136
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,018
Speaker 1: yes, but would you bet a picture of Abraham Lincoln that could get you a bacon egg and cheese sandwich?

137
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,880
Speaker 1: and Even if you won and the winnings were huge you can get a million dollars.

138
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,900
Speaker 1: But those million dollars could only be used to buy pokeballs in Pokemon.

139
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:24,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, you would not make that bet because you'd rather have a union.

140
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:25,920
Speaker 1: five dollars of real money.

141
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,866
Speaker 1: They could be used for anything.

142
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:31,099
Speaker 1: but the problem is more valuable than a bazillion dollars That can only be used for you worthless counter-strike skins.

143
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:34,635
Speaker 0: If you made it the other way like in overwatch their skins, right?

144
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:38,300
Speaker 0: Like there's all this stuff There's no way to trade them with other people.

145
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:39,365
Speaker 0: You can just get.

146
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:42,220
Speaker 1: they do that on purpose because they don't want this kind of shit to have.

147
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a one-way valve.

148
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:44,834
Speaker 0: they come into you and you can't.

149
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:45,880
Speaker 0: they can't ever go away from you.

150
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,900
Speaker 0: You can't like sell your sweet sick skin to someone.

151
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:59,359
Speaker 1: Yep, but like the directness of this scam is almost Insulting quote but cover makes money on this right because they make a cut every time you make a you know.

152
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:01,072
Speaker 1: Yeah, sell some shit on Steam.

153
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,000
Speaker 0: So wasn't even worse.

154
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,545
Speaker 0: They were from what I read.

155
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:10,759
Speaker 0: they were going so far as to make fake videos like straight-up Rigged matches as part of all this.

156
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,480
Speaker 1: Like it goes it's not like you're gonna find the server and spectate it and see and watch the match.

157
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:17,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

158
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:17,946
Speaker 0: It's like.

159
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:20,777
Speaker 0: it's like if I made a betting ring, but it's not even the sting.

160
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:24,837
Speaker 0: remember that world WWF wrestling board game from the late 80s?

161
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:29,395
Speaker 0: No, well, it came with a VHS tape and maybe I do.

162
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:42,800
Speaker 0: occasionally in the game You'd both like get a wrestler like I get Hulk Hogan and you get Andre the Giant and then you'd watch Like a part of the VHS tape and you'd see the match and whichever whichever wrestler won you got points.

163
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:46,699
Speaker 0: It'd be like if I ran a betting ring on that VHS tape.

164
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:53,761
Speaker 1: Oh, if you haven't seen it the movie the sting it's maybe like I Can't.

165
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:57,780
Speaker 1: I can't make a ranking right now, but top 50 movies of all time ever buried me.

166
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,200
Speaker 1: It's a real good man the history of human beings.

167
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,631
Speaker 1: So you have to see that it's a necessary movie for all human beings to watch.

168
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:03,871
Speaker 1: but

169
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:04,634
Speaker 0: watch regardless

170
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:05,697
Speaker 1: of actual rank and

171
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:14,159
Speaker 0: realize that What they what the characters pull off in in that movie is so far beyond the little baby scam that happened here

172
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:22,200
Speaker 1: Yep, and even the sting which when you watch it seems like pro mode is not even real close to real pro mode.

173
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:25,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I guess eSports is starting to come of age.

174
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,980
Speaker 0: But the problem is you're gonna get basically any time like an industry appears like this and gets to a certain level.

175
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:41,279
Speaker 0: There's a lot of obvious dumb scams that you could do to make a lot of money and no one no one bigger than you Or smarter than you is paying attention enough to stop you.

176
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:49,771
Speaker 0: Like if you try to do like baby's first scam in like the drug trade or Any of the things that the real mafias in you'll be dead.

177
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,040
Speaker 0: They'll either kill you or they'll take all your money.

178
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:53,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like and people.

179
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:58,440
Speaker 1: It's like people who know how three-card money works and go to one and start winning.

180
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,932
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what happens when you walk away from the three-card money.

181
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:02,539
Speaker 1: They come and beat you up and take the money back.

182
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,169
Speaker 1: But here like you're not smart.

183
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,731
Speaker 0: there are.

184
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,258
Speaker 0: no one big is watching this.

185
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:13,318
Speaker 0: yet So small fry took out smaller fry you got.

186
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:18,433
Speaker 0: you know There's way more similar level corruption and nonsense going on in this realm.

187
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:19,596
Speaker 0: the moral of all of this?

188
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:20,760
Speaker 0: don't bet on eSports.

189
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:22,687
Speaker 0: It's the dumbest thing you could do don't?

190
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:30,294
Speaker 1: I mean first of all betting at all is dumb because even if you bet in a regulated Non-cheating place like a real legit casino the house always wins.

191
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:36,511
Speaker 0: and you know, even if you ever bought a stock I mean, you know It's just a sliding scale.

192
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:37,778
Speaker 0: I'm just saying just saying.

193
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:39,231
Speaker 0: But no, you're right.

194
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,746
Speaker 0: Don't go to casinos Don't bet money in casinos.

195
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:44,195
Speaker 0: if you're gonna bet money at least bet money that you expect.

196
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:49,020
Speaker 1: if you're going to bet money Bet it in that legit casino and not in some unregulated crazy house.

197
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:52,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz look they can just take your money and I'll give you anything back as they fuck you.

198
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:54,386
Speaker 1: We're not regulated.

199
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:56,195
Speaker 1: We're just you just gave me money for nothing.

200
00:12:56,316 --> 00:13:00,340
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Yeah, at least in the casino they take your money, but then they give you like free food.

201
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:06,529
Speaker 1: If the casino doesn't give you money when you give them the chips back like the cops will come and make them do it Right or they get shut.

202
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,379
Speaker 1: this things will happen.

203
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:16,567
Speaker 1: but if you buy some chips at the you know random you buy some counter jury skins to gamble with and They don't give you money in exchange for skins.

204
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,309
Speaker 1: You're just fucked.

205
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,979
Speaker 1: You're sitting there with a fancy-looking gun and you that's it.

206
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:35,340
Speaker 0: But it's interesting because they did this shadily to make their money and be semi-legal like they advertise the site like it was an open site but Bitcoin exists, they weren't even big enough fry to just do it like directly with bitcoins.

207
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:37,565
Speaker 0: Think about that.

208
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:41,100
Speaker 0: They had to go a step below Bitcoin as their current.

209
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,340
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's because their target audience couldn't get bitcoins.

210
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,754
Speaker 1: their target audience though is kids who have time and don't even have credit cards.

211
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:51,290
Speaker 1: so they can just play counter-strike and Get skins and then bet with them.

212
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,264
Speaker 1: and then literally you see if like you're a kid You have no money.

213
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:58,140
Speaker 1: So you play counter-strike and you win some skins by playing counter-strike.

214
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,333
Speaker 1: You just earn it with time which you have plenty of and then you turn those.

215
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:12,679
Speaker 1: you can turn those skins into a bunch of Money to buy steam games if you gamble and win with them as opposed to Grinding even more and steam games are worth way more to kids that age the kids who have so much free time.

216
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:15,043
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just.

217
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:20,767
Speaker 0: I don't have a lot of sympathy for the people who are betting on this stuff Because how can you how do you not see this coming?

218
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:22,412
Speaker 0: But at the same time?

219
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:28,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I kind of expecting all this to get shut down and Maybe some of these people go to jail like.

220
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,840
Speaker 0: I don't think so because I don't think it's even big enough time.

221
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:37,320
Speaker 1: I don't think there's any DA or anything or federal agent or anyone who's even noticed this thing has happened.

222
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not.

223
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:42,300
Speaker 1: the Justice Department isn't even like this isn't even like a paper in their office.

224
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:50,631
Speaker 0: But in a way it's kind of like the scammers who only target load small drug dealers because the small drug dealer can't call the police On you when they were drug deal.

225
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:52,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of the same thing.

226
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,211
Speaker 0: But they're targeting the same kinds of kids who buy games.

227
00:14:56,512 --> 00:15:00,303
Speaker 0: they trade their games in at the electronics boutique Mm-hmm.

228
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:05,600
Speaker 0: So in other news, there's an article on Kotaku and it was big in the rounds.

229
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:09,780
Speaker 0: I kind of feel like I got to talk about it because it it is such a tag is still around.

230
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's part of my news.

231
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:19,094
Speaker 0: Okay But well actually interestingly when I googled for the thing we just talked about The number one result is a bunch of Kotaku articles.

232
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:19,939
Speaker 0: Not any other side.

233
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:27,619
Speaker 0: Whatever it's a true story, uh The other thing not this thing your thing your thing Kotaku is like the number one source when I googled.

234
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:38,920
Speaker 0: But anyway this thing it's just an op-ed on Kotaku about overwatch, but it was titled overwatch is competitive mode is at odds with the rest of the game.

235
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:44,160
Speaker 0: That's the kind of thing that someone like us might say in a panel and then try to back it up with some evidence.

236
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:46,579
Speaker 0: And I saw a lot of people commenting on this.

237
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:53,299
Speaker 0: But this article is sort of amazing because it's basically Complaining up.

238
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:53,701
Speaker 0: it's like it.

239
00:15:53,762 --> 00:16:00,509
Speaker 0: it's like you complaining about a banana because it's yellow and it tastes good and You could throw the peel on the ground someone might slip on it.

240
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:08,763
Speaker 0: and that's funny like Complaining about the thing for being the thing it is and complaining about the thing for the thing for the thing that the thing is supposed to be The.

241
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:26,124
Speaker 0: so basically the article talks about how overwatch Players have a certain sort of Expectation of the game like you're gonna keep leveling up like you're always progressing That it's not a super serious competition that you can just sort of play for fun that the matchmaking is very individually driven So you can just randomly play with people.

242
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:35,869
Speaker 0: it'll always be fun, and he's mad that because the competitive mode exists People who are serious about the game Look down on.

243
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:38,500
Speaker 0: the non-competitive mode is not being the real game.

244
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,143
Speaker 1: What do you care?

245
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:40,027
Speaker 1: what someone else does?

246
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:42,520
Speaker 1: you don't like the competitive mode don't play it.

247
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,107
Speaker 1: What does it matter whether it exists or not?

248
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:46,780
Speaker 0: mad that the people who are in competitive mode if he plays in it?

249
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,618
Speaker 0: That's not even playing.

250
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,491
Speaker 1: That's like if you're playing in the little league and you're mad.

251
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,020
Speaker 1: the Major League Baseball exists.

252
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:54,893
Speaker 1: It's like you can just not watch it and not pay attention to it.

253
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,300
Speaker 1: Just keep playing a little league game.

254
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:57,736
Speaker 1: What's the problem?

255
00:16:57,837 --> 00:16:58,040
Speaker 0: yep?

256
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:06,593
Speaker 0: But he's also like he gets in a pretty specific detail about like how you level up and level up in the normal game But then in the competitive game you might level down like.

257
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:07,718
Speaker 0: that feels real bad.

258
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:08,179
Speaker 0: don't suck.

259
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,388
Speaker 0: It feels bad to have an elo ranking.

260
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:11,554
Speaker 1: if you suck don't play it.

261
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,119
Speaker 1: then yeah, what's the problem?

262
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,046
Speaker 1: I mean this isn't new.

263
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:15,880
Speaker 1: this is like hundred-year-old news, right?

264
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:22,319
Speaker 1: It's there are people who are gamers who actually want to compete and test their skills against each other and see who is better.

265
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:27,940
Speaker 1: But then there's an ender game And you know you think this is a false dichotomy because it's like you're splitting things right down the middle.

266
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:29,905
Speaker 1: I was like no It's not a false dichotomy at all.

267
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:46,093
Speaker 1: there are two types of gamers the kinds who want to compete and see who's better and the Just like playing a game and want to just enjoy the act of playing it and just want to feel good all the time and Don't care about testing their skills or seeing who's better than anyone else now.

268
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:46,896
Speaker 1: That's fine.

269
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:48,160
Speaker 0: both kinds of gaming.

270
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,680
Speaker 1: You're totally legitimate right, but what's being mad that the other kind of person exists?

271
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:58,759
Speaker 1: It's like every one thing if overwatch is only competitive mode now, but it's not so who the fuck cares?

272
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,248
Speaker 0: yeah But it's interesting.

273
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:10,552
Speaker 0: I've never seen we were talking about this the other day I've never seen an article that was so on the nose of someone basically saying I Really, just want to climb into that Skinner box and never come out right.

274
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,740
Speaker 0: I really just give me that variable reward schedule.

275
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:14,615
Speaker 1: That's the one thing that really gets me right.

276
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,544
Speaker 1: is like you look And it's like you know you.

277
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:20,678
Speaker 1: when you imagine a rat in a Skinner box or a person playing an RPG or you know a?

278
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,212
Speaker 1: Candy crush you think ah there's a person they have.

279
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:24,915
Speaker 1: you know the psych.

280
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,000
Speaker 1: you see the psychology.

281
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:30,568
Speaker 1: They're like ah they are trapped in this loop of you know Reward and right.

282
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,999
Speaker 1: it's like aha I see what has happened to them.

283
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:37,894
Speaker 1: But for the person to be you imagine the rat doesn't realize what's going on.

284
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:40,136
Speaker 1: right the rat is just eating food and doing its thing.

285
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:44,435
Speaker 1: But for the person to know like I know I'm in a Skinner box.

286
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:45,680
Speaker 1: I know how a Skinner box works.

287
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:47,629
Speaker 1: I know everything that's going on here.

288
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:48,774
Speaker 1: There is no mystery here.

289
00:18:49,075 --> 00:18:50,160
Speaker 1: I see behind the curtain.

290
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:56,227
Speaker 0: I like what I see behind the curtain, but I see out the window outside the Skinner box And I'm mad that that exists.

291
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:58,840
Speaker 1: right I am happy to be in the Skinner box.

292
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:00,791
Speaker 1: I don't want this Skinner box to change how it works.

293
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:02,360
Speaker 1: I like what's going on behind that curtain.

294
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:07,840
Speaker 1: I love being in here, but I'm mad that there's a world outside of the Skinner box that has been brought to my attention.

295
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,009
Speaker 0: I mean here's a line from the article.

296
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:09,453
Speaker 0: This is just.

297
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:10,400
Speaker 0: this is exquisite.

298
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:17,597
Speaker 0: So let's say you win a 40-minute match only to find that your skill rating level bar barely budgets.

299
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:20,109
Speaker 0: That's fucking unsatisfying.

300
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:30,819
Speaker 0: partially on Because overwatch previously trained us to a. Expect short matches and be expect big rewards after those short matches.

301
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:32,185
Speaker 1: Look, so don't.

302
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:34,012
Speaker 1: well first of all don't play competitive mode.

303
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:34,293
Speaker 1: second.

304
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,056
Speaker 0: What rewards?

305
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,180
Speaker 0: there's no rewards.

306
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,063
Speaker 0: It's just a game.

307
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:37,966
Speaker 0: you either win or lose.

308
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:39,392
Speaker 0: you don't level up anything.

309
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,215
Speaker 0: a number goes up.

310
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:41,580
Speaker 0: that number means literally nothing.

311
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:42,405
Speaker 1: Oh, it does.

312
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:46,812
Speaker 1: if you're a person who likes numbers going up But like someone who plays candy crush the only

313
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:54,616
Speaker 0: thing the numbers ever meant to me is sometimes I see someone who has a really really high number But then they're not good And I just feel bad for them because I know they played way more than me there.

314
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:56,463
Speaker 1: listen most people Seem to like.

315
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:58,609
Speaker 1: you know, they even it's it does.

316
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:09,940
Speaker 1: the weird part is even though they recognize that this number is just a number They still like it And it's like, you know, I feel like once you recognize what's going on, then it doesn't work.

317
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,325
Speaker 1: It shouldn't work on you anymore.

318
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:12,911
Speaker 0: when you saw through the matrix.

319
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:15,300
Speaker 0: He didn't immediately go and eat a steak, right?

320
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:21,000
Speaker 1: It's like, you know You see the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain and even the fucking dumbass tin man who has no brain.

321
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:21,743
Speaker 1: Here's the woman.

322
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:22,306
Speaker 1: no brain, right?

323
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:24,013
Speaker 1: No, who does do his no brain?

324
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,399
Speaker 1: scarecrow the scarecrow.

325
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:31,440
Speaker 1: And he sees that the Wizard of Oz is not really this magic hologram thing.

326
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,699
Speaker 1: It's just a dude behind the curtain and even him with no brain is like I was a bunch of horseshit.

327
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:43,598
Speaker 1: Hey, but meanwhile, this dude is a scarecrow going behind the curtain and say oh, I see it's a guy behind their curtain But don't take my fucking hologram away.

328
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:46,407
Speaker 1: I'm worshiping this hologram.

329
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:47,654
Speaker 1: stay the fuck away curtain man.

330
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:49,141
Speaker 1: Don't turn that shit off Now.

331
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:58,140
Speaker 0: in general though the people who and like I said people are playing overwatch and seem to not super like competitive mode I've seen a common theme and this is kind of my point here.

332
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:09,139
Speaker 0: the common theme among most of those people is that they're playing by themselves and They're salty that the matchmaking is not accommodating them that well and that they isn't it like the best matchmaking there is it is.

333
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,588
Speaker 0: but Overwatch was from the very beginning.

334
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,712
Speaker 0: It is a team game.

335
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:14,700
Speaker 0: It is a team of six versus a team of six.

336
00:21:15,061 --> 00:21:23,031
Speaker 0: It'd be like if I complained that the Detroit Lions are doing crappily even though one of their players is super good Like that player should be ranked up onto a different team.

337
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:26,412
Speaker 1: That's how all professional sports yeah,

338
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:30,513
Speaker 0: so The only the only complaints I'm seeing of normal

339
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:32,200
Speaker 1: basketball where one person can carry the team

340
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:44,789
Speaker 0: There's this article where someone pointed out the Skinner box from the inside and dared you to take it away from him And then everyone else is just mad about the fact that the game is actually a team game and you really got to play with The team like you got to have five friends.

341
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:46,980
Speaker 0: or it's not that good of a game.

342
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,056
Speaker 0: That's just like it's like every game the game before it in this vein.

343
00:21:50,097 --> 00:21:50,720
Speaker 0: It's a team game.

344
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,199
Speaker 0: You're playing a team game to win teams.

345
00:21:52,340 --> 00:22:01,092
Speaker 1: If you're really good at a game or believe you're really good at a game and you're sad because you keep losing all the time And you keep blaming it on your team and your name is not Alexander Ovechkin.

346
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,539
Speaker 1: You can go play a tiny-ass violin somewhere.

347
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:12,886
Speaker 0: So I got one last little news because this kind of happened today and it's just How are people so bad at this?

348
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:23,320
Speaker 1: Ubisoft which has had problems in the past which is like one of the worst game publishers There is maybe the worst even they're like damn and EA are the two worst game video game publishers of triple-a games.

349
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:25,527
Speaker 0: It's like on the other end of the spectrum.

350
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:28,778
Speaker 0: You got Blizzard who was just like by the numbers doing a blizzard.

351
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:29,340
Speaker 1: is Activision.

352
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:30,326
Speaker 1: They're not perfect.

353
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're worse than they used to be.

354
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,280
Speaker 0: Yeah But at the same time they're knocking everything that they focus on.

355
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:38,826
Speaker 1: Game publisher developer.

356
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:40,291
Speaker 1: that does everything right.

357
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:41,193
Speaker 0: everything right.

358
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:46,375
Speaker 1: the small team that made advance Wars That you mean Nintendo and it's not a small team.

359
00:22:46,556 --> 00:22:51,011
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess the Zach Tronics guy who keeps making the programming games.

360
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:53,240
Speaker 1: Ah, he seems to self publish them.

361
00:22:53,381 --> 00:23:00,049
Speaker 0: Anyway, Ubisoft put out a gamer survey to find out stuff about gamers And the first question it asks is if you're male or female.

362
00:23:00,831 --> 00:23:05,426
Speaker 0: if you say female it immediately ends and says Thank you for taking the time to believe the survey.

363
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:09,340
Speaker 0: Unfortunately, your profile does not suit our profile for this survey.

364
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:09,942
Speaker 1: All right.

365
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:15,166
Speaker 1: So first of all, if you're doing a survey and someone wants to give you free information Yeah, don't turn it away.

366
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:16,112
Speaker 1: Why would you turn it away?

367
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:21,841
Speaker 1: - Usually if you're running a certain your survey company, that's what you do You know.

368
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:33,320
Speaker 1: if you only want to know about like what dudes like and what you know various demographics old people young people You know Americans other people from other countries you do reports on the data you've collected.

369
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:43,319
Speaker 1: So when you're all done collecting all this data You can just be like select from Survey where gender equals M and you'll only get that data and it doesn't matter whether you collected the other data or not.

370
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:50,540
Speaker 1: So to filter it out, but also to tell the user you could even let them do the survey and just throw the data away.

371
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:53,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like I tell the user and but it's free data.

372
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:54,580
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't you just collect it?

373
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,440
Speaker 1: But especially why would you why would you tell them and create this fiasco?

374
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:05,798
Speaker 0: Like we know that there's a problem with the how dumb are you women like that's?

375
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:07,464
Speaker 1: it's like well Ubisoft doesn't?

376
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:11,000
Speaker 1: Ubisoft is one of the bad publishers who true women poorly now.

377
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,872
Speaker 0: They claimed a little while ago that quote there's a bug a bug.

378
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,681
Speaker 0: There was an error in the setup of the survey Uh-huh.

379
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:20,069
Speaker 0: It is now resolved and available to everyone.

380
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:20,490
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

381
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:22,236
Speaker 0: Apologies for any confusion.

382
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:22,778
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

383
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:30,395
Speaker 1: Yeah Also anyone who's doing fucking surveys Why are you fucking helping Ubisoft by giving them your information?

384
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:31,580
Speaker 1: stop doing surveys for people.

385
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,148
Speaker 1: The only survey you should be doing is the steam hardware survey.

386
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:35,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, that one's real important.

387
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:37,840
Speaker 1: Actually, don't do any other video game related surveys.

388
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:45,064
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

389
00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:50,421
Speaker 0: I have to because the 4th of July was yesterday at least have one 4th of July themed thing and I Do.

Speaker 1: I didn't know Walmart sold fireworks.

394
00:25:04,273 --> 00:25:08,044
Speaker 1: I guess if you're in Florida they do Like New York.

395
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:13,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, but someone set an entire fireworks aisle on fire in a Walmart.

396
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,558
Speaker 1: my hero I wonder what the insurance pay out it like.

397
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:20,260
Speaker 0: I Disapprove of what happened because that's dangerous and property destruction.

398
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:23,613
Speaker 0: But I approve of the tweet that I got to enjoy this in from.

399
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:24,978
Speaker 1: it's okay to do it to Walmart.

400
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:25,340
Speaker 1: fuck them.

401
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:28,492
Speaker 0: They're not even the worst anymore Like I would they're not.

402
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:29,320
Speaker 1: it's worse than Walmart.

403
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:32,714
Speaker 0: So I got a real thing of the day and you just got to see this.

404
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:33,115
Speaker 0: It's just.

405
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:34,179
Speaker 0: I tweeted it.

406
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:38,517
Speaker 0: I retweeted the thing and you should just click in here and see what's going on.

407
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:42,733
Speaker 1: after three clicks I realized what it was and and then didn't read didn't continue the.

408
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:46,486
Speaker 0: I followed it to its source And it was kind of worth it.

409
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:48,152
Speaker 1: You really have no time there.

410
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:49,297
Speaker 0: It's only like 20 deep.

411
00:25:49,337 --> 00:25:50,866
Speaker 0: like it's not that far I thought it was super deep.

412
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,095
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't as deep as you expect.

413
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,088
Speaker 1: I mean after three I'm like, I haven't got time for this shit.

414
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:54,450
Speaker 0: Yep.

415
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:57,366
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was a few clicks in was like Oh, I see what's going on here.

416
00:25:57,406 --> 00:26:00,279
Speaker 1: And then I was like, how far down does the rabbit hole go?

417
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,605
Speaker 0: So you got a thing of the day?

418
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:07,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this dude Commits a misdemeanor in this video.

419
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:09,256
Speaker 1: So crime on film here.

420
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:09,899
Speaker 1: Watch out.

421
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:12,928
Speaker 1: So they're at some bridge somewhere.

422
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:22,840
Speaker 1: I guess it's a car bridge that drives across like a river and He jumps off, but he's not doing the usual which would be bungee jumping or base jumping, right?

423
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,684
Speaker 1: Because you need a you know.

424
00:26:23,704 --> 00:26:27,560
Speaker 1: to span a bridge I guess counts as a span and you the s in base, right?

425
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,731
Speaker 1: No, he's got a rope and is just a rope.

426
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:33,644
Speaker 1: So you're thinking whoa, that could be dangerous Just a rope.

427
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:37,060
Speaker 1: you usually you bungee jump with the bungee thing because then you won't die.

428
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:50,785
Speaker 1: But he jumps off in such a way So as to not bungee and die and yet or spider-man Gwen Stacy yank and die but instead to swing Majestically then.

429
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,860
Speaker 0: therefore part of this video is the face he's making.

430
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,580
Speaker 1: Yeah He's got his GoPro on a stick and he's got it in slow-mo and you can see his friends down at the bottom And I wish you would have kept videoing when the cops came and gave him the ticket.

431
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:07,870
Speaker 0: But yeah, if I were the cop I would give him the ticket and then I would ask him if I could come back when I Was off duty and do it.

432
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,739
Speaker 1: I would totally do this.

433
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, this seems great as long as I knew the river was deep enough and someone else did it first.

434
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:20,660
Speaker 0: It's the kind of thing we did when it when a grown-up, you know I did a lot of reckless things with friends like out in the woods were involving rope swings and jumping off a shit and whatever.

435
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:25,999
Speaker 0: But I had a very specific rule someone else had to do it and survive before I would do it no matter what it was.

436
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:27,818
Speaker 1: That's my rule for a lot of things.

437
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:38,960
Speaker 0: So like cybernetic implants I would do this or replacing my body with a robot body in the moment The book club book was long ago the Wheel of Time the first of the Wheel of Time.

438
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,768
Speaker 0: I finished the 14th book of the Wheel of Time.

439
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:41,611
Speaker 1: Is that the last one?

440
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:43,580
Speaker 0: Ah, there's no more Wheel of Time.

441
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,446
Speaker 1: I know you've gone around the whole wheel.

442
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:46,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're out of time.

443
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:48,957
Speaker 0: No more time done with time.

444
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:49,900
Speaker 0: I made my time.

445
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,755
Speaker 0: My time is done.

446
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,760
Speaker 0: Move Randell tour and yeah, so the next book club book will be Oryx and Crake But it's much shorter than even one book of Wheel of Time.

447
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:07,432
Speaker 1: So even though we've been talking about this book for a long time and not actually doing the episode on it I'm gonna start reading it.

448
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:09,165
Speaker 0: probably like today I'm gonna start.

449
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:11,540
Speaker 1: we should be able to do the episode on it like in a couple weeks.

450
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:15,920
Speaker 0: In fact, if there's a lot of downtime in Connecticut, I might just finish it between traveling to and from Connecticut.

451
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:16,602
Speaker 0: Maybe.

452
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:24,980
Speaker 0: maybe the thing is it's a race because the next Prince of Nothing book comes out like any day But I have to reread so many princes of nothing.

453
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:32,880
Speaker 1: So I a couple years ago reread the first trilogy so I don't need to reread that I did But I still have to reread again because I forgot half the proper nouns.

454
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,715
Speaker 0: Uh, I think a lot of them don't matter like you don't really do.

455
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's an Ione?

456
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,379
Speaker 0: They're the ones with the steel masks, right?

457
00:28:40,224 --> 00:28:42,721
Speaker 1: And who are the evil like Sharam?

458
00:28:42,842 --> 00:28:47,020
Speaker 1: know the the the the priests who wear like red and they're totally like evil like the Mafia.

459
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:49,859
Speaker 1: Oh the the priest the Wizards who are evil.

460
00:28:51,382 --> 00:28:54,213
Speaker 0: That was the one of the Gnostic school or the anagogic schools.

461
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:54,996
Speaker 1: Yeah, what is that?

462
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:55,959
Speaker 1: What does the tusks say?

463
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,078
Speaker 0: Oh, no, we don't know what the fucking tough says.

464
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,475
Speaker 1: Who's the guy who hangs out with the tusks?

465
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:03,508
Speaker 1: Beard guy the priest guy.

466
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:05,878
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't remember his name the Pope guy.

467
00:29:05,938 --> 00:29:06,360
Speaker 1: basically.

468
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:09,048
Speaker 0: Well, that's all complicated.

469
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:12,198
Speaker 0: after what happens in the first series I know but I'm just saying what's his name?

470
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:13,366
Speaker 0: that matter He's dead.

471
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:14,458
Speaker 1: Is he dead?

472
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:17,545
Speaker 1: I don't think he's dead.

473
00:29:18,368 --> 00:29:20,194
Speaker 0: Did you read all the books that came out?

474
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:21,016
Speaker 0: Yes.

475
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:22,080
Speaker 0: Did I come before you?

476
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:28,195
Speaker 0: Anyway, a lot of people are dead by the end of the books that were written up to.

477
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:29,420
Speaker 1: pretty sure that guy's not dead.

478
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,478
Speaker 0: He's dead.

479
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,226
Speaker 1: We'll talk about this after this.

480
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:35,698
Speaker 0: didn't he die at the end of the stuff the book we just read?

481
00:29:35,718 --> 00:29:37,228
Speaker 1: no You're thinking about different guy.

482
00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:39,099
Speaker 0: Uh maybe.

483
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:44,440
Speaker 0: Anyway, the prince of nothing is like our favorite fantasy series ever and we've done a bunch of.

484
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:46,716
Speaker 1: I have to put a huge content warning on.

485
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:52,064
Speaker 1: yeah Dude, who writes it is like mad Misogynistic.

486
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:53,679
Speaker 1: yeah the books reflect this.

487
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:56,970
Speaker 1: The books also have stuff that I probably like.

488
00:29:57,532 --> 00:30:02,929
Speaker 1: if I saw in a movie I might get sick and usually I don't get sick Anything in a movie not even like each of the killer like we have.

489
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:13,080
Speaker 0: so interestingly Scott wheel of time does similar things later on Like when you start finding out about how compulsion works, it is the prince of nothing compulsion like a hundred percent.

490
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:16,390
Speaker 0: Oh, in fact, it's kind of worse because it's real bad.

491
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,517
Speaker 0: If you try to take it out of someone's brain anyway.

492
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:21,264
Speaker 0: anyway Yeah, prince of nothing.

493
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:24,274
Speaker 1: Is that what the rod of you know, the oath rod?

494
00:30:24,635 --> 00:30:26,100
Speaker 0: the oath rod does stuff like that.

495
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,778
Speaker 0: The oath rod does a lot of bad things to you.

496
00:30:28,101 --> 00:30:35,066
Speaker 0: Okay, this pain involved in the heartache and misery and shortened lifespans and yeah I am it's good bad news.

497
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,514
Speaker 0: But yeah, we really like the prince of nothing series.

498
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:44,587
Speaker 1: all all caveats notwithstanding it combines philosophy Wizards and history.

499
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:47,800
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's also a nice sort of sci-fi aliens.

500
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:53,080
Speaker 1: It's also a sort of mission at least and the bad guy is a sarcophagus inside of a tornado.

501
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:58,933
Speaker 0: It's got some Tolkien Deconstruction like what would elves really be like like that kind of thing like for real.

502
00:30:58,973 --> 00:30:59,716
Speaker 0: what else be lost?

503
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:00,740
Speaker 1: some barbarians also.

504
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:02,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, skill Vandy barbaria.

505
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:06,994
Speaker 0: It's also a very quotable series track a step.

506
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:17,911
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, so yeah We're gonna read orcs and Craig and we're gonna do a review of it Even though everyone's telling me I should have done the Handmaid's Tale.

507
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:19,820
Speaker 0: It's more relevant to modern American politics.

508
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,289
Speaker 1: Whatever just read all the.

509
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,175
Speaker 1: just read all this shit.

510
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:22,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got time.

511
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:28,445
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we're gonna be a kinetic on this weekend Like it's happening.

512
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:29,669
Speaker 0: We're gonna be there.

513
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,013
Speaker 0: We're running the panels department.

514
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:33,060
Speaker 0: We're doing some panels as well.

515
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,068
Speaker 0: I forget when they are but we're doing a Anime foreign anime openers on Friday.

516
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,200
Speaker 0: We're doing more foreign anime openers on Saturday.

517
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:47,507
Speaker 0: We're doing a professional Podcasting and live streaming on Sunday.

518
00:31:48,148 --> 00:31:51,757
Speaker 0: We're doing Atari game design and we're doing writing game rules.

519
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:53,702
Speaker 0: I think that's it Cuz.

520
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:55,588
Speaker 0: I just didn't really want to do a lot of panels this year.

521
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:57,996
Speaker 0: Otherwise, why don't you smart people?

522
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,000
Speaker 0: We know are doing panels.

523
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,990
Speaker 0: We made the panel.

524
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,100
Speaker 0: Well, I made the panel schedule.

525
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,220
Speaker 0: I think it's actually a the best panel schedule this con has ever had in terms of content.

526
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:07,105
Speaker 0: Like.

527
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:16,879
Speaker 0: I'm actually pretty proud of it and if you try to use the website that kinetic on has to let you see that schedule I Highly recommend you complain to them about the fun.

528
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:23,660
Speaker 0: So the first speedrun I ever saw that sort of made me really realize what the hell that was.

529
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:26,413
Speaker 0: Was that Mario 3 thing that we saw at our IT?

530
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:27,820
Speaker 1: This is so long ago.

531
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,570
Speaker 1: It's not any Mario 3 but that you've ever seen.

532
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,400
Speaker 0: basically like earliest days of you.

533
00:32:31,762 --> 00:32:38,589
Speaker 1: it was pretty much just world 8 1. right that you know the final world and It was a more than a 1.

534
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,980
Speaker 0: it was a few bits of world 8.

535
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:45,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a bunch of world 8 and normally I would just like I think a speedrun you'd fly over the p-wing or something.

536
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,106
Speaker 1: But he didn't do that.

537
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:53,100
Speaker 1: All right, I mean it's an auto scroller But this he's super optimized like jumping on the cannonballs in like a ridiculous way.

538
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:58,059
Speaker 1: It was like basically a miracle that the person could do this because it turned out a person couldn't do it.

539
00:32:58,401 --> 00:32:59,830
Speaker 0: That at least in that case though.

540
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,138
Speaker 1: I'm sure maybe a person can do it now.

541
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:11,530
Speaker 0: Yeah but that was a tool assisted speedrun and it was interesting because up until that point when I thought of the like I kind of Had the idea of like a speedrun because it wasn't like gamer.

542
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,260
Speaker 0: pop culture had not really crystallized all these ideas.

543
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,660
Speaker 1: I mean there were people playing video games for speed.

544
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:21,096
Speaker 1: Metroid told you how long it took for you to beat it and people tried to get faster times.

545
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:22,060
Speaker 0: people set records.

546
00:33:22,271 --> 00:33:23,583
Speaker 1: Yeah There were very contests.

547
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:30,740
Speaker 1: there are various games that had time as opposed to score and people you know had always been doing high score attack But people were also doing time attack.

548
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:41,685
Speaker 1: It just hadn't become a phenomenon until games done quick really made it into a community With you know to event two major events every year one of which is going on right now For some.

549
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:44,480
Speaker 1: according to rim, we've never done an episode on this.

550
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,971
Speaker 0: I couldn't find an episode on this.

551
00:33:46,112 --> 00:33:49,693
Speaker 1: if we're wrong Blame rim, how does that my fault?

552
00:33:49,714 --> 00:33:50,598
Speaker 1: We've done this episode.

553
00:33:50,639 --> 00:34:02,521
Speaker 0: All right now there was a community for this before a GDQ sort of did its thing, but you kind of had to know and People were still sort of arguing and fighting about like what counted what the terminology was Like.

554
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:03,988
Speaker 0: how exactly do you measure this?

555
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:06,278
Speaker 0: which emulators are like legit for it?

556
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:06,720
Speaker 1: streaming?

557
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:15,536
Speaker 1: Also made it a big thing because you could see people You know practicing and that made other people get hooked on Practicing and watching other people and it let people share their techniques with each other.

558
00:34:15,877 --> 00:34:21,056
Speaker 1: before that People would have to record and like share videos direct directly with each other.

559
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:23,568
Speaker 1: that Mario 3 thing We watched was like an mp4.

560
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:24,472
Speaker 1: We download.

561
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:26,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might have even been an AVI.

562
00:34:26,784 --> 00:34:28,598
Speaker 0: This was like free YouTube days guys.

563
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:34,639
Speaker 0: So what happened was basically now that there's a community around it live streaming is a thing.

564
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:42,480
Speaker 0: YouTube exists and the internet exists and everyone has access to it and Anime and gaming and all these conventions are like super easy and widespread.

565
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:51,219
Speaker 0: It was like the perfect time for an explosion and it got to the point of where people started breaking records That no one ever thought would be broke.

566
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:57,275
Speaker 1: I mean it really exploded like three or four years ago and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger Constantly every single year.

567
00:34:57,315 --> 00:35:03,540
Speaker 0: every year I look at the schedule of a GDQ and I'm shocked by at least one of the attempts that they're about to make and it's like.

568
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,264
Speaker 1: You think it's like.

569
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:06,495
Speaker 1: are there really new games they can go after?

570
00:35:06,556 --> 00:35:09,186
Speaker 1: are there really ways They can improve upon the games.

571
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:09,587
Speaker 1: They're already.

572
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:16,751
Speaker 1: they're still improving Final Fantasy for speed run Right and then on top of that there's always even for one game.

573
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:17,935
Speaker 1: There'll be so many different modes.

574
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:24,596
Speaker 0: any percent hundred percent Blindfolded it's like really into that hundred percent bionic commando in 30 minutes.

575
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:30,591
Speaker 1: I just watched blindfolded symphony of the night today, holy Crap, it's like.

576
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:31,420
Speaker 1: are you kidding me?

577
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,980
Speaker 1: This dude couldn't see he had problems in the library buying stuff.

578
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:40,299
Speaker 1: But the point is is like he still beat symphony of the night without seeing only audio.

579
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,774
Speaker 0: dude I'm not a hundred percent guaranteed to beat it non blindfolded.

580
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:47,616
Speaker 0: if I have all the time in the world I am I haven't played in a long time.

581
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:48,340
Speaker 0: I think I might die.

582
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,019
Speaker 0: It's not a hard game now, but I'm sure I die a bunch if I just picks up right now.

583
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:54,879
Speaker 0: I haven't played a metroidvania in at least three years.

584
00:35:55,981 --> 00:36:01,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I might die maybe in the upside-down castle if I sort of rush and don't take it easy.

585
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:05,813
Speaker 0: But I remember was also interesting about that speedrun that Mario 3 one that we saw.

586
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:08,381
Speaker 0: that really sort of like got me interested in This.

587
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:11,000
Speaker 0: that's why I got into the community in those days not doing it.

588
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,124
Speaker 0: I'll never be that good now.

589
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:26,671
Speaker 0: but like finding them and watching them and learning about them was that it wasn't just a Like Fox only Final Destination style like heavyset mouth breather staring at the screen not saying anything Perfect run doing no extraneous actions.

590
00:36:27,273 --> 00:36:28,296
Speaker 0: This was parkour.

591
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:28,818
Speaker 0: This was a show.

592
00:36:30,202 --> 00:36:34,400
Speaker 0: This was someone showing off taking risks, right?

593
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:41,420
Speaker 1: cuz I mean think you had this video game and you have to beat it as fast as you can and You have to do this without hacking the game.

594
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:48,800
Speaker 1: It's like normally you'd hack the game right or you know, you do something like that But no only by pressing the buttons on the controller and doing nothing else.

595
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,322
Speaker 1: You're not allowed.

596
00:36:49,463 --> 00:36:55,271
Speaker 1: you can push the buttons on the console to like the reset button maybe depending on the rules But you all you can do is push buttons.

597
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:56,920
Speaker 1: So how can you beat the game faster?

598
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,439
Speaker 1: You think like Mario 1 it's like well hold B and right and jump and don't ever let go of right or B Unless you got to shoot a fireball or something.

599
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,360
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like you know that is that really as fast as you can go and then you start to see things like basic techniques.

600
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:17,080
Speaker 1: for example in They have the thing where you turn backwards do a back dash and then bring your shield out to cancel the animation.

601
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:31,620
Speaker 1: so you go and You go really really fast because the back dash is really fast and by canceling it with the shield You can just keep back dashing constantly without you know The sort of ending animation of it and go whoosh much faster than you could run just going forward.

602
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:40,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, suddenly when you see someone playing Castlevania Symphony tonight, they're always going backwards going And that's like beginner mode of speedrun.

603
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:42,545
Speaker 0: yep, and then what?

604
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:43,828
Speaker 0: what this is culminated into?

605
00:37:43,908 --> 00:38:02,000
Speaker 0: and I guess my favorite thing now is that the community is so big that there Can be races with two three four people playing a multi-hour game in a race Sometimes even taking different routes, so you don't even know who's ahead until the end and they finish within seconds of each other.

606
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,876
Speaker 0: Yep, like that is the point that we're in today, and they're optimizing so much to where they're like.

607
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:10,420
Speaker 1: ah do that You know I'm doing the safety strat.

608
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,608
Speaker 1: It only loses like two seconds versus the.

609
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:20,256
Speaker 1: you know as she means that when they're not doing the safety strat because it's not AGDQ or SGDQ they do this other thing that is much riskier.

610
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,102
Speaker 1: just to save two seconds They're gonna cuz.

611
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,090
Speaker 0: you know some people are going for the world record like you.

612
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:28,150
Speaker 1: try over and over those two seconds keep adding up right two seconds here two seconds there.

613
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,458
Speaker 1: suddenly you're a minute faster.

614
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:37,820
Speaker 0: and But because of the performance aspect of it This is like the generation where AGDQ made this happen by turning it into a performance.

615
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,593
Speaker 0: The tool assisted runs are like their own sort of thing.

616
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:47,120
Speaker 0: and be like you know I did it a million times and the video you see of his world record is the best of them.

617
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:55,303
Speaker 0: It's very different when it is a performance where there's a human in front of an audience a giant audience live Performing for

618
00:38:55,343 --> 00:39:08,207
Speaker 1: you right, but the the tool assisted ones are actually really important because even though like you know You might not be impressed with them because a person didn't do it It took a lot of work to make it because a person sat there going through the game frame by frame Figuring out the best way to do

619
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:08,348
Speaker 0: it.

620
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:12,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though it didn't take a lot as much skill It took a lot more effort.

621
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:20,291
Speaker 1: But also by doing those tool assisted speed runs it gives the people doing the by hand real speed runs Something to look at and say aha.

622
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:21,760
Speaker 1: That's the fastest way.

623
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:25,531
Speaker 1: Let's see how much of that it's possible for a human to do.

624
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:30,760
Speaker 1: and there's a lot of like frame perfect things that people can Do very consistently because they're gods.

625
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,889
Speaker 0: Now now I think we were on.

626
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,640
Speaker 0: I was watching one of the earlier ones.

627
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:44,228
Speaker 0: it was the the most recent link between worlds DS run and Well 3ds and the guy was just sort of talking and he gets at one point where he's like All right, this move coming up.

628
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:47,824
Speaker 0: I gotta be too almost frame perfect.

629
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:57,919
Speaker 0: and then they start talking to each other about how many frames they have to input the command and then one of Them laughs and points out something that hey coming up is the other one the frame perfect one be.

630
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:05,220
Speaker 0: Literally you have to input a control on one specific frame or it fails, right?

631
00:40:05,743 --> 00:40:06,025
Speaker 0: So

632
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:21,660
Speaker 1: for people to understand when you program a video game Almost every video game is programmed using this very similar coding structure where you have a loop the main loop and basically The loop starts and a bunch of code gets executed the computers doing math math math math math math math math math math.

633
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:26,860
Speaker 1: And then when it gets to the very bottom of the loop, it basically has to draw the screen.

634
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:38,760
Speaker 1: So if your screen is, you know, 1080p's you've got 1080 by you know pixels Right to draw and it basically has to create in memory, you know, which color it goes in all those pixels.

635
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,189
Speaker 1: So this pixels green this pixels blue and so on.

636
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:48,460
Speaker 1: and then it puts that you know Array of color information to the video card and then it gets drawn on the monitor.

637
00:40:49,102 --> 00:40:57,407
Speaker 1: And if your game is running at say 60 FPS, that is loop has to go all the way through 60 times every second.

638
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:01,739
Speaker 1: also in this loop is the code that says are they pressing a?

639
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:15,251
Speaker 1: If they're pressing a make Mario jump if he's on the ground obvious, right, you know, so that code is happening 60 times a second which means in any given second You could press a on the.

640
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:18,323
Speaker 1: you know, there it's cut into 60 slices Right.

641
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:19,787
Speaker 1: So 160th.

642
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:23,659
Speaker 1: if it's a 60 FPS game what every 60th of a second?

643
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:25,500
Speaker 1: It would be a difference.

644
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:31,451
Speaker 1: So if you push a on the first 60th or the second 60th It's impossible to push a on anywhere in between.

645
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:32,958
Speaker 1: that because it's the loop.

646
00:41:32,998 --> 00:41:35,126
Speaker 1: go, you know The loop executes one at a time, right?

647
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:39,200
Speaker 1: So you have 60 chances every second in a 60 FPS game.

648
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:51,800
Speaker 1: So if it's a 30 FPS game You have 30 chances every second to press the button and you have to press it on an exact very specific One of those loops like that loop that the tenth one is the one we had to push the button.

649
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:55,279
Speaker 1: That's how hard this is to do a frame perfect thing.

650
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:55,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

651
00:41:57,303 --> 00:41:59,863
Speaker 1: So it's it's like oh my god, you know You have you.

652
00:41:59,983 --> 00:42:06,354
Speaker 1: you have one second in the game and on this one like fraction of that second That's when you had to press the button.

653
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,904
Speaker 0: now I guess what also I like.

654
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:09,230
Speaker 0: but this is sort of a wider point.

655
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:13,807
Speaker 0: that sort of it's affecting a lot of people who make Content or do streams or anything on the internet.

656
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:30,720
Speaker 0: but because live streaming has such a strong community now And because these speedrun people are like pushing this art as far as they can already Unless you are like of that caliber like you have to be so good to even warrant anyone watching you at this point.

657
00:42:31,054 --> 00:42:34,860
Speaker 1: well They seem to have like this big community going on and you can go to their website.

658
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:43,022
Speaker 1: And even though if you were to say start, you know There are always people when I watch this who like oh we got a new guy playing Super Metroid Is he?

659
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:45,200
Speaker 1: Super Metroid is the most speedrun game?

660
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,529
Speaker 1: But someone will just start doing it and they could.

661
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:52,240
Speaker 1: they learned everything from the previous people by watching them and they have skills.

662
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:59,440
Speaker 1: So they like level up and become Just as good if not better than the people already doing it in a short a matter of time because they have skills.

663
00:42:59,982 --> 00:43:06,926
Speaker 1: but there are people with less skills who choose less popular games and Because there's less competition there.

664
00:43:06,946 --> 00:43:10,820
Speaker 1: right and you think you know, how about you pick some weirdo game?

665
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,260
Speaker 0: Well, the best example of this ever watched the speedrun on a GDQ of super pitfall.

666
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:24,420
Speaker 0: It is hilarious because that game is so bad and so broken and so glitchy and the guy doing the speedrun Knows literally everything there is to know about the game.

667
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:29,442
Speaker 1: I mean I've seen speedruns on there like people were doing like Lion King and it's like How many.

668
00:43:29,462 --> 00:43:30,789
Speaker 1: and there's like a community of people.

669
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:35,228
Speaker 1: like it's probably only less than 10 people But it's like they're the Lion King speedrunners.

670
00:43:35,268 --> 00:43:46,295
Speaker 1: Like there's that many people on earth who are like putting effort into playing that game as fast as possible and they send someone to the Multiple people to the games done quick and you watch them play it.

671
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:50,335
Speaker 1: and it's like wow It only took like 10 people to optimize the hell out of this game.

672
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:51,400
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

673
00:43:51,922 --> 00:44:04,226
Speaker 1: and it's like so no matter you know, you can get into this it with a lower level of skill because even if you can't Even if you're not the person who can push the button with frame perfect timing You can still contribute in many ways.

674
00:44:04,287 --> 00:44:05,811
Speaker 1: right by simply trying it.

675
00:44:06,092 --> 00:44:08,900
Speaker 1: you can find tricks to help the guy who can execute them.

676
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:10,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know you can do the top.

677
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:14,167
Speaker 1: the tool assisted speedrun to figure everything out, you know You can.

678
00:44:14,473 --> 00:44:17,960
Speaker 1: you know There's so many things you can do in this community if you want to if that's your interest.

679
00:44:18,401 --> 00:44:24,763
Speaker 1: The thing is ice is one of those hobbies where I think can only be meaningful if you dedicate a huge amount of time To it like you.

680
00:44:24,803 --> 00:44:25,708
Speaker 1: make it your thing.

681
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,800
Speaker 0: You can't dabble you can't you know.

682
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,107
Speaker 1: Do other too many other hobbies like.

683
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:34,480
Speaker 1: if you're also like an anime fan and you're making a webcomic you can't be also speedrunning.

684
00:44:35,403 --> 00:44:47,498
Speaker 1: Right, but if you're only speedrunning I notice a lot of the speedrun people speedrun multiple games because once you sort of get the skills of speedrunning You can sort of do a lot of similar games or a lot of games to the same system.

685
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:54,740
Speaker 1: or you know You can really work yourself up and you know get a huge repertoire and not just concentrate on one game only.

686
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:05,260
Speaker 0: Yeah I guess my favorite speedruns now are the live Performance ones with good commentary like someone who is kind of talking about the game or doing something interesting while they're playing.

687
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:07,260
Speaker 0: It's not just the speedrun.

688
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:10,731
Speaker 1: I like the ones where there's just there are things in the game.

689
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:12,637
Speaker 1: that is that you dislike don't think of.

690
00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:17,200
Speaker 1: right like a boring One is like just he runs to the right as fast as the game lets him and jumps and everything.

691
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:28,920
Speaker 0: the more weird stuff like the Final Fantasy 4 one where they like they got the random seed in a certain way and then He knew like what every encounter would be along the way for like hours of this game.

692
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:37,903
Speaker 1: Yeah any the weirder trick you found the more fascinating thing that you way to speed up this game that you have discovered and That's awesome.

693
00:45:37,923 --> 00:45:39,188
Speaker 1: Er to look at right.

694
00:45:39,229 --> 00:45:41,820
Speaker 1: that makes it more interesting from a spectators perspective.

695
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:45,251
Speaker 0: Yep, and I do appreciate I think I hate to say this.

696
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:54,262
Speaker 0: I think the showmanship of a GDQ is Getting to the point where it started surpassing a lot of what the competitive game circuit does Like.

697
00:45:54,302 --> 00:45:58,034
Speaker 0: take your average fighting game tournament versus your average live streamer event last year.

698
00:45:58,054 --> 00:46:07,324
Speaker 0: events tend to have better Production values and better announcing and everything, but it might be a side effect of the fact that there aren't as many Actual events like.

699
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:09,933
Speaker 1: it's not like a ladder as a charity organization.

700
00:46:09,973 --> 00:46:11,800
Speaker 1: It's not like a profit organization.

701
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,674
Speaker 0: That's you know, yeah, but I'm saying they do a really good job.

702
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:23,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it is I know that I know you know I know the people doing it right and they're like the people who do that kind of stuff like at a pax or at another Convention, but that is really good at it.

703
00:46:23,846 --> 00:46:28,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're doing it, you know volunteering because it's you know, they want to help it out.

704
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:34,176
Speaker 0: So the other thing I'm enjoying lately is the the weird mode stream.

705
00:46:34,316 --> 00:46:44,548
Speaker 0: a lot of speed runs Like the example I came up with that no one's blindfold to p1c Or like mario 2. you're not allowed to run Like that kind of nonsense.

706
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,554
Speaker 0: It's basically gum.

707
00:46:45,574 --> 00:46:46,580
Speaker 0: Take deathmatch, right?

708
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:53,325
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you can just make things more interesting, you know blindfolded punch-out, you know started off as like well I can sort of get to Mike Tyson.

709
00:46:53,345 --> 00:46:54,510
Speaker 1: then they were beating Mike Tyson.

710
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,220
Speaker 1: No problem the next year blindfolded, right?

711
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,821
Speaker 1: Now they're doing.

712
00:46:58,002 --> 00:47:01,352
Speaker 1: now the guy just beat blindfolded Symphony in the night, you know, what?

713
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:03,760
Speaker 1: what's next thing like well blindfolded Super Metroid.

714
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,775
Speaker 0: It's like I don't wait for the point where guys like instead of controller.

715
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:09,100
Speaker 0: I'm manipulating the wires.

716
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,231
Speaker 0: I've shoved them into my fingers, right?

717
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,840
Speaker 1: The 2p1c is really good.

718
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,975
Speaker 1: We get two people on one controller and so one person's got the arrows another person has the buttons.

719
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:19,484
Speaker 0: That's really fun Especially when they're still.

720
00:47:19,524 --> 00:47:21,713
Speaker 1: how much do they practice moves, right?

721
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:23,039
Speaker 1: It's like they practice that much.

722
00:47:23,865 --> 00:47:25,782
Speaker 1: Well, it's like if you both you know think about it.

723
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:31,469
Speaker 1: if I play this game and I get the perfect muscle memory in my left and right hand and you get the Same exact muscle memory.
