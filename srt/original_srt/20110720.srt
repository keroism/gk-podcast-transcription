6
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:30,730
Speaker 1: So we did a show about nothing last week, and I remember the the impetus where that was not seinfeld.

7
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:36,829
Speaker 1: It was that I thought oh, I know I'll read a dirty limerick And then I'll just go from there with random stuff.

8
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:44,061
Speaker 1: And then I forgot about the limerick and we just talked about actually nothing for what an hour Because we couldn't come up with the show and we were lazy whatever.

9
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:45,950
Speaker 1: so a little backstory.

10
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,570
Speaker 1: We were at RIT and there was a book of limericks.

11
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:55,030
Speaker 1: It's just called limericks, and it was like two dollars at the bookstore.

12
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:58,680
Speaker 1: So we were like oh, yeah, we'll buy this turns out.

13
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:00,906
Speaker 1: It wasn't just limericks.

14
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:07,086
Speaker 1: It was primarily Dirty limericks or at least suppose if it's not dirty.

15
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:07,990
Speaker 0: It's not a limerick.

16
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:17,452
Speaker 1: So I have opened just now to a random page and every episode of geek nights henceforth either in the beginning or during the meta moment I'm going to read a Random.

00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:58,930
Speaker 1: I kind of want to go some year.

50
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,590
Speaker 1: It's just I'm always busy.

51
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:02,818
Speaker 1: It's not really the kind of thing we like.

52
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:07,615
Speaker 1: I always kind of forget to like say hope panels or lectures or whatever It's like in the one hand.

53
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:10,568
Speaker 0: It's like the exact opposite of a convention that we want to go to.

54
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:11,853
Speaker 1: yeah I mean, what do we go to?

55
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:15,004
Speaker 1: we go to like really participatory conventions like PAX.

56
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:16,550
Speaker 1: we go to super party.

57
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,308
Speaker 0: San Diego comic-con is a big room of booths and waiting in line to see famous people.

58
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:25,928
Speaker 1: now granted We go to that with the New York comic-con, but it's right there.

59
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:26,290
Speaker 1: That's right.

60
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,314
Speaker 1: It's like next door.

61
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:28,800
Speaker 0: We don't have to fly to San Diego.

62
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:31,070
Speaker 0: meanwhile the thing starts fucking Wednesday night.

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,439
Speaker 0: Yeah If you want to go to it you have to buy tickets a year in advance and get your hotels here in advance and pay A zillion dollars and fly to San Diego.

64
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:38,022
Speaker 1: or what.

65
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:39,550
Speaker 1: we could get a professional badge or something.

66
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,149
Speaker 1: I'm sure we could get a badge without having to do all that BS.

67
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,015
Speaker 0: You'd be surprised.

68
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:53,010
Speaker 0: This is like one level up from our usual convention because it's got real famous people Yeah, but at the same time a level famous while getting like guests and all that stuff at those conventions is difficult.

69
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,469
Speaker 1: There's one thing that through this to this day is not that difficult and that is the press pass.

70
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:03,505
Speaker 0: San Diego comic-con press pass is harder than you think but at the same time easier than you'd expect.

71
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:10,263
Speaker 1: I'm sorry comic-con international So we will not be there but someday I'll go.

72
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:11,750
Speaker 1: maybe we'll just go as attendees or something.

73
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that one thing that I found weird right is like, you know, there's gonna be a bunch of stuff there But I don't actually need to be there for any of it, right?

74
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,529
Speaker 0: The only thing you would actually need to be there for is like a panel that no one videos But they're always gonna video the funny part.

75
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:28,085
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and they're always gonna sneak a camera into the you know premieres or whatever.

76
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:32,117
Speaker 0: the sneak peek of course But it's the there is always.

77
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:37,030
Speaker 0: the one thing you do have to be there for is the exclusive limited-edition swag.

78
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,063
Speaker 0: But of course, we don't give a shit about exclusive limited-edition swag.

79
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:49,282
Speaker 0: And if you do, you know what eBay Except when it's a limited to five thousand Special my little pony poster god damn it.

80
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:50,727
Speaker 1: How did they know by Hasbro?

81
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:56,172
Speaker 0: And if you look at this thing, it's definitely a fan Appeal.

00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,094
Speaker 0: it's got derpy.

83
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:59,702

Speaker 1: but give me Give me another two weeks until I no longer work for a company where I'm not able to talk about Stocks and companies and things.

Speaker 1: and I got stuff to say anyway, so it's warm today.

89
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:20,109
Speaker 1: It is the warmest so warm.

90
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,844
Speaker 1: In the studio I have suffered through some goddamn heat.

91
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,890
Speaker 1: we used to turn that AC off religiously.

92
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,372
Speaker 1: You know what?

93
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:33,304
Speaker 0: It is too hot to do that, you know, isn't there a way that you could?

94
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:34,830
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm so much smog.

95
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:36,690
Speaker 1: Look, I live we have a luxury apartment.

96
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,685
Speaker 1: The studio has a window overlooking the East River and Manhattan at like 59th Street.

97
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:46,510
Speaker 1: Like we can see Manhattan right now Manhattan is almost entirely obscured by smog.

98
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:47,794
Speaker 1: I've never seen anything.

99
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:52,671
Speaker 0: all the buildings are just silhouettes with no color and I can only see the first row of Buildings.

100
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:57,004
Speaker 0: the second row of buildings is sort of like have gray and that is legit smog something.

101
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:58,750
Speaker 1: I've never seen in person before.

102
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:02,218
Speaker 1: It could be a really low cloud.

103
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,140
Speaker 0: That's smog.

104
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:05,387
Speaker 1: There is no way that is not smog.

105
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:06,510
Speaker 0: It could be just haze.

106
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:07,859
Speaker 1: I don't think it's haze.

107
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,371
Speaker 0: Haze is not that thick It's.

108
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:12,959
Speaker 0: it's super haze but it's not that humid double.

109
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,447
Speaker 1: hey if that were haze it would be more humid.

110
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:16,330
Speaker 0: It's pretty humid.

111
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:17,136

Speaker 0: I don't give a shit because you know what reasons got one.

121
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:31,436
Speaker 0: I did not want it to be.

122
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:34,050
Speaker 0: I just think back to when it was motherfucking cold.

123
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:37,263
Speaker 0: You know fucking space nuts frozen off and I'm like this is.

124
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:38,689
Speaker 0: I'm happy with this.

125
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:40,980
Speaker 1: I can deal with many things.

126
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,070
Speaker 1: I can deal with horrible fanboys.

127
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:51,650
Speaker 1: everyone knows Scott would always be amazed at RIT way back in the day and how Polite and nice I could be to horrible fanboys.

128
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:52,988
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna get out of my face man.

129
00:06:53,852 --> 00:07:02,360
Speaker 1: I can abide a lot of BS from people but I cannot abide someone who complains that it's too cold in the winter and Complains that it's too hot in the summer.

130
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,909
Speaker 1: you get to complain about one season.

131
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:04,530
Speaker 0: That's right.

132
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,907
Speaker 1: That is all you get to complain about if you complain about both.

133
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,394
Speaker 0: good No, cuz what these people?

134
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,160
Speaker 0: let me let me be these stupid people.

135
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,790
Speaker 1: They want it to be 74 degrees and boring.

136
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:19,270
Speaker 0: They're like, oh, you know, I like the weather when it's kind of warm, but not too warm, but not too cold.

137
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,890
Speaker 0: I like it to be 65 70.

138
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:27,203
Speaker 1: I think they're the same people when they order food at a restaurant Want something very particular like can you replace my rice with this?

139
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:29,350
Speaker 1: and I'd rather have this and I want it cooked exactly like this.

00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,630
Speaker 1: And it's John Travolta playing John Travolta.

155
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:02,267
Speaker 1: It's kind of like a fanfic about John Travolta.

156
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:02,750
Speaker 0: All right.

157
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,670
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point is don't be complaining about hot and cold weather.

158
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:09,517
Speaker 0: Otherwise you suck and be.

159
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:11,545
Speaker 0: don't be being weird at restaurants.

160
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:12,850
Speaker 0: Just fucking pick something on the menu.

161
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,893
Speaker 0: Don't be all asking what's in this what's in that it wouldn't be Here?

162
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:18,717
Speaker 1: are legitimate.

163
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:19,660
Speaker 0: have an allergy.

164
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:20,584
Speaker 0: you have an allergy.

165
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:21,990
Speaker 1: you have celiac disease.

166
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,335
Speaker 1: It is okay to be like is there?

167
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:24,680
Speaker 0: celiac disease is an allergy.

168
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,266
Speaker 1: No, it's an autoimmune thing.

169
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:27,657
Speaker 1: It's distinct from allergies It's.

170
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:28,348
Speaker 0: it's the same.

171
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:36,626
Speaker 1: You have a food problem because celiac if you have a food allergy and you eat a food that you're allergic to throat swells up and shit hives.

172
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:39,379
Speaker 1: Celiac doesn't have any of that thing instead.

173
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,369
Speaker 1: It's just an autoimmune like attack in the gut.

174
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:49,150
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know hives is an autoimmune attack in the skin, but they're distinct and EpiPens not gonna help you with celiac.

175
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:55,530
Speaker 1: Anyway I'm sure Nuri is gonna be like you guys are both wrong, whatever.

176
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:03,853
Speaker 0: So my news is that it's warm and here at the NOAA the National Oceanographic You don't know.

177
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:05,078
Speaker 1: do you something?

178
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,747
Speaker 0: American now atmospheric administration?

179
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:08,369
Speaker 0: That's it.

180
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,462
Speaker 1: That sounds like an organization that administers the atmosphere.

181
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:23,050
Speaker 0: if you don't know about the NOAA It is paid for with federal tax money and there are people who are against it on the grounds that it's unfair competition with like the Weather Channel Except the Weather Channel gets their weather from the NOAA.

182
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:26,630
Speaker 1: In fact, almost everyone who reports on weather just gets it from the NOAA.

183
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:33,150
Speaker 0: So every weather you watch is just taking the weather from the NOAA and then reporting it except for weather underground Which has citizen weather stations.

184
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:40,461
Speaker 0: Anyway, you should get your weather from there because it's you're you're paying for it And they have the best weathers and it's free.

185
00:09:40,642 --> 00:09:52,600
Speaker 0: and they made this little video Of a heat of the heat wave and it shows you day by day where the heat wave at and basically looks like full 1080p like Texas caught on fire and that fire spread.

186
00:09:52,820 --> 00:10:02,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like a 1080p video of the heat wave from July 13th through tomorrow, but 105

187
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:05,130
Speaker 1: degrees in the seven tunnel under Grand Central today

188
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:12,999
Speaker 0: I heard there was somewhere that it was a hundred and seventeen like in Minneapolis or something in that at the Moat a Particular time it was the hottest and humidest place on earth

189
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,704
Speaker 1: the hottest weather.

190
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:16,430
Speaker 0: I guess short of short of a volcano.

191
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:19,381
Speaker 1: I've been in a hundred and six degree heat.

192
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,990
Speaker 1: That is the hottest outdoor temperature I've ever experienced.

193
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,416
Speaker 0: I don't know what the hottest I've been in is.

194
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,054
Speaker 1: I'm maybe it was hotter one day and I didn't know but Yeah, it's hot.

195
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,726
Speaker 1: We can't stop talking about it cuz it's just so hot but it's good.

196
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,408
Speaker 0: It's great.

197
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:33,890
Speaker 0: I'll take it.

198
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,162
Speaker 1: So anyway, so uh SDCC this weekend, we won't be there.

199
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:39,004
Speaker 1: Otacon.

200
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,990
Speaker 0: I'm sure there'll be a zillion news for next Wednesday.

201
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:43,558
Speaker 1: We will also not be at Otacon.

202
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:48,105
Speaker 1: so I'll just say this we're known we have no blood blood for Otacon But they do not like us so much.

203
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:53,850
Speaker 1: Oh, well So if you want us to go to Otacon just tell Otacon that you want us to do our stuff at Otacon.

204
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:55,019
Speaker 1: We'll do it if they ask us.

205
00:10:55,482 --> 00:11:03,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that aside You probably should be going to Otacon even if we're not there because as we've said Makoto Shinkai Is gonna be there.

206
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:06,290
Speaker 0: if you don't know who Makoto Shinkai is you need to watch all his movies.

207
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,690
Speaker 1: Such basically just watch him in order.

208
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:14,890
Speaker 0: He is the guy who made an anime called Hoshino Koei voices of a distant star in his basement with his wife with his wife.

209
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:19,546
Speaker 0: They voiced it then they got it re-voiced but later and it is like what five ten minutes.

210
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:20,790
Speaker 0: It's short, but it's amazing.

211
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:25,503
Speaker 1: It's I defy other than people who really fight it or who aren't human.

212
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:27,870
Speaker 1: You're gonna cry, you know fucking cry.

213
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:36,365
Speaker 0: but he pretty much draws clouds and Movies and well short animations about sad people in relationships separated by space and time.

214
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:40,901
Speaker 1: space and time drama sad Longing distant love, right?

215
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:42,370
Speaker 0: That's all he makes but he's going by.

216
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,341
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with being a one-trick pony if you're awesome at that trick And it's not a trick anyone else has done and such and such.

217
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:55,062
Speaker 1: so he also made The full-length movie Place Promised in our early days, which I really like.

218
00:11:55,082 --> 00:12:00,355
Speaker 1: Hoshino Koei, but I like Place Promised more But that seemed that way.

219
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:05,330
Speaker 1: the place promised in our early days has some some of the most beautiful skyscapes I've ever seen.

220
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,770
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, cuz he draws clouds.

221
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:09,697
Speaker 1: Awesome plane with the two like propellers.

222
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:17,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it has either the saddest happy ending or the happiest sad ending I've ever seen does have a terrible secret of space.

223
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:20,388
Speaker 0: it does typical from animes the mysterious tower in the distance.

224
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:28,519
Speaker 1: Yeah he did five centimeters per second, which is just a TV series of lovers separated by space and time.

225
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,421
Speaker 0: and his.

226
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:30,484
Speaker 0: what's the new thing called?

227
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:32,289
Speaker 1: It is called Hoshi.

228
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:34,051
Speaker 1: Oh Kodomo.

229
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:34,753
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

230
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:36,858
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's a new thing.

231
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:37,380
Speaker 0: He made.

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,410
Speaker 0: it's gonna be screened at Otakon premiered with no subtitles.

233
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:44,121
Speaker 1: Children who chase lost voices from deep below.

234
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:45,547
Speaker 0: I'm sure it will be stunning.

235
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:48,236
Speaker 1: Yep I'm pretty sure that there's a picture.

236
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:49,681
Speaker 0: if you don't understand what's going on.

237
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:53,265
Speaker 1: There is a picture probably a movie poster in the article I'm going to link to.

238
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:55,699
Speaker 1: and Yeah, I want to see that.

239
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,110
Speaker 0: please videotape his panel.

240
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:01,318
Speaker 1: Oh my god, if we were at Otakon with Emily She would just translate the whole thing for us while we were sitting there.

241
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:01,940
Speaker 0: That's true.

242
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,690
Speaker 0: But please videotape the panel so I can see it.

243
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,070
Speaker 0: Yes, and don't videotape the movie because Otakon will kick your ass out.

244
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,597
Speaker 0: I can wait for that to be on DVD.

245
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:12,612
Speaker 1: if you are at Otakon go to the Q&A People.

246
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,138
Speaker 1: don't go to the guest panels.

247
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:14,821
Speaker 0: They do.

248
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:17,090
Speaker 0: they just go to like voice actors and other stupid shit.

249
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:23,701
Speaker 0: They don't go to the Japanese people who came all the way from halfway around the world To see you and you and I'll like ten people show up and simultaneously.

250
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:26,229
Speaker 1: the anime cons don't do anything about this.

251
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:27,293
Speaker 0: They don't try.

252
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:30,163
Speaker 1: I mean the New York Anime Festival did try when they got mr.

253
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:30,564
Speaker 1: Gundam.

254
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:32,812
Speaker 1: They were like, holy shit We got mr.

255
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:33,956
Speaker 0: Gundam and then they fucked up.

256
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:37,690
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, they fucked up the translator, but that room was packed.

257
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:47,020
Speaker 1: It was indeed and I think more people went to see him at Otak at that New York Comic Con Anime Festival just because they pumped him up then.

258
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:51,595
Speaker 1: anyone has ever seen anyone who was Japanese At any other anime con ever?

259
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:55,908
Speaker 0: quite possibly except maybe yoko kano, maybe I don't know which was.

260
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:57,654
Speaker 0: I had no to count But that was a concert.

261
00:13:57,694 --> 00:13:58,517
Speaker 0: a concert doesn't care.

262
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,943
Speaker 0: We're talking about a panel not a concert.

263
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:03,650
Speaker 0: concerts are different because here's someone talk Versus to hear someone sees them and perform.

264
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:08,246
Speaker 1: Yeah just one of my saddest memories is going to the anime central and they're not anime central.

265
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:12,320
Speaker 1: anime next and Just randomly walking into a big gigantic panel room.

266
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,035
Speaker 1: There's only a few people sitting around and up front We're like, is that Rintaro?

267
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:19,147
Speaker 0: It was oh my god, the director the director of the movie.

268
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:31,565
Speaker 1: We'll discuss today Yes But before that we have of course things of the day.

269
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,414
Speaker 1: so if you I'm living under a rock.

270
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:39,168
Speaker 1: You might not realize that my little pony friendship is magic is legit more ponies.

271
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:41,615
Speaker 1: I got it Before we did the show.

272
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:44,690
Speaker 1: Scott is basically just going item by item down radio.

273
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,009
Speaker 0: That doesn't mean I want to put it in geek nights.

274
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:51,210
Speaker 1: I needed a thing of the day and one thing that is very popular in Japan.

275
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:52,000
Speaker 1: That does not happen.

276
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,486
Speaker 1: as much in the?

277
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:52,769
Speaker 1: u.s.

278
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:59,604
Speaker 1: Is taking the opening to an anime or an animation or something and Reanimating it with characters from something else.

279
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:04,405
Speaker 0: Yeah Americans Remixers tend to be lazier and they take paths of least resistance.

280
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:08,930
Speaker 0: They like to edit videos They don't like to make new animation and or you know, because it's a lot of work.

281
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:11,090
Speaker 1: So it's a very like Japanese fandom thing.

282
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,607
Speaker 1: So that's why I'm using it today because this is someone did that sort of thing in flash to the.

283
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,309
Speaker 1: my little pony.

284
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:22,596
Speaker 1: friendship is magic opener, but they portrayed all the ponies as Girls like human girls.

285
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:23,238
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

286
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:24,564
Speaker 1: It's pretty cute.

287
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,401
Speaker 0: Okay, so You know when it comes to webcomics, right?

288
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:31,610
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of different categories of web comics.

289
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,435
Speaker 0: I sort of realized.

290
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:32,596
Speaker 0: right.

291
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:33,904
Speaker 0: there's the pure webcomic.

292
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:34,950
Speaker 0: It was a webcomic.

293
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,082
Speaker 0: It always will be a webcomic like say a penny arcade or a dr.

294
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:43,755
Speaker 0: McNinja, right or something like that Or boases, right.

295
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:44,738
Speaker 0: then there's the.

296
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,388
Speaker 0: it's a newspaper comic, but you can read it on the web, which is all the newspaper.

297
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:48,870
Speaker 1: Thanks.

298
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:52,017
Speaker 0: But then there's sort of the.

299
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:56,250
Speaker 0: it's a comic book, but it's a webcomic at the same time, right?

300
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,721
Speaker 0: So one of those was freak angels, which I was reading right?

301
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,085
Speaker 0: So I just started reading that.

302
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:02,350
Speaker 0: Oh, well, it's almost done.

303
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:05,864
Speaker 0: Oh good gonna be done in like a chapter and they're gonna print the final trade.

304
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:09,221
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna be seven By the trade.

305
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:09,785
Speaker 0: then seven of them.

306
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,699
Speaker 0: But yeah, so freak angels cuz I mean it was purely.

307
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:18,430
Speaker 0: I mean, you know mechanically it was a webcomic, right?

308
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:21,670
Speaker 0: It was you know, put on the web first collected into trades.

309
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,770
Speaker 0: There were never any issues, but it was written by Warren Ellis a professional comic book writer, right?

310
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,490
Speaker 0: He was coming who comes from comic book land.

311
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:39,769
Speaker 0: so that's like saying if Alan Moore just you know started writing a webcomic and it happened to be that every page of the Webcomic was the same shape as a real normal comic book store comic.

312
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:45,724
Speaker 1: Because with a webcomic, I mean if you post just one page you have to scroll.

313
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:49,949
Speaker 1: imagine reading spider-man One page every few days.

314
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, it's it's made by someone who comes from the real quote real comic world, right?

315
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,096
Speaker 0: So anyway, freak angels is ending.

316
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:01,566
Speaker 0: So I needed some new comic to replace it.

317
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:02,610
Speaker 0: It's not done yet.

318
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,569
Speaker 0: I think freak angels might have another few chapters or whatever.

319
00:17:05,711 --> 00:17:13,869
Speaker 0: But so I needed in a comic to replace it and I found one in the same category not ogloff Not ogloff, but I probably will add ogloff.

320
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:23,944
Speaker 0: So there is a new Comic and it comes out every Monday and Thursday and it's steampunk pirates, which is really cliche.

321
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:31,578
Speaker 0: It's lady saber and Pirates of the ineffable ether spelled a e th er, right?

322
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,249
Speaker 0: So that's sort of like All right.

323
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:47,390
Speaker 0: But the person who has created this comic Oh What the hell is his name is a comic creator that I much enjoy and his name is not on the front page.

324
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:53,352
Speaker 0: Why did he not put Oh unprepared Unprepared.

325
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:54,558
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna turn this off.

326
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:55,301
Speaker 1: It's dead air.

327
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,787
Speaker 1: There's gonna be dead air Scott.

328
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:57,370
Speaker 1: Who's the author?

329
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:01,330
Speaker 0: He I fucking know his name, but like he didn't put it on his own thing.

330
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:08,693
Speaker 0: He's a. he's the guy who did whiteout and he did Gotham Central and he did Oh Greg Rucka Christ.

331
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:14,276
Speaker 0: he didn't put his fucking name on his own fucking comic moron What the hell.

332
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:19,225
Speaker 0: but anyway anyway, yeah So he wrote all those great comics that I like and bought all of.

333
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:20,430
Speaker 0: so now he's writing a webcomic.

334
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:28,070
Speaker 0: So I'm like, well even though this is cliche steampunk pirate ladies, and there's only three pages so far.

335
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,283
Speaker 0: So I don't even know if it's good or bad.

336
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:34,883
Speaker 0: yet Greg Rucka is been nothing but win in all the real comics.

337
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:37,050
Speaker 0: He's written that I have read a queen and country.

338
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,121
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

339
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:38,808
Speaker 0: queen and country.

340
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:43,324
Speaker 0: Gotham Central and whiteout are like his big winners.

341
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:44,688
Speaker 0: So I like all those.

342
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:45,250
Speaker 0: they're all great.

343
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,776
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna trust him on this one, too.

344
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:47,459
Speaker 1: Yep.

345
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:52,730
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment the next convention We will be at is of course the penny arcade expo.

364
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:05,842
Speaker 1: that you're saying is terrible and realize that you are worse as a person than whoever Made the thing that you just because you didn't make anything.

365
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:07,308
Speaker 0: So at least they made something.

00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:33,881
Speaker 1: uh October is when the New York comic-con is.

394
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:34,606
Speaker 1: we already mentioned that.

395
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:35,089
Speaker 0: oh he did.

396
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:39,250
Speaker 0: Okay I just want to add one more thing, you know, I know that we are shit talkers of the highest order.

397
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:40,477
Speaker 0: Well the second highest order.

398
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:41,844
Speaker 0: I mean we do make geek nights.

399
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:45,897
Speaker 0: Yeah But I have a new strategy.

400
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,502
Speaker 0: it is the most obvious strategy.

401
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,750
Speaker 0: it's not a new strategy it's a strategy.

402
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,392
Speaker 0: Well, it's it's.

403
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:52,159
Speaker 0: um, the fact that I'm following.

404
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:53,303
Speaker 0: the strategy is new.

405
00:21:53,403 --> 00:22:01,990
Speaker 0: This is strategy to achieve V. Yes, the strategy itself is very old and I'm like, why was I so stupid not to ever actually use this strategy?

406
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:03,810
Speaker 1: We've used it before we just forget.

407
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:08,523
Speaker 0: So now I'm gonna follow this strategy for hopefully until the end of time when I die.

408
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:10,289
Speaker 0: and that strategy is attack only one.

409
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:14,890
Speaker 1: Dude why do you keep attacking me cuz I attack only one.

410
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,170
Speaker 0: So The attack only one at this point in time is front crew calm.

411
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:27,450
Speaker 0: So I've put all other projects aside and I am attacking only major improvements to front recruit calm.

412
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,153
Speaker 0: So they will.

413
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:36,346
Speaker 0: I've already made some of them and if I could just fucking get home instead of coming over here to play Games and make podcasts every day then I could get a lot more done.

414
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:44,610
Speaker 1: But luckily Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday not doing Anything meanwhile, so you guys know well, I'll keep you know, this is the meta part of the show.

415
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:46,069
Speaker 1: So I'll keep it on my attack.

416
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:53,338
Speaker 1: Only one is now all the video content for geek nights front row crew radio free Equestria all our lectures the uncle yo stuff I recorded.

417
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:58,932
Speaker 1: I'm going to attack all the video projects that have been piling up on me Mm-hmm.

418
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:01,339
Speaker 0: That doesn't sound like attacking only one.

419
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:07,919
Speaker 1: Well one at a time in that I'm attacking that and inside of that I'm going to finish game mechanics and mechanism design.

420
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:08,701
Speaker 1: get that online.

421
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:16,840
Speaker 1: then how to win a games then uncle Yo, then radio free Equestria then all the other videos I've got Mm-hmm.

422
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:20,384
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm sure that's just riveting to all you listeners.

423
00:23:21,047 --> 00:23:30,036
Speaker 0: It is There's one more thing I want to say August August 6th 13th and 20th, huh?

424
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:31,560
Speaker 1: Three days that mean nothing to me.

425
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:40,935
Speaker 0: on those three days the New York City Department of Transportation Will be having a program known as summer streets From 7 a.m.

426
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:44,024
Speaker 0: To 1 p.m So that's a full 8 9 10 11 12 6 hours.

427
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:53,626
Speaker 0: Right on those three days Park Avenue will be closed from 70 something Street to the Brooklyn Bridge.

428
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:57,770
Speaker 1: I Want to go over there and do something.

429
00:23:58,212 --> 00:24:01,687
Speaker 0: I'm probably gonna bike all the way but that will probably take like 15 minutes.

430
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:02,350
Speaker 0: I should walk it.

431
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:05,171
Speaker 0: I'll probably do it 15 or like not 50.

432
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:08,870
Speaker 0: I'll probably do it like back and forth four times because you can go so fast cuz no one there.

433
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:17,227
Speaker 0: but they have like actually programming like you can go and like just do yoga and Exercises or you know shit and there's police everywhere, huh?

434
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:20,490
Speaker 1: I wonder See we could say oh, we'll do a meet-up.

435
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,120
Speaker 1: We'll say when we're gonna be there, but usually when you do meetups It's because we have a table and we're gonna play some board games.

436
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:26,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is gonna be moving.

437
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:27,312
Speaker 0: I'd see.

438
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,809
Speaker 0: what I'm really wondering is you know in Park Avenue is a little tunnel.

439
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,241
Speaker 0: Yep, right in front of grants.

440
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,250
Speaker 1: Can we go into the tunnel?

441
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,130
Speaker 0: Can we go in the tunnel cuz there won't be cars in there?

442
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,360
Speaker 0: I really want that to be so will it?

443
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:41,324
Speaker 0: but it thing is it's so dangerous, you know It's so dangerous to go in there under normal circumstances.

444
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:45,213
Speaker 1: I know I'm always afraid It's one of my weird like one of the few things I'm actually like.

445
00:24:45,554 --> 00:24:46,919
Speaker 0: I like if you go near that tunnel.

446
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,115
Speaker 0: it has all these signs like don't go the fuck in here unless you're A car.

447
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:53,540
Speaker 0: stay the fuck out If you're a biking.

448
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:54,729
Speaker 0: don't even go near this thing.

449
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:59,943
Speaker 1: I'm always nervous when I'm biking that I'll just like Be stupid and not pay attention and go right into one of those tunnels.

450
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:01,469
Speaker 0: the UN tunnels good of is the worst.

451
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:03,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, really don't want to go in that one one time.

452
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,937
Speaker 1: I went through that tunnel through Central Park Like that half tunnel that some like the cross.

453
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:10,121
Speaker 0: those are just overpasses.

454
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:10,623
Speaker 0: Where's there?

455
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,486
Speaker 0: a tunnel there is.

456
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:16,924
Speaker 1: there's one that's under Like it's down and it has some tunnels in it and there's really no room for.

457
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,370
Speaker 0: you don't want to go in the transverse road?

458
00:25:18,511 --> 00:25:18,994
Speaker 1: No, you don't.

459
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:19,901
Speaker 1: I was in I was on it.

460
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:21,170
Speaker 0: take you want to take the park drive.

461
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:26,070
Speaker 0: I think Emily was on a park drive - if you're on a bike you want to do park drive only no transverse road.

462
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:32,470
Speaker 1: So anyway, we talked about rent aro earlier and a long time ago on the sci-fi channel.

463
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,164
Speaker 1: You know, this is one of the things that got us into anime.

464
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:39,630
Speaker 0: I was watching, you know I'd only seen you know a few animes and I didn't really you know.

465
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,390
Speaker 0: I kind of knew like a cure was this cool anime that I hadn't seen it quite yet.

466
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, I you know, I watched Voltron when I was a kid and I sort of knew Japanese.

467
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:48,910
Speaker 0: ish, right?

468
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,290
Speaker 0: But it was sort of like yeah, but I watched the whole week on sci-fi channel of Godzilla movies.

469
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:57,930
Speaker 0: So I had gotten used to watching TV at that time slot the next week.

470
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:03,468
Speaker 0: I sit down at the same time slot on Monday and it was anime week in the same time slot and they showed.

471
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:11,210
Speaker 0: the first Night was Fatal Fury and Galaxy Express 3 9 and the second night was a do Galaxy Express 3 9 and I think something else.

472
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:16,363
Speaker 1: I don't know if it may be fatal for you, too But I know Galaxy Express 3 9 was shown and so was earth.

473
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:26,750
Speaker 1: say yet sir a to beautiful dreamer That I saw the end the very end of Galaxy Express and all I remember thinking was so what it's a train in space?

474
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, but but of all those right.

475
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:31,390
Speaker 0: so I said you like do I remember Fatal Fury fuck?

476
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,115
Speaker 0: No, right, but Galaxy Express.

477
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:34,900
Speaker 0: I fucking remember that shit, right?

478
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,448
Speaker 0: That was like the first anime that I saw.

479
00:26:37,488 --> 00:26:47,229
Speaker 1: that was like About that like that kind of thing like when I first saw vampire hundred space adventure Like what's this hardcore vampire guy?

480
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,429
Speaker 1: Like no none of the tropes of anime were known to me or the history of anime, you know.

481
00:26:52,650 --> 00:27:00,253
Speaker 1: So imagine seeing you know a Galaxy Express like it's so different from anything you'd see in America because it's so epic and melodramatic That you know.

482
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:04,168
Speaker 0: just that was the thing, you know, I saw animes before it kind of sorta.

483
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,798
Speaker 0: But that was the first anime that was like whoa.

484
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:09,908
Speaker 0: I need to see everything that is like this that exists in the world.

485
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:14,970
Speaker 1: So you Relatively recently in the last like year or two watched all of the TV show.

486
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,861
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I pretty much you know, I you know, I saw more.

487
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,410
Speaker 0: Liji Matsumoto works over the years, right?

488
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:27,010
Speaker 0: You know his properties the Yamato's and the Captain Harlock, but more recently I set him on fire.

489
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:30,409
Speaker 0: I saw every episode of the Galaxy Express 3 9 TV show.

490
00:27:30,671 --> 00:27:33,810
Speaker 0: I was every episode of the Captain Harlock TV show.

491
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:39,069
Speaker 0: I want to see all of the Queen millennia TV show, but it's really hard to get episode.

492
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:41,875
Speaker 0: At least it's hard to get all of them.

493
00:27:42,397 --> 00:27:43,540
Speaker 0: You can get quite a few of them.

494
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:46,348
Speaker 0: I saw Space Symphony meta.

495
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:50,360
Speaker 0: I saw Almost everything Arcadia of my youth.

496
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,841
Speaker 0: I saw that.

497
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:53,230
Speaker 1: I think we reviewed that on gig nights, right?

498
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,010
Speaker 0: But just recently as in within the past month, right?

499
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,395
Speaker 0: Discotech media has.

500
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:00,021
Speaker 0: finally these people are awesome.

501
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:09,190
Speaker 0: By the way, discotech is pretty much the best anime Company in the US right now, right prices good translation prices good translation subtitles high quality DVDs.

502
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,253
Speaker 0: Everything's good.

503
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:13,028
Speaker 0: You can buy it like a full season of Fist of the North Star for them for 30 bucks.

504
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:17,250
Speaker 0: They also put out awesome, you know movies like attack the gas station and shit.

505
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:30,807
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they do that one, but they you know those kinds of movies if not that one in particular All your awesome Asian cinema discotheque, so they put out Galaxy Express 3 9 and the sequel movie I do Galaxy Express 3 9 on DVD.

506
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:31,730
Speaker 0: They just both came out.

507
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,469
Speaker 0: They're like $17, but it's totally worth it.

508
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:42,130
Speaker 0: I've never seen them before in this higher resolution with this high quality and audio with the subtitles and the whole thing.

509
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:44,521
Speaker 0: It was way beautiful.

510
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:52,569
Speaker 0: Yeah for something from like 1979. so basically the deal is for those of you who are not familiar with the Galaxy Express, right?

511
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,861
Speaker 0: There is a kid who lives on earth.

512
00:28:56,022 --> 00:29:01,785
Speaker 0: earth has normal people Biological humans and they suck because they die and they're basically all poor.

513
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:05,470
Speaker 0: but meanwhile There are also robot humans, right?

514
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,270
Speaker 0: Anyone who has enough money goes and gets a machine body like Ghost in the Shell, right?

515
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,518
Speaker 0: So why wouldn't you get a machine body?

516
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:14,290
Speaker 0: machine bodies can live forever and you don't get sick or anything?

517
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,950
Speaker 1: Ah, but what is the price of immortality?

518
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:18,614
Speaker 0: I don't know.

519
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,165
Speaker 0: that may be the message and moral.

520
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:24,305
Speaker 0: that might be What the show's about the overarching points that there is.

521
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:25,188
Speaker 0: but regardless of that.

522
00:29:26,154 --> 00:29:32,884
Speaker 0: so there's a poor kid named Tetsuro, right and Hoshi no Tetsuro and he is in the TV show.

523
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:35,893
Speaker 0: He's a potato head and The movie.

524
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:40,130
Speaker 0: he has a much better character design and steady as the butt nose, but it is less funny.

525
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,417
Speaker 1: There's a butt nose instead of a potato face.

526
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:46,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, sometimes I love how the flashback in the movie is back to the potato head.

527
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:47,401
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

528
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:50,221
Speaker 0: It's like as a kid He was Phil potato head But not later.

529
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:53,982
Speaker 1: that is you know That is such a nod to the people watching the show.

530
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:55,770
Speaker 1: right that was just lost on me as a kid.

531
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,190
Speaker 0: So he was poor and walking around in the snow with his mom.

532
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,458
Speaker 1: We're trying to get to the city with his mom.

533
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:02,562
Speaker 0: right an evil count.

534
00:30:02,622 --> 00:30:04,810
Speaker 0: Mecca is basically a robot guy.

535
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:11,050
Speaker 0: I met a you know mechanical person and he hunts human biological humans for sport because he can do that sort of thing.

536
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:15,809
Speaker 0: so he freaking just blows Tetsuro's mom away with a laser right to have her mounted on his wall.

537
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:20,760
Speaker 0: and Then you know Tetsuro goes on a journey to get his revenge.

538
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:27,998
Speaker 0: and also he wants to get his own machine body because there's a Planet far away where you can get a machine body for free Even if you're poor.

539
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,289
Speaker 1: all you have to do is get there.

540
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:37,482
Speaker 0: He wants to have a long life to make up for the short life of his parents so that he wants to get to that Planet and the only way to get there is in the galaxy ray.

541
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,390
Speaker 0: I've also watched galaxy railways all of it.

542
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:40,780
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I watch that.

543
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,525
Speaker 1: It looks really fun.

544
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:41,949
Speaker 1: It's okay.

545
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:46,530
Speaker 0: So galaxy railways is basically this intergalactic train service.

546
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:53,470
Speaker 0: It's like if the MTA went everywhere in the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies and possibly other galaxies as well.

547
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:58,210
Speaker 1: Now the interesting thing is the the design of the galaxy Express is nostalgic.

548
00:30:58,491 --> 00:30:59,614
Speaker 1: It looks like an old.

549
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:04,910
Speaker 0: yeah, most of the galaxy railways trains look like fancy, you know, I guess at least bullet trains, right?

550
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,745
Speaker 0: They would be futuristic for the 70s and let's the late 70s early 80s.

551
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,250
Speaker 0: But you know, they look like bullet trains and all other fancy space trains.

552
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,910
Speaker 0: But the galaxy Express is a high-tech train that looks like an old-fashioned steam train.

553
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:26,873
Speaker 0: Right and the reason it's a special train because not only is it incredibly expensive to ride this train But it goes Express to Andromeda Which is a big deal.

554
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:43,730
Speaker 0: because you know, most of the trains just go from solar system to solar system or planets a planet You know, there's like commuter trains that go from like, you know Saturn to earth or whatever, you know, like Titan to Mars But this is a train that goes all the way to fucking Andromeda, which is another galaxy.

555
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,458
Speaker 0: You know what space there is between galaxies.

556
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:48,250
Speaker 1: about over 200 episodes worth of plan.

557
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,893
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, it's like.

558
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:53,902
Speaker 0: so people question whether or not it's an Express and in the movie It doesn't stop at that many planets.

559
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:57,170
Speaker 0: in the TV show It stops at every planet and I haven't read the manga.

560
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,103
Speaker 1: Well, how many planets are in between the stops that it just doesn't bother with?

561
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:05,637
Speaker 0: right the Express part of the galaxy Express is in between the Milky Way and Andromeda.

562
00:32:05,718 --> 00:32:07,423
Speaker 0: It doesn't stop cuz there's nowhere to stop.

563
00:32:08,084 --> 00:32:10,010
Speaker 0: That's the Express part, right?

564
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,442
Speaker 0: There's no other train that's gonna get you all the way to.

565
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:17,221
Speaker 1: and now we're not talking about the show But the show is primarily just this kind of show.

566
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:28,070
Speaker 1: where they do episodic the train lands on a planet It's there for X hours or X days Tetsuro fucks up and gets into trouble and the planet has its existential crisis right at that moment.

567
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:31,406
Speaker 0: Yep, so imagine if for you know, take for example cowboy bebop.

568
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:35,270
Speaker 0: right in cowboy bebop There's some episodic episodes and there's also plot episodes.

569
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,730
Speaker 0: But some of the non plot episodes have a little bit of plot in them like a tiny bit, right?

570
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,810
Speaker 1: Or they have like some really important character development or something or something like that, right?

571
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:46,266
Speaker 0: But there are episodes that are purely episodic.

572
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:50,390
Speaker 0: now Imagine if cowboy bebop was hundreds of episodes long like a hundred and thirty something.

573
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:57,490
Speaker 0: Well, you know Maybe ten twenty of the episodes would have some bit of plot in them and the rest would just be talking dinosaurs.

574
00:32:58,052 --> 00:32:58,774
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

575
00:32:58,835 --> 00:33:03,410
Speaker 0: So Galaxy Express the TV show a lot of the episodes are just you know, they're self-contained.

576
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,173
Speaker 0: You don't need them.

577
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:12,120
Speaker 0: The movie is a compilation that only focuses on the main plot Tetsuro getting his revenge getting to the robot planet.

578
00:33:12,883 --> 00:33:13,705
Speaker 0: What's the deal with?

579
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:14,186
Speaker 0: may tell?

580
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,530
Speaker 0: why does she want to help Tetsuro?

581
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:22,650
Speaker 0: You know what's going on in the time Castle, you know all that sort of stuff right count Mecca is a bad guy.

582
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:29,366
Speaker 0: It concentrates solely on that plot and also brings captain Harlock and emeraldus and friends into it more.

583
00:33:29,446 --> 00:33:38,590
Speaker 0: So yeah, right And it skips over a lot of the stop at a random planet and you know learn a lesson about something unrelated.

584
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:46,402
Speaker 1: There's a more, you know, it's always some sort of like existential moral dilemma What is the meaning of fighting your own way or being a beggar?

585
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:49,533
Speaker 1: or yeah, this is not listening to what mental who told you This is the.

586
00:33:49,614 --> 00:33:52,010
Speaker 0: this is the planet made of bolts, right?

587
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,330
Speaker 0: All people do on this planet is make bolts, but there's an artist living on this planet.

588
00:33:56,852 --> 00:34:02,530
Speaker 0: Oh, so woe is this artist who is forced to make bolts but wants to make art, you know on this horrible planet?

589
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't afford to leave.

590
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:10,889
Speaker 1: This is the planet where everyone's immortal, but they miss funerals So they fucking murder people so they have an excuse for funerals, right?

591
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:17,909
Speaker 0: So, yeah, there's planets like that in the TV show But the movie just concentrates on the planets that have something to do with the plot.

592
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:22,409
Speaker 1: So our review if it wasn't obvious, we're just gonna talk about the movie and we'll avoid spoilers though.

593
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:33,196
Speaker 1: Sorry, I already talked about the movie a lot Yeah But bear in mind that the movie which spoils the end of the show was aired in Japan like shown Before the series ended.

594
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:42,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not sure when the the timing of the manga release which I haven't read any of But yes, the movie was released before the TV show was done.

595
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,438
Speaker 0: So you saw the ending of the TV show in the movie.

596
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,969
Speaker 0: if you were Japanese before you saw the ending of the TV show.

597
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:51,101
Speaker 0: But they are slightly different.

598
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,770
Speaker 0: They're not exactly the same, right?

599
00:34:52,870 --> 00:35:00,590
Speaker 0: I mean, it's the same general idea with this spoiling ending that we won't actually spoil but They are quite different.

600
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:07,818
Speaker 0: So just because you've seen the whole movie and you think you know Oh, I know what's gonna happen at the end of the TV show now It's not exactly the same.

601
00:35:07,878 --> 00:35:10,250
Speaker 0: It's still worth watching the TV show if you like.

602
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:10,551
Speaker 0: Yes

603
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:21,989
Speaker 1: now in terms of the movie, this is one of those things where even if you don't like it I know people who are anime fans who have seen it and who don't like it Even though they do understand a lot of what's going on and why it's the way it is.

604
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:23,448
Speaker 1: That's fine.

605
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:33,027
Speaker 1: But much like citizen Kane if you want to have an opinion on anime and say that you care about anime You had better have seen this movie and at least know what the deal is.

606
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:43,809
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like you don't have to watch the whole TV show Right, but if you haven't seen at least this first movie not even the second one Just if you haven't seen this first movie your opinion on anime really doesn't count.

607
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:49,230
Speaker 0: It's also interesting not because it's that you know, I'm not gonna say, you know that it's the greatest movie ever.

608
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:53,426
Speaker 0: There are plenty of anime movies that are significantly better than this movie.

609
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:55,776
Speaker 0: many Miyazaki movies It's oshi khan movies.

610
00:35:56,077 --> 00:35:58,830
Speaker 0: Akira ghost in the shell does plenty of it.

611
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,310
Speaker 0: I'd even say summer wars is better than this movie.

612
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:07,584
Speaker 0: But this movie is important and it's still just because there are many anime movies better than it.

613
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:13,063
Speaker 0: It is still great though It's interesting depending on when you watch it and in what atmosphere.

614
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:14,890
Speaker 0: it could have a profound impact on you.

615
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:21,748
Speaker 0: Oh my god, when I watched it in high school, it had a profound impact much less impact now But I still very much enjoy it.

616
00:36:22,131 --> 00:36:26,668
Speaker 1: Well, I think the difference is that when I first saw it, I didn't know any of those characters were.

617
00:36:26,688 --> 00:36:27,290
Speaker 0: that's true.

618
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:37,648
Speaker 1: The whole all those like side plots and the bird and harlock and emeraldus and everything I I got the impression that I should know like kind of like when I saw the first tenchi movie.

619
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:42,690
Speaker 1: as a kid I didn't know who these people were but the movie indicated to me that I should have known like they're a big deal.

620
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:46,370
Speaker 1: So I went into that movie just thinking like oh that must be an important person.

621
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:51,990
Speaker 1: Oh, I wonder what the deal is with that and it got me really interested in the Matsumoto verse.

622
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:53,196
Speaker 1: Just cuz.

623
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:54,369
Speaker 1: I wanted to know what the deal was.

624
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:55,756
Speaker 1: Why'd that guy turn into a ship?

625
00:36:55,776 --> 00:36:57,303
Speaker 1: and what's the deal with the bird and the gun?

626
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:58,047
Speaker 1: and why is?

627
00:36:58,127 --> 00:36:58,790
Speaker 1: why is that gone?

628
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,449
Speaker 1: Like how did you get that fucking gun?

629
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, why is the gun special right?

630
00:37:03,207 --> 00:37:06,658
Speaker 1: It's like Why is everyone so sad when so-and-so died?

631
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:08,506
Speaker 0: There's even more of that in the second movie.

632
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:23,408
Speaker 0: Yeah It's weird because the first time I saw it even though I didn't know who any of those people were and I didn't even realize it Was a universe of combined things or anything like that It sort of had this, you know, really melodramatic and sort of awe-inspiring mystic quality to it.

633
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:30,472
Speaker 0: and now It's like I sort of have this, you know actual knowledge like oh, that's you know, you know Tochiro.

634
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:35,490
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, man, that's so-and-so and oh my god, but you know, he's going into the Arcadia.

635
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:41,270
Speaker 0: But it wasn't that same story told differently in you know, actually the actual captain Harlock show.

636
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:43,258
Speaker 0: So which one is the right one answer?

637
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:46,430
Speaker 0: There is no right one and there's a person doesn't go together.

638
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,942
Speaker 0: It's a bunch of jigsaw puzzle pieces that look like they fit but they don't fucking.

639
00:37:49,983 --> 00:37:56,750
Speaker 1: we didn't even get the experience of imagine if We'd seen the whole show first and then the movie and we had and we had been people who had watched.

640
00:37:57,232 --> 00:38:02,530
Speaker 0: You know, we had been Japanese people who watched Yamato and Harlock already and not just all at once like we do.

641
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:13,128
Speaker 1: But you know every week every week every week for your childhood one episode of the space train Yeah, and then there are a hundred something weeks and then way later a movie.

642
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:18,882
Speaker 1: Yep, but watching it like you said movie from my modern perspective.

643
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:22,832
Speaker 1: I Fan-service.

644
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:24,116
Speaker 1: there isn't that movie a lot.

645
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,703
Speaker 1: a lot of that movie is check it out.

646
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:27,485
Speaker 0: It's hard.

647
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:29,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, it still works.

648
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:35,890
Speaker 0: Definitely if you do not know about the Leiji Matsumoto stuff may work better if you don't know.

649
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,835
Speaker 0: I think so too.

650
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:39,610
Speaker 0: cuz like once you know it you it's or it's weird, right?

651
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,310
Speaker 0: It's like the what Marvel Comics and that often get wrong.

652
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:44,450
Speaker 0: They sometimes do it right this way, right?

653
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:47,268
Speaker 0: But they often get it wrong where they'll put stuff in like that.

654
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:51,003
Speaker 0: So therefore their comic makes no sense to people who don't know it.

655
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:52,810
Speaker 0: DC gets it wrong a lot more often, right?

656
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:59,139
Speaker 0: Yep, but in this case, it's like if you're a fan There's a whole bunch of stuff there for you.

657
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:01,790
Speaker 0: And if you're not a fan, then it's just okay.

658
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,438
Speaker 0: There's a space pirate, you know, who's?

659
00:39:03,538 --> 00:39:03,739
Speaker 0: who's?

660
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,482
Speaker 0: a great space pirate.

661
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:07,580
Speaker 0: Okay, you know, he's just some guy You don't know you don't know.

662
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:11,038
Speaker 1: real part of it too is that I was not used but it's like it's like it's.

663
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:17,881
Speaker 0: he actually sort of even worse having the inside knowledge because now I Look at it as fan service as opposed to just looking at it as it.

664
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,145
Speaker 1: there's the secondary thing of.

665
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:22,920
Speaker 1: I was not used to Leiji Matsumoto level melodrama.

666
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:25,050
Speaker 1: I had never seen anything like that before.

667
00:39:25,612 --> 00:39:34,886
Speaker 1: So the melodrama when I was a kid watching this movie late at night all alone Just made it feel probably more profound than it actually.

668
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:43,353
Speaker 0: that's why I always watch Galaxy Express late at night in the dark in the quiet because it that's when it works best because it's outer space quiet Melodrama, right.

669
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:47,150
Speaker 0: if you watch it during the daytime like when you get home from school, that's not gonna work.

670
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:51,270
Speaker 0: You know when you get home from school or whatever or work watch Macross instead.

671
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:52,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

672
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:56,633
Speaker 0: then when the lights go out before bed, that's when you watch the galaxy Matsumoto and stuff.

673
00:39:56,654 --> 00:40:01,650
Speaker 1: you just got to sit down quietly and watch it and just really let the melodrama just take you away.

674
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,774
Speaker 0: That's how I like to watch it.

675
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:13,770
Speaker 1: Anyway, I think that's probably kind of like how I wonder what the original time A particular red wine should be drunk at a particular temperature a Matsumoto should be watched in a particular time in a particular mindset.

676
00:40:14,172 --> 00:40:21,825
Speaker 0: Yeah, right because it's like if you don't give it your full attention, you know And you're really you're focusing on it and it's quiet then you're not gonna really get.

677
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:29,267
Speaker 0: you know, this, you know Extreme melodrama and you know sort of quiet space action is gonna come off.

678
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:30,289
Speaker 0: sort of cheesy, I guess.

679
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:41,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time the the actual message like the core moral structure of The Galaxy Express TV show and movie is I think extremely profound on its own.

680
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:50,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I don't know It is a strong and quality message But I think what got me about it was that it's a message that is in so many sci-fis.

681
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:53,123
Speaker 0: You know, it's a combination of me.

682
00:40:53,224 --> 00:40:57,696
Speaker 0: I'm play guy and You know token elves.

683
00:40:58,037 --> 00:40:59,340
Speaker 0: Yeah at the same time.

684
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:00,163
Speaker 0: What was us?

685
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,406
Speaker 1: Oh the non men.

686
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:06,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's like, you know, it was even when I originally saw it.

687
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,850
Speaker 0: It was a message that I had seen already in multiple sci-fi works over and over.

688
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,500
Speaker 1: But there's something about the way it's presented.

689
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:13,821
Speaker 0: Of course.

690
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:14,805
Speaker 0: So seeing it again.

691
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:20,470
Speaker 0: It was like, oh man There's that sci-fi message that I've seen in so many works that I really liked.

692
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,496
Speaker 0: I really like this one too.

693
00:41:22,576 --> 00:41:24,161
Speaker 0: In fact, it gives me this message.

694
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:27,511
Speaker 0: I've seen and heard before better than those other ones Did.

695
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:35,730
Speaker 1: well because for all the melodrama it's weird like but when I first saw the movies a kid Certain scenes felt much more profound to me than they are now.

696
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time the message was actually like.

697
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,028
Speaker 1: the core message was not presented directly in melodramatically.

698
00:41:43,048 --> 00:41:43,830
Speaker 1: throughout most of it.

699
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,157
Speaker 1: it was very subtle.

700
00:41:45,217 --> 00:42:02,767
Speaker 1: you see people who die and people who live and You realize toward the end how much more moved you are by the people who died After a long and fulfilling life achieving their goals or failing at their goals Yeah, and how the people who live forever achieved more but yet it felt more hollow.

701
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:14,282
Speaker 0: Yeah There's also the the fact, you know, you watch a lot of sci-fi things right even yeah even Matsumoto ones right and they always have lots of space battles.

702
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:16,530
Speaker 0: It's always about the space battles, especially Yamato.

703
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:24,150
Speaker 0: It's like, you know fire the wave motion cannon, but dude Right, but Galaxy Express doesn't have a lot of that.

704
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,160
Speaker 0: I mean the TV show.

705
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:28,158
Speaker 0: there's space battles But they don't go the same way.

706
00:42:28,198 --> 00:42:30,145
Speaker 0: Star Trek Star Wars or Yamato.

707
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,270
Speaker 0: space battles do right?

708
00:42:31,711 --> 00:42:42,867
Speaker 0: It's either like the train is sitting there with shields on hoping it won't get no they won't die Or someone comes on the train and has like one gun, you know, or you know, it's always.

709
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:49,890
Speaker 0: you know, sir It's it's much more Western in its its battle styling than in it than space styling, right?

710
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:54,083
Speaker 0: It's like all the action is Western action, even though it's because it's all character driven.

711
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:54,665
Speaker 0: There's no.

712
00:42:54,705 --> 00:43:01,336
Speaker 0: it's like instead of you know If they're gonna fight on the train, it'll be like a train robbery where you know Some bandits get on the train.

713
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:01,758
Speaker 1: Well, that's it.

714
00:43:01,818 --> 00:43:06,779
Speaker 1: It's all character driven that the Matsumoto verse If anything could be said to be consistent throughout.

715
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:17,130
Speaker 1: it's that a person fighting for what they believe Directly with just guts and will and determination is more powerful than any force in the universe.

716
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:24,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like a lot of the planets they go to are Western in styling and space pirates are basically also Cowboys.

717
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:28,807
Speaker 1: Well, they fight under their own flags in the sea of shining stars.

718
00:43:28,928 --> 00:43:32,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course Yeah, it's just and I mean come on gun frontier, right?

719
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:34,836
Speaker 0: It's it's basically.

720
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:38,978
Speaker 0: it's like Western in space And it's like people are like cowboy.

721
00:43:38,998 --> 00:43:41,330
Speaker 0: bebop was like Western Kung Fu movie in space like yeah.

722
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,742
Speaker 0: Well, this is from the late 70s dude and the early 80s.

723
00:43:43,863 --> 00:43:46,902
Speaker 0: So it got beat Got beat big time.

724
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:49,134
Speaker 1: I Still like the movie though.

725
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:50,179
Speaker 1: I'm glad I watched it again.

726
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:53,030
Speaker 0: I'm glad that I want to watch the second one again.

727
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:54,777
Speaker 1: I haven't seen the second one.

728
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:55,902
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

729
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:59,100
Speaker 0: The second one is something special Something special.

730
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:03,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's good But you know, but it's got stuff.

731
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:03,962
Speaker 1: Yeah stuff.

732
00:44:04,003 --> 00:44:05,429
Speaker 0: I don't know how much I want to say about it.

733
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:06,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll hold on.

734
00:44:06,415 --> 00:44:07,866
Speaker 0: I want to hold off and do another episode.

735
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:10,079
Speaker 0: Yeah Squeeze another episode out of it.

736
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,990
Speaker 1: I mean we could go on and on about it.

737
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,818
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess we could spoiler line, but there's not.

738
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:19,210
Speaker 1: there's kind of one really important reveal and that's pretty much it.

739
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:20,979
Speaker 1: And then that's it.

740
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:23,170
Speaker 1: The end is just kind of all the denim all today.

741
00:44:23,231 --> 00:44:23,997
Speaker 0: It's pretty much all.

742
00:44:24,018 --> 00:44:25,410
Speaker 0: the whole end is the spoilers.

743
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:26,395
Speaker 0: It's pretty much like this.

744
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,450
Speaker 0: You can talk about the whole show right up until the end without spoiling anything.

745
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,461
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are some slight differences in the plot.

746
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:36,534
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, usually when there's a there's a Compilation in the TV show.

747
00:44:36,835 --> 00:44:43,316
Speaker 1: Tetsuro takes a fucking gun kicks in Count Mecca's door murders him and everybody in his household like right Away in episode one.

748
00:44:43,377 --> 00:44:48,890
Speaker 1: Yep, and I remember Kinetic on way back We had that room late at night and we just had you know, we had to do something.

749
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,593
Speaker 0: So we watched it.

750
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:53,047
Speaker 1: We just watched that one episode and a crowd of people late at night.

751
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:53,710
Speaker 1: We filled the room.

752
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,177
Speaker 1: they're like 50 people sitting there and They were kind of like rowdy in the beginning.

753
00:44:58,197 --> 00:45:04,650
Speaker 1: and once the show started they were visibly moved by that scene because Tetsuro Fucking kills that guy.

754
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,675
Speaker 0: It's like in the TV show.

755
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:14,842
Speaker 0: in the very first episode in in the course of 20 minutes Count Mecca kills Tetsuro's mom and then Tetsuro goes and blows him away and all his friends right.

756
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:19,988
Speaker 1: it gets his bloody revenge burns the mansion down Yeah, and then he comes back to Mattel and he's like, alright, let's go.

757
00:45:20,893 --> 00:45:22,782
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did it so in the movie.

758
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:33,047
Speaker 0: in the TV show also There's a multi-part episode about the time palace Which is a castle where there's a fake captain Harlock who's making mischief distinct from the brain palace.

759
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:36,916
Speaker 0: exactly in The movie right?

760
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:39,966
Speaker 0: There's still a time palace because I mean that was such.

761
00:45:40,006 --> 00:45:41,090
Speaker 0: it was like a multi-part episode.

762
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,236
Speaker 0: Of course, you got to bring that in

763
00:45:42,357 --> 00:45:42,638
Speaker 1: but

764
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:54,453
Speaker 0: Count Mecca is in the time palace So Tetsuro actually has to go on the train Get to count Mecca and get his bloody revenge like halfway through the movie as opposed to at the end of the movie or at The very beginning.

765
00:45:54,594 --> 00:45:57,650
Speaker 1: count Mecca is is whiny and pathetic to the end in both.

766
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:57,898
Speaker 1: Yeah.

767
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:04,228
Speaker 0: But the other thing is most times when there's a compilation a movie a lot of times what you'll see the jerk.

768
00:46:04,248 --> 00:46:17,496
Speaker 0: the general pattern I've seen is you know, they'll take the original TV show They'll cut up they'll slice up the important parts and just squish them together and make a movie without actually and maybe the Animate a few new scenes, right?

769
00:46:17,877 --> 00:46:28,510
Speaker 0: This is actually all original animation new carat different character design for Tetsuro Much much higher quality animation than the TV show completely different music from the TV show, right?

770
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,589
Speaker 0: It's a completely original animated movie.

771
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:40,910
Speaker 0: They just happen to take the major plot points you know of a few planets from the TV show slash manga and Make those the story of the movies.

772
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:54,467
Speaker 1: So it's like they wrote the movie using pieces of the writing from the TV show and It has because it has all these like the the whole Tochiro like side plot with getting the gun and everything is a good chunk of the movie.

773
00:46:54,788 --> 00:46:55,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do.

774
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,870
Speaker 0: That's it's surprising like how much you know, cuz that is not in the TV show at all.

775
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:06,503
Speaker 0: That is in the Harlock TV show and other Matsumoto works, but they squeezed it into that Galaxy Express Movie I guess to break.

776
00:47:06,644 --> 00:47:08,493
Speaker 0: maybe that was a Intentional thing.

777
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:14,150
Speaker 1: Well, it did bring in more Harlock fan that whole thing with his mom and you know his fate.

778
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,556
Speaker 1: And yeah tochiro's mom.

779
00:47:15,576 --> 00:47:16,460
Speaker 0: There's no way tojos.

780
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,886
Speaker 0: Mom would have been alive at that.

781
00:47:18,328 --> 00:47:18,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

782
00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:19,874
Speaker 1: Well, it was.

783
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:20,838
Speaker 0: I got to just accept that.

784
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:21,461
Speaker 0: you know the thing.

785
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:21,722
Speaker 0: what does?

786
00:47:21,742 --> 00:47:23,007
Speaker 0: stuff doesn't fit Matsumoto.

787
00:47:23,027 --> 00:47:25,869
Speaker 1: stuff does fit But it only fits so much.

788
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:32,010
Speaker 1: No It fits in this like the allegory and the moral and the feel is like deadlocked.

789
00:47:33,194 --> 00:47:38,835
Speaker 0: The Canon doesn't fit at all right cuz like if you watch one set of TV shows and movies It's like there's no way.

790
00:47:39,137 --> 00:47:42,090
Speaker 0: it's like tochiro came way the fuck after Harlock.

791
00:47:42,472 --> 00:47:44,949
Speaker 0: But then you watch this and it's like no they were at the same time.

792
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:48,608
Speaker 0: Well, plus with I mean, I mean Tetsuro tochiro and Harlock were definitely the same.

793
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:54,350
Speaker 1: Yeah But look at how the message of that whole tochiro thing.

794
00:47:54,591 --> 00:48:04,123
Speaker 1: It's exactly the same message as it was in every other portrayal of ah, but it's somewhat conflicted because you know his death Serving the purpose that it serves.

795
00:48:04,545 --> 00:48:10,104
Speaker 1: but at the same time Could he not had he been longer lived with a robot body?

796
00:48:10,144 --> 00:48:13,937
Speaker 1: He could have gone hot back home to his mother And at least said something.

797
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,349
Speaker 0: also his daughter was completely absent from the movie.

798
00:48:17,093 --> 00:48:20,630
Speaker 1: But this is I think why the message feels so profound.

799
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,783
Speaker 1: You know this over this kind of generic fantasy message of if you are immortal life loses all meaning.

800
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:36,570
Speaker 1: that in the Matsumoto verse Oftentimes you see characters who really should have lived longer and how everything would have been better had they been immortal.

801
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:38,821
Speaker 0: Well, then he didn't die.

802
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:40,570
Speaker 0: He uploaded himself into his spaceship.

803
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:47,668
Speaker 0: So it's like he didn't go for the robot body until he was already gonna die Anyway, but at the same time as opposed to just a lot of people just went for the robot body.

804
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:50,899
Speaker 1: immediately You get the impression that it was not a clean like.

805
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:53,027
Speaker 1: he is not still quite the same person.

806
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:53,990
Speaker 1: He can't go back home.

807
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:55,638
Speaker 0: He's basically part of a computer.

808
00:48:55,658 --> 00:49:01,339
Speaker 1: He can't go back and say just you know Anything to his mother can't resolve that whole situation.

809
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:02,342
Speaker 0: He doesn't want to either.

810
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:03,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, but she wanted him to know.

811
00:49:03,847 --> 00:49:04,589
Speaker 0: that's you know.

812
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:10,608
Speaker 1: But in there's definitely this idea that the message is immortality bad.

813
00:49:10,628 --> 00:49:19,115
Speaker 1: yet The show is very conflicted on even that point and the movie is also somewhat conflicted on even that point Which is the main point.

814
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:23,990
Speaker 1: the point is that it's conflicted that you could you could go both ways.

815
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:30,689
Speaker 1: Yep, if I were a metal well, I don't want to spoil the end end, but I would do things differently And I wouldn't mind being immortal.

816
00:49:32,411 --> 00:49:37,650
Speaker 0: I might wait though wait for what you know for it to get the best possible robot body first.

817
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I think there are some good robot bodies one can get.

818
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:40,400
Speaker 1: yeah.

819
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,448
Speaker 0: They're also some not so good one.

820
00:49:42,508 --> 00:49:46,174
Speaker 1: Yeah So I don't know.

821
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:49,209
Speaker 1: so we can say I mean it's a fantastic movie even if you don't like it.

822
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,069
Speaker 1: It's one of the more important animated movies ever.

823
00:49:52,411 --> 00:49:55,901
Speaker 0: It's now easily available in high quality with subtitles for the first time.

824
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:56,102
Speaker 0: do

825
00:49:56,122 --> 00:50:03,676
Speaker 1: it yourself a favor and just late at night some night Just put in the DVD with a couple of friends quietly watch it Maybe while sipping some wine

826
00:50:03,756 --> 00:50:06,989
Speaker 0: and if you like it watch all the Matsumoto show if you

827
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,130
Speaker 1: like

828
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,630
Speaker 0: Matos and I hope there's a hundred and something episodes on crunchyroll.

829
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,155
Speaker 0: You can watch if you like it.

830
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,170
Speaker 1: There is so much of it that you won't know what to do with yourself.

831
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:21,309
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you do like it, I highly recommend the TV show.

832
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:25,770
Speaker 0: Some episodes are better than others, but which is what's gonna happen with 100 plus episodes?

833
00:50:25,911 --> 00:50:28,090
Speaker 0: But if you like you'll notice how it's worried.

834
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:36,057
Speaker 1: Oh head like morphs over time and it gets more and more potato with the eyes get more and more Derped until the very end.

835
00:50:36,097 --> 00:50:41,484
Speaker 1: when they under all at once because they put all their effort into the final They're like oh shit the I migrated too far.

836
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:42,269
Speaker 1: We got to put it back.
