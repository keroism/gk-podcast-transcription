1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,575
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, June 22nd 2017.

2
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:13,483
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:17,538
Speaker 1: We'll see how this goes.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,449
Speaker 1: We're talking about predicaments.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,208
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,423
Speaker 0: So work today.

7
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:28,072
Speaker 0: I go to pee like you do.

8
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:30,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you do and I go to the urinal.

9
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:32,350
Speaker 1: I feel like three times a day at work.

10
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:34,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel a lot of work as they drink too much water.

11
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,196
Speaker 1: In fact the more I'm working the more water I drink.

12
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:44,700
Speaker 0: like if I'm working hard I'm just like chugging water anyway, so You know, it's one of those urinals that has a tiny pool of water at the bottom.

13
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:55,838
Speaker 0: you know, not that not the kind with the disc or the the waterless kind like they do right and Sometimes people don't flush fully or the flusher is kind of like the flusher.

14
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:58,419
Speaker 0: on this one You have to sort of push it down really hard and hold it.

15
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:07,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you just sort of bump it once it goes like and it doesn't flush So quite often when you go in the water will be yellow, which is really not a big deal.

16
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,351
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I don't really care.

17
00:01:09,372 --> 00:01:10,620
Speaker 0: You know, it happens to everyone.

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:20,620
Speaker 0: I'm super paranoid though, like whenever I'm in a public bathroom of any kind, especially the work one I always like, you know get up before I leave the stall or walk away from the toilet.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,651
Speaker 0: I look at it to make sure it's completely flushed.

20
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:31,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, then after I wash my hands I got I almost had to double-check and Occasionally like I'll leave the stall wash my hands and someone will be in the stall now and I can't check.

21
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:34,459
Speaker 0: Oh, no, did that person just see my poop?

22
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:39,600
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'd be almost proud of it if they saw it be like, all right, you saw my mighty works.

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,047
Speaker 1: I'm just very mighty upon my work.

24
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:44,755
Speaker 0: I'm just paranoid about being and despair.

25
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:45,859
Speaker 0: I know that I don't flush.

26
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,960
Speaker 0: Oh, no Don't flush even though I'm super paranoid about flushing all the time.

27
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,204
Speaker 0: Anyway, so

28
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:58,240
Speaker 1: I watched a dude not flush and not wash his hands and walk the fuck out and he works on my floor Not in my company though some other company

29
00:01:58,626 --> 00:01:59,379
Speaker 0: Saying if he were if

30
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:01,804
Speaker 1: My company

31
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:07,260
Speaker 0: if I was a boss and someone did that I talked to him once I'd say wash your goddamn hands.

32
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:10,616
Speaker 0: I mean if I saw him do it again fired, I would do something different.

33
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,420
Speaker 0: It was not a restaurant.

34
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:12,025
Speaker 1: I would just send it.

35
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:17,033
Speaker 1: if it was a restaurant fired immediately I would just send an email to team and be like guess who doesn't fucking wash his hands.

36
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:17,976
Speaker 0: That's part of it.

37
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:18,960
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway.

38
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,214
Speaker 0: So I go and you know the waters yellow, which is a big deal.

39
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:24,857
Speaker 0: I'm gonna.

40
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,102
Speaker 0: I don't know whose water Is.

41
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:30,784
Speaker 0: let it mellow it's there I'll flush it and then I'll pee and then I'll Why flush NP?

42
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:31,789
Speaker 1: Why not pee then flush?

43
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:32,653
Speaker 1: It's not gonna get on you.

44
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:33,899
Speaker 0: I'm gonna tell you why.

45
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:39,186
Speaker 0: Obviously, it's not likely to get on me But there is the chance I can see.

46
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,230
Speaker 1: that I can see.

47
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,900
Speaker 0: well, even if it was just normal tea.

48
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,806
Speaker 1: Wait, did it get on you?

49
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,919
Speaker 0: No, okay, I flushed and then I peed.

50
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:57,426
Speaker 0: Where the story's going the color of this P now I Know eating various foods.

51
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:01,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and I've seen red pee because someone's got a problem, right?

52
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,771
Speaker 0: They can go to the hospital probably if you got red.

53
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:07,459
Speaker 1: a friend of ours who was on chemo Like her pee was basically bright pink during all of that.

54
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,244
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen.

55
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:08,565
Speaker 0: I've seen.

56
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,520
Speaker 1: I show just did an episode on what different colors of pee mean.

57
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen a blue pee even in my life, right?

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,803
Speaker 1: I peed a weird.

59
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:23,904
Speaker 1: I was on a weird antibiotic once and my pee was like Bright green to the point that I called the doctor and I was like yo and he was like, yeah Yeah, I should have warned you

60
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:27,536
Speaker 0: this P was a color I had not seen in my 35 years of life.

61
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:28,823
Speaker 1: What's the?

62
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:30,099
Speaker 1: what's the Xcode for it?

63
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,756
Speaker 0: So it was yellow and you might be saying well yellow But that's like the color piece supposed to be the least surprising pee color.

64
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:40,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, right No, it was yellow like a fucking yellow highlighter.

65
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,420
Speaker 0: I thought whoa, somebody just dropped a highlighter in there.

66
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:45,587
Speaker 0: I was like, is that even pee?

67
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,660
Speaker 0: I thought maybe it was some kind of cleaning chemical.

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe the company we're gonna talk about in the news.

69
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:54,293
Speaker 0: I thought it like maybe wasn't pee like it was a cleaning chemical or something.

70
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:56,300
Speaker 0: and and I would just like flush this away.

71
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:58,300
Speaker 0: I flush it and it's still there.

72
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,220
Speaker 0: It's probably some thing they installed in the toilet right to put this chemical in there, but no it went away.

73
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,469
Speaker 0: Someone's pee was highlighter fucking yellow.

74
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,475
Speaker 1: I'm like, maybe they ate a highlighter.

75
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:09,979
Speaker 0: I don't know what it wasn't.

76
00:04:10,723 --> 00:04:11,105
Speaker 0: I don't know.

77
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,076
Speaker 0: I don't know how it was that way.

78
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:13,820
Speaker 0: It was in a urinal.

79
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,734
Speaker 0: It wasn't like someone dropped something in a sit-down.

80
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,564
Speaker 0: What is up with that?

81
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,607

00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,252
Speaker 1: Yep, a Purple urine bag syndrome.

95
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:48,199
Speaker 0: I've never heard of that.

96
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:49,086
Speaker 0: my fuck.

97
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:53,528
Speaker 1: This is a long article some sort of off-white.

98
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,915
Speaker 0: I mean, I have clear pee a lot black.

99
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:57,500
Speaker 0: Oh god, you'd squid ink.

100
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:58,520
Speaker 0: I don't know black.

101
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,447
Speaker 1: I guess I just got if I file.

102
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:03,036
Speaker 0: if maybe your bile from your poop lines leaks into you.

103
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:07,274
Speaker 1: if I pee and it's black I literally just without calling anyone or saying a word.

104
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:08,580
Speaker 1: I just go straight to a hospital.

105
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:10,629
Speaker 0: I call 9-1-1 while I'm walking to the.

106
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,100
Speaker 1: I just go straight to a hospital and be like take a picture.

107
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,370
Speaker 1: I would go straight to the hospital and be like Deal with this.

108
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:19,928
Speaker 0: I peed black Not highlighter yellow a.

109
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,220
Speaker 1: I didn't see a highlighter yellow in there anywhere.

110
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,713
Speaker 0: Like I should have taken a picture because it was maybe that bright one there.

111
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:26,937
Speaker 0: That looks more green.

112
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:29,647
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, oh maybe though could be cool.

113
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:30,309
Speaker 1: It's the brights.

114
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,733
Speaker 1: the motion you get highlighter.

115
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:33,840
Speaker 0: yellow starts to become neon green eventually.

116
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, you go along the spectrum there, but I don't know if chemicals work.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,633
Speaker 1: I'll watch this video tonight because it's literally in my like.

118
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:40,920
Speaker 1: you have YouTube videos to watch.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I don't you know, I don't watch these immediately.

120
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:44,326
Speaker 1: Let all my subscriptions queue up.

121
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:46,213
Speaker 0: that was the most surprising thing that happened.

122
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:57,320
Speaker 1: today was seeing high letter yellow P In the office, darling, so you might have noticed that the other night two nights ago We did the show and you know I stream most of geek nights and I didn't stream that episode like a tweet in stream most episodes.

123
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,171
Speaker 1: We started streaming almost every episode because it's like real easy to do.

124
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:00,633
Speaker 1: Okay.

125
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:13,904
Speaker 1: Uh, the reason I didn't stream Is that we were trying to start the show and every time I launched audition OBS would crash Mm-hmm or hang and every time I launched OBS Audition would hang.

126
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:15,812
Speaker 0: just use X split or whatever.

127
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,399
Speaker 1: X split would also have hung.

128
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:19,290
Speaker 1: So interesting.

129
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,195
Speaker 1: I knew that.

130
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:21,823
Speaker 1: so here's the deal I learned.

131
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:25,540
Speaker 1: I like figured out exactly what's going on and it's because OBS is doing something didn't expect.

132
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:33,205
Speaker 1: So if you have for real audio hardware, like you're muxing a giant like audio interface You'll won't use MME.

133
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:34,990
Speaker 1: the windows like multimedia, whatever.

134
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:37,516
Speaker 1: MME is the thing that windows does.

135
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:38,980
Speaker 1: that for the love of God.

136
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,337
Speaker 1: Why can't Linux just do this?

137
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:48,563
Speaker 1: Where if you have like ten sound cards, which you might not think you have a lot of sound cards But in the modern era you actually have a lot of sound cards Don't realize it?

138
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:52,420
Speaker 1: every monitor that takes HDMI is a sound card technically.

139
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:56,271
Speaker 1: Yep, every headphone that you plug in with USB.

140
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:57,334
Speaker 1: That's a sound card.

141
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,400
Speaker 1: Your motherboard probably is a sound card.

142
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,855
Speaker 1: You even know about if there's like an audio jack in there.

143
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,479
Speaker 1: There might be two.

144
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,200
Speaker 1: MME just makes all those work all at the same time, but you can't record from all of them at the same time.

145
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,004
Speaker 1: There's all these issues.

146
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,893
Speaker 1: one you pick the one that you're recording bag.

147
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,920
Speaker 0: You can only play to one at the same time.

148
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:23,862
Speaker 0: Yeah Unless you install some bullshit software that's all those by default only plays to one and records to one and all the other ones are Just off.

149
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:28,080
Speaker 1: and if you do if you do if you install weird you can record from one and play on a different one.

150
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:31,900
Speaker 0: Yeah You just can't have two of them recording at the same time or two of them playing it.

151
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,718
Speaker 1: You might be able to have two different pieces of software that don't interact working with two different sound cards.

152
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:37,280
Speaker 1: that could happen.

153
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:38,224
Speaker 0: Oh, you can do that.

154
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:42,761
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can have one piece that you can have iTunes play sound on one and YouTube play sound on Another.

155
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:46,897
Speaker 1: yep, like my rig right my my streaming thing or my my headset.

156
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:48,663
Speaker 1: I have Overwatch.

157
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:53,540
Speaker 1: like audio will come in one interface to it, but the voice chat comes into another one.

158
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:01,099
Speaker 1: Like you can do the stuff like you just can't like play a song in iTunes and have it play out of like five Different speaker, but if you have pro audio equipment, I can totally do that.

159
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:03,680
Speaker 1: I can route audio all over the fuck place.

160
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,100
Speaker 0: Especially the hardware outside of your computer can do it too, right?

161
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,890
Speaker 0: So send the audio out of your computer into another device.

162
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,436
Speaker 0: that device can plug in a million.

163
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:14,170
Speaker 0: Whatever is Windows remember in the old days.

164
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,080
Speaker 1: We used to get guests on geek nights.

165
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,177
Speaker 1: I did not have the like kind of mixer that I have today.

166
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:24,800
Speaker 1: back then The way we did that is by having all these different sound cards like Skype little computer.

167
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:34,740
Speaker 1: Skype was using one sound card on one computer and like Skype - is using a different sound card on another computer And I like analog mixed all that shit together.

168
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,774
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you have for real audio hardware, you won't use MME.

169
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:41,539
Speaker 1: you use something called ASIO.

170
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:48,739
Speaker 1: Yep, if you're if you want to fuck shit up you use was API which is like bootleg ghetto windows.

171
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:50,966
Speaker 1: shit ASIO don't use it.

172
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,680
Speaker 1: Remember that time when I needed help in MATLAB to fix an episode of geek nights?

173
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:56,010
Speaker 1: That was because I was happy.

174
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,058
Speaker 1: don't use was happy ever.

175
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:14,178
Speaker 1: anyway ASIO lets you do magic But it has one very specific limitation only one piece of software can in a sense subscribe to any given specific channel of audio.

176
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:26,380
Speaker 1: So audition right now is recording the raw Output from channel one of the mixer which is me and the raw output of channel two of the mixer Which is Scott and that is independent of the faders.

177
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,605
Speaker 1: I move the faders around.

178
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:31,280
Speaker 1: that'll mess with the stream, but it won't actually mess with what's recorded.

179
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,996
Speaker 1: The recording is raw because I don't want anything.

180
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:44,984
Speaker 1: nothing I do live should affect the raw recording cuz I do everything in post kind of like how if Scott's recording video He doesn't want to like do digital zooms or effects in camera He's gonna do that shit in post.

181
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:47,754
Speaker 1: don't ruin your actual like source material.

182
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:48,357
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

183
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:54,779
Speaker 1: So I set up an advanced war stream and I happen to set it up to record a raw channel.

184
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Speaker 1: The OBS stream I do geek nights on is actually recording the main mix that is affected by the faders because it's going through the compressor.

185
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:03,388
Speaker 1: So I have a live effect.

186
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:04,619
Speaker 1: So that is also compressed.

187
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:07,433
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it'd be like the audio would be all over the place.

188
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,000
Speaker 1: It'd be hard for you to listen to in the streaming.

189
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:09,968
Speaker 1: That's why it sounds good.

190
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:19,548
Speaker 1: Ah OBS apparently if you define any audio source, even if it's not being used in X split I checked seems to do the same thing.

191
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,700
Speaker 1: So don't say like Oh exploit would fix this.

192
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:28,289
Speaker 1: Even though I was not using that like that set up I wasn't recording or anything because it was configured.

193
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,740
Speaker 1: OBS subscribes to every single audio source.

194
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,122
Speaker 1: It knows about mm-hmm.

195
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:36,808
Speaker 1: So it subscribed to a source that was also in my audition thing.

196
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:38,290
Speaker 1: So they would both hang each other.

197
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:40,324
Speaker 1: Why do they hang each other?

198
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:46,000
Speaker 1: because ASIO drivers are super finicky because they're only used in like super pro set up.

199
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,812
Speaker 0: Yeah, wouldn't you write in the code of OBS or in the code of audition?

200
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:50,820
Speaker 0: Like if cannot subscribe.

201
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:54,773
Speaker 0: Fail gracefully put up a message about not being able to subscribe.

202
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:55,375
Speaker 0: don't crash.

203
00:10:55,616 --> 00:11:02,927
Speaker 1: you'd think that You would really think that now audition will depending on how it fails.

204
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:10,088
Speaker 1: because the problem is it can actually fail in a bunch of different ways and the real problem is that The ASIO drivers are highly hardware specific.

205
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:20,460
Speaker 1: So I have specific drivers for this exact hardware and I also have specific drivers for my exact firewire and that shits all old.

206
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,545
Speaker 1: It isn't being updated that much thus.

207
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:23,448
Speaker 1: It just sort of hangs.

208
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:33,160
Speaker 1: the moral is bugs No matter how weird and obscure or difficult to troubleshoot can always be troubleshooted by using basic troubleshooting techniques.

209
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:40,100
Speaker 1: I'd looked at what was different between the last time I streamed in that time And the only thing that was different was I made it advanced for a stream.

210
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:42,230
Speaker 1: So that was how I was able to troubleshoot that.

211
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,140
Speaker 1: and now we're streaming the show again, whatever.

212
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:51,669
Speaker 1: that is also why Scott is occasionally silent in the very beginning of the show because I usually haven't muted in the main mix because I'm not using that microphone all the time.

213
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:53,260
Speaker 1: So anyway, you got some news.

214
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:55,689
Speaker 0: What was my news?

215
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,960
Speaker 0: All right, so You know, we talked about Star Wars a bunch because there's a lot more Star Wars now than there's ever been.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,831
Speaker 0: Yeah, every year we're gonna get some Star Wars.

217
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:07,280
Speaker 0: It's a Star Wars bonanza every single year.

218
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,732
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a Star Wars in one of the upcoming years.

219
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:10,757
Speaker 0: I think maybe next year, right?

220
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:18,298
Speaker 0: Because this year is this year's gonna be episode eight eight Yes, eight eight.

221
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:28,869
Speaker 1: It's weird that like until before the new Star Wars came I could immediately say exactly which number but now I got to count up Because there's so many and it's weird.

222
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:39,720
Speaker 1: Next year is gonna be Han Solo Han Solo, which because of how good rogue squadron, not rogue squadron, Rogue One was I was really looking forward to the Han Solo movie.

223
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,949
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm just I'm like young.

224
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,600
Speaker 1: Lando Calrissian just signed me the fuck up, right?

225
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:46,880
Speaker 0: I mean, I wasn't like super looking forward to it.

226
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,060
Speaker 0: It wasn't like on my hype list, but like I was definitely gonna go right to the theater and see it.

227
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, see me some Han Solo.

228
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,240
Speaker 1: I'm pretty much going to all these Star Wars movies.

229
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:57,140
Speaker 0: Give me the full-on Wookie action, right?

230
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:58,366
Speaker 0: So, you know, it was.

231
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,780
Speaker 0: it was definitely something I was gonna go do a nerdy thing.

232
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:09,939
Speaker 0: That was uh, you know gonna happen at some point, but yep Apparently it's got some drama some pretty surprising drama, right?

233
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,108
Speaker 0: Like I didn't see this coming.

234
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:15,060
Speaker 0: I'd like they were just rolling right along Disney with all these other.

235
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:16,786
Speaker 0: You know Star Wars movies.

236
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:20,920
Speaker 0: just putting them out, you know, none of them have been bad since the prequel movies, right?

237
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,880
Speaker 0: So just rolling along it seemed like everything was going great.

238
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:25,979
Speaker 0: They got tons of money and they're profiting.

239
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:29,800
Speaker 1: You didn't see a lot of like Hollywood drama coming out of the productions, right?

240
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:41,251
Speaker 0: Suddenly we get this news that over creative differences who know what creative differences there could be at a Han Solo movie between two Directors you make a badass Han Solo who goes around space.

241
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:44,300
Speaker 1: Han soloing you make it even more badass Lando Calrissian.

242
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,560
Speaker 0: Who's just there fucking shit up making you wish it was a Lando Calrissian movie.

243
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:48,986
Speaker 1: I I feel like you know what they need.

244
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:54,909
Speaker 1: and then if we make sure Shubaka gets most of the screen time I want them to make a show like far like 13 episodes.

245
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,893
Speaker 1: It's just Lando.

246
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:56,515
Speaker 1: Sure.

247
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:57,860
Speaker 0: Just call it Lando.

248
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,216
Speaker 1: That's exactly you call it Lando.

249
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:08,011
Speaker 0: Colin works every time But you The directors had some directors.

250
00:14:08,032 --> 00:14:09,940
Speaker 0: there were two of them the Lord and Chris Miller.

251
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,752
Speaker 0: I guess we're let go.

252
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:12,880
Speaker 1: they had from the movie.

253
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:16,340
Speaker 0: How could you have creative differences over a Han Solo movie and yeah.

254
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,468
Speaker 0: and then they bring in what.

255
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:27,400
Speaker 1: maybe what if the only thing I can think of is one of them is Han shot and is a stone-cold fucking killer and the other one is like Lucas style Han Solo reboot?

256
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:34,909
Speaker 0: No I get the feeling was differences but like I feel like the two of them agreed and then but the two of them Disagreed with Disney somehow why?

257
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:36,616
Speaker 1: so I have the exact quote here.

258
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:37,780
Speaker 1: I found a more recent article.

259
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,167
Speaker 0: Oh the move comes two days.

260
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:41,210
Speaker 1: So the move is.

261
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:47,880
Speaker 0: they hired a third new director Ron Howard Which is a famous person that I. I know the name of this famous person.

262
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,280
Speaker 0: I know they're a famous Hollywood person if you're only not until we did research before the show.

263
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,729
Speaker 0: Could I have told you anything about him?

264
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,379
Speaker 1: I know he's a really wood person.

265
00:14:55,941 --> 00:15:00,517
Speaker 1: What I'm curious how many of you know him as fucking Opie from the Andy Griffiths.

266
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:01,320
Speaker 0: Probably everyone.

267
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:12,750
Speaker 1: We just don't know about Hollywood, but as an aside the Andy Griffiths the show is super legit And if you've never seen it It's a. it's a really good show like.

268
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:22,479
Speaker 1: it's a really good sitcom and he played the kid But anyway, so he has been tapped to take over the direction, which is good because he's a well-known good director.

269
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:28,136
Speaker 1: fine After directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were let go from the movie so they didn't quit.

270
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,260
Speaker 1: they were fucking fired.

271
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:32,687
Speaker 1: They had spent four and a half months directing.

272
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:43,242
Speaker 1: they've already filmed a whole bunch of shit - right creative differences over style and Tone came to a head between them and a separate person Lawrence Kasdan.

273
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:48,778
Speaker 1: I have no idea who that is Disney executive who has the studio backing and screenwriter or something.

274
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:49,159
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

275
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:52,960
Speaker 1: So yeah, there's a whole bunch of follow-up drama that I don't know about.

276
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:02,420
Speaker 0: I mean the thing that you would guess would just be that one of the parties wanted sort of like a light Adventure fun time and the other person wanted a more serious badass kind of time.

277
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,268
Speaker 0: I could see that there were like a 60s Batman versus a night, you know 80s 90s back.

278
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:08,170
Speaker 0: You know what the problem is.

279
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:11,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't give a shit either.

280
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,091
Speaker 0: one of those.

281
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:19,991
Speaker 1: so both in the same movie for all I care It should be both in the same movie have a roller coaster tone Like it's silly and campy, but then hon just fucking murders a guy.

282
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:22,098
Speaker 0: That's how the original Star Wars was.

283
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:24,998
Speaker 0: It's super It's campy, but he also just fucking murders a guy.

284
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:27,820
Speaker 0: It's both at the same time and that's what it should be.

285
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,760
Speaker 0: So if they're fighting if they're having that fight, which is just a guess who knows what the fight was, right?

286
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,128
Speaker 0: If that's the fight they're having they're both wrong.

287
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't care who is gonna.

288
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:36,539
Speaker 0: here we go.

289
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:39,560
Speaker 1: Howard is considered a safe choice to complete the task.

290
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,456
Speaker 1: Sure, someone who will ably finish the movie while being a calming presence on sets.

291
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:45,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

292
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:51,520
Speaker 1: So basically the kids had a fight so they hired and a famous adult to come in and be like, alright We're gonna go buy the book.

293
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:59,680
Speaker 1: So I feel like my worry is I feel like the movie will be competent now But won't push any envelopes that it might have pushed with a more maverick team.

294
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:03,919
Speaker 0: I think it'll also be weird and that so much of the movies already been made.

295
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,400
Speaker 0: How much can they get it to you know?

296
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,260
Speaker 0: Not be awkward like having a scene that was shot with one mood trying to make a different mood.

297
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,813
Speaker 0: But then again, we have things like shining the feel-good movie trailer.

298
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:17,839
Speaker 0: So the power of editing is vast.

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,325
Speaker 0: Also, I'm sure they can do it.

300
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:24,160
Speaker 1: they got Disney movie they can just reshoot and Ron Howard has enough gravitas to be like.

301
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:25,566
Speaker 1: Nope, you're doing it this way.

302
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:27,493
Speaker 1: We're throwing out everything you film in certain.

303
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,880
Speaker 1: Oh, you could totally do whatever he wants.

304
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,067
Speaker 0: I'll make the money back.

305
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:30,550
Speaker 0: I'm sure.

306
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:41,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, they could just put Someone who looks like Han Solo on screen and have a little you know Plastic Millennium Falcon toy move back and forth and then someone makes some Chewbacca noises here.

307
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,092
Speaker 0: I would pay ten bucks to see it.

308
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,749
Speaker 1: I'm still gonna go see it day one The only things that would cause me.

309
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:48,280
Speaker 0: maybe not day one but day early.

310
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,657
Speaker 1: I'll go see it like one of the one of the earliest days week one.

311
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,991
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz day one I'm not doing midnight showings anymore.

312
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,220
Speaker 0: Definitely one of the earlier.

313
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,859
Speaker 1: I'll do like the Friday after work like the week it comes out.

314
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it depends if it's a Christmas one or a different part of the May 25th, I think yeah I'll just go see it like the week of.

315
00:18:04,644 --> 00:18:07,955
Speaker 1: yeah, but I will not go see it right away.

316
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:14,482
Speaker 1: if Ron Howard also quits Cuz that means shit went down It's.

317
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:16,333
Speaker 0: I guess that's just the biggest nerd news there is.

318
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:17,419
Speaker 1: or if Lando isn't in it.

319
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,971
Speaker 0: So we had to say something about if Lando or Chewbacca in it.

320
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:21,713
Speaker 0: They're in it.

321
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:25,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, so unless Ron Howard gets fired I feel like we're just still gonna go see this.

322
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:28,660
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't we we'd go see it even if everyone was fired and they started over.

323
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:40,676
Speaker 1: Yeah So there's a news here and I didn't see this picture until someone sent it to me in a in a chat where we talked About all the scary politics that would scare a lot of you if we talked about it on Twitter.

324
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:43,864
Speaker 1: So anyway I'm looking at the picture right now.

325
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:45,570
Speaker 1: So if you're watching the live stream, you can see it.

326
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:53,389
Speaker 1: This picture is actually like Super super fucking terrifying if you know what it's a picture of.

327
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,260
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm because it is a picture of four cylinders of plutonium.

328
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,508
Speaker 0: Plutonium just looks like metal by the way.

329
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:01,176
Speaker 1: Plutonium is a metal unless you like.

330
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:01,920
Speaker 1: there are salts of it.

331
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,507
Speaker 1: There are chemicals of its radioactive.

332
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:06,139
Speaker 0: So it goes away slowly, but it's not that fast.

333
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:14,320
Speaker 1: It's not like it just disappears while you're looking at it, but not to get too deep into How that what the scary thing about this picture is.

334
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:28,527
Speaker 1: But if you really want to know because I know nuclear weapons and nuclear stuff is kind of a slightly more scary thing Today than it might have been say before the election last year Not a lot of big scary thing but like one step

335
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:35,244
Speaker 0: scary scares people more than it should because of history and also Science fiction.

336
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:46,302
Speaker 1: Yeah books and movies and but if you want to know why this is scary Google for the Wikipedia article or the Wikipedia page about something called the demon core because basically there's a concept of Criticality.

337
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:54,868
Speaker 1: if you have a nuclear material like plutonium or enriched uranium and you have too much of it in a small enough space Yeah, it's radioactive, but it's not gonna nuke.

338
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:56,394
Speaker 1: It's just radioactive.

339
00:19:56,434 --> 00:20:00,565
Speaker 1: Like it's not great to hang out around it No, but it's just radioactive.

340
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:04,032
Speaker 0: right if you put too much bananas radioactive.

341
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:05,977
Speaker 0: It's like sitting in a banana warehouse.

342
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:11,476
Speaker 1: Yeah The Yiga clan yes, maybe that's why they're all weird.

343
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:25,520
Speaker 1: Yes But if you put too much of this material in a in the wrong shape too close to itself There is a critical mass of the components like of this element and fission occurs.

344
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,160
Speaker 1: Yes, such that fission occurs and fission occurs in less than a second less than a millisecond.

345
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:35,620
Speaker 1: So you'll have a material that is not great to hang around but totally okay.

346
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:41,600
Speaker 0: Like you can stand there and be fine You can wear like a lead armor or have a shield like between you and it or whatever.

347
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:46,063
Speaker 1: but the terrifying thing is that these are sitting here and they're Cylinders.

348
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:56,040
Speaker 1: if someone bumped to this table and this one in the middle Rolled a little bit to the left and touch this other one you would get what is called a criticality excursion.

349
00:20:56,522 --> 00:21:01,220
Speaker 1: That means that in a flash in a fraction of a second everyone standing there would be dead.

350
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:06,066
Speaker 1: Every single person in that room is Is it is already dead?

351
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:11,680
Speaker 1: They will actually die in a week or two, but there is no radiation poisoning.

352
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:13,064
Speaker 1: Yes, they are dead.

353
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,816
Speaker 0: Even if they're wearing all sorts of nice anti radioactive armors and shields.

354
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,000
Speaker 0: It's too much radiation.

355
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:18,541
Speaker 0: They're dead.

356
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:27,055
Speaker 1: whoever took this picture is very lucky to be alive and should never be anywhere near nuclear material again ever.

357
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:32,371
Speaker 0: And Why not take a picture of just one plutonium?

358
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:34,939
Speaker 0: Why do you have to take a picture of four plutonium's?

359
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,204
Speaker 0: Why not just one?

360
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,752
Speaker 0: the picture of one isn't good enough.

361
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:39,359
Speaker 1: Did you did you not know?

362
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,930
Speaker 1: Like did you just not like how?

363
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:43,760
Speaker 0: and you you're a photographer?

364
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,400
Speaker 0: You don't anything about your excuse for knowing anything about radiation, right?

365
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,640
Speaker 0: But you're in a place where they're keeping plutonium's where the most expert people are.

366
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:02,460
Speaker 1: Shouldn't they not give you yes Oh Scott the demon core the reason I'd linked it I'm talking about that is because a lot of the times this happened probably the most pain.

367
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,252
Speaker 1: There's one core that killed a bunch of people.

368
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:08,387
Speaker 1: We eventually used it in a nuke Mm-hmm, I think they use it.

369
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,920
Speaker 1: But anyway, one of the testing ones an island somewhere Uh, so not on an island on land.

370
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:18,300
Speaker 1: But the way this killed some people was that they had it the two halves of it.

371
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:25,724
Speaker 1: They were like holding them together and they were holding them apart with a flathead screwdriver that they were just holding in the middle to Keep them from touching.

372
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:27,271
Speaker 0: So they're like too close.

373
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,462
Speaker 1: It's like a Pac Man, but it's fine That's.

374
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:30,629
Speaker 1: how does the tolerance are?

375
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,687
Speaker 1: it's like a Pac Man, but they have a screwdriver Just holding the two apart while they're fucking with it.

376
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:37,817
Speaker 1: Someone slips someone slipped and the screwdriver fell out dead.

377
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:38,579
Speaker 1: That was the end.

378
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:43,720
Speaker 1: Yep, those people knew more about nuclear material than most people on earth do today.

379
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:48,020
Speaker 1: Then these were the experts of the world and they were fucking holding them with a screwdriver.

380
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:55,605
Speaker 0: Why not make some sort of like mold that you put them in so that they're like a little wall, but you know Yeah, so it's gone.

381
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,534
Speaker 1: So the way they have people actually work with this stuff.

382
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:58,900
Speaker 1: They do have controls like that.

383
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:08,408
Speaker 1: Someone just went and got all this shit and put it out on a table and said hey look And the story is all these safety lapses.

384
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:12,260
Speaker 1: Los Alamos appears to be a shit show of nuclear safety today.

385
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,069
Speaker 0: You think that's like the number one place?

386
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,572
Speaker 0: Shouldn't it be?

387
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:16,100
Speaker 1: it probably is the number one place.

388
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,506
Speaker 0: It'd be the least shit show.

389
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:25,873
Speaker 1: nuclear weapons are terrifying and the reality is that the u.s Actually critically under funds and under like trains the people who do this stuff.

390
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:27,938
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and you can.

391
00:23:28,078 --> 00:23:29,686
Speaker 1: we're not news We're just commentary.

392
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:30,713
Speaker 1: you can read these.

393
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,886
Speaker 1: if you're scared of this stuff Don't read these articles.

394
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:35,180
Speaker 1: if you're interested in it read these articles.

395
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:41,566
Speaker 1: But mostly I just want an excuse to talk about this picture because just loves talking about anything nucleated Holy shit, though this picture.

396
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:44,579
Speaker 1: like I I cannot get over this.

397
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:46,645
Speaker 0: Well, they're not screwdriver closed.

398
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:48,109
Speaker 0: They're like screwdrivers apart.

399
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:49,914
Speaker 1: So that nobody died.

400
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:52,000
Speaker 1: Nobody sneezed and bumped the table, I guess.

401
00:23:53,462 --> 00:24:00,675
Speaker 1: And I guess the only other news we'll talk about before we get into the predicament Is that we try not to talk about politics too deeply on the show.

402
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:11,390
Speaker 1: I'm a politics now so the Republican Party in the US actually released the text of their health care bill and It is a monstrous like literal murder bill.

403
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,020
Speaker 1: like it would literally ruin health care in America.

404
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,359
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna get into it.

405
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:24,706
Speaker 1: All I'm gonna say is that if you live in America and you live in a state that has even one Republican senator Call them and swear at like.

406
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:27,719
Speaker 1: call them and scream at them like call them and scare them.

407
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:31,634
Speaker 1: I like I live in a state where there's no one I can call.

408
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:33,119
Speaker 1: There's nothing I can do about this.

409
00:24:33,744 --> 00:24:36,422
Speaker 0: My representatives are the best representatives like there's no.

410
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,007
Speaker 0: what like you couldn't if I get someone?

411
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:43,945
Speaker 1: my senators said that she like both my senators said that they will try to Grind the Senate to a halt to stop.

412
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:54,320
Speaker 0: I don't even have the kind of Democrats representing me that are like the centrist kind Like they're all the lefty guy and that like I'm like, oh run for no cuz I don't want to replace this person.

413
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:55,023
Speaker 1: I called my.

414
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:56,188
Speaker 1: I don't want to move.

415
00:24:56,368 --> 00:25:00,300
Speaker 1: I called my state senator about a single pair and they were like, dude I fucking signed it.

416
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,142
Speaker 1: I'm a sponsor.

417
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:06,297
Speaker 0: my guy is like whenever there's a news like so-and-so in New York pushing for whatever.

418
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:07,220
Speaker 0: It's always my guy.

419
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,809
Speaker 0: Well, I guess he's doing all.

420
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,500
Speaker 0: I'm only bringing this up better at it than me.

421
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:16,068
Speaker 1: There's a lot of you out there Like we have a. really we have a decent number of fans.

422
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:20,036
Speaker 1: if you just happen to live in a state that has a Republican Center move.

423
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:28,405
Speaker 1: Well, yeah move but before you move call them like as I call them every once a day and swear at them Like I'm not even joking.

424
00:25:28,786 --> 00:25:33,060
Speaker 1: You've got to make them scared that people in their state might actually do something.

425
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:34,549
Speaker 1: That's all.

426
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:35,198
Speaker 0: they don't give a shit.

427
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:40,220
Speaker 0: They might because the only thing they only share the rich people column.

428
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,805
Speaker 0: No, they're scared.

429
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:46,100
Speaker 1: or if the people who actually vote get actually somehow angry which rarely happens.

430
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:48,404
Speaker 1: Thank you, man.

431
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:49,027
Speaker 1: I get mad.

432
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:50,714
Speaker 0: Don't get mad.

433
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:52,020
Speaker 0: No one's getting mad red circus.

434
00:25:57,025 --> 00:25:59,097
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

435
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:11,587
Speaker 0: what he got Right, so a long time ago I did a thing of the day where this guy goes to like the dollar store and buys like the most garbage like $1.00 kitchen knife.

436
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:21,550
Speaker 0: right but is an expert at knife sharpening Which means he actually knows how to use a whetstone which you know, I also sort of know the theory But I don't have the practice.

437
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:22,033
Speaker 1: I'm not good.

438
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:23,080
Speaker 1: I'm not even that good at home.

439
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,231
Speaker 0: I've never actually done it right but I try to hone stuff and I'm not like I Feel like I should buy like $3.

440
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:29,500
Speaker 0: if I really wanted to get into it.

441
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,053
Speaker 0: I should buy like three $1 knives and the stones.

442
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:34,064
Speaker 0: but it's like I already do enough shit But I just pay.

443
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:35,713
Speaker 0: so paying someone to sharpen knives.

444
00:26:35,754 --> 00:26:36,840
Speaker 0: They charge like a few dollars.

445
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:40,520
Speaker 0: It's not worth it to do it yourself unless you're way into it or you do it a lot.

446
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,250
Speaker 0: Anyway, but so that guy sharpened that $1 knife to.

447
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,113
Speaker 0: it was crazy sharp.

448
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,338
Speaker 0: He was cutting paper and stuff.

449
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:45,840
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

450
00:26:45,941 --> 00:26:47,618
Speaker 0: Right, he's back at it again.

451
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:50,280
Speaker 1: He back at it again in the Krispy Kreme.

452
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,449
Speaker 0: He was in some kind of.

453
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:52,820
Speaker 0: he tells the story in the video.

454
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,270
Speaker 0: But he was at some kind of store.

455
00:26:54,653 --> 00:27:02,331
Speaker 0: and some poor guy Comes in trying to sell this old rusty knife to the store and the store was like no We're not even to give you like 30 cents for that.

456
00:27:03,116 --> 00:27:03,940
Speaker 0: I guess it was in yen.

457
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,105
Speaker 0: So convert whatever.

458
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:08,337
Speaker 0: but then he goes to the guy and he's like, oh, I'll buy that from you.

459
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,788
Speaker 0: and the guy's like Oh, really three dollars.

460
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:15,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he's like fine You know paid three dollars, right?

461
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:24,946
Speaker 0: But this knife while it starts out all rusty is actually a hella nice fucking knife and he sharpens and shines that shit Like oh baby, this is so good.

462
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:33,707
Speaker 0: I just love seeing people restore a busted thing to Being awesome thing Again, it's just so.

463
00:27:33,747 --> 00:27:37,279
Speaker 0: if only we could do that with like busted old subway.

464
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,663
Speaker 0: Yeah Right.

465
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:40,194
Speaker 0: We should get this guy working on the subway.

466
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:44,089
Speaker 0: Yeah Take his whetstone onto the rails and clean.

467
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,517
Speaker 1: So I got two things today, but they're deeply related.

468
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:57,317
Speaker 1: So You know in like old cartoons when Wile E. Coyote has like some dynamite that he's gonna blow up He has a big box with a tea stick on it and you push the tea down little plunger.

469
00:27:57,338 --> 00:28:01,382
Speaker 1: Yep So this is big lives of YouTube channel I follow anybody.

470
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:13,856
Speaker 1: usually he takes dodgy Chinese electronics and takes it apart and explains exactly how it'll kill you but in this case he Explains in extreme detail how those old dynamite explode.

471
00:28:13,896 --> 00:28:14,759
Speaker 1: his work is back then.

472
00:28:15,341 --> 00:28:24,595
Speaker 1: Batteries did not have enough power if they even existed in a lot of places or enough reliability to be used for this And there wasn't like power like you couldn't plug in anything.

473
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:25,600
Speaker 1: This is like Wild West times.

474
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:31,980
Speaker 1: So he explains in extreme detail how those old dynamite blasters worked.

475
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:37,765
Speaker 1: And then in case you're wondering how they do it today It's not that different.

476
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:43,408
Speaker 1: and there's another video he has that shows a modern Abra dynamite Exploder and apparently in the industry.

477
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:44,674
Speaker 1: I didn't know a lot about these things.

478
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:47,529
Speaker 1: They're just called Dynamite exploders.

479
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:53,954
Speaker 1: modern ones don't have plungers Nope They have cranks and buttons and they do not take power and they do not have batteries.

480
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:59,700
Speaker 1: and they work almost the same way Just with more safety, I guess dynamite does not require power to explode.

481
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:04,040
Speaker 1: It requires very little the blasting caps, but essentially this is videos fascinating.

482
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:16,200
Speaker 1: the first one is okay because you learn how this old technology works, but this dynamite exploder is cool because it seems very retro and like very minimalist and simple and almost weirdly archaic.

483
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:24,220
Speaker 1: and Yet this is how it's done today Because these old systems and these old methods are hyper reliable.

484
00:29:24,802 --> 00:29:26,168
Speaker 1: They have no requirements.

485
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:27,152
Speaker 1: They don't need batteries.

486
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,377
Speaker 1: They don't need power.

487
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:29,160
Speaker 1: They need dynamite.

488
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:30,823
Speaker 1: They yeah you need dynamite.

489
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:38,326
Speaker 1: if you got dynamite you need the wires to connect to the dynamite and you got some wires and you got a Dynamite exploder and you got blasting caps.

490
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:39,931
Speaker 1: you can make dynamite explode.

491
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:41,535
Speaker 0: you need things.

492
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:43,822
Speaker 1: how this thing works is Fascinating.

493
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:56,760
Speaker 1: how durable this thing is is ridiculous and I had to look up what a thyristor has to be able to you know Not get destroyed if the dynamite it also has to work in a mine and mines are not the most comfortable places.

494
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, the big rock falls on it.

495
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,000
Speaker 0: It still needs to work and also not accidentally blow up all the dynamite if a rock falls on it.

496
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:06,279
Speaker 1: And also you'll learn what a thyristor is which I literally had to look up because I did not know.

497
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,930
Speaker 1: In the moment the booklet book is Frank Herbert's do I read a whole bunch.

498
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,973
Speaker 0: I finished the.

499
00:30:12,374 --> 00:30:12,655
Speaker 0: the first.

500
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:16,708
Speaker 0: we're reading Dune book one Yeah, which actually has like it has like.

501
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:24,474
Speaker 0: each chapter isn't that long but there's like three sort of Parts, so it's like book one book two and book three are all in that first volume.

502
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:26,500
Speaker 0: So I finished the first one.

503
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,460
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm doing the second one now I'm gonna read the whole thing because I'm going to London next week.

504
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,165
Speaker 1: So I'm pretty much gonna read the whole thing on my trip.

505
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:35,235
Speaker 0: It's bait that board game is so accurate.

506
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:37,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's ridiculous.

507
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:40,339
Speaker 0: I didn't realize how accurate that board game was.

508
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:43,719
Speaker 0: They literally turned the book directly into that board game.

509
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:52,602
Speaker 1: It's kind of amazing that you can have an IP in a game that so closely matches the source material in both theme and Substance.

510
00:30:52,762 --> 00:30:53,144
Speaker 0: it's great.

511
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:57,600
Speaker 0: And like the the final thing that is in the game that wasn't in the book yet just happened.

512
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,055
Speaker 0: It was a nexus in the book just now.

513
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:03,964
Speaker 1: No Also this weekend Emily will be there.

514
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:05,290
Speaker 1: a bunch of our friends will be there.

515
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,320
Speaker 1: a bunch of our friends are speaking there.

516
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,063
Speaker 0: I might go there.

517
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:14,204
Speaker 1: Joe foo, you might you know, uh, the visual novels like the people I work with outside Before.

518
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:16,169
Speaker 1: yeah, Joe foo is gonna be giving a talk.

519
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:18,355
Speaker 1: So is cat small who is fucking amazing.

520
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,197
Speaker 0: She's running the thing.

521
00:31:19,237 --> 00:31:19,498
Speaker 1: Yeah.

522
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:25,454
Speaker 1: Yeah and Game devs of color Expo is Saturday in New York City in Harlem.

Speaker 0: It's $20.

525
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:31,900
Speaker 0: It's $20 a day of gaming talks like serious game.

526
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,969
Speaker 0: Are you gonna get a bargain like that ever?

527
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,933
Speaker 1: and if you're poor like you can't afford 20 bucks They'll help you out to like seriously.

528
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:40,120
Speaker 1: go to their website and check them out.

529
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,122
Speaker 0: I'm sure you sure anyone who can listen to a podcast has $20.

530
00:31:44,122 --> 00:31:51,787
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you if you don't for whatever reason they pointedly have will help you get into this thing Mmm, and this is gonna be pretty cool.

531
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:54,739
Speaker 1: Also, it's coming up in a few weeks Kinetic.

532
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:03,932
Speaker 1: on Kinetic on 15 is July 7 through 9. the website says 6 through 9 But on the 6th, all you can do is pick up your badges.

533
00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:05,720
Speaker 0: We still run the panels department there.

534
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:14,200
Speaker 1: I guess I scheduled I guess Scott's in charge of like all our like day of logistics and operations in the panels department.

535
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:16,069
Speaker 0: It's we don't have a lot of staff this year.

536
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,260
Speaker 0: So I'm just scheduling everyone for the whole con.

537
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:26,976
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm gonna let everyone punch in at the beginning and punch out at the end to Ease difficulty or worrying about shifts, but people just take breaks whenever.

538
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:31,620
Speaker 1: but seriously Like don't fly to Connecticut to go to Connecticut.

539
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:41,438
Speaker 0: But if you live within like a couple hour drive if you can drive today Kinetic on or take some other kind of transportation to Hartford easily it is worth going to.

540
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:45,952
Speaker 0: I don't know It's worth paying for it depends, but it's definitely worth going to.

541
00:32:46,012 --> 00:32:55,499
Speaker 0: if you're a nerd who cares about anime Yeah, or gaming or any other kind of game doing its tabletop area is better than most tabletop cons like straight up.

542
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:59,296
Speaker 1: And it's that that departments run by people kind of like how we run panels.

543
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:02,249
Speaker 0: the same deal Even if you just want to have like one.

544
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:02,992
Speaker 0: it's really good.

545
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:23,633
Speaker 0: if you just want like one day of nerdery Right, just go and you know, check out the guest list Maybe the someone your way into because basically where other cons will have like a few top-tier people's Kinetic on you tends to get a ton of mid-tier people's right like people are on TV and people who write books like people you care about but like you might not know that you care about them.

546
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:27,728
Speaker 0: until you look at the list of guests you're Whoa, I actually sort of want to.

547
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,557
Speaker 0: oh man, wouldn't it be cool to see all these people?

548
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:30,080
Speaker 0: and that is.

549
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:32,246
Speaker 1: So we'll be doing some shows here.

550
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:35,300
Speaker 1: We're doing like four panels and I guess I'm hosting the opening ceremony.

551
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,430
Speaker 1: We'll find out how that all goes.

552
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,306
Speaker 0: I Did not volunteer for that.

553
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:43,640
Speaker 0: I was like, yeah, let's have uncle yo do it and otherwise subscribe to our stuff.

554
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,476
Speaker 1: You know YouTube and all that and I think it's time for the predicament because I didn't have a good idea for show.

555
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:50,363
Speaker 1: I Got the demon coral.

556
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,870
Speaker 1: Let me move that out of the way.

557
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,126
Speaker 1: I Did too.

558
00:33:55,186 --> 00:33:56,736
Speaker 1: they I think he might also do half of it.

559
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:59,119
Speaker 1: I'm not sure I haven't really looked into that so much.

560
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:02,815
Speaker 1: So, uh, I asked our patreon patrons because we talked.

561
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:07,916
Speaker 1: I think we streamed it But we didn't record it in the show about this like predicament that I guess people on reddit.

562
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:08,639
Speaker 1: We're talking about.

563
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:12,614
Speaker 1: Okay, and the idea was like so you're in outer Brooklyn.

564
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:13,295
Speaker 0: No.

565
00:34:13,335 --> 00:34:14,340
Speaker 0: No you live in Brooklyn.

566
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,487
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're in Manhattan like at work or something or out on the street and you poop your pants.

567
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:20,710
Speaker 0: What do you do?

568
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,353
Speaker 0: and People are bit.

569
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:24,223
Speaker 0: Well, it's like the answer was pretty much.

570
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:25,530
Speaker 0: Well, you pooped your pants.

571
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,005
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be good right no matter what happened.

572
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:28,489
Speaker 1: What do you do?

573
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,192
Speaker 0: What do you do?

574
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:33,030
Speaker 0: is you go buy new pants you go find a Starbucks bathroom, whatever you throw your pants?

575
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:38,909
Speaker 1: Oh, so I have a very specific go commando whatever start with that one because this is you know, this is very similar to the like.

576
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:41,245
Speaker 1: How many five-year-olds could you fight off?

577
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,030
Speaker 1: kind of question?

578
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,558
Speaker 1: But the difference is these are more.

579
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:46,889
Speaker 1: at least this was more like a very specific practical thing.

580
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:50,870
Speaker 1: So I thought so I thought very specifically what I would do just in case you know good happen.

581
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:56,889
Speaker 1: What I would first do is go to the nearest Starbucks and assess the damage in that bathroom.

582
00:34:57,577 --> 00:34:58,083
Speaker 1: I just get right.

583
00:34:58,103 --> 00:35:05,480
Speaker 1: in that bathroom I would sacrifice my underwear because I'm assuming they're a lost cause Mm-hmm, and I would clean myself up as best I could.

584
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:13,170
Speaker 1: I would actually wash the inside of the pants in the sink as best I could and then I would go out to the nearest clothing store of any kind.

585
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:17,490
Speaker 1: Buy pants buy underwear because you can buy underwear like every drugstore.

586
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:23,167
Speaker 1: Go back to a different Starbucks because by then people might remember I was the guy who left a bunch of.

587
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:24,786
Speaker 1: left a poop smell in the sink.

588
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:31,670
Speaker 1: Wash myself again change everything throw the old pants away, and then I would take the subway home.

589
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,030
Speaker 0: Just go home and then you know and never speak of it again.

590
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:37,215
Speaker 0: Set your life.

591
00:35:37,777 --> 00:36:01,968
Speaker 1: I did have a situation in Australia where I Didn't poop my pants But I almost did cuz I ate some Mexican food in Manly and that Mexican food fucked me up real bad, and I was on a long hike in the woods so I pooped I cleaned up with the boxers I Buried them, and I never spoke of it again.

592
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:04,219
Speaker 1: And that is what I did at manly.

593
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,745
Speaker 1: so if you ever dig a hole somewhere in the woods in manly You might find my poopy boxers one time.

594
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:13,550
Speaker 0: I was biking Down in like by the Obobo bridge.

595
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,143
Speaker 0: Yes, I mean it was down there.

596
00:36:16,163 --> 00:36:26,377
Speaker 0: right I was in a woods but and I had to poop real bad, so I went into the woods a bit and I squatted and I pooped and Just after I got a

597
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:27,803
Speaker 1: hope for the clean delivery

598
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:33,941
Speaker 0: just after I finished pooping And I started to walk away some people were approaching and I ran.

599
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:39,278
Speaker 0: yeah, but I'm pretty sure they saw that poop Because it was.

600
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:43,259
Speaker 0: it was like it was like a pile But this is not the poop emoji.

601
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,650
Speaker 1: so 11 patrons gave us predicaments.

602
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:48,529
Speaker 1: I skimmed him But I did not read them in detail.

603
00:36:48,992 --> 00:36:52,067
Speaker 1: We'll blow through as many of these as we feel like and we'll see how this goes.

604
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:54,458
Speaker 1: yeah I don't know how realistic these are.

605
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,613
Speaker 1: I only read one just to kind of make sure they were Plausible.

606
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,242
Speaker 1: there was a pretty good one about a ride at a hot.

607
00:36:59,262 --> 00:37:03,162
Speaker 1: you didn't scream this content But if they're bad, we'll read them out loud and shame the person.

608
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:04,730
Speaker 0: well you can edit the show to move.

609
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:05,996
Speaker 1: I'm not editing that.

610
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:07,302
Speaker 1: so the first one.

611
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:08,105
Speaker 1: I'll just go in order.

612
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,295
Speaker 1: uh Is unattributed?

613
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:11,319
Speaker 1: I'll just read it.

614
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,969
Speaker 1: the both of you are trying to find a place to eat at PAX.

615
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:16,335
Speaker 1: Okay, not determine the location.

616
00:37:16,716 --> 00:37:21,370
Speaker 1: you split off from your normal party, and you go down a street with a very distinct fog.

617
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:30,450
Speaker 1: Alright, okay, as you emerge on the other side of the fog you hear a faint Foghorn and you look around only to notice that all the traffic is no longer on the road.

618
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:34,030
Speaker 1: Your cell phones GPS doesn't find our location and every building is boarded.

619
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:37,089
Speaker 1: Okay, so obviously we're in Silent Hill now, okay?

620
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:41,969
Speaker 1: Looking back the way you came you see a cliff face with signs the state not to climb down.

621
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:43,919
Speaker 1: So I guess there's a cliff there.

622
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:48,882
Speaker 1: ahead of you is more fog But you can vaguely catch the outline of a person like objects.

623
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:50,890
Speaker 1: well to your side you see two alleyways.

624
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,481
Speaker 1: You're unable to determine where they ultimately end.

625
00:37:53,501 --> 00:37:55,430
Speaker 1: How do you get out of this situation?

626
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:59,745
Speaker 0: I mean if I'm trapped in some haunted fantasy world it's gonna be pretty dangerous.

627
00:37:59,786 --> 00:38:00,850
Speaker 0: I'm probably gonna die anyway.

628
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:01,794
Speaker 1: There's all.

629
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:05,189
Speaker 0: I don't believe in that bullshit, so I just go to the person and be like yo where we at.

630
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,194
Speaker 1: no No, see you back up.

631
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:07,018
Speaker 1: There's there's.

632
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,170
Speaker 1: there's a very small list of potential situation.

633
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:14,290
Speaker 0: I could also be hallucinating which is even more likely so I should just sit down and take a nap in order.

634
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:15,998
Speaker 1: I think here's the most likely scenarios.

635
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:16,963
Speaker 1: It's number one.

636
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:19,552
Speaker 1: I am dreaming Also good.

637
00:38:19,572 --> 00:38:24,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, so my first goal just to figure out if I am dreaming or not jump down the cliff.

638
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:26,400
Speaker 1: No, don't jump down the cliff because what is?

639
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,044
Speaker 0: you're not dreaming?

640
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:27,910
Speaker 0: pinch yourself.

641
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:31,090
Speaker 1: So I actually I just hope because I like the lucid dream.

642
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,258
Speaker 1: I actually have a very specific process in my life.

643
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:44,269
Speaker 1: if I ever end up in a situation that seems strange I look at my hands, and that's a trigger And then I just think can I trace back all the steps that led me to where I am now?

644
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,923
Speaker 1: Because if I can't it's almost definitely a dream because dreams.

645
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:59,947
Speaker 1: you're like in your grandma's house But there's a weird door and now you're in New York, and then you're flying like it doesn't make sense But in real life stuff makes sense if I can't determine that I'm dreaming like if it all makes sense.

646
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:02,390
Speaker 1: number two I am hallucinating.

647
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:10,670
Speaker 1: In which case try to do as little as possible because I don't know what my meat body is doing out in the non hallucinating world.

648
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:13,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, sit down to where I sit down and wait.

649
00:39:14,712 --> 00:39:20,921
Speaker 1: If Scott's next to me, I ask him if he's seeing the same shit as I am Because maybe he said you're all alone now you got separate.

650
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:24,677
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, if we get completely separated Yeah, but if like Scott and I are together.

651
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,926
Speaker 1: I'm like Scott am I hallucinating?

652
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:28,050
Speaker 1: Are you hallucinating?

653
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:32,190
Speaker 1: Did someone spike our water at the panel and we're both on LSD?

654
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,996
Speaker 1: Scenario number three next most likely.

655
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:39,590
Speaker 1: This is a crazy elaborate prank like Japanese game show style.

656
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:44,750
Speaker 1: And fourth most likely magic is real, and this is magic nonsense.

657
00:39:45,732 --> 00:39:49,650
Speaker 1: So all I try to do is eliminate options one two and three as quickly as possible.

658
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:52,224
Speaker 1: Because of magic's on the table then all bets are off.

659
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:53,290
Speaker 0: start casting spells.

660
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,171
Speaker 1: Yep I am.

661
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:55,716
Speaker 1: that is Scott Johnson's go-to.

662
00:39:56,078 --> 00:40:05,823
Speaker 1: if you ever find a legit vampire or a real ghost you immediately Read like every magic spell you've ever heard of in your entire life Go to the borders and get yourself an economic on staff.

663
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,390
Speaker 1: You just start wearing amulets.

664
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:10,722
Speaker 1: You start looking for more vampires like spice of garlic.

665
00:40:10,802 --> 00:40:12,810
Speaker 1: All you got to find is one and it's game on.

666
00:40:13,532 --> 00:40:15,138
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's that's it after that.

667
00:40:15,198 --> 00:40:15,499
Speaker 1: It's all.

668
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:16,582
Speaker 1: just choose your own adventure.

669
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:17,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was lame next.

670
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:18,088
Speaker 0: Okay.

671
00:40:18,108 --> 00:40:19,714
Speaker 1: Thanks Alright, let's see.

672
00:40:19,774 --> 00:40:20,597
Speaker 1: How do I get to the next?

673
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:23,930
Speaker 0: this is not my idea, but we don't have any other ideas for Thursday.

674
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,522
Speaker 0: So you have no choice, but alright fall on this backup plan.

675
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:29,830
Speaker 1: So a Canadian appropriate to this one.

676
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,083
Speaker 1: This is the hockey that I skinned.

677
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:33,956
Speaker 0: a Canadian Like a heavy time Canadian.

678
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,968
Speaker 0: a Canadian person a Canadian person not a Canadian person from Canada.

679
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:44,370
Speaker 1: Yep Game seven of the NHL Eastern Finals Rangers versus a new at New Jersey.

680
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:53,007
Speaker 1: Okay triple overtime Victory for the Rangers on a clearly blown call by the refs that does not get overturned.

681
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,749
Speaker 0: Oh, we'll take it.

682
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,173
Speaker 0: I think we can get but I'll admit this bullshit.

683
00:40:56,333 --> 00:41:06,510
Speaker 1: our riot ensues throughout the arena a parking lot and City, all right, you both arrived in full Rangers attire by car.

684
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:12,677
Speaker 1: You have a hundred and fifty dollars cash total Mm-hmm and your individual credit cards.

685
00:41:13,118 --> 00:41:17,930
Speaker 1: the bridge of a given starts in the front row behind the devil goaltender crap.

686
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:25,067
Speaker 1: So we're like we're surrounded Surrounded by a gang of irrational angry drunk David putty like devil's fans and body pain.

687
00:41:25,408 --> 00:41:26,110
Speaker 1: Please get home.

688
00:41:26,331 --> 00:41:27,857
Speaker 0: They're not actually gonna mess with us.

689
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:28,640
Speaker 0: We'll just go home.

690
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:31,290
Speaker 0: So we walk to the car and drive away slowly.

691
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:33,956
Speaker 1: It's a legit riot.

692
00:41:34,177 --> 00:41:39,015
Speaker 1: So like cars are being flipped over in the parking lot and in the entire city There's fight like the stands.

693
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:40,200
Speaker 1: they're fighting and angry.

694
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:42,610
Speaker 0: the train will take us home and we wouldn't even drive there.

695
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,681
Speaker 0: We would definitely take the train.

696
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:44,570
Speaker 1: So the crowd's angry.

697
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,489
Speaker 1: What if they like attack us like people are attacking each other fights everywhere?

698
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:50,421
Speaker 1: Run, okay, so we run we fight.

699
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:52,893
Speaker 1: I guess forget on the train I guess by.

700
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:54,881
Speaker 1: you know, you know now that I think about this.

701
00:41:54,941 --> 00:41:57,230
Speaker 0: riots aren't like as inescapable as you think.

702
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:02,774
Speaker 0: It's like I've been at sporting events where they're like big brawls and stuff and it's like yeah You're just not.

703
00:42:02,794 --> 00:42:03,035
Speaker 0: if you're.

704
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:04,967
Speaker 1: no, you know, make yourself a part of it.

705
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:05,550
Speaker 0: You're not part of this.

706
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,675
Speaker 0: Families at this game.

707
00:42:06,695 --> 00:42:10,010
Speaker 0: Well, you're older in right a city gonna be just fine - you just escape.

708
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,234
Speaker 1: Well people like I mean I would.

709
00:42:11,274 --> 00:42:16,715
Speaker 1: so I was in a riot in a crowded hockey game and I almost got hit a couple Times you can get.

710
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:24,310
Speaker 0: you can get hit like by you know, a stray bullet like, you know If there's some shooting that's unrelated to you, but I got hit like fists were coming and flying like they're right here.

711
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:26,347
Speaker 0: You just get away from the hot zone.

712
00:42:27,431 --> 00:42:31,710
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so I think the city and the parking lot literally don't matter.

713
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,119
Speaker 1: I actually I came up with a really good idea.

714
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,786
Speaker 1: So one let's assume these drum thing.

715
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:36,890
Speaker 0: You need a really good idea.

716
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,297
Speaker 0: I don't think it's a bad situation.

717
00:42:38,398 --> 00:42:38,981
Speaker 0: So what?

718
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:39,744
Speaker 1: so these these?

719
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:46,110
Speaker 1: these quote irrational Surrounded by an irrational angry drunk David putty like devil's fans and body paint.

720
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,008
Speaker 1: So there there are legit angry dudes who are trying to punch us.

721
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:51,490
Speaker 1: So I guess we punch it back and run.

722
00:42:51,570 --> 00:43:03,110
Speaker 1: but all I would do is I would run and try to get into like the hallways and You know all those hallways like at any arena that you're not supposed to go into that there's usually like a person.

723
00:43:03,592 --> 00:43:08,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you could definitely be using emergency exits to get out, you know, I wouldn't try to get out.

724
00:43:08,311 --> 00:43:18,837
Speaker 1: I would try to get into all the hallways that like staff use Because the way those are not usually like blocked or locked like you can usually get into them But there's arena staff who will let you in.

725
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:25,948
Speaker 1: if the arena staff are there and are in such control that they still won't let Me in I am safest by being right next to them.

726
00:43:26,454 --> 00:43:26,990
Speaker 1: That's all right.

727
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:29,137
Speaker 0: There's also plenty of security at these things.

728
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:35,339
Speaker 1: if the security is overwhelmed and they can't stop me from getting into those back hallways It's really really ridiculous.

729
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,750
Speaker 1: I just run it is not it and I just wait.

730
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:42,250
Speaker 0: There could not be that such a riot could not and you're it just couldn't be this.

731
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:42,854
Speaker 1: I think it could.

732
00:43:42,874 --> 00:43:45,129
Speaker 0: this is even more ridiculous than the hallucinating.

733
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,990
Speaker 1: A lot of people got like surrounded and attacked during like riots in LA and they couldn't get away.

734
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:50,613
Speaker 1: Like what do you do?

735
00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:52,342
Speaker 0: That was a different kind of riot.

736
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,186
Speaker 1: This road is this.

737
00:43:53,227 --> 00:43:53,830
Speaker 1: rides like that.

738
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,237
Speaker 1: It's like legit off the hook.

739
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,503
Speaker 1: be what it sounds like.

740
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,608
Speaker 1: it is triple overtime.

741
00:43:57,628 --> 00:44:00,822
Speaker 0: in New Jersey Hockey arena is half full of businessmen and children.

742
00:44:01,384 --> 00:44:02,429
Speaker 1: Well, what if they're all crazy?

743
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:05,957
Speaker 1: Stadium, all right.

744
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,570
Speaker 1: What if same scenario but it was soccer.

745
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:12,770
Speaker 0: I don't go there because that kind of thing can happen there if I won't do a soccer game like that.

746
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:18,590
Speaker 1: If soccer if hockey fans were like soccer hooligans, I would not wear a Rangers jersey at that game.

747
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:21,602
Speaker 1: I would actually wear a New Jersey Jersey to blend in.

748
00:44:21,782 --> 00:44:26,418
Speaker 0: I would not go to a place That was the soccer stadium where that sort of thing could happen.

749
00:44:26,779 --> 00:44:30,170
Speaker 1: All right, let's see you're at a dinner party dinner and boardgame party.

750
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:32,099
Speaker 1: This is from the terrible secret of space.

751
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,737
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm hosted by a couple with whom you are friends Mm-hmm, and they begin to argue during the board game.

752
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:39,647
Speaker 1: The argument grows in intensity becoming louder and meaner.

753
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:45,290
Speaker 1: awkward Yep, with both of them escalating to the point of trying to provoke other people into joining the argument on their side.

754
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,909
Speaker 1: So so far just to stop the person who submitted this.

755
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:54,405
Speaker 1: that happens on a like Regular basis in our own friend group every time like all the time.

756
00:44:54,445 --> 00:44:55,408
Speaker 0: Like you're allowed to argue.

757
00:44:55,428 --> 00:44:55,890
Speaker 0: What's the pattern?

758
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:59,547
Speaker 1: We literally try to provoke each other into joining sides in these arguments.

759
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:00,190
Speaker 0: What's the problem?

760
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,440
Speaker 1: How do you extradite yourself extricate yourself from the situation?

761
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:03,741
Speaker 1: You don't?

762
00:45:03,762 --> 00:45:05,347
Speaker 0: you just are social fallout as possible.

763
00:45:05,387 --> 00:45:06,873
Speaker 1: No, I just argue Just argue.

764
00:45:06,893 --> 00:45:07,516
Speaker 1: What's the problem?

765
00:45:07,596 --> 00:45:10,850
Speaker 1: You take the opportunity to win the game while the other players are distracted and unfolding.

766
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:12,181
Speaker 0: Of course, I complain.

767
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:12,564
Speaker 0: Come on.

768
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,270
Speaker 0: Let's take your turn.

769
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:17,533
Speaker 0: I'm not one to stop arguing but take your goddamn Turns.

770
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:18,337
Speaker 1: I was Christ.

771
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:19,343
Speaker 0: take your goddamn turn.

772
00:45:19,443 --> 00:45:23,990
Speaker 1: if they keep taking their turns Then the arguments not that bad and I'm gonna use their distraction to win the game.

773
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:27,749
Speaker 1: Duh, if their argument stops the game, I argue with them.

774
00:45:28,651 --> 00:45:30,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't even try to get out.

775
00:45:30,457 --> 00:45:33,228
Speaker 1: I this is literally my regular gaming experience.

776
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:33,850
Speaker 0: What's wrong with that?

777
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:34,773
Speaker 0: I don't see.

778
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:35,878
Speaker 0: how is this even a predicament?

779
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:36,841
Speaker 0: This is just every day.

780
00:45:37,122 --> 00:45:39,010
Speaker 1: How would you solve the Brewster's millions problem?

781
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,122
Speaker 0: What's the Brewster's millions from you don't know the Bruce's.

782
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:42,310
Speaker 0: I've heard of Brewster's millions.

783
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,737
Speaker 0: Isn't it like a TV show or something?

784
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:44,239
Speaker 1: Okay.

785
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:51,290
Speaker 1: So the idea is you're given a Ridiculous amount of money in a bank account cash you use for anything each time.

786
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,800
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna read this whole thing, but I can.

787
00:45:52,901 --> 00:45:54,109
Speaker 1: I can summarize it pretty succinctly.

788
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:02,779
Speaker 1: Okay, you must within 30 days from the moment you got this crazy amount of money Like let's say 300 million dollars Mm-hmm.

789
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:13,489
Speaker 1: If you liquid spend all of it and by the end of 30 days have nothing left But things you own before you got the third 300 million you get 3 billion.

790
00:46:14,632 --> 00:46:18,570
Speaker 0: Wait, I have to spend all the 300 and you can't give it to charity.

791
00:46:18,851 --> 00:46:22,672
Speaker 1: You can't gamble it because because you can't make stupid gambling I can't.

792
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:25,686
Speaker 0: I can't just invest it you because then you're making more money.

793
00:46:25,927 --> 00:46:33,849
Speaker 1: you have to get Reasonable and appropriate value for the spending of the money and have none left and nothing left by the end of 30 days.

794
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:40,422
Speaker 1: 30 million, let's say 300 million 300 million giant amount of money.

795
00:46:40,442 --> 00:46:40,964
Speaker 0: So I have to have.

796
00:46:40,984 --> 00:46:43,253
Speaker 0: I have to spend it all You.

797
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:44,055
Speaker 1: you can't just give it.

798
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:48,250
Speaker 1: you have to get some reasonable value for your spending like you can throw a giant party.

799
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:49,314
Speaker 1: That's totally cool.

800
00:46:49,535 --> 00:46:50,459
Speaker 1: You can't just burn it.

801
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,929
Speaker 1: You can't just like buy Faberge eggs and eat them.

802
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:54,796
Speaker 0: Couldn't I just buy like a sports team?

803
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:56,623
Speaker 1: I guess that's making money.

804
00:46:56,643 --> 00:47:01,734
Speaker 1: You'd have to make that sports team suck Like The sports team is an asset.

805
00:47:01,915 --> 00:47:04,324
Speaker 1: You'd have to destroy the value of the asset within 30 days.

806
00:47:04,344 --> 00:47:06,371
Speaker 0: Oh I had.

807
00:47:06,411 --> 00:47:10,690
Speaker 0: so I have to but then I would get 3 billion and then I could just buy like multiple sports.

808
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:14,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, the goal is you spend it all and then you are one of the wealthiest people in the world forever.

809
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,080
Speaker 0: I'd buy a Boat and sink it.

810
00:47:18,664 --> 00:47:19,390
Speaker 1: No, it's specific.

811
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,591
Speaker 1: There's.

812
00:47:19,611 --> 00:47:22,019
Speaker 1: so there's a specific rule in the Bruce's millions thing.

813
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,572
Speaker 1: You cannot buy luxury goods just to destroy them Specifically.

814
00:47:26,592 --> 00:47:29,070
Speaker 0: so basically this is a really stupid question.

815
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,910
Speaker 0: It's like oh tell me how do you solve this problem?

816
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:37,775
Speaker 0: And then we're gonna make a special exception for every possible answer like like what's one plus one But you can't say two.

817
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:39,220
Speaker 0: who is not an allowable answer to me?

818
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,424
Speaker 0: another answer besides what.

819
00:47:40,504 --> 00:47:44,789
Speaker 0: I actually have a really trivial way to Do this get to get it all in cash and burn it.

820
00:47:45,475 --> 00:47:52,750
Speaker 1: I would just found a Bunch of game companies to make the kinds of games that I want with ridiculous budgets and give the games away for free.

821
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,497
Speaker 0: But you still own these game companies.

822
00:47:55,517 --> 00:47:58,730
Speaker 1: the game companies are worth bupkis because they don't have any revenue stream.

823
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:00,557
Speaker 0: Oh, I got it.

824
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:01,262
Speaker 0: I got it.

825
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:12,150
Speaker 0: I would hire an employee To work for me and pay them to be your personal and I would pay them $300,000,000 for like one hour of being my personal servant.

826
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,339
Speaker 1: Okay, even if they need value, right say you have to get reasonable value.

827
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,119
Speaker 1: hire a giant team of butlers to cater your personal living Experience to a ridiculous ultra stupid degree.

828
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:27,757
Speaker 0: I would hire an army of people for whatever amount of time Minimum wage to March somewhere.

829
00:48:27,837 --> 00:48:29,021
Speaker 1: do the Lewis black ball washer.

830
00:48:29,422 --> 00:48:30,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, something whatever.

831
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:32,030
Speaker 1: That's what I do Lewis black ball washer.

832
00:48:33,716 --> 00:48:41,358
Speaker 0: I'd have the Lewis black ball washer Equivalent of a bunch of game studios and hire people to do whatever for a amount of time and then all the money's gone And all the people are fired the end.

833
00:48:41,378 --> 00:48:43,410
Speaker 1: I'd also hire people remember that movie the game.

834
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,310
Speaker 0: I hire some of them to clean my apartment - I do that.

835
00:48:47,652 --> 00:48:50,770
Speaker 1: I would hire people to run the game for me from that movie the game.

836
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:54,379
Speaker 1: All right, whatever they're actually killing time.

837
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:55,383
Speaker 1: I don't think we'll get through all of them.

838
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:57,030
Speaker 0: It's also really stupid question.

839
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:57,743
Speaker 1: I think it's fine.

840
00:48:57,804 --> 00:49:06,570
Speaker 1: ever accused Invisible people have invaded the city and they explode on contact with non invisible people and they want to do this.

841
00:49:07,092 --> 00:49:11,130
Speaker 1: You and only you can see them and they only respond with laughter.

842
00:49:12,331 --> 00:49:13,415
Speaker 1: What will you do?

843
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:16,790
Speaker 1: so I can see them and if they touch a person they explode including me.

844
00:49:17,411 --> 00:49:20,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get the fuck out of the city because that's dangerous.

845
00:49:20,422 --> 00:49:22,430
Speaker 1: There's no way to solve that and I wait for it to die down.

846
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:23,495
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

847
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:24,239
Speaker 1: That's all I would do.

848
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:24,661
Speaker 1: There's nothing.

849
00:49:24,701 --> 00:49:26,450
Speaker 0: I could get any explosions all over the place.

850
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:28,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're gonna be grabbing everyone exploding everyone.

851
00:49:29,022 --> 00:49:30,830
Speaker 0: just cuz I can see them coming just like that.

852
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:34,950
Speaker 0: It just means I have a better chance of running away and properly like those golden compass monsters.

853
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:35,615
Speaker 1: You're just.

854
00:49:35,675 --> 00:49:36,602
Speaker 0: everyone else is just fuck.

855
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:37,630
Speaker 0: but at least I can get away.

856
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:41,370
Speaker 0: I mean I use the internet while I was running on my phone to warn people of well danger.

857
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:42,823
Speaker 1: I mean I'd warn my friends.

858
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:43,891
Speaker 1: we get the fuck out I'm sure.

859
00:49:44,011 --> 00:49:53,260
Speaker 0: as I was running I could do various things to help other people like throw sacks of flour around or You know stuff like that.

860
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,507
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I think his flowers.

861
00:49:54,527 --> 00:49:59,510
Speaker 0: a good idea But you know in general just run until I'm away from this craziness cuz you can't win.

862
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:04,910
Speaker 0: I would save myself and I just if I get far enough away the density of these invisible people is lowered.

863
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,520
Speaker 0: I could just get guns cuz that's invaded and I have no problem.

864
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:11,389
Speaker 0: if there were invisible people who explode and kill you when they Touch you I have no problem shooting them.

865
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:19,701
Speaker 0: so yeah, as soon as I get far enough away from the city to gun land, I would get some gun and Slowly make my way back sort of like a zombie situation.

866
00:50:19,761 --> 00:50:20,926
Speaker 1: It says invaded the city.

867
00:50:20,966 --> 00:50:21,770
Speaker 1: So they invade New York.

868
00:50:22,111 --> 00:50:23,798
Speaker 1: I let the invisible people have New York.

869
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,405
Speaker 1: I go live in some other city.

870
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:26,670
Speaker 1: That's that's the best.

871
00:50:26,952 --> 00:50:29,830
Speaker 0: I'm sure the government would come and clean them out after and then I could come back.

872
00:50:29,951 --> 00:50:32,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if they invade the rest of the country What was I gonna do about it?

873
00:50:32,514 --> 00:50:35,485
Speaker 0: go to somewhere across water because there's still people.

874
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:37,050
Speaker 1: they they only respond with laughter.

875
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,199
Speaker 1: So I can't like make myself their leader or anything.

876
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,504
Speaker 0: It's a really stupid question.

877
00:50:40,544 --> 00:50:40,765
Speaker 0: Again.

892
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:27,468
Speaker 1: The town has specific days, so it's like Nazi dystopia.

893
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:29,962
Speaker 1: Everyone in powers and all the cops never know.

894
00:51:29,982 --> 00:51:30,646

00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:48,714
Speaker 1: if you piss the farmers off They discredit your two weeks meaning you have to do it again somewhere else I do it somewhere else.

903
00:51:49,156 --> 00:51:55,547
Speaker 1: if if society exists such that I could not get out of this situation I would turn to organize my violence.

904
00:51:55,588 --> 00:52:06,323
Speaker 0: to end I just want to point out right look how many not only on the millions one but on this one and all the other ones Right how many exceptions people have to make to make a situation truly a predicament.

905
00:52:06,363 --> 00:52:11,985
Speaker 0: that shows you just how safe Modern real society is.

906
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,955
Speaker 1: look at ever almost So difficult.

907
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:18,210
Speaker 1: every predicament movie has to make cell phones not work.

908
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,153
Speaker 0: They're like not.

909
00:52:19,194 --> 00:52:25,457
Speaker 0: my cell phones are the biggest most powerful tool that everyone's carrying right like the ultimate weaponry But there's like even without cell phones.

910
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:29,090
Speaker 0: It's like there are just so many ways to get out of a bad situation.

911
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:34,686
Speaker 0: It's like it's really hard for bad things of any large magnitude to happen, right?

912
00:52:35,308 --> 00:52:44,566
Speaker 0: It's like It's not really reasons to worry about much because like people have to come up with such ridiculous Nonsense scenarios for there to be any sense of danger whatsoever.

913
00:52:44,747 --> 00:52:48,022
Speaker 1: I'm looking for one That's like really short because we've done basically a whole show.

914
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:49,790
Speaker 0: That's why Godzilla is a thing, right?

915
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:54,606
Speaker 0: You need some ridiculous thing like giant radioactive monsters stomps and breathes fire on everything.

916
00:52:54,866 --> 00:52:55,930
Speaker 0: That's the level of danger.

917
00:52:56,371 --> 00:52:58,136
Speaker 1: Here's a short one from Ren from New Zealand.

918
00:52:58,518 --> 00:53:02,229
Speaker 1: really simple and there's no exceptions at all home invasion at night.

919
00:53:02,249 --> 00:53:04,749
Speaker 1: You're in your bed So, uh, you're in your bedroom.

920
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:11,067
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm the door busts open at night someone comes in and they have a melee weapon to the bedroom.

921
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:11,468
Speaker 1: Yeah.

922
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:12,330
Speaker 0: All right bedroom.

923
00:53:12,391 --> 00:53:13,439
Speaker 1: They have a knife or a bat.

924
00:53:13,459 --> 00:53:14,669
Speaker 1: you can't quite tell cuz it's dark.

925
00:53:14,851 --> 00:53:16,440
Speaker 0: Are they gonna hurt me or they just want to rob me?

926
00:53:16,963 --> 00:53:18,130
Speaker 1: Uh, it's home invasion.

927
00:53:18,251 --> 00:53:21,044
Speaker 1: So you don't know what their intentions are, but they're yelling cuz I'm.

928
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:22,350
Speaker 1: it's really simply what are they?

929
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,112
Speaker 0: What are they yelling?

930
00:53:23,394 --> 00:53:24,960
Speaker 1: We don't know it would you don't know?

931
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,590
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's just assume they're yelling and it's unintelligible.

932
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:29,754
Speaker 0: Whoa, bro, chill out.

933
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:30,276
Speaker 0: Chill out, bro.

934
00:53:30,497 --> 00:53:31,340
Speaker 0: Whoa, what's the problem?

935
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:32,826
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna rob me.

936
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:33,208
Speaker 0: Go ahead.

937
00:53:33,248 --> 00:53:34,660
Speaker 0: Go rob me Just don't stab me.

938
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:35,450
Speaker 0: What's the problem?

939
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:48,010
Speaker 1: I feel like honestly in that situation if I'm in my bedroom and someone busts in yelling and has what looks like a weapon I Yell, I do the yellow bro thing, but I also probably immediately attack them with the sheets.

940
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:49,830
Speaker 1: I just throw the sheets at their face.

941
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:54,891
Speaker 0: I mean, I'd probably be you know defending with the pillow hoping they can like a knife gets caught in the I'd be doing other Things.

942
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:56,698
Speaker 1: but like I immediately attack.

943
00:53:56,738 --> 00:54:01,941
Speaker 0: but the primary thing I'm trying to do is just like talk to them Like why you're robbing me like if someone like.

944
00:54:01,961 --> 00:54:05,096
Speaker 0: if I'm walking down the street and someone shows up to me There's like give me your phone.

945
00:54:05,136 --> 00:54:06,582
Speaker 0: I'd be like really like.

946
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,230
Speaker 1: really you want a hundred bucks instead.

947
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:10,490
Speaker 0: It's gotta find my iPhone.

948
00:54:11,451 --> 00:54:12,194
Speaker 0: Sure, you want it.

949
00:54:12,576 --> 00:54:13,500
Speaker 1: I'll give you my cash.

950
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,870
Speaker 0: I mean if you're gonna stab me, I'll just give you the fucking phone.

951
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:16,500
Speaker 0: It's not a big deal.

952
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,250
Speaker 0: Here you go Like I'm gonna call the cops as soon as you run away.

953
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,868
Speaker 0: You sure you don't want to give him the phone back?

954
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:30,279
Speaker 1: I guess I would know regardless of any words that giver said I would not stop attacking them Until I had full control of the situation.

955
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:34,855
Speaker 1: no matter what words they said, even if they said I'm just gonna rob you Probably still attack them.

956
00:54:35,056 --> 00:54:36,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's definitely opportunity.

957
00:54:37,025 --> 00:54:38,150
Speaker 1: No, no, they might be lying.

958
00:54:39,132 --> 00:54:41,149
Speaker 0: There's definitely opportunities to see where things go.

959
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:47,250
Speaker 0: But I mean my primary technique is to just like talk to them and be like really you're robbing me.

960
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,558
Speaker 0: I mean you're gonna take my credit card.

961
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:49,665
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna cancel that shit.

962
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:49,946
Speaker 0: Come on.

963
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:50,530
Speaker 0: Are you serious?

964
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:52,581
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, there's a big difference.

965
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:54,799
Speaker 0: like you're gonna stab me Okay, cuz now it's a murder.

966
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,970
Speaker 0: the cops don't give a shit about a mugging But if you're suddenly a murder you're gonna have every cop in town over here.

967
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:02,150
Speaker 1: So to be fair though a mugging is much more opportunistic.

968
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:12,370
Speaker 1: but home invasion like that already implies like a lot of premeditation and In a somewhat unhinged it's still not as nearly as bad as the consequences of murder.

969
00:55:12,431 --> 00:55:16,384
Speaker 1: But if I was gonna rob a house I would rob a house that didn't have anyone in it.

970
00:55:16,424 --> 00:55:17,510
Speaker 1: like I wait for them go to vacation.

971
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:21,986
Speaker 0: I hope my apartment got burgled when I wasn't there and the cops didn't even bother.

972
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:23,792
Speaker 0: but if they do I'd follow you Okay book.

973
00:55:23,872 --> 00:55:25,919
Speaker 0: I know when you're on vacation and then I robbed your house.

974
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:35,330
Speaker 0: if they had murdered me or it assaulted me in some Way, the cops would have definitely put in much more effort into finding their asses and it wouldn't have been that hard.

975
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:48,236
Speaker 1: It's because all they did was a home invasion with a weapon implies Dangerous and crazy because home alone is the style to go except if there's a home alone kid in the house Just rob all the other neighbors houses.

976
00:55:48,337 --> 00:55:51,910
Speaker 0: Also, you know, I can call 911 silently in my phone.

977
00:55:52,592 --> 00:55:55,401
Speaker 1: I I would fight all their father burgling because I couldn't.

978
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:57,950
Speaker 1: I couldn't dial 9-1-1 on my phone while I was fighting them.

979
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:02,620
Speaker 1: It has an emergency button on the front like, you know, yeah that takes a few clicks though I gotta swipe up and then hit.

980
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,467
Speaker 0: it's right next to my.

981
00:56:05,215 --> 00:56:05,457
Speaker 1: How many?

982
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:06,504
Speaker 1: how quickly could I download?

983
00:56:06,524 --> 00:56:06,705
Speaker 1: no one.

984
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:11,220
Speaker 1: let's see swipe emergency call 9-1, okay, I do like four clicks here.

985
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,150
Speaker 0: Hmm, but you can do it as soon as you know.

986
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,680
Speaker 0: You get a chance as soon as you can right?

987
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you don't even need to say anything.

988
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,050
Speaker 0: You can just sort of leave it on speaker and with the volume all the way down.

989
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,838
Speaker 0: So you don't hear the 9-1-1, but they hear you.

990
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:23,470
Speaker 0: Yep, and they would get the idea of what's going on.

991
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:26,758
Speaker 1: Alright, I think I killed enough time.

992
00:56:26,778 --> 00:56:27,721
