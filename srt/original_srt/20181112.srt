1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,230
Speaker 1: It's Monday, November 12th 2018.

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,052
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:14,440
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nice tonight.

4
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:18,219
Speaker 1: Why aren't there any good Monday shows for us to do?

5
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:30,675
Speaker 1: Let's do this So this weekend for the second time in a row of two years because when it was the thing Emily and I run races like 5k or whatever.

6
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:33,740
Speaker 1: It's kind of like a thing That's really easy to do and really easy to organize.

7
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:35,950
Speaker 1: But the Rangers do one.

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,939
Speaker 1: that's like the super charity thing where it's expensive Because all the money goes to like the charity.

9
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:48,704
Speaker 1: So we run it every year and this year like P on was there and he high-fived us at them surprised anyone was there because they were in Columbus the night before.

10
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:55,602
Speaker 0: they're in Columbus playing a night game the game back to back game the games over at like 10 Columbus time.

11
00:00:55,863 --> 00:01:01,939
Speaker 0: then they're in New York the next day at the crack-ass of dawn running a 5k with a bunch of just slubs like me.

12
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:08,120
Speaker 1: But like he was there a whole bunch of like legacy like old Rangers were there and it's always like this fun thing.

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,124
Speaker 0: It's nothing else to do.

14
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:11,755
Speaker 1: It's like 50 bucks, but all the money goes to 50 bucks.

15
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:13,562
Speaker 1: Yes cheap dude I'm normal.

16
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:14,866
Speaker 0: do charity bike races.

17
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:16,131
Speaker 0: They want you to bring thousands.

18
00:01:16,372 --> 00:01:19,523
Speaker 1: dude normal 5k is like a regular race I run in the city.

19
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:22,875
Speaker 1: Like if you book it in advance, we're talking like 15 to 20 bucks.

20
00:01:23,477 --> 00:01:26,392
Speaker 0: like charity bike races They want you to bring thousands of dollars.

21
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:30,335
Speaker 1: Yeah foot races It's partly because there's a couple of organizations that have the equipment.

22
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,283
Speaker 0: I guess for running You don't really need.

23
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:33,708
Speaker 1: well, you need the typical.

24
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:35,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't need bicycle shit, but all that.

25
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:37,480
Speaker 0: but the running stuff is reusable, right?

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, well that the so you need the electronic things in the bibs Yeah, but those are disposable right.

27
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:47,700
Speaker 1: and then you need the chip tracking stuff for the splits and the start and the finish.

28
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:50,091
Speaker 1: But that's pretty much it like you.

29
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,719
Speaker 1: bring it and set it up for a bike thing.

30
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,219
Speaker 0: first Someone has to lay out the course.

31
00:01:53,408 --> 00:02:00,606
Speaker 1: Yeah And the course has to be a lot more tight because on a running race like the course could just be like pretty much any Street anywhere in the city.

32
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:03,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, the course has to be long hundred miles plus.

33
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:06,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, our courses are like you got a market.

34
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:07,114
Speaker 1: our courses are 5k 10k.

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,170
Speaker 0: You gotta have rest stops full of food.

36
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:11,520
Speaker 1: We don't need any rest stops.

37
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,229
Speaker 1: You think the run table with water.

38
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,119
Speaker 0: the ride takes almost all day.

39
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,294
Speaker 0: Not you know, that's what you could do in the morning and then go home.

40
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:19,097
Speaker 1: 5k takes 20 minutes.

41
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:21,456
Speaker 0: Yeah, this takes all fucking day.

42
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:25,739
Speaker 0: So maybe it's the same dollar per minute ratio.

43
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:32,519
Speaker 1: So what's interesting is I'm getting older and my like short race times are getting worse.

44
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:39,971
Speaker 1: cuz Like I keep saying on the show 35 ain't 25 and I ain't even 35 But my long distance times are getting better.

45
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:42,020
Speaker 1: So I tried to push myself.

46
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,712
Speaker 1: I tried to like despite the fact that I'm getting older.

47
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:48,180
Speaker 1: I actually tried to do well in this race.

48
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,330
Speaker 0: I trained for it and I ran hard to end again.

49
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:54,684
Speaker 1: I did vomit at the end Because and I'd so.

50
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:59,998
Speaker 1: the problem is actually I got almost the exact same time as last year 20 minutes 11 seconds.

51
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:05,473
Speaker 1: I was number four overall in my age group and I was 16 overall among everybody.

52
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:07,920
Speaker 0: numbers 1 2 & 3 age group also vomit.

53
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:11,654
Speaker 1: Uh, I saw another person vomit right over the finish line.

54
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:12,116
Speaker 1: Just like me.

55
00:03:12,136 --> 00:03:19,400
Speaker 1: It wasn't just me But the trouble I have is that these short races to push myself at the end.

56
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:24,140
Speaker 1: My body is just like rim rim your old rim rim slow down Jesus rim god damn.

57
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,480
Speaker 1: But because there's like a sprint at the end.

58
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:33,180
Speaker 1: But in a long race you just run like the race is so long that running faster in the last hundred yards doesn't mean shit.

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,164
Speaker 0: It saves you a fraction.

60
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:38,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, but running faster in the last hundred yards is the difference between fourth place and third place.

61
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:42,338
Speaker 1: So yeah, it was super fun and I got the exact same time as last year.

62
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:48,362
Speaker 1: Meaning I am at best slightly staving off the rad which is of age Mm-hmm.

63
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:49,726
Speaker 1: That's what I got.

64
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:50,850
Speaker 1: Okay race though.

65
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:57,160
Speaker 0: So someone tweeted that Joe his say she if you don't know who that is this the guy who composed.

66
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:58,564
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I didn't buy tickets.

67
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:02,076
Speaker 0: that concert all the music for Studio Ghibli movies.

68
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:08,600
Speaker 0: This stuff is real good Was putting on a concert at Carnegie Hall and I'm like, hey, I've been past Carnegie Hall like a thousand times.

69
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,849
Speaker 0: I know exactly where that is.

70
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:10,594
Speaker 0: It's a famous place.

71
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:11,359
Speaker 0: I've never been in there.

72
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,367
Speaker 0: Really when have you been in there?

73
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:14,491
Speaker 1: I saw some concerts in there.

74
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:15,173
Speaker 0: What'd you see in there?

75
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:19,309
Speaker 1: like 10 11 years ago I saw a piano concert.

76
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,260
Speaker 1: It was this famous guy to remember his name and he did a rock mountain off.

77
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,440
Speaker 0: He did another thing anyway, so I'm like, oh and I look and the tickets were hella cheap.

78
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,143
Speaker 0: So I just bought him.

79
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:35,545
Speaker 0: So apparently I found out after buying the tickets that Apparently last week He was performed.

80
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:40,180
Speaker 0: they were conducting had like the orchestra symphony or whatever and they were doing Studio Ghibli music.

81
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, oh shit.

82
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:44,600
Speaker 0: This one isn't that is the weebs always sell those out.

83
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,706
Speaker 0: So that one is in the Carnegie Hall is the building.

84
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:53,529
Speaker 0: it has three different I guess Theaters in it halls three different music halls.

85
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:54,974
Speaker 0: in Carnegie Hall, right?

86
00:04:55,215 --> 00:04:55,937
Speaker 0: Which is the building?

87
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:56,740
Speaker 0: this I forget.

88
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,194
Speaker 0: This is the big one, which is what you think of as Carnegie Hall.

89
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:09,371
Speaker 0: I forget what it's called Is that there's a recital Hall which I guess is for recitals and very small things like maybe one person singing Maybe maybe a quartet maybe I don't know.

90
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:20,941
Speaker 0: and then we were in Zenko Hall which is like the medium-sized one and it had like a chamber orchestra in there, right and He was performing that he was Conducting.

91
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:21,423
Speaker 0: What is it?

92
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:28,570
Speaker 0: Like he recomposed a Philip Glass piece from the 60s and then That's kind of his thing like every year.

93
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,340
Speaker 1: He'll make like a set of new pieces.

94
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:35,320
Speaker 0: It was like very modern music right this this Lang guy composed to other things even though his size.

95
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:49,140
Speaker 0: She was conducting all of it and then like after the intermission This really good singing singer came out and this weird-looking but still good at playing Cellist came out and was like sitting on a platform set from everyone.

96
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:52,087
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that was good.

97
00:05:52,569 --> 00:06:05,279
Speaker 0: But the thing I want to talk about is that before the show We were sitting around eating some ramens right like you do and I go I know and the ticket was a PDF on my phone Because like you do it's no 2018. so I'm like, huh?

98
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,792
Speaker 0: You know that it's like six twenty and the shows at seven thirty.

99
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,000
Speaker 0: and I'm like, when should we go over there?

100
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,000
Speaker 0: Let me refer to the ticket that let me refer to the ticket to see when we should go over there.

101
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:16,867
Speaker 1: No, you're in.

102
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,519
Speaker 0: maybe it has some info on it.

103
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:24,626
Speaker 0: Look at the ticket and I start reading it and I'm reading all the fine print on the ticket and eventually I get to some Fine print.

104
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:31,104
Speaker 0: it says yo You have to print this out on paper, even though it's And I was like.

105
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,251
Speaker 0: what the fuck are you fucking kidding me?

106
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:40,000
Speaker 0: is 2018 is the famous venue I can go to Madison Square Garden with a barcode up with a QR code on my watch.

107
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,872
Speaker 0: Yep, I went to the World Series with the ticket on my phone.

108
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:48,980
Speaker 0: I can go to the Game devs of color with a barcode from event, right?

109
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:50,321
Speaker 0: Right.

110
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:57,800
Speaker 0: This is fucking Carnegie Hall a world-famous musical venue that people they're like famous jokes about and you need a piece of fucking paper.

111
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,024
Speaker 0: What kind of like.

112
00:06:59,164 --> 00:07:00,869
Speaker 0: they should be fucking embarrassed, right?

113
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:04,280
Speaker 0: So the story I want to talk about is I'm in Manhattan.

114
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,985
Speaker 0: How the hell did I read this out?

115
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:12,060
Speaker 1: Yep, because it was this brief era in a distant past where there were a lot of facilities.

116
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:18,093
Speaker 0: It's a good thing that I checked because more of the fine print also said yeah, we're not gonna print this out for you haha.

117
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,651
Speaker 0: So I went and I'm like, where can I print something?

118
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,840
Speaker 1: and I'm thinking I know where you can print some staples.

119
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,645
Speaker 0: Yep, so I search for staples.

120
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:28,811
Speaker 0: No, it's closed at 630 on Sunday fuck.

121
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:33,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Sunday, so I searched for Kinko's which is now FedEx office.

122
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:38,640
Speaker 0: So I searched her FedEx office and I go there and there was one open just a few blocks away.

123
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:41,470
Speaker 0: I actually known I'd known of his location previously.

124
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,113
Speaker 0: See I could have she.

125
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,000
Speaker 1: I would have just gone to my place of employment.

126
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,823
Speaker 1: That's not that far.

127
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:45,687
Speaker 0: I'm as far away.

128
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:50,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I go to this FedEx office and I'm like, alright I have a PDF any email.

129
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:50,903
Speaker 0: How do I print it?

130
00:07:51,344 --> 00:08:05,731
Speaker 0: and I'm looking around and I look at around and I see this some copy a big fancy copy machine And next to it is a little terminal and a sign and the sign is like yo forward your attachment to email address at FedEx comm.

131
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,320
Speaker 0: then we're gonna email you a number and I'm like.

132
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,609
Speaker 0: I know so I do it and I wait.

133
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:19,279
Speaker 0: worst-case scenario some employee of FedEx goes and sees Joe his size Very and they can get to Carnegie Hall in an hour with that more power to it.

134
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,329
Speaker 0: I'm waiting and I'm waiting and nothing happens.

135
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,432
Speaker 0: So I start poking.

136
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:26,880
Speaker 0: I emailed I forwarded the email nothing happens.

137
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,953
Speaker 0: So poking the terminal and the terminals like alright, you can get a USB stick.

138
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,100
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah, no, that's not happy.

139
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:37,176
Speaker 0: They're like you can log into your Google Drive on this terminal.

140
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,894
Speaker 0: and oh hell no I'm like, I really don't want to do that.

141
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:45,245
Speaker 0: I Really do not want to log into my Google Drive Terminal.

142
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,172
Speaker 1: that's the equivalent of.

143
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:48,522
Speaker 1: here is a hole Somewhere.

144
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:57,752

Speaker 1: my good sir Please present an appendage of your choice into this mysterious hole.

147
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:05,683
Speaker 0: So I'm like.

148
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:12,531
Speaker 0: I go to the attachment and I push the button that saves the attachment to Google Drive And I'm like, I really don't want to do this.

149
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,300
Speaker 0: I really would not like this option.

150
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,270
Speaker 0: They also had a Dropbox option and some other options.

151
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,240
Speaker 1: I'd be more like inclined to make a Dropbox account.

152
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:26,005
Speaker 0: I thought of that as well, but luckily as I'm waiting there It just took some for like.

153
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,852
Speaker 0: it took like almost five plus minutes.

154
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,060
Speaker 0: I get an email that's like here's your fucking code.

155
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:31,033
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh, thank god.

156
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:31,235
Speaker 0: Yeah.

157
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:38,142
Speaker 0: So I go to the terminal I type the code in I dip my credit card in the in the slot and two pieces of paper Come out.

158
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:39,891
Speaker 0: and that's how that works.

159
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:48,040
Speaker 0: You know, it's funny because in the course of my life I've gone through their own like FedEx cloud where the attachment was located and I had to like choose the file on the little terminal.

160
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:52,040
Speaker 1: But if I think about like printing adventures, yeah, I said they sent me an email today.

161
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,004
Speaker 0: There's like how was the show?

162
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:54,732
Speaker 0: and I'm like the show was fantastic.

163
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,440
Speaker 0: You should be fucking embarrassed.

164
00:09:56,841 --> 00:10:02,298
Speaker 0: Yeah that I have to bring a digital ticket that I can't bring a digital ticket to your show is a disgrace.

165
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:02,900
Speaker 0: fix that shit.

166
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,660
Speaker 1: I mean I went from as a child using a RZA graph because the school couldn't afford an actual a coffee machine.

167
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:20,753
Speaker 1: My school always had a copy yep to going to a Kinko's and trying to Xerox pages from my Dungeons and Dragons Cyclopedia and them stopping me and saying I can't violate the copyrights by doing so.

168
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:25,091
Speaker 0: it says on the character sheet page Specifically you can copy this one and they didn't age.

169
00:10:25,152 --> 00:10:26,639
Speaker 1: They did wanted nothing to do with it.

170
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:30,249
Speaker 1: They turned me away and were real shitty about it.

171
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:31,673
Speaker 0: It's a library.

172
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:33,297
Speaker 0: never actually bothered you just go nuts.

173
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:38,240
Speaker 1: Yeah Usually we went for copies of that brief era where there were multiple retail places.

174
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,684
Speaker 1: You could go to print shit and copy shit to the era where who prints anything anymore Like if I print something at work.

175
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:51,959
Speaker 0: people don't realize most bodegas in New York still will do like fax machine Stuff and print out a thing for you.

176
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Speaker 1: Well partly because a lot of poorer and more disadvantaged people really need to be able to fax shit other places in New York.

177
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,332
Speaker 0: I don't know if people have these and not not.

178
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:07,380
Speaker 0: I haven't seen them in suburbs a lot But you know the I've seen same-day cash checking places.

179
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:16,740
Speaker 0: Yeah payday loan places which are usually shady, but there's a place that's actually way useful Which is the get international credit phone card wire money places?

180
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,296
Speaker 0: Those places very often will do fax machine copying printing all that kind of stuff as well.

181
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:23,660
Speaker 0: And those are good places.

182
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:26,417
Speaker 0: Thankfully, I think some of them are also payday loan places.

183
00:11:26,457 --> 00:11:26,920
Speaker 0: then they're bad.

184
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:38,953
Speaker 1: Last time I had to do a fax Was when I tried to buy that house in Beacon and I had to fax a bunch of documents around and I can't fax to You by emailing an attachment to phone number at something that come.

185
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:40,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I'm not faxing.

186
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:55,117
Speaker 0: So I faxed from a bodega in Yonkers, it's just a warning to you if you buy tickets to a venue you haven't been to before Double-check that it's modern even though it's fucking 2018 and I haven't had a paper ticket for anything since maybe 2013 or even earlier.

187
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,250
Speaker 1: Well here same same deal, right?

188
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,380
Speaker 1: So we fly a lot, right?

189
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,683
Speaker 0: So yeah, I can use.

190
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:03,540
Speaker 0: I can use a digital ticket to get in a Jersey Transit fucking bus

191
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:04,423
Speaker 1: so

192
00:12:04,443 --> 00:12:14,760
Speaker 0: I can buy a ticket on my phone for that bus while I'm waiting for the bus and I can't go to Carnegie Hall a world-class musical institution and I had to have it bring a piece of paper.

193
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:27,179
Speaker 1: so, you know, I fly a lot and one thing I've learned is that The consistency with which e-tickets are accepted at airports if you're not flying to or from New York City It's so low that you're pretty much got to print shit out.

194
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,840
Speaker 0: No, I you I've not had a problem.

195
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,469
Speaker 0: You have not flown nearly as much as I have.

196
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:39,635
Speaker 0: but what I did have a problem with which is partially just cuz I didn't Fully understand it was I had the passport card that I got way back.

197
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,000
Speaker 1: You can't use that flying.

198
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,449
Speaker 0: I got that when I got my.

199
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:45,846
Speaker 0: I got that way back when I bought Passport card in America.

200
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:50,220
Speaker 1: basically means this is useless in 99% of all cases where you would want to use.

201
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,412
Speaker 0: So it's like I got it back when I got my passport.

202
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:56,820
Speaker 0: cuz I just picked the max option Just like I picked the max option for my new driver's license, right?

203
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,523
Speaker 1: Well, yeah I did the new.

204
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:04,528
Speaker 0: so the passport card said you can use this to go to Canada Mexico and Caribbean Islands fine print Not on a plane.

205
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:05,639
Speaker 0: I didn't see that.

206
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:09,780
Speaker 0: So I try, you know, I had my real one with me obviously cuz not a moron.

207
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:11,509
Speaker 0: But I was like, I can't use this one.

208
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:22,960
Speaker 0: They're like, no that's for like on a cruise ship or something yep, but yeah, the passport card is only for boats and land and the They said oh you can use your driver's license to re-entry into the u.s.

209
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:25,568
Speaker 0: It's like on boats or land.

210
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:26,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

211
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:26,751
Speaker 0: come on.

212
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:27,915
Speaker 0: What's the fucking point?

213
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,617
Speaker 1: There's no point.

214
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:29,640
Speaker 1: It's all just garbage.

215
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:31,260
Speaker 0: Let me use the passport card for everything.

216
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,002
Speaker 1: How about just not need a passport like when I was a kid and I could just go to Canada all the time Like they would just wave us through and not even ask you we were Mm-hmm.

217
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,430
Speaker 1: You got to get back to those days.

218
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,319
Speaker 0: somehow if you vote for Scott for president I will improve relations with Canada so that we don't need that anymore.

219
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:51,369
Speaker 0: So once they find out that the big hockey fan is president We all good.

220
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,358
Speaker 1: so in some news.

221
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:56,469
Speaker 1: So another problem of flying around the world a lot.

222
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:00,160
Speaker 1: Is that basically everywhere civilized except the United States?

223
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,184
Speaker 1: When you have a credit card, it's you can have a chip and pin meaning there's a chip.

224
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:05,989
Speaker 0: people in the u.s.

225
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,513
Speaker 0: Don't know this?

226
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:11,309
Speaker 1: and you know a pin and When you want to use your credit card, you have to input the pin.

227
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,420
Speaker 1: math happens to determine its two-factor authentication.

228
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,378
Speaker 0: Essentially, yeah, you put in your credit card in the slot which you did learn in the u.s.

229
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:23,560
Speaker 0: Recently Yep, but then you actually to type in a number just like you do with your ATM card.

230
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, otherwise, it won't fucking work.

231
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:27,620
Speaker 0: So if someone steals your credit card, they can't go around buying shit.

232
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,712
Speaker 1: But this does not work the same way and there's no signature.

233
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:32,921
Speaker 0: No don't do any as a debit card Like.

234
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:34,065
Speaker 1: it's not the same math.

235
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,109
Speaker 1: It's not the same system.

236
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:35,831
Speaker 1: It's totally different.

237
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:38,360
Speaker 0: So it actually provides real security.

238
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:48,300
Speaker 1: so many of you younger people won't know because I Learned recently that most People who are younger than us have never even heard of the idea of a cash advance because they're largely disappearing.

239
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,749
Speaker 0: But basically you only use that in an extreme emergency.

240
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, because their interest rates like 40% It's a bad idea.

241
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:59,650
Speaker 0: But basically remember they used to send you checks fake checks and well not fake checks But like real checks that you could just write to people.

242
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,140
Speaker 0: that would just make a cash advance happen and fuck.

243
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:02,524
Speaker 0: Yeah,

244
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:29,531
Speaker 1: cash advances were bad news but old people could do that if they wanted to and the way it would work is your credit card whether you know it or not has a pin and if you have to put that pin in and it basically acts like a debit card the point I'm Making here is that America relatively recently started forcing everyone to use chips instead of the mag stripes But this was ostensibly for security But they didn't actually implement the pin part of that.

245
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:32,080
Speaker 0: They're basically just using the chip instead of the magnet strip.

246
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,027
Speaker 0: Yes, so the same fucking thing.

247
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:41,317
Speaker 1: It's not actually in any way more secure And in fact credit card fraud appears to have not dropped at all.

248
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:48,340
Speaker 1: Nope And even funnier a lot of Americans who don't travel like in Europe as much as I do.

249
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:59,067
Speaker 1: We'll go to Europe and try to use their credit card And guess what your American credit card even though it has a chip won't fucking work in almost any point-of-sale System that doesn't have a human there.

250
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:02,900
Speaker 0: like most things the government does that are anti common sense.

251
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:14,816
Speaker 0: it's usually because someone is paying the Representatives to go against common sense and it's like a lot of the times It's just plain old visible like oh, yeah, that oil company is paying them to deny climate change?

252
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:15,860
Speaker 0: obviously, right?

253
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:17,769
Speaker 0: But in this case, it's criminals.

254
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,580
Speaker 0: So that's the ones that they don't make so obvious.

255
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:28,816
Speaker 0: But I'm pretty sure I'll be willing to bet that credit card fraud Profiteers are definitely paying to make sure the US does not implement chip and pin.

256
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,040
Speaker 1: I don't know who's paying to me.

257
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:37,294
Speaker 0: I think that sounds like a crazy conspiracy But you know what less crazy than actual crazy conspiracies the crazy people believe, you know, I'd suspect more.

258
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:41,426
Speaker 1: all the companies that issue Credit cards in the u.s.

259
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:43,695
Speaker 1: Don't want to have to update their systems because you have to.

260
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:45,120
Speaker 0: they already just updated them.

261
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:49,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, and half the places I go in New York still use the mag swipe.

262
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:51,067
Speaker 0: So only the only place.

263
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:55,098
Speaker 0: I actually saw the mag swipe even though I was just talking good about them for letting me use my Apple.

264
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,680
Speaker 0: If you want to buy know if you want to buy food at Madison Square Garden.

265
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:01,928
Speaker 0: All the chip inserts are broken you or something.

266
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:02,831
Speaker 0: You got to use the swipe.

267
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:05,200
Speaker 0: Yep, like it's like in 19, whatever.

268
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:10,119
Speaker 1: So not only the chips basically do nothing and they're not actually the chip and pin that the rest of the world uses.

269
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:19,948
Speaker 1: the article I'm linking to here talks about how 60 million US credit cards were compromised in the last year and 93% of those were chip enabled.

270
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,898
Speaker 1: Merchants are basically just continuing to use the mag stripes because they don't give a shit.

271
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:29,000
Speaker 1: Nobody seems to give a shit about this.

272
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,462
Speaker 1: They did.

273
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:53,100
Speaker 0: what I thought happened was they changed the law so that if you were a merchant and you didn't update your assistant That you would now be liable for any, you know fraudulent like chargebacks and stuff Whereas otherwise, you know Visa MasterCard the bank or whoever would be liable and that would encourage you to Update your shit because otherwise if anything happens in those transactions your big doodoo.

274
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:58,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm not actually sure what the status of all those laws and regulations is like I just don't know.

275
00:17:58,878 --> 00:17:59,279
Speaker 0: I don't know.

276
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:14,882
Speaker 1: But the main way credit cards are getting stolen is Actually really sad and it's simply just malware on the point-of-sale systems that are all basically running windows Right.

277
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:20,720
Speaker 0: It's like you go swipe your car credit card into a Windows machine like oh that terminal thing at the FedEx place.

278
00:18:21,224 --> 00:18:22,796
Speaker 0: Someone put some spyware in it.

279
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:23,380
Speaker 0: congratulations.

280
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:27,598
Speaker 0: They can now make a copy of my credit card and go use this very telling that I have like.

281
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:34,380
Speaker 1: I have a bunch of Credit cards and I have a set of credit cards that are only ever used online and are never used in person.

282
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:35,888
Speaker 1: I have another set of credit cards.

283
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,260
Speaker 1: They're only ever used in person and never used online.

284
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:39,826
Speaker 0: I only have one credit card used for everything.

285
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:40,188
Speaker 1: Yeah.

286
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:45,640
Speaker 1: Well, I want I kept my old credit card because having that ancient line Yeah, I have two ancient credit cards with zero.

287
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:47,224
Speaker 0: Yeah I just never use.

288
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:47,665
Speaker 0: but they're not.

289
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:50,575
Speaker 0: I keep them from expiring and I just use one for everything.

290
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:59,800
Speaker 1: But anyway my Online only credit cards have to this day Never had a problem because you're not buying from any shady ass websites.

291
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,098
Speaker 0: You're buying from places with nice green locks in the corner and you know, it's the right domain.

292
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:04,981
Speaker 0: and yeah You're not.

293
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:12,999
Speaker 1: meanwhile my in-person credit card has been compromised like six times And I'm pretty sure every one of those times was the result of a shitty hotel.

294
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:17,058
Speaker 0: I got a hotel hotels in my credit card and haven't had a problem.

295
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,149
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, it was fun on a tropical island.

296
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:20,596
Speaker 0: I didn't get a problem and I used dirt everywhere.

297
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,877
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Well, I didn't want MmV.

298
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:28,438
Speaker 1: But the moral of all this is that the chips on us credit cards are you concerned about that?

299
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:29,040
Speaker 0: I'm a tropical.

300
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:30,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically mean nothing.

301
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:34,377
Speaker 0: But I checked my statement ever my balance every month and nothing shady.

302
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:35,020
Speaker 1: So you got any news?

303
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:37,525
Speaker 0: What was my news?

304
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:39,696
Speaker 1: the ridiculous fall, right?

305
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:48,960
Speaker 0: So So this is something where the core idea is a good idea and that is a phone that folds.

306
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,324
Speaker 0: We've had phones that folded.

307
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:53,071
Speaker 0: my first phone the Motorola star tag great phone.

308
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:58,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, flip phones in that area, which is great because You can fit it in your pocket.

309
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:03,940
Speaker 0: But then when you need to be bigger you unfold it and now you have a large device that's easy to use.

310
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then when you want to put it away and not use it it magically becomes smaller.

311
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:13,799
Speaker 1: The last phone I had that did that was the palm free where you can flip out the iPhone like the new iPhone X.

312
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:19,514
Speaker 0: I forget if the S or R is the bigger one But the biggest iPhone the newest biggest one is way too fucking big.

313
00:20:19,574 --> 00:20:19,956
Speaker 0: No hell.

314
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:20,940
Speaker 0: No, I wouldn't pay for it.

315
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,586
Speaker 0: Even it was like a dollar but maybe it was done But it's too damn big.

316
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:31,344
Speaker 0: But you know what if that sucker folded in half, I'd buy that right away Maybe even for like $800.

317
00:20:31,344 --> 00:20:35,415
Speaker 0: not $1,000 but $800 right cuz like damn.

318
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:37,220
Speaker 0: that would fit in my pocket if I fold it in half.

319
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:40,980
Speaker 0: But and the main thing when I unfold it, it's great.

320
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:45,778
Speaker 1: Okay, the main reason why I don't want a big phone is that I can't fit it in my pocket.

321
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,180
Speaker 0: That's right.

322
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,389
Speaker 0: That's reason number one.

323
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:48,940
Speaker 0: So folding solves all these problems.

324
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,280
Speaker 0: So there you've been working a very long time a lot of companies to make a because you can fold every part of the computer.

325
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,464
Speaker 0: We have laptops that fold.

326
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:58,853
Speaker 0: No, the problem is we have a phone.

327
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:00,880
Speaker 0: the part that can't fold is the screen.

328
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:03,955
Speaker 1: That's the only part that needs to be big for most people.

329
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:04,920
Speaker 1: that are the battery, right?

330
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:11,979
Speaker 0: So I mean we can make a folding phone where the screens on half of it like a laptop Blackberry with a hinge in the middle.

331
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:14,609
Speaker 0: Fuck that garbage, right?

332
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:17,280
Speaker 0: We need to make the screen itself somehow fold.

333
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,000
Speaker 0: We don't want to have like a DS where there's two screens with a blank space in the middle.

334
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got to make the screen itself fold.

335
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,260
Speaker 0: So they've been working on this technology for a long time and Samsung has apparently succeeded.

336
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:34,520
Speaker 0: They want to make this phone and this phone Looks like fucking even worse than iPhone one.

337
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,052
Speaker 0: It is way thick and chunky way janky.

338
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:42,086
Speaker 0: the most telling the rumor is that they want to charge $1,700 for this.

339
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,773
Speaker 1: someone zoomed in on how thick it is.

340
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:45,540
Speaker 1: Like he's holding it in his hand when it's folded.

341
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:48,614
Speaker 0: It's so thick that I can't say this.

342
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:49,780
Speaker 0: It's like a ham sandwich.

343
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,013
Speaker 1: I have eaten sandwiches that were thinner than this fucking phone based on this pay.

344
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,719
Speaker 0: At least it's smaller than a de bella sandwich.

345
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:58,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really wanted to be able to sandwich right now.

346
00:21:58,736 --> 00:22:01,244
Speaker 1: Oh my god I'm hungry already.

347
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:03,131
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll pick up a bread and some stuff.

348
00:22:03,151 --> 00:22:04,134
Speaker 0: You said those words.

349
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:07,206
Speaker 1: Anyway, a Primal part of my I'm selling.

350
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,135
Speaker 1: I'm literally salivating now same.

351
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,380
Speaker 1: Okay, so The point is I can't get in New York.

352
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:15,180
Speaker 1: I'm rich and I live in New York and I can't get a goddamn de bella sandwich.

353
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,251
Speaker 0: I could go to that other place in a story people talk about anyway.

354
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:18,452
Speaker 0: Yeah.

355
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:20,780
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is this phone is garbage.

356
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:23,708
Speaker 0: No one's paying $700 for this, but I cannot.

357
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:29,647
Speaker 1: I cannot wait if my current phone could fold over Forward and turn into a tiny square.

358
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:30,370
Speaker 1: That's one thing.

359
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:32,960
Speaker 1: This is like if my phone were just twice as big.

360
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:37,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm hoping that the squid is basically square aspect ratio.

361
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,182
Speaker 1: What the hell.

362
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:54,076
Speaker 0: the fact that they have succeeded at this though means I'm really hoping that in 5-ish plus years right when Apple makes the folding phone That I have awesome thin as hell folding phone and I'll buy the second generation of folding phone.

363
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:54,939
Speaker 0: It'll be sweet as hell.

364
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:56,451
Speaker 1: Here's my problem.

365
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:57,319
Speaker 1: I know what's gonna happen.

366
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:05,544
Speaker 1: the folding phones are going to be in their folded state still too big because the market for this is people who Way to be.

367
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:13,670
Speaker 0: if I wait for the second generation of folding Apple phone, it will not be too big But then it'll get too big in the later versions and I'll keep that one.

368
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,549
Speaker 0: So I'll stick with the iPhone f7.

369
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,006
Speaker 1: It's just look at this screen like who needs a screen That's just wider like that like at the thing.

370
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:30,659
Speaker 0: Okay, so if this thing wasn't thick if it was nice and thin Okay, then it would actually be okay because what you wouldn't have a tablet it would be your phone and your tablet.

371
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:33,098
Speaker 0: true but This thing and that's it.

372
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,198
Speaker 1: Most people who want a big phone seem to want it so that they can watch like movies on it.

373
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:40,228
Speaker 0: even at $1,700 it's cheaper than a phone and a tablet.

374
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:43,218
Speaker 1: what I don't see here is what the actual resolution is of this screen.

375
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:47,034
Speaker 0: not good Enough because I mean it doesn't say you gotta have to wait for it to be good enough.

376
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:47,898
Speaker 1: It's obviously okay.

377
00:23:48,622 --> 00:23:50,959
Speaker 1: So it is a cow good God.

378
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:56,453
Speaker 1: Okay, Samsung fold is a tiny 4.6 display with a 19 blah blah blah.

379
00:23:56,713 --> 00:24:00,923
Speaker 1: the unfolded mode is a 7.3 inch 2152 by 1536. that's okay.

380
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:01,988
Speaker 1: That's alright.

381
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:02,912
Speaker 0: That's okay.

382
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:11,280
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I'm actually Surprised that they're going with this instead of waiting one more generation.

383
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:13,832
Speaker 0: I think they have to push it out to make it.

384
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,600
Speaker 0: you know, there's always that first right?

385
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember before the iPhone there was that Motorola iTunes phone.

386
00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:23,460
Speaker 0: Remember that thing right at all, right?

387
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,760
Speaker 0: So there's always has to be the one janky piece of crap before the first real thing.

388
00:24:28,442 --> 00:24:31,795
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna link to this article for my last news cuz it's on Forbes.

389
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:35,060
Speaker 1: and if you don't know the deal with Forbes There's a reason why it used to be a magazine.

390
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,239
Speaker 0: That was a real magazine even though the guy who runs it is like a piece of shit The guy named Forbes.

391
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,943
Speaker 0: But Forbes.

392
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:46,680
Speaker 0: now you use a website used to be a website based on the magazine with real articles like a real magazine.

393
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:57,787
Speaker 0: But now basically anyone can write a Forbes article almost and then whoever writes the article will go around trying to post it everywhere on the internet because they get paid to the end more clicks and stuff and So just cuz something's on Forbes.

394
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:01,044
Speaker 0: it sort of lends it this credibility of being in a real Magazine.

395
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:03,479
Speaker 1: mostly cuz and I run into a lot of people who don't know.

396
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,334
Speaker 0: Change their business may as well just be a fucking blog if it's on Forbes.

397
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:08,860
Speaker 0: It might as well be a medium post.

398
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:09,577
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

399
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:17,102
Speaker 1: Yep So I'm not even gonna say the name of the company because it's clearly an ad for a company that does delivery services within cities.

400
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:20,979
Speaker 1: but the point it makes and like the data talks about is pretty interesting.

401
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:25,452
Speaker 0: if True, it's not just cherry-pick data to support that company's business model.

402
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:38,384
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point it makes is that in most major cities Transit is where though like bicycles are literally the fastest and most reliable way to get around Almost any major city.

403
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:41,252
Speaker 1: that is true, which is 100% true in my experience.

404
00:25:41,593 --> 00:25:53,314
Speaker 1: like the state if I'm going to fall Faster than walking you cannot walk faster than it is faster than taking the subway Even if I'm going like way out into Brooklyn from here depending on the distance, right?

405
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:55,240
Speaker 0: So it's like an ultra long distance.

406
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,060
Speaker 0: No, it's not faster.

407
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:59,849
Speaker 0: Yeah Like I can and it also depends on where you're going cuz.

408
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:11,180
Speaker 0: sometimes if I go into somewhere like if I go to Brooklyn the subway To Brooklyn is either like three transfers and a G. Yeah, and then versus a straight shot I was like I can basically taking a super shortcut with the bicycle.

409
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,980
Speaker 0: We're like the train would have to go way fast to go into Manhattan.

410
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,240
Speaker 1: We'll come back or even like far Rockaway It takes about the same amount of time to bike there as it does to take the subway there.

411
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,572
Speaker 0: Well, there's the subway to get to.

412
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,322
Speaker 0: there is very far Rock away.

413
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:26,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's far Rockaway.

414
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,939
Speaker 0: It's named that because it's farther than regular Rockaway.

415
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:32,511
Speaker 0: Yep It's not named that for any other reason.

416
00:26:32,552 --> 00:26:34,120
Speaker 0: It's actually talking about the distance.

417
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:35,685
Speaker 1: It's far but it's something.

418
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:40,000
Speaker 1: just think about that stat because a lot of people isn't gig knives don't necessarily live in cities.

419
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:52,040
Speaker 1: But the fact that if you have to rank the ways to get around the city in terms of how efficient and fast they actually Are everyone knows I mean, it's was proven a long time ago that a bicycle is the most efficient form of transportation period.

420
00:26:52,168 --> 00:27:00,300
Speaker 1: Yeah ever conceived in terms of energy per Going again until you get to long like very long distances or you like use cases and all this nonsense.

421
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:04,611
Speaker 0: I mean if there was friction in space You could use a bike but

422
00:27:04,631 --> 00:27:30,479
Speaker 1: there is some economic Evidence of this to like a secondary set of evidence in the sense that I'm not again I won't say the name of the company in this article But pretty much all the deliveries in New York City, like even deliveries of kind of big stuff like anything It isn't UPS FedEx is coming to buy a bike like bike messengers have Exploded again to the point that like there's a million of these bikes around the city both electric and not electric.

423
00:27:31,642 --> 00:27:40,980
Speaker 0: And then the only reason the UPS FedEx doesn't use say cargo bikes To deploy like all the packages small enough to go on a cargo bike is because they would need so many riders.

424
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:45,716
Speaker 0: They use money even though each individual package will be delivered more energy efficiently.

425
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:46,920
Speaker 0: Yes more speedily.

426
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:48,246
Speaker 1: So just something to think about.

427
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,392
Speaker 1: there's a reason why people there

428
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:52,265
Speaker 0: are places where they do use bikes though Like you know UPS and whatnot

429
00:27:52,486 --> 00:28:05,899
Speaker 1: plus now that New York like the city bikes in New York have been such a big success that They're like they are such an important part of the transit system in the daily commute now that like a city bike outage is Almost as bad as certain kinds of subway outages in certain neighborhoods.

430
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,173
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

431
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,647
Speaker 1: so I Big Clive.

432
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:27,320
Speaker 1: calm is a pretty great YouTube channel I've linked to occasionally where he'll basically buy like dodgy ass Chinese bootleg electronics on eBay and take it apart and explain why it's so dangerous and terrifying.

433
00:28:27,882 --> 00:28:36,644
Speaker 1: but his channel is great and he goes into all this stuff, but this one is pretty unique because I had never conceived that such an item existed.

434
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,449
Speaker 1: and apparently these are commonly used outside of the United States.

435
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:48,366
Speaker 1: and Essentially this device even if it works as intended is Terrifyingly dangerous.

436
00:28:48,968 --> 00:29:01,142
Speaker 1: It is a USB flesh-burning pen for ladies Mm-hmm, and what it is used for is to use high voltage burning for people to burn moles off of Themselves.

437
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:04,054
Speaker 0: Oh, I could use that or burn skin tags off.

438
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:04,576
Speaker 1: Basically.

439
00:29:04,596 --> 00:29:05,359
Speaker 0: I have a mole.

440
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:06,564
Speaker 1: Yes so you can buy this.

441
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:13,631
Speaker 1: you could buy this thing on eBay and even that expensive charge you with USB and Burn the shit out of yourself.

442
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,536
Speaker 0: Isn't that fucking hurt?

443
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:16,165
Speaker 0: Yes I'm not gonna do it.

444
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:18,600
Speaker 1: then and this video is great because he just he.

445
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:21,240
Speaker 0: Can I use it to burn a mole off of you?

446
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:28,558
Speaker 0: No, so just the fact that this is a consumer item then I get all the fun of mole removal without the pain fire.

447
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:46,099
Speaker 1: Yeah It even comes with dire warnings about not to use it on like areas of skin larger than a certain amount and the area that they mention as being the line between safe and not safe is In my personal opinion way too big of an area to burn yourself on purpose

448
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:47,464
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

449
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:52,320
Speaker 1: so and the funniest part is the thing doesn't even actually work and it keeps crashing

450
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,623
Speaker 0: crashing

451
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:54,487
Speaker 1: cuz it's just.

452
00:29:54,889 --> 00:30:01,732
Speaker 1: it's a Chinese like bootleg piece of shit and Even if it works, it's intended to burn you with an electrified needle.

453
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:04,480
Speaker 0: Can you just use a wood-burning laser or something?

454
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,360
Speaker 1: Uh, no, this burns a different way laser cutter videos like 15 minutes long.

455
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,855
Speaker 1: You can watch it and see all the detail.

456
00:30:09,915 --> 00:30:15,480
Speaker 1: but warning He uses it to burn a callus off of his hand because he wants to see how it works.

457
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,116
Speaker 0: Why don't you use it to just burn a piece of wood?

458
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,739
Speaker 1: I could do that, too.

459
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:22,264
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

460
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:28,751
Speaker 0: so here's a Twitter account story board art B O R E D like you're bored, but it's all one word.

461
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:29,514
Speaker 0: Oh cute.

462
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,020
Speaker 0: It's some animator of some kind.

463
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:34,060
Speaker 0: I don't know who this person is because someone retweeted them.

464
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,952
Speaker 0: I think if they're a bad person, which it doesn't.

465
00:30:35,972 --> 00:30:37,362
Speaker 0: they don't appear to be because you know Anyone.

466
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,854
Speaker 0: it's what it could always be a bad person, right?

467
00:30:38,955 --> 00:30:43,950
Speaker 0: I've occasionally Oh cute Nintendo comic oh a Nazi made.

468
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:46,600
Speaker 1: that's the exact what I was thinking of that fucking Nintendo comic.

469
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,294
Speaker 0: Anyway, this person doesn't appear to be a bad person and they're an animator artist of some kind.

470
00:30:51,374 --> 00:30:53,280
Speaker 0: and here is the tweet art thread.

471
00:30:53,421 --> 00:30:56,393
Speaker 0: My ten-year-old brother wrote a kid's book and I drew the pictures for it.

472
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:58,000
Speaker 0: It's like an ex-cop store here, right?

473
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,440
Speaker 0: It turned out so funny that we're actually gonna get it made into physical books for us and some friends.

474
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,825
Speaker 0: So not for you listeners.

475
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:05,109
Speaker 0: Here's the full thing.

476
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,120
Speaker 0: So on Twitter, it's how many posts is this?

477
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,201
Speaker 0: 123?

478
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,406
Speaker 1: oh, this is really good.

479
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:11,209
Speaker 0: six seven.

480
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:20,720
Speaker 0: There are seven tweets in a thread and each one has Four pictures except for the last one which only has two pictures and you just go through the pictures one by one.

481
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,940
Speaker 0: And that's the whole children's storybook.

482
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,020
Speaker 0: That is very well illustrated and it appears to be colored in by someone who's using crayon.

483
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,495
Speaker 0: But it's also really good at crayon or making a Photoshop bar brush.

484
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:36,168
Speaker 0: that looks exactly like a crayon And it's an excellent children's book.

485
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:37,613
Speaker 0: it's not on the level of.

486
00:31:37,673 --> 00:31:47,106
Speaker 0: I want my hat back but it is Excellent and entertaining for all ages even if you are 90 or 9 so cute In the meta moment.

487
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:50,566
Speaker 1: the book club book is Space Odyssey 2001 the book.

488
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:53,369
Speaker 1: We'll read it soon.

489
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:54,600
Speaker 1: We're also gonna be live.

490
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:59,360
Speaker 0: I noticed the other day that you know, cuz that the filmstruck websites going down, but it's not down yet.

491
00:31:59,763 --> 00:32:02,803
Speaker 0: it's here till later in the month and 2010 was on there.

492
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:05,311
Speaker 0: So I didn't visit Europa.

493
00:32:05,331 --> 00:32:06,153
Speaker 0: cuz I follow instructions.

494
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:08,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the one rule.

495
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:13,500
Speaker 1: Also, we will be live at Pax unplugged doing learn and win Puerto Rico.

496
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:20,095
Speaker 1: I just mostly finished these slides for that and All I will say is the production values are off the charts.

497
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:20,960
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a great panel.

498
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,607
Speaker 0: You did not do the strategy section.

499
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:23,812
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.

500
00:32:23,832 --> 00:32:25,640
Speaker 0: I also made some edits in your rule section.

501
00:32:26,002 --> 00:32:28,236
Speaker 1: I wish I well, I'll look at them see what you misspelled.

502
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:28,760
Speaker 0: governor.

503
00:32:29,942 --> 00:32:35,020
Speaker 1: You wrote governor and not govern or over though I was copy pasting a lot out of a thing cuz I was in a hurry.

504
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:37,626
Speaker 0: Some other things also.

505
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:43,104
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also I found a rules clarification That we had.

506
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:45,472
Speaker 1: we never knew about this rule.

507
00:32:45,854 --> 00:32:46,436
Speaker 0: What rule is?

508
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:51,197
Speaker 1: oh, I'll share it later And we've never followed it, but I'm confident it never came up.

509
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:51,759
Speaker 1: Okay?

510
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,547
Speaker 1: So it's one of those situations But that'll be good.

511
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:56,391
Speaker 1: this will be a good panel.

512
00:32:56,693 --> 00:32:58,280
Speaker 1: and then also the 40 tabletop games.

513
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,040
Speaker 1: You must play the advanced version for the tabletop con where you can assume the people know the biz.

514
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:04,386
Speaker 1: So this be a good time.

515
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:05,551
Speaker 1: also packs out.

516
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:06,556
Speaker 1: this coming up packs.

517
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:07,360
Speaker 1: The East is coming up.

518
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:09,668
Speaker 1: I wonder if the packs these badges are sold out yet.

519
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:12,780
Speaker 1: That's a good question cuz Saturday's sold the fuck out.

520
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:16,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've already went on sale and no only Saturday sold out.

521
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:19,051
Speaker 0: Oh days are very available for PAX East.

522
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,180
Speaker 0: if you want hotels might not be available.

523
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:28,319
Speaker 0: But if you want to go to PAX East and on any day but Saturday you can just go and you can maybe get a Saturday badge in the secondary market or something.

524
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,680
Speaker 1: and Enforcer applications for PAX East are live.

525
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:37,399
Speaker 1: So if you didn't know East is the con that like me and Scott enforce we're there.

526
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,007
Speaker 1: Enforce the night shift every year.

527
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:39,752
Speaker 0: It's not enforcing it.

528
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:41,179
Speaker 0: East kind of makes East way shittier.

529
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:44,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, East I mean East is great, but it is the worst PAX.

530
00:33:44,784 --> 00:33:50,864
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I'm saying, you know I often talk about things being like the least smelly poop and that's when everything sucks But this thing sucks a little less.

531
00:33:51,506 --> 00:33:54,275
Speaker 0: East is like a scratched up piece of platinum.

532
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:54,696
Speaker 0: It's like.

533
00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:58,435
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like okay It's not the most delicious steak.

534
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:01,292
Speaker 0: It's the Second most delicious.

535
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:01,554
Speaker 0: Yeah.

536
00:34:01,855 --> 00:34:07,880
Speaker 1: Oh, no It's like I got a platinum piece a gold piece and then East is like the electron piece like that's still worth something.

537
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:09,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's still great.

538
00:34:09,344 --> 00:34:10,367
Speaker 1: This is still great.

539
00:34:10,387 --> 00:34:10,788
Speaker 0: It's just.

540
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:19,337
Speaker 0: it's slightly imperfect compared to the other greats, especially because oh, no I only got a Donatello piece of artwork and not a Van.

541
00:34:19,397 --> 00:34:19,819
Speaker 0: Gogh.

542
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:24,393
Speaker 1: I mean, honestly, the only problems with PAX East are one Boston.

543
00:34:24,413 --> 00:34:26,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Boston doesn't have enough hotels.

544
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,203
Speaker 0: It's cold.

545
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,980
Speaker 1: It's it's cold in Boston doesn't have enough transit.

546
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,748
Speaker 0: The building is a big rectangle.

547
00:34:32,828 --> 00:34:37,159
Speaker 1: actually literally every problem with PAX East is the direct fault of the city of Boston and not PAX.

548
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:42,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, like 100% so But it's still fun and we'll be there.

549
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:42,733
Speaker 1: It's gonna be awesome.

550
00:34:42,934 --> 00:34:43,054
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

551
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:49,880
Speaker 1: So, yeah, we were trying to give up with the Monday shows we do and I realize we almost just did a show on printing.

552
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:56,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like we might be able to do something on that maybe but yeah So Monday show ideas are hard to come up with.

553
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:57,268
Speaker 0: those two reasons right.

554
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:03,369
Speaker 0: reason number one is that we're not really learning Technologies, it's not like, you know to do a show.

555
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:05,880
Speaker 0: It's like we could just read Wikipedia to you, but that's stupid.

556
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:10,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need to know something so that we can talk about it for 20 30 whatever minutes.

557
00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:12,191
Speaker 1: Another like minor problem.

558
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:18,760
Speaker 0: We don't learn new Technologies that much and there aren't new ones to learn that often and we do these two shows like every other week.

559
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,820
Speaker 0: It's like I'm not learning a new technology every other week that I can talk for 20 minutes in depth about.

560
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,681
Speaker 1: Well, also that like my areas of expertise have changed quite a bit based on the work I'm doing.

561
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:32,535
Speaker 1: like for example, there's new there's a couple of new routing protocols and what's a new?

562
00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:34,361
Speaker 1: I mean from like 2012 2013.

563
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:35,871
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not working in routing them.

564
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:37,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't configure.

565
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:47,699
Speaker 1: So while I know what those routing protocols do on a high level I Could I sell like OSPF where I can like start drawing the details right now for you?

566
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:54,601
Speaker 1: And if I tell you what I know about these new routing protocols that you will learn less than you would learn from Wikipedia about Them.

567
00:35:55,104 --> 00:36:03,454
Speaker 1: Yep, like there's even a there's even a new now Non-routable range in IPv4 for a specific kind of net right and things.

568
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:09,960
Speaker 0: some things I do learn are so incredibly Specific and narrow that they're not really appropriate for a podcast for the audience.

569
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:19,986
Speaker 0: That's you know, not someone like I could talk about like a specific Function in a specific library and it's like anyone who's not using that library doesn't give any shits It's not it's not.

570
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:21,936
Speaker 0: so y'all talk about right and also like.

571
00:36:22,077 --> 00:36:31,899
Speaker 1: at this point I am so far removed from the code my own engineers Right that I work on a very high business oriented level.

572
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,168
Speaker 1: now Is one not interesting?

573
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:35,152
Speaker 1: most of you and two.

574
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:37,903
Speaker 1: I can't talk about what I'm doing Like.

575
00:36:37,943 --> 00:36:38,927
Speaker 1: I can't just talk about it.

576
00:36:39,027 --> 00:37:03,880
Speaker 0: second reason is hard to come with Monday episodes is because even though Technological change is moving at a more rapid pace than at any point in history right in terms of actual computers consumer electronics these sorts of things developments have that are that are significant and meaningful and Episode worthy have decreased significantly in recent history.

577
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,203
Speaker 0: Well,

578
00:37:04,445 --> 00:37:21,459
Speaker 1: there's like the 20 outs to that though like number one a lot of the things we would previously have talked about on a Monday show around technology in The modern era much more appropriately fit in like a Thursday show Because it's more about the society around the use of the technology and we've started to make that distinction more often than we used to.

579
00:37:22,363 --> 00:37:40,240
Speaker 1: Another part of it is that a lot of the advances in technology While they are Transformative to like like cell phones like battery technology and all that and while they are moving pretty quick The gains from those are being basically eaten by other evolving aspects of technology like batteries got bigger.

580
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:48,011
Speaker 0: But also we're doing more with the devices of batteries don't actually last long right and it's like if a lot of the improvements to Something it's like okay something was made faster.

581
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:48,593
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

582
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:51,005
Speaker 0: Well like there's a new Wi-Fi They're telling me like Wi-Fi.

583
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:52,190
Speaker 0: They stopped using letters now.

584
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,073
Speaker 0: They were simplifying it.

585
00:37:53,093 --> 00:37:53,756
Speaker 0: They're gonna big Wi-Fi.

586
00:37:53,776 --> 00:37:53,837
Speaker 0: v6.

587
00:37:53,877 --> 00:37:59,100
Speaker 1: dude You know 211 G is still like literally fast enough for everything I do in my house, right?

588
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,300
Speaker 0: But the point is is like I don't know what the differences between them are only that they're faster.

589
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:04,244
Speaker 0: It's still Wi-Fi.

590
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:05,850
Speaker 0: You don't notice any difference as a user.

591
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,436
Speaker 0: You don't know which one you're using.

592
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:14,700
Speaker 1: there are Some differences around how the signals interact such that you can have more density of access points and signals.

593
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,257
Speaker 0: How can you possibly get a geek nights episode out of all that?

594
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:17,640
Speaker 1: well?

595
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,466
Speaker 0: Well because again Wi-Fi is now faster.

596
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:24,809
Speaker 0: if you get a newer router and a new enough device and somehow they link up Well, here's it, but it's way.

597
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:26,940
Speaker 0: It's faster than your internet connection is you won't notice.

598
00:38:27,342 --> 00:38:27,804
Speaker 1: Well, that's it.

599
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:36,277
Speaker 1: the impact of a lot of the fast-moving technology impacts like like it's multiple steps removed from the consumer use case.

600
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:45,979
Speaker 1: like ISPs will benefit from some of these changes, but you using your phone connecting to a Wi-Fi at home There is literally no meaningful difference to you for the foreseeable future.

601
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:48,891
Speaker 1: Cuz look strip live streaming six megabit up.

602
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:51,000
Speaker 1: That's all I need to live stream to YouTube.

603
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,185
Speaker 1: They won't even take more than that.

604
00:38:52,426 --> 00:38:53,732
Speaker 1: yep at least for what I'm doing.

605
00:38:54,174 --> 00:38:55,360
Speaker 0: mm-hmm also.

606
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:57,288
Speaker 0: Even you know they used to be this thing.

607
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:05,920
Speaker 0: Moore's law where they were like okay every two years Transistor density will double right and it's like well actually we're sort of slower than that.

608
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:10,404
Speaker 0: It's more like three years at this point And it we're not seeing.

609
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:16,700
Speaker 0: even even things getting faster are not getting faster as fast as they were five six seven years ago.

610
00:39:17,242 --> 00:39:21,157
Speaker 0: Intel specifically who's like is number one in terms of consumer chips.

611
00:39:21,217 --> 00:39:38,536
Speaker 0: still kinda They've been working on this 10 nanometer Process which means the transistors are 10 nanometers in size supposedly And they sort of have fucked that up repeatedly and evisced all the deadlines And it was supposed to be out this year and this year's almost over now.

612
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:46,336
Speaker 0: They're saying next year There's a rumor that they're just gonna cancel the whole fucking thing and Intel's like no no no This is why they're in trouble right now.

613
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:55,988
Speaker 0: well There's and that's why you see things like Apple and Nvidia really gaining on them Apple making its own chips for a lot of its machines and and devices Nvidia maybe making a CPU.

614
00:39:56,029 --> 00:40:00,207
Speaker 0: yeah, they haven't officially announced that but well I can see it coming.

615
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:02,040
Speaker 1: there's another sort of subtle thing going on.

616
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:18,494
Speaker 1: There is that when we were talking a lot about computers one like we're buying a lot more consumer like computer shit and building computers more often but to the metrics of Performance were much more straightforward an 800 megahertz chip versus a gigahertz chip.

617
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:24,935
Speaker 1: the actual impact on your use of a computer for even simple things was Noticeable to a human.

618
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:31,780
Speaker 0: yeah You guys sit at the two different computers running the same software otherwise configured identically and one of them would be obviously faster.

619
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,346
Speaker 0: You would double-click on an application.

620
00:40:33,387 --> 00:40:35,074
Speaker 0: It would appear sooner right.

621
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:37,062
Speaker 0: you would run a game You would get.

622
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:41,378
Speaker 0: one of them would run smoothly and one of them would have lag and not have enough FPS.

623
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:41,740
Speaker 1: yep.

624
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:43,749
Speaker 1: But nowadays like my current computer.

625
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:50,980
Speaker 0: It's running at 4.5 gigahertz It's got your doors for most games even if you crank the settings up pretty high.

626
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:56,042
Speaker 0: It's like unless you got like a 4 or 5k screen and really crank it up You won't.

627
00:40:56,142 --> 00:40:59,772
Speaker 0: you'll get the full 60 frames whether you got a 1060 or a 1080 or an 1180. right forget gaming.

628
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,085
Speaker 1: Just regular PC usage.

629
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:07,960
Speaker 1: if not for the fact that I edit 4k video mm-hmm.

630
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:14,637
Speaker 1: There is literally no performance difference between my current crazy powerful computer and the one I replaced it with.

631
00:41:14,657 --> 00:41:15,900
Speaker 1: that was like five years old.

632
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,985
Speaker 1: Yep, like literally no difference.

633
00:41:18,346 --> 00:41:22,117
Speaker 1: the only thing that's ever used all this computing capability of this modern computer.

634
00:41:22,157 --> 00:41:27,716
Speaker 1: I have is Doing complex effects that can't be done in the GPU on 4k video.

635
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:35,324
Speaker 1: Like that is the only thing that uses the CPU right and even like cell phones It's even worse like.

636
00:41:36,168 --> 00:41:40,907
Speaker 1: I don't think I have noticed a performance difference in any cell phone I've bought in like six years.

637
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:42,294
Speaker 1: I literally don't even care.

638
00:41:42,354 --> 00:41:43,420
Speaker 1: What chip is in my cell phone?

639
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,706
Speaker 0: No, it used to be that like the first few iPhones.

640
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:50,780
Speaker 0: I had 3g for right noticeably kind of slow compared to the newer phones.

641
00:41:51,102 --> 00:41:56,206
Speaker 0: But once we got to six seven it's like oh actually This is just perfectly fine.

642
00:41:56,307 --> 00:41:57,390
Speaker 0: and the new phone?

643
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:00,682
Speaker 0: if I went to the Apple Store the new phone doesn't feel any faster than iPhone 7.

644
00:42:00,682 --> 00:42:02,650
Speaker 1: yep, it's the last phone.

645
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,895
Speaker 1: I had that felt slow was my?

646
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:08,950
Speaker 1: What that like LG something for like it was so long ago.

647
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:14,307
Speaker 0: It's ancient history right, so it's not just speed right It's that meaningful.

648
00:42:14,729 --> 00:42:17,279
Speaker 0: other kinds of advancements haven't really been happening.

649
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:21,196
Speaker 0: Recently in re in like the past couple two or three years right.

650
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:22,200
Speaker 0: It's like all right.

651
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:23,290
Speaker 0: We had fuck.

652
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,340
Speaker 0: like we were talking about this earlier.

653
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,349
Speaker 0: We got phones with a full screen on the front and today We still have phones with a full screen on the front.

654
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:33,380
Speaker 0: We went from not having any tablets to like here are tablets.

655
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,808
Speaker 0: They're all screen right.

656
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,883
Speaker 0: It's like what meaningful You know.

657
00:42:38,024 --> 00:42:40,451
Speaker 0: big developments are in terms of like.

658
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,660
Speaker 0: the actual features and capabilities of devices.

659
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:50,291
Speaker 0: consumer electronics and computers are Meaningfully different from how they were a few years ago.

660
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:53,120
Speaker 1: Well meaningful is complicated because that could be very contextual based.

661
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,832
Speaker 0: I would say I'd use a different word.

662
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,963
Speaker 1: I think transformative.

663
00:42:57,163 --> 00:42:57,304
Speaker 1: right.

664
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:06,611
Speaker 1: what it were the changes where as like everyone who uses the technology or a wide body of those people Fundamentally change the way they interact with that technology right.

665
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:08,620
Speaker 0: the clothes I could find is like a folding phone.

666
00:43:09,122 --> 00:43:10,489
Speaker 0: That's the closest thing I could find.

667
00:43:10,509 --> 00:43:11,092
Speaker 0: It's not.

668
00:43:11,152 --> 00:43:16,826
Speaker 0: it's not gonna be good for If it's ever good in this in the span of our like our lives.

669
00:43:16,906 --> 00:43:19,070
Speaker 1: What were the transformative technology moments like?

670
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:29,944
Speaker 0: Going well when computers suddenly had a hard drive in them instead of all these needing a floppy disk to be stopped in Pentiums like the Pentiums compared to the for having a color screen on the computer.

671
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:31,770
Speaker 0: well having a mouse that went.

672
00:43:33,173 --> 00:43:38,526
Speaker 1: The difference between a 380 we're old and a 486 like literally changed the world for me.

673
00:43:38,586 --> 00:43:42,398
Speaker 0: going from a modem to a modem That actually was fast enough to load a web page.

674
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, not a dial-up modem.

675
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:50,690
Speaker 1: Yep, Oh Computers that don't actually have good sound to a sound card that you can just buy.

676
00:43:51,011 --> 00:43:54,923
Speaker 0: Wi-Fi is now a thing and I don't have to always have some sort of wire.

677
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,210
Speaker 1: USB USB fucking changed everything.

678
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,438
Speaker 0: I remember Windows 95 support us.

679
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:01,264
Speaker 0: you have a battery you have a laptop.

680
00:44:01,284 --> 00:44:03,090
Speaker 0: you can take the computer with you somewhere.

681
00:44:03,151 --> 00:44:07,884
Speaker 0: That's not a desk Digital fucking camera.

682
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:10,202
Speaker 0: yeah We've seen a lot.

683
00:44:10,222 --> 00:44:12,294
Speaker 1: when I was in high school We had a digital camera.

684
00:44:12,314 --> 00:44:14,160
Speaker 1: the entire school share cameras.

685
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:20,942
Speaker 0: put a floppy disk in the digital camera was not the thing Until like it's actually shockingly recent like even early 2000s.

686
00:44:21,002 --> 00:44:23,550
Speaker 0: It was still film camera even though digital camera was a thing.

687
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:33,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was the kind where you put like a CD RW or a floppy disk into the camera until like you know 2003 4 or 5 maybe right you started.

688
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:37,288
Speaker 0: we had a real digital camera with compact flash card right.

689
00:44:37,328 --> 00:44:37,990
Speaker 0: that came later.

690
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:53,770
Speaker 1: But now like internet acts like broadband at least like forget access because there are parts of the world and especially because we're talking about like just sort of our experiences in America where people don't have broadband but Broadband getting faster doesn't benefit the vast majority of users of broadband.

691
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,030
Speaker 1: They're gonna use it the same way they use it today.

692
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,240
Speaker 0: But it drastically affects people who don't have broadband who suddenly need it.

693
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:01,407
Speaker 0: I read an article recently about.

694
00:45:01,547 --> 00:45:14,434
Speaker 0: I read that same article Kids who live in rural places where there's no broadband at all Can't do homework And they go to the near the school because the school has internet and they sit in like the parking lot using the school's Wi-Fi To do their homework.

695
00:45:14,554 --> 00:45:15,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fun.

696
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:16,865
Speaker 1: Let's try to step back.

697
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:17,810
Speaker 1: What was the last?

698
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:30,778
Speaker 1: technology improvement that was transformative in our lives Because I'm hard-pressed to think of anything other than like the complete sweet Modern live streaming technology like I've had.

699
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:35,390
Speaker 0: I've had the same sort of device loadout for like a significant period of time.

700
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:39,401
Speaker 1: I'm still using the same laptop from 2009 and it plays sieve 6 right?

701
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:48,330
Speaker 0: It's like I've had upgrades to devices But like what transformative change was there between my iPad pro and my mini iPad other than it's bigger and faster?

702
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,463
Speaker 0: Yeah, nothing right has a has a stylus.

703
00:45:50,483 --> 00:45:52,954
Speaker 0: stylus ain't new The like.

704
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:55,850
Speaker 1: I bought a fancy camcorder to use for gig night stuff like recently.

705
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:04,090
Speaker 0: You know a thing but 4k video is already like four years old maybe four or five years old.

706
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:09,980
Speaker 1: so the fancy camcorder I bought is Just cheaper because of like improvements in process and technology.

707
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,547
Speaker 1: It's not better than camcorders.

708
00:46:12,587 --> 00:46:13,590
Speaker 1: I've could have gotten previously.

709
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:17,370
Speaker 1: It's just cheaper and smaller, but I'm gonna use it the exact same way.

710
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:19,688
Speaker 1: I would have used one of those other ones if I could have afforded it.

711
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:34,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, Nancy the gh4 which I had not the gh5 was like basically the first prosumer Camera that had like meaningful 4k recording yeah right into video recording and it came out in.

712
00:46:36,412 --> 00:46:38,764
Speaker 1: We've been using that to record gig nights panels for a while.

713
00:46:38,784 --> 00:46:39,708
Speaker 0: Yeah a long time.

714
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:43,880
Speaker 0: 2014. yes, I was right like every four or five years right Wow 2014.

715
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,662
Speaker 0: It's only 28 May 2014.

716
00:46:44,662 --> 00:46:47,991
Speaker 0: It's 2018.

717
00:46:47,991 --> 00:47:05,483
Speaker 1: Here's what a video is four years old already But digital video cameras that just work and encode things in Reasonable formats like we tried to record some gig nights panels with that flip camera and those videos were encoded Badly to the point that you could not sink them.

718
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:06,930
Speaker 0: like GoPros are a thing now.

719
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:09,503
Speaker 0: But you know the GoPro has basically been perfect since.

720
00:47:09,523 --> 00:47:13,363
Speaker 0: like the GoPro 4. ish Yeah, I think I have the 5 is the 7 out now.

721
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:14,590
Speaker 1: Yeah a new GoPro came.

722
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:15,915
Speaker 0: I'm thinking it's not really.

723
00:47:16,035 --> 00:47:18,605
Speaker 0: I think it does 4k 60 instead of yeah 30.

724
00:47:18,605 --> 00:47:19,710
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know.

725
00:47:20,691 --> 00:47:25,478
Speaker 1: Last gen GoPro cuz I have a GoPro like g2 That I think I gave away.

726
00:47:25,498 --> 00:47:27,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the one I have if you have that one you're good.

727
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,589
Speaker 0: You don't need a newer one.

728
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, and this we only need one.

729
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:33,208
Speaker 1: cuz I need that top-down view or for doing like panel streaming and stuff like.

730
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:37,563
Speaker 0: it's like there's Been advancements in the drone department, but that's not something we can use.

731
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:37,703
Speaker 0: Well.

732
00:47:37,743 --> 00:47:38,626
Speaker 1: It's still hobbyist.

733
00:47:38,686 --> 00:47:39,690
Speaker 1: It's not transformative.

734
00:47:41,012 --> 00:47:53,405
Speaker 1: It's been a lot of drone Coupled with camera has been transformative for video and audio and like low-budget film like video Professionals a drone is like now standard equipment.

735
00:47:53,525 --> 00:47:53,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at it.

736
00:47:54,008 --> 00:47:54,350
Speaker 0: look at it.

737
00:47:54,470 --> 00:48:00,003
Speaker 0: Look at how many YouTube videos now have aerial shots overhead shots.

738
00:48:00,063 --> 00:48:02,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is transformative drone camera drones.

739
00:48:03,011 --> 00:48:04,878
Speaker 1: I will give you that is a transformative technology.

740
00:48:04,919 --> 00:48:05,039
Speaker 0: right.

741
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:10,830
Speaker 0: look how many things you watch now have like some drone footage Basically like that drone chasing the poor baby bear.

742
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:14,490
Speaker 0: Usually it's like you know scenery like to sort of set us down.

743
00:48:14,731 --> 00:48:22,829
Speaker 1: But seriously look at a tracking shot from a helicopter from the like late 80s Compared to like a drone I could buy with the cash in my desk right now.

744
00:48:23,512 --> 00:48:26,606
Speaker 0: Like seriously, I just not allowed to fly it anywhere near here.

745
00:48:26,646 --> 00:48:29,267
Speaker 0: if I lived in the woods And I would use a drone more I would get one.

746
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:33,729
Speaker 0: yeah When we went to the only reason I'm not droning is because I'm in a city and it's illegal to use it everywhere.

747
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:34,975
Speaker 0: people do It anyway, dude.

748
00:48:35,055 --> 00:48:36,724
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna mess around.

749
00:48:36,784 --> 00:48:37,488
Speaker 1: I showed up the Rangers 5k.

750
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,082
Speaker 1: Do you know many signs there are all over Flushing Corona Meadows Park.

751
00:48:41,102 --> 00:48:44,194
Speaker 1: that just says do not fucking fly our drones here We will arrest you.

752
00:48:44,294 --> 00:48:52,810
Speaker 0: there's one place that you can fly them because next to the the meadow pond There's a little area where you're allowed to fly like model plane helicopter.

753
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:57,610
Speaker 0: You can fly your drone right there in that spot because it's no different than a model plane your helicopter.

754
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:09,579
Speaker 1: Yep, I think the only other thing I can say that's been transformative is like in relative recent history we hit these sizes of Solid-state drives to where you can have just solid-state drives.

755
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:11,284
Speaker 1: and be fine the iPad that.

756
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:16,699
Speaker 0: the only reason I'm upgrading this perfectly good iPad pro is because this one has 128 gigs of storage.

757
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:27,150
Speaker 0: and even though Apple overcharges the fuck for storage because they're fucking assholes New iPad pro has an option for one terabyte of storage, which I think is enough.

758
00:49:27,614 --> 00:49:28,926
Speaker 1: I mean I have a one terabyte SSD.

759
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:33,625
Speaker 0: The SD cards that I put into my camera are 128 gig SD cards.

760
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:36,016
Speaker 0: I can't have a one.

761
00:49:36,036 --> 00:49:41,310
Speaker 0: edit those on a 128 gig iPad Need especially when a panel fills up the card.

762
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:48,114
Speaker 0: But if I had the one terabyte iPad I can now record video put it on the iPad upload and edit Which I did on this iPad.

763
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:49,579
Speaker 0: It was just very difficult.

764
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,087
Speaker 0: So the new one will now make that a possibility.

765
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:54,999
Speaker 1: No But not much.

766
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,570
Speaker 1: Oh, you know what something's gotten worse.

767
00:49:57,031 --> 00:50:02,989
Speaker 1: Cloud storage solutions for consumers are more expensive and less and more encumbered than they used to be.

768
00:50:04,372 --> 00:50:08,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, well also because the business model there was a loss leader and that doesn't scale.

769
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,678
Speaker 0: It's because you people don't back up.

770
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:13,390
Speaker 0: if you will backed up as much as they should then it would work.

771
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:17,959
Speaker 0: The other thing is that people are now The instead of paying for like what.

772
00:50:17,979 --> 00:50:18,601
Speaker 0: was that one?

773
00:50:18,863 --> 00:50:20,710
Speaker 0: the backup solution that was really popular carbon.

774
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:21,513
Speaker 0: I was that one.

775
00:50:21,534 --> 00:50:25,149
Speaker 0: that was the one that had a flat fee for like unlimited backup carbonite, right?

776
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:31,290
Speaker 0: People now don't have need carbonite because they just pay Apple like five bucks a month or Google Drive.

777
00:50:31,451 --> 00:50:32,597
Speaker 0: That's where the money's going.

778
00:50:32,617 --> 00:50:42,090
Speaker 1: Yeah for the and that's your automatic automatic back especially if you don't have a desktop computer or like a for-real laptop if you're just living in Apple or even if you do you Could they both have desktop backup solution?

779
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:46,745
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz not everyone's weird like me or I need like a 40 terabyte NAS up there for people.

780
00:50:46,845 --> 00:50:50,778
Speaker 0: most people are not backing up A huge bunch of video they record to conventions.

781
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:54,210
Speaker 0: They're just backing up their photos and their contacts and their few documents.

782
00:50:54,350 --> 00:51:02,796
Speaker 0: I think any you any one their bags any at any one pack, which is God if I did not have video to back up or Many many years of raw photos.

783
00:51:03,157 --> 00:51:06,367
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could get away with just Google Drive or just I could do

784
00:51:06,427 --> 00:51:11,602
Speaker 1: the raw wave geek nights archive Would fit on like

785
00:51:11,965 --> 00:51:12,851
Speaker 0: a USB stick Yeah,

786
00:51:12,911 --> 00:51:18,210
Speaker 1: like I could just back that I could just put that in like 20 USB sticks and just scatter them around the earth.

787
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:19,384
Speaker 1: That's my backup.

788
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:24,550
Speaker 0: Anyway Now there are some sort like in terms of soft self-driving cars.

789
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:27,350
Speaker 1: I think will be the next like really transform.

790
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:33,170
Speaker 0: We've already discussed them to death and it also the only news would be ah, they're finally being sold.

791
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:35,338
Speaker 1: Well, I think there's more to discuss.

792
00:51:35,499 --> 00:51:37,567
Speaker 0: Ah, they finally writing laws about them.

793
00:51:37,607 --> 00:51:38,290
Speaker 0: This is what they say.

794
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,597
Speaker 0: Let's discuss their finer point.

795
00:51:39,617 --> 00:51:44,532
Speaker 1: Well, also the technology isn't actually there yet It's getting.

796
00:51:44,673 --> 00:51:49,290
Speaker 0: it's getting but yeah, we've you know, I think another problem is that if you look at like software, right?

797
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,055
Speaker 0: We've sort of figured out all the algorithms.

798
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:52,821
Speaker 0: We've figured out all the methodologies.

799
00:51:53,062 --> 00:51:55,430
Speaker 0: There hasn't been a lot of movement there, right?

800
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,910
Speaker 1: There is movement and machine learning and some transformative things are happening there.

801
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,663
Speaker 1: But these are not things that are being harnessed directly by you.

802
00:52:01,945 --> 00:52:02,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

803
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,218
Speaker 1: Well some of you a lot of you doing this for your job.

804
00:52:05,238 --> 00:52:08,770
Speaker 0: There's a lot of movement in complete bullshit like blockchain nonsense.

805
00:52:08,971 --> 00:52:09,793
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

806
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:11,620
Speaker 1: God, I can't wait for those coins to just die.

807
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,222
Speaker 1: That's right.

808
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:13,968
Speaker 0: So it's like grades like.

809
00:52:14,008 --> 00:52:14,429
Speaker 0: what are we gonna do?

810
00:52:15,152 --> 00:52:16,539
Speaker 0: Nice episode about some fucking bullshit.

811
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:17,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

812
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:18,650
Speaker 0: how many bullshit technologies?

813
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:21,769
Speaker 0: I know we need real technologies to be invented for us to talk about them.

814
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:25,400
Speaker 1: Some stuff is getting close like the next gen of VR.

815
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,130
Speaker 1: that oculus go is a big step toward mass-market compatibility.

816
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:30,295
Speaker 0: It's VR.

817
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:33,430
Speaker 0: the the current gen of VR is like already been so many years.

818
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:38,374
Speaker 0: It's like it's like none of this is what was new in 2018 Oculus go.

819
00:52:38,394 --> 00:52:41,547
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying specifically like anything was new in 2018, right?

820
00:52:42,832 --> 00:52:43,659
Speaker 1: Oculus go though.

821
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:45,070
Speaker 1: That's actually a pretty was it?

822
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:48,000
Speaker 0: That's the one where it's with the battery in it.

823
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:48,643
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.

824
00:52:48,784 --> 00:52:49,769
Speaker 1: it doesn't need a computer.

825
00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:50,030
Speaker 1: It's got.

826
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:54,964
Speaker 0: It doesn't need sensors, I remember that it should have been a news when it was.

827
00:52:55,626 --> 00:52:56,188
Speaker 1: I was gonna.

828
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:57,010
Speaker 1: we should talk about it.

829
00:52:57,112 --> 00:52:58,534
Speaker 1: It's yes It's a like.

830
00:52:58,574 --> 00:52:59,840
Speaker 0: we should have talked about it when it was.

831
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:04,944
Speaker 0: how come that's actually interesting cuz I remember Seeing that news and being like, ah, and I think we had like.

832
00:53:04,964 --> 00:53:13,304
Speaker 0: I had a bunch of travel and a bunch of shit Got in our way, but then like no one else talked about it I know it like it was a news and then it's like I haven't heard from it since.

833
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:14,268
Speaker 1: cuz it's like.

834
00:53:14,288 --> 00:53:22,176
Speaker 0: I feel like that Hype train should have gone because basically edit that honestly as someone who hates all the VR and his poo-poo it That has everything going for.

835
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:26,130
Speaker 1: it's the first one that's usable by normal people without doing a bunch of bullshit in your house.

836
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:30,790
Speaker 0: It's still too damn big on your face, but everything else about it was like, whoa, great job.

837
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:36,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, like this is the kind of VR I would just buy from my mom or dad and they will not find it till smaller I'm a face.

838
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, otherwise, it's like whoa, that is a great advancement.

839
00:53:39,163 --> 00:53:39,364
Speaker 0: Great.

840
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:40,288
Speaker 0: Great idea.

841
00:53:40,328 --> 00:53:40,629
Speaker 0: Good job.

842
00:53:41,132 --> 00:53:43,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is actually huge and makes it way better.

843
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,890
Speaker 1: The only reason I'm not gonna get it is because I have the legit oculus which is better still.

844
00:53:47,111 --> 00:53:48,943
Speaker 0: I'm just waiting for it to be small enough on my face.

845
00:53:48,983 --> 00:53:52,476
Speaker 0: if they make oculus go That's doesn't stick out for my face so much.

846
00:53:52,898 --> 00:53:54,402
Speaker 1: See I don't know about sticking out from the face.

847
00:53:54,763 --> 00:53:57,490
Speaker 1: AR technology is not anywhere near there.

848
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,083
Speaker 0: Well, it's AR technology is getting very advanced.

849
00:54:00,123 --> 00:54:04,750
Speaker 0: A lot of people are investing in it, you know It's only got those animojis showrooms and controlled situations.

850
00:54:04,971 --> 00:54:06,055
Speaker 0: It's like but it's.

851
00:54:06,316 --> 00:54:09,570
Speaker 0: it's not that useful and it's like the cases where it would be useful.

852
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:11,101
Speaker 0: It's not perfect enough to be.

853
00:54:11,443 --> 00:54:18,570
Speaker 1: voice control I would argue has not been transformative at all But all the investors are desperately trying to make it transform.

854
00:54:19,832 --> 00:54:26,779
Speaker 0: I think there's certain situations where people buy the Alexa or the Google home or the Apple I home Whatever the fuck which one they have.

855
00:54:26,939 --> 00:54:29,190
Speaker 0: usually I think the Amazon was the most popular.

856
00:54:29,331 --> 00:54:32,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, people have those in their house and that's their thing.

857
00:54:33,274 --> 00:54:35,849
Speaker 0: They use it and it works right and it's good.

858
00:54:36,271 --> 00:54:37,235
Speaker 0: But I'm just.

859
00:54:37,436 --> 00:54:41,089
Speaker 0: most people I think are not in the scenario where that's a thing.

860
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:48,870
Speaker 0: It's like I have a stereo, you know It's like if I had like a room in a house that was far away from all computers or something.

861
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:49,915
Speaker 0: I might need one or so.

862
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:50,377
Speaker 0: I don't know.

863
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,950
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I I would use one in a kitchen.

864
00:54:53,231 --> 00:54:59,249
Speaker 0: But what I found is that if I kitchen was if I had a kitchen that was a separate room I was far away from all of the rooms.

865
00:54:59,651 --> 00:55:02,705
Speaker 1: But I found in practice even like trying to use all these different voice things.

866
00:55:02,745 --> 00:55:09,110
Speaker 1: They don't quite They're not intuitive enough to do the thing I actually need and it is faster to just pull out my phone and look something up.

867
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:21,624
Speaker 0: The other thing is that I just really despite and maybe it's cuz I'm old but even if no one's around I'm self-conscious about talking to a computer and Computer, please do X and it just happens.

868
00:55:21,704 --> 00:55:23,930
Speaker 0: if anyone is around I'm not talking to a computer.

869
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:30,687
Speaker 0: But I think if the computer was so intelligent like a person that then well, for example If right now I was that I wouldn't feel bad about it.

870
00:55:31,271 --> 00:55:42,910
Speaker 1: Computer said preheat the oven to 425 like while I'm sitting here, but in the current state of things I don't trust any Internet of Things to have any ability to set the temperature on anything in my apartment.

871
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:49,603
Speaker 0: If I say computer said preheat the oven to 425 and it said now preheating oven to 425 I would have to go look at the oven to make sure.

872
00:55:49,704 --> 00:55:50,569
Speaker 1: yeah, I wouldn't trust it.

873
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:55,670
Speaker 1: I also I don't want to be slain in the middle of the night and suddenly here off in the distance.

874
00:55:56,071 --> 00:56:00,029
Speaker 1: It's preheating oven to 550 because someone hacked into my apartments trying to kill me.

875
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:04,239
Speaker 1: So, yeah that killed an episode.

876
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:06,970
Speaker 0: I think right but we need ideas for the next Monday episode.

877

Speaker 1: Tell us what we should do the Monday show on.

878
00:56:08,758 --> 00:56:14,439
Speaker 0: please invent something new or Find something that I actually have a reason to learn.

879
00:56:14,479 --> 00:56:17,369
Speaker 0: that is a significant item that I could talk about for 30 minutes.

880
