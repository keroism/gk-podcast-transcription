Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:33,757
Speaker 1: I Felt like I had to do the opener a little different because I realized last time we did a Wednesday show was early May.

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:43,479
Speaker 1: It's late June and that show we basically just talked about anime everyone forgot about and kind of a ad-hoc crab people fashion.

9
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:46,370
Speaker 0: Well, I think we're gonna.

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,940
Speaker 0: I think we're getting some show ideas.

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,240
Speaker 0: So we're gonna have a period of time here where the the getting is good.

12
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,769
Speaker 1: Getting is getting better before this.

13
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,043
Speaker 0: I'm sure there'll be a doldrums after it, but for now It's goodening.

14
00:00:58,465 --> 00:00:59,669
Speaker 0: We came up with a Monday show.

15
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,860

23
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, we actually have never done a fist of the North Star show ever.

24
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:24,360
Speaker 1: I feel like we could do it.

25
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:25,609
Speaker 1: It might be time to do it.

26
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:26,919
Speaker 0: It's always time.

27
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:28,173

30
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:36,687
Speaker 1: but it's warm today.

00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:46,651
Speaker 0: It has nothing to do with the hippies who bomb shit underground.

34
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:46,917
Speaker 0: calm.

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,340
Speaker 0: They basically take data from civilian, and I don't know if they take data from other weather stations.

36
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:56,920
Speaker 0: Take data from weather stations, and it's like a open-source weather website.

37
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:00,095
Speaker 0: According to this the weather where we are right now.

38
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:08,348
Speaker 0: It is currently 97.3 degrees Fahrenheit, and it says it feels like 105 in Celsius for you foreign peoples.

39
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,421
Speaker 0: I'm clicking the Celsius which right because you can't do it in your head Can you?

40
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:12,404
Speaker 0: that's right.

41
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:16,154
Speaker 0: it is 36.3 and feels like 40. it is so awesome.

42
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:18,319
Speaker 1: I would like it to be a little warmer.

43
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:20,675
Speaker 0: Well I mean the thing is right.

44
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:24,151
Speaker 0: when I'm biking This is the tiniest bit of chilliness.

45
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:27,978
Speaker 0: if I'm if you're moving fast, but other than that It's warm.

46
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty much taking this granted.

47
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:37,100
Speaker 1: to be fair the only time in my life I've ever not had air conditioning in my primary residence was when we were at RIT in Rochester.

48
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:40,270
Speaker 0: Didn't really matter her air conditioning.

49
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:40,813
Speaker 0: No we didn't.

50
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,500
Speaker 0: I guess not how well.

51
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,948
Speaker 1: Why would you think that we had air conditioning?

52
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:48,400
Speaker 1: trying to remember we schemed about having air conditioning in the winter?

53
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:52,277
Speaker 1: Because it got dank we left the window open all the time.

54
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:56,764
Speaker 0: anyway there is Is something.

55
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:57,847
Speaker 1: you got something to say.

56
00:02:57,867 --> 00:02:59,653
Speaker 1: you got nothing I forgot.

57
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,960
Speaker 0: so oh, I just gonna say the thing.

58
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,765
Speaker 0: I've been the comment.

59
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:05,359
Speaker 0: I've been making all day repeatedly, which I won't make after today.

60
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:07,473
Speaker 0: cuz No, cuz I'm not rim.

61
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:08,037
Speaker 0: It's a long day.

62
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,206
Speaker 0: I like how when you open the door to the outside and you if you closed your you already told me that yeah But I didn't tell you on the show.

63
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:17,891
Speaker 1: Uh you've already said that anecdote though I know you can't tell it to another.

64
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:22,197
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say it ever again But you've you already said it twice, but when you open the door to the outside.

65
00:03:22,257 --> 00:03:32,610
Speaker 0: It feels like How's it feel I kind of want to bring some pizza outside just to kind of let it cook And then we could go cook an egg on the asphalt.

66
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,334
Speaker 1: I've done that before.

67
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:34,540
Speaker 0: you need a magnifying glass.

68
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:35,788
Speaker 0: No, you don't need no.

69
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,297
Speaker 1: just cracking egg on the asphalt was hot enough.

70
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:37,740
Speaker 1: It just cooks.

71
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:38,966
Speaker 0: I don't think it's hot enough right now.

72
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:40,534
Speaker 0: also the egg would be mad dirty.

73
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now you don't eat it You just cook it.

74
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:48,498
Speaker 0: then you leave it there for someone to find me like what the thing is if you put on someone if you Clean a windshield off and use that then you'll be able to eat that.

75
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:52,259
Speaker 1: True a windshield or a hood of a car?

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, hood of a car.

77
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:59,618
Speaker 1: cuz I was gonna say windshield probably not the hottest thing in the world It'd be pretty hot not as hot as the hood of the car anyway.

78
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,685
Speaker 1: anyway Let's send this fascinating conversation.

79
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:02,688
Speaker 0: so car black car.

80
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:06,740
Speaker 1: I went to see a cat in Paris with Emily at the Angelica.

81
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,079
Speaker 0: I went all the way to Paris.

82
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were commas in that sentence.

83
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:11,792
Speaker 0: how many.

84
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:13,420
Speaker 0: I didn't mean there must be a lot of cats in Paris.

85
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:20,640
Speaker 1: There's just one apparently okay, and there were some some other cats in the opening bit, but no it's a French animation.

86
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:22,125
Speaker 1: What was interesting?

87
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:31,018
Speaker 1: I saw the dub, and it was dubbed by none other than our friend Sinter Nicklaus Okay, and the main character was played by none other than mr.. Bloom.

88
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:33,269
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Spike Spiegel.

89
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,400
Speaker 1: all right the dub was fine.

90
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:41,680
Speaker 1: I don't know how it compares to the sub though because I've never seen the sub, but yeah to geek bite it It is a fantastic movie.

91
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:44,510
Speaker 1: You should just go see it however you can.

92
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,660
Speaker 0: apparently it has the opposite of the Wonder Woman problem.

93
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,380
Speaker 0: I haven't seen it, but rim says it has the opposite of the Wonder Woman.

94
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,759
Speaker 1: Yes, we look at a movie post like the movie poster.

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Speaker 1: It looks like some amazing like different kind of animation with particular style.

96
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,493
Speaker 1: It looks exactly like that poster the whole time.

97
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:00,356
Speaker 0: That's amazing.

98
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:05,380
Speaker 1: It's all like Super flat not super flat, but it's just really flat.

99
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,423
Speaker 1: There's like no depth Perspective.

100
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:08,366
Speaker 0: that really that you know.

101
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:12,140
Speaker 0: looking at the poster and knowing that it looks like the poster makes me want to see it.

102
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:15,680
Speaker 1: It's pretty good, and I don't really want to say anything else about it.

103
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,226
Speaker 1: So consider this geek bite to be.

104
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,300
Speaker 1: go see this movie or get it however you can.

105
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:22,090
Speaker 0: Is it an anime or is it French?

106
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,780
Speaker 1: it's a French animated movie?

107
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,664
Speaker 0: What's it about?

108
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:27,520
Speaker 0: at least about a cat in Paris and a plot summer?

109
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,487
Speaker 1: I don't want to summarize it because I went into it not knowing what it was about and it starts out You're like all right.

110
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:33,115
Speaker 1: There's the cat.

111
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:38,134
Speaker 1: All right cats pretty cool, and then that's what is the central conflict.

112
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:45,560
Speaker 1: revolve around I hope Jewel thieves and a crazy guy and a murderer and some cops and the.

113
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:48,991
Speaker 0: So now we have a better idea, that's good.

114
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,000
Speaker 1: It's better going into it not really knowing.

115
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:56,720
Speaker 1: All I got to say is when you see the gigantic Giants penis You'll know that you're in fact in the right movie.

116
00:05:57,162 --> 00:06:01,180
Speaker 1: There is a villain the villains described early on as a raving lunatic.

117
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:08,540
Speaker 1: Yes, and when you meet him he is a raving lunatic like to a degree it was Chekhov's lunatism.

118
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:14,417
Speaker 1: All right, so we would have reviewed it, but Scott couldn't even pirate it.

119
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:15,220
Speaker 1: so we got there.

120
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:27,956
Speaker 0: It was very is possible theoretically But yet difficult to get a subtitled or version because like people are like oh download the French version here and get the subtitle file And I'm like yeah fuck that noise.

121
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:39,965
Speaker 0: It's like yo 1997 digital fan subs call yeah, so if somebody out there wants to go through this trouble and go through all these sketchy websites one Website I went to was like here download the whole thing, and I'm like okay Don't move dot exe.

122
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:43,860
Speaker 0: right it was like blah blah blah dot exe, and I'm like I'm not stupid.

123
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:57,838
Speaker 0: So if anyone else wants to get viruses and somehow put together a non virus File with some English subtitles built in that are properly synced and such Put that on the Pirate Bay, but if not I'll just wait to watch this somehow.

124
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,507
Speaker 1: otherwise Yeah, it was a good movie.

125
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:04,651
Speaker 1: That was it was refreshing because for me This was pretty good, but I went out of the theater like all right.

126
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:10,320
Speaker 1: I went out of the theater here like oh, yeah So there's not really much news in the anime.

127
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:18,513
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess Otakon coming up Whatever, so um I haven't done Scott's box in forever.

128
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,300
Speaker 0: Just cuz I sort of stopped doing that.

129
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:23,324
Speaker 0: I'm gonna maybe bring it back with increased production But who knows what?

130
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:26,000
Speaker 0: but so I figure hey is a way to cop out of a news.

131
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:33,258
Speaker 0: I'll just quickly go down the list not of what I've received But what I just ordered today because I sent in my order form today all right now from DCVs.

132
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:38,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, so now you will know what to order, but in particular one of these items is going to be my news.

133
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,750

300
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:00,649
Speaker 1: We gotta write this new goddamn panel.

301
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:09,478
Speaker 1: I guess the new triple threat Seattle Seattle Not walla walla Seattle.

302
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,618
Speaker 1: Summer shows are a little sporadic.

303
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,066
Speaker 1: We're gonna be in Wildwood this weekend.

304
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:17,414
Speaker 1: if anyone's in Wildwood great tweet at us.

305
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:21,938
Speaker 1: We'll meet you on the beach, but We're pretty much gonna be laying on the beach.

306
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,165
Speaker 0: So in other news is right.

307
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:26,973
Speaker 0: first of all you know we've.

308
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:28,680
Speaker 0: you know I've updated the website recently.

309
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,980
Speaker 0: But in addition to I think you go to the website not that you go there.

310
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:40,889
Speaker 0: But I just added because now that the websites updated I can update it a lot in small increments I added the video section of the website And you're probably thinking why don't you go the website?

311
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:42,055
Speaker 0: video section of the website.

312
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:43,000
Speaker 0: I can just go to the YouTube.

313
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:44,340
Speaker 0: You're absolutely correct.

314
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,396
Speaker 0: You can't just go to the you.

315
00:17:45,436 --> 00:17:52,534
Speaker 1: yes But the videos on the website have collected for now a bunch of videos from other YouTube accounts You might not have known about.

316
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:59,099
Speaker 0: yeah And basically you can just come to the website and you'll find all of our relevant geek nights related YouTube videos.

317
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:03,200
Speaker 0: also I'm gonna add some RSS to those videos which that doesn't have them right now.

318
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:05,919
Speaker 0: So that'll make it even easier to say subscribe to our video.

319
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:12,544
Speaker 1: It might also let you realize you know a lot of people don't seem to real that a lot of our panels and things are On YouTube.

320
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:19,220
Speaker 1: yep like if you want to see that famous beyond Dungeons & Dragons Panel or the one where we said World of Warcraft sucks for half hour.

321
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:21,160
Speaker 1: They're all up there.

322
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,630
Speaker 1: You can just watch the entire thing in glorious HD.

323
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:32,840
Speaker 0: also now when we post a new video to the website It'll automatically get tweeted Facebook Etc the same way as everything else and you might have noticed we're doing a Google+ hangout of every episode too.

324
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:40,667
Speaker 1: So there's video of us actually like on the site, and you get to see like you know we do the show But you get to see what happens before the show.

325
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,775
Speaker 1: after the show what we say about.

326
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,240
Speaker 0: you're giving people the finger on the web.

327
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:46,599
Speaker 1: I'm not giving anyone the finger, okay?

328
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:57,528
Speaker 0: Also, I want to remind people the new website since it was upgraded right has added a very powerful feature that people do not know About which is wiki show notes.

329
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:00,598
Speaker 0: you can write show notes for geek nights episodes if you want.

330
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:06,700
Speaker 0: the way it works Is this I could have done a standard wiki, but the problem with standard wikis is spam spam.

331
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:10,809
Speaker 0: So here's how it works on my github account.

332
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:14,017
Speaker 0: There is an FRC show notes public repository.

333
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:17,451
Speaker 0: if you fork that You can then in you create.

334
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:18,840
Speaker 0: there's a text file per episode.

335
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:33,406
Speaker 0: You just have to create a text file in the correct folder with the correct name and in that text file you put the show Notes and you can put any text you want in there And then you send me a pull request and if I accept that pull request your show notes will then immediately Appear on front row.

336
00:19:33,426 --> 00:19:35,940
Speaker 0: crew comm on the page for that episode.

337
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:41,769
Speaker 0: It's a pretty crazy system where all the show notes are on github But it totally works because I can do stuff like that now.

338
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:46,967
Speaker 1: if we started this before we had like a thousand existing episodes I know, but we didn't.

339
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:50,020
Speaker 0: github didn't exist and I wasn't smart enough to think of that clever idea.

340
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:56,080
Speaker 0: But now it does and you can learn get you know, and it really isn't that hard.

341
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,851
Speaker 0: You can actually do the whole thing from github.com.

342
00:19:58,872 --> 00:19:59,514
Speaker 0: You don't need to okay.

343
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:00,699
Speaker 1: We don't have a thousand episodes.

344
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,771
Speaker 1: We have 830 episodes.

345
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:03,379
Speaker 0: good job.

346
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:09,360
Speaker 0: Some of the episodes because somebody went there was a guy who was writing show notes and putting them in our forum.

347
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,091
Speaker 0: Somebody went through and copy pasted all those show notes to github.

348
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,119
Speaker 0: So good job on that guy.

349
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:18,060
Speaker 0: Whoever did that and so there's already some episodes of show notes.

350
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,115
Speaker 0: So you should go and help out on this if you are interested or not.

351
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:22,000
Speaker 0: Why do you work for free?

352
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,111
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know one one request we've gotten.

353
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:27,180
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, we never really read emails on the show.

354
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:35,576
Speaker 1: In fact, we tried to always avoid even talking about the meta of the show Until we made this like one meta moment like this specific place where we talk about that crap.

355
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:40,539
Speaker 1: Yep, so The biggest request we pretty much get other than hey Will you come to my tiny?

356
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,960
Speaker 1: Convention is people who are for whatever reason fans of this and they want to get more involved in the geek nights community.

357
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:49,048
Speaker 1: And you know what little there is.

358
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:49,972
Speaker 1: there's actually a lot.

359
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:51,819
Speaker 1: It's just all in the front recruit forum, right?

360
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,240
Speaker 1: So you can get more ways to get involved.

361
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,440
Speaker 1: You don't want to go into that scary forum where everyone yells at you about grammar, right?

362
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Speaker 0: You can contribute to the show notes by going to github.

363
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,320
Speaker 1: If you have it some sort of like vested political angle, you can get your angle into those show notes.

364
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,269
Speaker 1: We're not really gonna like curate them too.

365
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:10,700
Speaker 0: Well, I mean they have to be accepted by me as a pull request.

366
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:13,600
Speaker 0: So it's basically it's pretty much gonna be a thumbs up or thumbs down situation.

367
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,262
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you're.

368
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:18,217
Speaker 1: if you're like Scott was wrong or rim sucked in this episode, we're gonna let that in.

369
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:18,699
Speaker 1: we're really.

370
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:25,120
Speaker 1: I Think we're gonna Scott's gonna disprove if it's like the word penis eight hundred times in a row with no other content.

371
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:32,245
Speaker 0: Notice I said with no other as long as it's actually show notes and not just you know links to Viagra Right.

372
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:37,800
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway Otherwise, you know, like I said for the other thing the other of course we get is convention.

373
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:49,720
Speaker 1: so seriously, if you want us to come to a convention if You are not the person who runs that convention Don't tell us to go to the convention at least like the panels or the guest department.

374
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:53,057
Speaker 1: We're not gonna go to the convention to say hey, can we come?

375
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:53,480
Speaker 1: it's got it.

376
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,364
Speaker 1: It's the other way around.

377
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:57,560
Speaker 0: you have to tell the convention to ask us to come right?

378
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,159
Speaker 0: You're just a convention goer.

379
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:00,768
Speaker 0: Don't ask us to go to the con.

380
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:02,256
Speaker 0: ask the con to bring us there.

381
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:06,152
Speaker 1: cuz I've had like three Situations recently where someone emailed me like hey would you like to come to ex-con?

382
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:09,206
Speaker 1: and I always send my standard response of yeah You know, it's far away.

Speaker 1: Well, the con has to call us if it's not on our list of cars.

00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:25,360
Speaker 1: We already go to like packs.

391
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:26,478
Speaker 0: exactly.

392
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:32,900
Speaker 1: There's a very we have a short list of cons that we will go to even if we aren't doing any geek nights crap at them.

393
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:33,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

394
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:35,500
Speaker 1: packs and packs and mag fest.

00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:38,319
Speaker 0: yeah.

397
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:39,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

398
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:40,731
Speaker 0: All right.

399
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:44,952
Speaker 1: So, uh, we've actually Despite not doing a lot of anime shows.

400
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:46,480
Speaker 1: We've been watching a lot of anime lately.

401
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:49,132
Speaker 0: I haven't been watching a lot, but there are three shows.

402
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:56,474
Speaker 0: We watched quite a few episodes of The new Lupin but of course, but I haven't watched that in a while and we can't really.

403
00:22:56,494 --> 00:22:58,260
Speaker 0: I've watched like seven or eight episodes.

404
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,645
Speaker 0: I just yeah, then I haven't.

405
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:02,937
Speaker 1: we can't review it until we finish it because for all we know it sucks.

406
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:05,386
Speaker 0: after the last episode We already did a show on it.

407
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:08,197
Speaker 1: - yeah, well, we'll do a real review once it's done.

408
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:11,209
Speaker 1: of course I've been watching polar bears cafe.

409
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:13,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, because my tool told me to watch one episode.

410
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:20,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw one tweet about it and he and he and I was like what polar bear cafe I wonder if that's literally.

411
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:29,253
Speaker 1: and then the next tweet from him was like, yeah, it's really just a polar bear and Kids on the slope, which uh, pretty good.

412
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:35,713
Speaker 0: I watched seven or eight episodes And folk tales from Japan, which is two episodes.

413
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:36,496
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

414
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,864
Speaker 0: Oh my god Why don't we talk about that first?

415
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:39,426
Speaker 0: cuz I'm again?

416
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:48,300
Speaker 1: Okay, so folk tales from Japan is one of those short shows But instead of being short episodes, it's a full-length episode that has three short parts.

417
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:52,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, but otherwise like I think I'm adding it to our bite-sized anime panel.

418
00:23:53,201 --> 00:24:00,764
Speaker 0: First of all, this show right is so cute with its drawing and the drawing style is pretty different depending on the legend being told Right.

419
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:03,824
Speaker 0: So I mean it's like It's just I don't know.

420
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:08,260
Speaker 0: It's just so cute and the animation is so cute and it's it's really simple like they're saving money.

421
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,560
Speaker 0: It's obviously not a big-budget.

422
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:17,928
Speaker 0: It's got two narrators who basically tell you the story the kind of thing like when you were a kid you would have to see On PBS or maybe not even PBS.

423
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:21,399
Speaker 0: maybe like you could see it like at the library, you know.

424
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,666
Speaker 0: But you could never.

425
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:24,922
Speaker 0: you know, it doesn't seem like it's a real TV show But it is.

426
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:28,420
Speaker 1: it's the kind of thing that you'd like when you had a substitute teacher in elementary school.

427
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,564
Speaker 1: They'd show you something like that.

428
00:24:29,604 --> 00:24:36,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm like old fairy tale and as a narrator and You know the characters.

429
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,720
Speaker 0: the characters don't really talk that much and everything's very simple.

430
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:46,714
Speaker 0: But despite all that it's like, you know, then the budget being low The production is not low as you know.

431
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:53,352
Speaker 0: to go with the budget being low Even though it's simple and cute and there isn't a lot of animation going on You don't need that much to tell these stories and what they do.

432
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:55,060
Speaker 0: everything they put into it is so great.

433
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:57,468
Speaker 0: It's like every animal is cute.

434
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,993
Speaker 0: they move, you know.

435
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:01,220
Speaker 0: enough to be awesome is a cute.

436
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,622
Speaker 1: Well, I think really the strength of it is that you know being not Japanese Like.

437
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:12,719
Speaker 1: I know the kind of like really big Japanese folk tales kind of like how people around the world know a lot of the big American folk tales.

438
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:20,866
Speaker 1: There's like a a collected set of folk tales and legends that most people know about but I don't really expect someone in Japan to Know about Johnny Appleseed or Paul Bunyan?

439
00:25:20,906 --> 00:25:24,057
Speaker 1: necessarily exactly granted Paul Bunyan might be more well-known now.

440
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:24,317
Speaker 1: Thanks.

441
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:24,598
Speaker 1: Dr.

442
00:25:24,618 --> 00:25:24,819
Speaker 1: McNinja.

443
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:26,045
Speaker 0: I don't think Dr.

444
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:28,458
Speaker 0: McNinja is that popular in Japan, although he should be.

445
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,855
Speaker 1: But you know beyond like Momotaro and a certain like set of Japanese folk tales.

446
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:35,200
Speaker 1: I don't know most of these stories.

447
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:37,545
Speaker 0: No kidding Cuz he didn't grow up as elementary school kids in Japan.

448
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:44,166
Speaker 1: And Japanese folk tales have a pretty different lilt from the folk tales I'm used to from when I was a kid.

449
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:46,294
Speaker 0: So pretty much all of them are the same, right?

450
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:47,980
Speaker 1: There's someone who does something good.

451
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,413
Speaker 0: Okay, wait, here are the common trends in all of these folk tales from.

452
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:52,517
Speaker 0: I've watched two episodes so far.

453
00:25:52,537 --> 00:25:53,400
Speaker 1: Should we tell them the trends?

454
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,924
Speaker 1: Let's just tell them the lessons you should learn.

455
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:55,948
Speaker 0: I hear the trends, ready?

456
00:25:55,988 --> 00:26:02,547
Speaker 0: Number one, the honest person always gets gold as like a rewards and the nosy neighbor gets fucked.

457
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:08,500
Speaker 0: The lying, cheating, stealing, evil person gets some horrible punishment like poop in the face But it's always pretty specific.

458
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,190
Speaker 1: It's something good happens to someone because they're a good person.

459
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:15,204
Speaker 1: then a neighbor comes into the house and says oh my god where'd you get all that gold?

460
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:24,098
Speaker 1: and then they hear the story and they go try to do the exact same thing all evil like and Get horse poop in the face or killed or something, right?

461
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,137
Speaker 0: So if your friend got rich playing the stock market do not play the stock market.

462
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:29,940
Speaker 0: That is the lesson.

463
00:26:30,562 --> 00:26:32,509
Speaker 0: No, I think your friends got rich betting on horses.

464
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,352
Speaker 0: Don't bet on horses.

465
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:35,680
Speaker 1: Don't be a noisy neighbor or a nosy neighbor.

466
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't be a greedy.

467
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:38,460
Speaker 1: right neighbors alone, you know?

468
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:46,465
Speaker 1: Oh more importantly if there's a magical artifact and someone tells you not to do something Do not fucking do it.

469
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,753
Speaker 0: Any magical instructions from any supernatural source.

470
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:56,606
Speaker 0: if a Buddha or an animal or a Goddess or a princess tells you to do something Follow those instructions.

471
00:26:56,706 --> 00:27:01,380
Speaker 0: and also the bad people are going to specifically not follow those instructions and they'll be punished for it.

472
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:03,628
Speaker 0: And if you follow the instructions, you'll be rewarded for it.

473
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:08,899
Speaker 1: Unless the instructions come from someone who is obviously bad Then you're rewarded for not doing it.

474
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,540
Speaker 0: Yes, it's obvious to be able to tell what the good instructions are and what the bad instructions are.

475
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:16,850
Speaker 1: I think my favorite ones are.

476
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:19,980
Speaker 1: I really like the one about the man the old men with the bumps.

477
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:21,291
Speaker 1: You didn't see that one.

478
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:22,340
Speaker 1: No, there's one guy with.

479
00:27:23,421 --> 00:27:24,465
Speaker 0: There's any animals.

480
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:27,236
Speaker 0: just be nice to all animals and you'll be rewarded.

481
00:27:27,376 --> 00:27:30,663
Speaker 1: Yep turtles Doggies boxes.

482
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:32,611
Speaker 1: Well, there's the trickster Fox, but he got his.

483
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,558
Speaker 0: yeah fishies anything.

484
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:35,080
Speaker 0: That's nice.

485
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:38,360
Speaker 0: You should be nice to it and you will be rewarded for being nice to animals.

486
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:48,723
Speaker 0: All right You get to hang out with hot Mermaid princess in her palace under the sea for all eternity or you're a dumbass and you leave to go back to the real Stupid world.

487
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:49,004
Speaker 1: Yeah.

488
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:50,911
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's another lesson.

489
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:53,731
Speaker 0: if you got it good if you're in paradise, don't leave That's right.

490
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:58,262
Speaker 1: If you got the reward if you think I should really go out and see my family now That's.

491
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:01,400
Speaker 0: that is one thing I noticed right in an American folktale, right?

492
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:08,408
Speaker 0: You would or a fairy tale you would often see a situation where someone get a reward and say no I don't need the reward because I'm such a good person.

493
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:11,580
Speaker 0: Yep, and this it's like I got rewarded with gold.

494
00:28:12,102 --> 00:28:13,046
Speaker 0: Enjoy the gold.

495
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,040
Speaker 0: like there's one greedy looking for more gold, right?

496
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,160
Speaker 0: You got the gold in or reward usually gold because you were sometimes fancy cloth, right?

497
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,118
Speaker 0: Because you were genuinely nice and honest and you got rewarded for it.

498
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:29,560
Speaker 0: Don't go greedy looking for more rewards because that make turns you to the bad person.

499
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:35,260
Speaker 0: You'll lose the reward but and don't go just trying to be honest or you know on purpose to get rewards.

500
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,600
Speaker 1: But if you got a reward those monkeys carry that guy away and gave him gold.

501
00:28:39,582 --> 00:28:43,773
Speaker 0: If you got an honest reward, just enjoy that reward.

502
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:46,520
Speaker 0: All right, don't go giving it up or anything like that.

503
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,779
Speaker 0: Just enjoy it because otherwise no good.

504
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,024
Speaker 1: but also like what?

505
00:28:50,044 --> 00:28:50,184
Speaker 1: like?

506
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:56,188
Speaker 1: I think the most interesting one for that because I didn't expect the outcome that happened was the guy had The dream about the treasure.

507
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,119
Speaker 1: the other guys like let me buy your dream from you.

508
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:09,200
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and then he goes to try to find that treasure and I thought the moral was gonna be the guy who sold him The dream was just smart and basically got some free money out of him because the other guy was an idiot.

509
00:29:09,744 --> 00:29:10,913
Speaker 1: But then there was really gold.

510
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:18,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, so He was honest for buying the dream and then the guy who owned the land that had the treasure split it within 50/50 Which is sort of like.

511
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:35,840
Speaker 1: But seriously if you're evil or a bad neighbor or a nosy neighbor and you think you're gonna get a bunch of gold Because you're gonna do this plot don't burn all your clothes before your husband comes back with the gold.

512
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's not coming back with the gold.

513
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,350
Speaker 0: This really makes me wonder like how Japanese culture like neighbors are viewed.

514
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:54,651
Speaker 0: right because the only Japanese like I mean I only really know every neighbor in these is a day The only anime or manga I can think of where there's neighbors that are like, you know Good and friendly is Yotsuba right?

515
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:56,018
Speaker 0: Yotsuba has awesome neighbors.

516
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:59,163
Speaker 1: Oh Here's Greenwood.

517
00:29:59,183 --> 00:30:01,531
Speaker 1: The neighbors are awesome, but they're not good neighbors.

518
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:03,980
Speaker 1: What neighbors are there in the other rooms in the dog?

519
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,128
Speaker 0: Oh, that's dorm mates.

520
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:07,143
Speaker 0: That's not the same as not the same I'm talking about.

521
00:30:07,163 --> 00:30:11,560
Speaker 0: you're in a house and the people who live in the neighboring house the house next to it.

522
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,292
Speaker 1: Usually those people don't exist in anime.

523
00:30:13,332 --> 00:30:14,319
Speaker 0: That's what I'm talking about.

524
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:16,347
Speaker 0: Right, but in a lot of u.s.

525
00:30:16,508 --> 00:30:23,151
Speaker 0: Culture right neighbors happen a lot Dennis the Menace neighbors And it's always bad.

526
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:27,754
Speaker 0: So Steve Urkel man, right, but that's what I'm saying.

527
00:30:27,774 --> 00:30:29,100
Speaker 1: Is that wait in both Japan in the u.s.

528
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,310
Speaker 1: If there's a neighbor in a story they are bad mr.

529
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,130
Speaker 1: Rogers He was his neighborhood though.

530
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:40,500
Speaker 0: Maybe all his Sesame Street And you know, we have good and bad neighbors in a lot, right?

531
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:54,685
Speaker 0: It seems that neighbors at least in animes among us I have read one show that we're following that out, right the animes and mangas that I have read are rare and in my exposure To their folk tales their neighbors are frequent but always evil Really evil.

532
00:30:55,006 --> 00:30:59,400
Speaker 1: one of them was evil greedy one guy who's a dog greedy and mischievous and annoying.

533
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,088
Speaker 1: They're greedy and usually kind of dumb and nosy.

534
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:02,529
Speaker 0: All right.

535
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you're ever in the mouse paradise don't pretend to be a cat That's right.

536
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:10,529
Speaker 0: So anyway This folktale show is totally awesome and you can learn.

537
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:17,170
Speaker 0: not only you can not only laugh at these awesome folk tales and enjoy them But learn about folk tales from a foreign culture.

538
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:19,740
Speaker 0: I really want to see this show from other countries.

539
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,440
Speaker 0: I want the Russian cute folktale show the Indian cute folktale show the African cute.

540
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,779
Speaker 0: I want to see all the folk tales in the whole world like this.

541
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,284
Speaker 1: They're probably our shows.

542
00:31:28,324 --> 00:31:32,296
Speaker 0: from all those Australian folktale show French folktale show hook me up.

543
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:35,700
Speaker 0: Yo, hook me up Give me a ball and it's on crunchyroll.

544
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,872
Speaker 0: You can just watch all the episodes at least as they're coming.

545
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:44,240
Speaker 1: and if you watch it with Scott In the opening credit when it says what I'm always gonna point out the snake one of the animals moves.

546
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,530
Speaker 1: It's gotta be like it was the snake.

547
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,574
Speaker 0: It's pretty funny.

548
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:48,840
Speaker 0: Every episode is the same.

549
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,967
Speaker 0: It's always snake then chicken then bunny.

550
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:53,777
Speaker 0: as the third one the snake chicken bunny snake is the best.

551
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:55,987
Speaker 1: Scott pays a lot of attention To this snake is the greatest.

552
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:56,772
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good show.

553
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:57,557
Speaker 0: It's a really good snake.

554
00:31:57,818 --> 00:32:02,497
Speaker 1: So Before I knew what kids on the slope was about I knew it was about jazz.

555
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:04,849
Speaker 0: I knew is by Watanabe with you.

556
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:05,680
Speaker 0: so that's the thing.

557
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:14,760
Speaker 1: All I heard was someone said there's a new Watanabe show coming out and yoko kano is doing the music and my brain said cowboy bebop.

558
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:18,268
Speaker 0: It's gonna be cowboy bebop or something like.

559
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:21,738
Speaker 0: I know it's gonna be heavily musical just like samurai champloo.

560
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:22,460
Speaker 0: and also the show.

561
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:24,364
Speaker 1: It's pretty good show.

562
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:25,768
Speaker 1: It's not like how we bebop though.

563
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,620
Speaker 0: No, so I watched probably more episodes than rim has right.

564
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,980
Speaker 1: I think I've seen like four and I fell asleep during one because I just got back from a trip.

565
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:37,700
Speaker 0: So what I actually like about this show so far is number one.

566
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,298
Speaker 0: It's it's about jazz, right?

567
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:45,180
Speaker 0: But and it sort of leads you in this direction thinking it's gonna be typical anime tropes, right?

568
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,089
Speaker 0: Transfer student is sort of the main focus.

569
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:57,160
Speaker 0: character moves into town goes to school There's some bullies and some a girl and it's like I know where this goes same old same old.

570
00:32:57,382 --> 00:32:59,220
Speaker 0: Oh, well the jazz music aspect.

571
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,172
Speaker 1: I thought it was gonna do the the twist of.

572
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:06,114
Speaker 1: it's the same old show But it has the kind of like getting you into it.

573
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:07,840
Speaker 1: anime about jazz, right?

574
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,245
Speaker 0: So I thought it was gonna do that but it actually so far Hasn't done that.

575
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:22,609
Speaker 0: it's like the jazz is there but it's not doing a Hajime no Ippo Shonen jump sort of bakuman teach you everything But it does name drops You

576
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:23,221
Speaker 1: know You should

577
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:36,440
Speaker 0: know right and all it does is jazz is just the thing that is bringing these characters together and it's mostly about the characters, you know And you know their dramas and jazz just happens to be this thing in their lives.

578
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,449
Speaker 0: That is like, you know the good awesome thing.

579
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,092
Speaker 0: That is awesome.

580
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:39,313
Speaker 1: Yep.

581
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:40,600
Speaker 1: I like the show a lot.

582
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:49,538
Speaker 0: The reason I like it is because after you watch a few episodes, you can see that these characters Do not behave the way the anime character should behave.

583
00:33:49,578 --> 00:33:54,352
Speaker 0: for example What is the typical anime character do when there's a girl avoid talking to her?

584
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,997
Speaker 0: never right in this show?

585
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:58,120
Speaker 0: It's like hey What's up, right?

586
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,009
Speaker 0: totally opposite of what anime characters do.

587
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:06,940
Speaker 1: there's a little anime is gonna hang over everyone's heads forever and Escalate and escalate and then be like a plot point here.

588
00:34:08,525 --> 00:34:12,940
Speaker 0: They fight the bullies right away and then they're only there occasionally if at all, right.

589
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:18,080
Speaker 0: And it really sort of gets into like, you know this sort of and the plot moves, right?

590
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:26,694
Speaker 0: It starts off for the school is a larger factor in the opening episodes because they're introducing the characters You know and it's like oh the bad guy sits in the back of class later episodes.

591
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:49,105
Speaker 0: You're not even seeing the classroom It's just not even there, you know, it's all this stuff outside the classroom and they keep bringing in, you know It's like they bring you up stuff that you think is gonna show up like at the end of the show Like oh his dad isn't around his dad is traveling military something like that You know, his mom is who knows where you know, it's like and you're like, oh, we'll learn the mystery of his family like Episode 26.

592
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:52,580
Speaker 0: It's like no, you don't learn the episode that his family's gonna show up right away.

593
00:34:53,062 --> 00:34:53,907
Speaker 0: No mystery at all.

594
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,737
Speaker 0: And it's like oh we know where mom is.

595
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:56,260
Speaker 0: Let's go see her.

596
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:02,180
Speaker 0: Okay, you know and I really like that moving right along not cutting corners, you know progressing.

597
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:07,460
Speaker 0: But even as they progress and resolve these plots, they don't completely resolve them, right?

598
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,852
Speaker 0: They move them and then the goalposts go farther out.

599
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:14,402
Speaker 1: So, you know what another show that did that was Nana Exactly.

600
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:20,733
Speaker 1: Nana was like alright here like I expect the plot to be the the thing about like meeting that guy again And then they get there right?

601
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:21,440
Speaker 1: They meet him again.

602
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:24,265
Speaker 0: It's almost just like Nana.

603
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:24,706
Speaker 1: You know what?

604
00:35:24,746 --> 00:35:25,749
Speaker 1: I really like Nana.

605
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,535
Speaker 0: It's a little less so poppery.

606
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:27,756
Speaker 1: Yeah.

607
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:32,428
Speaker 1: Yeah Now what is both the strength and like?

608
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:36,363
Speaker 1: the worst thing I can say about the show is that it doesn't need to be Animated.

609
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:42,932
Speaker 1: I like it and I'm you know, I have no problem with it at all But it doesn't scratch that like crazy anime.

610
00:35:43,012 --> 00:35:43,594
Speaker 1: It should just scratch.

611
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:45,300
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's a good show to watch it.

612
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:46,564
Speaker 0: Yeah I think this would be like.

613
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:53,053
Speaker 0: you might as well be a manga anime wise because it's mostly people talking and not a lot of Action with the music, but you need the music.

614
00:35:53,073 --> 00:35:53,274
Speaker 0: Yep.

615
00:35:53,515 --> 00:35:54,340
Speaker 0: It's about jazz.

616
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,043
Speaker 0: How do you know?

617
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:57,796
Speaker 1: it's the same reason why Nodabe Cantabile like the manga.

618
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:58,620
Speaker 0: it is a manga.

619
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:00,846
Speaker 1: But I didn't.

620
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:03,595
Speaker 1: I couldn't read that manga just was actually pretty boring.

621
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:05,360
Speaker 1: but then watching the show I loved every second of it.

622
00:36:07,223 --> 00:36:08,731
Speaker 0: Is there anything else to say about it?

623
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:09,234
Speaker 1: Not really.

624
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,380
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't want to spoil anything.

625
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,812
Speaker 1: We're just saying it's a show you should watch.

626
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:15,105
Speaker 0: Yeah Negative thing about it.

627
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:19,160
Speaker 0: I would say that none of the characters are like super awesome, right?

628
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,154
Speaker 0: Usually there's someone in a show that's like that's the awesomest dude.

629
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:23,220
Speaker 1: There's like one bunta.

630
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:29,218
Speaker 0: yeah, a bunta or You know Who's the guy in full metal alchemist who got killed?

631
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's.

632
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:35,920
Speaker 0: no there is no one in the show who is like super awesome.

633
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:48,802
Speaker 0: The main character is like he's got good parts and bad parts and he reminds me, you know, he reminds me It's almost too realistic and that every character has awesome parts and not awesome parts so that there's nobody you can really say like that's Some guy.

634
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:49,804
Speaker 0: I'm rooting for him all.

635
00:36:49,864 --> 00:36:59,271
Speaker 1: the main character reminds me a little bit of aspects of both main characters from karikano Just a little bit like I thought he's got a blue.

636
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,735
Speaker 0: He's got some jerkiness going on.

637
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:02,080
Speaker 0: That's not in karikano.

638
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,310
Speaker 1: I just I found it interesting that watching the first few episodes.

639
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:08,009
Speaker 1: I thought of karikano a couple of times Just when characters did certain things.

640
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:10,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the show ever forgot about.

641
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:20,400
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, there's no awesome people but it I guess maybe the dad who owns the jazz shop is awesome But you don't see him at all.

642
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,385
Speaker 0: Right other than that he like he's barely in the frame and he says like maybe two lines He's very strict.

643
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:25,969
Speaker 1: we get that.

644
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,960
Speaker 1: that's especially about the jazz, right?

645
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,869
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to go in the basement unless you're jazzing.

646
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,391
Speaker 0: That's right.

647
00:37:31,672 --> 00:37:33,960
Speaker 0: Not jazz hands and he plays the bass.

648
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:36,847
Speaker 1: So polar bears cafe.

649
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:38,170
Speaker 0: I only saw one episode.

650
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:39,934
Speaker 1: I only saw one episode.

651
00:37:40,035 --> 00:37:41,939
Speaker 0: Okay, it is a review of one episode.

652
00:37:42,702 --> 00:37:43,265
Speaker 1: You know what it is.

653
00:37:43,285 --> 00:37:46,580
Speaker 1: This is a show about a polar bear runs a cafe.

654
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,764
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing right.

655
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:58,000
Speaker 0: the show is called polar bear cafe and there is a literal cafe run by a polar bear Who's pretty cool, but the first episode focused entirely on this panda who was trying to get a job there.

656
00:37:58,305 --> 00:37:59,140
Speaker 0: Well, he's trying to get a job.

657
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,485
Speaker 0: Well, you wouldn't want to get a job.

658
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:03,597
Speaker 0: His mom was making him get a job with a vacuum cleaner, right?

659
00:38:03,638 --> 00:38:16,200
Speaker 0: But anyway And that is the polar bear cafe was almost secondary and it focused mostly on this lazy-ass panda Who wasn't getting a job and was laying around his mom's house all day doing nothing and wanted to do nothing.

660
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,712
Speaker 0: It was super lazy because he's a panda.

661
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:20,279
Speaker 0: He just wanted to eat bamboo Because that's a panda's do.

662
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:26,756
Speaker 0: And I wonder if in the later episodes the focus goes off the panda to these other characters.

663
00:38:26,797 --> 00:38:27,840
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it does.

664
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:29,716
Speaker 1: It's not the panda bears cafe.

665
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:33,580
Speaker 0: Yeah But I'd really I'd want to find out about the polar bear and his cafe.

666
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:37,180
Speaker 0: I don't really care that much about any learning anything more about the panda, but I like it.

667
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,075
Speaker 1: So it's one of those odd shows is very atmospheric.

668
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:51,899
Speaker 0: It's very punny Like the Bear is a pretty serious dude except for when he always does a million puns whenever he can, you know, and that's like his deal.

669
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:54,845
Speaker 1: But here's what I know.

670
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:57,715
Speaker 1: the first I like the voice actor like of the polar bear.

671
00:38:57,876 --> 00:38:58,217
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

672
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:02,311
Speaker 1: You know that is It's a Takahiro Sakurai and you probably remember him.

673
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:04,320
Speaker 1: don't know who that is the main character in gatekeepers.

674
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:06,411
Speaker 0: Okay, you know shouldn't?

675
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:13,637
Speaker 0: yeah gatekeepers That was the biggest show for a little while for five and RIT cuz it was the only digitally fan sub show.

676
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:17,554
Speaker 1: Yep Then gatekeepers 21, which I never even watched.

677
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:24,619
Speaker 1: I watched like one episode Yeah, but for some reason that show for us at that time was the best show ever for like five minutes.

678
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,044
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, it's all good.

679
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:26,726
Speaker 0: Let's do a show on game.

680
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:29,255
Speaker 1: You can open the gate.

681
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:30,318
Speaker 1: We gotta watch it everyone.

682
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:30,780
Speaker 0: Have we done?

683
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,707
Speaker 1: There's no way on it.

684
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,384
Speaker 1: I'll search anyway, but anyway Something else I found out.

685
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:41,020
Speaker 1: this is directed by the same person who directed cheese sweet home.

686
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:51,372
Speaker 1: It's got almost the exact same kind of pacing like a character will say something And they're a manga for polar bear cafe cuz he's sweet home as a manga.

687
00:39:51,392 --> 00:39:52,977
Speaker 1: This is why we're not anime world order.

688
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:55,300
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, it does that thing.

689
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:06,775
Speaker 1: We're like a scene will start and the characters are kind of just sitting there For a while and then someone says something and then the camera Stays there for a little while after it's very short on dialogue.

690
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:07,900
Speaker 0: They don't say any words.

691
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,049
Speaker 0: They don't have to say mitsuyuki masahara.

692
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:10,672
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

693
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,519
Speaker 1: I did not know who that was until now.

694
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:14,506
Speaker 1: Okay, but cheese sweet home.

695
00:40:14,526 --> 00:40:18,339
Speaker 1: I can see I'd also learned there's a sequel to cheese sweet home that I didn't know about.

696
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,951
Speaker 1: cool I feel like I gotta get back into the anime loop.

697
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:21,977
Speaker 1: nice a little bit.

698
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:25,400
Speaker 0: So The other thing is the way the show works, right?

699
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:33,904
Speaker 0: He's like, well the polar bear runs the cafe though It's some world that looks like modern-day Japan except there are normal people who are humans 100% just humans.

700
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,067
Speaker 0: and there are animals.

701
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:38,798
Speaker 0: and the animals aren't like furry animals where they like cat people.

702
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:39,440
Speaker 0: They're just people.

703
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:40,403
Speaker 0: It's just up.

704
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,387
Speaker 0: It is a polar bear.

705
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:43,676
Speaker 0: It wears clothes, but it is a polar bear.

706
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:44,640
Speaker 1: I love the polar.

707
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,245
Speaker 0: Is a panda.

708
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,772
Speaker 1: love out at the zoo the interviews for a job.

709
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:51,340
Speaker 1: That's like be a panda at right zoo.

710
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:56,740
Speaker 0: But they these animals interact with society as if they are persons, right?

711
00:40:56,841 --> 00:41:03,440
Speaker 0: So even though it's you know Biologically a panda it talks it has I guess the equivalent of a social security card.

712
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,499
Speaker 0: It has jobs and a house and money and you know, he doesn't have a job, right?

713
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:14,345
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, but I mean it might as well be a person that is just biologically a panda with a human brain Capabilities.

714
00:41:14,587 --> 00:41:16,760
Speaker 1: so maybe we were talking about this when we watch the show.

715
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,754
Speaker 1: Maybe it's all just people and these characters are being represented.

716
00:41:21,794 --> 00:41:22,556
Speaker 0: That's what I'm thinking.

717
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:23,820
Speaker 1: is their spirit animal?

718
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:24,765
Speaker 0: It's all.

719
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:26,917
Speaker 0: it's actually all people literally.

720
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:33,660
Speaker 0: but Instead of drawing the panda who as a person who has the spirit of a panda and acts like a panda?

721
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:38,480
Speaker 0: So they draw him as a panda and call him panda, but it's really a person but it doesn't matter.

722
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,465
Speaker 0: That's really a person.

723
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:45,395
Speaker 1: that reality will be ruined in like episode 3 when the pole I'm sure someone randomly and then the show goes back to right.

724
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:46,220
Speaker 0: so it's kind of funny.

725
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:53,600
Speaker 0: He gets a job at the zoo Right, which and he has to like perform for the nursery school, but that other pan is a full-time panda.

726
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was just a part-time zoo panda time panda.

727
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:58,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was funny.

728
00:41:58,578 --> 00:41:59,080
Speaker 0: was the nursery?

729
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:00,545
Speaker 0: What the nursery school?

730
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:01,950
Speaker 0: kids all seem to be human, right?

731
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,776
Speaker 0: Did you didn't see any animals in nursery schools?

732
00:42:03,796 --> 00:42:06,542
Speaker 1: Don't go to school I don't know.

733
00:42:06,602 --> 00:42:07,264
Speaker 0: I was under the impression.

734
00:42:07,304 --> 00:42:11,616
Speaker 0: The panda was in school, but graduated and didn't want to work.

735
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:13,160
Speaker 0: I don't know whatever.

736
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,523
Speaker 0: Yes, it's cool.

737
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:20,640
Speaker 0: how the animals the you know, it's sort of like Damaka dobutsu in which the animals express their nature.

738
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:22,048
Speaker 0: The panda acts like a panda.

739
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:23,959
Speaker 0: he's lazy and he wants to eat bamboo and that's it.

740
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not like the polar bear because polar bears aren't necessarily known for their puns and cafes.

741
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:35,034
Speaker 0: Maybe they are in Japan I don't know But I don't think I. the thing of the difference from Damaka dobutsu is Damaka dobutsu.

742
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,961
Speaker 0: the animals are the opposite of their nature Right.

743
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:40,433
Speaker 0: So the wolf was all you know, sappy or whatever right in this.

744
00:42:40,794 --> 00:42:42,500
Speaker 0: the animals match their nature, right?

745
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,566
Speaker 0: So if there was a wolf in this you would be all eating people like a hey He's not there isn't?

746
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:48,289
Speaker 0: I don't think.

747
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:49,414
Speaker 0: what were the other animals?

748
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:50,700
Speaker 0: it was a sloth, right?

749
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,767
Speaker 0: Yep, and the polar bear.

750
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:54,613
Speaker 0: and who was the guy who's always at the counter?

751
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:56,520
Speaker 0: the I don't remember.

752
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,335
Speaker 0: I don't remember just watched it.

753
00:42:58,516 --> 00:42:58,819
Speaker 0: I know.

754
00:42:59,482 --> 00:43:01,669
Speaker 0: Anyway, the animals the animals are like the best characters.

755
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,054
Speaker 1: It's a cute show.

756
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:04,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, very good.

757
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:13,541
Speaker 0: Oh, right There's the whole part where he's interviewing animals for than everybody said all the animals match their nature so none of them were good for working at the Cafe.

758
00:43:13,582 --> 00:43:16,249
Speaker 1: so then he's like I've decided to hire this girl.

759
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:21,845
Speaker 0: the human girl is the best worker for the cafe, of course But it's a cute show.

760
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:22,386
Speaker 1: I like it.

761
00:43:22,627 --> 00:43:22,908
Speaker 1: Actually.

762
00:43:22,928 --> 00:43:24,573
Speaker 1: I like all three of these shows.

763
00:43:24,593 --> 00:43:27,180
Speaker 0: I'm kind of what eventually watch all these shows.

764
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,880
Speaker 0: Yep, I'm gonna finish Lupin first and definitely that's a higher priority show.

765
00:43:33,482 --> 00:43:35,448
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's a lot suddenly right?

766
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:40,786
Speaker 0: There's no big-name new awesome animes like Madoka unless there's one I don't notice happening right now.

767
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,589
Speaker 1: I think we'd notice.

768
00:43:41,629 --> 00:43:43,415
Speaker 1: I mean remember when Madoka didn't notice.

769
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,057
Speaker 0: Madoka tells 100% done.

770
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we noticed.

771
00:43:46,486 --> 00:43:48,533
Speaker 0: I knew it was a giant thread in our forum.

772
00:43:48,573 --> 00:43:50,720
Speaker 1: I just didn't watch it, but I knew about it.

773
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,720
Speaker 1: I knew that's the big anime that everyone's talking about, right?

774
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,620
Speaker 0: So there doesn't seem to be a big anime right now a Madoka style that we want.

775
00:43:57,981 --> 00:44:01,052
Speaker 0: But there are plenty of good animes happening right now.

776
00:44:01,113 --> 00:44:08,260
Speaker 0: suddenly that are really smaller under-the-radar Animes that are good for people like us, but maybe not good for the anime community at large.

777
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,356
Speaker 0: You're not gonna see polar bear cafe cosplay if I do.

778
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:13,840
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh I think there will be but it'll be in the city.

779
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,611
Speaker 1: It'll be like our crowd or Mike tools crowd Darryl's crowd.

780
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:18,920
Speaker 1: Those people will dress up in a duffel.

781
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,699
Speaker 0: Hey, you're not gonna see Japanese folktale cosplay.

782
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,414
Speaker 0: Oh, you know dominating the conventions ahead of say the bleach cosplay, but I bleach.

783
00:44:26,454 --> 00:44:28,300
Speaker 1: I think you mean homestuck, right?

784
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:28,962
Speaker 0: Exactly.

785
00:44:29,684 --> 00:44:34,040
Speaker 0: But anyway, there are these good under-the-radar small-time shows that are kind of awesome.

786
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,597
Speaker 0: And if you really need an anime to watch and you really don't guess what they're all there's nothing.

787
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:38,898
Speaker 1: you're all.

788
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:41,550
Speaker 0: you can watch them Legally, yeah, you can watch all these things legally.

789
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:46,328
Speaker 0: I think they're all on crunchy real kids in the slopus Crunchy roll Lupin is funimation.

790
00:44:46,488 --> 00:44:47,995
Speaker 0: All these all the rest of those are all crunchy roll.

791
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:48,798
Speaker 0: Yeah free.

792
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:55,075
Speaker 1: so If you really need it to anime, you know, it's an aside, but you know Like we talked about in the churn something that's happened.

793
00:44:55,136 --> 00:44:55,619
Speaker 1: Is that for?

794
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,182
Speaker 1: Internet types.

795
00:44:57,744 --> 00:45:01,896
Speaker 1: anime has gotten pretty mainstream and that it a lot of people watch these shows.

796
00:45:01,956 --> 00:45:03,060
Speaker 1: a lot of people like anime.

797
00:45:03,554 --> 00:45:05,245
Speaker 0: Yeah people have enough.

798
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:12,159
Speaker 0: people are watching these folk tales to where it's worth for a while for crunchy roll to pay to get the Rights to put it on crunchy roll and to sell ads on it.

799
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:13,447
Speaker 1: But I think what what happened?

800
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:19,069
Speaker 1: we talked about in the last show too, but specifically Most of the people are watching anime nowadays.

801
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,720
Speaker 1: I don't think are engaged in anime fan culture.

802
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:30,731
Speaker 0: Yeah I think there's people who go to crunchy roll who are watching these shows who are not going to cons not going on message boards Not reading anime news network not doing anything like that.

803
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:32,780
Speaker 0: They're just going to crunchy roll and watching these shows.

804
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:34,480
Speaker 1: I think there's a. I think there's three categories.

805
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,980
Speaker 1: There's what you said and then there's the people who do those things and go to anime cons.

806
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,840
Speaker 1: So they seem to be the minority at the anime cons now, but there's a third part.

807
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:48,842
Speaker 1: I think there are people who do read anime news network and they engage in a lot of the online Stuff like.

808
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:49,887
Speaker 1: they'll research anime.

809
00:45:49,907 --> 00:45:51,193
Speaker 1: They'll be into that stuff.

810
00:45:51,675 --> 00:45:52,860
Speaker 1: They'll post on the anime news network.

811
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:59,254
Speaker 1: They just don't go to cons at all Because the cons have a lot less anime stuff than the internet does.

812
00:45:59,274 --> 00:46:01,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Homestuck is the best anime, right?

813
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:07,542
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, well the most popular anime sure that in My Little Pony, yeah Okay, we're done.

814
00:46:07,622 --> 00:46:08,223
Speaker 1: I think we're done.
