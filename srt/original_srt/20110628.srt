1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,468
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, June 28th, 2011.

2
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:12,930
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,611
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:16,740
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights, tonight's small world.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,688
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,488
Speaker 0: So I've been playing some, uh, some games lately.

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,211
Speaker 1: Really?

8
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:29,913
Speaker 0: A lot of games.

9
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:31,660
Speaker 0: We've been playing some Reef Encounter.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,683
Speaker 0: We got to talk about that.

11
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:33,326
Speaker 1: We played it once.

12
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:35,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we got to play some more.

13
00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:36,740
Speaker 0: We played Small World twice.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,300
Speaker 0: We've been really kind of up in the, uh, the local hardcore gaming in the last weeks.

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,280
Speaker 1: Well, we've been, you know, it was just, it's been too hard for too long to get people to play serious games.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,276
Speaker 1: So we put in, like, an extra effort to actually, you know, directly organize them to be like, "Look, we're playing some fucking serious games.

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,699
Speaker 1: If you want to play them, then fucking show

18
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:56,859
Speaker 1: up.".

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,544
Speaker 0: Yep, so it's going well.

20
00:00:58,664 --> 00:01:00,951
Speaker 0: Also, we started up our big, uh, Burning Wheel game.

21
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:04,120
Speaker 0: Our, you know, bi-weekly, actual, for real campaign.

22
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:07,220
Speaker 0: Of course, Burning Wheel revised just came out.

23
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:07,841
Speaker 1: Yeah.

24
00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:10,949
Speaker 1: Basically, it's like, you know, gaming was like rain.

25
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,473
Speaker 1: It's like every once in a while it would rain.

26
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:13,155
Speaker 1: It would be like, "Ah,

27
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:13,636
Speaker 1: gaming."

28
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:14,578
Speaker 1: And then it would go away.

29
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:15,160
Speaker 1: It would come back.

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,104
Speaker 1: But lately, there's been a gaming drought.

31
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,670
Speaker 0: So we finally- Well, you know, we go through seasons.

32
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,956
Speaker 1: We got so thirsty, we had to just dig a fucking well.

33
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:23,520
Speaker 1: 'Cause it was not, it wasn't raining.

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,308
Speaker 0: I mean, there was a time we had anime season where I was watching so much anime, it was crazy.

35
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:29,313
Speaker 0: And anime season's coming back a little bit.

36
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:32,400
Speaker 0: I'm, uh, I'm plowing through Fist of the North Star right now.

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

38
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:34,120
Speaker 1: Like, man.

39
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,931
Speaker 1: So I had to use, uh, my personal days by the end of the month at work.

40
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:42,700
Speaker 1: 'Cause the way the company that bought us works is they reset or whatever, right?

41
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,864
Speaker 1: So I took off today and yesterday.

42
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:51,540
Speaker 1: So I was at the grocery store, and since I had more time to go at the grocery store, you know, I've always been disappointed with their bread selection.

43
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,420
Speaker 1: So I was looking more closely in the bread aisle for a superior bread.

44
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,940
Speaker 0: Oh, so you're looking for, like, packaged sliced bread, not, like, the bakery bread.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bread over by the bakery was mad weak at this particular store.

46
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,044
Speaker 0: See, at least I got near me the food seller.

47
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:11,776
Speaker 0: Food sellers basically take Wegmans and make it a quarter the size and a quarter the quality.

48
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:13,780
Speaker 0: So better than everything else, but...

49
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,040
Speaker 1: But basically both Key Food and Associated, which are the two supermarkets near me, have not good bread choice.

50
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,760
Speaker 1: So I was looking really close at all the breads, and I saw some rye breads, packaged rye breads, so they weren't as good as fresh rye breads, obviously.

51
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,157
Speaker 0: Of course.

52
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,300
Speaker 1: But, uh, it was Levy's rye bread, so it was a Jewish brand, at least, right?

53
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:33,978
Speaker 0: I think I've had Levy's.

54
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:41,120
Speaker 1: So I was looking, and I was like, okay, they got rye bread, no seeds, seeds, I think there was even a sesame rye, but then I saw something.

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,497
Speaker 0: Marble?

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,110
Speaker 1: It was the most amazing rye bread I've ever seen.

57
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,060
Speaker 1: It was everything rye bread.

58
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:46,644
Speaker 0: What?

59
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:47,739
Speaker 0: Like, everything bagel?

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,419
Speaker 1: Exactly.

61
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:48,974
Speaker 1: Woah.

62
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,200
Speaker 1: So I got everything rye bread, I was like, aw shit, and, you know, the bread part was, you know, packaged rye bread.

63
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,453
Speaker 1: Yeah.

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,740
Speaker 1: But the everything part was fucking everything.

65
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:03,020
Speaker 1: So I'll be buying that bread more in the future if I can't find anything better.

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,869
Speaker 0: Well, if we're talking food, so, uh, I wandered in a direction I normally don't go.

67
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:11,000
Speaker 0: Like, I usually go toward Bryant Park for lunch, but I went the other way, which I often don't go.

68
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, isn't that weird?

69
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:18,180
Speaker 1: It's like, even at my office, it's like, when we go out for lunch, you always go in one direction, even though there's four directions to go in.

70
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:18,417
Speaker 0: Yup.

71
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,840
Speaker 1: Unless you live on the ocean, or the river.

72
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:26,240
Speaker 1: But usually everyone goes in one direction for lunch, even if they eat at different places in that direction.

73
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:27,710
Speaker 1: I don't know why that is.

74
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:29,060
Speaker 1: Is there a psychological thing about it?

75
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,280
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, for me, I want to go to the park, so I want to eat near the park, even though there's better food in almost every other direction.

76
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,739
Speaker 1: Aren't there, like, other parks?

77
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,968
Speaker 0: Eh, not as good as Bryant Park.

78
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:39,155
Speaker 0: It's pretty much the best park.

79
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:40,060
Speaker 0: that isn't Central Park.

80
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:40,714
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,000
Speaker 0: So, uh, I go over, like, the other way, and there's a Van Mee place that wasn't there before.

82
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:46,474
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

83
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,480
Speaker 0: So I get some Van Mee, and it's really good.

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,558
Speaker 1: Four, four, five, five bucks.

85
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:52,214
Speaker 0: And I'm sitting in, like, Le Pen Côte d'Iene.

86
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:53,200
Speaker 0: They have one over there, too.

87
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,736
Speaker 0: And they have a little, like, thing in the road you can sit on.

88
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:57,560
Speaker 0: that's open to the public.

89
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:59,820
Speaker 0: So I sat there eating my Van Mee, and it was all good and nice.

90
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,799
Speaker 0: And I look up, and you know what I see?

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,129
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm?

92
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,620
Speaker 0: What's the one food that we can't get in this fucking city?

93
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,420
Speaker 1: A fucking sandwich.

94
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,220
Speaker 0: Fucking sandwich.

95
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,978
Speaker 0: Is there a Dibella's?

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,749
Speaker 0: Submarine sandwich.

97
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:09,278
Speaker 0: Not a Dibella's.

98
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:09,899
Speaker 1: Is there a note?

99
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:11,713
Speaker 0: It's half as good as a Dibella's.

100
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:12,580
Speaker 0: We're halfway there.

101
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,500
Speaker 0: Remember that place in Baltimore, that, uh, Potbelly Sandwiches?

102
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:17,980
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's not really a sub place, though.

103
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:18,820
Speaker 1: They have subs, though.

104
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,519
Speaker 1: A barbecue-ish place, wasn't it?

105
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,817
Speaker 0: No, Scott, that place has subs, too.

106
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:22,440
Speaker 0: Alright.

107
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,229
Speaker 0: Straight up subs.

108
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,718
Speaker 0: Good subs.

109
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:24,236
Speaker 0: Alright.

110
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,514
Speaker 0: They're not Dibella's quality.

111
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:25,878
Speaker 0: They're like...

112
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:27,540
Speaker 1: I remember that being a barbecue place.

113
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,232
Speaker 0: 'Cause you, I guess you got the barbecue.

114
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:30,300
Speaker 0: They had straight up subs.

115
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:30,983
Speaker 0: Yeah.

116
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:32,460
Speaker 1: I remember it being primarily barbecue.

117
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:33,879
Speaker 0: You're completely wrong.

118
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,502
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

119
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,171
Speaker 1: Maybe the Baltimore one did.

120
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:37,176
Speaker 1: I remember it having subs.

121
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:37,820
Speaker 1: That's all I'm saying.

122
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:42,052
Speaker 0: Ahem.

123
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:43,450
Speaker 0: Potbelly Sandwiches.

124
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,250
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's the same place.

125
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,560
Speaker 0: It is the same place, Scott.

126
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,670
Speaker 0: It's the exact same place.

127
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,455
Speaker 0: I ate there.

128
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:51,789
Speaker 0: the last Otacon we went to three times.

129
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:52,990
Speaker 0: I don't know.

130
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,409
Speaker 0: The one over by the Hard Rock Cafe.

131
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:56,056
Speaker 1: I know.

132
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:57,230
Speaker 1: I also ate there.

133
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,030
Speaker 0: There's another one on the other side of the convention center, too.

134
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,970
Speaker 1: Alright, I will use their store locator, and then that will settle this deal.

135
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:03,698
Speaker 0: I can't believe.

136
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:04,349
Speaker 0: you don't remember.

137
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:05,917
Speaker 1: Oh, they do.

138
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:07,010
Speaker 1: Maryland is highlighted.

139
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:07,381
Speaker 1: Yeah.

140
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,265
Speaker 1: So let's click on it.

141
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:08,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, bitch.

142
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,850
Speaker 1: Alright, there's Baltimore is highlighted.

143
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:11,200
Speaker 1: Yeah.

144
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:12,428
Speaker 1: Let's click on that.

145
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:20,887
Speaker 0: 'Cause I remember getting The Rec two times and The Italian once, and they are four times better than Quiznos, which means they're half as good as Dibella's.

146
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:23,130
Speaker 1: It does say Inner Harbor.

147
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:24,876
Speaker 0: So what?

148
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:26,150
Speaker 0: There is, Scott.

149
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,489
Speaker 0: Now, there is a barbecue place around there, too.

150
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,209
Speaker 0: That is not this place.

151
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,390
Speaker 0: Though this place did have a barbecue sandwich.

152
00:05:34,054 --> 00:05:34,870
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was this place.

153
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,469
Speaker 1: 'Cause, I don't know.

154
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,070
Speaker 1: You're wrong.

155
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,050
Speaker 1: I think it was the pig in the branding is what makes you think of barbecue.

156
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, there's a barbecue place, too, Scott.

157
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,029
Speaker 0: I just think you're an old man who can't remember stuff.

158
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:44,769
Speaker 1: Anyway.

159
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:45,570
Speaker 0: Anyway.

160
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:46,869
Speaker 1: We haven't been there in a while.

161
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:48,090
Speaker 0: Uh, a couple years.

162
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,510
Speaker 1: It doesn't look like we're going there this year.

163
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,630
Speaker 0: So one of these places is opening in Midtown.

164
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:52,862
Speaker 1: Alright.

165
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,443
Speaker 1: Yeah.

166
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,670
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's not open yet?

167
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,810
Speaker 0: No, 'cause I'm sitting there eating my Banh Mi, and I'm really liking it.

168
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,869
Speaker 1: Well, how do you, I don't know if it's half as good as Dibella's.

169
00:05:59,812 --> 00:06:01,750
Speaker 0: Uh, it's at least a third as good as Dibella's.

170
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe.

171
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:06,744
Speaker 0: But I look up, and I'm eating my Banh Mi, and I'm liking it, but then I see this pot belly, and I'm like, "No way.

172
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:07,428
Speaker 0: No

173
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:07,710
Speaker 0: way.".

174
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:09,685
Speaker 0: And then suddenly, I look at my Banh Mi, and I'm like, "Fuck

175
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:09,947
Speaker 0: this.".

176
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:14,669
Speaker 0: And I walk over there to see if I can, like, get a half sandwich, which is because they're not open yet.

177
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,387
Speaker 0: There's a guy, like, setting up.

178
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:16,839
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

179
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll see.

180
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:18,530
Speaker 1: Alright.

181
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,890
Speaker 0: But I've been playing games, like I said.

182
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,190
Speaker 0: I've been playing some Pac-Man, going up in the ranks.

183
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,610
Speaker 1: What's your world rank in Pac-Man?

184
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,012
Speaker 0: I am 2138th.

185
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm 300-something now.

186
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,509
Speaker 1: I think I used to be 240-something, so it's fine.

187
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:34,830
Speaker 1: That's 'cause I haven't played.

188
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,510
Speaker 0: I look, though, the number of people who hacked their scores at the top is substantially reduced.

189
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,570
Speaker 0: I went in and reported everyone with a hacked score last night.

190
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:41,927
Speaker 1: Nice.

191
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:50,029
Speaker 1: But also, on top of that, it's like, not only have I not played in a while, but I did try to play, like, a couple days ago.

192
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,050
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I can't beat, like, any of my high scores.

193
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,710
Speaker 1: I couldn't beat my own high scores.

194
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,529
Speaker 0: I play it, and I'm like, "What the fuck did I do?

195
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,985
Speaker 0: I'm, like, 4 million short

196
00:06:58,046 --> 00:06:58,248
Speaker 0: here.".

197
00:06:58,491 --> 00:06:59,630
Speaker 1: Well, not 4 million short.

198
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:00,630
Speaker 1: On a 10-minute run.

199
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,903
Speaker 1: I was, like, I was basically 10,000 short.

200
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,504
Speaker 1: I was like, "That was a perfect

201
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:03,809
Speaker 1: run."

202
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:05,590
Speaker 1: And I was 10,000 short on my previous score.

203
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,229
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Well, I really don't know what else I can do

204
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:08,330
Speaker 1: here.".

205
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:13,829
Speaker 0: I was watching some replays of the people who have way better scores than me, and they just fucking die and bomb all the time.

206
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,390
Speaker 0: Like, they'll die and just not even care.

207
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,290
Speaker 1: But what are they, are they following a different path than the one that I feel is the right path?

208
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,910
Speaker 1: What are they, you know, what are they doing to get this higher score?

209
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,970
Speaker 0: My guess, because there's a pattern, and I think they've memorized the pattern of layouts.

210
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,210
Speaker 1: But it's like, I've also memorized the pattern, and I follow it precisely without dying or bombing.

211
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,969
Speaker 1: So how are they getting a higher score than me?

212
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,530
Speaker 0: Probably by dying and bombing.

213
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:39,849
Speaker 1: How does dying and bombing get you a higher score?

214
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:46,590
Speaker 0: Well, what they'll do is they'll start a combo, and then at the end, they'll keep it going on the individual ghosts with pellets in them for a while.

215
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,435
Speaker 1: I do that too.

216
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,570
Speaker 1: I tried that and I actually got a lower score.

217
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, so.

218
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:51,309
Speaker 0: Without dying or bombing.

219
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,030
Speaker 0: I don't know, just keep, watch some replays, you'll see what I mean.

220
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,630
Speaker 0: You'll see people with way better scores just fucking die and keep going.

221
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,210
Speaker 1: I gotta see it, I need, basically the point I can't break is 2 million.

222
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,255
Speaker 1: I can get like 1.8.

223
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:03,670
Speaker 1: I need to see a 2 million video to figure it out.

224
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,951
Speaker 1: But I've been playing a little bit of Team Fortress 2.

225
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:08,015
Speaker 1: Why?

226
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,261
Speaker 0: Because, now hear me out, one, all the listeners are getting into it, and It's 'cause they all suck at games.

227
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:15,730
Speaker 1: They wanna play baby games.

228
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,110
Speaker 0: This is where I always disagree with you, because Team Fortress 2 was not for me.

229
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,596
Speaker 0: It was not for us.

230
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,109
Speaker 1: It is, you know, it's kind of like You wanna hear some bad news?

231
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:25,930
Speaker 1: That tribes ascend?

232
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:28,470
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't even, I just assumed bad news.

233
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,224
Speaker 1: It's gonna be?

234
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:29,942
Speaker 1: An MMO?

235
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,049
Speaker 1: Free to play, and where you buy more weapons and shit.

236
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,370
Speaker 0: Oh my god, we need to do a show on this.

237
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,789
Speaker 1: It's basically gonna be a free game, but you can buy different weapons loadouts.

238
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,570
Speaker 0: Free to play is euphemism for, we're trying to trick 13 year olds into buying hats.

239
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:44,290
Speaker 1: Every free to play game is gun bound.

240
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,930
Speaker 0: Yup, and you know what, gun bound?

241
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,410
Speaker 1: Also, what's that, the Korean kart racing thing, they're all the same.

242
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,450
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, oh my god, gun bound was really fun until the money came in and we all quit.

243
00:08:52,830 --> 00:09:02,789
Speaker 1: I think that's what's really disappointing, is that some of these free to play games would be awesome if they would just sell them for 50 bucks and give you every downloaded thing instead of being free to play.

244
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:08,268
Speaker 0: At least when we were playing, it had, you could play on vanilla matches.

245
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:12,130
Speaker 0: that didn't, they still had the items for money, but the items had no game effect.

246
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:12,948
Speaker 1: That is true.

247
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,290
Speaker 0: So you could still play the perfect game and not worry about the money bullshit.

248
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,129
Speaker 1: That would be cool.

249
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,129
Speaker 0: It's not, there aren't so many Team Fortress servers doing the same thing.

250
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:23,050
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know Team Fortress had that option.

251
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,270
Speaker 1: Supposedly there is a way.

252
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,029
Speaker 1: Is there a way to turn off all hats and all extra weapons, or give everyone all hats and all extra weapons?

253
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,969
Speaker 0: Supposedly there is a way to run a server in vanilla mode.

254
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,510
Speaker 1: Really?

255
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,050
Speaker 1: Does that give everyone everything or does it take everything away from everyone?

256
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,630
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

257
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:37,490
Speaker 1: Because there is a significant difference.

258
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,549
Speaker 0: Honestly, I would be fine with either, but I would prefer nothing.

259
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,990
Speaker 1: But even if you do that, the game is still slow.

260
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,450
Speaker 0: Nah, yeah, slow, but here's the thing.

261
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,089
Speaker 1: Everyone's bottles are really big.

262
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,911
Speaker 0: There's two, like I had two primary complaints about Team Fortress 2.

263
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:54,950
Speaker 0: One is that they got stateful bullshit on my stateless competition game.

264
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,569
Speaker 0: I even filed a trouble ticket with Steam when they first did that.

265
00:09:58,516 --> 00:09:59,330
Speaker 0: They never responded.

266
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:00,109
Speaker 1: No, they don't care.

267
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:02,410
Speaker 0: But two, that the game wasn't for us.

268
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,725
Speaker 0: It's not a hardcore FPS in FPS.

269
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,530
Speaker 1: They should have just called it something else instead of Team Fortress 2.

270
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,750
Speaker 0: But it's still a good game for what it is, as I've always said.

271
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,109
Speaker 0: And I enjoyed playing it.

272
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,169
Speaker 1: It's a funny game.

273
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,090
Speaker 1: I like watching videos about meeting various guys.

274
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,948
Speaker 1: Here's my analogy.

275
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:26,030
Speaker 0: Playing Team Fortress 2 is for the same kinds of people, like me, who play Yomi to get the high level Street Fighter experience.

276
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:30,510
Speaker 0: I will never be good enough at Street Fighter for any of that strategy.

277
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:41,370
Speaker 1: You're saying that people who want to be good at an FPS but they suck and they don't really want to learn or build any skills can play Team Fortress 2 and feel like they have skills.

278
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,230
Speaker 0: See, I'm actually saying one thing under that.

279
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,530
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is that I admit that I'm not super good at Street Fighter.

280
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,410
Speaker 1: No kidding.

281
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:49,470
Speaker 0: I'm not the best at that game.

282
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,550
Speaker 1: Me either, really.

283
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,409
Speaker 0: But you're an order of magnitude better than me.

284
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,108
Speaker 1: Only one.

285
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:56,649
Speaker 0: And I'm an order of magnitude better than babies who have never played games before.

286
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,489
Speaker 1: There's still 20 orders of magnitude above me.

287
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,797
Speaker 1: It's the same even with FPSs.

288
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:08,090
Speaker 1: I try to play hardcore quote FPSs like Counter-Strike or NS, which are significantly harder than Team Fortress 2.

289
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,990
Speaker 0: Oh, I'll be on a nub server of Counter-Strike and wreck everybody.

290
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,770
Speaker 0: And then I'll be on a clan match and I won't even kill a single person.

291
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:16,470
Speaker 1: I'm still better.

292
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,410
Speaker 1: It's the same level that I am in Street Fighter.

293
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,709
Speaker 1: I'm better than a lot of people.

294
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:21,830
Speaker 1: But there's tons and tons of people better than me.

295
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,646
Speaker 1: If I play NS, I just get hosed plenty.

296
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:26,310
Speaker 1: If I play Counter-Strike, I get hosed.

297
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,329
Speaker 1: I don't win a gun game, really, ever.

298
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, but all I'm saying is that it's the same experience for people who play Yomi.

299
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,450
Speaker 0: Where you can at least play all the high level stuff of an FPS like that.

300
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,105
Speaker 1: So an FPS is testing many skills and this removes two or three of those skill tests.

301
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,750
Speaker 0: But it keeps the rest.

302
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,929
Speaker 0: Because look at the old Team Fortress or Weapons Factory and all that.

303
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:57,409
Speaker 0: Those tested FPS skills if you define those as clicking on the other guy's head and rocket jumping around crazily with a grappling hook.

304
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,269
Speaker 0: Which is awesome and I like that stuff.

305
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,310
Speaker 0: But it also tested team coordination.

306
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,310
Speaker 0: You know, class, balance, loadout, the paper, rock, scissors.

307
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:06,470
Speaker 0: Tactical disposition.

308
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:08,130
Speaker 1: So is this your news you're talking about here?

309
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,809
Speaker 1: The fact that Team Fortress 2 is free to play now?

310
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,750
Speaker 0: No, I'm just saying that I've been playing it because our listeners have been playing it and they made a server.

311
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,930
Speaker 0: And funny thing about Team Fortress 2, I was playing and it was working okay.

312
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:20,535
Speaker 0: Then I looked.

313
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,170
Speaker 0: I had a ping of like two fucking hundred.

314
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:23,430
Speaker 1: And it didn't matter.

315
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,310
Speaker 1: I guess it doesn't matter because the game is so slow and the model is just so big.

316
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:39,230
Speaker 0: But I'm going to keep playing it a bit with the listeners because I enjoy the game when I'm playing it and not playing it for the FPS skill click on the head aspect but for all the other aspects.

317
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:43,290
Speaker 0: That part of it was only ruined because of the stateful bullshit.

318
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:46,147
Speaker 0: And you can mitigate that by playing with nubs.

319
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,209
Speaker 0: And most of our listeners are nubs.

320
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:48,817
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

321
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:49,790
Speaker 1: That's why they like team games.

322
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,010
Speaker 0: You can also mitigate it by playing scrims where you're playing a real match.

323
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,130
Speaker 0: Like, alright, we've got two teams where we chose the teams ahead of time.

324
00:12:56,351 --> 00:13:00,630
Speaker 0: We're playing on real maps as in not two-fort where everybody turtles for an hour.

325
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,210
Speaker 0: And it's actually kind of fun, especially with all talk on.

326
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:05,750
Speaker 1: I don't know why people turtle for an hour.

327
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,990
Speaker 1: If I was playing two-fort and my people were actually organized, right?

328
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,590
Speaker 0: Well, no, you turtle for 59 minutes and then you rush and then turtle again.

329
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,010
Speaker 0: Rush turtle.

330
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:20,430
Speaker 1: But the thing is if my people were actually organized, right, what I would do is I would set up the invincible defense with the engineers and snipers, right, out in the front.

331
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:26,050
Speaker 1: And then I would have the entire rest of the team basically constantly rush in a group, right?

332
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,379
Speaker 1: So it's rush water, go.

333
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:28,829
Speaker 1: Rush top, go.

334
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:34,250
Speaker 0: And at least in clan matches back in the day, there's a slightly more nuanced strategy.

335
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,259
Speaker 1: You could also do the split rush.

336
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,044
Speaker 0: Half water, half top.

337
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,430
Speaker 0: No, you do constant harassment to wear down their will.

338
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:43,548
Speaker 0: And then every now and then...

339
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:45,285
Speaker 1: But they respawn instantly.

340
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:45,689
Speaker 1: so you can't...

341
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:46,570
Speaker 0: You wear them down.

342
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,570
Speaker 0: You don't respawn instantly.

343
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,330
Speaker 1: You respawn really quickly.

344
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,829
Speaker 0: No, it's actually, there's a significant delay.

345
00:13:51,130 --> 00:14:00,190
Speaker 0: And a big part of games like that is when you've killed enough of the team, you suddenly kill your defense, go almost all offense with like one pyro in the basement.

346
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,447
Speaker 0: You go all out offense cap once and then turtle 100% for a few minutes.

347
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:04,771
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's.

348
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:13,849
Speaker 1: another thing is if you can set up, right, a crazy powerful defense in the back near the intelligence, right, then you actually can just not put any defense on the fort at all.

349
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:14,835
Speaker 0: That depends.

350
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:17,430
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't want to talk about Team Fortress much longer.

351
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:30,489
Speaker 0: But suffice it to say, if you play on the bigger maps, and you don't want it to be a game about clicking and FPS skills and all that stuff, and you want it to be about all the other things, and you play on a vanilla server or a password-protected server, it is kind of fun.

352
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:34,830
Speaker 0: And we're going to do some team-based for real scrims after Connecticut.

353
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,690
Speaker 1: If you want to play a man's game... Well, here's the deal.

354
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,928
Speaker 1: We're still playing NS1 over here.

355
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:40,450
Speaker 0: Here's the deal.

356
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:53,230
Speaker 0: If the listeners, and they're coming up to the challenge, especially Naito, make this scrim for real, we pick teams with team captains and do it happen, I have committed to making the for real Counter-Strike server and doing the same thing.

357
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:54,802
Speaker 1: All right, Counter-Strike is playable.

358
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:55,609
Speaker 1: I'll do that.

359
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,090
Speaker 0: Because I'm getting that new HTPC, so I'm going to run the server on that.

360
00:14:59,370 --> 00:14:59,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

361
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:00,610
Speaker 1: Yeah.

362
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:06,289
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of gaming news, actually, like the Supreme Court saying video games are absolutely free speech.

363
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:06,730
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

364
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:07,145
Speaker 1: Oh my.

365
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,508
Speaker 1: Which I knew that was going to happen.

366
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:09,570
Speaker 1: Glad it happened.

367
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:11,788
Speaker 1: Every time it's ever gone to court, pretty much.

368
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:17,288
Speaker 1: The thing is, two justices were dicks, so we know who's a jerk.

369
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,997
Speaker 0: The thing is only two.

370
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,050
Speaker 0: Usually it's like five to four.

371
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,090
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, when it's a free speech issue, it's all like, go look at the history.

372
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:27,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, we pretty much never lose the free speech issues.

373
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:28,810
Speaker 1: Right, anyway.

374
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,670
Speaker 1: But the thing is, there's not much to say about it, except like, you know, hell's yeah.

375
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,151
Speaker 0: Duh.

376
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:36,210
Speaker 0: Kind of like gay marriage in New York, like duh.

377
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:39,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I want to talk about Geekvite, right?

378
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,080
Speaker 1: So this game came out called Fear 3.

379
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,722
Speaker 1: I didn't play that.

380
00:15:44,364 --> 00:15:46,650
Speaker 1: What I did play was Fear 1 and 2.

381
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,790
Speaker 0: Oh, I think I bought that pack.

382
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:54,550
Speaker 1: Because there was a pack on Steam, it was like ten bucks for both games and all their expansions and add-ons and DLCs and everything.

383
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:55,430
Speaker 1: So I was like, all right.

384
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,790
Speaker 1: And I had played the Fear 1 demo when it first came out, when it was a brand new game.

385
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,690
Speaker 1: So now it's an old game and my computer is much newer, so I can play this game awesomely.

386
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,690
Speaker 1: So I beat all of Fear 1, the whole thing, yep.

387
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,409
Speaker 1: And this is what I have to say about it, because I got a lot to say about it, actually.

388
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,890
Speaker 1: So it's a single player FPS, so if you don't like single player FPS already, don't bother, right?

389
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,130
Speaker 1: Number two, it borrows a lot from Half-Life, actually, right?

390
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,070
Speaker 1: In that there's a story that's sort of integrated with the game, kind of.

391
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,007
Speaker 1: Not as well as Half-Life, but kind of.

392
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:33,630
Speaker 1: The major selling point of the game is how the AI is "smarter," right?

393
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,950
Speaker 1: But it's not actually smarter, it just does things that make it look smarter.

394
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,030
Speaker 1: Like it'll poke its head around from behind walls or run and jump over some furniture.

395
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,802
Speaker 0: What do you mean, like most AIs?

396
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:50,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, it basically makes all the enemies look like they're doing smarter things, like knocking over furniture and hiding behind it.

397
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,548
Speaker 1: When they're not actually any smarter than the guys in, say, Half-Life 2, right?

398
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,108
Speaker 1: You know, you still just own them all.

399
00:16:57,872 --> 00:17:01,970
Speaker 1: One problem with the game is that it's much too long, or at least it feels much too long.

400
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:10,930
Speaker 1: That could be because there's a lot of really repetitive parts where it's like going through an office building, fighting the same soldiers over and over again for like a half hour.

401
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:12,769
Speaker 0: Ah, see, this is where good design comes in.

402
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,970
Speaker 0: Half-Life 1 and 2, every time I started to get bored, suddenly shit changed.

403
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:22,150
Speaker 1: They need to compress a lot of it, you know, so that the plot moves more quickly.

404
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,230
Speaker 1: Well, not the plot, but the game moves more quickly, right?

405
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,089
Speaker 1: You get more different things happening more often.

406
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,710
Speaker 1: They borrowed a lot of other design things from Half-Life also.

407
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,910
Speaker 1: Like, you get to see a bad guy from a vantage point, but you don't get to fight him, and then later you fight him, right?

408
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,590
Speaker 1: So you get to see him and see what he's all about before you get, you know, all that good design stuff.

409
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:46,370
Speaker 1: The game lets you poke your head around from behind corners, right?

410
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:48,470
Speaker 1: There's like two buttons, you can lean left or lean right.

411
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:52,091
Speaker 1: I hadn't played a game with those controls since Soldier of Fortune 1.

412
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:53,930
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I remember that game.

413
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:15,389
Speaker 1: So, uh, I was like, I was getting used to it again, and, you know, being much wiser now than when Soldier of Fortune 1 came out, I realized this causes sort of a problem in that basically what you do is you go up, in order to make the lean the way they implemented it actually work well, you basically have to stand at the edge of a wall, facing the wall so you can't see anything but the wall, and then lean.

414
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:19,370
Speaker 1: And that allows you to poke your head out while still having the maximum cover.

415
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,210
Speaker 1: You know, leaning otherwise doesn't really do anything for you.

416
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,870
Speaker 0: So wait until we get every FPS supporting that head-mounted thing that RMA uses to look around corners?

417
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,070
Speaker 1: Right, but this is leaning your whole body to the left or to the right.

418
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:37,850
Speaker 1: So like, you can be up against the edge of a hallway and sort of put half your torso around the corner to shoot, right?

419
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,450
Speaker 1: I don't know why they don't just let you hold the gun in your left hand and shoot wildly without being able to hit anything around the corner.

420
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,942
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, it's possible, right?

421
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:47,610
Speaker 1: It's not gonna be too successful.

422
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,730
Speaker 1: You're probably just gonna, you know, the gun will probably just fly off your hand.

423
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,590
Speaker 0: I would argue it's primarily contextual feature button creep.

424
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.

425
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,650
Speaker 1: But anyway, so that changed the game a lot.

426
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:03,650
Speaker 1: But the one thing that changed the game the most, and I think is the game's major flaw, right, is that they let you save whenever the fuck you want.

427
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,137
Speaker 1: You can just quick save all the time.

428
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,530
Speaker 1: So basically, any time you go into a situation...

429
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,530
Speaker 0: I think I could do that in Half-Life 1 and 2, though.

430
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:12,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically, it's really easy to hit the button.

431
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,770
Speaker 1: So basically, I would go into a situation, right, because the game is like quiet action, quiet action, quiet action.

432
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:21,370
Speaker 1: And if I didn't perform perfectly, I'd just be like, eh, load.

433
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,530
Speaker 0: That's how I got good at Doom 2.

434
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, eh, load.

435
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,540
Speaker 1: Eh, shoot.

436
00:19:25,902 --> 00:19:27,530
Speaker 1: Oh, I hosed all the guys, you know.

437
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,350
Speaker 1: But to make it worse, on top of that, right, you have this slow motion ability.

438
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,190
Speaker 1: So basically, you can turn everything into matrix time, right?

439
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:39,790
Speaker 1: Now, and it's a meter, so it runs out, and then you have to stand and wait for it to recharge.

440
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,550
Speaker 1: So of course, during all the quiet times, you wait for it to recharge fully before you continue.

441
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,150
Speaker 1: And that's what makes the game feel longer, I think, is that you're constantly sitting there waiting for it to recharge.

442
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,601
Speaker 1: Because, why wouldn't you?

443
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,450
Speaker 1: Right?

444
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,310
Speaker 1: If you're sitting there quietly, why wouldn't you wait for it to recharge?

445
00:19:53,390 --> 00:20:01,230
Speaker 0: That is the problem with every game that has ever given you the ability to wait and have stuff recharge, that didn't pull an Ultima and randomly attack you all the time.

446
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:10,750
Speaker 1: Now the other thing, right, is they expect you, right, to turn on this slow motion ability, go into a room full of guys and hose them all down while the slow motion ability runs out.

447
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:19,990
Speaker 1: And there's some situations where they give you so many bad guys in one area, that you wouldn't be able to keep the slow motion power running while also killing all the guys.

448
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,110
Speaker 0: You run in, kill them, run out, wait.

449
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:24,629
Speaker 1: No, it's even more simple than that.

450
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,830
Speaker 1: Because once you get, right, basically what the slow motion ability really is, is remove all aiming skill.

451
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:35,790
Speaker 1: Because what you do is basically you see a bad guy, you tap the button, he basically pauses.

452
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,389
Speaker 1: Because he's going so slow, but you're still going full speed.

453
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,770
Speaker 1: So basically, pause, shoot, unpause.

454
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,561
Speaker 1: Every single bad guy in the whole game.

455
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,690
Speaker 1: Pause, shoot, unpause.

456
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,289
Speaker 1: You can basically get headshots on every single guy, because you can pause them.

457
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,370
Speaker 1: So you just pause them really quick, you use like a tiny fraction of the slow motion meter.

458
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,866
Speaker 1: So basically, pause, headshot, unpause, pause, headshot, unpause.

459
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:55,610
Speaker 1: It never runs out.

460
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:59,350
Speaker 0: Ahh, so, this is where game theory would have helped the game developer.

461
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:01,690
Speaker 0: And you can never, you basically never lose.

462
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:07,749
Speaker 1: You know, unless, the only time you can lose is if you run out into a room where there's too many bad guys and they can all shoot you.

463
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,050
Speaker 0: Did you play on the highest difficulty?

464
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,450
Speaker 1: Ahh, so I tried the higher, I played on normal difficulty, because that's what I usually want to play on.

465
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,609
Speaker 1: Because easy is boring.

466
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:18,350
Speaker 0: And hard is usually unfair hacks.

467
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,469
Speaker 1: Hard is unfair nightmare mode, right?

468
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:22,490
Speaker 1: So I tried the harder difficulties, right?

469
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,330
Speaker 1: And the harder difficulties give you a lot more bad guys, and a lot less resources.

470
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,550
Speaker 1: So ammo and health become a factor.

471
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,250
Speaker 1: And, you know, you get hit, it does more damage and things like that, right?

472
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,330
Speaker 1: But, the same basic strategy pretty much held tight.

473
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,170
Speaker 1: It's just the game went even slower, because there would be more bad guys.

474
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:47,230
Speaker 1: So it'd be like, pause, shoot, unpause, pause, shoot, unpause, for five minutes to shoot all these guys that are down the other side of the hallway.

475
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:52,250
Speaker 1: Instead of, you know, two minutes to shoot the other guys at the other end of the hallway, because there are twice as many of them.

476
00:21:52,350 --> 00:22:02,670
Speaker 0: So game theory would have helped this, because the game designers clearly did not, like they designed the game for a certain skill set, but did not also consider what happens if a guy plays perfectly.

477
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:05,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, and plus, you know, if I screwed up, right?

478
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:17,330
Speaker 1: And I, you know, as I got later in the game, it actually was getting easier, not because they made the difficulty easier, but because my skills at pause, shoot, unpause were increasing, because I had more practice.

479
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:22,590
Speaker 0: Dude, with the fancy mouse, you could make that automatic, like you click, it pauses, you let go, it shoots and unpauses.

480
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:23,832
Speaker 1: Yeah.

481
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:29,930
Speaker 1: One other thing about the game, right, is that they did give you this limitation that you could only have three weapons at once, right?

482
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:30,494
Speaker 1: Huh.

483
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,221
Speaker 1: So it's like, and the thing was, I actually caught myself being stupid.

484
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:36,630
Speaker 1: I had a rocket launcher with zero ammo in it, right?

485
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,923
Speaker 1: So I was like, I don't want to get rid of the rocket launcher, right?

486
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:40,806
Speaker 1: Because that's, right?

487
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,429
Speaker 1: Because what am I going to- It's a rocket launcher!

488
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,379
Speaker 1: But the thing is, nowhere in the game is there ammo lying around.

489
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:47,341
Speaker 1: There's only guns.

490
00:22:47,722 --> 00:22:51,310
Speaker 1: So the only way I could get more rocket launcher ammo was with another rocket launcher.

491
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:54,908
Speaker 1: So if I had the rocket launcher with zero ammo, I was like, why am I holding onto this?

492
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:55,230
Speaker 1: Goodbye.

493
00:22:55,911 --> 00:22:59,343
Speaker 1: There's no reason to hold onto it because there's nowhere I'm going to find box of rockets.

494
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:01,150
Speaker 1: I'm only going to find rocket launcher.

495
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:06,589
Speaker 1: So if I was going to find ammo for the rocket launcher, there was guaranteed to be a rocket launcher accompanying it.

496
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:13,370
Speaker 1: So there was no reason not to get rid of it and pick up, you know, a submachine gun temporarily to fill that spot, you know?

497
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,850
Speaker 1: Fear 2, I only started playing today, so I'll talk about that at some other time.

498
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:27,710
Speaker 1: But basically, if you want a single player FPS that is sort of flawed, it has parts that are supposed to be scary, but they're not actually.

499
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,916
Speaker 1: They just jump out, go boo a couple times.

500
00:23:30,938 --> 00:23:35,170
Speaker 1: A plot that's not really all that exciting, it's just typical.

501
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:42,370
Speaker 1: But you get to shoot guys that are doing cool stuff, you know, for many hours, you can get this game.

502
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,990
Speaker 1: Because, you know, while it wasn't the greatest, I think the price was appropriate, which was like two dollars.

503
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, well speaking of price, this is, I'll talk about this briefly because I want to get to it.

504
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,809
Speaker 1: And I just really felt like shooting guys.

505
00:23:54,211 --> 00:24:01,110
Speaker 0: So Capcom supposedly is releasing a game, Resident Evil Mercenaries 3D for the 3DS, that has one save slot.

506
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,910
Speaker 0: That cannot be overwritten by any means on the cartridge.

507
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,050
Speaker 1: So there's no way to say new game start from the beginning?

508
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:08,768
Speaker 1: No way.

509
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,160
Speaker 1: So wait, if I beat the game, I can't start over?

510
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,073
Speaker 0: See, now we don't know.

511
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:17,430
Speaker 0: Maybe you start over with all your achievements or whatever.

512
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:23,690
Speaker 1: So that's usually the way Resident Evil works, is you beat it, but you keep playing it over and over again to get more weapons and all sorts of other stuff.

513
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

514
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:29,550
Speaker 1: And then eventually by the third time you've beaten it, you go through from the beginning again and you're like fucking, you know.

515
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,710
Speaker 0: Now we don't know the details.

516
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,709
Speaker 1: Guns, lots of guns.

517
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,990
Speaker 0: What bothers me about this is that there are games that did stuff like this in the past.

518
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,890
Speaker 0: Like, there were dungeon crawls, you know, kind of 3D modern roguelikes.

519
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,186
Speaker 0: But what they would do is...

520
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,550
Speaker 1: You die, they would delete your save game.

521
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,689
Speaker 0: Yep, you could put them on hardcore mode and if you die...

522
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,589
Speaker 1: Door fortresses like that.

523
00:24:48,772 --> 00:24:48,858
Speaker 1: Yeah.

524
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,610
Speaker 0: And that sort of mechanic is the kind of thing that I hate but also love.

525
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,914
Speaker 1: Diablo 2 had that.

526
00:24:56,974 --> 00:25:00,468
Speaker 1: If you played on real battle net and you didn't cheat and you died...

527
00:25:01,336 --> 00:25:02,290
Speaker 0: If you didn't cheat.

528
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:02,761
Speaker 1: Everyone cheated.

529
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:08,710
Speaker 1: If you were the rare person who played Diablo 2 in the hardcore mode on battle net... If you were a unicorn.

530
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,390
Speaker 1: And you died, then your character would actually be gone, gone forever.

531
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,135
Speaker 1: They should do that.

532
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:14,549
Speaker 1: They should make a World of Warcraft that's hardcore.

533
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,809
Speaker 0: Make any MMO that does something cool like that.

534
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, hardcore World of Warcraft.

535
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:19,681
Speaker 1: Imagine that.

536
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:20,205
Speaker 1: You die?

537
00:25:20,406 --> 00:25:20,910
Speaker 1: No, really?

538
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,275
Speaker 1: Your character is dead.

539
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:25,650
Speaker 1: All your stuff is lying is where your character died.

540
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,550
Speaker 1: So if you die when you're a nub, you could maybe go and rescue your stuff, your five coppers.

541
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,590
Speaker 1: But if you're an awesome dude, you probably died in some dungeon somewhere.

542
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:37,870
Speaker 1: Maybe some other awesome dude is going to get your shit but not you because you're now a nub again.

543
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,655
Speaker 1: You're level zero.

544
00:25:38,735 --> 00:25:40,749
Speaker 1: Good luck going to that dungeon and getting your stuff back.

545
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:45,545
Speaker 0: Or maybe they would do something like this to do some really cool meta aspect of a game.

546
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:49,636
Speaker 1: I might even play that.

547
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:51,825
Speaker 1: Even if they only did it on a particular server.

548
00:25:51,845 --> 00:25:56,470
Speaker 1: that was the hardcore server, I might play that because it wouldn't be about how much time you've played.

549
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:59,330
Speaker 0: If there's a guy who's a high level badass, damn.

550
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:03,049
Speaker 1: That means he played the game that long without ever dying, ever.

551
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,250
Speaker 1: And everyone would play so carefully.

552
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,210
Speaker 0: That you could use something a mechanic like this.

553
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,570
Speaker 1: And turn PvP on because it would become much more meaningful.

554
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:14,570
Speaker 0: Would be if you have one of those games like One Shot where you've got one shot to do something.

555
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,630
Speaker 0: Like the whole point of the game is...

556
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,249
Speaker 1: Well, doesn't Spy Party have that, right?

557
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,069
Speaker 1: You got one shot to shoot the right guy?

558
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:22,510
Speaker 0: Well, I meant in terms of forever.

559
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,249
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

560
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,570
Speaker 0: But that does not appear to be what they're doing.

561
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:32,630
Speaker 0: And the discussion about this game is basically coming down to Capcom's trying to kill used video game sales.

562
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:33,730
Speaker 1: Oh.

563
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:35,989
Speaker 0: I would bet that that's actually what they're trying to do.

564
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:36,550
Speaker 0: Probably.

565
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:41,130
Speaker 0: Because, and we've talked about this before, but I'm gonna say this absolutely unequivocally.

566
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:47,330
Speaker 0: I believe 100% that piracy has never been the threat to media in America.

567
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,249
Speaker 0: Especially games.

568
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:58,410
Speaker 0: Secondhand sales and previously made games that aren't worth money anymore are way more damaging to the modern industry than piracy ever was and ever will be.

569
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,130
Speaker 1: I don't think they're damaging to the industry.

570
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,830
Speaker 0: Well, they're damaging... Scott, Scott, they're damaging to the current industry and the way it works.

571
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:11,830
Speaker 0: In bed, if you sell a game for $50, people will wait until it's $5 because they're not in a hurry to play it.

572
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:13,129
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.

573
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,290
Speaker 1: Because someone pirates it, right?

574
00:27:15,411 --> 00:27:17,250
Speaker 1: Because they wouldn't have paid for it.

575
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,909
Speaker 1: If they would have paid for it, they pay for it.

576
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's part of it.

577
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:27,010
Speaker 1: So, the people who are buying and selling used games are mostly punk kids and they go through this cycle.

578
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,230
Speaker 1: You know, the heaviest used game buyers are these GameStop kids.

579
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,810
Speaker 0: They buy one game, they sell it back.

580
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:33,809
Speaker 0: Buy a game, sell it back.

581
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:40,090
Speaker 1: They get a game for Christmas, they sell it to the, they beat it, they sell it to the store, they buy a used game, they get a whole bunch of games, they sell them back.

582
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,810
Speaker 1: Maybe they borrow games or steal games or who knows what they do.

583
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,870
Speaker 1: But they get games, they don't have money because they're punk kids.

584
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:54,190
Speaker 1: They sell games and they keep, they basically go into this used game cycling and basically GameStop is, you know, taking off percentages in every one of these rotating transactions.

585
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,308
Speaker 0: So, these kids would never buy full-priced games.

586
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,769
Speaker 0: No, no, no, let me put it this way.

587
00:27:59,171 --> 00:28:05,070
Speaker 0: The impact of that versus piracy are the same, if in the end, for by most accounts I would argue.

588
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:13,570
Speaker 0: The difference is that there are also people like me who will just buy games old or used because I'm in no hurry for just about any game.

589
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:25,530
Speaker 0: And that, you know, used sales and packs and all these things, they're hurting the current industry in the sense that the current industry probably overvalues what games are actually worth to gamers.

590
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,240
Speaker 1: Well, Nintendo specifically, right?

591
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,748
Speaker 1: I mean, Nintendo is saying...

592
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, tell that to Nintendo laughing all the way to the bank.

593
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,293
Speaker 1: Well, Iwata has said as much.

594
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:37,530
Speaker 1: He's like, look, you know, selling these games for a dollar and stuff, it's like, you know, you're devaluing games, right?

595
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,666
Speaker 0: But at the same time, people who don't value games enough to care don't care.

596
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,750
Speaker 0: They're going to buy the dollar game.

597
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,252
Speaker 1: That's right.

598
00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:46,249
Speaker 1: And they're not going to buy a $50 game no matter how awesome it is.

599
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:52,990
Speaker 0: But what really bothers me is that something really enshrined in commerce in the United States is the idea of the right to first sale.

600
00:28:53,431 --> 00:29:02,050
Speaker 0: And it pisses me off that digital distribution is killing that, of all things, and that gaming companies are actively trying to kill it directly with technological measures.

601
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,970
Speaker 0: This being one tiny step among many.

602
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:10,430
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter because people are just going to pirate this game and they'll be able to start over again.

603
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,610
Speaker 0: The best part is Capcom, there was an outrage, so Capcom made a statement.

604
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:20,627
Speaker 0: Quote, "The game's value at second hand in the UK is not affected by whether or not the game can have its data

605
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:20,988
Speaker 0: reset.".

606
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:24,036
Speaker 1: I guess sort of, right?

607
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:27,550
Speaker 1: I mean, as long as you can start the game from the beginning, right?

608
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,261
Speaker 1: Then, let's say I get someone's copy of Resident Evil 4, right?

609
00:29:32,462 --> 00:29:33,686
Speaker 1: For instance, it's a great game.

610
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:35,070
Speaker 1: Probably the best Resident Evil.

611
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:36,749
Speaker 0: I didn't beat it, but you know what, it was pretty fun.

612
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,874
Speaker 1: It was really good.

613
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,350
Speaker 1: And let's say I was forced to play with their memory card.

614
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,670
Speaker 1: So the game, I already had all these weapons and unlock things, right?

615
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:50,210
Speaker 1: But, I can still start the game from the beginning and play it straight through just as some guns unlocked and some other shit like that.

616
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,470
Speaker 1: That's fine, if I'm paying a used price, do I really care?

617
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,699
Speaker 0: Now it depends obviously on what they actually do.

618
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,928
Speaker 0: I mean, what if you can't change your name, for example, or something?

619
00:29:58,948 --> 00:29:59,249
Speaker 0: We don't know.

620
00:29:59,370 --> 00:29:59,989
Speaker 0: Who cares, it's just a name.

621
00:30:00,473 --> 00:30:01,509
Speaker 0: A lot of people care about that.

622
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:07,350
Speaker 1: Now, it would be really weird if you had an online multiplayer component and you had to use their profile.

623
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:09,840
Speaker 1: But, that's tied to an Xbox Live account.

624
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,367
Speaker 1: But, this is 3DS, so that's not going to happen.

625
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,697
Speaker 1: Now, imagine this though.

626
00:30:14,797 --> 00:30:17,110
Speaker 1: Imagine if it wasn't a game like Resident Evil.

627
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,465
Speaker 1: Imagine if it was Pokemon where you could never undo the game.

628
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:22,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, Nintendo.

629
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,238
Speaker 1: You can't start Pokemon from the beginning.

630
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:26,390
Speaker 1: If you couldn't start Pokemon again from the beginning.

631
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,590
Speaker 0: Oh, can't farm the starters.

632
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,861
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't go back to the starting Pokemon.

633
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,290
Speaker 1: You know, you pick it and it's locked.

634
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,770
Speaker 0: I'm just waiting for Nintendo.

635
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:39,103
Speaker 1: If you sell me your used game, the Elite Four is already open.

636
00:30:39,123 --> 00:30:41,250
Speaker 1: I can't re-experience the plot ever.

637
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,354
Speaker 0: I'll be perfectly honest.

638
00:30:43,795 --> 00:30:49,690
Speaker 0: If Nintendo did that, my prediction is that they would sell surprisingly more copies of Pokemon.

639
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:52,850
Speaker 1: I actually have to agree that, you know.

640
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:53,810
Speaker 1: There would be outrage.

641
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:56,590
Speaker 1: All the normal people wouldn't even know there was a problem.

642
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,870
Speaker 0: The hardcore people would buy it anyway because it's Pokemon.

643
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:00,956
Speaker 1: They would just buy Poke.

644
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:05,430
Speaker 1: All the Poke kids were just normal kids and aren't smart enough to get like a piracy card, right?

645
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,590
Speaker 1: You just buy it as normal, so they would sell the same number.

646
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:16,030
Speaker 1: All the hardcore people would buy three copies or more or get more to farm starters because you couldn't trade your friend's starter.

647
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:18,038
Speaker 1: Then they lose their starter.

648
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,650
Speaker 1: You need to buy three copies for three starters.

649
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,870
Speaker 0: And now you've got this copy.

650
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,752
Speaker 1: And you know what they could do?

651
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:29,490
Speaker 1: They could put three different starters in the two different colors and people would have to buy six copies to get six starters.

652
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,352
Speaker 0: You see the evil?

653
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:31,836
Speaker 0: This is why I talked about this.

654
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:36,850
Speaker 0: This wouldn't be news except that there are so many ways to be such a dick.

655
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,110
Speaker 1: And then you've got five copies of Pokemon that have no starter.

656
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,830
Speaker 0: And no resale value.

657
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,052
Speaker 0: Well, actually... Well, no.

658
00:31:43,113 --> 00:31:44,570
Speaker 0: You resell them to people who don't know better.

659
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,654
Speaker 1: Well, what you could do, right?

660
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:50,010
Speaker 1: If you started a game, you traded the starter for something else, right?

661
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:54,890
Speaker 1: So basically, you could trade a level one Spiritomb to somebody for their starter.

662
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,266
Speaker 1: And now, basically, that's a used game that has a different starter Pokemon in it.

663
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:00,350
Speaker 1: that is not usually a starter Pokemon.

664
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,906
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a Pokekid's gonna be like, "Yeah, so I don't get the real starter?

665
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:03,148
Speaker 0: Fuck

666
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:03,309
Speaker 0: you!".

667
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:03,966
Speaker 1: But maybe...

668
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,458
Speaker 0: "Fuck you, old

669
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:04,805
Speaker 0: man!".

670
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:05,774
Speaker 1: Yeah.

671
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:09,190
Speaker 1: That kid would have to go out if he wants to finish his Pokedexes to buy three more.

672
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:19,290
Speaker 1: Or the thing is, though, it would all depend on how well their security worked because people could pirate Pokemon and then try to trade from the pirated Pokemon.

673
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:20,310
Speaker 0: Well, secondary...

674
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,869
Speaker 1: Which a lot of people do.

675
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:22,972
Speaker 1: A lot of people.

676
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:36,790
Speaker 1: back in the day, I remember the original Pokemon, what people would do is they would get two copies, they would use a GameShark on one copy of Pokemon to get all sorts of Pokemons with the GameShark, and then trade them over to the legitimate un-GameSharked copies.

677
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,129
Speaker 1: So it's like, I just traded for these.

678
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:38,817
Speaker 0: Six missing?

679
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:39,649
Speaker 0: No, that can't lose.

680
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got six Mewtwos and they're all level 100 max stat.

681
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:46,990
Speaker 1: I made them with a GameShark and I traded them over.

682
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,130
Speaker 1: So I didn't GameShark this copy of Pokemon.

683
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:50,274
Speaker 1: I traded for these.

684
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:54,470
Speaker 1: Someone willingly traded me these six full-powered Mewtwos for six Pidgeys.

685
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:56,250
Speaker 1: One other prediction I have... They made the trades!

686
00:32:56,691 --> 00:33:00,350
Speaker 0: If this ever happened, I think there would be more theft of Pokemon cartridges.

687
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:03,410
Speaker 1: Oh man, and wouldn't it be more crushing?

688
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh my god, I imagine kids just crying.

689
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:12,830
Speaker 1: You buy three copies of Pokemon, you trade all three starters into one of the three cartridges, and then someone steals that cartridge.

690
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,310
Speaker 1: Now you've gotta buy three more.

691
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:17,369
Speaker 1: You can't buy just the one more, right?

692
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,850
Speaker 1: You gotta buy three more to get all those three starters back.

693
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,540
Speaker 0: To get all three kinds, Koreda.

694
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:22,103
Speaker 0: Koreda.

695
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:22,626
Speaker 0: Koreda.

696
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,230
Speaker 0: Three kinds.

697
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:23,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fucked up.

698
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,970
Speaker 0: So things of the day!

699
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:38,250
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, young, I watched Mask, I watched Transformers, I watched He-Man, I wish I hadn't.

700
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,050
Speaker 0: Didn't watch My Little Pony.

701
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:40,949
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

702
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,130
Speaker 1: You know, I know you loved that Mask, but actually Mask was never on where I lived.

703
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,109
Speaker 1: I never even knew about it until you loved it.

704
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,483
Speaker 0: I watched Mask every goddamn day.

705
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:49,570
Speaker 0: That was like the show.

706
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:53,710
Speaker 1: I don't think I've actually seen a full episode of Mask in my life.

707
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,670
Speaker 0: It doesn't hold up that well.

708
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,009
Speaker 1: No kidding, but I've seen plenty of commercials, I know what it is.

709
00:33:57,614 --> 00:33:58,610
Speaker 1: I've seen plenty of toys.

710
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,194
Speaker 0: Here's the deal.

711
00:33:59,457 --> 00:34:00,810
Speaker 0: Show not as good as Transformers.

712
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,870
Speaker 0: Toys, way better than Transformers.

713
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,910
Speaker 1: I know, Transformers are pretty good, depending on which one you get.

714
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,870
Speaker 0: I will stand so fucking hard behind this statement.

715
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,549
Speaker 0: Mask toys were some of the best.

716
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:26,790
Speaker 0: But I remember one day, I saw the middle of a show, and I didn't know what it was, I had my aunt's house, and it had a big dinosaur with an exposed ribcage and his guts, and he ripped himself open and picked up a girl and shoved her into his guts.

717
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:27,429
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

718
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,790
Speaker 0: And then closed the ribcage.

719
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,186
Speaker 1: That sounds like something that would be in modern, funny webcomics like Dr.

720
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:34,149
Speaker 1: McNinja or some shit.

721
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,958
Speaker 1: So then, I was a young goddamn kid.

722
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:45,467
Speaker 0: So later, I was in a toy store, and I remember seeing a toy of that, where you could open the ribcage and put the thing in.

723
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,150
Speaker 0: And I didn't remember anything else.

724
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:51,110
Speaker 0: And it kind of bothered me for most of my life.

725
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,050
Speaker 0: I had this lingering memory of, what the fuck was that?

726
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,110
Speaker 0: But I didn't really do a lot of effort.

727
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:59,550
Speaker 0: I googled around for dinosaur rib girl stuff.

728
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

729
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,148
Speaker 1: There's that one show that's all about the canyons, and there's ropes.

730
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:03,990
Speaker 1: There were toys.

731
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:05,630
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I had a friend who had all those toys.

732
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,390
Speaker 1: Right, and I had a couple of them, and I had a friend who had even more.

733
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,550
Speaker 1: And Wyatt remembered the name of the show, and then I found it online three times.

734
00:35:12,671 --> 00:35:14,550
Speaker 1: But every time I look it up online, I find it.

735
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,750
Speaker 1: And I'm like, aha, that was that show.

736
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,310
Speaker 0: What's it called?

737
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:16,830
Speaker 1: I forget.

738
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:19,830
Speaker 1: I keep looking it up, remembering it, and then forgetting it.

739
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,749
Speaker 1: But it's a show where basically the toys and the guys would have ropes.

740
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:26,490
Speaker 1: that would be in the Grand Canyon and other places.

741
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,570
Speaker 1: They're going to need more rope.

742
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,370
Speaker 1: And all the toys were vehicles that slid back and forth along the ropes.

743
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,570
Speaker 1: And the soldiers also slid back and forth along the ropes while shooting at each other.

744
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:37,530
Speaker 0: I made toys with string that did the same thing.

745
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:48,029
Speaker 0: Anyway, the show is called Inhumanoids, thanks to James Rolfe, the angry video game nerd/proprietor of Cinemassacre, who just reviewed it four days ago.

746
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,719
Speaker 0: The screenshot on the page, I clicked on it because I watch everything he does, and I saw the ribcage, and I'm like, what?

747
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:54,302
Speaker 0: What?

748
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:55,530
Speaker 0: No fucking way.

749
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,172
Speaker 0: And you know what?

750
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,550
Speaker 0: The show is way sicker and more hardcore than I thought it was.

751
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:05,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, this show, actually, based on this review, which is all I've ever heard of this show, I actually kind of want to see it, kind of.

752
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,790
Speaker 0: So, mystery of my childhood solved.

753
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:11,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's another mystery of my childhood that I haven't been able to find by searching on the internet.

754
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,159
Speaker 1: I had one toy from this.

755
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,749
Speaker 1: It was some sort of weird-- I never actually watched an episode of it, but I had one toy.

756
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,355
Speaker 1: It was some sort of thing.

757
00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:21,510
Speaker 1: It was sort of medieval-ish styling, but dark.

758
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:28,030
Speaker 1: And basically, the shtick was all the guys had shields with crazy holograms in their shields.

759
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,510
Speaker 1: And it was, you know, like-- Oh, that was Greystar.

760
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,075
Speaker 1: Is it?

761
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:32,401
Speaker 0: I just made that up.

762
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,150
Speaker 0: I had no idea.

763
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:33,997
Speaker 1: I was like, what?

764
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:35,189
Speaker 1: I don't think that's what it is.

765
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:37,309
Speaker 0: There's no such thing as Greystar.

766
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:39,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't sound-- I think it was Hollow something.

767
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,750
Speaker 1: But the whole shtick was the toys all had holograms on them.

768
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,624
Speaker 1: So it'd be like action figures, and they'd have like a hologram somewhere on them.

769
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:49,304
Speaker 1: that would be all, you know, like the single-colored style of hologram.

770
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:49,706
Speaker 1: that was all 3D-ish.

771
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:51,749
Speaker 1: You know, anyway.

772
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,069
Speaker 1: So, thing of the day.

773
00:36:54,450 --> 00:37:00,030
Speaker 1: So, you remember, we did a show a while back, I think we did, on Retro Video Game Master, the DS game.

774
00:37:00,191 --> 00:37:01,270
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's a really good game.

775
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:01,990
Speaker 1: It's a really good game.

776
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:10,370
Speaker 1: Apparently, I don't know if I knew this and forgot it, like I did with the name of the show with the ropes, or if I never knew it, but-- Candlejack?

777
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:11,145
Speaker 1: Candlejack.

778
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:20,270
Speaker 1: Apparently, this is actually-- that video game was based on a TV show, where, you know, Arino plays games and tries to beat them.

779
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:26,389
Speaker 1: So, they were trying to look-- actually, the people who made the show were actually trying to get it licensed internationally.

780
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:27,484
Speaker 1: Huh?

781
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:33,607
Speaker 1: And interestingly enough, Kotaku, in a very-- I think a very smart move, licensed the show for U.S.

782
00:37:33,687 --> 00:37:34,530
Speaker 1: internet distribution.

783
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,010
Speaker 1: Oh, shit, son.

784
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:42,830
Speaker 1: It kind of sucks because they're forced by, you know, their contract to use a video player that blocks people outside of North America.

785
00:37:43,271 --> 00:37:44,195
Speaker 1: So, if you're not in Canada,

786
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:44,536
Speaker 1: U.S.,

787
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:51,330
Speaker 1: or Mexico, you can't really watch it unless you get a proxy or something, just like we can't watch BBC iPlayer or listen to Spotify.

788
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,285
Speaker 0: Yep, because there's no way to get a proxy going.

789
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:53,890
Speaker 0: That's just impossible.

790
00:37:54,131 --> 00:37:54,630
Speaker 1: That's just impossible.

791
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:59,610
Speaker 1: But, yeah, or, you know, find someone who ripped the video to some other, you know, place that you can watch.

792
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,270
Speaker 0: Oh, God, it's always all on BitTorrent.

793
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:09,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, so they, you know, translated and put subtitles on an episode of this show, and they're going to do an episode every week, so the next episode should be actually Thursday.

794
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:11,890
Speaker 1: Every Thursday, they're going to do an episode.

795
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:18,710
Speaker 1: They're not doing them in order, and it doesn't look like they're doing every episode, but it looks like they're picking the episodes based on how awesome they think they are.

796
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,729
Speaker 1: So, the first episode they picked was Ninja Gaiden.

797
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,629
Speaker 0: Oh, Ninja Gaiden.

798
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, it's Ninja Gaiden.

799
00:38:25,495 --> 00:38:43,550
Speaker 1: Anyway, and, yeah, the game is balls hard, but I've watched the full episode, and I actually really like this show, so I recommend you watch it every Thursday on Kotaku, despite them being determined to stick with their really horrible format of their blog.

800
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,151
Speaker 1: Yep.

801
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,946
Speaker 0: So, in the meta moment, the Book Club book is still...

802
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:49,630
Speaker 1: Foundation.

803
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,206
Speaker 1: By?

804
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:50,866
Speaker 1: Asimov.

805
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,324
Speaker 1: Yes.

806
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:53,510
Speaker 1: We're going to do an episode on it on Thursday, right?

807
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:54,687
Speaker 0: I didn't finish reading it.

808
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:57,105
Speaker 1: Uh, can you finish it by Thursday?

809
00:38:57,186 --> 00:38:57,630
Speaker 1: It's short.

810
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta go find it.

811
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:00,589
Speaker 1: How far did you get?

812
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:03,470
Speaker 0: I read a few pages, and then I was reading other stuff.

813
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:08,070
Speaker 1: Well, maybe this Thursday, if not this Thursday, the following Thursday episode.

814
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,999
Speaker 0: It's later on somewhere.

815
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,949
Speaker 0: I'll find it and read it.

816
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:11,809
Speaker 0: I've been busy.

817
00:39:12,114 --> 00:39:12,310
Speaker 1: Yeah.

818
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,330
Speaker 0: Playing Team Fortress.

819
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,690
Speaker 1: I didn't finish it yet, either, but it's so short that I'm going to definitely finish it by Thursday.

820
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,623
Speaker 0: Yep, and we're just doing the first one.

821
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:20,550
Speaker 0: We're not doing the whole...

822
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's actually a trilogy.

823
00:39:21,936 --> 00:39:25,030
Speaker 1: A lot of times you can buy it as all three in one volume.

824
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,990
Speaker 1: Actually, there's more than three, but it's really the three are the foundation.

825
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,262
Speaker 1: Yep.

826
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,330
Speaker 1: But we're only going to do the first book, because I like, you know, I'm still trying to keep it easy.

827
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,790
Speaker 0: The unofficial Book Club book is still all of the Prince of Nothing books by our Scott Bakker.

828
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,969
Speaker 0: You should get in on this, because we're...

829
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,030
Speaker 1: Once I finish Foundation, I'm going to go back to rereading them.

830
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,230
Speaker 0: Yep, and we're going to do a show on all the Prince of Nothing stuff, because people are talking about it again.

831
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,250
Speaker 0: And you can tell, because you'll know it's like a club.

832
00:39:47,571 --> 00:39:53,350
Speaker 0: The people who have read those books make a surprising number of inside jokes that you will not be getting until you read them.

833
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like there's a lot of popular fantasy series out there, you know.

834
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,630
Speaker 0: But how many Bilbo Baggins jokes can you make?

835
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,710
Speaker 1: I mean, there's Lord of the Rings, there's Games of Thrones, there's, uh, what's the Wheel of Times.

836
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, I remember.

837
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:11,390
Speaker 1: Those things are all pretty popular, right, and I haven't read most of them, so I mean, I've read Lord of the Rings, obviously.

838
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:15,488
Speaker 1: But I haven't read Wheel of Times or Games of Thrones, so I don't know how good or bad they are.

839
00:40:17,036 --> 00:40:18,069
Speaker 1: I think it's Locke Lamora.

840
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,750
Speaker 0: There aren't inside jokes to the degree that there are in The Prince of Nothing.

841
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,770
Speaker 1: Oh, there are inside jokes in Locke Lamora.

842
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,995
Speaker 0: But they're more complex.

843
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:28,987
Speaker 0: There aren't as many like, "A man's got to

844
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:29,468
Speaker 0: remember.".

845
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:35,722
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah, read Prince of Nothing.

846
00:40:35,782 --> 00:40:38,710
Speaker 1: It's the official fantasy series of Geek Nights.

847
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:44,249
Speaker 0: Connecticut is in Hartford, Connecticut, not this weekend, but next weekend.

848
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,050
Speaker 1: The weekend after the 4th of July weekend.

849
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,819
Speaker 0: June 8th, 9th, and 10th.

850
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,530
Speaker 0: We are doing very few panels.

851
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,110
Speaker 1: But we're in charge of panels.

852
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,570
Speaker 0: Yes, we're running the panels department.

853
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,170
Speaker 1: And also, if we get some free time, we're going to be playing some games.

854
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,530
Speaker 0: We got some motherfucking panelists this year.

855
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:02,630
Speaker 0: We had more submissions to this Kineticon than Kineticon has ever seen.

856
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,670
Speaker 1: Which means we rejected a lot of the crap because we had more goods.

857
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,790
Speaker 0: Actually, we had a lot of good I had to reject.

858
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:08,649
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

859
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel really bad for some things I had to turn down.

860
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,289
Speaker 1: People really liked our selection last year.

861
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:16,670
Speaker 1: If I can manage to get this pocket guide printed, then we'll be in serious business.

862
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're up in the ante.

863
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,830
Speaker 0: I mean, every year Kineticon's getting better.

864
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:30,890
Speaker 0: But it's come a long way from the year where we showed up, got our badges after tricking someone into giving them to us, found a program guide, looked through, circled all the panels that sounded like ones that Mike thought we were going to do.

865
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,330
Speaker 1: Actually, but the thing is, the first year we went was way awesome when they gave us itineraries.

866
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,470
Speaker 0: Yup, I have sent itineraries to most of our panelists.

867
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:37,946
Speaker 1: Nice.

868
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:38,453
Speaker 0: Yeah.

869
00:41:39,217 --> 00:41:41,370
Speaker 0: Anyway, PAX Prime is coming up.

870
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:48,250
Speaker 0: We are doing one panel, I can say now, on Saturday at noon, probably in the bigger panel room.

871
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:54,850
Speaker 0: I think I am safe to say that it is our brand new panel that we've got some exciting technology to use.

872
00:41:56,131 --> 00:42:05,450
Speaker 0: And we may or may not be doing panel-like things that are not our normal panels in the rest of our time, instead of doing the panels we did at PAX East.

873
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we've done so many PAXes, right?

874
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:14,350
Speaker 1: It's like, I feel that I can do something at one at a PAX and not feel bad about wasting a PAX day.

875
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,070
Speaker 1: Because I won't be wasting it, first of all.

876
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:23,110
Speaker 1: But doing something special and missing some PAX things is like, I'm going to be going to 50+ PAXes in my life, hopefully, if I live, right?

877
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,220
Speaker 1: So, I think I'm going to make a day of RPG.

878
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,870
Speaker 1: I guess if our panel's Saturday, I might make it Friday.

879
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:36,570
Speaker 0: Well, well, if you're doing a day of RPG, there might be something we might be doing related to that in an official manner.

880
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:40,990
Speaker 1: Basically, a day of RPG is just one of the possible ideas I have, right?

881
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:49,170
Speaker 1: Obviously, if it's going to be a Friday, it's after keynote, play an RPG, play another RPG, play another RPG until they kick you out.

882
00:42:49,812 --> 00:42:52,370
Speaker 1: You probably get three or four sessions in of one-shots.

883
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,880
Speaker 0: We also may or may not be at PAX Dev.

884
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:56,890
Speaker 0: I cannot say anything on that front yet.

885
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,730
Speaker 0: And that's all the matter.

886
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:04,567
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hope they got to tell us about that PAX Dev so we can buy the right plane tickets and hotels and stuff.

887
00:43:04,587 --> 00:43:05,330
Speaker 1: Hurry up with that, guys.

888
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure they'll get there.

889
00:43:06,776 --> 00:43:09,610
Speaker 0: The schedule's about half online currently.

890
00:43:10,931 --> 00:43:12,310
Speaker 0: So, Small World.

891
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:13,130
Speaker 1: Small World.

892
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:13,947
Speaker 1: Small World.

893
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,668
Speaker 1: I think before we talk about Small World... Felipe K Arts.

894
00:43:17,434 --> 00:43:18,329
Speaker 1: It's a small world.

895
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,750
Speaker 0: Don't even, don't even.

896
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,270
Speaker 1: We gotta talk about Vinci.

897
00:43:21,571 --> 00:43:24,350
Speaker 0: So, Small World is made by... Why do you think we gotta talk about Vinci first?

898
00:43:24,691 --> 00:43:26,399
Speaker 0: By Felipe K Arts.

899
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,303
Speaker 0: K-A Arts.

900
00:43:27,463 --> 00:43:28,428
Speaker 0: K Arts.

901
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:31,770
Speaker 1: And Vinci is made by Felipe K Arts.

902
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:38,010
Speaker 0: As is another game called Evo, which is a fun little game that I played once at RIT with Professor Richman.

903
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,908
Speaker 1: I'm trying to remember if I played that.

904
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,729
Speaker 0: The little evolution game.

905
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:42,569
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

906
00:43:43,072 --> 00:43:44,450
Speaker 1: I remember Evo for the SNES.

907
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,810
Speaker 0: Oh my god, that game was awesome and terrible.

908
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:52,950
Speaker 1: But anyway, so we were at a gaming store one day and there was this game Vinci on the discount table, right?

909
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:55,409
Speaker 1: And Alex was, and then he bought it.

910
00:43:55,831 --> 00:43:58,270
Speaker 1: And basically all he had heard about the game was that it was A, out of print.

911
00:43:58,951 --> 00:44:00,730
Speaker 1: And B, that there were some flaws in it.

912
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:04,890
Speaker 1: Like, I knew they had typos and some other, like, flaws in the instructions.

913
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,629
Speaker 1: So we got Vinci at the discount bin.

914
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:11,310
Speaker 1: And we played it and it was actually a fantastic game, right?

915
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,650
Speaker 1: And basically the idea of Vinci is it's sort of risk-like.

916
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,710
Speaker 1: Where you have units and you conquer space territories on a map.

917
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,649
Speaker 0: Well, we did a whole show on it.

918
00:44:19,854 --> 00:44:20,289
Speaker 1: Oh, did we?

919
00:44:20,472 --> 00:44:21,634
Speaker 0: In 2007.

920
00:44:21,634 --> 00:44:22,783
Speaker 1: Oh, so go back and listen to our 2007 Vinci show.

921
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:29,870
Speaker 0: So basically Small World is the same game remade with a skin.

922
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,569
Speaker 1: Right, so basically Vinci had those flaws with it.

923
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,489
Speaker 1: So the same guy, years later, as in a couple years ago, maybe a year or two ago.

924
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:40,949
Speaker 1: He remade the game, changed a bunch of the rules to polish it up.

925
00:44:41,872 --> 00:44:44,090
Speaker 1: He changed the theme to make it fantasy-like.

926
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:45,626
Speaker 0: As opposed to abstract.

927
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,449
Speaker 1: Generic Europe, medieval crap, right?

928
00:44:48,711 --> 00:44:50,529
Speaker 1: So that it would sell on game shelves.

929
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:52,530
Speaker 1: He fixed the typos.

930
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,850
Speaker 1: He basically redid the game while keeping most of the rules.

931
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,210
Speaker 1: So it's 90% the same game.

932
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:57,230
Speaker 0: Put out by Days of Wonder.

933
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,350
Speaker 0: So instead of being in the right shelves next to all the other Days of Wonder games.

934
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,838
Speaker 1: You might as well call it Vinci 2.0, right?

935
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:06,168
Speaker 1: And he put out this game Small World and we bought it.

936
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,690
Speaker 1: And we finally got around to playing it, despite it being crazy popular.

937
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:10,360
Speaker 0: And you know what?

938
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:10,909
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

939
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:13,850
Speaker 0: If you were on the hedge, you might as well just buy it.

940
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:14,470
Speaker 0: It's a solid game.

941
00:45:14,831 --> 00:45:16,409
Speaker 1: It's not like you're going to buy a copy of Vinci.

942
00:45:17,352 --> 00:45:18,910
Speaker 1: You might as well buy a copy of Small World.

943
00:45:19,192 --> 00:45:21,230
Speaker 0: Now, one thing I have to say, this is kind of an aside.

944
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:27,010
Speaker 0: But I've never had this experience until now of having played a game and knew the rules very well.

945
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:32,850
Speaker 0: And then having played a game that is based on that game so much that it's almost the same game.

946
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,450
Speaker 0: It is way harder to learn the rules of the second game that's almost the same.

947
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:41,630
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's because you don't put in the full effort of reading the rules straightforwardly, right?

948
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:46,830
Speaker 1: Because what you do is you look for the rules differences and you skip over the rest.

949
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,029
Speaker 1: But the other problem with that is you get to a section of the rule book and you say, "Oh, I know this

950
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:51,270
Speaker 1: rule."

951
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:52,409
Speaker 1: And you skip over it.

952
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,221
Speaker 1: But really, there might have been something different in there.

953
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:55,550
Speaker 1: you missed because you skipped over it.

954
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:00,290
Speaker 0: Also, Days of Wonder games have kind of crap instructions usually, which makes it kind of hard to parse anyway.

955
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,109
Speaker 1: It's kind of hard.

956
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,770
Speaker 1: It's like once you know a rule, it's hard.

957
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:10,770
Speaker 1: It's like it's easier to search a rule book with your eyes if you don't know the rules at all than it is to search them being very familiar with them.

958
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, well this is an aside.

959
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,530
Speaker 0: This is definitely in the shit talking stage.

960
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:21,610
Speaker 0: But after PAX and after things calmed down, I started on this privately because I realized that 90% of the rules I've ever read for any board game pissed me off.

961
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:25,370
Speaker 0: And I know exactly what to fix because I've written so much tech documentation in my life.

962
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:29,330
Speaker 0: I want to write a stupid RFC and here's how to write the rules for a board game.

963
00:46:30,472 --> 00:46:33,890
Speaker 1: The thing is that information is already out there, but people don't.

964
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,690
Speaker 0: It's not in a format that people who write board game rules would ever find.

965
00:46:37,414 --> 00:46:38,310
Speaker 0: It's also not obvious.

966
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:41,270
Speaker 0: It is not like do this, then this in this exact format.

967
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,367
Speaker 0: You pig fuckers.

968
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:44,850
Speaker 0: That's just, I'm going for it.

969
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:50,690
Speaker 0: But anyway, so we ran into weird problems like we're playing and then halfway through the game we're like wait a minute, do you have to be contiguous?

970
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,070
Speaker 0: Because in Vinci, you had to be contiguous.

971
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, you couldn't in Vinci.

972
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,130
Speaker 0: And you got bisected.

973
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:58,670
Speaker 1: You weren't allowed to have say a territory on the left and a territory on the right.

974
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,256
Speaker 1: All your territories had to be touching each other.

975
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:03,470
Speaker 1: unless you had, what was it, astronomy or something like that?

976
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:05,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one that lets you be discontinuous.

977
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:08,570
Speaker 1: There was basically a special power that let you be discontinuous.

978
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,450
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you couldn't.

979
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,110
Speaker 1: You had to keep all your stuff connected.

980
00:47:12,611 --> 00:47:18,890
Speaker 1: But in Small World, we couldn't find a rule in the rule book, correct us if we're wrong, that says you had to be connected.

981
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,469
Speaker 1: You could actually let your guys split up.

982
00:47:20,691 --> 00:47:22,010
Speaker 1: You could take all, you know, it didn't matter.

983
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:23,190
Speaker 0: Yep, we might be wrong.

984
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,269
Speaker 0: We only played the game twice.

985
00:47:24,951 --> 00:47:26,250
Speaker 1: And I read the, I checked the rules.

986
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:31,650
Speaker 1: I couldn't find anything about being forced to be contiguous, which significantly changes the game.

987
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:32,809
Speaker 0: So huge differences.

988
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:39,430
Speaker 1: Because you can basically conquer a territory temporarily for a turn and then abandon it to get more valuable territories on the other side.

989
00:47:39,831 --> 00:47:45,590
Speaker 0: So the gist of the game, in case you've never played Vinci, is that there's a list of a set of races and a set of powers.

990
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,930
Speaker 0: And they are randomly combined into a list.

991
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:54,068
Speaker 0: Like, I don't know, dragon rider elves or spectral giants.

992
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:55,670
Speaker 1: Stout gnomes.

993
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,730
Speaker 0: Actually, I had spectral ratmen, which was both hilarious and overpowered.

994
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:05,110
Speaker 1: Yes, the ones that we noticed that were overpowered were spirit is definitely overpowered.

995
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:07,898
Speaker 0: I don't think they're overpowered.

996
00:48:07,939 --> 00:48:10,310
Speaker 0: I think the people we played with did not optimally fuck.

997
00:48:12,171 --> 00:48:15,690
Speaker 0: So you pick a race and there's like a loadout, a draft.

998
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,490
Speaker 0: So if you want to pick one, it's free if it's at the top of the list.

999
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:23,730
Speaker 0: You have to pay victory points to skip over them to get one further down the list.

1000
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:28,750
Speaker 0: And you leave those victory points on the ones you didn't take, which is a very elegant way of balancing the game.

1001
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, so initially at the beginning of the game there is sort of a random factor, right?

1002
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:38,350
Speaker 1: If you go first and an awesome combination is in the first slot, you can get it for free without having to pay victory points.

1003
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:41,850
Speaker 0: Ah, but going first appears to be a disadvantage in the long run.

1004
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:48,350
Speaker 1: Right, it does because by going onto the board first, everyone can just come in on top of you and there's not much you can do about it.

1005
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,750
Speaker 1: Unless you're like the super strong defensive hobbits or something like that.

1006
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,850
Speaker 0: So you come onto the board, the game is deterministic with one twist.

1007
00:48:55,030 --> 00:49:01,510
Speaker 0: In that to conquer a territory, you pick up all your guys from the board, except the ones that are holding onto territories every round.

1008
00:49:01,954 --> 00:49:03,449
Speaker 0: And then you throw them all back on the board.

1009
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:08,390
Speaker 0: And instead of risk where it's like, alright I roll the dice to see if my ten guys beat your four guys or whatever.

1010
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:17,310
Speaker 0: It costs two guys to take a territory, plus one for every enemy guy on it, plus any other modifiers that may be in place.

1011
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,290
Speaker 0: Like forest plus one, mountain plus one.

1012
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,390
Speaker 1: So it's completely deterministic, all the combat.

1013
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,730
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it requires this many units to conquer these territories, but everyone has a limited number of units.

1014
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:31,070
Speaker 1: So you can only expand your empire so far and you can't do it all in one turn.

1015
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,589
Speaker 1: You have to do it over the course of many turns.

1016
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,050
Speaker 0: Also the more you expand, the less you can expand in the future.

1017
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,370
Speaker 0: And the more difficult it is to defend because you have more places to defend with a limited number of units.

1018
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,190
Speaker 0: Also every race gets a different number of units.

1019
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:45,070
Speaker 1: So what you do is when you've sort of reached the limit of your expansion.

1020
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:47,150
Speaker 1: What you do is you decline.

1021
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:48,210
Speaker 0: Diocletian!

1022
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,750
Speaker 1: That empire now becomes a declining empire.

1023
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,890
Speaker 1: You basically stop playing it, but it stays on the board.

1024
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,850
Speaker 1: And you go and you get a new empire.

1025
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,089
Speaker 0: And you keep getting points from it.

1026
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,990
Speaker 1: Right, but you get points from the old empire.

1027
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:01,090
Speaker 1: So what you want to do is you want to have a big old empire that still exists.

1028
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,550
Speaker 1: And a big current empire that still exists.

1029
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,095
Speaker 1: And you want them both simultaneously.

1030
00:50:06,155 --> 00:50:09,206
Speaker 1: so we can get double points from having two simultaneous empires.

1031
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,069
Speaker 1: An old one and a new one.

1032
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:18,690
Speaker 1: And as the old one gets disintegrated, then you decline the new one and you come onto the board with another one.

1033
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:23,570
Speaker 1: So you always have two going and you cycle them and then you get the most points and win.

1034
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:29,410
Speaker 0: Now this mechanic is awesome because it works a lot like a Formula 1 race with the pitting.

1035
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,630
Speaker 0: You basically have to pick.

1036
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:34,269
Speaker 0: And when you decline, you do it at the start of your turn.

1037
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,748
Speaker 0: But you get victory points from your turn at the end of your turn.

1038
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,550
Speaker 0: So on a normal turn, you do all your conquest, get all your victory points.

1039
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,150
Speaker 0: You probably have a whole bunch of bonus powers from your race.

1040
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:48,150
Speaker 0: If you decline, you do fuck all.

1041
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,269
Speaker 1: You don't do anything.

1042
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,630
Speaker 0: You just flip over all your guys, all your powers go away.

1043
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:52,369
Speaker 1: You get some points.

1044
00:50:52,471 --> 00:50:53,309
Speaker 0: You get some points.

1045
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,010
Speaker 1: Not a lot.

1046
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:57,050
Speaker 0: And then you don't come back onto the board until the next round.

1047
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:00,530
Speaker 0: It feels really rough to decline.

1048
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,444
Speaker 1: Unless you have Stout.

1049
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:08,050
Speaker 1: If you're Stout, which is the same thing as Rebirth and Vinci, you can decline at the end of your turn.

1050
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:11,870
Speaker 1: Which means you can take a turn and then decline and then without wasting a turn.

1051
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:13,670
Speaker 1: Which is incredibly powerful.

1052
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,070
Speaker 0: Now when you decline, it's like being punched in the face.

1053
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,229
Speaker 0: It's like playing Age of Steam.

1054
00:51:17,651 --> 00:51:23,010
Speaker 0: But remember when you're playing this game, everybody has to decline at some point.

1055
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, and when you come back onto the board, it's like super awesome, tally ho.

1056
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:31,830
Speaker 1: Here I come with a brand new set of guys and I can just kick someone right in the ass because they left the edge of the board undefended.

1057
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:32,342
Speaker 1: Ca-blah.

1058
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:32,945
Speaker 1: Yep.

1059
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,510
Speaker 0: So the game pretty much is that.

1060
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,770
Speaker 0: And it goes a set number of turns and then the game is over.

1061
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,030
Speaker 0: Unlike Vinci, which went to a set number of victory points.

1062
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's much more interesting, right?

1063
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,770
Speaker 1: Meaning Vinci, it was a set number of victory points.

1064
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:49,750
Speaker 1: You couldn't really, you had to work really hard to schedule your declines, right?

1065
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:53,990
Speaker 1: Because scheduling on the, declining on the final turn of the game can only hurt you, right?

1066
00:51:54,591 --> 00:51:57,609
Speaker 1: So it's all about when is the game going to end, how many turns are left.

1067
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,490
Speaker 1: In Small World, you know exactly how many turns are left.

1068
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:06,150
Speaker 0: That's a huge dynamic changer, coupled with the fact that Vinci had open scoring.

1069
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,289
Speaker 0: It had, you know, the 90s style score track around the board.

1070
00:52:10,771 --> 00:52:14,910
Speaker 0: Small World has victory point tokens that are supposed to be kept secret.

1071
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:18,750
Speaker 0: Now you can keep count, it's basically just a who can actually keep count thing.

1072
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:23,989
Speaker 0: But I think what they were trying to remove from the game is the fact that the end of Vinci always came down to.

1073
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:29,990
Speaker 0: Pete is winning, I'm going to fuck Pete in the ass to prevent him from going over the edge.

1074
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, because not everyone has counted the victory points.

1075
00:52:33,271 --> 00:52:34,750
Speaker 0: I count them, I know exactly who to fuck.

1076
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,089
Speaker 1: I absolutely counted them, but not everyone has counted them.

1077
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:41,470
Speaker 1: Therefore, it's difficult to convince everyone to say gang up on the leader.

1078
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:49,510
Speaker 1: And also, gang up on the leader isn't necessarily going to help you win, because you're not going to say delay the end of the game, because the end of the game is coming no matter what.

1079
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:54,970
Speaker 1: So if they've already got more points, the only thing you can do with a limited number of turns is maximize your points.

1080
00:52:55,470 --> 00:53:02,330
Speaker 1: In Vinci, you could actually slow the game down, attacking the leader would actually, you know, give you another turn possibly.

1081
00:53:03,031 --> 00:53:09,950
Speaker 1: Whereas in Small World, attacking the leader, unless that's the optimal way for you to get points, isn't going to help you as much.

1082
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:19,550
Speaker 0: This also removes some of the tension from the end of the game, because if you don't know exactly when the game is going to end, you might have to really make a tough decision as to whether or not to decline.

1083
00:53:20,052 --> 00:53:22,090
Speaker 0: The game might end, you might get fucked, you don't know.

1084
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,950
Speaker 0: In this game, if you decline in the last round, you're an idiot.

1085
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,541
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, I just looked and I won the second game.

1086
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:30,830
Speaker 1: we played demonstratively, right?

1087
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:36,350
Speaker 1: And what I did is, you know, I had spirit guys who stayed around the whole game getting me points, that helped a lot.

1088
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:42,210
Speaker 1: But the other thing I did was I basically looked and I said, you know, with this many players, this is going to be ten turns.

1089
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,370
Speaker 1: I think it was ten turns, right?

1090
00:53:43,811 --> 00:53:47,010
Speaker 1: I said, I will decline on these turns, and I did exactly that.

1091
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:51,210
Speaker 1: I kept to that schedule, and I declined exactly three times, I think.

1092
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:59,710
Speaker 0: And because the game is clockwise, it is the exact same endgame dynamic that happens in El Grande with the big and the low bidding.

1093
00:53:59,981 --> 00:54:00,169
Speaker 1: Yep.

1094
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,669
Speaker 0: The exact same thing.

1095
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:18,170
Speaker 1: So, you know, if I play, you know, with any number of players, it doesn't matter, I'm going to look at how many turns there are, I'm going to figure out the optimal declining schedule, and I'm going to try to pick my combinations based on, of course, how many points they'll get me, but also, will they stick to my declining schedule, right?

1096
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:22,350
Speaker 1: If I'm behind, I've got to pick a race that will be able to decline more quickly.

1097
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:27,310
Speaker 1: Or if I'm ahead, then I've got to pick a slow race that needs like three turns to expand.

1098
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:29,429
Speaker 1: I'll be like, how many turns will it take for that race to decline?

1099
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,750
Speaker 1: That's how I'm going to judge them when I pick them, right?

1100
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:34,810
Speaker 1: That's a two-turn race, that's a three-turn, you know, that's a four-turn.

1101
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:40,450
Speaker 1: And then I could pick so that I declined at exactly the right times to get the maximum points out of every single turn.

1102
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,988
Speaker 0: So, the races and the powers, in Vinci, they were very abstract.

1103
00:54:45,471 --> 00:54:47,670
Speaker 1: In Vinci, there weren't separate races and powers.

1104
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,030
Speaker 1: It was just chits, and they could be combined any which way.

1105
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,690
Speaker 0: Yep, you could have double and something.

1106
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,530
Speaker 1: You could have double barbarian.

1107
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:55,610
Speaker 0: Oh my god, that's a lot of barbarians.

1108
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,870
Speaker 1: You could have diplomacy, currency.

1109
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:00,890
Speaker 1: You could have, you know, astronomy and mining.

1110
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,230
Speaker 1: You could have all sorts of combinations.

1111
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,570
Speaker 0: But the powers were also very abstract and usually came down to numbers games.

1112
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:11,730
Speaker 0: In Small World, the powers are all way out there, Dune-style crazy bullshit.

1113
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,690
Speaker 0: Like, some guys get dragon that they can just put somewhere and it's fucking invincible.

1114
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:20,570
Speaker 1: But at the same time, there's a lot less diversity in terms of the number of units you get.

1115
00:55:21,271 --> 00:55:25,550
Speaker 1: So, in Vinci, you could have one civilization, you could have like five units.

1116
00:55:25,811 --> 00:55:26,850
Speaker 1: And one guy's got like fourteen.

1117
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:31,710
Speaker 1: In this, all of the special powers have either three, four, or five.

1118
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:32,778
Speaker 1: Most of them have four.

1119
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:33,909
Speaker 1: Only one of them has three.

1120
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:38,470
Speaker 1: And all the races, the diversity and the number of units they get is very small.

1121
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:41,010
Speaker 0: The game gives you the exact minimum number of pieces.

1122
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, so almost everyone has like nine, ten, eleven-ish guys.

1123
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,217
Speaker 1: Almost everyone.

1124
00:55:46,257 --> 00:55:47,550
Speaker 1: I think you could have as many.

1125
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:50,630
Speaker 1: I think there's a combination that lets you have like thirteen, maybe?

1126
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:55,426
Speaker 1: And there is a combination that lets you have like five, which is the dwarf something.

1127
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:57,609
Speaker 0: The equivalent of currency.

1128
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I picked that combination and I got hosed.

1129
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:11,950
Speaker 0: So, this factor of the fact that the numbers are pretty much all in line and the powers are all equally crazy means that the game is almost too well-balanced.

1130
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:20,750
Speaker 0: Like, no matter what civilization you pick, unless you pick those fucking dwarves with the currency, you're coming onto the board roughly as strong as everyone else.

1131
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:31,790
Speaker 0: It's very balanced and very deterministic and very, I don't know, I dislike it a little bit compared to Vinci because of that.

1132
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:39,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Vinci, for example, if you picked mining, you would go for the pickaxes on the board and they would be worth two points and that was crazy awesome.

1133
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:44,187
Speaker 1: And you would, right, so everyone would be like, "Oh shit, don't let him take the, ah crap, he's got mining mountaineering,

1134
00:56:44,247 --> 00:56:44,770
Speaker 1: fuck.".

1135
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:53,270
Speaker 0: But in Small World, you can pretty much, with any civilization, you have like four different ways to come onto the board that are equally viable and it mostly doesn't matter who you attack.

1136
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:58,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, there's nothing that gives you that many points that is so much greater than everything else.

1137
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:03,910
Speaker 1: So it's like, okay, these guys get points on green and these guys get points on wizard marks and these guys get points on this.

1138
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,750
Speaker 1: Everyone's gonna get bonus points from something.

1139
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:14,390
Speaker 0: It's a better, tighter game in some ways, which at the same time reduces certain kinds of strategies from the previous game.

1140
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:20,970
Speaker 1: It's like, on the one hand, we should be happier, there's less randomness, but on the other hand, it's like, well, it's so, you know...

1141
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:22,830
Speaker 0: Ah, but they added randomness with the die.

1142
00:57:23,496 --> 00:57:24,329
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot about that.

1143
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:26,930
Speaker 0: In Vinci, you throw out all your guys and you have extra guys, that's it.

1144
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:33,090
Speaker 0: In this, if you've got one guy left, at least, you can roll this die, you have a chance of conquering one more thing.

1145
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:44,490
Speaker 0: Which is great in that it unsticks the game, but it's also a little bad in that it's random, but I feel like if that weren't in the game, I would've just given up on this game.

1146
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:50,310
Speaker 0: Because it's so well-balanced that without that little bit of randomness, it would've immediately solidified.

1147
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird that they bet, right?

1148
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,199
Speaker 1: And the thing is, they're putting victory points on the races.

1149
00:57:56,259 --> 00:58:04,450
Speaker 1: to skip over them, is suppo- or, I guess, civilizations, is supposed to be the factor that makes up for the fact that they're so unbalanced.

1150
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:07,810
Speaker 0: Well, 'cause it costs way more to skip them in Vinci, too.

1151
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:11,969
Speaker 0: It only costs one victory point, and you get a fuck-ton of victory points in Small World.

1152
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:20,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like, in Vinci, it's like, okay, one sieve might be way more powerful than another one, but you gotta pay a lot to skip over to the good ones.

1153
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:26,830
Speaker 1: So it's okay that they're unbalanced, because some guy who gets stuck with a crappy sieve is gonna get a ton of victory points.

1154
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:32,250
Speaker 0: Getting victory points from taking a Small World sieve that wasn't great for the map never really seems to matter.

1155
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,174
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't help you at all.

1156
00:58:33,194 --> 00:58:36,890
Speaker 1: You might as well pay the four victory points to get something more awesome, right?

1157
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:41,290
Speaker 0: But, you know, while I have these complaints, the game is still great.

1158
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:42,439
Speaker 0: Like, they're balanced out.

1159
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,530
Speaker 0: By one, the theme is great.

1160
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:47,970
Speaker 0: Like, the icons on the characters and their little, like, logos are pretty great.

1161
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:51,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, the art of this game, I mean, the Vinci art was pathetic.

1162
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:52,955
Speaker 0: Utilitarian.

1163
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:53,619
Speaker 0: I liked it.

1164
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:55,569
Speaker 0: It looked a lot like the game with the rondel.

1165
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:57,590
Speaker 1: Oh, what's that called?

1166
00:58:57,874 --> 00:58:58,128
Speaker 1: Antique.

1167
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,316
Speaker 1: Antique.

1168
00:58:59,598 --> 00:59:01,390
Speaker 1: But there's actually a rondel series, you know.

1169
00:59:01,591 --> 00:59:02,515
Speaker 1: I know, I know.

1170
00:59:02,716 --> 00:59:05,390
Speaker 0: I always kinda wanna buy it, then I remember that Antique wasn't that great.

1171
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:07,819
Speaker 1: Goa is great, though.

1172
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,189
Speaker 1: But it's not a rondel game either.

1173
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:16,130
Speaker 0: But, and also, the game, it tokenized a lot of the stuff that you just had to know in the old game.

1174
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,370
Speaker 0: Like, pretty much every power has tokens to represent it.

1175
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:23,110
Speaker 0: There are so many unique pieces to make sure that you know the count.

1176
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,133
Speaker 0: Everything is uniform.

1177
00:59:24,173 --> 00:59:29,070
Speaker 0: It's kind of like, if Vinci were second edition D&D, then this is third edition.

1178
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:29,153
Speaker 1: Yep.

1179
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:35,110
Speaker 0: Everything's tokenized, everything's literal, everything's worth one, everything's very simplified.

1180
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:39,030
Speaker 0: It makes the game very accessible, and it's still a great game.

1181
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:44,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, to make a game that is actually, you know, Vinci, kind of a, you know, somewhat hardcore game.

1182
00:59:45,692 --> 00:59:49,389
Speaker 1: To make it as accessible as Small World has made it is quite a design accomplishment.

1183
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:51,142
Speaker 0: I consider it equal to Vinci.

1184
00:59:51,182 --> 00:59:52,230
Speaker 0: They're equal but different.

1185
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:57,690
Speaker 0: If you like one, you will probably like the other, but you will like them for different reasons.

1186
00:59:57,971 --> 01:00:02,570
Speaker 1: And they're so similar, you know, despite being different, that only hardcore people care about these differences.

1187
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,929
Speaker 1: And the vast majority of people just love either game.

1188
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:05,350
Speaker 1: Yep.

1189
01:00:06,112 --> 01:00:09,470
Speaker 1: But the vast majority of people like Small World better because it's more well produced.

1190
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,830
Speaker 1: And, you know, streamlined and easier rules and better arts and all that stuff.

1191
01:00:13,991 --> 01:00:14,520
Speaker 1: It's a great game.

1192
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:15,110
Speaker 1: You should buy it.

1193
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:17,530
Speaker 1: So, just fucking play Small World if you haven't is the reason it's popular.

1194
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,570
Speaker 0: There are a million expansions.

1195
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:20,676
Speaker 1: A million expansions.

1196
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:22,310
Speaker 1: I haven't played any of them.

1197
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:27,910
Speaker 1: But my suspicion is that some of them are probably good and some of them are probably Carcassonne Catapult.

1198
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,470
Speaker 0: I was gonna say, the catapult.

1199
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:33,040
Speaker 1: I have no idea which ones are good, which ones are bad.

1200
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,990
Speaker 1: If any, I will have to do this research at a later date.

1201
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:36,391
Speaker 0: Yep.

1202
01:00:36,978 --> 01:00:38,050
Speaker 0: So, buy the game.

1203
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:42,190
Speaker 0: If you're a board gamer, it's a game that just, it deserves a place in your library.

1204
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:43,070
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.

1205
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,510
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1206
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:56,630
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1207
01:00:56,991 --> 01:01:02,030

1208
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,930
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1209
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:09,710
Speaker 0: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1212
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:20,650
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
