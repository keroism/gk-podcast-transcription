1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,678
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday April 25th.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,681
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:15,370
Speaker 1: I'm Rin and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:20,410
Speaker 1: Tonight we give you our first impressions of four new anime.

5
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:23,907
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:34,329
Speaker 0: So for the past week, I've been taking the train to work as I've been saying a lot And I saw you take the car at least once.

7
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:42,878
Speaker 0: I took the car home once on Monday because I ended up working late in the Bronx where I couldn't take a train home from aha.

8
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:51,655
Speaker 0: But for every other trip, I've been taking the train and it's really great except today I go and I'm on my way home and I get to the train station sure enough.

9
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:52,799
Speaker 0: It's raining.

10
00:00:53,584 --> 00:01:00,723
Speaker 1: Yeah this morning I was pretty much torn between because when it's warm out I have this problem where I don't want to take a coat if I Don't have to.

11
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:04,040
Speaker 1: because if I take a coat and I don't have to know I got to carry it and it sucks.

12
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:10,133
Speaker 1: So I'll always check the weather I'll reach my hand out the window or something and decide if I'll take a coat or not.

13
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:13,279
Speaker 1: and the only coat I really have That's appropriate is my leather jacket.

14
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:21,139
Speaker 1: The problem with the leather jacket is you take it and if it rains now You're in trouble because you gotta like not get it too wet or that's no good.

15
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,754
Speaker 1: So I decided not to take it today and it rained.

16
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:28,223
Speaker 1: the worst possible Combination.

17
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:29,527
Speaker 1: it just sucked all around.

18
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:33,220
Speaker 0: see the thing is taking the truck taking my bike home in the rain.

19
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,628
Speaker 0: It's no big deal because it's not like.

20
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:35,775
Speaker 0: I wear my business clothes.

21
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:38,430
Speaker 0: I change on the train So everyone else is wearing.

22
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:44,917
Speaker 0: they're really stuffy expensive Uncomfortable dress clothes for whatever business they had in the city and I'm there in shorts and a t-shirt.

23
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:47,168
Speaker 1: just chillin I wear shorts and t-shirt to work.

24
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,093
Speaker 1: So it's all good.

25
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:49,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't get away with that.

26
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:51,019
Speaker 0: In fact, I often have to wear a tie.

27
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:52,225
Speaker 1: Haha, I've never.

28
00:01:52,286 --> 00:02:00,568
Speaker 1: I will never take a job where I ever have to wear a tie Unless I'm working for myself and I decide to wear a tie to impress some other business guy I want to make a deal with.

29
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,220
Speaker 0: so I don't mind riding home in the rain.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,600
Speaker 0: Like I said, I ride my bike in the rain all the time.

31
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:16,200
Speaker 0: This is no different But the looks I got from people as I got on my bike and started riding away People just couldn't seem to grasp the fact that I wasn't breaking out or taking a cab or something.

32
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:25,620
Speaker 1: Well at the same time I gotta say it was a little bit cold When I got off the train and it was raining, but that was probably because I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt.

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,616
Speaker 0: So yeah, I was also in shorts and a t-shirt and I was biking.

34
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:30,420
Speaker 0: wasn't that cold?

35
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:33,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't that cold, but it was a little cold and I had to run to my car.

36
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,046
Speaker 0: I only had a bike a couple miles.

37
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:38,040
Speaker 0: if I'd had to bike like five or six miles, then it would have been too cold.

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,523
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:43,000
Speaker 0: Oh, well this weird thing is now that I take my bike every day.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,877
Speaker 0: I've noticed that there are three other bikes and they're in good condition and they've been locked to the train station fence in The exact same positions unmoved for the entire week.

41
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:55,791
Speaker 0: so far They have not been touched in any way by a human.

42
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,760
Speaker 1: Maybe people went to the city for a week.

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,447
Speaker 1: Maybe people like leave those there.

44
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:00,712
Speaker 1: It's like when they come back.

45
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:01,817
Speaker 1: They you know get him.

46
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:02,460
Speaker 1: I don't know.

47
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,546
Speaker 1: That's a terrible idea.

48
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:06,040
Speaker 0: bikes rust immediately if you leave them out like that.

49
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:07,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,580
Speaker 1: But I do see quite a few people who bike to the train station at least maybe like ten people or so.

51
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,345
Speaker 1: So, you know, you're not alone.

52
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,050
Speaker 0: No, I was alone today though.

53
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I did see people taking the cab.

54
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:21,773
Speaker 1: Yep, people take the cab every day.

55
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:25,228
Speaker 1: I'm wondering what like People cab.

56
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:28,200
Speaker 0: every day a lot of people take the cab to my job.

57
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:31,136
Speaker 0: Every morning a bunch of cabs pull up and drop people off.

58
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:37,500
Speaker 0: really I really don't get it because a cab costs so much more money than any other means of transportation.

59
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean per mile.

60
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,853
Speaker 1: a cab is more expensive than an airplane.

61
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:43,878
Speaker 1: It's more expensive than a train.

62
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,184
Speaker 0: even worse It's in Yonkers.

63
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,590
Speaker 0: So it's not like it's a yellow cab.

64
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,956
Speaker 0: It's some car service.

65
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:52,229
Speaker 1: Oh god Yeah, car service is the most expensive way to get anywhere.

66
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,040
Speaker 1: running a car service is awesome because you get lots of money.

67
00:03:56,582 --> 00:03:59,557
Speaker 1: Because it does think about how much it cost me to drive.

68
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:06,188
Speaker 1: to say Otakon right it cost me what two tanks of gas at the most of 40 bucks Even add in my car payment.

69
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,980
Speaker 0: and whatever two tanks of gas for 40 bucks.

70
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,666
Speaker 0: Where are you shopping?

71
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,573
Speaker 1: 20 bucks for a tank of gas?

72
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:14,279
Speaker 0: It's not 20 bucks for a tank of gas.

73
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,579
Speaker 0: How many gallons does your car hold Scott?

74
00:04:18,363 --> 00:04:21,459
Speaker 1: It says 15, but usually it takes like 11.

75
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,628
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, so you're not using all of it for one.

76
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:30,567
Speaker 0: All right, multiply 11 by the current price of gas, which is currently 304 I still 60 bucks doesn't matter.

77
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:31,490
Speaker 1: I don't.

78
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:34,560
Speaker 1: I haven't bought gas in weeks because I've been riding the train.

79
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,398
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what we used to go a guy take a gas still wasn't 20 bucks and not even close.

80
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:41,031
Speaker 0: anyway You make.

81
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:50,486
Speaker 1: it is A cab right for the same trip would be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars Maybe even a thousand dollars.

82
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:53,980
Speaker 0: see it's just like with Kramer and the Michigan bottle scam.

83
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,539
Speaker 0: Your margins are all messed up now because you're using the wrong numbers.

84
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:02,857
Speaker 1: My numbers don't have to be that exact because the difference is so enormous.

85
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,420
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Did you read about those crazy people who took a cab like all the way out to like?

86
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,824
Speaker 1: Arizona or something?

87
00:05:09,884 --> 00:05:12,994
Speaker 1: because the airline wouldn't let him take their pets or something.

88
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:13,596
Speaker 1: We don't know.

89
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:26,331
Speaker 0: what all it was was that they're too old people and they're moving and they didn't want to drive themselves and They didn't want to go on the airline because they don't trust the airline to not kill their cats Which isn't that much of an unfounded fear?

90
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:28,720
Speaker 0: airlines tend to kill pets more often than they should.

91
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you could just like pay you could UPS the pets.

92
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:32,655
Speaker 0: No, you can't.

93
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:40,160
Speaker 0: no no There are very few services that transport pets specifically and they cost a lot more than higher in that cab.

94
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,128
Speaker 1: Oh, that's an entrepreneurial idea.

95
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:42,891
Speaker 0: It is indeed.

96
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,980
Speaker 1: Let's open up a little pet transportation.

97
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:53,682
Speaker 0: So now if we were clever Instead of actually transporting the pet we do what people did with that mail back in the day at the a similar pet get a Similar bed.

98
00:05:54,103 --> 00:06:00,560
Speaker 0: So you just have a stock at all the major cities of every genet generic kind of puppy and you only take puppies.

99
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:05,273
Speaker 1: And Yeah, and you just mail the tags to the other side.

100
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:09,755
Speaker 0: you put the tags on a similar But forget that why you mail in the tags you have a tag fad.

101
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:13,639
Speaker 1: Ooh You just make the test copy the tags on the other end.

102
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:17,973
Speaker 1: Yeah, what if they have some sort of like unique handmade collar or something like that?

103
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,160
Speaker 0: Uh, we don't accept collars.

104
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,672
Speaker 0: It's dangerous because we take such good care of the puppies.

105
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:24,399
Speaker 0: We don't want them to have a collar on.

106
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:26,558
Speaker 0: It's too perfect.

107
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:32,438
Speaker 0: Okay, okay anyway, so in the news the Naruto movie.

108
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:36,513
Speaker 1: well I don't know much about Naruto so I can't tell you anything about this movie.

109
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:38,480
Speaker 0: Well, I know I know enough about Naruto.

110
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,180
Speaker 0: It is about ninjas and they fight and fights last between one and one thousand episodes.

111
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:48,147
Speaker 1: I knew that yes But this movie is.

112
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:51,280
Speaker 0: the movie is about these ninjas engaged in some sort of fight.

113
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:53,086
Speaker 0: It lasts one movie.

114
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:56,758
Speaker 1: I can guarantee that the movie will contain the character Naruto.

115
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,599
Speaker 1: at least There will be at least one other character.

116
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:09,440
Speaker 1: there will be fighting and Ninjas throwing those pointy things with spirally thing headbands and all the stuff that Naruto is known for as long as Kakashi's in the movie.

117
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,104
Speaker 0: Otherwise, there's no reason to watch.

118
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:16,980
Speaker 1: I know anyway this movie Naruto the movie ninja clash in the land of snow.

119
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,279
Speaker 1: Oh, I guarantee there'll be snow in this movie.

120
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:23,892
Speaker 1: It's actually going to be in theaters in the US.

121
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,400
Speaker 0: not only that that's not a big deal.

122
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,029
Speaker 0: I mean, we're gonna go see paprika in the theater.

123
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,900
Speaker 0: It's not like anime is not in the theater often.

124
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:36,700
Speaker 1: Yep Pretty much all the big anime movies anything bigger than a drop in the bucket ends up at at least one theater in the US.

125
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:45,359
Speaker 1: But this Naruto movie which I know nothing about other than what we've already said is going to be on 160 screens in North America.

126
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:48,169
Speaker 0: That's not every theater by far.

127
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,360
Speaker 0: no, it's not a small release but not too bad.

128
00:07:51,581 --> 00:08:07,831
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually something like paprika is like, all right It's four screens in New York ten in Texas five in California one in Seattle There's that one in Philly one in Philly one in Connecticut and then if you're lucky one Nowhere near Florida.

129
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:08,999
Speaker 1: animal doesn't get dick.

130
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:13,131
Speaker 1: But yeah, you'll usually get like 20 screens.

131
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:19,900
Speaker 1: 30 screens I mean 50 screens would be a big deal, but this one's gonna have a hundred and sixty screen.

132
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:23,452
Speaker 1: That's pretty much every major city and then some.

133
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:25,980
Speaker 1: so no matter where you live in the country.

134
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:37,900
Speaker 1: I mean on average if there's 50 states including Hawaii and Alaska 160 screens it's gonna be in at least three places in your state or at least somewhere within driving distance.

135
00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:49,500
Speaker 0: I would however wager that some states due to Socio-economic factors may have more of an audience for foreign Japanese cartoons than certain other states.

136
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:58,470
Speaker 1: Yes, I can imagine that the five screens that I'm allocating to Kansas are actually in California But I don't think Utah is gonna be so rocking it there.

137
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,440
Speaker 1: No, Nevada might have some though, and that's pretty close.

138
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, Hawaii definitely will.

139
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:04,973
Speaker 1: oh, I will have some Alaska.

140
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,700
Speaker 0: I don't even know if they get movies up there.

141
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:07,403
Speaker 0: That's like the.

142
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:10,455
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about a projector at the snow.

143
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:21,900
Speaker 1: They don't have screens Yeah, but yeah It's pretty big news that an anime movies actually gonna get a better than an incredibly small release in American theaters.

144
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:25,469
Speaker 0: well the thing is Naruto as a film.

145
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:39,960
Speaker 0: I'll bet they would treat it more like a typical kids cartoon film movie than they would any other kind of anime because it's definitely not geared at the Relatively small demographic of people our age who like shiro tasm.

146
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:45,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is definitely marketed at 12 to 12 and a half year old kids.

147
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:50,280
Speaker 1: I have a feeling it's gonna get treated like the later Pokemon movies got treated.

148
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:58,720
Speaker 1: You know cuz like I remember the original Pokemon movies like theaters everywhere And I think the later ones were still in theaters, but not theaters everywhere.

149
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,260
Speaker 1: You know I've never seen a Pokemon movie me either, but I heard that like the early ones are kind of okay.

150
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:07,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I they were watching when they said you can't hold ten Pokemon.

151
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:09,731
Speaker 0: I kind of want to watch the first movie.

152
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:12,766
Speaker 0: the plots kind of cool, but then again This is the time for Pokemon.

153
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:19,480
Speaker 0: I mean I'd never played a Pokemon season rabbit season Pokemon see I'd never played a Pokemon game.

154
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:19,941
Speaker 0: I'd never.

155
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:25,236
Speaker 0: the only Pokemon I knew was the good manga the bad manga and the anime.

156
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:38,580
Speaker 1: as far as I'm concerned I've watched the anime, and I've played bad video games And I looked at the bad manga once and the only Pokemon I care about is the main line of video games and the good manga you mean the one with red and yellow.

157
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:44,806
Speaker 1: Yes, the games that are Pokemon color or Pokemon gemstone Those are the ones that are worth playing.

158
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:45,308
Speaker 1: everything else.

159
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:54,720
Speaker 1: I couldn't give a shit except Pokemon snap which is okay, but It's only worth playing once and Pokemon puzzle league which is actually paneled upon.

160
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:58,500
Speaker 1: So there's no reason to play Pokemon puzzle league when you can just play paneled upon.

161
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:01,467
Speaker 1: So yeah Naruto in the theaters.

Speaker 1: theaters is it and real?

169
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:47,038
Speaker 0: just to warn you only one news tonight Because we've got a lot of anime to talk about and we figure it's new anime season.

170
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:47,540
Speaker 0: give or take.

171
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:52,900
Speaker 0: We've got a lot of shows to cover in relatively short time before they become irrelevant.

172
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:58,275
Speaker 1: Yep, we basically watched a whole bunch of new shows at least the first episode

173
00:11:58,555 --> 00:11:59,999
Speaker 0: and a couple of old shows and

174
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:09,980
Speaker 1: a couple shows that we watched the number one episodes of a bunch of shows that are brand new and we're gonna let you know whether we Think they're worth watching based on the first episode alone.

175
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:18,238
Speaker 0: things of the day.

176
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:29,186
Speaker 0: Scott had something old so I had something old - I brought this up mostly because I remember seeing this exact Advertisement on Television when I was young.

177
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:30,852
Speaker 1: I don't remember it at all.

178
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:39,228
Speaker 0: not only that but back then I don't know if this still happens, but a lot of children's shows would have Messages like that at the end of them.

179
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:39,569
Speaker 1: Well.

180
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,417
Speaker 1: I think there was some sort of like law.

181
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:52,340
Speaker 1: actually Like you know this laws like you can't advertise certain like the toy for the show during About the but you know by the way, you know the more you know or anything like that.

182
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,280
Speaker 0: I was talking very specifically about sexual harassment.

183
00:12:56,461 --> 00:13:03,219
Speaker 0: Okay, I there were several shows that had hey kids if somebody touches you in a bad place tell someone.

184
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,500
Speaker 1: I Don't remember ever seeing any of them.

185
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,136
Speaker 1: But then again, I don't remember any of those at all whether they were about sexual harassment or something else.

186
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:14,579
Speaker 0: see I used to watch He-man and I did used to watch he-man, and I barely remember it.

187
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:19,638
Speaker 0: yeah I remembered very well, and I remember now that I'm older wiser smarter stronger better.

188
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:24,815
Speaker 0: I Recognize that he-man is perhaps one of the worst shows ever made.

189
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:25,940
Speaker 1: he-man is so bad.

190
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,824
Speaker 1: I was so disappointed that when I finally had the Internet's and I thought hey he-man That's a show.

191
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,213
Speaker 1: I know I liked when I was a kid.

192
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,160
Speaker 1: I had a bunch of the toys.

193
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,979
Speaker 1: I know I watched it, and I know I liked it.

194
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:42,595
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go and get it and watch it and see you know cuz I don't remember it so well I'm gonna see what it's like and it was terrible good.

195
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:43,400
Speaker 1: God was it bad.

196
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:53,903
Speaker 1: It's so bad and I cats and transformers very watchable Thundercats the most so actually Voltron the most so but he-man unwatchable on Watchable.

197
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:56,250
Speaker 1: so I couldn't think of a thing of the day really.

198
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,477
Speaker 0: so how we never have that problem.

199
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah I'm just as guilty.

200
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:00,958
Speaker 0: It's not like.

201
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:06,340
Speaker 1: So I started thinking of things that had to do with anime or comics from the way back.

202
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,352
Speaker 1: I try set my mind into the past and I actually dug something up.

203
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:17,877
Speaker 1: I remembered a long time ago like perhaps 2099 times there was a fun anime plot generator on the Internet's.

204
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:20,968
Speaker 1: and well I searched for anime plot generator, and I found it.

205
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:22,533
Speaker 1: so you ready to hear some anime plots.

206
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:24,620
Speaker 0: I'm ready all right.

207
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:24,962
Speaker 1: here We go.

208
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:26,254
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make a random anime plot.

209
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:38,640
Speaker 1: in Modern-day Japan a team of young psychic cyborg gun loving cops battle gang of evil Psychics androids criminals and destroy the city in the heat of combat sounds a lot like tank police.

210
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:54,269
Speaker 1: Yep, in Chicago a young brooding hero travels on an eternal quest acquiring one or two loyal companions While seeking wealth and fortune and does battle with evil demon psychic overlord and his lieutenants and Triumphing moves on to the next installment.

211
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,760
Speaker 0: that sounds a lot better than some of the anime we watch.

212
00:14:57,221 --> 00:15:02,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you're looking to have some laughs, maybe make a new anime.

213
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:05,151
Speaker 1: May make a webcomic.

214
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:06,980
Speaker 1: who knows fanfiction?

215
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:11,714
Speaker 1: Go to the random anime plot generator, and it'll save you a lot of time and effort.

216
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:21,975
Speaker 1: so today like we said We are going to not review, but sort of give first impressions of Four new anime out the season.

217
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:25,934
Speaker 1: actually one of them I think is from last season, but it's pretty damn recent.

218
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:26,737
Speaker 1: so it doesn't matter.

219
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:33,120
Speaker 0: yep And we're gonna do a bunch more shows like this in the next several weeks because we've watched a lot of new anime.

220
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:35,940
Speaker 1: Without further ado let's get on with this business.

221
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,422
Speaker 1: We why?

222
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:48,124
Speaker 1: oh well first of all we watched one episode of each of these and we're going to spoil Probably those first episodes, so if you want to be surprised by something in the first episode Yeah, you probably don't want to listen.

223
00:15:48,405 --> 00:16:00,240
Speaker 0: see the thing is the only spoiler a first episode can ever have really is oh The show is not about what you thought it was about and that's really the only thing that could be spoiled in a one episode.

224
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,506
Speaker 0: Shot of a real full-on show.

225
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:09,919
Speaker 1: yeah well technically you know there are those shows where on a pond the second viewing there are things In the first episode that spoil the whole show.

226
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,800
Speaker 1: But no one who hasn't seen the end could possibly see those things in the first episode.

227
00:16:14,926 --> 00:16:21,400
Speaker 1: Yeah Like you could watch the opener to Evangelion in slow motion to watch every frame and a lot would be spoiled for you.

228
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:29,854
Speaker 1: Or you could watch the first episode of antenna and the whole show could be spoiled for you But only if the show's already been spoiled for you if we've already seen the whole show

229
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:32,604
Speaker 0: otherwise or you're some kind of psychotic Genius

230
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:35,480
Speaker 1: thing if you're so psychic powers or something.

231
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:39,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's no way you're gonna figure out the end of a tenor from the first episode.

232
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:46,540
Speaker 1: But if you've seen the last episode then you will realize that it is possible, but not possible anyway.

233
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:47,765
Speaker 0: So let's jump right in.

234
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:53,349
Speaker 0: yeah the first show we watched El Cazador de la Bruja What does that translate to?

235
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,580
Speaker 0: it looks like it translates to the witch hunter?

236
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,759
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, which now that I've seen the first episode makes a little bit of sense.

237
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:04,358
Speaker 1: It does because the first episode does contain a witch and some bounty hunting action.

238
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:05,468
Speaker 0: now Here's the thing.

239
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:11,934
Speaker 0: the show starts out Awesome music that reminds me of other shows and the animation is really really pretty.

240
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:13,217
Speaker 0: the opener is really pretty.

241
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:14,400
Speaker 0: the show is really pretty.

242
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,819
Speaker 0: Everything about this show is incredibly cool except the show.

243
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:24,432
Speaker 0: Yeah, the whole time pretty much five minutes into it.

244
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:27,480
Speaker 0: You're gonna sit there and you're gonna think this is noir.

245
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,589
Speaker 0: Someone just made noir with a different skin.

246
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:34,540
Speaker 0: It's the exact same goddamn show except the colors are bright.

247
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:39,860
Speaker 0: Except unlike noir Nobody gets hung by a necktie in a stairwell.

248
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,587
Speaker 1: Yeah The violence is a lot more cartoon violence.

249
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:47,440
Speaker 1: the colors are brighter the characters are more stereotypical anime characters.

250
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:49,124
Speaker 1: It's got a sort of.

251
00:17:49,144 --> 00:18:00,260
Speaker 1: it's weird the setting because the setting is obviously the present day with present-day technology Like there's even scenes of people sitting in cubicles in an office doing work, but it's also Western.

252
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:09,529
Speaker 1: So I think it's like modern-day Mexico and some reason Japanese people think that all of Mexico is like Western town like you know from the 1800s.

253
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:13,080
Speaker 0: It's kind of weird, but the music was really good.

254
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,016
Speaker 0: However, the music doesn't fit the show at all.

255
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:23,260
Speaker 0: I mean at least noir Nominally until you see enough of noir to realize that there's actually nothing underneath that veneer.

256
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:35,280
Speaker 0: The music's really good But it sounded exactly like the music from noir and I'm thinking to myself while I'm watching all right did they just rip off or They're the same people involved?

257
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:48,253
Speaker 0: So now I finally look it up and sure enough the music for this show is done by Yuki Kajiura Who you might remember from noir dot hack all that Yep The person who makes the really good music exact same music and it's she's not.

258
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:53,180
Speaker 0: it's not just the person who makes the good music It's the person who makes the good music for the really crap anime.

259
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:55,126
Speaker 1: See the thing I don't understand right?

260
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:57,072
Speaker 1: is I really like this music?

261
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,320
Speaker 1: right that this person makes Yuki Kajiura?

262
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:15,059
Speaker 1: But she always makes the music for these kind of good not really so good anime And you can always tell her music right away Whereas Yoko Kano she also makes the really good music for the anime, but the anime she makes them for tend to be better.

263
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:24,286
Speaker 1: and Also, you can't always tell Yoko Kano music right away because she does all different kinds of music and this person seems to do the same Kind of music all the time.

264
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:26,296
Speaker 1: You can just tell it like oh, that's that person.

265
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:26,859
Speaker 1: I know.

266
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:29,568
Speaker 0: So the worst thing though is just that.

267
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:40,260
Speaker 0: I mean there was similar music that I don't think was done by her in Gundam seed and it was used sparingly in certain scenes where important things were going on and it added a lot.

268
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,528
Speaker 0: It made those scenes amazing in this show.

269
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:45,919
Speaker 0: They have the same level like oh, this is an amazing scene.

270
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:48,214
Speaker 0: The music is saying watch me.

271
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,000
Speaker 0: I'm amazing.

272
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:57,560
Speaker 0: But what's going on on the screen is Even worse than that noir kind of a girl running around shooting a bunch of people who for some reason never scream or bleed.

273
00:19:58,042 --> 00:19:59,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just it'll be like this.

274
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:12,870
Speaker 1: serious music like this is like an epic happening right here And this cartoon violence going on or like, you know, just kind of like a silly, you know slightly interesting But not too serious action scene of like haha.

275
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:15,780
Speaker 1: I kick you and I shoot the gun out of your hand and I smile.

276
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:22,205
Speaker 0: There's a lot of either shooting the guns out of people's hands or if someone shot somewhere where they would die There's no blood.

277
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:24,880
Speaker 0: They just fall over and disappear from the show forever.

278
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:33,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the worst part is the plot of the show is as far as I can see Exactly the same as noir.

279
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:40,848
Speaker 0: There's two female lead characters one of whom is older competent and cool and All-hit has a gun.

280
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:48,199
Speaker 0: The other one is young doesn't understand The world has something weird about her yet is magically super competent when she needs to be.

281
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:51,386
Speaker 1: It sounds like the noir guy.

282
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:52,650
Speaker 1: Well sure again.

283
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,332
Speaker 1: Sure enough.

284
00:20:53,673 --> 00:21:02,160
Speaker 0: This is directed by none other than Koichi Mashimo You may remember from such wonderful wonderful shows as dot hack and noir.

285
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:06,540
Speaker 1: So if you're a fan of the dot hack noir legacy the kill yourself.

286
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:10,139
Speaker 1: This is the next show for you by the same team.

287
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:27,228
Speaker 0: Yeah If you watched all 26 episodes of noir right up to the end where there's nuns with guns running around and you still liked it And you thought damn if only someone made another show that was exactly like this only in a Western modern Setting with brighter colors.

288
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:35,080
Speaker 0: See that's the other thing that the way a lot of the shots were put together in this Mexico which again as far as they're concerned Mexico is just the Wild West.

289
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:39,934
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was so much like the first episode of cowboy bebop.

290
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:44,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was painful and Like a scene of guys in a bar.

291
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,512
Speaker 1: Is it?

292
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:47,720
Speaker 1: you know, we're there old men talking.

293
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:56,416
Speaker 1: There's a scene of people sitting in a bar Then they shooting and the main of someone's sitting down with like a Native American fortune teller of some sort.

294
00:21:56,737 --> 00:22:06,909
Speaker 0: and the worst part is You walk in and we're all watching it together and I'm like you got any Bloody Mary's and everyone nobody I yeah They always order Bloody Mary can't get any.

295
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:07,953
Speaker 0: there's no tomato juice.

296
00:22:08,434 --> 00:22:09,980
Speaker 0: All right, you don't just say bloody eye.

297
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,931
Speaker 0: If you want a drug, you don't just walk around the street going.

298
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:13,975
Speaker 0: Hey got weed.

299
00:22:14,156 --> 00:22:15,100
Speaker 0: Hey, what about some weed?

300
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,940
Speaker 1: But don't drive with a mad woman.

301
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:25,620
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that this is not going to be a good show.

302
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,099
Speaker 0: This is gonna be noir part two.

303
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:36,084
Speaker 1: I think this will be a perfectly average anime in all respects and I will not spend my time watching it Anymore than I already have.

304
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:43,066
Speaker 0: there's even the semi mystical plot that you they don't tell you much about But no or had the same thing.

305
00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:46,420
Speaker 0: where there was that some sort of prophecy some sort of magic.

306
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:49,260
Speaker 0: Maybe we're not sure what's going on, but there's nuns at the end.

307
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like there are things that happened before the first episode that involved the younger girl Like, you know, why is she beat?

308
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,420
Speaker 1: Why does she have a bounty on her head?

309
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,973
Speaker 1: You know, did she actually kill someone or did she not kill someone?

310
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:01,435
Speaker 1: What is it?

311
00:23:01,535 --> 00:23:02,700
Speaker 1: What's this mysterious thing?

312
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:09,755
Speaker 1: how come she can jump over that very tall fence and the main character girl can't you know, and That's it.

313
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:19,368
Speaker 1: then for some reason the main character girl decides to stop bounty hunting this little girl and to protect her from the bounty hunters instead as Is painfully obvious is going to happen.

314
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:22,037
Speaker 0: Oh, don't forget the mild lesbian overtones.

315
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, and the scantily clad main character?

316
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:31,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, the main character basically wears a poncho and not much else.

317
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:34,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's got like the short shorts And those aren't shorts.

318
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:40,059
Speaker 0: That's basically a tight jean loincloth And she wears a gun.

319
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:40,863
Speaker 0: I think.

320
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:45,780
Speaker 0: in fact her belt covers more of her skin than her pants do and it's like even the poncho barely covers the legs.

321
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,840
Speaker 1: See she's always showing off the leg and then when the poncho usually opens up during the fight scenes.

322
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:54,973
Speaker 1: So in the fight scenes, you're getting the sex and the violence together.

323
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:56,980
Speaker 0: Dave and Joel will be all about that.

324
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, if only it was good.

325
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:05,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's worth watching the first episode because there's also this really cute set of characters that they introduced But didn't do anything with.

326
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:08,414
Speaker 0: but it's not worth watching the show.

327
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:09,799
Speaker 0: I don't think to see what's up with them.

328
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:11,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the cute little girl.

329
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:15,379
Speaker 0: Well, I guess if you've never watched we're like one beer and one milk.

330
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:20,660
Speaker 1: Yep, if you never watched any of the shows by these people so you don't know what they're like watch noir.

331
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,668
Speaker 0: Don't watch this.

332
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:32,653
Speaker 0: I don't know this one Noir while it has probably one of the worst Second halves to any anime ever made in terms of how far downhill it went.

333
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:35,280
Speaker 0: that first episode was so badass.

334
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,119
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah The first episode was so badass.

335
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:40,207
Speaker 0: I mean that scene everyone knows.

336
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:43,900
Speaker 0: everyone who's seen noir remembers that one scene where she hangs the dude in the stairwell.

337
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:48,554
Speaker 1: Yeah well if you like Darker shows watch noir and if you like brighter shows watch this.

338
00:24:48,594 --> 00:24:51,085
Speaker 1: and if you know what kind of show this is Without watching it.

339
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:51,969
Speaker 1: Don't watch it.

340
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:54,099
Speaker 0: If you like really dumb shows you can watch that hack.

341
00:24:54,722 --> 00:24:58,477
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, 20 episodes of bla bla bla bla bla key off of the Twilight.

342
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,260
Speaker 0: All right.

343
00:24:59,702 --> 00:25:05,123
Speaker 1: So the next show we watched was the brand new and amazing Two-terra.

344
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:11,579
Speaker 1: remember we talked about the two-terra manga which is coming out now and is super awesome and sci-fi awesomeness.

345
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:17,870
Speaker 1: Well that we mentioned when we talked about that That there's gonna be a new show about that manga.

346
00:25:18,271 --> 00:25:22,184
Speaker 1: and lo and behold the show is out and we have watched one episode of it.

347
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:23,548
Speaker 0: now the show.

348
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:27,559
Speaker 0: when it first starts the very very beginning before the opener or anything.

349
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:38,384
Speaker 0: it Gave me the same feeling that the Phoenix at the new Phoenix anime did and that they it seems as though they're treating it with the proper level of respect and And faithfulness.

350
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:52,412
Speaker 1: Yep, the people who have made this anime version of two-terra Definitely have read the manga and they're sticking pretty close to it as close as can be expected and they definitely Capture the right mood and the right setting.

351
00:25:52,512 --> 00:25:56,999
Speaker 1: and they're they're not like, you know Just taking the idea and running away with it like nut cases.

352
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:01,438
Speaker 1: They're basically taking the manga and animating it for easy enjoyment.

353
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:04,260
Speaker 0: Yep Now they do take a bunch of liberties and change a few things.

354
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:15,908
Speaker 0: We'll get into that but they're really not doing any more than what the Phoenix people did with Phoenix because Phoenix has a lot of goofy characters and goofy things in it that they pretty much Completely removed from the anime.

355
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:18,378
Speaker 1: and yeah, the random Tezuka humors and things like that.

356
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:23,820
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, and there are similar things occasionally into terror which are also for the most part removed.

357
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:35,783
Speaker 0: But more importantly they change that stupid rocket sled Roller scooter through the inside of the planet whatever scene and they made it cool That.

358
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:40,440
Speaker 0: not to disparage the manga because the manga is amazing as least as far as I've read and I think it's going to continue.

359
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:48,218
Speaker 0: The second one's gonna be here in like next week but one of the major plot points when he goes into the amusement park and he gets on that ride.

360
00:26:48,238 --> 00:26:53,655
Speaker 0: if They had actually stuck and made the anime version exactly like what they show you in the manga.

361
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:55,400
Speaker 0: That would have been so lame.

362
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:02,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's sort of like how you read like American comics from the 70s and they're all super cornball.

363
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,900
Speaker 1: But the deep plot if you view it from far far away is actually good.

364
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:16,142
Speaker 1: It's just the writing and these specific happenings and the way it's presented is like, you know cornier than all of Nebraska This.

365
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:16,423
Speaker 1: they.

366
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:27,080
Speaker 1: they take the corn out and they make it presentable in the modern times and that's good for me And it's good for people who might not like the manga so much because it's kind of old and corny.

367
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:32,059
Speaker 1: This is much more accessible to them and you can get pretty much the same plot without being turned off.

368
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:45,080
Speaker 0: One thing I thought that was interesting a few liberties They did take is in the early early part before you find out what's actually going on And before everything really hits the fan and everything explodes and soldier blah blah blah, whatever, you know the stuff from the manga.

369
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:57,519
Speaker 0: they flesh out a lot of the minor or previously non-existent characters around Jomi in his life and Particularly, they flush out his mom and they add a lot more to him.

370
00:27:57,981 --> 00:28:17,247
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it's the manga definitely concentrated more at least the first volume on The plot surrounding the characters and like the huge big goings-on and you know Why everything was the way it is and the sci-fi plot and all that stuff and this seems to actually Concentrate on that less.

371
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:19,480
Speaker 1: it zooms in more on just what Jomi's doing.

372
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,297
Speaker 1: It doesn't show you a lot of what soldier blue and whoever else is doing.

373
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:28,600
Speaker 0: like the manga You get a lot of him interacting with his friends from before everything crazy happens.

374
00:28:29,156 --> 00:28:45,732
Speaker 1: Yeah you get scenes of like you know Jomi eating breakfast with his parents and when he it's funny cuz there's one part where he eats a hot like a sausage on a fork and then like the way they animate it is he moves the sausage towards his mouth and I get one frame the Sausage is there right in front of his mouth and the next frame the sausage just disappears.

375
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:58,160
Speaker 0: you Scott in this goddamn sausage Not when we were watching it We're all you know, just a very hot dog and suddenly Scott goes Oh my god That hot dog just disappeared and he backs it up and watches it again to point out that the hot dog disappeared.

376
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,380
Speaker 1: I watched it again today and the hot dog disappeared.

377
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:06,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they made they took I mean the parents.

378
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:10,904
Speaker 0: in the manga pretty much just exists for purposes of plot and that's all this As far as we've seen.

379
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:16,188
Speaker 0: obviously in the anime the dead The character is still one-dimensional.

380
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:21,644
Speaker 0: In fact, his character could be described as nothing more than stern But the mom.

381
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:31,758
Speaker 1: they made a character out of her not not a full character But they gave her enough that there would be some sympathy for the mom where in the manga It's just like she's the mom.

382
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:43,378
Speaker 1: so I think that's actually sort of necessary because modern anime and manga tend to deal a lot more with You know characters and people like, you know, it's more about the characters and less about plot.

383
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:43,900
Speaker 1: these days.

384
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:48,800
Speaker 1: So if they would have stuck with the plot heavy No one gives a shit about the characters kind of thing.

385
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:53,490
Speaker 1: Not too many people would have enjoyed it if they you know weren't already in on what's going on.

386
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:57,970
Speaker 1: There's also a funny scene where Jomie's playing soccer.

387
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,240
Speaker 1: Oh then and they have these robot referees.

388
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:02,749
Speaker 1: They're basically floating eyeballs.

389
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:04,619
Speaker 1: the referee the game and I think that's pretty cool.

390
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:11,060
Speaker 1: But then Jomie argues with the robot referee and he says it wasn't offsides or was offsides.

391
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:13,799
Speaker 1: He says it wasn't offsides and the robot called him offsides.

392
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:15,186
Speaker 1: So his goal didn't count.

393
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:17,820
Speaker 1: and then Jomie just smashes the robot referee.

394
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,140
Speaker 0: It's it just spikes it right into the crown and it's pretty hilarious.

395
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,620
Speaker 0: Not only is it hilarious, but that comes up again more than once in the rest of the episode.

396
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, they make an offsides joke.

397
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:29,774
Speaker 1: I laughed.

398
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:30,600
Speaker 1: I lolled.

399
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:36,776
Speaker 1: The only other thing is that there's a. there's a battle scene in the in this episode in the battle scene.

400
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:38,601
Speaker 1: It's pretty bad It.

401
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,083
Speaker 0: it could be really cool.

402
00:30:40,323 --> 00:30:50,040
Speaker 0: the the the computer that he is facing off with when it's trying to erase his memories is very Interesting aesthetically and it could have been a well-done scene.

403
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,160
Speaker 0: However, they show it to you on screen far longer than it should have been on screen.

404
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:02,669
Speaker 0: You start to notice that it looks kind of weird and cockeyed and then the best way I can describe it is when Jomie is Fighting with the thing.

405
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:04,789
Speaker 0: It's basically Bonk.

406
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:07,667
Speaker 0: Yeah, bonk Bonk.

407
00:31:08,442 --> 00:31:11,275
Speaker 1: Well, there's gonna be 24 episodes of this thing.

408
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:21,160
Speaker 1: We've seen one and If I don't watch them all fansubbed I'll watch them all someday Netflix cuz I can guarantee that someday this will be available in the United States for your buying pleasure.

409
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,527
Speaker 0: Yep, definitely gonna finish the manga first.

410
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:23,989
Speaker 1: Yes.

411
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:27,299
Speaker 1: There's only three volumes of the manga and we're getting the second one in a week.

412
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,518
Speaker 1: So I think we're gonna be finished with that way before we watch 24 episodes of this.

413
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:36,780
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, the next show is a show I just discovered.

414
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:47,820
Speaker 1: I thought actually I thought that this was a show from last season because I felt like I had it in my folder for a Long time, but actually it says on anime news network encyclopedia that it came out on April 8th this year.

415
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,425
Speaker 1: So I guess it's a new show.

416
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,112
Speaker 1: It's actually I think a new gonzo show.

417
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:53,978
Speaker 1: It's called ha boku.

418
00:31:54,038 --> 00:32:13,792
Speaker 1: Rano B. Okay, you are a no Well, if you haven't listened to us or anime world order or David Joel before you'll know that gonzo shows are typical For having really awesome first episodes really awesome premises really great animation and then as the show continues Everything just goes downhill from there and it's a big disappointment.

419
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:16,320
Speaker 0: It's like what if we made an anime about blah?

420
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be really cool.

421
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:19,069
Speaker 0: They get to episode 22.

422
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:20,373
Speaker 0: They're like, how do we end this?

423
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:21,518
Speaker 0: I don't know.

424
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:21,879
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

425
00:32:22,502 --> 00:32:27,340
Speaker 1: So I'm hesitant to give a positive view to this show because it follows the gonzo trend.

426
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:30,820
Speaker 1: The first episode of course is great and later on it won't be so great.

427
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:34,792
Speaker 1: However, I'm gonna review just this episode.

428
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:39,939
Speaker 1: it was pretty damn great both in its execution and in the premise.

429
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,934
Speaker 1: basically what this show is about is you have these 15 kids and They're bored in the summer and they're all sort of friends with each other.

430
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:51,787
Speaker 1: Maybe they're at a summer camp Maybe they're at school something like that I don't know.

431
00:32:52,316 --> 00:32:54,387
Speaker 1: and They're hanging out on the beach one day.

432
00:32:54,768 --> 00:33:15,300
Speaker 1: and what they do in this first beach scene is they introduce you to all the different Characters and they've got characters like covering every possible base, you know, the shy kid, you know the strong leader kid You know the the girl who doesn't talk so much the Gabby girl the bad kid The really cute young fourth grader girl where everyone else is in seventh grade

433
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,002
Speaker 0: I gotta say.

434
00:33:16,022 --> 00:33:22,900
Speaker 0: for the most part the short bit of interaction between all these characters is generally pretty realistic and well-executed.

435
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:26,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually it's like the first part of the show like five minutes.

436
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:33,665
Speaker 1: all you see is these characters interacting with each other on the beach as kids would and It's totally believable.

437
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:37,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, it introduces you to all the characters by the end of the first episode.

438
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:44,602
Speaker 0: You already might not remember all their names But you already know what all the characters are like to a degree and you already feel like you have Something.

439
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,049
Speaker 0: you have some sort of investment in all of them.

440
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it doesn't seem like this show has a main character.

441
00:33:50,480 --> 00:34:03,580
Speaker 1: I mean some of the kids are more important than others or more central But none of them gets enough, you know lead time to say aha That's the character who's really the number one and all the other kids are just kind of behind them.

442
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,139
Speaker 1: It seems like a really even deal.

443
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,829
Speaker 1: so you need to you know get some you know something about all of them in order to enjoy the show.

444
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:12,152
Speaker 1: and Then what happens after?

445
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:18,081
Speaker 1: that is the kids are bored They go exploring and they go into a cave and to explore the cave because it's plunking is fun I guess.

446
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:21,940
Speaker 1: and in the cave they see something better than rocks and bats.

447
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:26,206
Speaker 1: They see computers What the fuck computers doing in a cave.

448
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:33,047
Speaker 1: and then a weird guy shows up who reminds me of characters from other anime But I can't quite put my finger on it.

449
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:45,788
Speaker 1: Like he seems like all those scientist guys, you know, who are all Sort of like but he's also sort of mysterious and that he doesn't talk so much and he doesn't say any more than he has To yeah, he's got those circular glasses that light up.

450
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:46,650
Speaker 0: Well the end.

451
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,574
Speaker 0: Yeah the professor Tomoe glasses.

452
00:34:48,655 --> 00:35:00,388
Speaker 0: Yep, but the way he Says things and I mean obviously I'm relying heavily on the fansubbers and I don't know how good the fansubs were But he always like they say oh, is this a game?

453
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:03,076
Speaker 0: and he'll say something like yeah game that works.

454
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:12,811
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, anyway He tells these kids that they're gonna play that he's making a game and I don't know why these kids don't question Why a guy's making a game in a cave?

455
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:20,740
Speaker 0: Well, some of them do they're like But a few of them are oh cool, and I don't know I probably been ooh cool Yeah, cuz I wouldn't expect what happens to happen.

456
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:30,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he says you can all be the beta testers and they're like, oh, okay So, you know, he says all right, just walk up to this thing say your name and touch it with your hand.

457
00:35:30,388 --> 00:35:33,139
Speaker 1: so they do so except for the little girl who doesn't want to.

458
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:45,955
Speaker 1: and He says all right this in the game There's you know, 15 attacking aliens and you have a robot you have to defend the earth from the aliens Alright, and then there's static and the kids wake up on the beach.

459
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,092
Speaker 1: Oh snaps What the hell's going on here?

460
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:50,220
Speaker 1: It's craziness.

461
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,100
Speaker 1: All right, you know the same.

462
00:35:53,945 --> 00:36:01,419
Speaker 0: Now one really interesting thing and I really don't think this had anything to do with commercial breaks Is that periodically whenever there's a break in the action?

463
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:11,220
Speaker 0: there'll be this sudden cut of static and then you'll be in a new scene and I really really really really get the impression that this is a new tennis style.

464
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:18,391
Speaker 0: Hey, you're just gonna think get used to the static and not worry about it But then the static is actually something important later in the show.

465
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:23,255
Speaker 1: The static is definitely something important But what it is, I cannot bet on.

466
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:28,385
Speaker 1: right now I have a few hunches, but there are definitely a bunch of hunches But I can't.

467
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:31,140
Speaker 1: I don't have any evidence to support anyone over the other.

468
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,339
Speaker 1: All I know is that one of them is probably true and the others are all false.

469
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:38,049
Speaker 1: Anyway, what ends up happening?

470
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,180
Speaker 1: Of course is that it's not a game.

471
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:52,570
Speaker 1: they have a robot and they need to defend the earth from other robots and it's a really great scene when they fight the robot with their robot because they The actual fighting is not so interesting.

472
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:59,430
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that no one else can see either of these battling robots except the kids and the scary scientist guy.

473
00:36:59,872 --> 00:37:03,790
Speaker 1: But the effects of the robot battle are felt throughout the city.

474
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:15,470
Speaker 1: so there'll be crazy weather and storms and waves and earthquakes and lightning and all sorts of stuff but None of the people will see these robots so they'll just be like OMG this is crazy weather and earthquake.

475
00:37:15,915 --> 00:37:17,049
Speaker 1: I hope the kids are alright.

476
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:31,050
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, the kids are fighting these robots that are making all this terrible weather and such and they're the only ones who realize that The earth is under attack from horrible robots and they're the only ones who can defend the earth with their own robot.

477
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:50,290
Speaker 0: Plus the the way they actually fight and especially the first fight that you see where the guy who set all this up is very much just sitting there explaining to them how it all works in a very matter-of-fact way and half of them are freaking out and Some of them are paying attention and the way they set up the fighting and the way they set up the control of the robot.

478
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:54,469
Speaker 0: It's really interesting and I don't want to say exactly what it is.

479
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:58,649
Speaker 0: I just want you to watch the show and I want to see where they run with this.

480
00:37:59,163 --> 00:38:07,950
Speaker 1: Yeah Even if this turns out to be another gonzo bust this first Episode was so great that I say you should watch it until it turns crap.

481
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:10,950
Speaker 1: I mean if the first one's enjoyable, right?

482
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:18,098
Speaker 1: Even if the end is crap You can keep watching it as long as it's enjoyable get enjoyment out of it And as soon as it's no longer enjoyable just stop.

483
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,183
Speaker 1: It'll be worth it.

484
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:26,150
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah sure It would be nicer if the ending was actually awesome and this whole thing was great, but I can't guarantee that's gonna happen.

485
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:31,025
Speaker 1: However, this thing isn't very likely to have that many episodes for reasons.

486
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:31,908
Speaker 1: I will not go into.

487
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:35,923
Speaker 1: I mean Anime news network only knows eight episode names.

488
00:38:36,104 --> 00:38:37,730
Speaker 1: So it might just be an eight episode show.

489
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:38,145
Speaker 1: I don't know.

490
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:44,074
Speaker 0: Oh plus Emily did watch more of it and she said a few things that we're not going to repeat because they might be a Little spoiler.

491
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,323
Speaker 1: ish or they might not be true.

492
00:38:45,363 --> 00:38:46,068
Speaker 1: I'm not sure yet.

493
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:49,511
Speaker 0: Yeah We're not exactly sure where the show goes at all yeah,

494
00:38:50,033 --> 00:39:10,090
Speaker 1: but I do think that this is a good chance of being a great show because Gonzo tends to screw up shows way past, you know towards the later episodes and if they keep this show short and the premise is Strong and it seems like this premise has like a built-in good ending So they can't just fuck it up by trailing off at the ending.

495
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,028
Speaker 1: They have to go with the ending that the premise implies or something related to that.

496
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:18,590
Speaker 0: now This might sound a little strange and I don't know how many people out there have actually read this book.

497
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:34,758
Speaker 0: It was part of an assignment for school when I was in elementary school so I ended up reading it, but the plot on a very Hard to explain level really reminds me of this sci-fi novel called interstellar pig that I read God how many years ago?

498
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:37,450
Speaker 1: I've never heard of this and I know nothing about it.

499
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:46,090
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not gonna say what the plot of interstellar pig is because I don't know if there's any relation at all Or if it would be any sort of spoiler or anything.

500
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:56,889
Speaker 0: And also I want to see more of the show because it's very likely that there's just no connection at all But at least the plots feel similar in terms of what might actually be going on.

501
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:02,790
Speaker 1: Yep, so bokurano a show worth keeping an eye out for a in the long run.

502
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:06,786
Speaker 1: This will probably also be available in the US and it'll probably only be on a few DVDs.

503
00:40:06,826 --> 00:40:07,207
Speaker 1: cuz I don't.

504
00:40:07,328 --> 00:40:10,720
Speaker 1: I don't see this Being more than like 15 16 episodes.

505
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,744
Speaker 1: There's no way it's gonna be 26.

506
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:12,948
Speaker 1: That'd be crazy.

507
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:14,514
Speaker 1: So Cool.

508
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:25,070
Speaker 1: So last and least last and most You might remember we reviewed a show a while back called Gog manga Biori Gog you Bongo Biori.

509
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:36,329
Speaker 1: It's one of those totally wacky comedy shows from Japan with the Japanese Humor that's very Japanese that Americans can't really understand without lots of help.

510
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:45,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, granted if you've watched enough anime and you have watched if you get used to it This is the kind of humor that you're probably going to start understanding whether you realize it or not.

511
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:54,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you can understand as a manga daioh and Cromartie high school and the first season of Gog manga Biori You can understand the second season of Gog manga Biori.

512
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:58,866
Speaker 0: I gotta say the show is picking up right where it left off and I love it.

513
00:40:58,906 --> 00:40:59,830
Speaker 0: is what my favorite shows.

514
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:05,770
Speaker 1: They changed the opener but with they have a similar style song about Waikiki beach or something.

515
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:12,509
Speaker 1: And then at the open at the end of the opener, they still go Gog manga Biori And then the closer they still go.

516
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:27,906
Speaker 1: Yep and basically, there was an episode in the first season that had a joke about a bunny detective girl in school and It was a pretty funny episode.

517
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:34,190
Speaker 1: in this The first episode of the second season is just more of the high school bunny girl detective.

518
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:38,010
Speaker 0: I don't know why it's the same joke every time but I laugh at it every single time.

519
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,885
Speaker 1: The high school bunny girl detective is a great joke as the joke basically goes like this.

520
00:41:41,905 --> 00:41:47,810
Speaker 1: There's a school There's a bunny girl who's a detective in the class sort of like encyclopedia brown or whatever.

521
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,010
Speaker 1: She's talking to this bear guy this bear kid.

522
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:53,620
Speaker 1: The bear kid is like can't be a bear right?

523
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,330
Speaker 1: the bear kid is like, oh there haven't been any incidents lately.

524
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,498
Speaker 1: She's like, yeah, I wish I could do some detecting.

525
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:01,790
Speaker 1: then he's like, uh, then she'll say something like why don't you go?

526
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,837
Speaker 1: Die in a fire.

527
00:42:02,877 --> 00:42:03,684
Speaker 1: So there'll be an incident.

528
00:42:03,744 --> 00:42:06,915
Speaker 1: He's like no I'm not gonna go die in a fire.

529
00:42:07,377 --> 00:42:10,206
Speaker 1: Then there'll be an incident like, you know, oh something happened.

530
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:13,902
Speaker 1: Hmm and The bear guy will just talk to the bunny girl.

531
00:42:13,942 --> 00:42:15,430
Speaker 1: Like they'll be talking about the incident.

532
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,234
Speaker 1: I wonder who did it.

533
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:19,026
Speaker 1: then the bunny girl gets the eyes of doom.

534
00:42:19,107 --> 00:42:19,770
Speaker 1: I know who did it.

535
00:42:20,012 --> 00:42:24,417
Speaker 1: That's a lot better than the gums yep, and It's always the bear guy who did it.

536
00:42:24,557 --> 00:42:26,543
Speaker 1: and it's hilarious because you that it pans.

537
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:33,289
Speaker 1: it moves the camera out and you see him Doing the crime like right in front of the bunny girl, but he's talking like you didn't know it.

538
00:42:33,671 --> 00:42:36,386
Speaker 0: It pretty much always ends with him being taken away by the police.

539
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:46,117
Speaker 1: It's just great It's hilarious and it doesn't matter if you know what the joke is because when you actually zoom out and see what he's doing It's always funny no matter what.

540
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:49,389
Speaker 1: even if you've seen it before I watch this episode for the second time is still funny.

541
00:42:50,255 --> 00:42:55,618
Speaker 1: so yeah, if you like Humor, you should be watching Gogmog of B or E.

542
00:42:55,699 --> 00:43:00,314
Speaker 0: and if you haven't seen the first season don't even bother watching this yet Go find the first season.

543
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:02,400
Speaker 0: watch episode one.

544
00:43:02,741 --> 00:43:04,285
Speaker 0: If that doesn't hook you on this show.

545
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:04,867
Speaker 0: There's no hope.

546
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:05,890
Speaker 1: there's no hope for you.

547
00:43:06,372 --> 00:43:15,707
Speaker 0: I mean, that's still my favorite one and I've seen it like ten times because I just remember I was laughing Painfully hard at the end with the stick.

548
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:22,168
Speaker 0: Yeah well even like the I was laughing already and I was laughing and laughing and laughing and I'm about to stop laughing.

549
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:27,525
Speaker 0: my body says All right, you've left enough and then the sticker and I kept laughing but there's no more air.

550
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:28,950
Speaker 0: It was just too much.

551
00:43:31,773 --> 00:43:33,389
Speaker 1: Take care of Coon is the only one in my.

552
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:42,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was really surprised though because you know I just I check anime ski every day to see if there's any new shows.

553
00:43:42,931 --> 00:43:45,005
Speaker 1: I look for the number one because that means a new show.

554
00:43:45,065 --> 00:43:47,235
Speaker 1: right and might I mean a new show?

555
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:57,270
Speaker 1: but it might mean a. you know the first episode of a show that hasn't I've never seen before and I didn't expect to ever see in my entire life more Gogmog of B or E. I thought I was done.

556
00:43:57,591 --> 00:43:58,875
Speaker 1: You know, I saw the whole first season.

557
00:43:58,895 --> 00:44:02,267
Speaker 1: that's over but no Gogmog of B or E 2 episode 1.

558
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:06,241
Speaker 1: I was like, yes Yes, oh, yeah can't get better than that.

559
00:44:06,522 --> 00:44:08,590
Speaker 1: there's no question whether this is gonna be good or not.

560
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:10,662
Speaker 1: I don't have to watch it to know if it's good or not.

561
00:44:10,843 --> 00:44:11,870
Speaker 1: and good and there it is.

562
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:16,610
Speaker 0: If you have any qualms about fan subs, the show's not getting licensed anytime soon.

563
00:44:16,922 --> 00:44:22,389
Speaker 1: Yeah If this gets licensed that'll be crazy and I'll buy like two copies just to show my support for that shit.

564
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:28,110
Speaker 0: if This show or a show of this level of I don't know localness to Japan.

565
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,173
Speaker 0: I mean how.

566
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:31,759
Speaker 0: what market is there for a show like this?

567
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,330
Speaker 1: how many people in America would I mean they license Cromartie?

568
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,795
Speaker 1: But this is even more Crazy than that.

569
00:44:38,935 --> 00:44:42,690
Speaker 0: This is beyond Excel saga because Excel saga at least is accessible in that.

570
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,881
Speaker 0: It's just weird a lot of the time and super wacky.

571
00:44:46,243 --> 00:44:48,270
Speaker 0: This is not wacky like that.

572
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,730
Speaker 0: It's zany in this kind of off-center way.

573
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:52,252
Speaker 0: It's it's.

574
00:44:52,754 --> 00:44:56,870
Speaker 0: it'd be almost sinister if it went any further with its concepts.

575
00:44:57,573 --> 00:45:02,169
Speaker 1: Harris Impact all Yeah.

576
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:17,229
Speaker 1: So if you missed the first season of Gog manga B or E and maybe you can't find it online Or if you enjoyed the first season of Gog manga B or E go download the second season Gog manga B or E Because if you don't you have no sense of humor and I don't care about you.

577
00:45:17,811 --> 00:45:21,205
Speaker 0: So, of course before we wrap it up once again remember Kinetic on.

578
00:45:21,606 --> 00:45:26,301
Speaker 0: it's a ways out yet But we're gonna be rocking that con where we're gonna be super rocking that con.

579
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:32,870
Speaker 0: this weekend two days from now is torque on torque On in Rochester, New York at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

580
00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:35,339
Speaker 0: Gig nights is appearing there in a panel though.

581
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:36,483
Speaker 0: Scott will not be joining me.

582
00:45:36,543 --> 00:45:38,190
Speaker 0: So it'll basically just be me.

583
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:43,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was thinking about going I was thinking about not going but now I'm thinking about not going.

584
00:45:44,149 --> 00:45:57,550
Speaker 1: so It's just not worth a five-hour drive to Rochester to do one panel and go to a game store And then come home and maybe eat a really good sandwich, but I can get a really good sandwich in the city.

585
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,258
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm just.

586
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:00,644
Speaker 1: I really don't want to drive either.

587
00:46:00,664 --> 00:46:02,436
Speaker 1: I got stuff to do here I don't know.

588
00:46:02,456 --> 00:46:03,709
Speaker 1: I need to go buy new shorts.

589
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:08,008
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'll go to any more Torah cons after this just because it's far away.

590
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:13,430
Speaker 1: and yeah I'm like other cons like if you weren't going yeah, like if you weren't going to this convention.

591
00:46:13,892 --> 00:46:18,170
Speaker 1: I would have gone because we promised to go and do the panel so I would have oh, oh, I'm not going.

592
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:21,321
Speaker 1: Yeah, you are no, I won't go we'll see.

593
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:22,164
Speaker 0: no I just won't go.

594
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:23,428
Speaker 0: now you have to go we'll see.

595
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:23,970
Speaker 0: what do you mean?

596
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:29,849
Speaker 1: We'll see because I wouldn't back down on a place you promised to appear but at the same time it's you know.

597
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you're anywhere near Rochester, New York, you definitely should go to tour con.

598
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,939
Speaker 1: It'll be worth your time if you live close by.

599
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,992
Speaker 0: yes, it has been very fun the two times I've got.

600
00:46:40,032 --> 00:46:44,530
Speaker 0: it is also very cheap and it is only one day so you don't need a hotel room or anything.

601
00:46:44,891 --> 00:46:49,445
Speaker 1: Yep, that's sort of also why it's not worth driving five hours because it's only one day.

602
00:46:49,465 --> 00:46:57,343
Speaker 1: so and you know I've been to tour con before and I went to RIT school for five years.

603
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,490
Speaker 0: So well, you see it's like ever here.

604
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:00,895
Speaker 1: I'm not in a rush to go back there.

605
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:05,089
Speaker 0: So for me Torah con is like my annual pilgrimage back to my spawning point.

606
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:08,832
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, you spawned before RIT I just.

607
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:15,257
Speaker 0: RIT is like the land where all of my geekery became Crystallized and I became the man that I am today.

608
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:18,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is sort of like the front row crew Mecca in a way.

609
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:23,110
Speaker 0: Yes, we have to make periodic pilgrimages or will become lame and have desk jobs.

610
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:32,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll probably go back there when there's something going down But actually I plan to go to at least several at least several RIT hockey games next year.

611
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:36,290
Speaker 1: Well, let's go to the one they play at Sacred Heart Which is near my right like five minutes from my parents house.

612
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,308
Speaker 0: Didn't we say we were gonna do that last year and we didn't?

613
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:41,870
Speaker 1: well We'll do it this year because my friend works at Sacred Heart as a sports guy.

614
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,276
Speaker 1: So he'll totally get us the hookup.

615
00:47:43,336 --> 00:47:46,270
Speaker 0: He'd better get us the hookup and then get us in his press.

616
00:47:46,852 --> 00:47:48,358
Speaker 1: He is the well, he's not the press.

617
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,345
Speaker 1: He's like the announce II talky guy.

618
00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:51,490
Speaker 0: So, can you get us in his press?

619
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:52,794
Speaker 1: I don't know what he can get us in.

620
00:47:52,835 --> 00:47:53,678
Speaker 0: I'll cover the game.

621
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:54,442
Speaker 0: I'll take pictures.

622
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:56,210
Speaker 1: No, they have people who cover the game.

623
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,178
Speaker 0: I'll cover the game better.

624
00:47:57,601 --> 00:48:08,110
Speaker 1: Anyway, they Also, we could probably go to the West Point game because they play army and that's not too far God army is one of the worst hockey teams ever till I heard they were kind of good.

625
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:13,835
Speaker 0: Maybe they are now but I I mean, I didn't know anything about the division one We were getting into.

626
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:20,523
Speaker 0: and I remember very clearly when I was at IBM I was like, hey my old school RIT is joining division one blah blah blah.

627
00:48:20,543 --> 00:48:21,526
Speaker 0: and I said all the stuff.

628
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:23,734
Speaker 0: and he says hey Is that where army plays?

629
00:48:24,136 --> 00:48:25,601
Speaker 0: and I said yes the Atlantic League.

630
00:48:25,762 --> 00:48:27,770
Speaker 0: and he said I used to play for army.

631
00:48:28,032 --> 00:48:29,669
Speaker 0: They're the worst hockey team to ever exist.

632
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:33,603
Speaker 1: Well, maybe it's different from when he played for them might be I don't know.

633
00:48:33,824 --> 00:48:35,430
Speaker 0: I haven't followed RIT hockey at all.

634
00:48:35,952 --> 00:48:44,889
Speaker 1: All I know is that RIT hockey did really well this year, but because they're brand new in the division one They're not allowed to be in any tournaments or win anything because they're brand new.

635
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:51,510
Speaker 0: So how much would that suck if you're the guy who won and you have to remember that the only reason you won is because?

636
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:55,253
Speaker 0: The team that was better than you was Statutorily prevented.

637
00:48:55,273 --> 00:48:56,316
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm winning the turn like.

638
00:48:56,376 --> 00:48:56,938
Speaker 1: imagine this.

639
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:59,245
Speaker 1: imagine like pick a sport right now.

640
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:00,970
Speaker 1: Let's say let's pick baseball.

641
00:49:01,451 --> 00:49:06,225
Speaker 1: Let's say I start a brand new baseball team an expansion team a team that never existed before.

642
00:49:06,305 --> 00:49:14,917
Speaker 1: the the beacon Front row crew nerds right brand new Major League Baseball team, but because we're a brand new team We're not allowed to win the World Series.

643
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,930
Speaker 1: Let's say we go the entire regular season undefeated.

644
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:19,495
Speaker 1: I know that's pretty much impossible.

645
00:49:19,595 --> 00:49:22,144
Speaker 1: But let's say it happens just for the sake of argument.

646
00:49:22,565 --> 00:49:23,468
Speaker 1: We're the best team.

647
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,708
Speaker 1: hands down No one can even hope to beat us.

648
00:49:26,355 --> 00:49:30,510
Speaker 1: But because we're a brand new team We're not allowed to go into the playoffs or win the World Series or anything.

649
00:49:30,895 --> 00:49:31,889
Speaker 1: That's what this is like.

650
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:37,267
Speaker 1: So hopefully in a year or two when RIT is actually allowed to win the tournaments and things.

651
00:49:37,748 --> 00:49:41,990
Speaker 1: they will Still be good and win because that would be awesome.

652
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:44,071
