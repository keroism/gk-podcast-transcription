1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,059
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, February 23rd, 2021.

2
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:10,300
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:13,590
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,136
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,156 --> 00:00:17,930
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are talking about Heaven's Vault.

6
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:20,528
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:34,359
Speaker 1: So, for a bunch of reasons, the way the room that I record Geek Nights in, where Emily and I use it as our working space during the day, the desks were kind of cornered to each other.

8
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:36,679
Speaker 1: For a bunch of reasons, just the way we set up the room.

9
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:44,940
Speaker 1: And I rearranged all that over the weekend because Emily has a brand new, ridiculously powerful computer and we wanted to make the right room.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,704
Speaker 0: It's not that powerful.

11
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,820
Speaker 0: My power computer is probably faster because that one doesn't have a GPU in it.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,706
Speaker 1: It has a 770 in it.

13
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:51,500
Speaker 0: Okay.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,082
Speaker 0: I have a 1070.

15
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:52,947
Speaker 0: My 1070 is probably more powerful.

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is, it depends on what you're doing with it.

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,815
Speaker 1: We got 10 cores up to 5.7 gigahertz.

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, if we played Star Wars Squadrons, I'd probably get more frames.

19
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:11,420
Speaker 1: I find, actually, so get this, Star Wars Squadrons won full frames in SteamVR Index.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,800
Speaker 1: Like, no problems.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,978
Speaker 1: If I put it on a monitor, my 1080 gets full frames if I run it at 1080p.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,360
Speaker 1: But if I run it higher than that at 4K, the GPU doesn't max out.

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,279
Speaker 1: The CPU does for some reason.

24
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:26,520
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,879
Speaker 1: I found that Star Wars, every time I get a stutter at all, which is rare, it's the CPU maxing out and I'm not sure why.

26
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:33,989
Speaker 1: Hmm.

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,360
Speaker 1: Something I noticed.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,540
Speaker 0: Here's something slightly related and interesting, right?

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,579
Speaker 0: So I opened up Adobe Premiere to do some videos, you know, testing stuff I was doing.

30
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:46,820
Speaker 0: And it's the first time I had used Premiere since getting the 4K monitor.

31
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:54,080
Speaker 0: And what was happening was I was playing a 4K video in Premiere, just like in the source import player, right?

32
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:55,540
Speaker 0: And it was choppy as hell.

33
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:56,750
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Well, that makes sense.

34
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,596
Speaker 0: I will make some

35
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,040
Speaker 0: proxies.".

36
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:01,020
Speaker 0: And I made the proxies and it was still choppy as hell.

37
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:01,948
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "What the fuck?

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,998
Speaker 0: Why is this choppy as

39
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:03,159
Speaker 0: hell?".

40
00:02:03,462 --> 00:02:05,120
Speaker 0: Because I was able to do that.

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,574
Speaker 0: My computer hardware hasn't changed and I've been able to watch 4K videos perfectly.

42
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,438
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, "Why would the monitor change the performance of the...".

43
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:13,980
Speaker 0: Right?

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,980
Speaker 0: And sure enough, I dragged the Premiere window over.

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,100
Speaker 0: Literally, it's running.

46
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,580
Speaker 0: It's playing a video and I'm dragging the window.

47
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,620
Speaker 0: And the window itself can't even move.

48
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:24,119
Speaker 0: It's moving very choppily.

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:24,926
Speaker 1: Whoa.

50
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:31,560
Speaker 0: And as soon as I get the window over to the old monitor with lower resolution, it starts playing beautifully.

51
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:34,060
Speaker 0: And the window moves smoothly.

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,358
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "What is it doing on this left

53
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:36,620
Speaker 0: monitor?".

54
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:41,560
Speaker 0: But I was able to get help from the Adobe Community Forum.

55
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,280
Speaker 0: Apparently, there's a feature called Mercury Transport.

56
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:54,120
Speaker 0: If you want Premiere to use your GPU, you enable the Mercury playback engine, right?

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,000
Speaker 0: So I have that enabled.

58
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,879
Speaker 0: You don't want to disable that.

59
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,890
Speaker 1: No, that is real important.

60
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,800
Speaker 0: But there's a related feature, Mercury Transport.

61
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:11,880
Speaker 0: And what that does is it basically lets you use another monitor as a full screen display of preview, instead of using the little things.

62
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:19,477
Speaker 0: So if you're a video person, you could have a bunch of extra monitors attached and be like, "Yeah, just show this full on that

63
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:19,780
Speaker 0: monitor.".

64
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:23,555
Speaker 0: And do your editing on maybe a monitor.

65
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:24,560
Speaker 0: that's not so expensive.

66
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:25,660
Speaker 0: You need your timelines.

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,920
Speaker 0: You don't need high fancy graphics just to see some waves and stuff.

68
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:34,380
Speaker 0: You just need the good color representation where you're actually watching the video.

69
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,439
Speaker 1: But you also want it to be completely full screen and not just another Premiere window over there with widgets in it.

70
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,699
Speaker 0: So apparently the solution, and I'm not saying it worked, the solution, but it's questionable about the quality of what's going on.

71
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,560
Speaker 0: I had the Mercury Transport feature.

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,120
Speaker 0: Somehow, the checkbox to enable the feature was enabled.

73
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,000
Speaker 0: But obviously, none of the monitors were configured to actually transport anything.

74
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:01,640
Speaker 0: And that was what was causing it.

75
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,520
Speaker 0: As soon as I completely disabled Mercury Transport completely, it worked beautifully on all the monitors.

76
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,080
Speaker 1: I was going to blame the metadata.

77
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,979
Speaker 0: I wasn't using it anyway, but that's why I was just having it on, causing that to happen.

78
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,020
Speaker 1: So redoing this whole room was a giant pain in the ass, but I ran cable channels and everything's nice and organized and it feels real good.

79
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,660
Speaker 1: The room's nice and symmetric.

80
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:31,460
Speaker 1: I moved the printer out of the way because that printer's so big it doesn't fit anywhere in this room.

81
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,319
Speaker 0: Do you even print stuff?

82
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:33,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what I print?

83
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,720
Speaker 1: Character sheets in non-COVID times.

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,160
Speaker 0: You're playing games online these days, so I need to print the characters.

85
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,620
Speaker 1: Someday we will be post-COVID and I'll be playing Blades in the Dark in person again.

86
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:42,879
Speaker 0: Someday.

87
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:44,239
Speaker 1: That day will come.

88
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,151
Speaker 1: Sure.

89
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:55,060
Speaker 1: So everything's set and Emily's computer is, other than the GPU situation, which we all know about, it's just a ridiculously powerful, amazing computer.

90
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:58,680
Speaker 1: And my computer feels a little weak compared to it, which is fine.

91
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:01,960
Speaker 1: My computer's running like a champ, even though I built it in 2016.

92
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,880
Speaker 0: My computer does what I need to do.

93
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,220
Speaker 0: It's only slow when there's a bug in Adobe software.

94
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:05,611
Speaker 0: Yep.

95
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:13,160
Speaker 1: The only thing hurting my computer right now, up until this morning, was I can't get a video card to replace that 1080.

96
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,220
Speaker 1: So this morning I wake up and I have not done anything to my computer, mind you.

97
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,660
Speaker 1: I have only done things to the left half of the room.

98
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:22,939
Speaker 1: My computer did not physically move at any point during all this.

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,380
Speaker 1: And I hear a bunch of loud clicking coming from the computer room.

100
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,754
Speaker 1: And my first thought is, "Oh shit, we fucked something up on the new computer.

101
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:31,814
Speaker 1: Oh

102
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:32,196
Speaker 1: no.".

103
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,479
Speaker 1: But I hope the pump isn't broken.

104
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:36,197
Speaker 1: And we gotta come in.

105
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:39,920
Speaker 1: And my computer that has not been touched is making the loud clicking.

106
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:46,340
Speaker 1: I'm assuming the Kraken has finally given up the ghosts, because it does not sound like a fan problem.

107
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:48,360
Speaker 1: But the computer is booted and working.

108
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no other moving parts in computers these days, right?

109
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,400
Speaker 0: And I guess I have magnetic drives still, but they don't spin up.

110
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,640
Speaker 1: I do, and I was worried about that a little bit, but I got raided.

111
00:05:57,121 --> 00:05:58,780
Speaker 0: They don't spin up, though, unless I do something.

112
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,040
Speaker 0: They just sit there unspun, so they don't make noise if I'm not sitting at the computer.

113
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:10,540
Speaker 1: Like, if I'm recording Geek Nights, those drives are spinning, because Geek Nights gets recorded to them because they are in a RAID 0.

114
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,923
Speaker 1: RAID 1.

115
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:13,820
Speaker 1: Anyway, so they're redundant.

116
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,320
Speaker 1: So I poke around a little bit, and basically I open up all the bits on my computer.

117
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:27,580
Speaker 1: Not one of my fans has failed, but one fan failed so badly that it's off axis and slamming into the sides.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,239
Speaker 1: So I just shoved some shims in there to prevent it from spinning.

119
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,757
Speaker 1: You just take it out.

120
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,319
Speaker 1: Because it's in my Kraken, and I don't have a replacement for it.

121
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,267
Speaker 1: So I just blocked it.

122
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:44,260
Speaker 1: I didn't want to unplug it, because I have to actually take more panels of my case off to get to the thing to unplug it.

123
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,832
Speaker 0: My fans are just on the front.

124
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:46,578
Speaker 0: I can just take them off.

125
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:52,160
Speaker 1: My fans are inside of a filtering enclosure that has a Kraken mounted to it in a push-pull.

126
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:58,840
Speaker 0: I mean, I have the same Kraken thing you do, I'm pretty sure, and it's just like the fans go in front of the radiator.

127
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,720
Speaker 0: They're not like, you know, I can take them off.

128
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,782
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're in front of the radiator.

129
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:10,160
Speaker 1: I can't take them out of the computer without removing the radiator, because they are mounted to the inside front of my case, and there's a filter that mounts in front of them.

130
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:12,313
Speaker 0: My filter's just a magnet.

131
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:12,879
Speaker 0: I just pop it out.

132
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is just a magnet, but the fans cannot come out from the front.

133
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:18,460
Speaker 0: Oh, anyway.

134
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:28,000
Speaker 1: So anyway, auditing the fans in my case, I noticed that my top fan has been doing that thing where it just kind of spins like lazily, because it's broken as well.

135
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,189
Speaker 1: And my rear fan...

136
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:33,620
Speaker 0: Maybe you should call out whatever brand of fans you bought, because apparently they're really shitty.

137
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,680
Speaker 1: They're all the standard Corsair, like the fan everyone fucking buys.

138
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,466
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure... The $30 Corsair Pro...

139
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,940
Speaker 1: No, what's the really good fan brand?

140
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,198
Speaker 0: I mean, let me look at the best fan brand.

141
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:46,420
Speaker 0: Hold on.

142
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,442
Speaker 1: Seems like the two best fans.

143
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:54,160
Speaker 1: right now, unless you're going for ridiculous stupid airflow, if you actually care about them being quiet, are the Nocturas or this one Corsair fan.

144
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,990
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, the Noctua-whatever.

145
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,936
Speaker 0: Those are the ones, right?

146
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:57,420
Speaker 0: Noctua.

147
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, Noctua and Corsair are still like the top two.

148
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,320
Speaker 0: Noctua's what I put in the HTPC, because I wanted to get the quietest ones.

149
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:13,337
Speaker 1: So right now, I've unplugged one fan that's broken and prevented another fan that's broken from spinning, and I just ordered all new fans.

150
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:14,980
Speaker 1: I'm gonna replace every fan in my stupid computer.

151
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,879
Speaker 0: That seems like a good idea, yeah.

152
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,840
Speaker 1: But that's the only thing that's gone wrong with this computer, so I feel like I made the right call in terms of how I put that thing together.

153
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,709
Speaker 0: Nothing's ever gone wrong with this computer.

154
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,400
Speaker 0: It's gonna explode during the show.

155
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:30,113
Speaker 0: Like I said, bugs in the Adobe software.

156
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,500
Speaker 0: Nothing wrong with the computer itself.

157
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:38,475
Speaker 1: So, in the news, Daft Punk, the legend, at least for now, has ended.

158
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:40,340
Speaker 1: After 28 years, Daft Punk is no longer.

159
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you didn't know this news, seriously.

160
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:47,319
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure there's some kids out there who are like, "Oh, that's the music my dad listens

161
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:47,500
Speaker 1: to.".

162
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:49,420
Speaker 0: Maybe, someone.

163
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:58,940
Speaker 1: I feel like that breaking of generational divides of music, that breakout is not as strong as it used to be, thanks to the long tail.

164
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,344
Speaker 0: Because there's more varies.

165
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:05,300
Speaker 0: There's no more thanks to the democratization of media.

166
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:08,540
Speaker 1: When I was in middle school, if I listened to anything...

167
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,600
Speaker 0: There is now no homogenization of pop culture.

168
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,800
Speaker 1: In middle school, like going to the CD store, everyone listened to pop, rock, alternative.

169
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:21,440
Speaker 1: There were weird demarcations that were very strict, and only super nerds listened to anything else.

170
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,760
Speaker 0: I mean, there is still music that is like, mega hits, right?

171
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:45,560
Speaker 0: You got your BTSs, you got your Drakes, you got all these kinds of people, but it's not like they only... Those things, despite being mega hits, are only defining for a large, but still sort of limited, finite segment of the population.

172
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:52,740
Speaker 0: It's like, yes, those X million people over there, that has defined whatever for them.

173
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,337
Speaker 0: But like, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, it is capable.

174
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,620
Speaker 0: You could play that song for someone else who's not in that bubble, even though it's an enormous bubble.

175
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,149
Speaker 0: And they would be like, "What the hell song is this?

176
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:04,834
Speaker 0: I never heard this

177
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:05,095
Speaker 0: song.".

178
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:23,160
Speaker 0: But if you go back to the 90s, and there were people who wore a Nirvana t-shirt and had... But if you just played "Smells Like Teen Spirit," people who didn't own a Nirvana album or a t-shirt knew what fucking song that was.

179
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,934
Speaker 0: Yup, they might not like it, but they recognized it.

180
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:27,679
Speaker 0: And that doesn't exist anymore.

181
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:35,760
Speaker 0: Now, you can play the biggest hit on the planet, and for some people it's defining, and for some people it's not.

182
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,319
Speaker 0: But Daft Punk was sort of in between the two times.

183
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:48,300
Speaker 0: They were still this mega hit that almost everyone should know, but I feel like not everyone.

184
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,155
Speaker 1: I would occasionally bump into... I remember we showed Interstellar 5555 at RIT Anime.

185
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,239
Speaker 0: Well, a lot of people don't know all the oeuvre.

186
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:04,100
Speaker 1: Oh no, but I remember there were a few people... There was a conversation with some of the freshmen who had no idea who Daft Punk was at all.

187
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:09,680
Speaker 0: Sure, but if you play one more time, people largely know what song that is.

188
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:12,095
Speaker 1: Or they're like, "Oh, yeah, it's that song.

189
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:12,578
Speaker 1: I've heard that

190
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:12,840
Speaker 1: song.".

191
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,776
Speaker 0: They know that song, yeah.

192
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:29,619
Speaker 0: But also, culturally, the Daft Punk music was not only the music of the internet people, especially in the early 2000s.

193
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:40,280
Speaker 0: But also, the music that followed, almost all the music I listen to today, Daft Punk is the number one influence of that music.

194
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,225
Speaker 0: There is not a time... I can't even remember.

195
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:50,220
Speaker 0: I think there's some kind of secret DJ law that if you don't play at least one Daft Punk track in your set, you go to DJ jail.

196
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:58,000
Speaker 0: I cannot remember the last time I heard any DJ not play at least one Daft Punk song.

197
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:02,200
Speaker 0: And there's literally no other musical act you can say.

198
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:11,820
Speaker 1: I remember using, even in anime music nights at RIT, I used Interstellar 5555 as my excuse to play some Daft Punk when I was supposed to be playing like anime openers.

199
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:27,120
Speaker 0: The deal that they were, and the aesthetic that they had especially, not just the music itself, was just pretty much right in the nerd wheelhouse.

200
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,126
Speaker 0: So, they ended, right?

201
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:34,552
Speaker 0: There's no more Daft Punk, right?

202
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:37,519
Speaker 0: They already haven't released anything, really, since the Tron OST.

203
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:43,520
Speaker 0: And really, before that, Random Access Memories is really the last Daft Punk thing.

204
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,468
Speaker 0: They haven't done anything.

205
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,840
Speaker 0: They've collaborated on a few tracks with other people.

206
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,201
Speaker 1: And you know what?

207
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:48,663
Speaker 1: They didn't have to.

208
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:49,526
Speaker 1: They made their mark.

209
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:53,300
Speaker 1: I will never fault anyone who retires with their millions.

210
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,789
Speaker 0: I had infinite patience, right?

211
00:12:56,849 --> 00:12:59,799
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Listen, you can't put anything out unless you top what you already

212
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,060
Speaker 0: did.".

213
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,927
Speaker 0: And that's basically an impossible task.

214
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:05,160
Speaker 0: I basically had no expectation they would ever do anything again.

215
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,919
Speaker 0: And if they were going to do something again, I was willing to wait until I was like an old man.

216
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:12,775
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Take as long as you want, French

217
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:13,179
Speaker 0: dudes.".

218
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:18,035
Speaker 0: And yeah, so they officially said they're done, which is basically,

219
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:18,658
Speaker 0: "Huh.".

220
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,540
Speaker 0: I mean, my personal reaction is, "Huh," because I wasn't expecting you'd ever release anything anyway.

221
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,435
Speaker 0: Being officially done is no big deal, right?

222
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:27,400
Speaker 0: What difference does it make?

223
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,481
Speaker 0: Nope.

224
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:30,947
Speaker 1: But it is sort of an end of an era.

225
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:34,956
Speaker 1: It ends that speculation of the occasional thought of, "I wonder what Daft Punk are up to.

226
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:35,397
Speaker 1: Nothing?

227
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:35,717
Speaker 1: Oh,

228
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,179
Speaker 1: okay.".

229
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:43,240
Speaker 0: I think it has, though, in a way, by ending it, they are sort of reviving.

230
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,440
Speaker 0: It's like suddenly, whether people know them or not, there's now a big boom in interest in them that they've ended.

231
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:57,880
Speaker 1: After I heard the news, I just put on basically just a playlist of every album in chronological order.

232
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,943
Speaker 0: I would love to see.

233
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:02,515
Speaker 0: I should go check the Google Trends graph.

234
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:03,880
Speaker 0: I wish you could get that for Spotify.

235
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,638
Speaker 0: You could probably see, like, around the world.

236
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:09,520
Speaker 1: God damn harder, better, faster, stronger, like that fucking song.

237
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,980
Speaker 0: Pun intended, around the world you would see this big spike of Daft Punk listens.

238
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,220
Speaker 0: They probably made a ton of money by ending it, because there's so many streams.

239
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:23,224
Speaker 0: I don't expect.

240
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:28,140
Speaker 0: I said this on the internet in all the different places, but I don't expect them to come back.

241
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,626
Speaker 0: I don't demand.

242
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,700
Speaker 0: I hope, obviously, that they come back and do something else.

243
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,618
Speaker 1: I hope for a lot of things.

244
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,280
Speaker 0: I have no expectation whatsoever.

245
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:41,160
Speaker 0: And I, in fact, think the odds of them doing anything else from here on out are very, very low.

246
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,279
Speaker 0: I would never bet that you're going to hear more from them ever.

247
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:49,219
Speaker 0: But a tiny piece of me is saying, you know what?

248
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:53,111
Speaker 0: What they're doing here is like, look, they ended.

249
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:55,240
Speaker 0: That gets you publicity.

250
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:56,270
Speaker 0: They know that.

251
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,040
Speaker 0: They're not stupid.

252
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:00,488
Speaker 0: People always search for the celebrity.

253
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:03,580
Speaker 0: after they die, the obituary comes out, the prices go up.

254
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,249
Speaker 0: They know that.

255
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:04,900
Speaker 0: They're not stupid.

256
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:14,840
Speaker 0: This could be a ploy, a marketing ploy, where you end it, and then you come back as something new.

257
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,049
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, Daft Punk is over.

258
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:18,659
Speaker 0: We're now something else.

259
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:25,780
Speaker 0: New branding, new thing, new kind of music, who knows?

260
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:26,958
Speaker 0: Might even be music.

261
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,508
Speaker 0: And that's the move.

262
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:32,613
Speaker 0: That's a move they could make.

263
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:34,040
Speaker 0: I'm not betting on that move.

264
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:36,432
Speaker 0: I'm not predicting that move.

265
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:37,720
Speaker 0: I'm not expecting that move.

266
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,160
Speaker 0: But if that move happens, just because I think that is such a good move.

267
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,059
Speaker 0: You'll hear Scott on Geek Nuts saying, "I fucking told you

268
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:44,140
Speaker 0: all."

269
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,182
Speaker 0: That's right.

270
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:50,512
Speaker 0: Because I thought of that move, I just want to make sure that on the 0.001% chance that happens, I called it.

271
00:15:56,821 --> 00:16:01,996
Speaker 1: So in some gaming news, it's already at almost a million dollars.

272
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:03,260
Speaker 1: It started today.

273
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,872
Speaker 1: The root Kickstarter for the next expansion, the Marauder expansion, is literally $852,000 and 10,000 backers as of when we talked about this.

274
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,349
Speaker 1: I think it was at about $400,000 when I backed it.

275
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:22,180
Speaker 1: This is the next expansion to root.

276
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:25,060
Speaker 0: The final, final, final expansion?

277
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,479
Speaker 1: I mean, final, final, final, dot, A, V, I, pren, one, close, pren.

278
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,175
Speaker 0: Root is going to disband after this?

279
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:32,740
Speaker 0: Like Daft Punk?

280
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,699
Speaker 1: The next faction is Daft Punk.

281
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:36,897
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

282
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,512
Speaker 1: But this expansion is interesting.

283
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:42,560
Speaker 1: They're all interesting.

284
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,400
Speaker 1: It sucks because they're not getting a lot of play because the online implementation by Direwolf, which is fantastic, still only has the base game.

285
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:56,540
Speaker 1: Like, I would pay a lot of money if it could somehow get them to start implementing these expansions faster online.

286
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,640
Speaker 0: The digital root is the, you know, as much as I enjoy root, all the roots, the digital root is the only root I'm personally going to own.

287
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,579
Speaker 0: Because if I'm going to play it, I'm always going to be playing it with someone else who owns all the expansions.

288
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,599
Speaker 0: And I own all the expansions.

289
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,119
Speaker 0: Right, so what do I need to own it for?

290
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,060
Speaker 0: So do Judith and Natalie.

291
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,769
Speaker 0: I got, I'm with Oath.

292
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,755
Speaker 0: Oath is coming for me.

293
00:17:14,795 --> 00:17:15,500
Speaker 0: I'll be the Oath guy.

294
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,454
Speaker 1: You can be the Oath guy because, same, I need to play Oath but I got to play it with someone else.

295
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:20,579
Speaker 1: You can be Oath and I'll kill the Oath.

296
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:22,032
Speaker 0: Oath is, I already Kickstarted it.

297
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:22,660
Speaker 0: It's on its way.

298
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,438
Speaker 1: Keeper of the Oath.

299
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,000
Speaker 0: It's not, I guess it's eventually on its way.

300
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,140
Speaker 1: They've added two new factions that look really fun.

301
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:38,400
Speaker 1: They've also added a bunch of basically like hirelings or like mini factions that can fill the board with stuff to interact with.

302
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,540
Speaker 1: Like the river folk flotilla or some profits that you can use to sort of mess with the board while you're playing.

303
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,000
Speaker 1: Like add some spice to the game if you're starting to get stale on some of the factions you've already played and know and love.

304
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,033
Speaker 1: They also gave us a use for that bear token.

305
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,399
Speaker 1: that was in the original game.

306
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:57,591
Speaker 0: Yeah.

307
00:17:58,401 --> 00:17:59,700
Speaker 1: He is the outcast.

308
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,800
Speaker 1: The only thing I'm not super interested in is they're also adding mechanized versions of a bunch more factions.

309
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:17,880
Speaker 1: For if you want to play the game physically but don't have enough people to play the game and you want like a paper AI to run the otters or the lizards or something.

310
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,949
Speaker 0: Listen, I empathize with that, right?

311
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,640
Speaker 0: When I was a kid I had Axis and Allies, right?

312
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:32,680
Speaker 0: It's like I was a nerd who wanted to play board games like a battle tech and I didn't play those until pretty, I mean barely played them until I brought them to RIT where they were nerds, right?

313
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:42,040
Speaker 0: So I feel for those nerds who love board games, have board games, they just want to play roots so damn bad and they just don't have people to play it with, right?

314
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:48,240
Speaker 1: How many times I read the D&D rules, Cyclopedia, before I could get a game going?

315
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,282
Speaker 0: Exactly.

316
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:53,599
Speaker 0: Even if they're not that guy, they just don't have people where they are, right?

317
00:18:55,721 --> 00:19:08,220
Speaker 0: And so that is making the trend, it's an increasing trend definitely of solo playable games with some sort of clockwork or whatever mechanism for simulating another player.

318
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,660
Speaker 0: Whereas if you were playing digitally, like Digital Carcassonne, Digital Race to the Galaxy, just have AI players, you don't need that, right?

319
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:27,660
Speaker 0: But physical board games, I support that, but also even in the COVID times, you think I would finally need that and I almost considered maybe, but now I have people to play with.

320
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:31,277
Speaker 0: I don't personally need that so I have no interest in them for myself.

321
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,500
Speaker 1: But the cool thing is, the way the Kickstarter is structured, you can back everything but that if you want.

322
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:46,040
Speaker 0: It's good on them for recognizing that some people have people to play with and why should they spend money on that part they're never going to use.

323
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:52,180
Speaker 1: I feel like at some point we'll talk about that concept, like the paper AIs, that could easily be a Holy Geek Nights episode.

324
00:19:52,940 --> 00:20:00,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the problem is we just haven't, since we have no personal need or interest in them, we haven't played any so we have to play a bunch of them to be able to discuss them.

325
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:09,880
Speaker 1: What I have the most experience with is not actually a player, but it's the mechanisms of India in John Company version 1.

326
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's not acting as a player.

327
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:18,320
Speaker 1: No, but it's a very similar, like here is a system that acts like an AI using physical components.

328
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, sort of.

329
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,420
Speaker 1: In some other news, The Legend of Zelda had a pretty terrifying anniversary.

330
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:33,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this is the 35th anniversary of Zelda 1, The Legend of Zelda, which came out in 1986.

331
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:45,580
Speaker 0: And I learned something about The Legend of Zelda that I didn't know, thanks to, I think I'm pronouncing the last name correctly, there's this person, Frank Cifaldi, who I follow on Twitter, very popular, basically an expert in game preservation.

332
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:57,920
Speaker 0: And Frank mentioned that like, yeah, there is no way to play the original Legend of Zelda with the English dialogue text, right?

333
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:07,039
Speaker 0: You know, the English text obviously is broken in many ways, but with the English translation and also the original audio as was intended.

334
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,983
Speaker 0: And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

335
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:17,100
Speaker 0: Like I knew that Castlevania 3, the NES cartridge in Japan, the Famicom cartridge had a different sound chip in it.

336
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:25,798
Speaker 0: And that's why the sound on Castlevania 3 Japanese version versus US version is drastically different and the US one is drastically inferior.

337
00:21:25,878 --> 00:21:26,680
Speaker 0: I knew that already.

338
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,869
Speaker 0: Why would Legend of Zelda have different audio?

339
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:36,780
Speaker 0: I knew that in Japan, Legend of Zelda was a Famicom Disk System game.

340
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the key, the Disk System.

341
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:52,020
Speaker 0: I didn't know, I did not know before just the other day, or if I did know, I forgot, that the Famicom Disk System actually has its own audio hardware.

342
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,363
Speaker 0: Obviously it's taking disks, right?

343
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:56,312
Speaker 0: There can't be any audio chips in a floppy disk.

344
00:21:57,877 --> 00:21:58,839
Speaker 0: They have to be in the FDS.

345
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:10,660
Speaker 0: And so yeah, the original Legend of Zelda in Japan, the music, all the sounds were significantly different from the ones we heard on our NES cartridge.

346
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,090
Speaker 0: Our life has been a lie.

347
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,580
Speaker 0: This is bullshit.

348
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,252
Speaker 1: Well, it's interesting because I think they're both good for different reasons.

349
00:22:20,332 --> 00:22:23,680
Speaker 1: Like the one on the NES sounds cleaner.

350
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,480
Speaker 0: I'm not saying one's good or bad, I'm saying that one is the true one and one is a pretender.

351
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:38,200
Speaker 0: But also one can argue- A pretender can be, you can have a pretender to the throne who's a better king than the legit king, but only one of them is the son of the previous king and the other one isn't.

352
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,332
Speaker 1: But there's also the idea that you recreate the music based on the chip you're using.

353
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:46,120
Speaker 1: Like you want to talk about sound problems, look at old DOS games.

354
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,571
Speaker 1: Whatever MIDI font you had in your sound card is what all your video games sounded like.

355
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:58,000
Speaker 1: If you had a better sound card, games just sounded better, usually.

356
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,400
Speaker 0: We all know that Sound Blaster 16 is the true sound, everything else is bullshit.

357
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,733
Speaker 1: Well, the Sound Blaster 16 with the AWE32, which had way better MIDI.

358
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,711
Speaker 0: But so many DOS games were not used in the AWE32.

359
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:11,258
Speaker 0: They came out before the AWE32 existed.

360
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,699
Speaker 1: I realize they did use it because a lot of that sound was just MIDI and it would use whatever sound font was in your sound card.

361
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:27,400
Speaker 0: But what I'm saying is that those games were made, the people developing those games had Sound Blaster 16 cards that did not have the AWE32 which came much later.

362
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,760
Speaker 1: You don't know, they might have had libcards in the development boxes.

363
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,860
Speaker 0: I'm sure they did probably have them to test with because those were always an option.

364
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,059
Speaker 1: But even with Sound Blaster 16, depending on your sound card, you could just load different sounds into your MIDI banks.

365
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,960
Speaker 1: I'm oversimplifying because none of you give a shit about how MIDI works anymore.

366
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:47,399
Speaker 0: You could though.

367
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:57,158
Speaker 1: Basically, if you had an AWE32, like, Tie Fighter just sounded infinitely better because the trumpets were better samples.

368
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:57,980
Speaker 1: Full stop.

369
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:07,040
Speaker 1: But yeah, I guess what stands out to me is that the samples sound worse on the Famicom Disk System but are also more realistic.

370
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,500
Speaker 1: I feel like they simplified the samples that were used.

371
00:24:12,941 --> 00:24:20,520
Speaker 1: The sound sounds more digital and square wave, sawtooth wave on the NES, but you hear more samples on the FTS.

372
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,486
Speaker 1: Like that gong sound.

373
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:25,480
Speaker 1: I want to see what part of that chip they used to make that gong sound.

374
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know the actual specific details.

375
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,832
Speaker 1: I don't know fuck all about the Famicom Disk System sounds.

376
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:32,340
Speaker 1: I have no idea if those are samples or not.

377
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,713
Speaker 0: It's definitely mind-bending to hear the original and be like, "What the fuck?

378
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:38,618
Speaker 0: The one that I know in my brain is not the

379
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:39,040
Speaker 0: original.".

380
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,618
Speaker 0: That's how the song is supposed to be.

381
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,809
Speaker 1: The difference that stands out the most are the bells.

382
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,960
Speaker 0: Like, there's these bells playing and honestly, I like it.

383
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,220
Speaker 0: There must be, like I said, I don't know the details, but it feels, just listening to it, it feels like they must have additional tracks.

384
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:57,480
Speaker 0: And they're definitely playing the bells on a track that the NES doesn't have.

385
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,370
Speaker 1: Well, because remember the NES has four tracks.

386
00:25:00,014 --> 00:25:00,980
Speaker 1: We've talked about this before.

387
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:10,860
Speaker 1: Anyway, I have never heard, to my knowledge, a modern arrangement of the Zelda theme that has the bells from the FTS.

388
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:16,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've heard plenty of arrangements from orchestras and the orchestras always sound like the NES version.

389
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:26,840
Speaker 0: Why aren't those orchestras arranging the original version?

390
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,707
Speaker 1: Because I like the bells.

391
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:29,140
Speaker 1: The bells add this very epic feeling.

392
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,695
Speaker 0: If you hear an orchestra in Japan play it, are they going to play the Famicom version?

393
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:33,740
Speaker 0: The FTS version?

394
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:43,480
Speaker 1: From what I gather, more people ended up playing the later release of The Legend of Zelda, but I don't have anything to go on except some old websites for that.

395
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:53,740
Speaker 0: And then when Nintendo re-released the game on various ROMs and such, at least in the US, I have the GameCube disc that has the game on it.

396
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:01,300
Speaker 0: And I've played it on the Wii on the Virtual Console, and you can play it on your Switch in the NES app.

397
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,028
Speaker 0: And all of those have the NES music.

398
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:07,380
Speaker 0: They don't have the Famicom music or even have the option to do it.

399
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:14,820
Speaker 1: Even if someone just recorded an orchestra playing the song for some future remake, I bet they wouldn't have those bells.

400
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,140
Speaker 0: Anyway.

401
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,740
Speaker 1: Anyway, in some other news, Civilization VI, which we've been playing multiplayer a lot lately.

402
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,560
Speaker 1: Literally, we were playing a live game and bitching at each other about the barbarians because we were all having barbarian problems.

403
00:26:30,902 --> 00:26:34,258
Speaker 1: And we even were piding like, "You know, I wish they'd make the barbarians more

404
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:34,560
Speaker 1: interesting.".

405
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,740
Speaker 1: Literally, the next day, this update comes, Civ VI is making the barbarians more interesting.

406
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:41,782
Speaker 0: Yep.

407
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:42,520
Speaker 0: Sounds good.

408
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,640
Speaker 0: This is real exciting.

409
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:53,179
Speaker 0: Considering that when we play Civ VI, it's like I complain about a lot of things, but something everyone complains about is the barbarians.

410
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,756
Speaker 0: Every time we play, the first 20 minutes, it's just like, "Oh my god,

411
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:00,438
Speaker 0: barbarians!".

412
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,864
Speaker 1: Well, it's usually first.

413
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:04,154
Speaker 1: Scott is like, "How are there already barbarians here?

414
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:05,118
Speaker 1: Does anyone else see this

415
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:05,319
Speaker 1: shit?".

416
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,435
Speaker 1: Two rounds later, Alex will be like, "Also, why are there no huts?

417
00:27:08,556 --> 00:27:08,817
Speaker 1: I want

418
00:27:08,857 --> 00:27:09,078
Speaker 1: huts.".

419
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,514
Speaker 1: The barbarians have horse archers somehow.

420
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:12,300
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

421
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:13,715
Speaker 0: Yeah.

422
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:14,020
Speaker 0: Exactly.

423
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,344
Speaker 1: I feel like complaining about the barbarians.

424
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:22,580
Speaker 1: in multiplayer Civ is expected in the same way that complaining about your hand in a trick-taking game is expected.

425
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:22,848
Speaker 1: Exactly.

426
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,159
Speaker 1: You're playing the game partly to bitch about that thing.

427
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,419
Speaker 0: It's definitely the same vibes.

428
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,660
Speaker 1: But the update is actually really fascinating, and you can watch this video that will tell you all the details.

429
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,800
Speaker 1: But basically, the barbarians will be parts of separate clans, and you don't have to destroy them.

430
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,189
Speaker 1: You can basically help them or hinder them.

431
00:27:41,651 --> 00:27:43,840
Speaker 1: If you help them, they eventually become a city-state.

432
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:47,200
Speaker 1: And if you hinder them, you can destroy them in war with them like normal.

433
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,739
Speaker 1: But you can also do stuff like pay them to go attack someone else.

434
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:52,239
Speaker 0: That's what I want.

435
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,158
Speaker 1: Pay them to buy back your settler.

436
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:02,798
Speaker 0: Lately, before this expansion hits, what I've been doing more recently is like, "You know what?

437
00:28:02,818 --> 00:28:03,199
Speaker 0: Screw it.

438
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,920
Speaker 0: If barbarians are a thing, I'm just going to build extra warriors, and I'm going to treat the barbarians...".

439
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,597
Speaker 0: I've been treating the barbarians not as an annoying thing, like, "Go away.

440
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:13,240
Speaker 0: You're bothering

441
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:13,320
Speaker 0: me.".

442
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:22,360
Speaker 0: But as barbarians, that means you have a camp full of gold that I will take with my extra warriors, and the money I get makes up for the extra warriors I build.

443
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,580
Speaker 1: Oh, and our current game, I'm Gorgos, so I'm farming both culture and gold right now.

444
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, I try to farm the barbarian camps on purpose.

445
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,154
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Here's my squad of dudes.

446
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:34,040
Speaker 0: I got like two warriors and a slinger.

447
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,351
Speaker 0: Where are the barbarian camps?

448
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:35,937
Speaker 0: I'm coming to get

449
00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:36,058
Speaker 0: you.".

450
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:41,699
Speaker 1: But now the barbarian camps have their own health, and you can fight with them, and you can either just raid them for money or try to destroy them.

451
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,010
Speaker 0: Oh, they don't just die in one.

452
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,080
Speaker 0: You can't just walk on them.

453
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,116
Speaker 1: I think you've got to actually fight them.

454
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:46,214
Speaker 0: Boo.

455
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:48,339
Speaker 1: We'll see exactly how this shakes down.

456
00:28:48,744 --> 00:28:50,080
Speaker 1: Because I haven't seen it yet.

457
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,159
Speaker 0: There goes my money-making scheme.

458
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,540
Speaker 1: Because I know you can raid them and not destroy them.

459
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,142
Speaker 0: What sucks is?

460
00:28:56,162 --> 00:29:01,720
Speaker 0: we just started a cloud game pretty recently, and it's like, do we restart it when it's still early?

461
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:02,202
Speaker 1: No.

462
00:29:02,546 --> 00:29:03,960
Speaker 1: We'll just make another cloud game.

463
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:05,099
Speaker 1: Oh, great.

464
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,297
Speaker 1: We'll play a live game with them.

465
00:29:07,611 --> 00:29:07,800
Speaker 0: Sure.

466
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:19,420
Speaker 1: But the coolest thing about them is that whatever civs are in the game, each barbarian clan will have units from random civilizations that are not in the game.

467
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,460
Speaker 1: So, like, the unique unit from, I don't know, England.

468
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,040
Speaker 1: Like, the barbarians might just have that unit if no player is playing England.

469
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:29,164
Speaker 1: Mmm.

470
00:29:29,721 --> 00:29:32,320
Speaker 1: And you can pay the barbarians to get access to that unit.

471
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:36,660
Speaker 0: Ah, so, like, there's barbarians, but Rome is not in this game.

472
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,260
Speaker 0: Those might be Roman barbarians, and legions just come out.

473
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:39,697
Speaker 1: Yup.

474
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:41,719
Speaker 1: And I might decide, you know what, barbarians?

475
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:43,340
Speaker 1: You're between me and Scott.

476
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:48,480
Speaker 1: I'm going to help you out so you become a city state, and then I can, like, get you the normal way.

477
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,099
Speaker 1: And also, I'm going to pay you to go fuck with Scott, and I'm going to buy legions from you.

478
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:59,280
Speaker 0: Or you see a barbarian camp, and it's getting to, like, the Renaissance, and they still haven't produced a special unit.

479
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:03,180
Speaker 0: And you're like, oh, I wonder what special unit they're going to make.

480
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,759
Speaker 0: Give me some janissaries.

481
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:07,099
Speaker 0: It must be a late game one.

482
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,079
Speaker 1: Musketeers, barbarians with an aircraft carrier.

483
00:30:10,903 --> 00:30:15,820
Speaker 0: Or the one they make is, like, the earliest game one, like a special warrior from someone.

484
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,534
Speaker 0: And you're like, well, these barbarians are about to become useless.

485
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:19,579
Speaker 0: Let's just get rid of them.

486
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:22,357
Speaker 0: Right after those warriors stop being useful.

487
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:22,740
Speaker 0: Goodbye.

488
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,160
Speaker 1: I appreciate that they continue to invest in, like, all this fun stuff for civilization.

489
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,680
Speaker 1: Because also, this update does not cost anything.

490
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,640
Speaker 1: Everyone gets it, even if you didn't buy any of these other updates.

491
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:38,432
Speaker 0: Oh, very nice.

492
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:39,340
Speaker 0: Very nice.

493
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:46,300
Speaker 1: I feel like COVID times have made civilization have a little bit of an uptick, and I think they're reacting to that.

494
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,556
Speaker 0: They must have gotten good sales on their whatever pack.

495
00:30:49,596 --> 00:30:50,239
Speaker 0: I mean, I bought it.

496
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:50,736
Speaker 0: I bought it.

497
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,840
Speaker 0: So, the sales must have been good on that, and that's allowing them to, you know, keep going.

498
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:04,340
Speaker 1: They're also clearly spying on us based on what they keep adding, so if you're spying on us now, just make it easy to turn a real, a live game into a cloud game.

499
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,418
Speaker 1: Like, come on.

500
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:12,096
Speaker 0: Fix your networked asynchronous play to make it elegant and not broken.

501
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,640
Speaker 0: That should be the number one thing.

502
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,980
Speaker 1: I would pay 50 bucks if you released an update package that literally just made cloud play work.

503
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,420
Speaker 0: You must know that the app Play Your Damn Turn exists and does a better job.

504
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,746
Speaker 0: You're being paid.

505
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:25,631
Speaker 0: They're not.

506
00:31:25,731 --> 00:31:27,239
Speaker 0: You should be able to do better than them.

507
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,759
Speaker 0: And also, you should just buy them, and that way you can port everyone's Play Your Damn Turn games over.

508
00:31:33,722 --> 00:31:34,938
Speaker 0: And GMR games also, right?

509
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:38,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, but just hire the people who were, who made Play Your Damn Turn.

510
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,620
Speaker 0: Exactly.

511
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,703
Speaker 1: Some other news.

512
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,280
Speaker 1: There's another Kickstarter we can talk about.

513
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:46,815
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, there is one more thing.

514
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:47,139
Speaker 0: You're right.

515
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,700
Speaker 1: ZineQuest with a really, really good logo.

516
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:59,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, so ZineQuest is a thing that's been happening at Kickstarter for a few years now, where basically, it's just, I don't know if it's always in February.

517
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:02,208
Speaker 0: I just remember it happening every once in a while.

518
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:04,053
Speaker 0: This is already the third time it's happened.

519
00:32:04,093 --> 00:32:06,340
Speaker 0: It feels like only the second time.

520
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,591
Speaker 0: But anyway, the idea is that Kickstarter goes like, "Hey, it's ZineQuest time.

521
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:14,297
Speaker 0: Everyone, make RPG zines.

522
00:32:14,358 --> 00:32:14,839
Speaker 0: Now is the

523
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:15,280
Speaker 0: time.".

524
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:22,180
Speaker 0: And they basically encourage people to make little zines at this time as part of this project, right?

525
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,260
Speaker 0: So that Kickstarter gets flooded with the same kind of thing all at once.

526
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:29,107
Speaker 0: And also encourages people to make a zine.

527
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:34,100
Speaker 0: Like, normally, some people sitting at home, RPG people, maybe they weren't gonna make a zine.

528
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,642
Speaker 0: But you know what?

529
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:36,608
Speaker 0: It's sort of like NaNoWriMo.

530
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,952
Speaker 0: It's like, "It's ZineQuest time.

531
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:39,216
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I better make a

532
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:39,617
Speaker 0: zine.".

533
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:46,231
Speaker 0: And I can tell you that there are this ZineQuest, ZineQuest 3.

534
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:50,479
Speaker 0: I mean, if you've got an idea for a zine, you can still go for it.

535
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:51,140
Speaker 0: It's not too late.

536
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,763
Speaker 0: I saw some go live yesterday.

537
00:32:54,206 --> 00:33:01,120
Speaker 0: But if you're into buying some zines, this is maybe the best batch of zines I've ever seen of all three zine quests.

538
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,954
Speaker 0: And I've purchased and Kickstarted zines from all three quests so far.

539
00:33:06,975 --> 00:33:08,760
Speaker 0: I checked my history there.

540
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:18,460
Speaker 1: We're definitely having this sort of surging, not really a renaissance, but we're entering this pre-golden age of tabletop RPGs in general.

541
00:33:19,702 --> 00:33:31,960
Speaker 0: So if you are interested in playing some indie RPG or making some, you just wanna sort of make a quickie, a little fast and loose one, ZineQuest is for you.

542
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,260
Speaker 0: And might I note, it would take me too long to mention all of them that are worth mentioning.

543
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:44,760
Speaker 0: But the one I wanna note is we did a Geek Nights episode, I believe, on the Wizard's Grimoire.

544
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,433
Speaker 0: The Wizard's Grimoire is being done, redone, as a zine, as part of the ZineQuest.

545
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:54,380
Speaker 0: I think it just went up very recently.

546
00:33:55,121 --> 00:34:05,675
Speaker 0: And the rules have been redone a bit with the dice pool system that will make it easier to unlock the secrets that lie within.

547
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:08,839
Speaker 0: So get on that.

548
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:17,958
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

549
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,770
Speaker 1: So this looks pretty legit, like I'm confident this really happened.

550
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,933
Speaker 1: And it's super cool.

551
00:34:25,456 --> 00:34:29,386
Speaker 1: All I have to do is read the headline and you'll know exactly what this is, like.

552
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:31,170
Speaker 1: I don't need to say anything else at all.

553
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:40,110
Speaker 1: But if you do click on my thing of the day, the entire story, the journey of creating this thing, like everything, is explained.

554
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:43,373
Speaker 1: There are more pictures than you can imagine, like it is perfect.

555
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:54,168
Speaker 1: So the headline of this thing of the day is, and I quote, "This dude built a guitar out of his dead uncle's

556
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:55,050
Speaker 1: skeleton.".

557
00:34:56,952 --> 00:34:59,930
Speaker 0: It's a totally real thing, as far as I can tell.

558
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,709
Speaker 1: This is amazing, and I hope someone makes a musical instrument.

559
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,370
Speaker 0: You would think it might be horrifying, but no, in this case, it's okay.

560
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,662
Speaker 1: Yep, it is 100% okay.

561
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:12,390
Speaker 0: This is an okay scenario, given the facts, at least in my opinion.

562
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:15,690
Speaker 0: I'm sure someone out there thinks it's not okay.

563
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,644
Speaker 1: There are definitely ways this story could have gone.

564
00:35:18,664 --> 00:35:19,850
Speaker 1: that would have not been okay.

565
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,830
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, many.

566
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,850
Speaker 1: It could have gone in an E&M Banks direction.

567
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,256
Speaker 0: Many directions.

568
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,167
Speaker 0: But no, it's good.

569
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:28,730
Speaker 0: It's all cool.

570
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:31,810
Speaker 1: I hope someone makes a musical instrument out of my skeleton.

571
00:35:32,752 --> 00:35:33,329
Speaker 0: That would be awesome.

572
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:34,601
Speaker 1: After I am dead.

573
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:35,330
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

574
00:35:37,371 --> 00:36:00,038
Speaker 0: So, in line with our Zelda 1 news, I have learned recently that the Super Nintendo, we all know that in the Super Nintendo, there were certain chips that could be in cartridges, most famously FX chip, and that would let you make a Super Nintendo game that was more powerful, more fancier than some other chips.

575
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:12,610
Speaker 0: So that's why, for example, a game like Super Metroid had a lot more advanced stuff in it than some other cartridges of simpler games.

576
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:18,190
Speaker 0: When you're making cartridge games, you want to put as few chips in the cartridge as you can, save money, make the game cheaper.

577
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:36,670
Speaker 0: So there was this game called Race Driven, which was the sequel to another game called Race Something, I forget, and that was an arcade game that was then ported to an Atari computer, like the Atari something, not like a 2600, like one of the computer ones.

578
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,410
Speaker 1: It looks a lot like Stumps 4D Racing, like that kind of game.

579
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,555
Speaker 0: Yeah.

580
00:36:40,736 --> 00:36:42,910
Speaker 0: And then it also got an SNES port.

581
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:53,387
Speaker 0: The SNES port of Race Driven, and I believe possibly all the ports, and also maybe even the original Race Driven, ran at a smooth 4 FPS.

582
00:36:54,892 --> 00:36:59,927
Speaker 0: It was not a pleasant experience, this game.

583
00:37:00,308 --> 00:37:00,990
Speaker 0: It was not great.

584
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:10,150
Speaker 0: However, there was a chip that you could get in a Super Nintendo cartridge called the SA-1, the Super Accelerator 1.

585
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:16,770
Speaker 0: It was used in, according to Wikipedia, 34 different SNES games used it, including Mario RPG.

586
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:36,430
Speaker 0: So this is a real thing that worked in a real SNES, but obviously the SA-1 Super Accelerator chip that had the chip itself in the cartridge had 10.74 MHz clock speed, the chip in the Super Nintendo had like a 4 MHz clock speed, right?

587
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:43,730
Speaker 0: So you could really make a fancy game if you put this chip into your Super Nintendo cartridge.

588
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:56,910
Speaker 0: So there's a Brazilian, it even says, they're even mentioned on Wikipedia, even though my thing of the day is this YouTube video from their YouTube channel, this person has a Wikipedia mentioned under the SA-1 chip listing.

589
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:13,270
Speaker 0: Brazilian ROM hacker Vitor Vilela, I hope I pronounced your name correctly, Vitor, has created ROM patches for Contra 3, Gradius 3, Mario World Super R-Type, and Race Driven.

590
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:18,990
Speaker 0: All of these games are games that are notoriously laggy on a Super Nintendo.

591
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:25,470
Speaker 0: If you've played any of them, you know these are laggy games in certain scenarios, or perhaps, like Race Driven, always.

592
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:40,090
Speaker 0: But if those cartridges had SA-1 chips in them, which they don't, but if they did, you could have programmed those games in such a way to not be laggy, right?

593
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:45,130
Speaker 1: And in an emulator, you could just tell to get the ROM as soon as this chip is there.

594
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,532
Speaker 0: Exactly!

595
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:57,090
Speaker 0: If you're using an emulator, or even just one of those flash cartridges you put into a Super Nintendo, and then load ROMs into, that chip is effectively always there.

596
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:03,503
Speaker 0: You just have to write the ROM to look for it and to tell the emulator that, "Yes, I'm a cartridge with that chip,

597
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:04,148
Speaker 0: yes!".

598
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:18,690
Speaker 0: So this ROM hacker in Brazil basically hacked these ROMs and changed them and recoded them as if those games were delivered on cartridges that had this chip to remove the lag from them.

599
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:30,428
Speaker 0: And in the YouTube video, that is my thing of the day, you will see a side-by-side, the original Super Nintendo Race Driven on the left, running at 4 FPS, and the Race Driven running on the right, running at full FPS.

600
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:39,884
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Damn, I really want to go get this Gradius ROM hack that is basically just Gradius with no lag, because the lag really ruins that game big

601
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:40,287
Speaker 0: time.".

602
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:43,219
Speaker 0: And that should be a pleasure to play.

603
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:45,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is great stuff.

604
00:39:45,891 --> 00:39:48,230
Speaker 0: I would love to see some more of this action, right?

605
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,969
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, nothing's new!

606
00:39:52,173 --> 00:39:53,010
Speaker 1: Follow us on the internet.

607
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:55,368
Speaker 0: Pretty much, yeah.

608
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:56,882
Speaker 1: Let's get right into it.

609
00:39:56,923 --> 00:39:57,064
Speaker 1: We...

610
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,690
Speaker 0: We got no meta.

611
00:39:58,874 --> 00:39:59,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got no meta.

612
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:03,004
Speaker 1: So I've played enough of this game to talk about it.

613
00:40:03,044 --> 00:40:04,109
Speaker 1: Scott's played a bit more than me.

614
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:10,310
Speaker 0: I beat this game and I started a new game plus, but did not finish my new game plus.

615
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,009
Speaker 0: I only got a little bit of the ways into that.

616
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,570
Speaker 1: I like this game a lot, so it's on Steam, Switch, PlayStation, like you can get it a million places.

617
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,970
Speaker 1: Heaven's Vault is an archaeology game.

618
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:20,809
Speaker 0: Not Heaven's Gate!

619
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:21,444
Speaker 1: Nope.

620
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,449
Speaker 0: Heaven's Gate is like a horrible cult, right?

621
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,530
Speaker 1: I feel like the listener might be a little too young to remember Heaven's Gate.

622
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:30,430
Speaker 0: Well, Heaven's Vault, don't get 'em confused.

623
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:34,770
Speaker 0: It's a vault where Al Capone keeps his nothing.

624
00:40:36,231 --> 00:40:39,930
Speaker 1: I feel like the listener is definitely too young to know what the fuck you're talking about there.

625
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:43,609
Speaker 0: I don't know any other vault references.

626
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,450
Speaker 1: Like, we're old enough to remember Geraldo Rivera's previous life.

627
00:40:49,852 --> 00:41:01,190
Speaker 1: Anyway, Heaven's Vault is a game where you play an archaeologist, and unlike, I think, every other game I have ever seen that involves an archaeologist, you actually do archaeology?

628
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:02,808
Speaker 0: Kind of.

629
00:41:03,032 --> 00:41:03,264
Speaker 0: Kinda?

630
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:08,710
Speaker 0: The game's pretty- As good as you can do in a video game where you can't literally do archaeology.

631
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:15,290
Speaker 1: I guess before we get into it, the thing to take away is that this game does some things that I have never seen done before.

632
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:16,426
Speaker 0: Nope.

633
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:20,610
Speaker 0: And- It does some things I have seen done before, but also many I have not.

634
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:31,950
Speaker 0: To the point that I struggle to name any game that's even remotely like it, and- The only game I can name that's remotely like it is a game I played a while back, which is Cloudpunk.

635
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,910
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

636
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:40,470
Speaker 0: And it's this genre of game that I describe as JR- Which is a game I've always wanted, which is JRPG with no combat, right?

637
00:41:41,631 --> 00:42:00,689
Speaker 0: There's sort of an overworld map that you walk around on, or in the case of Cloudpunk, you drive your hovercar around the Cyberpunk city, and in the case of Heaven's Vault, you fly your steampunk futures spaceship through the rivers of the space-time whatever it is.

638
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:02,370
Speaker 0: Nebula?

639
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,449
Speaker 0: Nebula, it's a nebula.

640
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,210
Speaker 0: You fly around the rivers of the nebula, visiting different locations, right?

641
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:11,970
Speaker 0: So that's the equivalent of like in Final Fantasy, where you're walking around the map going from town to town, right?

642
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:15,890
Speaker 0: And then when you get to a location, you do things there.

643
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,535
Speaker 0: You talk to people, right?

644
00:42:17,555 --> 00:42:22,810
Speaker 0: I guess you don't shop, or there's items and stuff you can get, right?

645
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,130
Speaker 0: Discoveries you can make, things to explore in the location.

646
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:31,330
Speaker 0: All the plot and stuff happens at the locations, but you're just traveling from location to location doing stuff.

647
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:35,150
Speaker 0: But no random encounters, no combat whatsoever, really.

648
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:41,890
Speaker 0: No like, not very much real-time or strategic winning losing gameplay.

649
00:42:43,051 --> 00:43:00,790
Speaker 0: It just comes down to like, plot and character dialogue and choose your own adventure stuff, and a little bit of puzzle-y, you know, sort of point-and-click adventure puzzle kind of stuff, but not the sort of tricky nonsense puzzles you get in a LucasArts world.

650
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,190
Speaker 0: Just like, you know, common sense stuff, right?

651
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,254
Speaker 0: Like, "Oh, what will you do?

652
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:07,970
Speaker 0: I'll put the thing in the thing where it makes sense for it to go.

653
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,883
Speaker 0: Do I give this to the person or don't

654
00:43:10,226 --> 00:43:10,246
Speaker 0: I?".

655
00:43:10,873 --> 00:43:11,810
Speaker 0: You know, that sort of stuff.

656
00:43:12,472 --> 00:43:41,058
Speaker 1: So, I guess before we get into what this game is like, a thing I'll point out is that when you start the game, you get a little intro, and then as soon as you're able to control your character, there's a menu you can open that shows you a timeline, and it shows the thing you just did, and it shows things from your past, and you can just scroll all the way back to effectively the beginning of time, and there's all these events from your life.

657
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:44,850
Speaker 1: Like, there's a lot of information in that thing already.

658
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:54,677
Speaker 0: Yep, and as you discover, first of all, as you do things in the game, the things you are doing are added to the timeline, so you can see what the hell did I do, right?

659
00:43:54,697 --> 00:44:01,930
Speaker 0: Because you can go back to the time on the timeline where the game started, and everything from that point to the right will be things you did.

660
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:13,070
Speaker 1: But also, to the left, if you learn things about the world, like, "Oh, this thing happened on this date," then it appears in the back of the timeline in that spot.

661
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:26,399
Speaker 0: Yep, so if you discover that 2,000 years ago, the ancient civilization or the ancient king/emperor died or something, you'll see exactly when that was on the timeline.

662
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:29,510
Speaker 0: once you learn it and you find out that it's true from your research.

663
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:32,038
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's way too much to read.

664
00:44:32,259 --> 00:44:35,630
Speaker 1: You're not expected to play this game and try to read that whole thing.

665
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,569
Speaker 0: But you reference it when you need to.

666
00:44:37,870 --> 00:45:00,387
Speaker 1: Yep, but basically, while you're playing, the game acts like you already know all this stuff, but it uses all of it as appropriate context, and as you learn things about the game and the world by playing it, some of those things start to make more sense or be seen in a different light, and there's a lot of discovery of the true nature of things over the course of this game.

667
00:45:00,427 --> 00:45:01,310
Speaker 1: I'm being vague on purpose.

668
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:07,550
Speaker 0: When I played the game, at the start, I read the whole timeline, because there wasn't much in there, just to get all the info.

669
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:13,709
Speaker 0: And then, at the end of the game, when I knew I was at the end of the game, I was at, spoilers, the heavens vaults, right?

670
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:20,110
Speaker 0: I read the whole damn thing to see all the stuff, to get the big picture.

671
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:27,131
Speaker 0: And then, throughout the game, in between there, I only referenced it a few times here and there when I had questions about things, like, "Wait,

672
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:27,432
Speaker 0: what?".

673
00:45:27,532 --> 00:45:30,601
Speaker 0: And that was like, you need to correct my knowledge about the story.

674
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:33,930
Speaker 0: I would go in there and find what happened and when.

675
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,192
Speaker 1: But I like how.

676
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:45,849
Speaker 1: when the game reveals stuff to you that your character would know, they're often surprising, because just starting the game, you wouldn't really have a sense of what year this might be set in.

677
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,015
Speaker 0: You know nothing about the setting.

678
00:45:49,055 --> 00:45:55,430
Speaker 0: There is not this intro, really, where they're like, "Oh, and the assumption's like some narrator coming in," right?

679
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:57,210
Speaker 0: You don't get that too much.

680
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,385
Speaker 1: But then you see a robot, and you're like, "Okay, there's definitely

681
00:45:59,425 --> 00:45:59,888
Speaker 1: robots.".

682
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:05,170
Speaker 1: But then, pretty early on, you find out that robots are actually ancient technology?

683
00:46:06,351 --> 00:46:06,959
Speaker 0: Yep, which we love.

684
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,710
Speaker 0: We love that makers are tech.

685
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,710
Speaker 0: They don't make robots anymore, probably.

686
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:12,910
Speaker 0: They can fix them, but they don't really make them.

687
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:25,250
Speaker 1: Yep, and you start to learn that this is a far future, like, Dune-esque far future universe of, like, transhuman nonsense, again, being vague because I don't want to spoil anything.

688
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:32,770
Speaker 1: But this is a far future where a lot of things are implied that have startling consequences and startling ramifications.

689
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:40,890
Speaker 0: So the way the game plays out is you walk around and you can talk to people, and when you talk to people, there are dialogue choices.

690
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:45,550
Speaker 0: And those dialogue choices are basically you're do and choose your own adventure.

691
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:54,070
Speaker 0: You're going to get different things happening based on what you choose, and you can't go back and undo your choices.

692
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,292
Speaker 0: But here's the difference.

693
00:46:55,693 --> 00:47:01,029
Speaker 1: Most games like that, it'll be like, "Do you kill the innocent child, or do you save

694
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:01,310
Speaker 1: them?".

695
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,950
Speaker 1: And there's a dialogue, and you pick one of the two options.

696
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,250
Speaker 1: This game, stuff is happening all the time.

697
00:47:07,431 --> 00:47:12,787
Speaker 1: You're trying to pilot your stupid ship, and the robot's talking to you, and he'll ask a question.

698
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:18,647
Speaker 1: And then you have to decide, "Do I answer his question, or do I start a different

699
00:47:18,687 --> 00:47:19,289
Speaker 1: conversation?".

700
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:23,050
Speaker 1: But that happens while you're doing this thing to pilot the ship around.

701
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:30,130
Speaker 1: So if you're ignoring the robot in the real world to play the game, your character ignores the robot in the game, and that matters.

702
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:31,572
Speaker 0: Yeah, it matters.

703
00:47:31,893 --> 00:47:36,210
Speaker 0: I think what matters more is, for example, there's a religion in the game called The Loop.

704
00:47:37,575 --> 00:47:38,257
Speaker 0: Which is a thing.

705
00:47:38,618 --> 00:47:41,248
Speaker 0: And at some point, characters will be like, "Oh, do you believe in The

706
00:47:41,288 --> 00:47:41,468
Speaker 0: Loop?".

707
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,436
Speaker 0: And they're totally chill.

708
00:47:43,456 --> 00:47:46,790
Speaker 0: They're not unaccepting of people who don't believe.

709
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,539
Speaker 0: They're not anything like that.

710
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:51,947
Speaker 0: But you can be like, "Yes," or

711
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:52,007
Speaker 0: "No."

712
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,879
Speaker 0: And then later, the characters, that matters.

713
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:58,567
Speaker 0: Later on, they'll be like, "I know you don't believe in The Whatever, but...".

714
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:05,210
Speaker 0: It's a permanent decision that you've made, and you can't change that decision unless you play the game again.

715
00:48:05,691 --> 00:48:12,269
Speaker 1: Instead of a small number of very, very important decisions that are very clear, like the game will go this direction.

716
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:24,389
Speaker 1: now, it's more like there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of more natural decisions that guide how all the characters interact with each other, and how they perceive your character as the game goes on.

717
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,823
Speaker 0: So very early in the game, I was talking with Rym about this part.

718
00:48:28,963 --> 00:48:30,590
Speaker 0: It's just a really illustrative moment.

719
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:36,430
Speaker 0: There is a place you end up, and there's a box you want to open, because you're doing archaeology, you want to know what's in the box.

720
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:40,997
Speaker 0: And there are several ways to open the box.

721
00:48:41,077 --> 00:48:47,949
Speaker 0: You can get the robot to open the box, you can smash it open, you can not open it at all, you can just leave it.

722
00:48:48,470 --> 00:49:03,870
Speaker 0: You can find a tool to open it with, or a different tool to open it with, perhaps a tool of archaeological value that might break when you try to open it with this tool.

723
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:07,897
Speaker 0: And these are just normal decisions.

724
00:49:07,937 --> 00:49:12,348
Speaker 0: These aren't point-and-click adventure kind of stuff, where it's like, "Oh, which thing do I have to

725
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:12,810
Speaker 0: use?".

726
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:18,026
Speaker 0: "Oh, I gotta use the hammer on the hamster to open up the microwave or some

727
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:18,567
Speaker 0: nonsense.".

728
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,087
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, do you want to open up the... what do you want to do?

729
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:30,990
Speaker 0: And the choice there has serious repercussions throughout the whole rest of the game.

730
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:39,302
Speaker 0: So it's like super choose your own adventure, but it's so... it's like a choose your own adventure.

731
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:42,650
Speaker 0: book doesn't have that many choices in it, really, and that many endings.

732
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,849
Speaker 1: This has so many small choices that add up.

733
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:57,430
Speaker 0: This has so many small choices that matter in different threads, and what happens is, even though the big plot only has so many endings, right?

734
00:49:58,353 --> 00:50:03,670
Speaker 0: All the different threads weave together to create a different cloth, right?

735
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:21,770
Speaker 0: So when you finally get to the... when you finish a play of the game, your woven cloth of all the different threads and choices you made will be dramatically different each time, and you have to play this game several times to discover all the possible things that could be.

736
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:22,591
Speaker 0: Yep.

737
00:50:22,892 --> 00:50:27,600
Speaker 1: And the choices are usually all very nuanced and interesting.

738
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:32,549
Speaker 1: They're not the like, "This is the good one, this is the bad one, this is the weird one that so many games

739
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:32,730
Speaker 1: have.".

740
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:32,911
Speaker 0: Nope.

741
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:35,130
Speaker 0: They're all difficult choices, usually.

742
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:43,450
Speaker 1: Like, a character's kind of annoying, and if you kind of don't pay attention to him, he picks up on that, and then his relationship with you is different.

743
00:50:44,618 --> 00:50:44,725
Speaker 0: Yep.

744
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,610
Speaker 1: Or if you engage with him, the relationship's different.

745
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:56,986
Speaker 1: Like, even very early on, I had a moment where there was a character on that first moon where I'm looking for the guy, and there's a character who's like, weirdly hostile.

746
00:50:57,147 --> 00:50:58,690
Speaker 1: Like, the bald guy.

747
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:16,570
Speaker 1: So, I kind of follow him, and I keep talking to him, and I eventually get him to tell me a bunch of information, but it definitely left a vibe, and I want to play the game again already just to interact with that situation as minor as it is, very differently, and see how different the game goes.

748
00:51:17,171 --> 00:51:19,355
Speaker 1: Or, like, you can just go anywhere.

749
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:21,519
Speaker 1: You can go try to find stuff before you're ready.

750
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:26,910
Speaker 1: You can just, "Fuck this mission, I'm gonna go back home and, like, go to my hometown, like, I don't even care about

751
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:27,030
Speaker 1: this.".

752
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,292
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can just do it.

753
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:42,658
Speaker 0: As soon as you leave that first place you start at the school or whatever, right, on the main capital planet of the nebula, right, you get in your little flying river boat thing, and you can go anywhere in the whole nebula that you can get to.

754
00:51:42,738 --> 00:51:47,306
Speaker 0: You can just go and explore whatever the heck you want to do.

755
00:51:47,767 --> 00:51:49,170
Speaker 0: You're totally free, right?

756
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:52,717
Speaker 0: You don't have to, you know, someone calls you, you don't have to do it, right?

757
00:51:53,279 --> 00:51:56,265
Speaker 0: There's no set plot you have to follow, right?

758
00:51:56,766 --> 00:51:58,450
Speaker 0: You can just be whatever you want to be.

759
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,395
Speaker 0: So, we've talked about all this.

760
00:52:00,415 --> 00:52:06,710
Speaker 0: choose your own adventure part, and there's also this sort of flying around the nebula part, right, you know, overworld part.

761
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:20,930
Speaker 0: But the biggest part of this game, what makes this game, you know, like, better than the Cloudpunk game, not that the Cloudpunk game is bad, the Cloudpunk game is really good, but, like, this is, like, some revolutionary, amazing game, is the language part.

762
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:23,150
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I love this part of the game.

763
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:29,721
Speaker 0: There is this, there's a whole article on Gamasutra, I think we can, I think that's where the article is?

764
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:34,530
Speaker 0: There's an article that's, like, how they came up with this language, right, it talks about the design process, how they did this.

765
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:52,150
Speaker 0: They invented a written language that does not exist, that looks generically, you know, ancient, right, of, you know, swirls and hash marks, you know, like, you could imagine this kind of writing on a rosetta stone or something like that, right, of another world.

766
00:52:54,230 --> 00:53:07,330
Speaker 0: And throughout the game, you don't speak this language, right, and no one really, you know, some people can sort of speak it and write it, but, you know, like, there's a guy in the library who kind of knows some of it a little bit, he helps you out.

767
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:14,730
Speaker 1: Like, it makes an interesting point at one spot along the way about how this ancient language feels like it was meant to be written down but never read.

768
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,070
Speaker 0: Yep.

769
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:38,010
Speaker 0: So you, as you're doing archaeology, right, by accident or on purpose, and you find things, you find this writing on lots of objects and places and written on walls and all over the place as you're going around the nebula and all these, you know, like, the current people who are alive don't use this language, written or spoken.

770
00:53:38,572 --> 00:53:41,520
Speaker 0: They use, you know, whatever your language you're playing the game in is.

771
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,887
Speaker 0: I assume you can play this game in not English.

772
00:53:43,948 --> 00:53:44,690
Speaker 0: I didn't actually check.

773
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:49,210
Speaker 1: We'll get to that in a minute because there are some problems with the game.

774
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:51,210
Speaker 1: Yeah.

775
00:53:51,431 --> 00:54:00,230
Speaker 0: But if you, you know, go to some abandoned, you know, rock somewhere and there's like a ruins, all the stuff in the ruins is written in this language.

776
00:54:00,731 --> 00:54:05,761
Speaker 0: And every time you encounter some of the language, right, you try to interpret it.

777
00:54:05,821 --> 00:54:10,169
Speaker 0: And the way you interpret it is by, OK, what is the thing that I found?

778
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:10,610
Speaker 0: Right.

779
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:14,798
Speaker 0: It's maybe it's, you know, a piece of clothing.

780
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,279
Speaker 0: Right.

781
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:20,090
Speaker 0: And then so what's written on it must make sense for something to be written on a piece of clothing.

782
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:20,310
Speaker 0: Right.

783
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:26,390
Speaker 0: It wouldn't say something like, you know, I don't know, set me on fire, please.

784
00:54:26,974 --> 00:54:29,029
Speaker 0: Sure to drink your Ovaltine.

785
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:30,191
Speaker 0: Right.

786
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:30,812
Speaker 0: Exactly.

787
00:54:31,734 --> 00:54:38,830
Speaker 0: So with the context of what the item is, plus the language you already know from other items.

788
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:49,540
Speaker 1: Plus inferences with characters that look similar that you recognize from other words, you know, plus words you already 100 percent figured out and are locked in.

789
00:54:50,402 --> 00:54:50,662
Speaker 0: Yep.

790
00:54:50,723 --> 00:54:54,091
Speaker 0: So you combine these things together and you sort of learn.

791
00:54:54,111 --> 00:54:54,692
Speaker 0: Right.

792
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:57,800
Speaker 0: Oh, well, if that said that, then this must say this.

793
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:04,137
Speaker 0: And you can use you drag and drop that the pieces of language, you know, basically to sort of like fill in.

794
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:05,080
Speaker 0: Right.

795
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:07,585
Speaker 0: The you know, the words.

796
00:55:08,426 --> 00:55:10,050
Speaker 0: And it's this amazing system of like.

797
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:15,200
Speaker 0: you're learning this language, ancient language as someone who didn't know any of it.

798
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:22,200
Speaker 0: And that's sort of the best video game approximation that at least I don't know if can be, but has ever been.

799
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:30,860
Speaker 0: And I can't imagine a better one for how actual archaeologists would learn an ancient language, you know, that no one in the no living person knows.

800
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:37,940
Speaker 1: I particularly enjoy how you can sort of intelligently figure some of this out pretty well early on.

801
00:55:38,441 --> 00:55:47,620
Speaker 1: But also you can make plausible but completely wrong translations that kind of inform how your character interacts with the world.

802
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:52,120
Speaker 1: And then that might get changed later when you learn a better translation.

803
00:55:52,580 --> 00:56:03,620
Speaker 1: And it has a nice system where it'll show a question mark next to words that you have locked in before, but the game has not confirmed or 100 percent true versus words that you have authoritatively translated.

804
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,522
Speaker 0: Yep, yep.

805
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:15,000
Speaker 0: And then you can go back at any time and you can go look at like all the scripts, right, that you haven't solved.

806
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,147
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, you know what, I've learned a whole lot.

807
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:20,499
Speaker 0: It's been, you know, there was that one long script I never solved.

808
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:20,760
Speaker 0: Right.

809
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,324
Speaker 0: But I've learned a lot since then.

810
00:56:22,485 --> 00:56:23,147
Speaker 0: Let me go back.

811
00:56:23,207 --> 00:56:27,120
Speaker 0: And you can go back and open up the menu and try to solve all the ones that you missed.

812
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:35,140
Speaker 0: There's like a little filter at the top where you can be like solved, yet to be solved, right, you know, can possibly solve, can't possibly solve.

813
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:42,920
Speaker 0: And you can basically go to the unsolved and can be solved list and sort of, you know, churn through them to learn more of the language.

814
00:56:43,261 --> 00:56:47,671
Speaker 0: And as you get to late in the game, there are some long, complicated scripts and new symbols.

815
00:56:47,952 --> 00:56:51,620
Speaker 0: And if you can translate them, that is very helpful and informative.

816
00:56:52,563 --> 00:56:54,598
Speaker 0: And if you can't, well, you can't.

817
00:56:55,381 --> 00:57:03,120
Speaker 1: Another system the game has that I really appreciate is you can just go anywhere to try to find stuff and stuff is there.

818
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:16,460
Speaker 1: But you can, based on data your character finds, like information you uncover, you can infer specific locations of interest with varying degrees of specificity.

819
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:23,680
Speaker 0: Anyway, well, it's for example, you'll find something and you'll be like, ah, this looks like it came from that site.

820
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:24,201
Speaker 1: Yeah.

821
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:24,442
Speaker 1: Right.

822
00:57:24,862 --> 00:57:26,286
Speaker 0: And it's like a site you've been to.

823
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:28,931
Speaker 0: Well, that means the date of this must be.

824
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:32,860
Speaker 0: this object must be from around this date, because that's how old that site was.

825
00:57:33,301 --> 00:57:37,191
Speaker 0: And that means that people from that site traveled to this location I'm in now.

826
00:57:37,773 --> 00:57:37,993
Speaker 0: Right.

827
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:40,380
Speaker 0: So there must be some relation between the two sites.

828
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:45,192
Speaker 1: Or you might infer that there is a site to visit in like this part of the nebula.

829
00:57:45,593 --> 00:57:48,040
Speaker 1: And it'll kind of show it outlined as a big area in the map.

830
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,147
Speaker 1: You could just head straight there and fly around on your own and try to find something.

831
00:57:52,548 --> 00:57:59,040
Speaker 1: But you can find other evidence that pieces together a puzzle to almost triangulate a more specific location.

832
00:57:59,140 --> 00:57:59,301
Speaker 1: Yeah.

833
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:03,232
Speaker 0: And you look at the map, there'll be these big blobs and it's like, yep, there's a site.

834
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:05,840
Speaker 0: The site from that item is somewhere in this blob.

835
00:58:06,141 --> 00:58:09,331
Speaker 0: But as you get more items from that site, the blob shrinks.

836
00:58:09,471 --> 00:58:12,360
Speaker 0: And then eventually you can travel there very easily because you know where to look.

837
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:12,660
Speaker 1: Yeah.

838
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:21,720
Speaker 1: But you might have a sense of urgency or just say fuck it and head to an area where you haven't gotten it completely narrowed down yet and still find it or find other interesting things along the way.

839
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:29,052
Speaker 1: But it's kind of again like the game, all these mechanics together give the game almost like movie beats.

840
00:58:29,793 --> 00:58:34,320
Speaker 1: Like the story feels like it progresses pretty naturally and your character's actions feel very natural.

841
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:40,180
Speaker 1: Because they reflect what you've been like putting into this character by making those little micro decisions along the way.

842
00:58:41,362 --> 00:58:48,391
Speaker 0: So my favorite part of the game is I think the analogy, the comparison I make is in Zelda, I think it was Twilight Princess.

843
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:54,620
Speaker 0: There's a part of the game where you find like this ancient, you know, Triforce Temple in like in the woods or something.

844
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,121
Speaker 0: Right.

845
00:58:55,522 --> 00:58:58,215
Speaker 0: And when I played that, not that Twilight Princess is amazing.

846
00:58:58,295 --> 00:58:58,858
Speaker 0: It's all right.

847
00:58:58,978 --> 00:58:59,240
Speaker 0: It's good.

848
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:07,212
Speaker 0: But when I found that temple, I got like this, these deep feelings of like, oh, I found the secret place.

849
00:59:07,312 --> 00:59:07,732
Speaker 0: Right.

850
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:11,919
Speaker 0: Like, you know, this awesome ancient place you've discovered all alone in the woods.

851
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,200
Speaker 0: Right.

852
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,429
Speaker 0: Like, you know, you busted into the hidden temple or you stop, you know, that kind of feeling.

853
00:59:16,489 --> 00:59:16,689
Speaker 0: Right.

854
00:59:16,709 --> 00:59:20,818
Speaker 0: Of like, this is a really important, amazing place I've discovered.

855
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:21,660
Speaker 0: I'm alone here.

856
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:26,248
Speaker 0: There's just this certain, you know, feeling of awe and whatnot that goes with that.

857
00:59:26,328 --> 00:59:26,508
Speaker 0: Right.

858
00:59:27,149 --> 00:59:33,420
Speaker 0: And in this game, I get that feeling literally every single place I visit.

859
00:59:33,621 --> 00:59:34,285
Speaker 0: Yep.

860
00:59:34,325 --> 00:59:36,900
Speaker 0: That's not populated by human characters.

861
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:46,080
Speaker 1: I ignored another character a bunch and like actually missed dialogue because I was so focused on like poking at the stuff I found on a site that I was visiting.

862
00:59:47,161 --> 00:59:47,341
Speaker 0: Yeah.

863
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:52,551
Speaker 0: It's like every site I find is like, holy shit, look at this place.

864
00:59:52,651 --> 00:59:53,072
Speaker 0: Right.

865
00:59:53,152 --> 00:59:53,974
Speaker 0: It's like amazing.

866
00:59:54,254 --> 00:59:57,060
Speaker 0: You know, every single one of them feels like I found.

867
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,520
Speaker 0: It's like every single site feels like I found the terrible secret of space just like over and over again.

868
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,486
Speaker 1: Like, oh, here's an abandoned asteroid.

869
01:00:03,506 --> 01:00:04,088
Speaker 1: There's nothing.

870
01:00:04,129 --> 01:00:05,292
Speaker 1: Why the fuck is there a house?

871
01:00:05,754 --> 01:00:06,597
Speaker 1: Why is there a house?

872
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:07,460
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

873
01:00:08,441 --> 01:00:09,203
Speaker 0: What is in this house?

874
01:00:09,303 --> 01:00:09,825
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

875
01:00:09,885 --> 01:00:14,800
Speaker 0: It's like, what is, you know, you're just finding these incredible things.

876
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:21,400
Speaker 1: Very, very different experiences with very, very early parts of the game is what fascinates me the most.

877
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:22,621
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

878
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:26,660
Speaker 0: So the negative thing about this game, the thing I like the least.

879
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,422
Speaker 1: There's a few negatives.

880
01:00:27,442 --> 01:00:28,967
Speaker 1: So one, the game has some technical problems.

881
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:32,397
Speaker 1: My controllers didn't fucking work with it at all.

882
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:33,400
Speaker 1: Like it shows the controller.

883
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:34,580
Speaker 0: No, mine had no problems.

884
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:37,528
Speaker 1: So my controller didn't work and I googled.

885
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:42,240
Speaker 1: It seems like half the people who play this game, their controllers just work and half the people play the game.

886
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,292
Speaker 1: Controllers get detected, but there's no input at all.

887
01:00:46,693 --> 01:00:48,740
Speaker 1: And if you reinstall the game, it fixes it.

888
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:49,982
Speaker 0: OK.

889
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:52,530
Speaker 1: Like it's a very specific problem that is common.

890
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:54,436
Speaker 0: And I encounter you want to play this with the game.

891
01:00:54,576 --> 01:00:55,740
Speaker 0: It's a gamepad game, by the way.

892
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,065
Speaker 1: Mouse and keyboard works fine, though.

893
01:00:57,668 --> 01:00:58,049
Speaker 0: It does.

894
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:59,495
Speaker 0: But it's I think it's you want.

895
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:00,760
Speaker 0: the gamepad is a is a smooth.

896
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:00,940
Speaker 1: Yeah.

897
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:02,504
Speaker 1: But problem the seconds.

898
01:01:02,986 --> 01:01:08,219
Speaker 1: the controls are not in any way customizable, except you can invert the Y axis on a mouse.

899
01:01:09,282 --> 01:01:10,386
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

900
01:01:10,407 --> 01:01:11,672
Speaker 1: That the lack of customizability.

901
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:12,756
Speaker 0: There's so few controls.

902
01:01:14,861 --> 01:01:16,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are so few controls.

903
01:01:17,911 --> 01:01:20,900
Speaker 0: So that's a good thing, I guess, that it's so simple.

904
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:21,783
Speaker 0: The controls.

905
01:01:21,963 --> 01:01:24,415
Speaker 0: But also, yeah, you got to have customizable controls.

906
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:25,320
Speaker 0: It's twenty twenty one.

907
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,543
Speaker 1: Yep.

908
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:33,740
Speaker 1: Like another keyboard is WASD and then like Q and R are like question and reply when you're just walking around.

909
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,420
Speaker 1: And then you just literally point at things and click on them to interact.

910
01:01:39,242 --> 01:01:39,603
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

911
01:01:39,623 --> 01:01:42,031
Speaker 0: So the thing I like least about the game is the.

912
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:44,820
Speaker 0: is this the flying the boat, whatever it's called.

913
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,680
Speaker 1: I like the flying because it sort of gives a story beat pause and the car.

914
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,814
Speaker 1: So I have with the robot are interesting along the way.

915
01:01:52,874 --> 01:01:54,180
Speaker 0: Yes, that is correct.

916
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:58,919
Speaker 0: So the the the the the way the boat contributes to the pacing of the story.

917
01:01:58,999 --> 01:01:59,140
Speaker 0: Right.

918
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:12,020
Speaker 0: This time where you're traveling between places, this freedom of exploring, plus the dialog with the road, with your whoever's in your ship with you, you're talking to them as you're flying, getting more dialog.

919
01:02:12,501 --> 01:02:16,368
Speaker 0: And you're occasionally encountering a little tiny mini ruins.

920
01:02:16,448 --> 01:02:23,180
Speaker 0: And basically what those are is you're flying, you see one, you push one button, you stop and you get one artifact.

921
01:02:23,481 --> 01:02:25,609
Speaker 0: And then you get one script from it.

922
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:25,991
Speaker 0: Right.

923
01:02:26,192 --> 01:02:28,300
Speaker 0: And that helps you with your language learning.

924
01:02:29,181 --> 01:02:31,207
Speaker 0: And it's sort of something to do while you're flying.

925
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:35,600
Speaker 0: But the flying itself, A, there is no skill to it.

926
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,864
Speaker 0: It's just like you can't crash.

927
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:37,747
Speaker 0: You can't go.

928
01:02:38,228 --> 01:02:40,014
Speaker 0: Even if you go the wrong way, you push a button.

929
01:02:40,195 --> 01:02:41,740
Speaker 0: It says like, oh, no, you're going the wrong way.

930
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,103
Speaker 0: You didn't want to go this way.

931
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:48,360
Speaker 0: If you don't want to go this way, push this button will teleport you back to the last, you know, walk fork in the road.

932
01:02:48,861 --> 01:02:49,767
Speaker 0: Right.

933
01:02:50,632 --> 01:02:51,940
Speaker 0: It's very time consuming.

934
01:02:53,061 --> 01:03:03,140
Speaker 0: So if on my first game play through and I recommend the same for other people, my first play through, I actually flew the boat almost everywhere.

935
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:18,120
Speaker 0: But on my new game plus it basically, if you're flying somewhere on paths you've already been on, you can just push a button and it'll teleport you right to the end or not necessarily the end, but as far along this road that you have traveled already.

936
01:03:18,741 --> 01:03:18,861
Speaker 0: Right.

937
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:28,360
Speaker 0: So that you're only ever piloting the boat manually if it's on new river that you have stream, whatever that you haven't already piloted on.

938
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,324
Speaker 0: So you'll never drive down the same road twice.

939
01:03:32,106 --> 01:03:37,859
Speaker 0: And at least they recognize that that part of the game is really boring, tedious, just filler.

940
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:38,260
Speaker 0: Right.

941
01:03:38,601 --> 01:03:39,464
Speaker 0: And they let you skip it.

942
01:03:39,505 --> 01:03:40,087
Speaker 0: So that's good.

943
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:43,259
Speaker 0: But also they could have spiced it up.

944
01:03:43,339 --> 01:03:43,500
Speaker 0: Right.

945
01:03:44,962 --> 01:03:50,500
Speaker 1: But I do appreciate how you can't fail at it other than getting lost or going the wrong way.

946
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:50,941
Speaker 0: I do agree.

947
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:51,182
Speaker 0: Right.

948
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:56,960
Speaker 0: So cloud punk is sort of the opposite in that there are in cloud punk, there's fuel that you can run out of.

949
01:03:57,621 --> 01:04:03,920
Speaker 0: And there's at least one scene in cloud punk where like the speed and skill with which you fly the thing actually matters.

950
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:06,760
Speaker 0: And I didn't like that in a game where that had never mattered before.

951
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:12,020
Speaker 1: So the only thing that actually annoys me about the game, like that technical issue with the controller is like fine.

952
01:04:13,162 --> 01:04:24,140
Speaker 1: I don't like how slow the main character walks because in some of the sites there is a very, very long path to get to an interesting thing.

953
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,545
Speaker 1: And it's very easy to not bother and miss something.

954
01:04:30,848 --> 01:04:40,360
Speaker 1: Like it takes a long time to walk all the way up the terraces in the first place you're likely to go to then even meet that bald guy to have that conversation.

955
01:04:42,122 --> 01:04:44,169
Speaker 0: Yeah.

956
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:47,060
Speaker 0: I don't remember if there was a running button or not.

957
01:04:47,704 --> 01:04:48,088
Speaker 1: There isn't.

958
01:04:48,148 --> 01:04:49,360
Speaker 1: at least that I saw on the keyboard.

959
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:52,620
Speaker 0: I don't remember because I haven't played it in like a week or a few.

960
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:58,140
Speaker 1: There is not even an option in the configuration to see the controls, let alone customize them.

961
01:04:59,161 --> 01:04:59,443
Speaker 0: Yeah.

962
01:05:00,327 --> 01:05:02,678
Speaker 0: It does have some problems in that territory for sure.

963
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:03,040
Speaker 0: Right.

964
01:05:04,482 --> 01:05:09,480
Speaker 0: The interface could be made such that you could play through this game very, very quickly if they wanted to.

965
01:05:09,741 --> 01:05:13,860
Speaker 1: A lot of it is to make sure the story beats match up and to make sure you have time to get this dialogue.

966
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:22,800
Speaker 1: But I guess despite those minor annoyances, this game is worth playing just because I struggle to point you at games that are like this game.

967
01:05:25,043 --> 01:05:25,485
Speaker 0: Yeah.

968
01:05:25,906 --> 01:05:29,260
Speaker 0: The language thing alone is worth being a game on its own, right?

969
01:05:30,102 --> 01:05:33,580
Speaker 0: The story of the game and the characters in the game are awesome.

970
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:40,838
Speaker 0: Discovering the secrets of the world, getting that feeling of, "Oh my God, I've discovered the Holy Secret Place like ten

971
01:05:40,898 --> 01:05:41,359
Speaker 0: times."

972
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:42,341
Speaker 0: Right?

973
01:05:42,924 --> 01:05:44,432
Speaker 0: Or like, "Every, you know, is

974
01:05:44,492 --> 01:05:44,975
Speaker 0: amazing.".

975
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:51,877
Speaker 1: I mean, even that early moment, not really a spoiler because it happened so early, but when I realized that, "Oh, they dig up the

976
01:05:51,917 --> 01:05:52,478
Speaker 1: robots?"

977
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,632
Speaker 1: Like, "Ooh, wait a minute.

978
01:05:54,914 --> 01:05:55,337
Speaker 1: Wait a

979
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:55,680
Speaker 1: minute.".

980
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:56,093
Speaker 1: Spoiler, please.

981
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:03,660
Speaker 1: I went into the timeline and I kept scrolling left to see, like, how ancient things are and there's a lot of timeline way to the left.

982
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:11,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I can say, you know, I got to the Heaven's Vault and it's like, it's really rare that I ever play a game, a solo, a single player video game more than once.

983
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:19,079
Speaker 0: The fact that I actually started a new game plus of this game, which I have never done since, like, Chrono Trigger maybe, right?

984
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,260
Speaker 0: It's like, that's telling you something.

985
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,678
Speaker 0: Like, I really want to know what the other things are.

986
01:06:26,302 --> 01:06:32,340
Speaker 0: And the internet doesn't actually have a great sort of cliff note that I can just read and get all the spoilers.

987
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:46,160
Speaker 0: So I'm forced to play it again and luckily, like I said, you can, and your second playthrough is a lot faster because when you're new game plus, you keep your map so you can fast travel all the fast travels that you did before.

988
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:51,160
Speaker 0: You only have to pilot, again, a new undiscovered roads, roads, rivers, streams.

989
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:56,540
Speaker 0: And also you keep all the language you learned from your previous playthrough.

990
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:08,860
Speaker 0: It is basically impossible, I guess not actually impossible, but effectively impossible to learn the whole language and decipher all the scripts on the one playthrough unless you are so thorough and take so much time and go everywhere.

991
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,060
Speaker 1: But it kind of plays the character.

992
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:16,400
Speaker 0: And even then it might not be possible because you can't do all the different paths through the story in one playthrough, right?

993
01:07:16,821 --> 01:07:20,453
Speaker 0: You choose A, you might discover one thing and you choose B, you'll discover another thing.

994
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:22,340
Speaker 0: You can't discover them both in one play of the game.

995
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:30,780
Speaker 1: And you're going to jump around like the game, like I got impatient and missed some stuff because I wanted to steamroll towards something I saw that was interesting.

996
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,858
Speaker 1: But depending on the context, going there earlier made different revelations appear.

997
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:40,920
Speaker 1: Like you'll see, play the game twice, you'll get radically different experiences.

998
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:52,020
Speaker 0: So on the second playthrough, you have all the text you learned from the previous playthrough and if you take different paths, you'll obviously uncover different scripts and that's how you can learn the whole language.

999
01:07:52,280 --> 01:08:07,800
Speaker 0: And towards the end of the game, that's how you can completely decipher the very long scripts, which obviously when you do that, now unlocks different paths through the story and gives you different threads to combine into the cloth that makes up the story of that playthrough.

1000
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:15,219
Speaker 0: So yeah, not a perfect game, still a little indie game, but still amazing what they were able to do.

1001
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:20,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ankle made something unique and what I look forward to, one, this game is great.

1002
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:24,859
Speaker 1: Like you should play, if you care about games at all, play it just to see what we're talking about.

1003
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:39,520
Speaker 0: Not just a visual novel, not just a JRPG with no combat, not just to choose your own adventure, not just a point and click adventure, but the good parts of all of those and not the bad parts.

1004
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:49,479
Speaker 1: Just this concept of micro-interactions in a game, having a larger effect later in the game, that is something I've never seen done well before.

1005
01:08:49,981 --> 01:08:58,138
Speaker 0: Right, it's like Chrono Trigger was the game where it's like, "Oh, you didn't do the thing in the bazaar at the start and now you're at the

1006
01:08:58,218 --> 01:08:58,738
Speaker 0: trial.".

1007
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:05,080
Speaker 0: And that was a huge impact in Chrono Trigger because what game had done that before?

1008
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,419
Speaker 1: But it was still very like, "There aren't that many branches in that

1009
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,580
Speaker 1: game.".

1010
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:12,325
Speaker 0: Right, and it was only one small part of the game.

1011
01:09:12,426 --> 01:09:16,551
Speaker 0: Most of that game is JRPG with the combat and such.

1012
01:09:16,571 --> 01:09:19,015
Speaker 0: That's only one part of the game, it's one small part.

1013
01:09:19,354 --> 01:09:22,560
Speaker 0: This is like, the whole game is that part of Chrono Trigger.

1014
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:33,435
Speaker 1: But this, if you open up to certain characters and reveal things to them that they want to know from you, different things happen, but if you're cautious and don't tell them things, other things happen.

1015
01:09:33,895 --> 01:09:37,060
Speaker 1: and there's a lot of gray area between those two types of outcomes.

1016
01:09:39,224 --> 01:09:48,000
Speaker 0: And not to mention, the plot itself is one in which many different peoples are represented well.

1017
01:09:49,741 --> 01:09:56,171
Speaker 0: The robot, this is like a huge part of the game, the robot doesn't have legs, it has tracks.

1018
01:09:56,771 --> 01:10:02,040
Speaker 0: And the robot often complains when you go places like, "I can't get there, there's no

1019
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:02,280
Speaker 0: ramp.".

1020
01:10:03,162 --> 01:10:08,712
Speaker 0: It is a very much accessibility allegory.

1021
01:10:10,475 --> 01:10:12,820
Speaker 0: Targeting you right in the beams.

1022
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:20,420
Speaker 1: Though I'll admit, at one point I didn't super trust the robot and pointedly tried to get away from the robot to look at some things.

1023
01:10:21,241 --> 01:10:25,048
Speaker 0: No one's in the game, none of the characters are straight up good or straight up evil.

1024
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:32,120
Speaker 0: It's all vague and ambiguous, and on different plays you can trust or align yourself with different people more or less.

1025
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:44,278
Speaker 0: And it's interesting, usually when I play games with these kinds of choices, I can just always choose the good choice, like "I'm a good guy, good choice, good choice, good

1026
01:10:44,318 --> 01:10:44,679
Speaker 0: choice.".

1027
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is fallout, right?

1028
01:10:47,725 --> 01:10:48,146
Speaker 0: Or whatever.

1029
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:49,770
Speaker 0: Just choose "be good guy" or "be bad

1030
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:50,071
Speaker 0: guy.".

1031
01:10:50,131 --> 01:10:53,057
Speaker 0: Here, there is no obvious good guy bad guy choice.

1032
01:10:53,197 --> 01:10:54,340
Speaker 0: All the choices are difficult.

1033
01:10:54,520 --> 01:11:04,129
Speaker 0: You're like, "Yeah, okay, that guy is kind of a jerk, but maybe he's not, I don't know, should I sell the robot to this

1034
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:04,249
Speaker 0: guy?".

1035
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:24,020
Speaker 1: Because the way the character interacted leading up to that moment, it just felt like something was wrong about what she was asking me to do, like something was off.

1036
01:11:25,602 --> 01:11:27,420
Speaker 1: And that I wanted to play this game again.

1037
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:30,460
Speaker 0: That was my feeling on the first playthrough, I felt that way also.

1038
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,368
Speaker 1: And the robot was like, "We should go back and tell her all this stuff we

1039
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:33,589
Speaker 1: found.".

1040
01:11:33,609 --> 01:11:34,572
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Fuck no!

1041
01:11:34,913 --> 01:11:36,017
Speaker 1: I ain't telling her shit

1042
01:11:36,519 --> 01:11:36,739
Speaker 1: yet!".

1043
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:43,238
Speaker 0: I felt the same way on my first playthrough, but then on my second playthrough I'm like, "You know what, what happens if you do just tell her

1044
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:43,719
Speaker 0: everything?".

1045
01:11:44,661 --> 01:11:46,920
Speaker 0: Doesn't seem bad so far, actually.

1046
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:54,580
Speaker 1: But then I encountered the bald guy who didn't trust me and was worried that I was going to be a problem for him if he revealed some information.

1047
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,899
Speaker 1: And seeing that dynamic is just fascinating in a game like this.

1048
01:12:00,761 --> 01:12:02,586
Speaker 1: So yeah, I don't know what else we can say.

1049
01:12:02,606 --> 01:12:07,760
Speaker 1: If you're not convinced to try this game, why do you even listen to Geek Nights?

1050
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,367
Speaker 1: This is the kind of game we try to highlight.

1051
01:12:10,407 --> 01:12:11,631
Speaker 1: This is a unique experience.

1052
01:12:12,493 --> 01:12:14,980
Speaker 1: Unique experiences are rare in the world.

1053
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:26,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is one of those games where you look at the box of the game and it has, you know when movies win awards, they always put those little gold film festival things with the little wheats on the side, right?

1054
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:28,780
Speaker 0: This game has a whole bunch of those on the cover.

1055
01:12:29,082 --> 01:12:29,799
Speaker 0: It's a pile of wheats.

1056
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:34,081
Speaker 1: The New Yorker, best video game of 2019.

1057
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:35,226
Speaker 0: There you go.

1058
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:37,154
Speaker 0: Play this game.

1059
01:12:37,334 --> 01:12:38,760
Speaker 0: Heaven's Vault, not Gate.

1060
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,197
Speaker 0: Not Gate.

1061
01:12:40,145 --> 01:12:40,318
Speaker 0: Vault.

1062
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,250

Speaker 0: Seize the child!

1076
01:13:48,711 --> 01:13:51,570
Speaker 0: I'm sorry son, but this is for your own good.

01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:57,989

1079
01:14:00,443 --> 01:14:01,350
Speaker 0: You must wait.

1080
01:14:01,892 --> 01:14:07,069
Speaker 0: Yes, tie him up with normal spaghetti and bring him food, yes!

1081
01:14:08,571 --> 01:14:13,770
Speaker 0: Soon you will see my boy, all good things come to those who wait.
