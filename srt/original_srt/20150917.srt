1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,494
Speaker 1: It's probably Thursday September 17th 2015.

2
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:15,720
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:26,430
Speaker 1: I might be in Singapore or Australia or something, but we recorded a bunch of shows ahead of time and tonight We're talking about on the geek nights book club the first book of the wheel of time.

4
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:34,711
Speaker 0: It is the eye of the world by Robert Jordan Fantasy book the novel part one part one.

5
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:39,688
Speaker 0: Let's do this, but first Things of the day.

6
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,895
Speaker 0: you can't do news recording a show in the past.

7
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:43,340
Speaker 0: cuz who knows what's happened today?

8
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:44,063
Speaker 0: We don't know.

9
00:00:44,143 --> 00:00:47,296
Speaker 1: cuz we're in the past, but it's the lounge so we could talk about anything.

10
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:48,100
Speaker 1: commentary.

11
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:59,620
Speaker 0: Anyway, so my thing of the day is this guy longboarding down a really steep road Which isn't really that exciting except for the fact that I think this is a world record speed of longboarding.

12
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,289
Speaker 1: It's not going away fast.

13
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,314
Speaker 0: It's not world record.

14
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,500
Speaker 0: It doesn't really freaking matter.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,700
Speaker 0: He's going like 70 miles an hour with no helmet on a longboard with no brakes down a road.

16
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:18,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, the road is smooth But I mean one rock in the road and he could boom bump tumble tree dead and that does not happen Which makes this video awesome?

17
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:23,420
Speaker 0: The coolest thing I think is like he's got this stance practice for when he's going straight.

18
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:28,800
Speaker 0: It's like he's got these perfect balance going on and he's also got these gauntlet kind of gloves on his hands.

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:40,286
Speaker 0: I think he has discs of metal or some kind of material so that when he has to make a sharp turn He can lean and actually put his hand on the ground and to stabilize himself without you know You got a glove on.

20
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:41,575
Speaker 0: that wouldn't even suffice, right?

21
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:43,985
Speaker 0: He needs this Like hockey gloves.

22
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:44,990
Speaker 1: You just wear right through him.

23
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:45,512
Speaker 0: Sure.

24
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:46,959
Speaker 0: So there you go.

25
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:58,216
Speaker 1: So this is a clay video that is about 10 minutes worth of just footage some natural some staged or recreated Just because you know old-timey equipment of the New York City subway.

26
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:05,700
Speaker 0: in 1949 they shot this with film cameras like black-and-white films spinning through a loop, right?

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,720
Speaker 1: What's amazing is that the only things that are different between then and today?

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,795
Speaker 1: 2015 are one the accents to the conductor's.

29
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:17,440
Speaker 0: you can still hear those accents in some parts.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,512
Speaker 1: Not not quite as as New York is.

31
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:21,676
Speaker 1: this they're.

32
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:22,580
Speaker 1: they're kind of surprising.

33
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:26,699
Speaker 1: Yes The doors are deadly.

34
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, they should be more dead.

35
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:30,119
Speaker 1: Yep, and there's tokens.

36
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:31,262
Speaker 0: Tokens.

37
00:02:31,323 --> 00:02:32,388
Speaker 0: you never saw the tokens.

38
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:34,598
Speaker 0: I never used you ever use the token to go through a toll.

39
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:39,640
Speaker 1: No Yeah on the on the Garden State Park read throw change into the bucket.

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,247
Speaker 0: No the token you would go to the.

41
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:50,625
Speaker 0: what you would do is you would either if you went through like the toll every day Cuz you were commuting you would buy that and have them mail you the tokens like in rolls like you would get quarters in a roll.

42
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:53,517
Speaker 0: you get tokens in a roll and you'd pay like a fee monthly or whatever.

43
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,622
Speaker 0: but Or you would drive up to the toll booth and want and you would buy Tokens.

44
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:07,240
Speaker 0: and then if you buy like a roll of tokens for like 20 bucks or whatever and then every time you got to a Toll you throw in one token into the thing and then it would just you go through the toll.

45
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:11,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the amazing thing isn't just that this video is, you know, cool.

46
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:22,108
Speaker 1: but if you click on this video You're gonna get a bunch of recommended videos on YouTube and it is pretty much nothing but similar Amazing footage of old and new subway stuff.

47
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:23,171
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:36,117
Speaker 1: I've been doing a lot of subway stuff recently because New York actually Just recently for the first time In pretty much all modern history actually expanded the subway system and added a new stop.

49
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:39,816
Speaker 1: Whoa Yeah, it's we can go on in a few days.

50
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:40,419
Speaker 1: We can ride there.

51
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:43,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw the map in the subway car had already updated with the stop.

52
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:46,197
Speaker 0: I didn't know if the train was going there yet because I was at.

53
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:51,020
Speaker 0: I was at Times Square and the seven train is, you know still said last stop.

54
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,244
Speaker 0: So I'm pretty sure.

55
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:56,519
Speaker 1: but in Grand Central the sign says the name of Hudson Yards.

56
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,000
Speaker 0: now It says the Hudson Yards bound seven just in time to go to the New York Comic Con.

57
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,035
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm not gonna go to.

58
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:05,732
Speaker 1: nope They didn't want my panel.

59
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:17,266
Speaker 1: Oh, well, yep New York Comic Con a con so big and amazing that despite the fact that I can literally take the subway to it for free Next to my house.

60
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:19,675
Speaker 0: I would go, you know a few years ago.

61
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:24,813
Speaker 0: We went just to see Like, you know screenings of films and things that happened to be there.

62
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went to see Makoto Shinkai, right?

63
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:28,855
Speaker 0: But they aren't having that now.

64
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,105
Speaker 1: So no It's literally it's the only.

65
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,369
Speaker 1: it's the things I hate about cons.

66
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:38,683
Speaker 1: It's a giant Expo Hall a place with no no food to eat and A huge line.

67
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,889
Speaker 0: Maybe the Hudson Yards stop will create food to eat.

68
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,099
Speaker 0: Maybe we should open up a foodery near there as the Bellas.

69
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:50,140
Speaker 0: perhaps You know, you need to buy out some old like auto shop that's over there.

70
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:55,020
Speaker 1: You need to take the de Bellas formula to make the de Bellas truck.

71
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:59,719
Speaker 1: It's just a giant Winnebago and you pull it up outside of events and do the de Bellas thing.

72
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:03,490
Speaker 0: There is a submarine sandwich Italian.

73
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,120
Speaker 1: Do they make like ten subs a minute?

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,738
Speaker 0: I don't know how many they make but sometimes they're near my work and I haven't even bothered to go try them out.

75
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:18,805
Speaker 0: because if they Back way back when I worked at that stupid day Do not have a much enough people in a line outside of them to bet if they made ten subs a minute They would have no people outside.

76
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:22,400
Speaker 1: I mean I could make us an entire sub in about 30 seconds.

77
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,068
Speaker 1: Well, you can train everybody.

78
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:25,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'll count the money now.

79
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:32,291
Speaker 1: We gotta get the guy who trained me The master Time a of subs the book.

80
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:32,995
Speaker 1: a book is.

81
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,558
Speaker 1: well, we're done.

82
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:39,020
Speaker 1: now I'm gonna pick a new book club book Which is tough because I'm pretty much pick something that you're gonna read in Singapore.

83
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,069
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna read the next Wheel of Time books.

84
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:41,531
Speaker 1: Oops.

85
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:43,580
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll just do book two of the Wheel of Time.

86
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:52,724
Speaker 1: Let's not do that, uh, maybe I'll pick the next our Scott back your book because there's a date now supposedly how good we're gonna Do this book club in 2025?

87
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:54,911
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see when the date is.

88
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:57,340
Speaker 1: There's like there's no pre-order yet on Amazon.

89
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,123
Speaker 0: So Wheel of Time.

90
00:05:58,163 --> 00:06:08,480
Speaker 0: I chose this book on the basis that the Wheel of Time is one of those ridiculously famous fantasy series just like Lord of the Rings and The Games of Thrones.

91
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:13,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's one of those things where if like if you go to an anime con and you're like cowboy bebop What's that?

92
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:21,980
Speaker 0: And all the other people are like what you've never seen cowboy bebop, you know, they're like certain You know, there's like sci-fi series like, you know foundation.

93
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:29,168
Speaker 0: And what's another good one, you know the culture series Even that's more recent.

94
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:34,775
Speaker 0: in the fantasy sci-fi nerd section of the bookstore There are certain book series that are just there.

95
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:35,720
Speaker 0: They're perennial.

96
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:44,580
Speaker 0: They're always, you know, they're a thing and being a nerd I feel like I should you know know at least some about all of these things because they're so important nerderies.

97
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:57,180
Speaker 0: But Wheel of Time while it's had many RPGs made out of it and things of that nature It hasn't had TV series or movies or anything like that to bring it into the greater pop culture.

98
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:57,503
Speaker 0: It's like.

99
00:06:57,523 --> 00:06:59,520
Speaker 0: I think most people don't know what the hell this is at all.

100
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,753
Speaker 0: But nerds you see those books and it's like you.

101
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:07,840
Speaker 0: even if you haven't read it you at least know That is one of the big fantasy novel series.

102
00:07:08,402 --> 00:07:13,360
Speaker 1: So I knew about them because of all things there was when I was a kid.

103
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:20,127
Speaker 1: There was the museum replicas magazine where you could like or catalog where you could order swords And I didn't have money luckily, so I never bought any.

104
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:24,720
Speaker 1: but the best sword they had was called the heron blade.

105
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:28,052
Speaker 0: Oh, and it talked about like yeah, not as good as the heron spear.

106
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,160
Speaker 0: What's up with herons and weapons and fantasy series?

107
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:35,677
Speaker 1: Would suspect that the heron spear was perhaps inspired by the heron blade.

108
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:36,480
Speaker 0: you think so?

109
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:37,588
Speaker 1: I do think so.

110
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:47,695
Speaker 1: maybe the problem I the the main reason I'm really kind of invested in these books now the Wheel of Time and why I think was a good Book club choice for you to pick is that you didn't think that when I picked it originally.

111
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:57,120
Speaker 1: No, I didn't because Super at least you admit that I was not enthusiastic about reading however many million pages that that's exactly what I'm saying.

112
00:07:57,281 --> 00:08:03,306
Speaker 0: I discovered these books because I spent a lot of time in the nerd section of the borders and the Barnes and Nobles in my Day as it.

113
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:15,066
Speaker 0: you know when I was younger before Amazon existed especially Sam and I'd see them and I knew that they were a fantasy series called Wheel of Time and that the books were ginormous and That made me not want to read them.

114
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:18,680
Speaker 0: like it makes me not want to read Ulysses like I saw those Piers Anthony books.

115
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:21,358
Speaker 1: I was like nope just not gonna not open in those.

116
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:27,000
Speaker 0: yeah I mean I knew people who read them and they would say things to me about them that weren't exactly.

117
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,758
Speaker 0: You know, they didn't say they were bad, but they wouldn't give a strong recommendation such as you must read these.

118
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:33,861
Speaker 0: Oh my god They're amazing.

119
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:36,030
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be real with you guys because of that.

120
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:37,818
Speaker 0: I didn't ever bother to read them.

121
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:47,353
Speaker 1: my friends I trust and listeners and fans that I trust or at least seem intelligent and seem like worldly and well-read Basically say yeah, they're pretty good.

122
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:47,777
Speaker 1: They're okay.

123
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,639
Speaker 1: Or like they said they're pretty good.

124
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:53,660
Speaker 1: I really like them and they have a lot of like personal investment.

125
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,533
Speaker 1: But they wouldn't pretend they're like the greatest fantasy books ever.

126
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:00,509
Speaker 0: and but it turns out, you know There's a lot of people, you know nerds who have read them.

127
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:03,880
Speaker 0: people just don't discuss novels as much as they discuss other things.

128
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:10,820
Speaker 0: So but once you start talking about it It's like oh you start seeing who's read them and suddenly people have a lot to say and so far almost everyone's read them.

129
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:13,632
Speaker 0: So a lot of people not everybody by quite a lot.

130
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:15,340
Speaker 1: I bring them up in casual conversations.

131
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:17,608
Speaker 0: I remember in college Alex and Greg read them.

132
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:19,174
Speaker 0: Alex had like the hardcovers.

133
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:19,575
Speaker 0: They were Jay.

134
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:20,920
Speaker 0: No, they were even scarier looking.

135
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:28,120
Speaker 1: Well, it's like when we we all read the Prince of Nothing and basically our entire friend group would do nothing But talk about the Prince of Nothing for like a couple years.

136
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:41,279
Speaker 0: So the series goes on for many many books and then Robert Jordan sadly passed away some years ago Not too long ago, and then but unlike someone else finished the series I was like Ian M banks in the culture.

137
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:52,395
Speaker 1: He Robert Jordan basically had a protege like a person who could finish the series In a set in a way that would be satisfying and feel can.

138
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:56,780
Speaker 0: I haven't read that far obviously But I haven't heard anyone say that, you know, don't read those.

139
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:02,699
Speaker 0: They just sort of like accept those as like the real end of the series Even though there's two authors and they don't seem to have a problem with it.

140
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least as far as I can tell.

141
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:06,980
Speaker 0: but we're only talking about book one today.

142
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:17,678
Speaker 0: So if you've listened to our you know Usually when we do regular Ignite episodes and we say the book club book is we sort of make some small Comments about what we read recently in that book.

143
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:22,854
Speaker 0: and You know the two main things that we pointed out in those times were number one.

144
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,460
Speaker 0: This is fantasy novel like.

145
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,527
Speaker 1: Maybe it's because the only like.

146
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:29,459
Speaker 1: I've read a lot of fantasy, but I've basically read two classes of fantasy.

147
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:30,744
Speaker 1: Three.

148
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,430
Speaker 1: I've read the classic like Tolkien.

149
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,073
Speaker 0: Yeah.

150
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:34,960
Speaker 0: Well token is more the poetic kind.

151
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's about you know, it's.

152
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:45,954
Speaker 0: it's not just about the story It's also about the flowery prose and you know And the world-building and the consistency and there's a lot going on there.

153
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:47,820
Speaker 1: right I've read garbage.

154
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:50,208
Speaker 0: I haven't read as much garbage.

155
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:50,750
Speaker 0: I've read.

156
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,560
Speaker 0: I haven't read none, but I've read much less garbage than you.

157
00:10:53,781 --> 00:11:03,780
Speaker 1: I read basically every forgotten realms book from when I was in high school and earlier Except I never read the drizz door in books because they looked really bad.

158
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:11,960
Speaker 0: Even when I was a kid the closest thing to garbage that I read was which I don't think is garbage Actually, I kind of liked it was Fred Saver Hagen series.

159
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:16,560
Speaker 0: Oh, there was like the books of swords and each book was about a different ridiculously powerful awesome sword.

160
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,931
Speaker 0: No that existed in this fantasy world.

161
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:20,880
Speaker 0: They never finished that series, but I really liked it.

162
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,253
Speaker 1: I read one six of the books I would want one Dragon Lance book and it was so garbage that I never read another one.

163
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:32,294
Speaker 1: I started reading Piers Anthony Dragons gold serpent silver chimera.

164
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:33,560
Speaker 0: That sounds like garbage.

165
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:44,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, that book is like 900 bajillion pages long and it was so bad I literally more than halfway through just said you know what no and closed it and never opened it again.

166
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,160
Speaker 0: So the other kind of fantasy novel is like, you know, the prince of nothing kind.

167
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're actually some.

168
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:51,572
Speaker 0: it's actually, you know, real.

169
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,940
Speaker 0: let it quote quote real literature, right?

170
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:56,540
Speaker 0: I know it's a no true Scotsman, but you know what I'm saying?

171
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's but it happens to be in a setting that can be considered.

172
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,560
Speaker 0: puts it in a fantasy section of the bookstore.

173
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,670
Speaker 0: There might be people with magical powers.

174
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,700
Speaker 0: There's some sort of map in the book.

175
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,070
Speaker 1: It may be based in some of those days of true people.

176
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:11,180
Speaker 0: It's a historical kind of you know.

177
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:20,280
Speaker 0: It's set in something that's like a historical earth where you know There's medieval or Roman or some Roman or medieval like society.

178
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,530
Speaker 1: Well, here's the difference.

179
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:25,734
Speaker 1: like a Tolkien is Here is a fantasy world and a story.

180
00:12:25,774 --> 00:12:35,372
Speaker 0: It isn't particular Overarching allegory, yeah, there are swords and or sorcerers in the story like Some kind the Hobbit is about the Hobbit.

181
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,399
Speaker 1: Yes, and then the ring and all that stuff.

182
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:41,017
Speaker 1: The prince of nothing is about solipsism and philosophy.

183
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:41,600
Speaker 0: exactly.

184
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:43,449
Speaker 0: So the.

185
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:56,188
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm used to like super gritty Deconstructive dark like horrible fantasy and I'm used to garbage fantasy and I'm used to Tolkien and this is like Straight fantasy.

186
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:59,701
Speaker 0: it is literally like the It's.

187
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,327
Speaker 0: it's weird in a way in that.

188
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,876
Speaker 0: It's like wow, there's nothing this book is doing.

189
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:12,179
Speaker 0: that is like Different or you know like standing out in any way from what you expect fantasy to be.

190
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,374
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's some sort of magic system that is you know, sort of mysterious.

191
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:19,580
Speaker 0: and you know, how do the world works mystery?

192
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,098
Speaker 0: That's in every fantasy novel ever.

193
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:29,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a guy with an awesome sword who rises up from being like peasant up to Ridiculously important amazing powerful character who changes history.

194
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:34,051
Speaker 1: Yeah Bloods of ancient kings like battles from distant past.

195
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:36,920
Speaker 0: a map in the book multiple maps in the book.

196
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,610
Speaker 0: It's like every you know single trope that is there.

197
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:43,960
Speaker 0: that is a stereotype of fantasy novels is in this book.

198
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:48,477
Speaker 0: Everything plays out exactly as you expect, you know, there's people coming from off the map.

199
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:50,385
Speaker 0: that whoo What's what's going on over there?

200
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:53,459
Speaker 0: right, you know, it's like every single trope is there.

201
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:55,387
Speaker 1: I mean, they're everyone.

202
00:13:55,447 --> 00:14:02,109
Speaker 0: every single last fantasy trope is there but they're all executed Solidly, I mean look at our party like the original party.

203
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:05,540
Speaker 1: We've got the bard who is just straight up a bard.

204
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've got the fighter paladin guy.

205
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:10,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've got the wizard.

206
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, who is like a mega wizard?

207
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:14,149
Speaker 0: She's got.

208
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,433
Speaker 0: all the wizards are mega.

209
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,379
Speaker 1: She's got magic items and an artifact.

210
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,360
Speaker 1: Sure We've got the kid with the magic sword who's also a mage with destiny.

211
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:26,073
Speaker 1: We've got dagger kid who's the thief and wolf kid.

212
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,620
Speaker 1: wolf kid who is a werewolf the blacksmith?

213
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,245
Speaker 1: Who is also an axe wielder?

214
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:34,100
Speaker 0: Yes, it's like someone made the D&D party, right?

215
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:39,300
Speaker 0: So this book doesn't have any you know, social allegories or anything like that.

216
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:39,983
Speaker 0: It doesn't have.

217
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:44,380
Speaker 0: poet has a little tiny bit of poetry, but not anywhere near Lord of the Rings level, right?

218
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,569
Speaker 1: If you try to treat it if you try to treat the poetry and the poetics of these books seriously That's not a good time.

219
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:52,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what you're looking for.

220
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:53,060
Speaker 0: Look elsewhere, right?

221
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:57,630
Speaker 0: And if that bothers you well, it's not enough of it in here to bother you.

222
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just like.

223
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,730
Speaker 0: really it's just a fantasy story.

224
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:08,460
Speaker 1: it's Competently presented not expertly written but very well and competently written.

225
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:12,939
Speaker 1: nothing bothers me about the prose or the writing, you know, it tells its story effectively.

226
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:26,826
Speaker 1: and What's really interesting to me is it reminds me actually a lot of Dumas in The sense that this the pace of the writing and the pace of things happening is pretty much the steady Never-ending slog forward.

227
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like the.

228
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:34,308
Speaker 0: the rate of time passing as you read words Doesn't seem to change very much at all.

229
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:35,633
Speaker 0: They don't time skip anything.

230
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:37,420
Speaker 0: It's not like up three months later.

231
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:38,427
Speaker 0: That doesn't happen.

232
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:40,460
Speaker 1: It pretty much just skips sleeping and pooping.

233
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:47,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, it skips between the different groups of people as parties split up and rejoin and converge and diverge constantly.

234
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,649
Speaker 0: But it's sort of it just it's like okay.

235
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,695
Speaker 0: Here's what these people did this day.

236
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:54,380
Speaker 0: Here's what these people did this day.

237
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,959
Speaker 0: Here's what these people did this day next day.

238
00:15:57,362 --> 00:16:04,754
Speaker 0: Here's what these people did and it describes, you know It goes into great detail about individual about small things like.

239
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:13,979
Speaker 0: they'll go into say A stable and it'll take the time to like list all the horses that are in the stable and describe them.

240
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,629
Speaker 1: and It's the way D&D like Dungeon Master Notes about the story go right.

241
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,600
Speaker 0: every single in it takes care to mention the name of the inn.

242
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,388
Speaker 0: What logo is on the sign of the inn?

243
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:28,176
Speaker 0: you enter the common room every single in that he enters.

244
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:29,300
Speaker 0: they describe who's in the?

245
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,477
Speaker 0: Common room, you know how big it is.

246
00:16:32,544 --> 00:16:33,629
Speaker 0: Who's the innkeeper?

247
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,860
Speaker 0: I've read like 20 different inns already.

248
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:39,953
Speaker 1: They're all distinct and you kind of like we were talking about.

249
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:41,500
Speaker 0: they all matter, right?

250
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,211
Speaker 1: Like when they when the kids get to bear lot who's performing in the inn?

251
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:46,958
Speaker 0: if anyone what kind of people are?

252
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:47,240
Speaker 0: is it a?

253
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,993
Speaker 0: Drunken in a partying in

254
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:49,900
Speaker 1: they went to the bed

255
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,636
Speaker 0: There'll be hold there'll be like Pages where they go around town looking at all the inns to pick one to sleep in but

256
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:58,789
Speaker 1: then they end up sleeping in the one With the innkeeper tries to murder them and rob them.

257
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,817
Speaker 0: right, you know, but that's how it goes.

258
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:03,367
Speaker 1: Yeah But also but they accept.

259
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:06,659
Speaker 1: there's what I noticed I was flipping back through at the end of the last book.

260
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:25,460
Speaker 1: The one area where this actually fails is kind of a flaw in the books is that when there are intense action scenes, sometimes they're written that same way and A few times like the last few battles in the first book They're written so abstractly that you can't actually follow what happened.

261
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:34,351
Speaker 1: I agree with that like Flames from the sword and the check clashing of the whatever and it just sort of Describes a bunch of verbs and nouns in a row and then the battles.

262
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:36,940
Speaker 0: it felt a lot like a try gun manga battle scene.

263
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:41,856
Speaker 1: It was the opposite of and then they stepped into the circle inscribed by his sword.

264
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,738
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly That's some prints of nothing right there, right?

265
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,280
Speaker 0: But but other than that it kind of I think part of that's intentional too, right?

266
00:17:50,620 --> 00:18:05,604
Speaker 0: Cuz that I mean I can tell you the battle scenes like the second book very similar You know, you don't really figure out exactly what's going on and in sort I think they don't want you to know a hundred percent exactly what's going on in a literal end of Evangelion kind of partly

267
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:10,540
Speaker 1: because then like fantasy combat doesn't really work because people get in.

268
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you made a movie you could you could do, you know actually cool action scenes But that's not what this is about.

269
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:23,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, the combat that like the fights in the book It's like they just they sort of just describe it enough that they can lead you into the consequences of the battle happening.

270
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:35,849
Speaker 1: Which is the important part, you know it reads like a D&D combat encounter like they were fighting and he was fighting with him and she was fighting with him and Then it was over and the sidewalk this guy got stabbed.

271
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:36,530
Speaker 0: He's wounded.

272
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:39,880
Speaker 0: that guy, you know disappeared that one's dead.

273
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:41,412
Speaker 0: You know that sort of thing.

274
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:41,956
Speaker 1: They're also.

275
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:50,529
Speaker 1: it's a very Unsurprising and unchallenging book which might just be because we're old and jaded and we've read a lot of books and seen a lot for being so big.

276
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:57,882
Speaker 1: I read this really fast and Literally, nothing comes as a surprise everything whatsoever.

277
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:02,468
Speaker 1: everything is foreshadowed adequately and obviously Like you see the check-offs gone.

278
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,674
Speaker 0: it fires the check-offs gun.

279
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:04,800
Speaker 0: it fires the check-ups gun.

280
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:07,326
Speaker 0: It holds on another check-ups Gum comes out and fires in the first check.

281
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:13,160
Speaker 1: I'm going fires and the ones that don't fire fire immediately in the next book Like a fire later, but and it does this throw a little man.

282
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know I mean we only talking about book one.

283
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,599
Speaker 0: But let me tell you book two the first chapter of book two might as well could easily be.

284
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:21,854
Speaker 0: It's exactly the next chapter.

285
00:19:21,935 --> 00:19:25,880
Speaker 0: after you end a book one You can just stick all these books together because I'm in book three now.

286
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,327
Speaker 0: I can tell you it happened twice so far.

287
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:36,420
Speaker 0: you could just put the book side by side and cut them anywhere you like To separate the books and it wouldn't really make a big difference.

288
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:41,415
Speaker 0: the only I think the only reason they chose like those spots to end one book and start another.

289
00:19:41,435 --> 00:19:53,100
Speaker 0: because it's like after the culmination and Denoma epilogue after one of the more major battle at a conflict resolution parts That's when they cut the book off and start the next one.

290
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then it builds up and then there's the next major battle with the big bad guy.

291
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,728
Speaker 1: But like you learn about the ice today.

292
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:03,947
Speaker 1: and then as said I yeah I think I don't know how to say it.

293
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:04,792
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's ice.

294
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:16,551
Speaker 0: I don't know how to pronounce anything But my brain my brain is always says as said I took my brain a minute to read a guinea and not just say Mine says a Gwen in my brain.

295
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:17,094
Speaker 1: It's a guinea.

296
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,179
Speaker 0: I think who knows?

297
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:19,647
Speaker 0: How about how?

298
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:20,655
Speaker 0: about Neneve?

299
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:26,174
Speaker 0: At least Elaine is easy.

300
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:29,425
Speaker 0: Yeah It could be wrong.

301
00:20:29,506 --> 00:20:30,168
Speaker 1: It's Rand.

302
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:30,670
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

303
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,392
Speaker 0: I hope it's Rand.

304
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:32,094
Speaker 1: better be random.

305
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:32,757
Speaker 1: It's Ron.

306
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:33,499
Speaker 1: I hope he dies.

307
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:42,735
Speaker 1: So Ruby Ron I Can watch that movie again.

308
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:49,594
Speaker 1: sure I Did not like any of those boys for three quarters.

309
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:56,336
Speaker 1: that book Rand was okay But he was a little Shinji, but Matt just they're all kind of Shinji.

310
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:59,231
Speaker 0: Rand is the motion G But he is bad wasn't that Shinji?

311
00:20:59,272 --> 00:21:00,560
Speaker 1: Matt was just stupid.

312
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Matt was the dumb one Matt almost got them killed so many times.

313
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:08,700
Speaker 1: I expected him to die expected him and parent to both.

314
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:17,531
Speaker 0: I think I think part of the reason there is that way is because they want to show you them like how quickly they grew Up, and they're constantly doing things like wow just like a year ago.

315
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,394
Speaker 0: They were in.

316
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:20,500
Speaker 0: yeah, you know they were in their peasants.

317
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:21,500
Speaker 0: They're being stupid.

318
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:22,284
Speaker 0: And it does work.

319
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:32,000
Speaker 1: cuz like in the second book you start to read or even the end of the first book and they're like Kind of competent adventurers, and then you're ridiculously confident in book three like not many chapters back like in book three.

320
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,776
Speaker 0: They're powerful you know leveled up dudes, but like it mentioned everybody every character.

321
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:43,760
Speaker 1: you learn about the ice today And it mentions later like well What if you met a whatever aja and then you learn about there's colors of aja?

322
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:44,823
Speaker 1: And you start.

323
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:51,297
Speaker 0: I thought at first I thought the red aja was like a person and that some of the a said I followed The red aja, but yup, it's like.

324
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:53,185
Speaker 0: no They're just in a group called the red.

325
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:55,011
Speaker 1: that is a trope of fantasy books.

326
00:21:55,352 --> 00:22:02,816
Speaker 1: use a proper noun in context without explanation Yeah, then later use it in context again to clarify what type of thing it is.

327
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:06,288
Speaker 1: then later Reveal one of them.

328
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:06,549
Speaker 1: It's like.

329
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:09,206
Speaker 1: later you learn like what one of them is But there's still a lot of mysteries.

330
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,640
Speaker 1: the second you know that's at the end of the first book.

331
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,186
Speaker 1: There's no more explanation for that.

332
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:14,732
Speaker 1: immediately the second book.

333
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:22,460
Speaker 1: It's like it goes through this whole Build up, and then it just tells you what color a bunch of the characters are wearing and then you're like oh

334
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:46,280
Speaker 0: Yeah Another trope this book has is a thing will happen right and you the reader will learn an important piece of information and so will Some character right will learn that same information and then for many chapters You see what happens as that information does or does not spread to other characters.

335
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:52,680
Speaker 0: Yeah Which is actually cool because you and then that in books and then another thing Happens or another thing is learned.

336
00:22:52,800 --> 00:23:15,086
Speaker 0: So it's like all that time all those pages are really taken up by other characters learning After you've learned something and the effects of that and then that somehow You know sort of dragging everyone into the next happening which creates more learning and more information coming out and then Process repeats itself over and over.

337
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:19,780
Speaker 0: like at one point there were like I think like the beginning of book three.

338
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:27,887
Speaker 0: It's like all the chapters are like everyone learning what happened at the end of book two and even now I just the chapter.

339
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:37,985
Speaker 0: I just read it was a Character was introduced somewhere in the middle of book three and they just learned what happened at the end of book two and it's like oops Someone slipped.

340
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:46,258
Speaker 1: now that would be really annoying except it kind of works because like you pointed out It doesn't retell the story like a lot of bad authors would do.

341
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:51,260
Speaker 1: instead It just focuses on the reaction and the consequences of that person learning that thing.

342
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:55,099
Speaker 1: Yep But at the same time because if we're talking about the first book here.

343
00:23:55,661 --> 00:24:01,717
Speaker 1: Fucking Rand and Matt and Perrin would all independently learn really important stuff and not tell anyone.

344
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,455
Speaker 0: and up in book one There's a lot more not telling.

345
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:24,092
Speaker 0: because Matt the not telling enables these slower spreading of the information and the World is after you and the winner is in your dream and this wizard is protecting you and the Wizard about it.

346
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:32,900
Speaker 1: the Wizards protecting you specifically said Repeatedly if you have any weird dreams tell me it's what they don't and they don't trust her either.

347
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:33,644
Speaker 1: But then they won't.

348
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:36,400
Speaker 1: then they tell the bard and the barge like trust the bard?

349
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:37,162
Speaker 1: No They don't.

350
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:40,756
Speaker 0: only later because they're forced to because they trust the bard way more than the wizard.

351
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:43,609
Speaker 1: well toward the end Pretty sure he's not dead.

352
00:24:44,394 --> 00:24:47,306
Speaker 0: No, he's not of course not Pretty much.

353
00:24:47,326 --> 00:24:50,465
Speaker 0: I mean like Characters don't die.

354
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:56,300
Speaker 0: main characters don't seem to die easily and that way they can keep going away and coming back, right?

355
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,083
Speaker 0: And so far I don't think any major characters like been completely Removed.

356
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:04,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't.

357
00:25:04,308 --> 00:25:06,820
Speaker 0: I mean like even characters that are minor characters.

358
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,196
Speaker 0: It's like they bother to name someone you they're coming back like that captain of that ship.

359
00:25:11,617 --> 00:25:12,220
Speaker 0: Oh, I like him.

360
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:13,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, the pirate guy.

361
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:14,309
Speaker 0: He's a character.

362
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:15,073
Speaker 0: He's real.

363
00:25:15,374 --> 00:25:15,695
Speaker 0: He comes.

364
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:20,134
Speaker 0: He's not a major character Obviously, but you know, he was a mid to minor character in the book.

365
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:21,259
Speaker 0: And yeah, you see him again.

366
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:23,834
Speaker 0: I are when light it makes you and the thing is.

367
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:30,360
Speaker 0: then later on You see other characters who are similarly minor and you have to assume while they're gonna come back again, aren't they?

368
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,172
Speaker 0: It's like yeah They probably will our place.

369
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:33,080
Speaker 1: are they gonna be like in book?

370
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,213
Speaker 1: 7 like go back to Berlon and stay at one of those ends again.

371
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,600
Speaker 0: There's only so much map to cover.

372
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:38,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're gonna have to.

373
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:41,424
Speaker 0: you know, they can go off the map a little bit I assume.

374
00:25:41,464 --> 00:25:42,974
Speaker 0: but yeah so much you can do.

375
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:50,780
Speaker 1: but like the like So many these little pieces like that like things are mentioned offhand and they seem to always come in at some point.

376
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,759
Speaker 1: Like if you if it mentions a place you're like, I wonder what's going on over there.

377
00:25:54,082 --> 00:25:55,719
Speaker 1: Well something comes out of there soon enough.

378
00:25:55,969 --> 00:26:04,476
Speaker 0: Yeah very much sooner than you expect right, you know Usually the things that are off the edge of the map in most fantasy series like our hawk wings all legendary armies that went over the sea.

379
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:07,811
Speaker 0: It's like they take a long time for those things to like.

380
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:09,999
Speaker 0: you've got to be in a later book to get to that.

381
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:10,947
Speaker 0: the Serious shit.

382
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:12,320
Speaker 0: It's like no it comes pretty quickly.

383
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,800
Speaker 0: It's like it escalates more rapidly than you would think for having so many pages and moving at a steady pace.

384
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:23,120
Speaker 0: Another thing it has a trope in this book that bothers me because I was hoping this would be the one to break that trope.

385
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,991
Speaker 0: That is I've talked about this before many times.

386
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:27,597
Speaker 1: You just want to read the stupid Silmarillion.

387
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:28,500
Speaker 1: Those stories are terrible.

388
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:41,154
Speaker 0: I've read Silmarillion, but someone is not exactly what I want, but there's a chapter early in the book where Moraine talks about the great king and the great hawk wing and all that.

389
00:26:41,214 --> 00:26:42,860
Speaker 0: No, not archer hawk wing, but manetho.

390
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,309
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, right.

391
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,040
Speaker 1: She's obviously in Iran.

392
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:52,547
Speaker 0: she talks about basically these are peasants who live in a place called the two rivers and The two rivers used to be man of Theron.

393
00:26:52,627 --> 00:27:01,496
Speaker 0: and she talks about what man of Theron was and it was basically the fucking Awesomest Kingdom with the baddest ass kings and the baddest ask.

394
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:02,520
Speaker 1: we really want to read that.

395
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:06,785
Speaker 0: Baddest ass heroes like Agamemnon and Achilles.

396
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:16,372
Speaker 0: level of awesomeness right like the baddest asses of the bravest and the goodest and So good, and that's what you want to read and I don't get to know.

397
00:27:16,472 --> 00:27:19,262
Speaker 0: all I get is one chapter about those guys and then Vague hints.

398
00:27:19,643 --> 00:27:26,180
Speaker 0: It's like why I want to read the book where the badass king of man of Theron is the main character of the book.

399
00:27:26,902 --> 00:27:32,180
Speaker 0: You know and then the end of the book can be because clearly man of Theron is not there anymore, right?

400
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:36,095
Speaker 0: The end of the book is the fall of man of Theron and it has a bad ending.

401
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:37,320
Speaker 0: bad guy wins the end.

402
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:37,929
Speaker 0: That's the book.

403
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:45,117
Speaker 1: I want to read okay, and Like get up in your fanfiction Right the wheel of time book zero.

404
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,180
Speaker 0: There is a wheel of time book zero.

405
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,628
Speaker 0: I have to figure out where in this.

406
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,880
Speaker 0: I have to figure out when it was published so I know when to read it.

407
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,702
Speaker 1: God, damn it.

408

Speaker 0: then read 11 12 13 14.

429
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,763
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

430
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:36,726
Speaker 0: So what do you write?

431
00:28:36,726 --> 00:28:36,907
Speaker 0: 679 10 0 11 12 13 14?

432
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:37,469
Speaker 0: That's the order.

433
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,351
Speaker 0: There you go.

434
00:28:41,242 --> 00:28:43,739
Speaker 1: Oh, it's only set 20 years before the events of the first novel.

435
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,760
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's not gonna tell me about the Great King of Man of Therin.

436
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,402
Speaker 1: No, that was.

437
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:52,219
Speaker 0: but it will tell me about Rand's dad maybe Tim Tam and we'll figure out what Rand's.

438
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:53,226
Speaker 0: you know That kind of stuff.

439
00:28:53,488 --> 00:28:57,874
Speaker 1: Yeah with his hair and blade Yeah, where that hair and his Outlander wife, yep.

440
00:28:58,075 --> 00:28:58,477
Speaker 0: Yeah.

441
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,047
Speaker 0: Yeah deals.

442
00:29:00,632 --> 00:29:04,202
Speaker 1: it's almost like Just.

443
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,933
Speaker 1: it is really amazing how and I keep saying this unsurprising these books are.

444
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:14,712
Speaker 1: they follow a thread that is so Directly blazed through a plot that is so obvious.

445
00:29:15,194 --> 00:29:16,880
Speaker 1: and yet at the same time you guys want to keep reading.

446
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:19,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you poke it around like alright, these guys are coming.

447
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,859
Speaker 0: I wonder what their deal and it's the way the thing is.

448
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:32,482
Speaker 0: I think the reason it seems so obvious is that they tell you the reader Something right and they tell it to you in such a way that you being smart a reader Right.

449
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,545
Speaker 0: You don't need to be that smart.

450
00:29:34,026 --> 00:29:36,532
Speaker 0: you get that information and you know it.

451
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:47,716
Speaker 0: you're like, I know this fact now, but They wrote it in such a way that it leaves a little bit of doubt in your mind Even though it was so obviously just told to you.

452
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:56,000
Speaker 0: and then later They tell you that same fact again in a way that a hundred percent confirms that the thing you thought was right to begin with.

453
00:29:56,303 --> 00:29:57,519
Speaker 0: They never do the opposite.

454
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,168
Speaker 0: Maybe they will later on like at the end who knows.

455
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:04,460
Speaker 0: so basically confirming the thing they hinted at being true is indeed true.

456
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:05,139
Speaker 0: You're suspicious.

457
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:09,380
Speaker 0: 99% confidence level is actually 100% confidence level.

458
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:13,138
Speaker 0: So it makes it seem as if it was obvious when really it's like.

459
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:16,051
Speaker 0: no You were supposed to be the first time.

460
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:17,759
Speaker 0: they told you a hundred percent sure.

461
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,160
Speaker 1: Well, here's an example of how that all plays together everything we said.

462
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:33,645
Speaker 1: So there's a point early on where Maureen I think is the one who explains to other people That a woman who has the ability to use magic if she isn't found by the eyes today and trained she'll get these sicknesses Mm-hmm, and then she'll be fine.

463
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,300
Speaker 0: And then as soon as she says that you're like, well all these main character girls are magical.

464
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:40,954
Speaker 0: Yep, you just know it immediately like I bet that yeah, they're probably on that.

465
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:41,978
Speaker 0: and then yes, they are.

466
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:45,884
Speaker 1: but then Well later, uh Iguana is like fuck.

467
00:30:45,904 --> 00:30:46,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll be a wizard.

468
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,733
Speaker 1: fuck this nonsense to River's bull.

469
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:50,178
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I like her.

470
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:57,420
Speaker 1: Yeah Meanwhile the wisdom In a minute is like I'm not no wizard fuck wizards.

471
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:01,512
Speaker 1: But then when she learns about the sickness thing, she's like I got sick as a kill.

472
00:31:01,572 --> 00:31:01,933
Speaker 1: Fuck.

473
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,236
Speaker 1: Fuck me.

474
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:11,140
Speaker 1: Oh, no But then later you get a flashback where Matt is like, yeah ran got really sick while we were traveling.

475
00:31:11,221 --> 00:31:12,049
Speaker 1: It was kind of weird.

476
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:13,080
Speaker 1: now that came out of nowhere.

477
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:20,659
Speaker 1: And of course Randy's the dragon reborn Of course as the per the title of book three and all the foreshadowing of book one.

478
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:22,226
Speaker 0: But who do you think is a dragon reborn?

479
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:23,713
Speaker 0: Hmm Rand?

480
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:24,054
Speaker 0: Yeah.

Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like oh, there's a cat There's someone named.

482
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,764
Speaker 0: I mean That's actually the bet.

483
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:34,358
Speaker 0: the one thing that's another thing this book does that I love is chapter one and actually the same chapter one that the prince of nothing has.

484
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:39,770
Speaker 0: It's that chapter one of Not the main characters.

485
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,466
Speaker 0: another time another place Something else right.

486
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:47,280
Speaker 0: and the chapter one of this book is lose Theron the real dragon, right?

487
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,624
Speaker 0: Definitely the dragon.

488
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:50,732
Speaker 1: Yep in his end insanity, right?

Speaker 0: He's called lose Theron kinslayer.

490
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:53,123
Speaker 0: Why?

491
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,780
Speaker 0: well because after he you know, basically the murdered everyone he'd ever known.

492
00:31:57,162 --> 00:32:01,824
Speaker 0: So if you if you if you didn't yeah, this is all in book one if you didn't read book one What the fuck you doing?

493
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:02,286

00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:04,033
Speaker 0: so lose Theron.

495
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:05,359
Speaker 0: He's the dragon, right?

496
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:11,049
Speaker 0: He's a ridiculously powerful magical dude, right and he's the awesomest most powerful dude.

497
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:15,335
Speaker 0: and the bad guy Chetan, oh, I shouldn't say his name.

498
00:32:15,536 --> 00:32:25,210
Speaker 0: Yeah Book two One time and shit goes down like immediately Balsam on the bad guy Satan right the dark.

499
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, literally based on Satan like go read.

500
00:32:27,517 --> 00:32:29,502
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's the bad guy Right.

501
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:44,355
Speaker 0: he and all the other magical dudes and ladies of that time the eight in right of his age They beat the bad guy and in so doing so imprisoned him in the mountain of doom the stereotypical mountain of doom Right, which is called shale ghoul or whatever all the bad guys.

502
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:44,918
Speaker 0: It's Mountain Doom.

503
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:47,285
Speaker 1: Come on It's all go got her off.

504
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:47,867
Speaker 0: Yes.

505
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:48,850
Speaker 0: It's the bad place.

506
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:51,379
Speaker 0: You know, it's it's always named doom.

507
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:55,817
Speaker 0: They imprisoned him there and in doing so right they sealed him up.

508
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:56,500
Speaker 0: They couldn't kill him.

509
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:07,677
Speaker 0: they sealed him up in this mountain and that was like a plus move, but The bad guys last move his last move before being imprisoned is the backstroke of the West in one sense.

510
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:12,016
Speaker 1: Yes the backstroke Well, they call it a backstroke like four times.

511
00:33:12,136 --> 00:33:23,475
Speaker 0: Sure He breaks is the breaking of the world right in where people they paint half of the the gendered magic Which the magic is gendered into the male half and the female half.

512
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:25,283
Speaker 0: so the bad guy Poisons.

513
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:27,591
Speaker 0: he basically puts his icky darkness all over.

514
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:29,820
Speaker 0: the man half of the magic.

515
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,148
Speaker 1: So now the touch the man half.

516
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:35,280
Speaker 1: to touch it you have to go through all of his bad guy.

517
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,824
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have to like.

518
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:40,652
Speaker 0: there's like a film of nasty oil on This pool of man magic.

519
00:33:40,712 --> 00:33:42,180
Speaker 0: the lady magic is fine.

520
00:33:42,662 --> 00:33:47,780
Speaker 0: If you try to use the man magic you have to sort of go through the icky muck that's floating on top.

521
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:50,899
Speaker 0: But and it slowly drives you insane and bad and whatnot.

522
00:33:51,563 --> 00:34:02,180
Speaker 0: So all these magic dudes including lose Theron kin slayer the awesome You know dragon go insane and ruin the world and destroy all the kingdoms and fuck everything up.

523
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:05,099
Speaker 0: And that's why he's kin slayer because he killed all of his kin.

524
00:34:05,381 --> 00:34:09,599
Speaker 1: Yeah chapter one and the whole book is all this precursor stuff of like the angry like.

525
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:12,054
Speaker 1: yeah This is just something we could just make all the time.

526
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:21,251
Speaker 0: so much Mysterious precursor shit from the age of legends which I think is even older than like mana Theron and lose Theron and all that It's like in a lock Lamora.

527
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,339
Speaker 1: like what's that crystal thing?

00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:24,424
Speaker 0: Same same deal.

529
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:27,857
Speaker 0: There's some precursor stuff from people who are even better than the people were dealing.

530
00:34:27,877 --> 00:34:27,978
Speaker 0: like.

531
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:34,728
Speaker 1: there's the place They mentioned like it's a cool place then match like why don't we go fucking loot it and the guys like Anyone who goes anywhere near there just suddenly dies.

532
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:35,552
Speaker 1: No one knows why.

533
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:36,435
Speaker 0: don't do that.

534
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:39,768
Speaker 1: I Feel like that place is gonna come up at some point though.

535
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:41,797
Speaker 1: Every other place comes up at some point.

536
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,704
Speaker 0: Yep there's also a lot of like shit.

537
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:51,324
Speaker 1: our leg off seems to be almost as dangerous as the bad bad and It's a different bad.

538
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:52,347
Speaker 1: What was that?

539
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:52,768
Speaker 1: That was the.

540
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:54,594
Speaker 1: that was the evil that man-made themselves.

541
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's also like the ways.

542
00:34:56,882 --> 00:35:07,400
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah with the the black wind, but it's when I think about the first book like unlike other fantasy books It's like they'll have like a few of those tropes and then their main story.

543
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:09,711
Speaker 1: This book is just everything.

544
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:11,480
Speaker 1: just everything's crammed into there.

545
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,075
Speaker 1: The ways would be like a big deal in any other Fanny series here.

546
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:17,460
Speaker 1: They just go in there once.

547
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:18,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.

548
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:19,787

Speaker 0: it's like they just fill the fantasy world with every single fantasy thing.

550
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:27,950
Speaker 0: It's like he's got the heron blade Right and you think that's the Excalibur.

569
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:31,377
Speaker 0: so you blow the horn and like the ghost of Artur Hawkwing and like all the legends of legends just show up and Fight for you much like Lord of the Rings.

570
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:35,720
Speaker 0: Yeah There's already a deal with the ghost to come and fight for him.

571
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll follow whoever blows the horn and there's also some debate.

572
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:42,790
Speaker 0: and Lord of the Rings They'll follow whoever has a Narsil the sword of the king.

573
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:47,277
Speaker 1: of course hither - there's also some debate as to what the blowing the horn actually specifically does.

574
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:54,098
Speaker 0: The horn does very specifically because you know what spoilers that horn getting blown.

575
00:36:54,118 --> 00:36:55,842
Speaker 0: Yo, they don't Fuck.

576
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:56,247
Speaker 0: three.

577
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,797
Speaker 0: I'm not telling you but The book does not hold back cuz I'm a little pissed off.

578
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:05,759
Speaker 1: in book two They just put it in the closet like they just put it in like a normal closet like good job guys.

579
00:37:06,163 --> 00:37:07,499
Speaker 0: Well, you know, they can't let anyone know.

580
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,931
Speaker 0: Remember the people from Italy everyone else do.

581
00:37:09,972 --> 00:37:11,620
Speaker 0: a great hunt from the horn has begun.

582
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,247
Speaker 0: There are people going all over the place looking for the horn the Amarillo new Iglemar knew they knew you can't.

583
00:37:18,307 --> 00:37:21,436
Speaker 0: you can't blow it thinking of glory or sell a salvation.

584
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:24,684
Speaker 0: You have to blow it thinking of Only salvation.

585
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,191
Speaker 0: right only salvation not glory.

586
00:37:26,473 --> 00:37:27,437
Speaker 0: blow it thinking of glory.

587
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:35,000
Speaker 1: It's bad news You know, I also noticed there's a few points where Maureen specifically hides information from land because it might make him feel bad.

588
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:39,565
Speaker 0: Remember as said I always have to tell the truth So she doesn't see.

589
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:49,300
Speaker 0: basically just avoid saying things and I every time and as said I talks You have to read it like you're fucking giving a wish to a genie to make you know, cuz like they can't lie.

590
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,647
Speaker 0: So, you know, they're telling the truth.

591
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,686
Speaker 0: You got to make sure like, okay, so Is that actually true?

592
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,232
Speaker 0: You know, where's the other people?

593
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:58,140
Speaker 0: you don't have to examine what they're saying nearly as much.

594
00:37:58,261 --> 00:37:59,700
Speaker 0: But as said I has dialogue.

595
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,820
Speaker 0: It's like well fuck me after read this like half as fast just to make sure cuz I know they're not lying.

596
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:09,076
Speaker 0: So they're probably weaseling or neglecting to say certain things.

597
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:18,900
Speaker 1: So The fact that the magic is gendered and that is like a core part of this world Doesn't bother me enough to make a deal about it?

598
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:19,764
Speaker 0: I don't think it's.

599
00:38:20,627 --> 00:38:23,480
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't think you can accuse these books of being sexist.

600
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:29,960
Speaker 1: No, actually because it passes the Bechdel test like all the not only does it pass the Bechdel test But it hits the Bechdel test out of the park.

601
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:37,689
Speaker 0: The ladies are like mad powerful and they take care of their own shit and they're They're not just as main characters.

602
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,757
Speaker 0: If not more main characters than you know, it is.

603
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:50,360
Speaker 0: they're Tevarin yeah, and in fact because the The dude magic is poisoned pretty much all the powerful people are ladies and they're doing all the important shit.

604
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,240
Speaker 0: But then not all the powerful ladies are wizards like there's very few awesome dudes and they're kind of lame.

605
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:56,845
Speaker 1: But it's definitely like.

606
00:38:56,885 --> 00:39:03,990
Speaker 1: there's definitely a feminist female empowerment like aspect of these books which I like and It's just pretty you know egalitarian.

607
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,560
Speaker 0: like there's strong and weak people of all genders.

608
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:16,735
Speaker 1: But it focuses a lot fantasy races like in the early chapters on heavily balancing and making it clear that like the women's circle is Actually just as powerful as the town count.

609
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:20,186
Speaker 1: It's more powerful than That's what the impression you get.

610
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:27,059
Speaker 1: Yes, but I guess I'd say that it has strong female Protagonists that are not strong female protagonists.

611
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:29,951
Speaker 0: Actually, they're not proper noun strong female.

612
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:34,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's actually no protectionist There's just this protagonist of every kind of shape and size.

613
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:36,455
Speaker 0: Yeah You know.

614
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:40,499
Speaker 0: The one one thing though is that and it comes to bad guys.

615
00:39:41,306 --> 00:39:53,492
Speaker 0: There seems to be I am even there seems Yes, but there seems to be one female bad guy at least one In of the extremely powerful ones, yeah that are legendary.

616
00:39:53,552 --> 00:39:57,648
Speaker 0: there's like one is the token woman bad guy And then the rest are all dudes.

617
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:06,240
Speaker 1: I have a worrying Prediction about that one because it's outside of the first book and I can't necessarily like I don't want to spoil anything.

618
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:11,160
Speaker 0: Yes, it's exactly what you think because like I said before yeah, if you're 90% sure about something you should be a hundred.

619
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,124
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure about it.

620
00:40:12,224 --> 00:40:21,460
Speaker 1: Yes, it worries me that that is going to be that characters like Ideal or core and I worry it'll be a tiny bit problematic.

621
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:26,515
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, I'll mention after the show sure cuz you know, that's I learn about.

622
00:40:26,535 --> 00:40:38,140
Speaker 0: you learn about that shit in like the middle of Book two right anyway, but yet so, you know book one for you know Something that started out as peasants right at the end of but you think it's gonna take a long time before the epic shit.

623
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,760
Speaker 1: No, they're like seventh eighth level D&D characters.

624
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:48,232
Speaker 0: But like at the end of book one just somehow With despite having the steady pacing they managed to get from.

625
00:40:48,252 --> 00:40:52,926
Speaker 0: it's like when they're when the party gets split and they're trying to Cross the world from west to east.

626
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:55,334
Speaker 0: it's like that part sort of feels like it's right.

627
00:40:55,856 --> 00:41:01,160
Speaker 0: and then before you know it It's like they're up fighting the big bad guy up at like the edge of the world.

628
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,140
Speaker 0: We're like the trial, you know at the wall.

629
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,603
Speaker 0: You know the stereotypical like l5r wall where the bad guys are on the other side and they marched through the gate and they go Into the.

630
00:41:09,723 --> 00:41:16,537
Speaker 0: you know the evil, you know waste of the world of lights And they find the magic horn and shit and like the green man is there and everything.

631
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:20,733
Speaker 0: and it's like, whoa They really got to the super powerful shit right away.

632
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:22,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then book two just keeps going up.

633
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,524
Speaker 1: It's just an upward slant.

634
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:24,427
Speaker 0: It does not stop.

635
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,756
Speaker 1: They're gonna be 20th level by like the fourth book.

636
00:41:26,796 --> 00:41:27,840
Speaker 1: I'd bet maybe a third.

637
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,446
Speaker 1: It goes way faster than you but what epic they Epic level like so fast.

638
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:35,825
Speaker 0: I don't even know what's gonna have.

639
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:38,397
Speaker 0: I can't even imagine how epic he gets a book five six seven.

640
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,986
Speaker 1: at the end One punch man comes down.

641
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,474
Speaker 0: I mean, it's basically one punch man versus one punch man.

642
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:50,840
Speaker 1: already as far as I can tell If nothing else what I can say is I'm digging these books enough to keep reading.

643
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,251
Speaker 0: I mean if you're a nerd you're gonna like fantasy novel and this has.

644
00:41:54,271 --> 00:42:01,460
Speaker 0: there's a reason you like fantasy novel is because of those Tropes, it's like when you come across one that doesn't follow the tropes that like it stands out as being unique and whatever.

645
00:42:01,982 --> 00:42:12,360
Speaker 0: but how often do you see one that has all the tropes and It just executes them all solidly and it just you have so much, you know, it's like it just never runs out.

646
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,329
Speaker 0: It's like oh, here's more of that thing that you like.

647
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:15,333
Speaker 0: We already know you like.

648
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,920
Speaker 0: why would you why would we mess with it?

649
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,064
Speaker 0: We know it's the thing you like.

650
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:19,228
Speaker 0: Here's more of it.

651
00:42:19,268 --> 00:42:22,279
Speaker 0: here have some more perfectly serviceable delicious steak.

652
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,727
Speaker 0: Yes Oh, you want some more steak?

653
00:42:23,747 --> 00:42:24,089
Speaker 0: Well good.

654
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:25,899
Speaker 0: There are 20 more giant books just like it.

655
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:35,711
Speaker 1: so like if Lord of the Rings is like the fancy expensive restaurant that you just go to occasionally because it is like super good and Prince of nothing is like the weird place that you kind of like.

656
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:39,548
Speaker 1: but you don't either that the foreign food with like The food's weird.

657
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:40,614
Speaker 1: It makes you sick sometimes.

658
00:42:40,734 --> 00:42:46,107
Speaker 1: Sure And Forgotten realms is McDonald's.

659
00:42:46,388 --> 00:42:49,400
Speaker 1: Yes, then these books are like Chipotle.

660
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:53,392
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a little better than Chipotle Chipotle with the eso Fritas.

661
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:55,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like it's not quite cafe Maya.

662
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:59,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like you eat there a few times a week and it's totally serviceable.

663
00:42:59,701 --> 00:43:00,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

664
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:02,093
Speaker 0: yeah, do I want to eat there?

665
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:03,380
Speaker 0: Yes, I would like to eat there.

666
00:43:03,701 --> 00:43:05,168
Speaker 0: Would I say it is my favorite restaurant?

667
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:07,460
Speaker 0: No, is it the restaurant I go to most?

668
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:10,828
Speaker 0: No, but I go there a lot.

669
00:43:10,948 --> 00:43:12,857
Speaker 1: Well, cuz there's a lot of words a lot of pages.

670
00:43:13,118 --> 00:43:15,766
Speaker 1: Yeah And how many lunches do you eat?

671
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:18,700
Speaker 1: You only you can only stray so far from your office in New York.

672
00:43:18,821 --> 00:43:26,140
Speaker 0: So I think the lesson to learn here is when you see something I mean, I've learned this lesson already, which is why I made this which is why I made this decision, right?

673
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,660
Speaker 0: It's like I keep hearing about this thing called fist of the North Star.

674
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:30,138
Speaker 0: I should probably go and see what that is, huh?

675
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:36,020
Speaker 0: So this wheel of time thing that is a thing I know about as a nerd But I've never read it or looked into it in any way whatsoever?

676
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:37,384
Speaker 0: Maybe you should.

677
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:40,053
Speaker 0: is there's a nerdy thing you've heard of right?

678
00:43:40,073 --> 00:43:42,180
Speaker 0: Like I saw I've met some people like it packs.

679
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,762
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, I've never played any Castlevania's.

680
00:43:44,802 --> 00:43:46,249
Speaker 0: it's like you've heard of it though.

681
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:46,410
Speaker 0: Yeah.

682
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:46,611
Speaker 0: Yeah.

683
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:48,420
Speaker 0: Well, maybe you should check that the fuck out.

684
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,220
Speaker 0: So think about the nerdy things that are out there that are popular among nerds.

685
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:54,950
Speaker 0: You know that you know exist but haven't checked out.

686
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:59,185
Speaker 0: and make a list and check them all the fuck out in order Like if you'd help it.

687
00:43:59,245 --> 00:44:02,497
Speaker 0: if you need help putting them in order ask me and I'll put them in order for like.

688
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:04,307
Speaker 1: I don't Like Game of Thrones.

689
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:05,092
Speaker 0: No, I don't.

690
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,283
Speaker 0: I checked it out.

691
00:44:07,363 --> 00:44:08,266
Speaker 0: I did check it out.

692
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,309
Speaker 1: I know it's deal.

693
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Evangelion a lot of you hate Evangelion.

694
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,067
Speaker 1: You're wrong, but that's a fine opinion to have.

695
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:19,000
Speaker 0: but some of you know, even jellying is a thing and you haven't checked it.

696
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,167
Speaker 0: But at least check it.

697
00:44:20,629 --> 00:44:20,931
Speaker 0: check it.

698
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:22,339
Speaker 0: people here about it.

699
00:44:22,781 --> 00:44:25,190
Speaker 1: I mean we Evangelion's not as old as the wheel.

700
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,097
Speaker 1: It's well depending will the time started being written.

701
00:44:27,117 --> 00:44:29,734
Speaker 0: what like 84 90s I think came out in the 90s?

702
00:44:30,341 --> 00:44:30,620
Speaker 0: I don't know.

703
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,013
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you're a nerd check all the nerd things.

704
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:39,339
Speaker 0: and because you know They're probably good and nerds will like them like you and if they're bad then you can know bad.

705
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:41,415
Speaker 0: You could have stopped a middle way through this book.

706
00:44:41,455 --> 00:44:41,980
Speaker 0: It was awful.

707
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:45,036
Speaker 1: Well, we had to finish it for the book club, but I wouldn't have read the second book.

708
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:53,666
Speaker 1: No And if something's really really bad and all the nerds like it Well now you can call him out on it cuz you've read it, you know Isn't that the best thing?

709
00:44:53,686 --> 00:44:55,999
Speaker 0: when you say all you nerds what's that garbage you're all watching?

710
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:01,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, like that Anna Twitter discussion the other day about code gears where they're all like, yeah, that show is really shit guys.

711
00:45:01,781 --> 00:45:02,664
Speaker 1: Yeah guys.

712
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:06,075
Speaker 0: or just now and we said yeah, you people game of Thrones is garbage.

713
00:45:06,095 --> 00:45:07,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's not garbage.

714
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:10,124
Speaker 0: Just I don't know I'm not it's so.

715
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:12,672
Speaker 0: it's basically like because it's not really.

716
00:45:12,853 --> 00:45:19,614
Speaker 0: it has dragons and stuff, but it's not fantasy novel It's like but also it just happens to be in a medieval ish setting which

717
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:30,608
Speaker 1: is it's gritty political Philosophical deep-feeling fantasy for people who've never read the prince of nothing or anything like that Maybe like they've never encountered challenging fantasy before.

718
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:32,754
Speaker 1: so they see Game of Thrones like who.

719
00:45:32,794 --> 00:45:34,038
Speaker 1: this is the adult stuff.

720
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:34,860
Speaker 1: None of that.

721
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:38,088
Speaker 0: Tell them about Game of Thrones the same way.

722
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:41,600
Speaker 0: I feel about Star Trek where it's actually a different thing.

723
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:42,363
Speaker 0: It's like it.

724
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:47,387
Speaker 0: look, you know Game of Thrones looks like fantasy and Star Trek, you know Looks like sci-fi cuz in space.

725
00:45:47,428 --> 00:45:52,746
Speaker 0: but Star Trek is actually just like a soap opera like days of our lives But it happens to be wearing spacesuits in a spaceship.

726
00:45:52,787 --> 00:46:00,071
Speaker 1: So nerds like I'd say tea tea the originally OS the original series is More like actual sci-fi.

727
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:06,617
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, it's more like Flash Gordon style But yeah, but I mean, you know the ones that are more recent are they see I could write.

728
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:13,480
Speaker 0: whereas Game of Thrones It's like okay It looks like a fantasy novel because they have swords and dragons and shit, but that's not what it is at all, right?

729
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,626
Speaker 0: It's like it's not.

730
00:46:14,686 --> 00:46:15,712
Speaker 0: it's more like Sopranos.

731
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:21,038
Speaker 0: It just happens to have you know Swords and so I hate to say this.

732
00:46:21,922 --> 00:46:28,239
Speaker 1: The writing like the act like the mechanical aspects of the writing like the diction the grammar the word choice all that stuff.

733
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,877
Speaker 1: It's a little bit better than a Rothfuss but not that much better.

734
00:46:33,898 --> 00:46:38,500
Speaker 0: which book Patrick Rothfuss, no, I mean which one are you saying is better but not that much better.

735
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,432
Speaker 1: I think Wheel of Time is a little bit better.

736
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:41,560
Speaker 1: Okay, but not that much.

737
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,766
Speaker 0: I thought you might as well have a game of thrones.

738
00:46:42,806 --> 00:46:47,586
Speaker 1: I think they're both written at about the same level of like Execution in terms of writing writing.

739
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:48,991
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's serviceable.

740
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:50,174
Speaker 0: The content is again.

741
00:46:50,194 --> 00:46:50,776
Speaker 0: It gets it done.

742
00:46:50,796 --> 00:46:51,258
Speaker 0: It's good.

743
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:53,626
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like, you know, I love like.

744
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:59,006
Speaker 0: if I had to grade that aspect, I'd be like BV - yeah Like one full step above Hunger Games.

745
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:03,779
Speaker 1: and even then Hunger Games definitely more better than I said one full step There aren't that many steps.

746
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:14,475
Speaker 0: but Even then like that kind of writing was serviceable because the story I think the thing it really lacks is You know, there's only a few like sayings that you can cling to.

747
00:47:14,495 --> 00:47:15,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, we quote the prince of nothing.

748
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:17,568
Speaker 0: Where's your prince of nothing?

749
00:47:17,608 --> 00:47:20,160
Speaker 0: You can like a trackless step shortest path.

750
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:21,544
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

751
00:47:21,564 --> 00:47:23,655
Speaker 0: Whereas in Wheel of Time is like what about the glitters?

752
00:47:23,735 --> 00:47:24,720
Speaker 1: is like everything.

753
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:27,814
Speaker 1: So you like you quote Lord of the Rings you quote prince of nothing.

754
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:29,200
Speaker 1: You don't quote Forgotten Realms.

755
00:47:29,702 --> 00:47:31,712
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't quote the Wheel of Time.

756
00:47:31,873 --> 00:47:33,300
Speaker 0: no, it's not too much quoting to be done.

757
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:38,860
Speaker 1: And and honestly like it doesn't come up that often but when there is prose and poetry and prophecy in the Wheel of Time.

758
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,230
Speaker 0: It's I know not great.

759
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there's a lot of songs people sing.

760
00:47:43,981 --> 00:47:49,420
Speaker 0: I they keep going on and on about how in every town They're all singing the same songs with different words and different names.

761
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:55,507
Speaker 0: So something horrible happened and when I read those lyrics to some of the songs I can't put them to a tune at all.

762
00:47:55,989 --> 00:47:58,400
Speaker 1: I can put them to tunes because of the diction.

763
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:03,413
Speaker 1: Like one of the songs they keep singing is doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

764
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:04,597
Speaker 1: that song, you know, that's.

765
00:48:04,778 --> 00:48:06,704
Speaker 1: oh, it's okay That song over.

766
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,811
Speaker 1: It's all folk songs.

767
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:10,175
Speaker 1: Like I guess just for music theory.

768
00:48:10,195 --> 00:48:16,880
Speaker 1: Like I picked those things out, but You're better off not being able to put them to tunes like for real.

769
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:23,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least the Lord of the Rings like you read those books and those songs are Memorable and good.

770
00:48:23,524 --> 00:48:26,937
Speaker 0: It's also kind of annoying sometimes when they repeat things like that.

771
00:48:26,997 --> 00:48:32,300
Speaker 0: It's like yes We know that in every town they sing the same songs with different lyrics and the songs go by different names.

772
00:48:32,582 --> 00:48:37,548
Speaker 0: You don't need to keep saying we get every Kids every in that you go to.

773
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:40,660
Speaker 1: we don't need kids and you're seeing the wide world for the first time.

774
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,240
Speaker 1: And oh these people seem just like us even in book three.

775
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:49,539
Speaker 0: They went to an inn and there was a lady singing in the end and they pointed out like oh It was a song he knew but it went by.

776
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:52,687
Speaker 0: Dude, I don't know what song it was.

777
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:56,820
Speaker 0: But even in book three, they still going on about this the wind runs through the willows.

778
00:48:57,721 --> 00:48:58,746
Speaker 0: That's the one.

779
00:48:58,786 --> 00:49:00,333
Speaker 0: yes, I think that's the number one song.

780
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:04,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a few more that Don't dig deep.

781
00:49:04,386 --> 00:49:06,640
Speaker 0: I'm not digging anywhere in those territories.

782
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:12,538
Speaker 0: Alright, I think that's the wheels of times to go round and round in the willows.

783
00:49:12,558 --> 00:49:22,007
Speaker 1: I Will pick a book club book after my trip because I'm pretty much gonna keep reading the wheel of time during my trip Hmm.

784
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:24,140
Speaker 1: So also I got to think about what book I want to pick.

785
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,953
Speaker 1: I got a few ideas, but I want to consider.

786
00:49:26,993 --> 00:49:30,890
Speaker 1: I want to see if maybe there's a hot new book I'm ignoring instead of going to something old.

787
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,340
Speaker 0: try to pick have a reason for picking like I did.

788
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,909
Speaker 1: Oh, I always have a reason like a very specific for everything.

789
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:37,675
Speaker 0: I think I like that one.

790
00:49:37,695 --> 00:49:38,919
Speaker 0: There's a pretty cover.

791
00:49:38,939 --> 00:49:42,798
Speaker 1: a Cover could convince me if it was good enough.
